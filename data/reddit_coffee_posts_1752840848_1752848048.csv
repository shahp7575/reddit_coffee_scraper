we stopped at the local coffee shop to for me to grab some fuel and came in to see only one woman in line ahead of me. As I walk forward to join her in line, I hear her and realize that she is getting louder and louder as she absolutely berates the two or three teenagers behind the counter. At this point, I couldn‚Äôt even gather context because she was incoherent, but it was clear that nothing justified this reaction. 
I look back at the handful of workers giving the same  ‚Äú I can‚Äôt do anything about this because I‚Äôm at work, so do your worst.‚Äù stare that I have had to give so many times over, and knew this would be cathartic for us both. 
They are unable to push back against an angry customer without fearing for their job, but I don‚Äôt work there, so I start going in on the lady. I tell her basically what I just highlighted, which is that I couldn‚Äôt even gather context of the situation because she was acting so batshit but that nothing justified that reaction, and much less to a couple of teenagers. I emphasize how sad someone must be to have to take it out on them. She spits some venom back and we go back-and-forth for a minute before the woman actually takes a step or two and gets up in my face like she really means to do something. My mom takes the same sized step towards her and at this point, she backs off and just leaves the restaurant and I step up to order my coffee and apologize that the baristas had to deal with that.  As a thank you, they hooked me up with their discount! 
The next time I came in it was someone else cashing me out but was still another worker that had been there that day, and they didn‚Äôt charge me for my extra espresso shot. By the next few times I came in, word had spread, and now everyone was giving me a discount in different ways. be it by using their personal discount, not charging for my add ons, not charging for my extra shot, ect. It‚Äôs been two years now and I‚Äôm still getting perks when I come in and everybody knows my name & order by heart :) 

I didn‚Äôt mean for it to happen, I was just trying to do the right thing and stand up for somebody, but Karen freaking out over god knows what in an attempt to get a free coffee set me up for years to come!

1m33d7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuperMartScoop/comments/1m33d7n/iphone_case_elegant_leather_iphone_case/,iPhone Case: Elegant Leather iPhone Case,"iPhone Case: Is This Elegant Leather iPhone Wallet Case Worth Ditching Your Wallet For?

Hey r/Shopping and r/DealsReddit,

Anyone else constantly juggling a phone, keys, and a coffee, feeling like a total disaster waiting to happen? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I was so over carrying a separate wallet, especially for quick trips. It felt like I was always about to lose something important. So, I went on a quest for the perfect iPhone case ‚Äì something practical, stylish, and not another cheap plastic thing.

That's when I stumbled upon this ""Elegant leather iPhone wallet case with card holder."" I've tried those flimsy card cases before, and they always crack or the card slots get stretched out. This one looked different, promising a stylish iPhone case that securely holds credit cards, with leather that looked like the real deal.

First impressions? The leather feels amazing! It's not that plasticky, fake leather feel you sometimes get. It actually feels like it will age well and develop a nice patina over time. The stitching is clean, and it just looks...classy. I've already gotten a few compliments, which is a nice bonus. üòâ

But let's get to the real reason I got this: the card holder. It comfortably holds three cards ‚Äì my driver‚Äôs license, debit card, and transit pass. That's all I really need most days. The cards fit snugly, so I don‚Äôt worry about them falling out. I've definitely had that fear with other cases. The secure card storage gives me real peace of mind.

The biggest benefit for me has been the sheer convenience. I can now leave the house with just my phone and know I have everything I need. No more frantically patting my pockets to make sure I have my wallet. No more digging through my bag at the checkout. It's seriously streamlined my life. I feel so much more organized, and it's a small thing, but it really does boost my confidence knowing I'm not a walking disaster zone.

One thing I was worried about was whether it would make my phone feel bulky. It does add a little bit of thickness, but honestly, it's not that noticeable. It's way less bulky than carrying a separate wallet. Plus, the added protection is a bonus. I'm a bit clumsy, so any extra layer of defense for my precious iPhone is welcome. It fits my phone perfectly, doesn't interfere with the buttons or charging port, and I feel like my phone is more protected than with my old, flimsy case.

I did a little digging around online before I bought it and found a few similar options, but this one seemed to have the best reviews for quality and durability. I even checked out ursupermart.com to see if they had any other interesting cases, but I kept coming back to this one. It just seemed like the best combination of style and practicality.

Now, is it perfect? Nothing is, right? If you carry a ton of cards or cash, this probably isn't for you. But if you're like me and just need the essentials, it's a winner. Also, if you're super rough on your phone cases, the leather might show wear and tear over time. But I think that just adds character.

I also thought about the problems this thing solves. Like, how many times have I been digging through my purse at the grocery store, trying to find my debit card while holding a basket full of stuff? This eliminates that completely. Or the anxiety of going out and wondering if I forgot my ID. It's all right there, attached to the one thing I *never* leave home without ‚Äì my phone.

Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase. It's solved a real problem for me, looks great, and feels like it's well-made. It's definitely worth the hype, in my opinion. If you're looking for an elegant iPhone leather case that simplifies your life, I'd definitely recommend checking this one out.

If you're interested in finding an ""iPhone wallet case online"", here's the one I got: [https://go.ursupermart.com/694Vao](https://go.ursupermart.com/694Vao)

Everything they do I end up liking and buying in multiple vitolas, just to try the differences between them. I'll rarely buy anything bigger than a 5-pack for most brands, but for RoMa I will buy by the box. I love their label design and their blends. Maybe the pre-Columbian line is my favorite and from that the Cromagnon Aquitaine, but really I like all of them. I just might've smoked more of this one. 

And it's always a treat to pair it with something different and get a new experience, even if it's a cigar I've smoked 40+ times before. This is probably the Mastodon vitola, with relatively simple flavors of coffee, caramel, pepper and sweetness, but paired with a 6-year-old rum, which is a nice age where flavors of nuts are starting to develop, but the caramel and vanilla are developing nuances and it still retains most of the dryness of the younger rum.

# Best Swing Stand Chair 2025: Reviews & Top Picks

The swing stand chair has emerged as a popular alternative to traditional seating, offering a unique blend of comfort, relaxation, and style. These chairs, suspended from sturdy stands, provide a gentle swaying motion that is both calming and enjoyable. With an increasing number of consumers seeking outdoor and indoor relaxation options, the market for swing stand chairs is booming. Choosing the right model, however, can be overwhelming due to the vast array of styles, materials, and features available. This comprehensive review aims to guide you through the best swing stand chairs of 2025, highlighting their key features, benefits, and suitability for different user needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The best swing stand chairs in 2025 boast a variety of innovative features that enhance their comfort, durability, and safety.

**Weight Capacity:** Knowing the weight capacity is crucial for ensuring safety and longevity. The top models of 2025 offer robust weight limits, typically ranging from 250 to 500 pounds. This allows the chair to accommodate a wide range of users, including adults and even multiple children. Exceeding the weight limit can compromise the structural integrity of the stand and chair, potentially leading to accidents or premature wear and tear.

**Frame Material:** The frame material determines the chair's strength, resistance to the elements, and overall aesthetic appeal. Steel is a popular choice for its durability and ability to support heavy loads. Powder-coated steel offers added protection against rust and corrosion, making it ideal for outdoor use. Aluminum frames are lighter and also rust-resistant, but may not be as strong as steel. The selection of frame material should be guided by the climate and predicted use.

**Chair Material:** The choice of chair material considerably impacts comfort and aesthetics.Wicker, often made from resin or natural fibers, is a classic option that provides a comfortable and breathable seating surface. Fabric chairs, typically made from weather-resistant materials like polyester or olefin, offer a softer and more cushioned feel. Some chairs also incorporate padding or cushions for added comfort, selecting materials which are comfortable and weather-resistant is critical.

**Base Design and Stability:** The base design plays a crucial role in ensuring the chair's stability and preventing tipping.A wide, circular base provides a stable footprint, while a four-legged base offers a more classic look. The base should be made from a durable material like steel or aluminum and should be designed to distribute weight evenly. Some models also feature adjustable feet to compensate for uneven surfaces.

**Ease of Assembly:** A swing stand chair should be relatively easy to assemble, without requiring specialized tools or extensive technical knowledge. The best models come with clear, concise instructions and all the necessary hardware. Features such as pre-assembled components or tool-free assembly mechanisms can further simplify the process. Moreover, easy disassembly can also be a valuable feature for storage and relocation purposes.

**Weather Resistance:** For users who plan to keep their swing stand chair outdoors, weather resistance is a critical factor. The chair and stand should be able to withstand exposure to sun, rain, and wind without significant damage or deterioration.Look for materials that are UV-resistant, waterproof, and rustproof. Fabric chairs should be made from quick-drying materials to prevent mold and mildew growth.

Key features to consider:

   High-quality construction
   Durable materials for outdoor conditions
   Safe and stable design
   Easy assembly and disassembly

## Core Benefits

Swing stand chairs offer a range of benefits that enhance relaxation, comfort, and overall well-being.**Enhanced Relaxation and Comfort:** The gentle swaying motion of a swing stand chair has a calming and therapeutic effect, helping to reduce stress and promote relaxation. The comfortable seating position, often combined with plush cushions, allows you to unwind and escape from the stresses of daily life. Imagine sinking into your swing stand chair after a long day, gently swaying back and forth as you read a book or listen to music.

**Stylish Addition to Any Space:** Swing stand chairs are not only comfortable but also aesthetically pleasing, adding a touch of elegance and whimsy to any indoor or outdoor space. they come in a wide variety of styles,colors,and materials,allowing you to choose one that complements your existing decor. Whether you prefer a modern minimalist design or a more rustic and bohemian look, there's a swing stand chair to suit your taste.**Improved Posture and Back Support:** Unlike traditional chairs, swing stand chairs often promote better posture and back support. The suspended design encourages you to sit upright, reducing strain on your spine and lower back. Some models also feature ergonomic designs and adjustable features that further enhance comfort and support. this makes them an ideal choice for people who suffer from back pain or spend long hours sitting.

**Versatile Usage and Portability:** Swing stand chairs can be used in a variety of settings, both indoors and outdoors. They are perfect for patios, decks, gardens, living rooms, and bedrooms.Some models are also lightweight and portable,allowing you to easily move them from one location to another. This versatility makes them a great addition to any home or lifestyle.

**Increased Outdoor enjoyment:** For nature enthusiasts,a swing stand chair can transform your outdoor space into a personal oasis. Set it up on your porch for morning coffee, in the garden for afternoon reading, or on the deck for evening stargazing. The gentle swaying motion and comfortable seating position will allow you to fully immerse yourself in the sights, sounds, and smells of nature.

## FAQs Section

Common questions:

**Is the Swing Stand Chair safe for children?**

I am a 32-year-old guy heading to San Francisco next week for work, and I'm hoping to explore nudism a bit while in town. I am white, straight, but have been curious, though I have never acted on it, if that matters. I will be in town starting Monday and through the weekend. 

I grew up in a pretty conservative home, and honestly, I think this could be a great step for body confidence and a way to genuinely relax and feel more comfortable in my own skin.

By day, I'm a software engineer, but outside of that, I'm usually lost in a book or out exploring. I actually used to live in SF before work moved me, so I'm pretty familiar with the city.

I'm open to any¬†low-key nudist events¬†that might be happening next week. But honestly, I'd also really appreciate connecting with someone¬†like-minded¬†for a casual coffee, or even just a chill hang-out at my hotel if it feels right. Just looking for comfortable, easygoing connections.

I‚Äôm looking for one emotionally intelligent, financially secure man who‚Äôs genuinely interested in building a long-term connection. Someone confident, consistent, kind, and clear about what he wants.

Physically, I‚Äôve been drawn to all types. My past partners have ranged from slim to fit to a little soft around the edges. What they had in common was that they took care of themselves. Impeccable hygiene, great style, and glasses with a cute smile behind them go a long way with me. I‚Äôm into men who look put together, smell good, and carry themselves with quiet confidence.

Better late than never (43 y/o),"    I never thought I‚Äôd get here a couple years ago! The day I turned 40 in January 2022 I was having my morning coffee and had a little ‚Äúcome to Jesus‚Äù meeting with myself. I realized that I had made some smart financial decisions but also some really dumb ones, and I wanted better for my *hopefully* next 40 years. 

   In that time I have educated myself, follow this sub and a few others, and it has been a game changer for me.  I started off doing what I could, and I have been able to finally see it paying off. I know I‚Äôm a little late to the game, but I‚Äôm playing! I guess the point of this post is to give someone hope that you can do it too, cause I never would have believed it.

Things I had/have going for me:
$2900 monthly military retirement
$11k I had in a CD from a long time ago (ended up adding to this a little and calling it my emergency fund)

What Happened:
Used the GI Bill to go back to school. Graduated in summer of 2021.
Started a job making around 68k/year. 401k was not vested the first year but I contributed 6% as that would be the match when I was vested. Started a Roth IRA and have fully funded it since starting it in 2022. 
In 2023 the entire company got a cost of living increase which bumped me up to 86k/year. 
A few 4-5% raises later and I am at around 99k.

Every year I have increased my contribution to my 401k by my annual raise with the exception of the cost of living raise year, which I think I bumped it up 8% that year. This year will be the 1st year I max it, but I did it and plan to keep doing it!

Investments:
401k - 1/2 traditional, 1/2 in Roth all in Vanguard TDF 2045 with balance this morning of $68.5k
Roth IRA - Was initially all over the place with different funds, but have contributed to SWSTX solely for the past 1 1/2 years, balance this morning is $31.7k

Total: 100,200 invested 

  I know I still have much more to learn, and I‚Äôm not perfect, but I took the first step and started doing SOMETHING. I may not RE, but thanks to you guys I am on my way to FI!

I've just started blogging around coffee topics. My first post is focusing around decaf coffee, how it is made and how it evolved. It is inspired and partially based on [James Hoffman's videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=james+hoffmann+decaf) but also many other interesting sources I found.

I'd be super interested to:

* understand if this is reading material you enjoy
* get input for topics you would be interested in for next articles
* start discussion on your favorite decaf beans (would add your favorites to the summary at the end of the blog).

I have disabled the comment section on my blog, because I would love to foster the discussion around it here on reddit if it is of interest.

**Introduction: The Rise of Quality Decaf**

Decaf coffee was once scoffed at by coffee purists, but attitudes are changing. An increasing number of quality-focused coffee drinkers are embracing¬†**espresso without caffeine**¬†in pursuit of great flavor minus the jitters. In fact, younger generations (Gen Z and Millennials) are driving a decaf renaissance, often choosing decaf to reduce anxiety and improve sleep without sacrificing their coffee ritual. Specialty coffee experts like¬†James Hoffmann¬†note that¬†*‚Äúculture is shifting‚Äù*¬†\-¬†decaf is no longer seen as ‚Äú*not real coffee*,‚Äù and modern decaf can be a delicious option that doesn‚Äôt feel like a compromise. High-end roasters now apply the same craftsmanship to decaf beans as they do to regular beans, meaning you can enjoy rich coffee flavor with minimal caffeine. In this context, it‚Äôs no surprise that interest in¬†**decaf coffee process**¬†and quality has surged among home baristas and coffee connoisseurs.

# The Breaking Point: When Success Becomes Your Prison

Picture this: It‚Äôs 9:47 PM. I‚Äôm sitting in my BMW in the company parking lot, and¬†[I can‚Äôt stop the tears](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub).

Not the dramatic, movie-scene crying. The quiet, defeated kind that happens when you realize your life has become a prison of endless meetings, impossible deadlines, and¬†[pretending everything‚Äôs ‚Äútotally fine‚Äù](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†while your marriage crumbles and your anxiety skyrockets.

That was me at 36 ‚Äî corner office, six-figure salary, zero happiness. My wife had just served divorce papers.¬†[My sleep schedule](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†was destroyed. My¬†[stress management?¬†](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)Three Red Bulls and denial.

**‚ÄúI had climbed the**¬†[**corporate ladder**¬†](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)**only to realize it was leaning against the wrong wall ‚Äî and I was about to fall.‚Äù**

Sound familiar? You‚Äôre not alone. Studies show that 76% of executives report feeling burned out,¬†[with anxiety and depression rates among professionals hitting record highs](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). But here‚Äôs what nobody tells you: there‚Äôs a way out that doesn‚Äôt involve quitting your career or¬†[numbing yourself with medication.](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

Two years later, I‚Äôm writing this from a place I never thought possible: genuine¬†[work-life balance and inner peace](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). And it started with something I would have mocked just a few years ago ‚Äî¬†[chakra meditation](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†and energy healing.

# The Hidden Cost of High-Achieving Burnout: What Chronic Stress Really Does to Your Mind and Body

Let me paint you the real picture of¬†[what executive burnout](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†looks like when nobody‚Äôs watching:

The Physical Breakdown

* **Sleep disruption**: Even when exhausted, my mind raced with¬†[tomorrow‚Äôs problems](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)
* **Anxiety symptoms**: Chest tightness, jaw clenching, constant¬†[low-level panic](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)
* **Emotional numbness**: Food had no taste,¬†[jokes weren‚Äôt funny](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub), nothing brought joy
* **Stress-eating patterns**: Standing up,¬†[mindless snacking](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub), three-coffee mornings

# The Relationship Destruction

My wife needed comfort when her grandmother passed.¬†[I nodded, said ‚Äúsorry,‚Äù¬†](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)and immediately started planning my next presentation. She stood there needing her husband, and I felt‚Ä¶ nothing. Like someone had unplugged my¬†[emotional circuit breaker](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub).

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôre physically here but**¬†[**emotionally absent,**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)**‚Äù**¬†she said during our last real conversation. She was right. I‚Äôd become a ghost in my own life.

# The Career Paradox

Here‚Äôs the irony: the harder I¬†[worked to prove my worth](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub), the less effective I became. Stress was driving¬†[every decision](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). My anxiety was masquerading as productivity, but I was just¬†[spinning wheels faster](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†and faster.

**‚ÄúSuccess**¬†[**without fulfillment is the ultimate failure**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)**. I had the corner office but had lost myself getting there.‚Äù**

# The Science Behind Why Traditional Stress Management Fails (And What Actually Works)

After the divorce,¬†[sitting alone in my studio apartment](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub), I did what any analytical person does ‚Äî I researched. What I discovered changed everything.

**The Stress-Brain Connection**

[Chronic stress](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†literally reshapes your brain:

* **Shrinks areas**¬†responsible for emotional regulation and memory
* **Enlarges regions**¬†that keep you in constant fight-or-flight mode
* **Disrupts sleep patterns**¬†by overproducing cortisol
* **Impairs decision-making**¬†by flooding your system with stress hormones

# The Meditation Solution: Real Science, Real Results

But here‚Äôs the hopeful part:¬†[meditation can actually reverse](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†this damage. Brain imaging studies from Harvard show that just 8 weeks of regular practice can:

* **Strengthen areas**¬†responsible for¬†[learning, memory, and emotional regulation](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)
* **Boost natural ‚Äú**[**happiness chemicals**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)**‚Äù**¬†‚Äî serotonin, dopamine, and GABA
* **Reduce anxiety and depression**¬†as¬†[effectively as medication](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub), without side effects
* **Improve sleep quality**¬†by teaching your¬†[nervous system](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†how to actually relax

When institutions like¬†[Johns Hopkins and Mayo Clinic](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†start integrating¬†[meditation into conventional](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†medical treatments, you know there‚Äôs solid research backing it up.

I was sold. If there was scientific evidence this could help with¬†[stress management and work-life balance](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub), I had to try it.

# Why Most Meditation Apps Failed Me (And How I Found Real Help)

I‚Äôd tried other¬†[wellness apps before](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). You know the type ‚Äî generic guided meditations, pretty graphics,¬†[pre-recorded sessions](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†that felt like digital band-aids for¬†[problems that needed actual healing](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub).

Then I discovered¬†[**coto**¬†during one of those 3 AM anxiety spirals](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub).

[**Real People, Real Time**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub): Instead of pre-recorded content, coto connected me with actual¬†[meditation coaches](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†who could adapt their guidance to what I was feeling in the moment. No more listening to someone tell me to ‚Äú[breathe deeply](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)‚Äù when what I really needed was¬†[someone to help me](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†understand why my chest felt like it was in a vise.

[**24/7 Stress Management Support**:](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†The platform‚Äôs round-the-clock availability literally saved my¬†[sanity during those darkest months](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). When¬†[anxiety hit at 2 AM](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†(which it often did), I could connect with a live meditation coach instead of¬†[spiraling alone with my racing thoughts.](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

[**Male-Friendly Approach**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub): So many wellness spaces feel designed¬†[primarily for women](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). coto felt different ‚Äî welcoming to guys like me who felt awkward about¬†[spiritual practices](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). No judgment, no assumptions about what kind of¬†[person seeks energy healing](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub).

[**Holistic Wellness Integration**:](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†Instead of just basic mindfulness, coto‚Äôs coaches understood¬†[different healing modalities](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). They could combine¬†[guided meditation with chakra healing, breathing techniques with anxiety management, whatever my specific situation needed](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub).

# My First Session: When Meditation Coaching Actually Made Sense

During our first video call,¬†[meditation coach Kajal](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†didn‚Äôt start with mystical concepts or tell me to ‚Äúfind my center.‚Äù She asked about my body.

**‚Äú**[**Where do you feel the stress?**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)**‚Äù**¬†she asked.

‚ÄúEverywhere,‚Äù I said, which made her laugh.

**‚Äú**[**Let‚Äôs get specific. Close your eyes. Scan from your head down. What‚Äôs tight? What‚Äôs numb? What hurts?**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)**‚Äù**

And suddenly I could feel it all ‚Äî the knot in my throat, the heavy feeling in my chest, the¬†[constant tension](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†in my jaw. I‚Äôd been living so disconnected from my physical self that this¬†[simple body scan felt revolutionary](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub).

**‚ÄúYour body keeps the score,**¬†[**even when your mind tries to forget**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)**. We‚Äôre going to teach it how to feel safe again.‚Äù**¬†‚Äî Kajal, my meditation coach

This wasn‚Äôt¬†[abstract spiritual talk](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). This was¬†[practical stress management that I could understand and apply immediately](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub).

# Understanding Your Energy Blueprint: Chakra Healing for Skeptics

Over the months, Kajal¬†[introduced me to practices](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†I‚Äôd never heard of but that made immediate sense for my anxiety and sleep issues:

# The Practices That Changed Everything:

* [**Mantra Jaap**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub): Repetitive chanting that quieted my racing mind in ways I never expected
* [**Pranayama**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub): Breathing techniques that literally changed how my nervous system responded to stress
* [**Mudras**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub): Specific hand positions that seemed silly at first but somehow helped me focus and feel more grounded

# My Chakra Reading: Like Getting an Emotional Blueprint

Think of chakras as¬†[energy centers in your body](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub), like power stations that need¬†[regular maintenance](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†for optimal stress management and emotional balance. When they‚Äôre blocked or imbalanced,¬†[you feel it physically and emotionally.](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

**My main problem areas:**

**Root Chakra (Foundation/Safety)**:¬†[Constant anxiety about money](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub), job security, whether I was ‚Äúenough‚Äù ‚Äî the classic executive burnout pattern

**Heart Chakra (Love/Connection)**: Felt like my heart was behind bulletproof glass ‚Äî¬†[couldn‚Äôt give or receive love effectively](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

**Throat Chakra (Truth/Communication)**: Had become a corporate-speak robot,¬†[never said what I actually meant](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub), suppressed authentic expression

# The Tailored Healing Plan

Based on my energy reading, Kajal created a¬†[**personalized meditation practice**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†targeting my specific blocks:

* **Morning grounding exercises**¬†for¬†[root chakra anxiety](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)
* **Heart-opening**¬†[**breathwork**¬†to reconnect](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†with emotions
* **Throat chakra affirmations**¬†to find my¬†[authentic voice again](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

# The Daily Practice That Transformed My Work-Life Balance

Forget everything you¬†[think meditation](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†looks like. No lotus positions required. No incense (though candles are nice).¬†[Just you, a chair, and 10‚Äì15 minutes.](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

# My Morning Routine That Changed Everything:

**The**¬†[**15-Minute Stress Management Ritual**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)**:**

1. Sit in my¬†[kitchen chair with coffee](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†(yes, caffeine and meditation can coexist)
2. Three¬†[deep breaths to arrive in my body](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)
3. Quick scan from head to toe,¬†[noting what feels tense or numb](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)
4. Send breath to my main energy centers,¬†[focusing on areas](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†that need attention
5. End with¬†[gratitude for something specific](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†from yesterday

Some days I feel like a¬†[meditation master.](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†Other days my mind is like a caffeinated squirrel. Both are fine. The practice isn‚Äôt about perfection ‚Äî it‚Äôs about¬†[showing up consistently for your mental health](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub).

**‚ÄúMeditation**¬†[**taught me that I don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äòon‚Äô all the time**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)**. Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is just breathe.‚Äù**

# The 6-Month Transformation: When Inner Work Shows Up as Outer Success

Six months in,¬†[people started commenting that I seemed different](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). My assistant said¬†[I was ‚Äúmore present‚Äù in meetings](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). My neighbor mentioned I seemed happier. But the real changes were internal:

# Energy and Sleep Improvements:

* [**Stopped needing three cups of coffee**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†by noon ‚Äî natural energy returned
* [**Sleep quality dramatically improved**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†‚Äî fell asleep faster, woke up refreshed
* [**Anxiety attacks decreased**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†from daily to maybe once a month

# Emotional Range Recovery:

* **Felt genuine laughter**¬†for the first time in years watching a stupid comedy special
* **Cried happy tears**¬†reading a news story about a dog rescue
* **Called my sister**¬†just to tell her I love her

# Work Performance Paradox:

Counterintuitively, caring less about being perfect made me more effective.¬†[**Stress wasn‚Äôt driving every decision**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†anymore. I could think clearly, make better choices, and actually enjoy the challenge instead of just surviving it.

**‚ÄúI realized I‚Äôd been treating**¬†[**my career like a sprint when life**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†**is actually a marathon. Slowing down helped me go further.‚Äù**

# Relationship Transformation:

Started dating again, but differently.¬†[Looking for actual connection instead of just filling the loneliness void](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). The emotional availability I‚Äôd lost in my marriage was slowly coming back.

**‚Äú**[**You didn‚Äôt become less ambitious. You became more human.‚Äù**¬†‚Äî Kajal, during month six check-in](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

# The Science-Backed Benefits: Why This Isn‚Äôt Just ‚ÄúWoo-Woo‚Äù

For the skeptics (I was one),¬†[here‚Äôs what convinced me](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†this approach to stress management and emotional wellness isn‚Äôt just wishful thinking:

# Brain Imaging Evidence:

* **Harvard studies**¬†show¬†[meditation literally changes brain structure](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†in just 8 weeks
* **Memory and**¬†[**emotional regulation areas strengthen**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†and these effects stick around even when you‚Äôre not actively meditating
* **Decreased activity**¬†in¬†[brain areas linked to ADHD](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub), anxiety, and cognitive decline

# Medical Institution Integration:

Major medical centers like¬†[**Mayo Clinic now integrate meditation**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†with conventional treatments. They only do this after rigorous testing.

# Long-term Protective Benefits:

Some studies suggest long-term practice might help¬†[**protect against Alzheimer‚Äôs**¬†and other cognitive decline issues.](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

[**The chakra system might be ancient, but the benefits show up on modern brain scans.**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

# Finding Your Tribe: Building Community in Your Healing Journey

One thing I¬†[love about coto is how naturally inclusive it feels](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). There‚Äôs no sense that spiritual work or stress management is ‚Äúfor ladies only.‚Äù Guys from all backgrounds are exploring meditation and energy healing.

# What I‚Äôve Learned About Men in Healing Spaces:

* We‚Äôre often¬†[carrying just as much emotional baggage](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub), we‚Äôre just less practiced at talking about it
* Having male¬†[role models in wellness spaces](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†helps normalize the journey
* There‚Äôs¬†[nothing ‚Äúunmasculine‚Äù about wanting better mental health](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†and work-life balance

# The 24/7 Support That Saved Me:

The platform‚Äôs around-the-clock availability saved me during those¬†[**2 AM anxiety spirals**¬†](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)when everything felt overwhelming. Unlike traditional meditation apps with pre-recorded content, having access to[¬†**live meditation coaches**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†around the clock meant I could get real-time guidance exactly when I needed it most.

# Why Community-Based Healing Works:

* [**Seeing other transformation stories**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†(especially other men) normalized my own journey
* [**Diverse range of meditation experts**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†meant I could explore different approaches
* [**Safe spaces for vulnerability**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†without judgment, whether processing divorce emotions or exploring spiritual practices

# The Ongoing Journey: What ‚ÄúHealed‚Äù Really Means for Work-Life Balance

I‚Äôm not ‚Äúfixed.‚Äù I‚Äôm human.¬†[Some days my chakras feel aligned and I‚Äôm basically a zen master](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub). Other days I‚Äôm stressed about deadlines and my shoulders are up around my ears.

[**The difference is awareness**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)**.**¬†Instead of being hijacked by emotions or energy blocks, I can identify what‚Äôs happening and do something about it.

# My Current Stress Management Toolkit:

* [**Daily 15-minute morning meditation**¬†with coach Kajal](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†(monthly check-ins via coto)
* [**Weekly longer sessions**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†focusing on whatever chakra needs attention
* [**Body scans throughout the day**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†when stress hits
* [**Gratitude journaling practice**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)¬†before sleep for better rest

**‚Äú**[**Healing isn‚Äôt about never feeling stressed again. It‚Äôs about not letting stress drive the car anymore.**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)**‚Äù**

The beautiful thing about this journey is that it‚Äôs not about becoming someone else. It‚Äôs about¬†[**remembering who you were**¬†](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)before the world convinced you to be someone you‚Äôre not.

# Your Next Step: Starting Your Own Stress Management Journey

**This Week**:¬†[Consider connecting with a meditation coach who understands the corporate mindset and life transitions](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

**For Ongoing Support**:¬†[Look for platforms that offer 24/7 meditation guidance, especially during overwhelming periods](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

**Remember**:¬†[Meditation isn‚Äôt about emptying your mind ‚Äî it‚Äôs about changing your relationship with your thoughts and stress patterns.](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

# The Most Important Thing I‚Äôve Learned:

You don‚Äôt have to have it all figured out to begin. You just have to be willing to feel again and prioritize your mental health.

[**‚ÄúCourage isn‚Äôt the absence of fear. It‚Äôs feeling the fear and choosing growth anyway.‚Äù**](https://app.coto.world/NqWZriQw6Ub)

‚Ä¢ Romanticised Indian cofee house (lol this was something new)
‚Ä¢ Typical mention of 'ghar jamai' and 'mach'

**My story**

As a heavy tea drinker I found myself asking for a Cappuccino more than i anticipated, Cappuccino for me before was just a ritual winter seasonal drink and nothing more.  
  
But no, lately all I wanted is just to drink a cup of creamy foamy Cappuccino or my mind wouldn't function (As IT nerdy person i need to be calm) so going outside every time to get a cup is not feasible for me.

And here we go I bought a good starting espresso machine and during 1 month of practicing am doing a good progress by pulling creamy shots topping it with foamy milk and I couldn't be happier no more going outside, in fact i found making coffee is too much relaxing more than making a cup tea (I still love to drink tea). 

Thank you for reading my store here is a list below for who needs to know the major equipment i got.

You catch onto things quick. That's why we give you all the important stuff."" I was really really surprised by this because I honestly thought I was failing and fucking up all the time. But no, I'm apparently doing great. I tried to figure out why I was feeling this way and I realized.

Every time my parents talk to me about my job (it's usually me asking them questions) it's always in the veins of ""How do you not know this shit by now?"" or ""Just because they said that it doesn't mean anything, it doesn't mean they see you as special. They don't really think you're that smart, it's normal, you're not special."" My mom especially loves criticizing everything I do, telling me I must be fucking up at work everyday because I chew or sneeze too loud at the dinner table, the clothes i chose make me look fat and my stomach pop out and everyone's going to stare, my makeup looks like a clown, etc. Literally every time before I go out she stops and stares at my outfit and makeup and if it's not to her liking she makes me change.

Every single time I do anything for myself (buying myself a new cute water bottle, making my own drinks instead of buying them from Starbucks, trying out indie perfumes, putting a new charm on my bag, buying clothes I like) they're never happy and always insist I'm doing things wrong because I'm not doing things THEIR way (it's made of glass it's going to break easily why would you buy that, why would you go ahead and spend money to buy ingredients making the drinks you don't know what you're doing also stop drinking coffee every day, next time buy expensive mainstream perfumes because the only thing that matters is that they are a status symbol, that charm doesn't go with your bag it looks childish, you look fat in that). They want me to be this thing they can brag about to their other parents, they don't want me to try anything ""weird"" or ""childish"". I'm not even goth or anything I'm not trying out anything crazy I'm just an average girl who likes cute stuff. But no they want me to be this clean girl aesthetic daughter who only wears Gucci and eats salads every day.

This kind of diverged from my point but I'm just putting it all out there. I don't know I'm feeling a lot of things at work today.

How do I get him to chill?,"My 2.5 year old Great Pyr/Rottweiler/Aussie Twix is the most well behaved dog I‚Äôve ever met. People will often comment on how well-behaved he is and compliment me on his training- I have to tell them I can‚Äôt take any credit for that because he just came into the world as a good doggo. He stays with me on long off leash hikes, he responds to commands so beautifully 99% of the time, he plays gently with our cat, and I‚Äôve been able to leave him home alone since he was a 4 month old pup (uncrated- he was/is terrified of the crate) without him doing anything he wasn‚Äôt supposed to. He‚Äôs just a really well-behaved dog, and I had nothing to do with that ü§£

Twix and my 8 year old cat, Henry, have an adorable relationship- they play, chase birds and squirrels in our back yard together, and sleep together. Besides Twix‚Äôs crippling fear of loud noises, the only other ‚Äúproblem‚Äù I‚Äôve ever had with him is that he has appointed himself the chief officer of ‚Äúcat containment.‚Äù  It makes sense why he thinks we need him to play sheriff because that cat is a damn menace. We call him ‚Äúthe hall monitor‚Äù and ‚Äúfun ruiner.‚ÄùIf Henry has stolen another hair tie to play air hockey with in the hallway, Twix will 100% snitch on him every time. If Henry tries to get in a little counter surfing(which he knows damn well that he‚Äôs not supposed to do), Twix will let out 1 bark to tell me about it. If Henry hops onto the coffee table to steal water out of my glass, the hall monitor will growl at him a teeny bit until he gets down. 

At first, I thought that this little babysitter dynamic was hilarious, and I still kinda do. The issue I‚Äôm having is that Twix has started policing some of Henry‚Äôs seemingly benign behavior, like walking past his water bowl or going into the kitchen. I‚Äôm sure Twix has his reasons, but I‚Äôll be damned if I can‚Äôt figure out what they are. His dominant breed in Great Pyrenees, so I‚Äôm guessing that his tendencies to babysit are an expression of his livestock guarding genetics? That or he‚Äôs just a narc. How can I discourage this behavior without undermining his natural instincts to protect his home?

I‚Äôve tried a lot of different things, starting with the most simple of talking to her, working on deep breaths when we feel upset instead of hitting, removing ourselves from situations that make us feel upset, things like that, even tried time out to settle down for a few minutes.

I‚Äôm at a loss with what to do, I feel like I can‚Äôt be in the same room as my kid for more than 5 minutes without getting punched in the face then laughed at when I ask her to stop, this has obviously led me to feel less patient, and more generally upset throughout the day.

This all came to a head yesterday when we were at a playground and she asked for help getting out of a swing, then when I got her out, I got punched in the face and kicked in the chest because she asked for a lollipop and told her that running around with one in her mouth was not safe, and she‚Äôd have to wait until we left the park to eat it. I then snapped at her and yelled if you hit me one more time we‚Äôre leaving the park and going home. My wife then came and took over and I went and sat on a nearby rock wall until we left. Got home yesterday and after carrying her in since she fell asleep on the subway, I placed her on the couch and when she woke up I was not allowed to sit, if i tried I would get yelled at and told ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you near me‚Äù which is a new one. I left the room and went and spent like an hour in a different room in our apartment, then came back and helped with dinner/bedtime.

I don‚Äôt know how to make this stop, I feel terrible for how I reacted yesterday. She‚Äôs been in a major mommy mode lately and that‚Äôs fine, moms off for the summer, so is around a lot more right now than normal, but the constant violence towards me is really what‚Äôs getting to me, any advice on how to help her get past this behavior?

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of an acrylic sealer clear depends on several key features that dictate its performance and durability. These features determine its suitability for different applications and its ability to withstand various environmental conditions.

**Clarity and Finish:** The clarity of the acrylic sealer is paramount, as it should not distort or yellow the underlying surface. High-quality sealers offer a crystal-clear finish that enhances the natural beauty of the material without altering its color or texture. Additionally, the finish ‚Äì whether matte, satin, or gloss ‚Äì affects the final appearance and should be chosen based on the desired aesthetic.

A Premium acrylic sealer clear needs to remain transparent over time, even when exposed to prolonged sunlight or temperature changes. Its level of gloss needs to be appropriate for the request. High gloss is suitable for decorative items, but matte works better for a non-reflective finish for floors.

**UV Resistance:** Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can cause notable damage to surfaces, leading to fading, discoloration, and deterioration. Acrylic sealers with excellent UV resistance protect against these effects, ensuring that colors remain vibrant and the material's integrity is preserved. UV resistance is especially critically important for outdoor applications or items exposed to direct sunlight.

Exposure to UV light can cause the sealer to break down and become brittle over time.The better the UV resistance, the longer the sealer will last without needing to be reapplied. A good acrylic sealer clear should contain UV absorbers or stabilizers that block or minimize the damaging effects of UV rays.

**Water Resistance and Waterproofing:** A crucial function of acrylic sealer is to protect against moisture damage, preventing water penetration, mold growth, and warping. High-quality sealers offer remarkable water resistance, forming a barrier that repels water and withstands prolonged exposure to damp conditions. Some formulations may even provide waterproofing,creating an impermeable layer that completely blocks water intrusion.

Water-based sealers are generally water-resistant but may not be fully waterproof. Oil-based sealers tend to offer better waterproofing capabilities, but they may have other drawbacks such as higher VOC content. It is indeed critical to check the product specifications to determine the level of water protection offered.

**Adhesion and Flexibility:** The ability of the acrylic sealer to adhere strongly to the surface is critical for ensuring long-lasting protection. A sealer with good adhesion forms a strong bond with the substrate,preventing peeling,cracking,or flaking. Flexibility is also important, especially for surfaces that may expand or contract with temperature changes. A flexible sealer can accommodate these movements without compromising its integrity.

Acrylic sealers should be compatible with the specific material they are intended to protect. Some sealers are formulated for concrete, while others are designed for wood, metal, or other surfaces. Proper surface planning is also essential for ensuring good adhesion.

**Durability and abrasion Resistance:** Acrylic sealers should be durable enough to withstand daily wear and tear, including scratches, scuffs, and impacts. Formulations with high abrasion resistance are particularly important for high-traffic areas or surfaces that are frequently handled. Enhanced durability ensures that the sealer maintains its protective properties and aesthetic appeal over time.

Sealants can be reinforced with additives like silica or ceramic particles to improve their hardness and resistance to abrasion. The thickness of the sealer layer also contributes to its durability. Multiple thin coats generally provide better protection than a single thick coat.

**VOC Content and safety:** Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are chemicals released into the air as the sealer dries. High VOC levels can be harmful to human health and the environment. Low-VOC or VOC-free acrylic sealers are a healthier and more environmentally responsible choice.Checking the product's safety data sheet (SDS) can provide information on its VOC content and potential health hazards.

Water-based acrylic sealers tend to have lower VOC content than solvent-based sealers. Some manufacturers offer solvent-based sealers with reduced VOCs, but these may still require proper ventilation and safety precautions during application. It is indeed critically important to follow the manufacturer's instructions and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when using any acrylic sealer.

## Core Benefits

Using a high-quality acrylic sealer clear offers numerous benefits, enhancing the appearance and lifespan of various surfaces.These advantages make it a worthwhile investment for both DIY enthusiasts and professionals.

**Enhanced Aesthetics:** Acrylic sealers can enhance the natural beauty of surfaces, providing a glossy or matte finish that accentuates colors and textures. For example, applying a clear acrylic sealer to a painted mural can protect the colors from fading while adding a subtle sheen that makes the artwork more vibrant.

**Long-Term Protection:** Acrylic sealers provide a durable barrier against moisture, UV damage, and abrasion, extending the life of treated surfaces. This protection helps prevent cracking, peeling, and discoloration, which can maintain the original appearance. Regularly applying a clear acrylic sealer to a wooden deck, such as, will protect it from the elements and prevent it from rotting.

**Improved Cleanability:** Sealed surfaces are easier to clean and maintain, as the protective layer prevents dirt, grime, and stains from penetrating the material. If a coffee stain comes into contact with a sealed concrete countertop, the stain can be easily wiped away without leaving a mark. Regular cleaning can maintain the integrity and aesthetics.**Cost Efficiency:** While purchasing and applying acrylic sealer requires an initial investment, it can save you money in the long run by preventing costly repairs or replacements. Protecting your driveway with a clear acrylic sealant can avoid the need to repair cracks or replace it completely.

Compact yet boasting a series of useful features, it‚Äôs designed with efficiency and convenience in mind. Unlike larger, bulkier coffee makers, this slim unit comfortably fits on the most crowded of countertops without demanding too much space. Its user-focused design stands out immediately, and I can already see why it‚Äôs becoming a popular choice in kitchens, offices, and even RVs.

**Design and Ease of Use**  
Its sleek and minimalist profile makes it a deceptively simple gadget. Only four inches wide, it easily integrates into tight corners or small areas. I found this to be a lifesaver in the cluttered environment of my dorm room, where every bit of counter space is a premium. The coffee maker is equipped to accommodate a variety of mug sizes, a feature I tested extensively. Whether it‚Äôs my tall 7.3"" travel mug (without the drip tray) or my favorite smaller cup, the adjustable drip tray handled them all beautifully. Its lightweight structure also turned out to be a hit when I carried it with me on a camping trip.

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
Daily use has showcased just how practical and quick this coffee maker is. Supporting both 1.0 and 2.0 coffee pods‚Äîand the option to brew your own ground coffee using a reusable filter (not included)‚Äîthe versatility is impressive. With a one-touch brewing mechanism, all it takes is a single button press to have fresh coffee brewing. In less than two minutes, the maker reaches an ideal brewing temperature of 190¬∞F, delivering a hot cup of coffee just the way I like it. No more long waits during busy mornings! The auto shut-off feature was perfect for my forgetful tendencies‚Äîno worrying about accidentally leaving it on all day.

**Positives**
- Space-efficient with a slim 4-inch width  
- Compatible with multiple coffee pod systems and ground coffee  
- Adjustable drip tray to fit various mug sizes  
- Heats and brews coffee in under 2 minutes  
- Auto shut-off for energy efficiency  

**Negatives**  
- The reusable coffee filter is sold separately, which may be inconvenient for those who prefer ground coffee.  
- Not recommended for areas above 4,000 feet elevation due to performance limitations.  
- Regular descaling is necessary to prevent clogging, especially in areas with hard water.  

**Usability and Maintenance**  
One of the standout aspects is how easy it is to maintain. The coffee maker includes a removable drip tray and stainless-steel cover, making cleanup a quick and simple task. However, I noticed that proper care is required to maintain optimal functionality. Due to regional water differences, mineral deposits could affect performance, so the machine needs regular descaling every month or two (I‚Äôve been using white vinegar, which works just fine). The water reservoir‚Äôs 2-inch depth also makes refills straightforward.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to similar single-serve brewers like Keurig K-Mini or the Black+Decker single-cup coffee maker, this model holds its own in many aspects. The CHULUX brewer surpasses others in affordability and portability. While the Keurig offers a similar brew temperature and a slightly larger reservoir, its higher price point and bulkier design make it less appealing for compact spaces or tight budgets. Black+Decker's machine, though affordable, feels less durable in comparison. However, the inability to include a reusable coffee filter as part of the package gives competitors like Keurig a slight upper hand in the convenience category.

**Smart Spending**  
When evaluating the cost-efficiency of this coffee machine, it became evident that its price-to-quality ratio is compelling. For those on a budget or looking for affordable quality, the CHULUX CL-CM24002 strikes a balance between cost and practical features. While premium brands offer extra bells and whistles, the coffee maker handles all essential coffee-making tasks reliably without overspending on unnecessary extravagance. It won‚Äôt hurt your wallet, and it delivers coffee that tastes just as satisfying as pricier competitors.

1m32qo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1m32qo3/we_tested_wormhole_travel_but_lost_contact_with/,We Tested Wormhole Travel ‚Äì But Lost Contact with the Crew,"The human race breathed a sigh of relief when we finally colonized Mars. Years of overpopulation and resource shortages left our first planet stressed. Mars was seen as a pressure valve. A new planet for us to build up and eventually ruin. But we all knew it wasn‚Äôt a permanent solution. With the way our population grows, it would only give us a finite amount of time before we were in the same boat as before. We needed more planets. Planets that are farther away and host a greater abundance of resources.

To achieve this, humanity created a breakthrough. Using artificial gravity, we were able to bend space and create wormholes. This, in theory, would allow us to travel large distances instantaneously, spreading humanity throughout the cosmos.

After years of development, the first ever spacecraft with wormhole travel technology was developed. Initial unmanned tests were incredibly promising, and soon the first-ever manned wormhole trip was set to begin.

The ship, named the Rosen, was set out on a five-month voyage to travel from Earth to Mars. Once there, the crew of around 40 were set to activate the wormhole generator and travel back to Earth instantaneously. Everyone knew there were risks, but the developers and engineers were confident in their invention. The day came, and I remember staring at the monitor as the news reporter droned on about the historical president of the mission.

I drank my coffee from its pouch and watched as the countdown began. The camera changed to a split-screen satellite view of space. One half of the screen showed the Rosen sitting in orbit around Mars, and the second half was a view of space around Earth. When the countdown hit zero, the ship suddenly blinked between the two screens. In an instant, soundlessly, the massive ship traveled over 100 million miles.

While I heard the news reporter and people around her celebrating the massive achievement, I squinted my eyes at the screen, noticing the small details they didn‚Äôt. The ship had gone dark. The navigation lights seemed to have turned off as it passed through the wormhole. Furthermore, the engines looked cool, not emitting the normal blue glow that they normally do.

The automated door to my pod opened, and my coworker, Desmond, stuck his head in and grimaced.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna be needed up front,‚Äù Desmond said in his thick Irish accent.

I groaned and rolled out of the pod. Peering out the windows of the ship, I could see the Rosen sitting off in the distance. The ship sat in the same orbit of Earth as us, just as dark as it appeared on the screen. As I entered the command room of the ship. I could hear a loud rhythmic beeping coming from the communication panel. I could see Peter and Markus running remote diagnostics and communicating with our command team back on Earth.

‚ÄúGood to see you‚Äôre awake,‚Äù Peter chimed.

I yawned and nodded, gesturing to the control panel as it continued to loudly beep.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we're trying to figure out,‚Äù Markus said. ‚ÄúWhen the Rosen made the jump, it came out the other side blaring a distress signal. Despite the signal, we can‚Äôt reach the crew on coms for whatever reason. We called command, and they said the ship wasn‚Äôt distressed until it reached our side. And then there‚Äôs the ship going dark... Command is wondering if the jump didn‚Äôt have any unforeseen reaction with nuclear engines. Causing the blackout‚Ä¶ or some other electrical malfunction.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat ship has made how many unmanned jumps?‚Äù Desmond interrupted, ‚ÄúIt came out fine every other time. I‚Äôm telling ya, one of those pilots had a royal cock-up and caused this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, that doesn‚Äôt really matter now,‚Äù Peter said, taking off his communication headphones and walking away from the coms panel, ‚ÄúCommand told us to go in through the emergency airlock and provide assistance to the crew on getting the Rosen repaired. The sooner the better, they said.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck me,‚Äù Desmond said, throwing up his hands, ‚ÄúSo much for an easy paycheck.‚Äù

The ride over to the Rosen was incredibly short. I remember seeing the massive monolith of the ship towering over our small repair freighter. Despite the crew on board only numbering around 40, the ship itself was designed to support hundreds of passengers as well as their cargo. Our freighter shook violently as we docked into the airlock. Peter typed away on the panel by the large hatch, encrypting his keycard with the needed requirements to access restricted areas on the Rosen. The first set of doors opened, revealing the bright white interior of the airlock. The four of us stepped inside as the hatch behind us closed and the hatch into the Rosen opened.

The opening hallway of the Rosen was dark with the exception of small emergency lights illuminating the hallways and rooms.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think we‚Äôd be getting some kind of greeting,‚Äù Desmond muttered, ‚ÄúWe are saving their asses after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Peter said, clicking on his flashlight and looking at his map monitor on his wrist, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find someone and have them explain what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù

We traveled down the winding hallways of the massive ship, occasionally calling out but receiving no response. The eerie appearance of the empty ship began to settle on us. A palpable tension was building with every echoing footstep down the hall.

We rounded a corner to see a human figure standing at the end of the hallway. The figure was shrouded in the darkness that enveloped the whole ship, forbidding us from getting a good view.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Peter called out, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see another person on here. We were worried for a second.‚Äù

The figure didn‚Äôt move or speak, leaving us to sit in an awkward silence.

‚ÄúYou alright, sir?‚Äù Peter asked as he walked down the hallway.

I glanced over at Markus and Desmond, seeing the confused and worried expression that we were all sharing.

As Peter stepped closer, he was suddenly struck still as more of the man's features came into view of the light. He was completely naked and facing away from us. I felt my stomach churn at the sight of him. His entire body was covered in holes of all shapes and sizes. Some of the holes would slightly flex and wave like the muscles around them were contracting. He looked as though a corpse had been turned into a wasp nest. Inside each hole, I could see a small, white object that was surrounded by a fleshy red meat. As the light cast over his shoulder, the man slowly turned to face us, his face riddled with smaller holes.

‚ÄúHoly shit‚Ä¶‚Äù Desmond whispered as he stepped back.

The man‚Äôs eyes grew wide and wild as he began silently shambling towards us. Peter stretched out his arm and began backing away.

‚ÄúHey, man,‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sick, I‚Äôm gonna to need you to stand-‚Äù

Before he could finish, the man lunged forward headfirst, his arms flailing at his side as if he had no control over them. As he lunged, the holes in the man‚Äôs head produced deep, red tendrils. At the tips of each tendril were the white objects that I could now see were what looked like hooked porcupine quills. Peter dodged the incoming attack, and the man slammed onto the ground. Markus reared back to kick him, but Peter stopped him.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch him! Look!‚Äù Peter yelled, pointing to the holes on the man‚Äôs sides and back, now protruding those barbs.

Before an argument could be had, the man on the floor jumped to his feet and pounced on top of Desmond. We watched in horror as the tendrils shot from the man‚Äôs body and into Desmon‚Äôs flesh. Desmon screamed and attempted to push the man off of him, but it appeared the tendrils just pulled tighter and tighter. I watched as the tendrils would retract and shoot back out into Desmon‚Äôs skin, burrowing holes into his body. Peter and Markus stood back in shock and horror, not knowing what to do to get the man off of Desmon without being struck by the flailing barbs that rose from the man‚Äôs body.

Looking at the man, I noticed a detail I hadn‚Äôt seen before. Out of the man‚Äôs left leg, I noticed a long tendril that extended out of one of the holes and down the hall, rounding the corner. Without thinking, I dropped down to my hands and knees and grabbed hold of the long tendril.¬† It was warm and I could feel it pulsing in my hand, like a large vein. I tightened both hands around it and began pulling it apart. The vein flexed and stretched like a gummy worm before snapping with a sickening pop.

The man on Desmon suddenly flailed back, all of its tendrils retracting back into its body. The thing lurched to its feet; its arms still drooped at its sides. We prepared for another attack, but the man seemed to just walk aimlessly into the walls of the hallway, as though it was suddenly blind.

I was so focused on the man that I didn‚Äôt even notice Markus running up behind him. Markus raised up the large wrench he had retrieved from his tool pack and brought it down on the back of the man‚Äôs skull. The man fell to the ground, and Markus hit his head over and over. After a few hits, the man‚Äôs head was just a pile of mush, but his body was still struggling to get back up. I looked down to see Desmon bleeding profusely from his dozens of wounds. I knelt down beside him, but I knew there wasn‚Äôt anything I could do.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Peter mumbled under his breath.

I looked back to see six more people wandering down the hallway, all covered in holes.

‚ÄúWe need to get into a locked room, now,‚Äù Peter yelled, ‚ÄúGrab Desmond. Let‚Äôs go!‚Äù

Markus and I dropped to Desmond‚Äôs side, grabbing him by the shoulders and dragging him away from the approaching horde. Peter ran to the nearest room and placed his keycard on the scanner. The scanner dinged, and the door slid open.

We quickly pulled Desmon into the room, his screams of pain echoing down the hall and causing my ears to ring. Once on the inside, Peter used his keycard to shut the door, typing in a code on the scanner to activate the room's locking mechanism. I glanced around the room. Seeing that we had ended up in a large supply room. I quickly looked through the items at our disposal, searching for anything that could help Desmon‚Äôs injuries.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that, Peter?‚Äù Markus said, kneeling by Desmond.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Peter murmured under his breath. We could hear the hoard outside, slapping their bodies against the door.

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ Was that the crew?‚Äù Markus‚Äôs voice shook.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Markus!‚Äù Peter shouted as he hovered his hands over Desmond‚Äôs mutilated body. ‚ÄúSome of these holes got through the rib cage. We need something to stop the bleeding.‚Äù

Desmon had stopped screaming by now; perhaps he had gone into shock. I found a small first aid kit and began running to Desmon‚Äôs side. Looking back, I should have known it wouldn‚Äôt do much to help; his wounds were too extensive, but holding that little white box filled me with so much hope. I froze when I reached his side, his glossed-over eyes and pale skin staring at me. Desmon was already dead.

Before any of us could say a word, a new sound emanated from the door. A low buzzer sound followed by the metallic clicking of the locking mechanism. We slowly rose to our feet, a cold chill running down my spine as I recognized the sound.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Peter whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying codes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt getting it right,‚Äù Markus turned to Peter, ‚ÄúMaybe they don‚Äôt know the override code.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt sticking around to find out,‚Äù Peter announced, ‚ÄúGet the pry-bar out of your tool kit.‚Äù

Peter took the tool from Markus and went to the opposite side of the room. He pushed the contents off the shelves in order to climb up to the large air vent. While he worked, I looked around the storage room for anything I might use as a weapon, eventually finding a small tool bag that contained an average-sized pocketknife. It wouldn‚Äôt do much, but it was something.

Using the pry-bar, Peter popped of the opening to the ventilation shaft before calling us over. We filed into the ventilation shaft. It was cool, cramped, and dark in the vents. The floor and walls creaked and squealed as we shimmy through them.

Where are we going?‚Äù Markus asked.

Peter looked down at his wrist monitor and scrolled along the map of the ship.

‚ÄúThere might be an air vent near the airlock,‚Äù Peter replied, ‚ÄúWe can shimmy back and get into our ship. We‚Äôll call command and let them deal with this.‚Äù

The trek back went by quickly. Adrenaline was still pumping through us all. As we moved along the vent, I heard the distinct sound of the generator kicking on. The ship‚Äôs electrical power appeared to have been restored. We could see light shining through slats up ahead that Peter pointed out as the vent near the airlock. Once we reached the exit vent, Peter froze as he looked through the slats of the vent.

‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

I looked through the slats to see a mass of infected humans huddled around the airlock entrance. Their bodies riddled with the pulsing holes of the ones before.

‚ÄúWhy the fuck are they here?‚Äù Markus asked quietly.

‚ÄúThey must have known we‚Äôd come back,‚Äù Peter whispered, his brow furrowed as he watched them.

Without warning, Peter drew back his fist and punched the side of the ventilation shaft. The loud bang caused Markus and I to jump in fear.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù Markus whispered.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù Peter said plainly, pointing at the slats.

We looked out to see that the infected hadn‚Äôt moved, hadn‚Äôt reacted at all to the sudden loud noise.

""These vents make a lot of noise as we travel through the,"" Peter explained, his eyes narrowing, ""They would have heard us a while ago.""

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt they react?‚Äù Markus asked.

‚ÄúThe one we faced down the hall,‚Äù Peter replied, his voice no longer concealed in whispers, ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt react to us until the light flashed over its shoulder. Until there was a visual stimulus. I‚Ä¶ I think they‚Äôre deaf.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen how do you explain the horde coming down the hall once we started screaming?‚Äù Markus retorted.

‚ÄúMaybe they weren‚Äôt attracted by the sound. Maybe they have a way of communicating without talking.‚Äù

Peter‚Äôs finger slowly moved down the slats, pointing to the single large tendrils that extended out of each person and traveled down the hall in the same direction.

‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre right,‚Äù Markus continued, ‚Äúhow does that help us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù Peter answered, looking at his wrist monitor, ‚Äúbut we aren‚Äôt getting to the ship now. We need to make our way to the Rosen‚Äôs command center. We‚Äôll get communication back online and have Earth send help. Maybe we‚Äôll find someone who can give us some answers.‚Äù

We began working our way towards the command entrance of the ship. I could feel the shock of the situation wearing off, and a horrible dread setting in. I didn‚Äôt want to go further into the ship, I doubt any of us did, but what choice did we have?

We passed alongside one of the cramped engine rooms. I looked through the slats of the vent to see multiple infected people huddled in the room. Their grotesque bodies moved erratically against the machinery. Some seemed to be holding tools while others had their hands slapped onto monitors, their fingers snapping awkwardly as they appeared to type.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre they doing?‚Äù Markus asked.

We sat in silence for a long moment observing them before Peter‚Äôs shaky voice piped up.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to repair the ship.‚Äù

My eyes widened as I finally noticed what Peter had. It was rudimentary and wrong, like a child mimicking a mechanic, but he was right. They were trying to do maintenance.

‚ÄúHow is that possible?‚Äù Markus asked, ‚ÄúHow do they know to do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe they maintain some kind of memory,‚Äù Peter answered, ‚ÄúThey could be acting out repetitive actions. Same with trying the codes on the door, muscle memory.

‚ÄúWhy would they want to get the ship‚Äôs engines running?‚Äù Markus questioned, ‚ÄúWhere the hell do they plan to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ Maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter stopped himself.

I looked over at Peter. I could see his hands shaking. He was of team leader and was doing everything to maintain his composure, but I could see it on his face‚Ä¶ He was terrified.

‚ÄúWe need to make contact with command as soon as possible,‚Äù Peter whispered, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

We continued down the path. I followed Peter‚Äôs orders as he told me where to go at each fork in the vents. The map system on Peter‚Äôs wrist monitor didn‚Äôt show the ventilation tracks, but it allowed us a basic sense of direction when compared to the hallways and rooms we moved alongside. After a while, I could feel fatigue setting in. Crawling through the vents on my hands and knees was taking a toll on my body.

As we moved, the vents suddenly felt flimsy underneath me. Each movement was met with the metal plates flexing and buckling under our weight. A loud banging and creaking sound was let out with each advancement. We passed by a large set of slats that gave a great view of the outside area. I felt like my heart stopped as I looked out. We were suspended over a large mess hall. The chairs and tables had all been pushed out to the side, leaving the center of the room spacious and bare. There were many infected people in this room. They stood almost motionless, only giving a slight sway to each side.

They stood around a large object that was fastened in the center of the room. The thing in that room was a mass of horrible ruin. A large, viscous blob with large root-like extremities holding it to the floor. Its surface was a mix of deep red muscles, protruding bone, and hairy skin. Like the infected crew, the mass was covered in pulsing holes. Parts of the skin would expand and contract rhythmically, as though the mass was breathing. Off each rootlike structure sprouted hundreds of long red tendrils. Most were small and slowly writhed along the ground, but others were long, stretching out of the room completely. I looked at the people standing around the room, I could see a tendril attached to each of them. It extended out of their body and connected them to the mass.

Before any of us could say a word, we heard footsteps approaching from underneath us. We looked down to see two more infected people walking into the room. I heard Peter‚Äôs breath hitch as we saw them dragging Desmond‚Äôs lifeless body into the room.

Pulling him by his arms, the two infected held up his body before the mass. He had been stripped naked, and his injuries looked much more severe, appearing as though he had been mostly hollowed out. The smaller tendrils around the mass stood up and wiggled in the air as though they were being puppeted by a sick ventriloquist. We watched in horror as the tendrils grew in size and stretched out towards Desmond‚Äôs body, slithering into the holes. I felt sick as Desmond‚Äôs skin proceeded to deform and gyrate, like a blister stuffed with worms. The tendrils began breaking off of the mass and fully entering Desmond‚Äôs body. Our coworker‚Äôs corpse suddenly lurched back, his back bent to a point of almost breaking. His arms and legs erratically waved around, almost as though it was testing the body‚Äôs limits. I watched as a thicker tendril snaked its way out of Desmond‚Äôs leg and crawled along the floor before finally reuniting with the mass in the center of the room. Desmond‚Äôs body then turned and shambled underneath us, back in the direction he came.

We sat there in the vent, slack-jawed and pale. Some say there are things humans weren‚Äôt meant to see. I didn‚Äôt believe them until that moment.

‚ÄúL-let‚Äôs go‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter said before tapping my leg and pointing me forward.

I continued down the vent until the path made a sharp left turn. As I went around the corner, I stopped as I faced a tall metal wall.

The ventilation shaft extended upward about eight feet before continuing. I placed my back against the wall and began to pant. Peter shuffled up to where I was and looked up the shaft.

‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

¬†‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù Markus asked, ‚ÄúDo you think there is another way if we funnel back?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably not,‚Äù Peter answered while looking at his wrist monitor. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a small staircase up ahead that leads to the control room. The vents have to move up a level to reach it. We've got to get up there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Markus replied, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the game plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll lift you up,‚Äù Peter said as he looked at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the smallest of the three of us, so you‚Äôll go up first. After you‚Äôre up, Markus will lift me next. After I‚Äôm up top, I‚Äôll help pull Markus.‚Äù

Markus and I shared a glance. The metal floor beneath us creaked and groaned at every move. Could it really hold all that weight? Before we could protest, Peter‚Äôs words snapped our attention.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time to wait. Stand up, let's get this over with.‚Äù

I stood and looked up at the ledge. It looked so far away in that moment. Peter grabbed me around the legs and lifted me. The metal creaked loudly, and I threw my arms over the ledge. I expected to feel my weight give out from under me at any moment. That I would crash down on the violent mess below us. I held my breath and kicked up Peter‚Äôs body as I pulled myself up to safety. I turned back and looked over the edge, giving a shaky thumbs-up. Peter sighed and closed his eyes for a moment.

‚ÄúAlright, Markus, lift me up.‚Äù

Markus stood up in the shaft and looked up at the ledge where I was. He sighed before bending down and grabbing Peter by the legs. I scooted back and stared at the ledge. After a few moments, I began to see Peter rise above the ledge, his arms grabbing at the rim. I smiled at Peter for a moment before a loud metallic pop caused me to jump. Peter‚Äôs eyes widened, and I watched his form suddenly drop below the ledge with a large crash. I could hear Peter groaning as all I could see were his hands gripping the ledge.

I crawled over and grabbed his wrists, looking over the edge to see that the vent panel had collapsed under the weight of Peter and Markus. Markus lay on the ground, calling out in pain. I adjusted my grip on Peter‚Äôs arms and tried pulling him up. I then saw infected swarm over Markus, his pained screams echoing through the metal vents. I pulled up on Peter as hard as I could, but I couldn‚Äôt lift him on my own.

‚ÄúTake the keycard!‚Äù Peter yelled, his face grimacing in fear.

I hesitated for a moment.

‚ÄúDamnit! Take it!‚Äù he ordered.

I quickly released his arms and lifted the keycard off his neck.

‚ÄúThe wrist monitor too,‚Äù He groaned, sweat beading on his head.

I reached down and unbuckled the monitor from his arm.

‚ÄúGet to the command deck. Send help. Don‚Äôt look back. I‚Äôll try getting away.‚Äù

I nodded my head and turned back, scrambling quickly down the vent. I heard the metal hum as Peter released his grip, followed by a loud thud. I crawled as fast as I could, even as the sounds of Peter‚Äôs screams filled the vent.

I followed the map the best I could, winding back and forth through the ship. As I drew closer to the command center, the more my fear grew, despite its crampedness, I wasn‚Äôt in danger. What happens if I reach the command room and it‚Äôs filled with infected? I couldn‚Äôt go back. I would be out of options. As I began the final stretch to the control room, the vent began to shrink tighter. I had to lie on my stomach and shimmy along the tight corridor, the light coming from the slats being my only guidance forward.

As I reached the slats, I let out a shaky sigh of relief. There was only one infected person in the room. It faced away from me, looking out the front window of the Rosen, as though it were looking out towards Earth. I pulled out the pocketknife and shimmied it between the vent and the wall. Using it as a makeshift pry bar, I loosened the grate enough to force it off the wall with a hard shove. Even with the knowledge that the infected couldn‚Äôt hear, I still shuddered as the grate clattered against the floor behind the hole-ridden man.

I slid out of the vent and landed on my hands and knees. I stood to my feet, my back aching from the constant crawling, and walked over to the command room entrance. I looked down the hall to see it completely empty. It was just me and the one crewmate. And I had the element of surprise.

Without warning, the ship suddenly rattled and shook, and many of the monitors suddenly beeped and blinked. I was confused for a moment before the realization dawned on me‚Ä¶ It was the feeling of the engines coming to life. I looked down to see the long tendril trailing from the crewmate‚Äôs leg back towards the mass in the mess hall. The infected in the room seemed to notice the sudden shake as well. I watched as the man slowly turned away from the window to face me, his eyes lighting up when he saw me.

Seizing the moment, I reached down and grabbed the tendril, sliding my pocketknife underneath it and slicing the tendril in two. Immediately, the crewmate in the room began to convulse and thrash about in a confused manner. I ran up to the infected man, bringing my leg up and planting my foot hard into his hole-ridden chest. The man toppled back and landed on his back. ¬†He thrashed about in a feeble attempt to get up. Before he could get his bearings, I brought the heel of my foot down on the man‚Äôs shins repeatedly, continuing until I heard the bones in each leg snap.

Once I was sure the man was incapacitated, I ran to the communication monitor and began scrolling through to reach command on Earth. As I began work on establishing a connection, my eyes locked onto an anomaly on the monitor‚Ä¶ The date was wrong.

The date on the monitor read two weeks from that moment. Was it a bug? Some sort of electrical malfunction when the ship went through the wormhole? Then I saw the logs. Multiple entries, repair reports, and ration orders set over the two weeks that hadn‚Äôt happened yet. The second-to-last report was a captain‚Äôs order, detailing that the Rosen would be ‚Äúlanding on the surface to allow the engines to cool‚Äù. This made no sense to me at the time. The Rosen was designed to travel long periods through space. For the engines to overheat would require a long-running flight in an atmosphere. On top of that, what surface is the captain referring to that the ship was supposed to land on? The ship had been in outer space for the past five months

I opened the final log, a crew maintenance report. As my eyes scanned the document, a cold chill like deep space itself ran over me.

‚ÄúI have sabotaged the engines. I don‚Äôt have much time; they are testing codes on the door. It will repair the engines eventually, but it will take them time. At the very least, it might buy enough time for someone else to figure out a way to stop it. If you are reading this, it knows about Earth, it longs for it. If it reaches our planet, it will spread. You see what it has done to us. We cannot let it get to our home. I pray this final act is not in vain. I love you, Samantha. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt be there for you and Jack.‚Äù

My breath was shaky; I could feel beads of sweat forming on my face. The thing was repairing the ship so it could get to Earth.

As I stared dumbfounded at the monitor. I suddenly heard footsteps approaching from behind. A large horde of the infected crew was shambling down the hall towards the command room, their corpse-like eyes locked onto me. At the front of the horde shambled Peter and Markus. Their broken bodies a sick mockery of the men I once knew.

I ran to the hanger door and quickly swiped the keycard and input the emergency code on the door monitor, shutting the large door and sending the command room into lockdown protocol. I could hear them banging on the door as I ran to the navigation module. I didn‚Äôt have time to call for help. Once they were in this room, it wouldn‚Äôt take them long until they steered the ship straight into Earth. They might just burn up in the atmosphere, or land somewhere deep in the ocean, but I could stake the world on that chance.

I opened the navigation module, pulling up a small depiction of our solar system in real time. I found the coordinates and hastily plugged them into the wormhole navigation system. The monitor on the door began to beep. They were testing codes now.

The ship rattled, and I heard the wormhole generator hum to life. I looked out the window, a small blue rock in a near-infinite universe. It was my home. I felt fear and grief roll over me as I realized I would never see it again.

Suddenly, Earth was gone, as was space. The ship now hovered about a mile over a surface of beautiful chaos. A plane that appeared to stretch out infinitely in all directions. A land that shifted in constant, unrecognizable patterns. It is made up of colors that are both familiar and indescribable. In the mess, I could see forests, mountains, and oceans all made up of alien features. land masses folding in on themselves and becoming something entirely new.

Beyond it all was a face. The visage of this world‚Ä¶ this universe. It isn‚Äôt something easily describable. I couldn‚Äôt see it, but I could feel it so strongly that I might as well have been looking into its eyes. A being that both existed in this world and was at the same time, the world in its entirety. The being was so beautiful, but it caused my eyes to burn. They bled, and I had to look away from it. This was where they were. The folded space between our own.

I crouched down and hid myself from the gaze of the world. The banging on the door has stopped. I suppose it realized I had taken it back to its home. It knows it lost; there is no point in hunting me now.

I believe it has been about a day since I entered this folded space. That's what the date on the monitor says, at least. It feels as though it has been longer. I figured I would try sending my story through the command message system. I doubt the message will send, and even if it does, I have no way of knowing where or when it might appear. Time doesn‚Äôt seem to make any sense in this place. Hopefully, someone will read this and put an end to the Rosen travel project.

I have kept myself locked in the command room. I don‚Äôt know why. It isn‚Äôt like I‚Äôll find a way to make it out of this ship alive. I sealed my fate when I put in those coordinates. I might be better off feeding myself to that thing in the mess hall. I don‚Äôt know how long it will take for the wormhole to spit us out the other end. But part of me wants to try and stay alive long enough to see the end. To be there when the thing realizes there's no escape for it. To watch its surprise as it withers away in searing pain as the metal it's attached to melts against its putrid flesh. When the Rosen reaches its final destination, the surface of the sun.",3,1752846315.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

# The Silent Struggle of Digital Entrepreneurs

Sarah stared at her laptop screen at 2 AM, surrounded by empty coffee cups and crumpled notes. She'd been researching AI tool development for three months, trying to figure out how to turn her brilliant idea into reality. The concept was simple: a social media caption generator specifically for local restaurants. She knew it would sell, but the path from idea to execution felt like climbing Mount Everest in flip-flops.

Every tutorial she found assumed she already knew programming. Every platform she discovered required technical knowledge she didn't have. The few developers she contacted quoted $15,000 and six months for a basic version. By the time she factored in hosting, security, payment processing, and ongoing maintenance, her simple idea had become a $30,000 gamble with no guarantee of success.

Sound familiar? You're not alone.

Thousands of entrepreneurs sit on million-dollar AI tool ideas because the technical barriers feel insurmountable. They watch competitors launch successful products while their own concepts remain trapped in notebooks and voice memos. The frustration isn't just about money ‚Äì it's about knowing you could help people if only you could bridge the gap between vision and execution.

The traditional path to building AI tools requires you to become three different people: a programmer, a systems administrator, and a business operator. You need to understand API integrations, manage server infrastructure, handle security protocols, and set up payment systems. Most entrepreneurs give up before they even start.

This technical overwhelm creates a painful reality. You spend months learning instead of earning. You invest time in tutorials instead of talking to customers. You worry about code instead of focusing on what you do best ‚Äì identifying market needs and serving clients.

[Get AIWrappers Now](https://softtechhub.us/AIWrappers) and stop letting technical barriers hold back your best ideas.

# The Technical Nightmare: Why Building AI Tools Feels Impossible

Building AI tools from scratch is like trying to perform surgery with kitchen utensils. You might eventually succeed, but the learning curve is steep, the mistakes are expensive, and the results rarely match your vision.

The coding barrier alone stops most entrepreneurs cold. Learning Python, JavaScript, or any programming language takes months of dedicated study. Then you need to understand how to integrate different AI APIs, handle user authentication, manage databases, and create responsive interfaces. Each component requires specialized knowledge that takes weeks to master.

API integration presents another layer of complexity. You need to understand how OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and other AI services work. You must learn about rate limits, error handling, token counting, and cost management. One mistake in your API calls can result in unexpected charges or service interruptions that frustrate your users.

Server management adds another dimension of technical complexity. You need to choose between cloud providers, configure security settings, set up load balancing, and monitor performance. Server crashes happen at the worst possible moments, usually when you're sleeping or on vacation. The responsibility of keeping your tools running 24/7 becomes a constant source of stress.

Security vulnerabilities can destroy your reputation overnight. You need to protect API keys, sanitize user inputs, prevent SQL injection attacks, and comply with data protection regulations. A single security flaw can expose your users' information and land you in legal trouble.

The monetization maze presents its own challenges. Setting up payment processing with Stripe or PayPal requires technical integration and compliance knowledge. You need to handle subscription management, failed payments, refunds, and tax calculations. Building a secure checkout process takes weeks of development time.

User management systems add another layer of complexity. You need to create account registration, password reset functionality, usage tracking, and access control. Each feature requires careful planning and testing to avoid creating security holes or user experience problems.

The ongoing maintenance burden never ends. AI models update, security patches are released, and user feedback requires constant improvements. What starts as a simple tool becomes a full-time job that takes you away from growing your business.

This technical complexity explains why most entrepreneurs never move beyond the idea stage. They recognize the potential but get overwhelmed by the implementation requirements. The gap between vision and execution feels too wide to bridge without years of learning or significant financial investment.

# The Hidden Costs of Current Solutions

The true cost of building AI tools extends far beyond the initial development investment. Most entrepreneurs focus on the upfront expenses and miss the ongoing financial drain that slowly erodes their profit margins.

Time represents the largest hidden cost. The average entrepreneur spends 8-12 months learning the technical skills needed to build a basic AI tool. During this learning period, they're not serving clients, generating revenue, or growing their business. The opportunity cost of this time often exceeds $50,000 for established business owners.

Development costs multiply quickly when you account for all the moving parts. Basic hosting starts at $20 per month but scales rapidly as your user base grows. API costs for AI services can range from $100 to $1,000 monthly depending on usage. Security monitoring, backup services, and content delivery networks add another $50-200 monthly.

Professional development requires hiring specialists when you get stuck. Front-end developers charge $75-150 per hour, backend developers cost $100-200 per hour, and DevOps engineers command $150-300 per hour. A single complex feature can cost $5,000-15,000 to implement properly.

The learning curve for platforms that promise simplicity often proves deceptive. Tools like Bubble, Webflow, or custom WordPress solutions require significant time investment to master. The ""no-code"" label misleads many entrepreneurs into thinking they can build professional applications without technical knowledge.

Software licensing fees accumulate over time. Development tools, design software, project management platforms, and monitoring services each require monthly subscriptions. Professional developers typically spend $200-500 monthly on tools needed to build and maintain applications.

[Try AIWrappers Risk-Free](https://softtechhub.us/AIWrappers) with our 30-day money-back guarantee.

Quality assurance and testing represent another hidden expense. Professional applications require cross-browser testing, mobile responsiveness checks, security audits, and performance optimization. These testing phases can double your development timeline and costs.

The expertise gap forces many entrepreneurs to make expensive mistakes. Choosing the wrong database, implementing inefficient algorithms, or neglecting security best practices can require complete rebuilds later. These mistakes often cost more than hiring professionals from the beginning.

Platform limitations force expensive workarounds when you outgrow your initial choice. Moving from one platform to another requires rebuilding your entire application, migrating user data, and updating all integrations. This transition typically costs 50-100% of the original development budget.

# What the Market Really Needs

The AI tool market is hungry for a solution that eliminates technical barriers without sacrificing professional quality. Entrepreneurs need a platform that transforms ideas into revenue-generating applications instantly, without months of learning or expensive development costs.

Speed to market determines success in the AI tool space. The window of opportunity for specific AI applications often lasts only 6-12 months before competition saturates the market. Entrepreneurs need to move from concept to cash-generating tool within days, not months.

Professional appearance and functionality are non-negotiable. Your AI tools must look and perform like applications built by experienced development teams. Clients can immediately identify amateur-built tools and associate them with lower value and reliability.

Built-in monetization capabilities save months of development time. The ability to add payment processing, subscription management, and usage tracking with a few clicks eliminates the need for complex payment system integration. This feature alone can save $10,000-20,000 in development costs.

Reliable hosting and security must be handled automatically. Entrepreneurs want to focus on serving clients and growing their business, not managing servers and security updates. Professional-grade hosting with automatic scaling and security monitoring should be included without additional technical requirements.

The language barrier presents a massive opportunity that most tools ignore. The global AI tool market extends far beyond English-speaking countries. Tools that can accept input in multiple languages and generate outputs in the user's preferred language can access markets that competitors miss.

Client service requirements vary dramatically across industries and regions. Marketing agencies need tools that can be quickly customized for different client brands. Freelancers require tools that can be deployed under their own domain and branding. Business owners want tools that integrate seamlessly with their existing websites and workflows.

Whitelabel capabilities are essential for professional service providers. The ability to completely remove platform branding and replace it with your own creates a premium service offering. Clients pay significantly more for custom-branded tools that appear to be built specifically for their business.

Scalability without technical complexity appeals to growth-focused entrepreneurs. As your client base expands, your tools should handle increased traffic and usage automatically. The platform should scale seamlessly without requiring you to understand server configurations or database optimization.

# Real-World Applications and Success Stories

Marketing agencies have discovered that AIWrappers transforms their service offerings and client relationships. Instead of delivering one-time projects, they now provide ongoing value through custom AI tools that clients use daily.

Jennifer runs a digital marketing agency in Austin, Texas. She used to struggle with client retention because her deliverables were static ‚Äì once she delivered a marketing strategy or content calendar, the project was complete. Now she creates custom AI tools for each client: a social media caption generator for her restaurant clients, a product description writer for her e-commerce customers, and a blog post creator for her B2B clients.

These tools keep her clients engaged long after the initial project ends. They use her AI tools daily, associating her brand with ongoing value rather than one-time deliverables. Client retention has increased by 85%, and she can charge premium rates for what clients perceive as custom software development.

Freelance writers and content creators have found AIWrappers enables them to scale beyond hourly work. Instead of trading time for money, they create tools that generate revenue while they sleep.

Marcus, a freelance copywriter from Manchester, built a series of AI tools targeted at specific industries. His real estate ad copy generator serves property managers across the UK. His fitness program description writer helps personal trainers create compelling marketing copy. His restaurant menu description tool assists food service businesses with appealing item descriptions.

Each tool generates $500-2,000 monthly in passive income. Marcus now earns more from his AI tools than from his traditional freelance work, and he's built a business that doesn't depend on his constant availability.

Business owners have discovered that custom AI tools create competitive advantages that are difficult for competitors to replicate. Local businesses use these tools to improve customer service, generate leads, and streamline operations.

Dr. Sarah Kim, a dentist in Vancouver, created an AI tool that helps patients understand dental procedures and treatment options. Patients input their symptoms or concerns, and the tool provides educational information and suggests appropriate treatments. This tool has reduced the time she spends explaining basic procedures and has increased treatment acceptance rates by 40%.

International businesses have used AIWrappers to break into new markets without the expense of hiring local teams. The multilingual capabilities allow them to serve customers in their native languages, increasing conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

# The Profit Potential

AIWrappers users are generating revenue through multiple streams that compound over time. The platform enables both immediate income and long-term business growth through strategic tool development and deployment.

Direct tool sales represent the most straightforward revenue stream. Simple AI tools typically sell for $47-$197 as one-time purchases. More sophisticated tools with advanced features can command $297-$997. The key is positioning your tools as solutions to specific, expensive problems rather than generic utilities.

Subscription-based AI services generate recurring revenue that builds business value over time. Monthly subscriptions for specialized tools range from $29-$199 depending on the target market and value proposition. Annual subscriptions typically offer 20-30% discounts while improving cash flow and customer retention.

White-label licensing opportunities create high-margin revenue streams. You can license your tools to other entrepreneurs or agencies for $500-$5,000 per license, depending on the tool's sophistication and market demand. This model allows you to monetize your development work multiple times without additional effort.

Premium pricing strategies become viable when you solve expensive problems for specific niches. A tool that helps lawyers draft contracts faster can charge $500 monthly because it saves thousands in legal fees. A tool that helps real estate agents generate listing descriptions can charge $100 monthly because it saves hours of work.

The value proposition that justifies higher rates comes from understanding your audience's pain points and time constraints. Business owners will pay significantly more for tools that directly impact their bottom line or save substantial time compared to generic productivity tools.

Client retention through exclusive AI solutions creates predictable revenue and reduces marketing costs. When clients depend on your tools for daily operations, they're unlikely to switch to competitors. This dependency allows you to increase prices over time as the tools become more valuable to their business.

Building a portfolio of AI tools for different niches creates multiple revenue streams that reduce business risk. If one tool experiences declining demand, others can maintain your income while you develop new solutions. Successful AIWrappers users typically operate 5-10 tools across different markets.

The compound effect of multiple revenue streams accelerates business growth. Each new tool adds to your monthly recurring revenue while existing tools continue generating income. This compounding effect can create six-figure annual revenues within 12-18 months for dedicated entrepreneurs.

The AIWrappers creation process eliminates the complexity that stops most entrepreneurs from building AI tools. You can have your first monetizable application running within minutes of accessing the platform.

Step one involves clearly articulating your tool's purpose and target audience. Instead of saying ""I want a writing tool,"" specify ""I want a social media caption generator for local restaurants that creates engaging posts about daily specials and events."" This specificity helps the AI understand your requirements and generate more relevant outputs.

Step two focuses on customizing the interface and user experience. You can modify input fields, adjust output formatting, and customize the overall appearance to match your brand. The drag-and-drop editor makes these changes instantly without requiring technical knowledge or coding skills.

Step three involves deploying your tool and setting up monetization. You can choose between free hosting on an AIWrappers subdomain or connecting your own domain. Payment processing is configured through Stripe integration, allowing you to set pricing and start collecting revenue immediately.

Best practices for success include choosing profitable niches where people already pay for solutions. Instead of creating general-purpose tools, focus on specific industries or use cases where your tool solves expensive problems. Research your target market's pain points and price sensitivity before building.

Setting appropriate pricing strategies requires understanding your audience's budget and the value you provide. Start with lower prices to validate demand, then increase rates as you gather testimonials and case studies. Monitor usage patterns to identify opportunities for premium features or tiered pricing.

Marketing your AI tools effectively starts with identifying where your target audience spends time online. Create content that demonstrates your tool's value, collect email addresses from interested users, and use social proof to build credibility. Focus on benefits rather than features when describing your tools.

This option is ideal for serious entrepreneurs who want to maximize their tool-building capabilities from the start.

Bundle deal value extends beyond immediate savings. The complete package provides access to all future updates, new templates, and advanced features as they're released. This ensures your investment remains valuable as the platform evolves and improves.

Long-term value and ROI considerations make the bundle deal attractive for growth-focused entrepreneurs. The time saved by having immediate access to all features typically pays for the upgrade within the first month of use. The enhanced capabilities enable higher pricing and better client retention.

# Competitive Analysis: Why AIWrappers Wins

AIWrappers addresses critical gaps that existing platforms leave unfilled. While competitors focus on basic functionality, AIWrappers provides a complete solution for entrepreneurs who want to build professional AI tools without technical expertise.

Platforms like Lovable and [Bolt.new](http://Bolt.new) help create basic AI interfaces but lack the hosting, monetization, and scaling capabilities that entrepreneurs need. These platforms require you to handle deployment, payment processing, and ongoing maintenance separately, adding complexity and cost.

The hosting and monetization gaps in competitor platforms create additional expenses and technical requirements. You need to find hosting providers, configure payment systems, and manage security updates separately. These requirements often cost more than the original platform subscription.

Complexity barriers that other platforms create force entrepreneurs to become part-time developers. You need to understand hosting configurations, payment gateway integrations, and security protocols. AIWrappers eliminates these requirements by handling everything automatically.

Voice-to-app creation capabilities set AIWrappers apart from all competitors. No other platform allows you to simply describe your tool and receive a complete application instantly. This feature alone saves weeks of development time and eliminates the learning curve associated with traditional app builders.

Comprehensive AI model support gives AIWrappers users access to the latest and most powerful AI capabilities. While competitors limit you to specific models, AIWrappers supports GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Veo 3, and other cutting-edge systems. You can switch between models with one click to optimize performance and cost.

True whitelabel and monetization features are often missing from competitor platforms. AIWrappers provides complete branding control, custom domain support, and built-in payment processing. These features are essential for entrepreneurs who want to build professional businesses rather than hobby projects.

# Investment and ROI Analysis

The financial case for AIWrappers becomes clear when you compare the costs of alternative approaches to building AI tools. The platform's one-time investment typically pays for itself within the first month of use.

Traditional development costs for a single AI tool range from $15,000-$50,000 when hiring professional developers. This includes front-end design, back-end development, API integrations, payment processing, and hosting setup. Additional tools require similar investments, making this approach prohibitively expensive for most entrepreneurs.

Time savings represent the largest component of AIWrappers' value proposition. The platform eliminates 6-12 months of learning and development time, allowing you to focus on revenue generation instead of technical education. For established business owners, this time savings often exceeds $50,000 in opportunity cost.

Ongoing hosting and maintenance expenses add $200-$1,000 monthly for professionally built AI tools. AIWrappers includes enterprise-grade hosting, security monitoring, and automatic scaling at no additional cost. These savings alone justify the platform investment within the first year.

The opportunity cost of delay becomes significant in rapidly evolving markets. AI tool opportunities often have 6-12 month windows before competition intensifies. AIWrappers enables immediate market entry, allowing you to capture revenue while competitors are still in development phases.

Revenue potential varies based on your market focus and pricing strategy. Conservative estimates suggest most users can generate $1,000-$5,000 monthly revenue within 90 days of launching their first tools. Aggressive entrepreneurs focused on high-value niches often exceed $10,000 monthly within six months.

The money-back guarantee eliminates investment risk while providing confidence in the platform's value. The 30-day trial period allows you to build and test multiple tools before committing fully. This risk-free approach makes AIWrappers accessible to entrepreneurs with limited budgets.

[Get AIWrappers Bundle Deal](https://softtechhub.us/AIWrappers%20Bundle) for complete access to all features and templates.

Warning signs that AIWrappers might not be right for you include expecting passive income without effort. Building successful AI tools requires market research, customer acquisition, and ongoing optimization. The platform simplifies creation but doesn't eliminate the need for business development.

Users expecting overnight success without strategy often struggle with any business platform. AIWrappers provides the tools for success but requires strategic thinking about target markets, pricing, and positioning. Success depends on your ability to identify and serve customer needs.

People who prefer traditional development approaches might find AIWrappers too automated. If you enjoy coding and want complete control over every aspect of your applications, traditional development might better suit your preferences.

Realistic expectations for success include understanding that building a profitable AI tool business takes time and effort. Most successful users generate meaningful revenue within 90 days, but building a substantial business requires 6-12 months of consistent effort.

The effort required for profitable results includes market research, tool optimization, customer acquisition, and ongoing support. AIWrappers eliminates technical barriers but doesn't remove the need for business development and marketing activities.

1m32pip,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m32pip/noise_cancellation/,Noise Cancellation,"I loved to be around the wires. They were always reliable and never had to be recharged. The only issue with them was the wire‚Äôs life. If there was any problem, you had to buy another. But wired stuff was cheaper.

But for the first time, I tried Bluetooth earbuds ‚Äî noise-cancelling ones. I was very excited to use them.

I put the earbud in my ear and waited for the silence to cover me.

It was fabulous. I couldn‚Äôt hear a thing ‚Äî the fan, the washing machine ‚Äî nothing at all. It was just perfect for me. I started doing my office work while using the earbuds in my ears and maybe some songs in the background.

The office colleagues were tired of me and my new habit of listening to music while working because they literally had to walk to me to say something.

One morning, I woke up late and decided to work from home. Work from home is perfect, but the only issue is that there‚Äôs no login time and logoff time, no tea break or lunch break. You end up working the whole day and might get overwhelmed.

I was sitting on the chair, and my laptop was on the table in front of me. My room light bulb was just above me, giving me no shadows to get distracted.

I put the earbuds in my ears and started listening to music while working on the code.

There were many things on my desk ‚Äî my laptop, AC remote, my Iron Man figures, and some books. So basically, the whole desk was full. I loved playing with the Iron Man figures in between my work. They were kind of my stress busters.

While working, I felt a cold spot near my neck. I ignored it and continued working. But again, the same kind of cold spot hit my neck. I took the AC remote and turned it off.

After some time, the room began to feel warmer.  
The cold spots were gone.  
I glanced at the clock on my laptop screen ‚Äî it was a little past 10 PM.  
Time for dinner.

I made chapatis and some chickpeas for myself.  
When I walked into the kitchen, a strange, foul smell hit me.  
I covered my nose and looked around to find where it was coming from.  
Nothing.  
I sprayed some air freshener and took a deep breath.  
The smell was gone ‚Äî at least in the kitchen.

I looked at my plate. It was covered with another plate. I walked to it, the smell was in the air, and a smile on my face. I uncovered the plate.

It was empty.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I remember that I served my food.‚Äù

I looked around. I checked the fridge, I checked my oven, and everywhere else. But the food was nowhere.

‚ÄúDid I not cook today?‚Äù I asked myself. ‚ÄúMaybe I was too busy and just thought that I cooked?‚Äù

I shrugged off the thoughts and ordered food online.

The foul smell still covered the house. I had to spray the room freshener multiple times.

The sun rose again. It lit up my room. I slowly opened my eyes and grabbed my phone. The screen flashed the time. I was late again. So I decided to work from home once again.

The day went by with me listening to music and doing work. But because of a sudden lot of work pressure, I had to work till late night.

That day, again, I was working late. I had a cup of coffee to keep myself awake and avoid sleeping.

After some time, I walked to my chair. After a deep sigh, I descended into the seat. To my surprise, the armrest was already warm.

‚ÄúI left the chair a while ago‚Ä¶ It should be cold.‚Äù I looked at my AC; it was on. I unlocked the screen, letting the colors reflect in my eyes.

I put my earbuds back in my ears and played the loud music.

While my fingers were clicking on the keyboard, I again felt the cold spots. As before, I turned off the AC and waited for the warmth. But for some reason, my body turned warmer, yet my neck was still cold. A cold breeze kept touching my neck.

Without turning, I placed my hand on my neck. A chill ran down my spine. I felt breathing on my hand. It was like someone was standing there and breathing.

I took a deep breath and turned.

There was no one.

The whole room was empty.

I turned my head around to check for anyone hiding. But there was no one. I was all alone in my room ‚Äî I was alone at that moment only. Because there were muddy footprints on the floor. I followed them.

The footprints came into the house from the main door, which was locked from the inside. I always lock it. But the footprints came in and walked to my room. It seemed someone was standing behind me, and there were no footprints showing them leaving.

‚ÄúSomeone is in the house‚Ä¶‚Äù I said in a shaky voice.

I grabbed my phone, locked my bedroom from outside, and called the police.

‚ÄúWe are coming in 15 minutes. Please stay hidden,‚Äù they said.

I was standing in the hall. Without any protection. I didn‚Äôt know where to hide. I wasn‚Äôt even sure where that intruder was. He could be anywhere ‚Äî he could be in my bedroom, which I locked; he could be in the kitchen, bathroom ‚Äî anywhere.

I slowly kept walking towards the main door.

‚ÄúIf he is in the house, standing out in the public might be a good idea,‚Äù I thought.

I unlocked the door and stepped out. My hand was still holding the door knob, ready to close the door. I was facing outside, and my back was toward the house.

I heard someone rushing towards me ‚Äî someone was running.

Without looking, I closed the door and locked it from outside. Whoever was inside started knocking.

‚ÄúOpen the door and let me out\~‚Äù the voice came.

He wasn‚Äôt begging. He was not scared. He was humming while knocking on the door.

My teary eyes were fixed on the door. With my shaky breath, I walked back. I tried to be near the road as much as possible without getting knocked by the cars. I was ready to run if something happened.

The knocking continued.

I stood near the road, shaking. Suddenly, the knocking stopped. A shadow emerged near the window. Someone was walking towards the window. I prepared myself. Suddenly, the shadow stopped. It didn‚Äôt appear in front of the window but stayed there.

The police arrived.

I pointed toward the window and gave them the keys to my house. With guns in their hands, all five officers walked in.

I saw them separating into three groups ‚Äî one leading to the kitchen, another towards the bedroom, and the last one entering the living room. The shadow was still there, at the window. But the officers didn‚Äôt notice.

I walked into the house slowly. I turned toward the window.

There was a night lamp standing 5 feet 8 inches tall and casting a shadow on the wall behind it.

‚ÄúThe house is clear,‚Äù the officers said. After writing the report, they left.

I was standing alone in the house. Scared.

I went into the bedroom. The laptop was still on the desk with all my other stuff. I slowly sat on the chair, which again was warm. I was a bit confident because the officer confirmed that there was no one in the house.

I locked the doors and locked my bedroom door as well. I left the lights on while I decided to sleep. For a few hours, my eyes were wide open. I was unable to sleep.

After some time, my eyes decided to rest.

I closed my eyes, falling asleep. The fan kept blowing air. The blow was faster for some reason. I slept peacefully. I avoided thinking about anything and just let the airflow on my face.

The sunlight hit my eyes. I woke up. I grabbed my phone and checked the time. I was on time. But I decided to work from home once again. I left the bed and went to the washroom to get fresh.

After getting fresh, I returned to my bed and noticed some stains on my bed sheet. I looked closely ‚Äî they weren‚Äôt fresh. But they weren‚Äôt there the night before when I decided to sleep.

I pulled the bed sheet and put it in the washing machine.

I had to start work. I turned on my laptop and started working. After some time, when the whole house was echoing with the washing machine‚Äôs sound and the noise of vehicles from outside, I decided to put the earbuds in my ears again.

In the infinite silence, I kept on working. The sun was still in the sky. I was staring at the laptop screen, going through the report.

The cold spot hit my neck once again. With my eyes still on the laptop, I picked up the AC remote and clicked the ‚Äúturn on/off‚Äù button. The AC gave out a small jingle. My eyes shifted toward it. The sound was of the AC turning on.

My jaw dropped. I was still feeling cold blows on my neck. With a shivering body, I slowly turned back. The cold blow faded. There was nothing behind me.

I returned to my laptop. My eyes were on the screen, but my brain was still trying to process it. My hands were still trembling. I started scrolling through the report while still thinking about the cold spots.

I felt them again ‚Äî this time on my neck and shoulder. I looked up toward the AC ‚Äî it was on. I tried to ignore the cold air and continued my work.

After some time, because of continuous earbud use, my ears started aching. I decided to take them out for a while. My hands moved toward my ears, passing through the cold air blowing on my neck, and I slowly took out the earbuds.

My body froze in shock. I wanted to scream, but I couldn‚Äôt. I wanted to run, but my body didn‚Äôt move. Without the earbuds, I could hear the breathing behind me. Someone was near my right ear, breathing hard.

My heart started racing.

Two cold hands touched my hands from behind and guided them to put the earbuds back into my ears.

I jumped from my seat and turned back.

The cold blow stopped. There were many footprints on the floor. This time, they were leaving my room. I gathered my courage and slowly followed them.

The footprints were all over the house, followed by a severe foul smell. I closed my nose with one hand and clenched a fist with the other, prepared for anything.

The footprints ended at the main door again.  
That day someone entered the house.  
And now, someone left the house.

I stood there, staring at the footprints.  
Cold air brushed the back of my neck.  
I could hear someone breathing behind me.  
The earbuds were still in my ears ‚Äî noise cancellation was off.  
And then, without me touching them‚Ä¶  
It turned on.  
Silence.  
Total silence.  
But the breath‚Ä¶  
it was still there.",2,1752846237.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1m32oql,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1m32oql/we_tested_wormhole_travel_but_lost_contact_with/,We Tested Wormhole Travel ‚Äì But Lost Contact with the Crew,"The human race breathed a sigh of relief when we finally colonized Mars. Years of overpopulation and resource shortages left our first planet stressed. Mars was seen as a pressure valve. A new planet for us to build up and eventually ruin. But we all knew it wasn‚Äôt a permanent solution. With the way our population grows, it would only give us a finite amount of time before we were in the same boat as before. We needed more planets. Planets that are farther away and host a greater abundance of resources.

To achieve this, humanity created a breakthrough. Using artificial gravity, we were able to bend space and create wormholes. This, in theory, would allow us to travel large distances instantaneously, spreading humanity throughout the cosmos.

After years of development, the first ever spacecraft with wormhole travel technology was developed. Initial unmanned tests were incredibly promising, and soon the first-ever manned wormhole trip was set to begin.

The ship, named the Rosen, was set out on a five-month voyage to travel from Earth to Mars. Once there, the crew of around 40 were set to activate the wormhole generator and travel back to Earth instantaneously. Everyone knew there were risks, but the developers and engineers were confident in their invention. The day came, and I remember staring at the monitor as the news reporter droned on about the historical president of the mission.

I drank my coffee from its pouch and watched as the countdown began. The camera changed to a split-screen satellite view of space. One half of the screen showed the Rosen sitting in orbit around Mars, and the second half was a view of space around Earth. When the countdown hit zero, the ship suddenly blinked between the two screens. In an instant, soundlessly, the massive ship traveled over 100 million miles.

While I heard the news reporter and people around her celebrating the massive achievement, I squinted my eyes at the screen, noticing the small details they didn‚Äôt. The ship had gone dark. The navigation lights seemed to have turned off as it passed through the wormhole. Furthermore, the engines looked cool, not emitting the normal blue glow that they normally do.

The automated door to my pod opened, and my coworker, Desmond, stuck his head in and grimaced.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna be needed up front,‚Äù Desmond said in his thick Irish accent.

I groaned and rolled out of the pod. Peering out the windows of the ship, I could see the Rosen sitting off in the distance. The ship sat in the same orbit of Earth as us, just as dark as it appeared on the screen. As I entered the command room of the ship. I could hear a loud rhythmic beeping coming from the communication panel. I could see Peter and Markus running remote diagnostics and communicating with our command team back on Earth.

‚ÄúGood to see you‚Äôre awake,‚Äù Peter chimed.

I yawned and nodded, gesturing to the control panel as it continued to loudly beep.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we're trying to figure out,‚Äù Markus said. ‚ÄúWhen the Rosen made the jump, it came out the other side blaring a distress signal. Despite the signal, we can‚Äôt reach the crew on coms for whatever reason. We called command, and they said the ship wasn‚Äôt distressed until it reached our side. And then there‚Äôs the ship going dark... Command is wondering if the jump didn‚Äôt have any unforeseen reaction with nuclear engines. Causing the blackout‚Ä¶ or some other electrical malfunction.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat ship has made how many unmanned jumps?‚Äù Desmond interrupted, ‚ÄúIt came out fine every other time. I‚Äôm telling ya, one of those pilots had a royal cock-up and caused this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, that doesn‚Äôt really matter now,‚Äù Peter said, taking off his communication headphones and walking away from the coms panel, ‚ÄúCommand told us to go in through the emergency airlock and provide assistance to the crew on getting the Rosen repaired. The sooner the better, they said.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck me,‚Äù Desmond said, throwing up his hands, ‚ÄúSo much for an easy paycheck.‚Äù

The ride over to the Rosen was incredibly short. I remember seeing the massive monolith of the ship towering over our small repair freighter. Despite the crew on board only numbering around 40, the ship itself was designed to support hundreds of passengers as well as their cargo. Our freighter shook violently as we docked into the airlock. Peter typed away on the panel by the large hatch, encrypting his keycard with the needed requirements to access restricted areas on the Rosen. The first set of doors opened, revealing the bright white interior of the airlock. The four of us stepped inside as the hatch behind us closed and the hatch into the Rosen opened.

The opening hallway of the Rosen was dark with the exception of small emergency lights illuminating the hallways and rooms.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think we‚Äôd be getting some kind of greeting,‚Äù Desmond muttered, ‚ÄúWe are saving their asses after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Peter said, clicking on his flashlight and looking at his map monitor on his wrist, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find someone and have them explain what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù

We traveled down the winding hallways of the massive ship, occasionally calling out but receiving no response. The eerie appearance of the empty ship began to settle on us. A palpable tension was building with every echoing footstep down the hall.

We rounded a corner to see a human figure standing at the end of the hallway. The figure was shrouded in the darkness that enveloped the whole ship, forbidding us from getting a good view.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Peter called out, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see another person on here. We were worried for a second.‚Äù

The figure didn‚Äôt move or speak, leaving us to sit in an awkward silence.

‚ÄúYou alright, sir?‚Äù Peter asked as he walked down the hallway.

I glanced over at Markus and Desmond, seeing the confused and worried expression that we were all sharing.

As Peter stepped closer, he was suddenly struck still as more of the man's features came into view of the light. He was completely naked and facing away from us. I felt my stomach churn at the sight of him. His entire body was covered in holes of all shapes and sizes. Some of the holes would slightly flex and wave like the muscles around them were contracting. He looked as though a corpse had been turned into a wasp nest. Inside each hole, I could see a small, white object that was surrounded by a fleshy red meat. As the light cast over his shoulder, the man slowly turned to face us, his face riddled with smaller holes.

‚ÄúHoly shit‚Ä¶‚Äù Desmond whispered as he stepped back.

The man‚Äôs eyes grew wide and wild as he began silently shambling towards us. Peter stretched out his arm and began backing away.

‚ÄúHey, man,‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sick, I‚Äôm gonna to need you to stand-‚Äù

Before he could finish, the man lunged forward headfirst, his arms flailing at his side as if he had no control over them. As he lunged, the holes in the man‚Äôs head produced deep, red tendrils. At the tips of each tendril were the white objects that I could now see were what looked like hooked porcupine quills. Peter dodged the incoming attack, and the man slammed onto the ground. Markus reared back to kick him, but Peter stopped him.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch him! Look!‚Äù Peter yelled, pointing to the holes on the man‚Äôs sides and back, now protruding those barbs.

Before an argument could be had, the man on the floor jumped to his feet and pounced on top of Desmond. We watched in horror as the tendrils shot from the man‚Äôs body and into Desmon‚Äôs flesh. Desmon screamed and attempted to push the man off of him, but it appeared the tendrils just pulled tighter and tighter. I watched as the tendrils would retract and shoot back out into Desmon‚Äôs skin, burrowing holes into his body. Peter and Markus stood back in shock and horror, not knowing what to do to get the man off of Desmon without being struck by the flailing barbs that rose from the man‚Äôs body.

Looking at the man, I noticed a detail I hadn‚Äôt seen before. Out of the man‚Äôs left leg, I noticed a long tendril that extended out of one of the holes and down the hall, rounding the corner. Without thinking, I dropped down to my hands and knees and grabbed hold of the long tendril.¬† It was warm and I could feel it pulsing in my hand, like a large vein. I tightened both hands around it and began pulling it apart. The vein flexed and stretched like a gummy worm before snapping with a sickening pop.

The man on Desmon suddenly flailed back, all of its tendrils retracting back into its body. The thing lurched to its feet; its arms still drooped at its sides. We prepared for another attack, but the man seemed to just walk aimlessly into the walls of the hallway, as though it was suddenly blind.

I was so focused on the man that I didn‚Äôt even notice Markus running up behind him. Markus raised up the large wrench he had retrieved from his tool pack and brought it down on the back of the man‚Äôs skull. The man fell to the ground, and Markus hit his head over and over. After a few hits, the man‚Äôs head was just a pile of mush, but his body was still struggling to get back up. I looked down to see Desmon bleeding profusely from his dozens of wounds. I knelt down beside him, but I knew there wasn‚Äôt anything I could do.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Peter mumbled under his breath.

I looked back to see six more people wandering down the hallway, all covered in holes.

‚ÄúWe need to get into a locked room, now,‚Äù Peter yelled, ‚ÄúGrab Desmond. Let‚Äôs go!‚Äù

Markus and I dropped to Desmond‚Äôs side, grabbing him by the shoulders and dragging him away from the approaching horde. Peter ran to the nearest room and placed his keycard on the scanner. The scanner dinged, and the door slid open.

We quickly pulled Desmon into the room, his screams of pain echoing down the hall and causing my ears to ring. Once on the inside, Peter used his keycard to shut the door, typing in a code on the scanner to activate the room's locking mechanism. I glanced around the room. Seeing that we had ended up in a large supply room. I quickly looked through the items at our disposal, searching for anything that could help Desmon‚Äôs injuries.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that, Peter?‚Äù Markus said, kneeling by Desmond.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Peter murmured under his breath. We could hear the hoard outside, slapping their bodies against the door.

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ Was that the crew?‚Äù Markus‚Äôs voice shook.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Markus!‚Äù Peter shouted as he hovered his hands over Desmond‚Äôs mutilated body. ‚ÄúSome of these holes got through the rib cage. We need something to stop the bleeding.‚Äù

Desmon had stopped screaming by now; perhaps he had gone into shock. I found a small first aid kit and began running to Desmon‚Äôs side. Looking back, I should have known it wouldn‚Äôt do much to help; his wounds were too extensive, but holding that little white box filled me with so much hope. I froze when I reached his side, his glossed-over eyes and pale skin staring at me. Desmon was already dead.

Before any of us could say a word, a new sound emanated from the door. A low buzzer sound followed by the metallic clicking of the locking mechanism. We slowly rose to our feet, a cold chill running down my spine as I recognized the sound.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Peter whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying codes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt getting it right,‚Äù Markus turned to Peter, ‚ÄúMaybe they don‚Äôt know the override code.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt sticking around to find out,‚Äù Peter announced, ‚ÄúGet the pry-bar out of your tool kit.‚Äù

Peter took the tool from Markus and went to the opposite side of the room. He pushed the contents off the shelves in order to climb up to the large air vent. While he worked, I looked around the storage room for anything I might use as a weapon, eventually finding a small tool bag that contained an average-sized pocketknife. It wouldn‚Äôt do much, but it was something.

Using the pry-bar, Peter popped of the opening to the ventilation shaft before calling us over. We filed into the ventilation shaft. It was cool, cramped, and dark in the vents. The floor and walls creaked and squealed as we shimmy through them.

Where are we going?‚Äù Markus asked.

Peter looked down at his wrist monitor and scrolled along the map of the ship.

‚ÄúThere might be an air vent near the airlock,‚Äù Peter replied, ‚ÄúWe can shimmy back and get into our ship. We‚Äôll call command and let them deal with this.‚Äù

The trek back went by quickly. Adrenaline was still pumping through us all. As we moved along the vent, I heard the distinct sound of the generator kicking on. The ship‚Äôs electrical power appeared to have been restored. We could see light shining through slats up ahead that Peter pointed out as the vent near the airlock. Once we reached the exit vent, Peter froze as he looked through the slats of the vent.

‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

I looked through the slats to see a mass of infected humans huddled around the airlock entrance. Their bodies riddled with the pulsing holes of the ones before.

‚ÄúWhy the fuck are they here?‚Äù Markus asked quietly.

‚ÄúThey must have known we‚Äôd come back,‚Äù Peter whispered, his brow furrowed as he watched them.

Without warning, Peter drew back his fist and punched the side of the ventilation shaft. The loud bang caused Markus and I to jump in fear.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù Markus whispered.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù Peter said plainly, pointing at the slats.

We looked out to see that the infected hadn‚Äôt moved, hadn‚Äôt reacted at all to the sudden loud noise.

""These vents make a lot of noise as we travel through the,"" Peter explained, his eyes narrowing, ""They would have heard us a while ago.""

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt they react?‚Äù Markus asked.

‚ÄúThe one we faced down the hall,‚Äù Peter replied, his voice no longer concealed in whispers, ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt react to us until the light flashed over its shoulder. Until there was a visual stimulus. I‚Ä¶ I think they‚Äôre deaf.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen how do you explain the horde coming down the hall once we started screaming?‚Äù Markus retorted.

‚ÄúMaybe they weren‚Äôt attracted by the sound. Maybe they have a way of communicating without talking.‚Äù

Peter‚Äôs finger slowly moved down the slats, pointing to the single large tendrils that extended out of each person and traveled down the hall in the same direction.

‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre right,‚Äù Markus continued, ‚Äúhow does that help us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù Peter answered, looking at his wrist monitor, ‚Äúbut we aren‚Äôt getting to the ship now. We need to make our way to the Rosen‚Äôs command center. We‚Äôll get communication back online and have Earth send help. Maybe we‚Äôll find someone who can give us some answers.‚Äù

We began working our way towards the command entrance of the ship. I could feel the shock of the situation wearing off, and a horrible dread setting in. I didn‚Äôt want to go further into the ship, I doubt any of us did, but what choice did we have?

We passed alongside one of the cramped engine rooms. I looked through the slats of the vent to see multiple infected people huddled in the room. Their grotesque bodies moved erratically against the machinery. Some seemed to be holding tools while others had their hands slapped onto monitors, their fingers snapping awkwardly as they appeared to type.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre they doing?‚Äù Markus asked.

We sat in silence for a long moment observing them before Peter‚Äôs shaky voice piped up.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to repair the ship.‚Äù

My eyes widened as I finally noticed what Peter had. It was rudimentary and wrong, like a child mimicking a mechanic, but he was right. They were trying to do maintenance.

‚ÄúHow is that possible?‚Äù Markus asked, ‚ÄúHow do they know to do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe they maintain some kind of memory,‚Äù Peter answered, ‚ÄúThey could be acting out repetitive actions. Same with trying the codes on the door, muscle memory.

‚ÄúWhy would they want to get the ship‚Äôs engines running?‚Äù Markus questioned, ‚ÄúWhere the hell do they plan to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ Maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter stopped himself.

I looked over at Peter. I could see his hands shaking. He was of team leader and was doing everything to maintain his composure, but I could see it on his face‚Ä¶ He was terrified.

‚ÄúWe need to make contact with command as soon as possible,‚Äù Peter whispered, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

We continued down the path. I followed Peter‚Äôs orders as he told me where to go at each fork in the vents. The map system on Peter‚Äôs wrist monitor didn‚Äôt show the ventilation tracks, but it allowed us a basic sense of direction when compared to the hallways and rooms we moved alongside. After a while, I could feel fatigue setting in. Crawling through the vents on my hands and knees was taking a toll on my body.

As we moved, the vents suddenly felt flimsy underneath me. Each movement was met with the metal plates flexing and buckling under our weight. A loud banging and creaking sound was let out with each advancement. We passed by a large set of slats that gave a great view of the outside area. I felt like my heart stopped as I looked out. We were suspended over a large mess hall. The chairs and tables had all been pushed out to the side, leaving the center of the room spacious and bare. There were many infected people in this room. They stood almost motionless, only giving a slight sway to each side.

They stood around a large object that was fastened in the center of the room. The thing in that room was a mass of horrible ruin. A large, viscous blob with large root-like extremities holding it to the floor. Its surface was a mix of deep red muscles, protruding bone, and hairy skin. Like the infected crew, the mass was covered in pulsing holes. Parts of the skin would expand and contract rhythmically, as though the mass was breathing. Off each rootlike structure sprouted hundreds of long red tendrils. Most were small and slowly writhed along the ground, but others were long, stretching out of the room completely. I looked at the people standing around the room, I could see a tendril attached to each of them. It extended out of their body and connected them to the mass.

Before any of us could say a word, we heard footsteps approaching from underneath us. We looked down to see two more infected people walking into the room. I heard Peter‚Äôs breath hitch as we saw them dragging Desmond‚Äôs lifeless body into the room.

Pulling him by his arms, the two infected held up his body before the mass. He had been stripped naked, and his injuries looked much more severe, appearing as though he had been mostly hollowed out. The smaller tendrils around the mass stood up and wiggled in the air as though they were being puppeted by a sick ventriloquist. We watched in horror as the tendrils grew in size and stretched out towards Desmond‚Äôs body, slithering into the holes. I felt sick as Desmond‚Äôs skin proceeded to deform and gyrate, like a blister stuffed with worms. The tendrils began breaking off of the mass and fully entering Desmond‚Äôs body. Our coworker‚Äôs corpse suddenly lurched back, his back bent to a point of almost breaking. His arms and legs erratically waved around, almost as though it was testing the body‚Äôs limits. I watched as a thicker tendril snaked its way out of Desmond‚Äôs leg and crawled along the floor before finally reuniting with the mass in the center of the room. Desmond‚Äôs body then turned and shambled underneath us, back in the direction he came.

We sat there in the vent, slack-jawed and pale. Some say there are things humans weren‚Äôt meant to see. I didn‚Äôt believe them until that moment.

‚ÄúL-let‚Äôs go‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter said before tapping my leg and pointing me forward.

I continued down the vent until the path made a sharp left turn. As I went around the corner, I stopped as I faced a tall metal wall.

The ventilation shaft extended upward about eight feet before continuing. I placed my back against the wall and began to pant. Peter shuffled up to where I was and looked up the shaft.

‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

¬†‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù Markus asked, ‚ÄúDo you think there is another way if we funnel back?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably not,‚Äù Peter answered while looking at his wrist monitor. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a small staircase up ahead that leads to the control room. The vents have to move up a level to reach it. We've got to get up there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Markus replied, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the game plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll lift you up,‚Äù Peter said as he looked at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the smallest of the three of us, so you‚Äôll go up first. After you‚Äôre up, Markus will lift me next. After I‚Äôm up top, I‚Äôll help pull Markus.‚Äù

Markus and I shared a glance. The metal floor beneath us creaked and groaned at every move. Could it really hold all that weight? Before we could protest, Peter‚Äôs words snapped our attention.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time to wait. Stand up, let's get this over with.‚Äù

I stood and looked up at the ledge. It looked so far away in that moment. Peter grabbed me around the legs and lifted me. The metal creaked loudly, and I threw my arms over the ledge. I expected to feel my weight give out from under me at any moment. That I would crash down on the violent mess below us. I held my breath and kicked up Peter‚Äôs body as I pulled myself up to safety. I turned back and looked over the edge, giving a shaky thumbs-up. Peter sighed and closed his eyes for a moment.

‚ÄúAlright, Markus, lift me up.‚Äù

Markus stood up in the shaft and looked up at the ledge where I was. He sighed before bending down and grabbing Peter by the legs. I scooted back and stared at the ledge. After a few moments, I began to see Peter rise above the ledge, his arms grabbing at the rim. I smiled at Peter for a moment before a loud metallic pop caused me to jump. Peter‚Äôs eyes widened, and I watched his form suddenly drop below the ledge with a large crash. I could hear Peter groaning as all I could see were his hands gripping the ledge.

I crawled over and grabbed his wrists, looking over the edge to see that the vent panel had collapsed under the weight of Peter and Markus. Markus lay on the ground, calling out in pain. I adjusted my grip on Peter‚Äôs arms and tried pulling him up. I then saw infected swarm over Markus, his pained screams echoing through the metal vents. I pulled up on Peter as hard as I could, but I couldn‚Äôt lift him on my own.

‚ÄúTake the keycard!‚Äù Peter yelled, his face grimacing in fear.

I hesitated for a moment.

‚ÄúDamnit! Take it!‚Äù he ordered.

I quickly released his arms and lifted the keycard off his neck.

‚ÄúThe wrist monitor too,‚Äù He groaned, sweat beading on his head.

I reached down and unbuckled the monitor from his arm.

‚ÄúGet to the command deck. Send help. Don‚Äôt look back. I‚Äôll try getting away.‚Äù

I nodded my head and turned back, scrambling quickly down the vent. I heard the metal hum as Peter released his grip, followed by a loud thud. I crawled as fast as I could, even as the sounds of Peter‚Äôs screams filled the vent.

I followed the map the best I could, winding back and forth through the ship. As I drew closer to the command center, the more my fear grew, despite its crampedness, I wasn‚Äôt in danger. What happens if I reach the command room and it‚Äôs filled with infected? I couldn‚Äôt go back. I would be out of options. As I began the final stretch to the control room, the vent began to shrink tighter. I had to lie on my stomach and shimmy along the tight corridor, the light coming from the slats being my only guidance forward.

As I reached the slats, I let out a shaky sigh of relief. There was only one infected person in the room. It faced away from me, looking out the front window of the Rosen, as though it were looking out towards Earth. I pulled out the pocketknife and shimmied it between the vent and the wall. Using it as a makeshift pry bar, I loosened the grate enough to force it off the wall with a hard shove. Even with the knowledge that the infected couldn‚Äôt hear, I still shuddered as the grate clattered against the floor behind the hole-ridden man.

I slid out of the vent and landed on my hands and knees. I stood to my feet, my back aching from the constant crawling, and walked over to the command room entrance. I looked down the hall to see it completely empty. It was just me and the one crewmate. And I had the element of surprise.

Without warning, the ship suddenly rattled and shook, and many of the monitors suddenly beeped and blinked. I was confused for a moment before the realization dawned on me‚Ä¶ It was the feeling of the engines coming to life. I looked down to see the long tendril trailing from the crewmate‚Äôs leg back towards the mass in the mess hall. The infected in the room seemed to notice the sudden shake as well. I watched as the man slowly turned away from the window to face me, his eyes lighting up when he saw me.

Seizing the moment, I reached down and grabbed the tendril, sliding my pocketknife underneath it and slicing the tendril in two. Immediately, the crewmate in the room began to convulse and thrash about in a confused manner. I ran up to the infected man, bringing my leg up and planting my foot hard into his hole-ridden chest. The man toppled back and landed on his back. ¬†He thrashed about in a feeble attempt to get up. Before he could get his bearings, I brought the heel of my foot down on the man‚Äôs shins repeatedly, continuing until I heard the bones in each leg snap.

Once I was sure the man was incapacitated, I ran to the communication monitor and began scrolling through to reach command on Earth. As I began work on establishing a connection, my eyes locked onto an anomaly on the monitor‚Ä¶ The date was wrong.

The date on the monitor read two weeks from that moment. Was it a bug? Some sort of electrical malfunction when the ship went through the wormhole? Then I saw the logs. Multiple entries, repair reports, and ration orders set over the two weeks that hadn‚Äôt happened yet. The second-to-last report was a captain‚Äôs order, detailing that the Rosen would be ‚Äúlanding on the surface to allow the engines to cool‚Äù. This made no sense to me at the time. The Rosen was designed to travel long periods through space. For the engines to overheat would require a long-running flight in an atmosphere. On top of that, what surface is the captain referring to that the ship was supposed to land on? The ship had been in outer space for the past five months

I opened the final log, a crew maintenance report. As my eyes scanned the document, a cold chill like deep space itself ran over me.

‚ÄúI have sabotaged the engines. I don‚Äôt have much time; they are testing codes on the door. It will repair the engines eventually, but it will take them time. At the very least, it might buy enough time for someone else to figure out a way to stop it. If you are reading this, it knows about Earth, it longs for it. If it reaches our planet, it will spread. You see what it has done to us. We cannot let it get to our home. I pray this final act is not in vain. I love you, Samantha. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt be there for you and Jack.‚Äù

My breath was shaky; I could feel beads of sweat forming on my face. The thing was repairing the ship so it could get to Earth.

As I stared dumbfounded at the monitor. I suddenly heard footsteps approaching from behind. A large horde of the infected crew was shambling down the hall towards the command room, their corpse-like eyes locked onto me. At the front of the horde shambled Peter and Markus. Their broken bodies a sick mockery of the men I once knew.

I ran to the hanger door and quickly swiped the keycard and input the emergency code on the door monitor, shutting the large door and sending the command room into lockdown protocol. I could hear them banging on the door as I ran to the navigation module. I didn‚Äôt have time to call for help. Once they were in this room, it wouldn‚Äôt take them long until they steered the ship straight into Earth. They might just burn up in the atmosphere, or land somewhere deep in the ocean, but I could stake the world on that chance.

I opened the navigation module, pulling up a small depiction of our solar system in real time. I found the coordinates and hastily plugged them into the wormhole navigation system. The monitor on the door began to beep. They were testing codes now.

The ship rattled, and I heard the wormhole generator hum to life. I looked out the window, a small blue rock in a near-infinite universe. It was my home. I felt fear and grief roll over me as I realized I would never see it again.

Suddenly, Earth was gone, as was space. The ship now hovered about a mile over a surface of beautiful chaos. A plane that appeared to stretch out infinitely in all directions. A land that shifted in constant, unrecognizable patterns. It is made up of colors that are both familiar and indescribable. In the mess, I could see forests, mountains, and oceans all made up of alien features. land masses folding in on themselves and becoming something entirely new.

Beyond it all was a face. The visage of this world‚Ä¶ this universe. It isn‚Äôt something easily describable. I couldn‚Äôt see it, but I could feel it so strongly that I might as well have been looking into its eyes. A being that both existed in this world and was at the same time, the world in its entirety. The being was so beautiful, but it caused my eyes to burn. They bled, and I had to look away from it. This was where they were. The folded space between our own.

I crouched down and hid myself from the gaze of the world. The banging on the door has stopped. I suppose it realized I had taken it back to its home. It knows it lost; there is no point in hunting me now.

I believe it has been about a day since I entered this folded space. That's what the date on the monitor says, at least. It feels as though it has been longer. I figured I would try sending my story through the command message system. I doubt the message will send, and even if it does, I have no way of knowing where or when it might appear. Time doesn‚Äôt seem to make any sense in this place. Hopefully, someone will read this and put an end to the Rosen travel project.

I have kept myself locked in the command room. I don‚Äôt know why. It isn‚Äôt like I‚Äôll find a way to make it out of this ship alive. I sealed my fate when I put in those coordinates. I might be better off feeding myself to that thing in the mess hall. I don‚Äôt know how long it will take for the wormhole to spit us out the other end. But part of me wants to try and stay alive long enough to see the end. To be there when the thing realizes there's no escape for it. To watch its surprise as it withers away in searing pain as the metal it's attached to melts against its putrid flesh. When the Rosen reaches its final destination, the surface of the sun.",1,1752846184.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

1m32lsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m32lsa/explore_the_szhetefu_french_press_coffee_maker_is/,Explore the SZHETEFU French Press Coffee Maker: Is It Worth the Hype?,"**Compact and Functional Design**  
Having tested the SZHETEFU 12ozFP-01 and its practicality, I immediately noticed its sleek, compact design. The matte silver finish combined with its lightweight and portable build makes it a perfect candidate for both kitchen use and outdoor escapades. At first, I used it as my early morning coffee companion, sitting on my counter next to my overly complicated espresso machine. The French press not only looked elegant but also proved sturdier than one might expect for its size, thanks to its double-layered stainless steel construction. This durability gives me peace of mind when tossing it into a camping bag or even when my clumsy friend accidentally knocked it over.  

**Improved Brewing Mechanism**  
What‚Äôs striking about this particular French press is the enhanced stopper design. It hugs the stainless steel interior tightly, reducing any rogue coffee grounds escaping into the brew. After battling with poorly filtered coffee in past French presses, this improvement stood out. The brewing process felt seamless, and cleanup was surprisingly simple. With the threaded rod already secured, it eliminated the annoying task of post-use disassembly‚Äîanyone who has dealt with fiddly setups knows how much of a win this is.

**Rich Coffee Flavor Retained**  
The real win comes when tasting the coffee. This French press excels in achieving full immersion during the brewing process, leading to a cup of coffee with a smooth texture and a depth of flavor that‚Äôs tough to rival. I tested the versatility by experimenting with different coffee bean flavors and grind settings‚Äîit accommodated them all quite well. There‚Äôs something immensely satisfying about being able to adjust the brewing ratio to match my mood on a given morning. My sister, who is an occasional espresso drinker, found that this device made robust and flavorful espresso-like coffee with minimal effort.  

**Perks**  
- Durable, double-layer insulation that keeps coffee warm for an impressive hour or two.  
- Lightweight and highly portable, making it ideal for travel or outdoor adventures.  
- Modern design that minimizes coffee ground residue in the final brew.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Limited to 12 ounces, which might not be enough for multiple drinkers at once.  
- The absence of measurement marks inside the container can make brewing accuracy tricky for beginners.  

**Versatile Usage and Style**  
One of the biggest reasons I fell for this French press was how versatile it proved to be during my tests. Its 12-ounce capacity felt just right whether I used it to control coffee consumption throughout the day or brewed a quick cup while camping. The polished matte body didn‚Äôt tarnish or pick up fingerprints, ensuring it stayed elegant on any surface. Plus, being manual in operation, it didn‚Äôt need batteries or electricity‚Äîa lifesaver on a hiking trip when I was desperate for caffeine.  

**Market Rivals**  
Compared to similar mini French presses such as those by AeroPress or Bodum, this product carves its niche in rugged portability and durability. While the AeroPress is lauded for its unique brewing method, it lacks the thermal retention offered by SZHETEFU‚Äôs double-walled design. On the other hand, Bodum‚Äôs aesthetic and larger capacity may win over family settings, but they are prone to denting with less-than-careful handling. For someone looking for a durable, travel-friendly option, this stainless steel option takes the edge over its peers.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
For the features it offers, this French press falls square in the category of ""smart spending."" Its build and filter efficiency justify the price, especially for those who prioritize single-serve brewing. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest French press on the market, that extra bit spent on quality is noticeable with each use. The portability, robust materials, and ease of cleaning make it a worthwhile contender for anyone who prepares coffee on the go.

1m32ki0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m32ki0/how_long_do_we_settle_in_to_living_together_30f/,"How long do we settle in to living together? (30F, 31M)","My fiance (31M) and I(30F) moved in together a few weeks ago. 

For some background- he's never lived with a partner, or even a roommate aside from his own mother. I've lived with a partner before but that ended after a month of living together (DV situation)

We've been together for 3 years and the past few weeks have just been....different?

We're both (supposedly) clean people,  like i knew he left cups on his night stand, but otherwise clean. 

I don't know if its just adjusting or if it's the overwhelming amount of stuff to unpack(literally) or what.

We talked about division of things- like that if he cooks, I clean the dishes, if I cook, he cleans the dishes. He takes out the trash, I deal with laundry. He takes care of his cat, I take care of my dog, etc. 

So far- I have done 100% of the grocery shopping. Cooked 100% of dinners. Packed his lunch for work every day. 100% of the laundry. 50% of breakfasts. (He makes himself breakfast before work 3-4 days a week, I make breakfast for both of us the other days. If I go out into the livingroom while he's making breakfast, he makes it for me too- but like today- I stayed in bed for 15 extra minutes because I stayed up a few hours later than he did. Walked out, he only made himself breakfast but still had expectations for me to make his lunch)

He's taken my dog out twice- I got stuck at work and she whined at him, the other time was his day off and I was working. But I've been feeding his cat twice a day, I don't think he's cleaned the litter box (I'm allergic to something in kitty litter so I don't go near it, but he hasn't even taken the bag of litter into the room the box is in) 

I occasionally leave some laundry on the floor.... but only if I take something off before getting in bed, or while I'm drying off after a shower- I pick up any laundry in the morning. Him? Theres a mountain of laundry on the closet floor (large walk in- cant even walk into it because its about a foot deep with clothes both clean and dirty, all his). Pile of laundry in the bathroom- if I don't pick it up, it just stays there. Heck, there's a random collection of dirty shirts on the side of the couch he sits on. 

When he gets home from work, he leaves his lunch box in a random place, usually with something left behind in it (one day, he didnt have time to eat at work. So turkey sandwhich got left out in there all night) 

He goes through so. Much. Toilet. Paper. I get that he has IBS but it's a full roll every day and a half, which he doesn't change. He leaves the empty roll even though there's a trash can *right under it* 

I'm the only one who's cleaned the coffee maker- every single day. (Only one of us drinks coffee, and it's not me)

He took out trash once, otherwise it's all been me even though he makes most of the trash. 

When he cooks, I clean dishes. When I cook, the dishes sit in the sink until they annoy me. The 2 times he's done dishes, I have to re-wash them because there's still food on them. 

I'm 100% unpacked. Him? He works 5 days a week, too tired after work, but on his days off? Those are his days off. 

We agreed to use his furniture because it fit the apartment better than mine would have (size), it took 2 weeks to finally get him to at least help go through all the drawers to make space for my clothes in the dresser- there's 15 drawers.... it turned into 5 bags of trash(that sat in the bedroom for 2 days before I got annoyed at tripping over them and took them out) 

I just....

I'm so exhausted. I work, I come home, I clean, I cook.... I clean more. I stay up late doing laundry (for reference, my clothes take up 3 drawers. His take up the other 12 AND the entire closet. The laundry is all just load after load of laundry from the closet. Plus trying to make a dent in the mountain of blankets. Plus his 3 changes of clothes per day- he puts clothes on to make breakfast, throws them in the mountain, changes for work, then when he gets home from work he changes again) 

He works, he comes home, he spends an hour in the bathroom, he sits down to watch TV, he eats, leaves his plate on the couch(because the table is covered in his stuff) and then plays video games. Maybe makes himself a bowl of ice-cream that gets left somewhere random when he's done. 

I work 70-80 hours a week,  he works 45 (but still earns more). I just keep finding myself thinking ""I wanna go home"" but this is home, it just doesn't feel like it. ",1,1752845879.0,relationship_advice,4,0.67,False

If you don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs basically making fun of a guy who does ‚Äúhipster‚Äù or ‚Äúartsy‚Äù stuff I guess. Likes reading books in a coffee shop or in the park, likes to dress in trendy fashion, listens to music which is niche, girl centred or non-mainstream, plays a guitar, that kind of shit. 

It started off as a joke making fun of legitimate performative and fake people who are doing it, essentially just to get laid but now, it feels like every guy who does anything like I mentioned or slightly adjacent is a performative male, and cringy. 

Fuck off. Look, maybe I‚Äôm only offended cause I like this stuff.

We lived in Panama for many years, and during that time we fell in love with the country‚Äôs incredible coffee culture, not just the famous Geisha, but also beautiful varieties like Typica, Catuai, Caturra and small-lot blends from dedicated producers.

We recently launched ***Red Field Coffee Roaster***, and our first release is a Sample Kit that includes 5 distinct Panamanian coffees (18g each):

* Geisha Natural
* Typica 
* Catuai Washed
* Catuai Natural
* Caturra

The goal is to create a beautiful and intentional tasting experience, something that feels special from the first look to the last sip.

This is still a very early-stage, self-funded passion project, we‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on the coffees, the design, or the idea in general. Happy to answer questions, or learn from this awesome community.

It's not as old as Astoria falls, but it is the first ever No sleep I ever wrote Also I would say maybe a small trigger warning for some of the more gruesome language used.)



I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy, but I know what I saw and I know that if I just tell someone, anyone, then I‚Äôll know that what I saw wasn‚Äôt my imagination but in fact real.

For some background, me and my wife, Juliet, had first met as teenagers although we did not get together until we were both twenty. We had shared one science lesson when we were fifteen and did not speak to one another until our Senior prom and only began regularly conversing when we discovered we were going to attend the same college that none of our separate group of friends were going to. I wasn‚Äôt the best at science, to be honest, people would tell me it was common sense and I would just shrug and continue reading whatever novel I had picked up at the school library. Juliet, however, oh how she loved science. Every time I would come to her dorm, she would be studying every aspect of science she could get her hands on: plant life, toxins, genetics, she wanted to learn it all. After college, we both applied for university, her for science and me for history. In our second year, I proposed, and we got married a few months later in a small ceremony in her grandparent‚Äôs back garden.¬†

It was the happiest day of my life, I still get teary eyed when I remember it. No part of my mind in that moment would believe how our lives turned out only a decade later.

It began five years ago, when my wife returned from a trip she had taken alongside some co-workers to a research base in the Eastern Antarctic plateau in Antarctica. When she had first told me about the trip, I was hesitant. Sure, she had taken trips out of the country before, going to places like Norway or Iceland, but she had never gone so far as Antarctica. To be completely honest, it frightened me. Who wouldn‚Äôt be afraid of their wife of ten years going to a frozen tundra where the only message you‚Äôll get, if any, would be a shaky sentence that you could barely understand? But I didn‚Äôt worry too much, my wife knew what she was doing and she would be back with me soon.¬†

Ice was her career, afterall, she was a glaciologist, which I didn‚Äôt even know was a real career until she told me about it. I was happy for her, and I was just glad that my measly salary as a history teacher at a local high school wouldn‚Äôt have to be stretched every month so we could survive.

The research trip ended up taking over a month before my wife and her team were taken out of the cold and brought back home. I picked up from the airport, expecting to finally get a warm hug back from her, but instead I got the cold shoulder as she made her way to the passenger seat and closed the door after herself. I shrugged off any feelings of doubt or worry, assuming it had been a difficult month for her or she was maybe jet lagged and wanted to be left alone.¬†

Instead of seeing the signs, I got into the driver‚Äôs seat, and silently drove us home.

The drive was awkward, Juliet just kept staring out the window and my small talk didn‚Äôt even attempt to begin until I could see our house that we were fast approaching.

‚ÄúSo, how was the trip?‚Äù I carefully asked, hoping for just one word from her instead of the silent treatment.¬†

She didn‚Äôt even bother to look over at me.

‚ÄúWas Mark there? I think I saw his son at the airport, he‚Äôs grown hasn‚Äôt he?‚Äù Still no answer. Normally Juliet loved to tell me all the details about her trips and her team, even late at night when I‚Äôm just trying to sleep. I thought about pushing my luck and directly asking her to face me but decided against it. Instead, I pulled into our driveway, watching as Juliet exited first and closed the door after herself, leaving me alone and isolated in the car.¬†

I think that was when the pit began to bloom in my stomach, I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what was going on but I still knew that I had to do something about it before it continued.

That night, I prepared a relaxing evening that consisted of layers of blankets, warm soup and Juliet‚Äôs favourite show. A new season had begun airing during her month away and I knew she would want to catch up before she returned to work and possibly get spoiled by her co-workers who stayed in the office rather than field work. I didn‚Äôt really like the show myself, I thought the acting was a bit clunky and some plots were too unbelievable to be accepted even by the most open minded, but I didn‚Äôt mind if it meant I could spend some quality time with my wife. After preparing the soup, a nice vegetarian dish as Juliet hadn‚Äôt eaten meat since a bad experience she had as a teenager, I invited her down to my den of blankets, encouraging her to sit down while I handed her one of the warm bowls. Juliet barely acknowledged me, going under at least three layers of the blankets and taking the bowl, staring blankly at the still dark tv. I sat down next to her, placing an arm around her shoulder before putting the first episode of the new season on for her.¬†

Juliet still didn‚Äôt react to any of this. Normally, she would tell me the relationships of every character, where I had seen their actors before and who she could not stand. But she didn‚Äôt, she sat silently, the once warm bowl in her hands losing its steam along the two hours we spent watching up until the most recent episode.¬†

‚ÄúSo, what did you think?‚Äù I asked, but, as I expected, she did not answer me. She just offered the bowl back to me and sat motionless. Sighing, I took our bowls and made my way to the kitchen, feeling a bit annoyed about the waste of food but just being glad that she was at least interacting with me, even if it was at a small scale.¬†

By the time I had finished clearing up, Juliet was asleep on the sofa, fully enclosed in her slumber despite the fact that the kitchen light was still shining brightly in her direction.¬†

I told myself that she was probably tired, because to me, that was the most logical explanation. I had work tomorrow so I left her there, making sure she had enough blankets covering her as I checked all the doors and windows, turned every light off downstairs, and made my way to our bedroom. Despite knowing she was safe, when I made it to my bed, something didn‚Äôt feel right. The bed felt colder than normal, maybe I was just imagining it, but knowing my wife was downstairs rather than with me after a month apart felt difficult to accept.

Still, I tried my best, turning off my bedroom light and going to sleep for the night.

At two in the morning, hours after I had gone to bed and hours before I would have to start getting ready for work, I could hear a strange wet sound coming from downstairs.¬†

Getting my slippers on, I made my way down the stairs. I followed the sound of squishing until I could hear the humming of the fridge and see its faint light.¬†

The silhouette of Juliet was visible as soon as I turned the corner, I could see her forearms and hands moving but her back covered her actions.

‚ÄúJuliet?‚Äù I called out, but once more she did not answer. The sound of squelching only intensified but now I could hear not only the moist sounds of her fingers digging into something, I could hear her teeth as they chomped down and chewed like a dog gnawing on a bone.

Slowly, I placed a hand on Juliet‚Äôs shoulder, moving her towards me as I could finally see what she was doing.

Juliet‚Äôs fingers were deep into a container of mince, condensation dripping off the plastic and forming a puddle at her feet. Her lips and the area surrounding them were covered in a mix of blood and juices that had been composed of the other items that sat alongside the mince and on top of it as well. A small chunk of mince laid in the middle of her lips as she slurped it up and licked her lips, maintaining eye contact as her fingers dug back into the container to grab another moist handful of beef.¬†

To be completely honest, I froze up when I saw her standing there with the mince. I had forgotten it was even in the fridge in the first place. Normally, I would barely have any meat in the fridge or freezer, but after a week long trip to Greenland a few months before, I had brought some mince that I could have while she was gone. However, I had gone overboard in the amount I had brought and instead, a lot of it was left forgotten in the very back of our fridge. I didn‚Äôt even know that Juliet had known about it, let alone would have wanted to eat it. I felt worry begin to eat into me as I grabbed the tray of mince out of her hands, placing it down on the side and touching the back of her neck. As I rubbed the back of her neck, for a split second, I thought I felt something slithering across my fingers.

I wasn‚Äôt sure what it was, but it moved at such a speed that I just chalked it up to my tired state and I was just imagining things again. What I wasn‚Äôt imagining however, was how Juliet reacted.

Juliet‚Äôs hands grabbed my wrists, pushing me towards the stairs and glaring not at me, but just above me. Releasing my hands, Juliet‚Äôs arm pointed up the stairs and she just glared for what felt like hours but was really, just a few seconds. Her eyes looked darker than normal and I felt a chill when the back of the first step hit into my ankle. But she didn‚Äôt say anything, just pointing.

Deciding to not argue, I went back upstairs and went to bed.

When my alarm blared in the morning, I just shrugged as I got dressed, telling myself it was just a dream as I put my socks on and went downstairs.

Juliet was already awake, sitting at the kitchen table and eating a slice of toast that looked like it was lightly buttered. The mince that I had left on the kitchen side was gone and I don‚Äôt know why, but I felt relieved because even if it was real, at least the evidence of it wasn‚Äôt waiting for me in the morning.

Upon me coming down, Juliet‚Äôs face lightened up as she stood up, wrapping her arms around me and shoving her face onto my shoulder.¬†

I let out a light chuckle, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. Any worries I had once had were now gone and I could finally focus on the day I had ahead of me.

‚ÄúDo you have a shift today?‚Äù I asked her. I honestly hadn‚Äôt expected much of a response so I was plentifully surprised when I got one.

‚ÄúNope, I think I‚Äôm just going to rest some more today.‚Äù My smile brightened warmly as I placed a short kiss on her lips and I got my work shoes on, leaving with a final wave to Juliet. I know some may judge me for this, but for the rest of the day at work, I couldn‚Äôt wait to get home. I thought that maybe yesterday had been some mistake or just an off day, my gullible mind did not come from one of naivety, but one of hope and love. Love for my marriage and an everlasting love for my wife.¬†

My Juliet.¬†¬†

When I returned home, I came with a stack of tests that needed to be marked and graded, an almost empty coffee cup that was ice cold and a single rose I had gotten from a small market on my way home. Normally, I didn‚Äôt get Juliet flowers, she would often tell me there was no need where she would not be at home long enough to water them and it was a waste to spend money on something which decays. A part of me had somewhat agreed, but I still wanted to buy her at least one rose if she was going to be at home for at least a week.¬†

When I got home and fished my keys out of my pocket, my attempt to unlock the door was cut short when the front door immediately opened from my fingers grazing the wood.¬†

The pit inside bloomed once more.

Pushing the door open, I scanned the house for any sign of a burglary or an attack, anything that suggested an intruder had been inside.

But there was nothing.

Everything was where I had left it, the only thing that was really missing was Juliet. At first, I thought maybe she had left and forgotten to lock the door but that didn‚Äôt sound right, not only because she would have told me if she was going out, but her keys were still on the side where they had been for the last month. I thought maybe she meant to leave them but that didn‚Äôt sound like Juliet, even if she had kept the door unlocked on purpose, there would have still been a part of her that would have grabbed the keys out of impulse or as an assurance after the fact.

‚ÄúJuliet?‚Äù I called out, hearing the sound of the bathroom sink turn on at an increased speed, the fact I could hear it so clearly made me realise that it must have been on quite a high setting. Against my better judgement, I rushed up the stairs and opened the bathroom door, a cloud of steam attacking me as soon as the barrier of the door was removed. Waving the steam away, I had finally made it to the source.

Juliet, her hands over the scalding hot water, her forehead dripping with sweat and her eyes rolling into the back of her head.

I acted as fast as I could once the shock had worn off, turning the water off as I grabbed a cloth and wrapped her hands up. Her fingers were completely red and I could see areas in her palms where the skin had begun to blister, separating from her flesh in a hue of yellow and red. I felt sick but I ignored it as we exited the bathroom, taking her downstairs and going towards the door. At that moment, my worries were reignited and any peace that had been given to my mind was gone, I needed to get her to a hospital.¬†

Juliet didn‚Äôt say much during this, her eyes were glazed over and sometimes her mouth would repeatedly open before closing soon after. She wasn‚Äôt even screaming, she was just staring, the skin on her hands slipping onto the cloth and leaving her hands a fleshy mess. I focused on driving, I couldn‚Äôt bear to even look over. She needed help, and honestly, so did I.

The stay at the hospital wasn‚Äôt as long as I expected it to be. When I got her there, her hands were immediately treated as they rushed her into a surgery to try and salvage any skin they could. At the time, a nurse handed me Juliet‚Äôs belongings, some of her clothes which were the same she had changed into this morning, as well as her phone. Although I usually wouldn't, I thought this had gone far enough and I looked on her phone until I found a contact that I knew was one of her colleagues, Taylor.¬†

I didn‚Äôt know Taylor well, but I had met her a few times and she always seemed like talking was her favourite activity. She was a bit eccentric, always having at least one pink or fluffy accessory on her and she would often wear a wig which she would dramatically remove to reveal her brightly dyed shaved head. I could understand why Juliet enjoyed spending time with her in such a serious environment.

I rang her quickly, I knew she hadn‚Äôt gone on the trip as Juliet would tell me that Taylor had once called in sick because there was a small layer of snow outside and she hated the cold. But even if she hadn‚Äôt gone, I knew she still had to know something.

She answered on the second ring.

‚ÄúJuliet, are you okay?‚Äù I let out a sigh, remembering whose phone I was using. The fact that her voice was filled with worry and concern did make me stop for a second, but I imagine she just hadn‚Äôt heard from her since before the trip.

‚ÄúTaylor, It‚Äôs Sebastian, I wanted to ask you something.‚Äù I heard a sigh from the other side.

‚ÄúWhat happened? Is Juliet alright?‚Äù Her questions were obviously frantic. It felt odd, I had never heard her like this before.

‚ÄúI- Well, I don‚Äôt know. She‚Äôs hurt herself, her hands, God, her hands, Taylor. I don‚Äôt know what she was thinking. They‚Äôve taken her in for surgery now and I don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù I knew how I sounded but I didn‚Äôt care. I could hear Taylor let out a long sigh, like one you do when you‚Äôre trying to hold tears in. But still, I had to ask my question. ‚ÄúTaylor, what happened on that trip?‚Äù¬†

The line went silent for a moment, I could feel myself becoming lost but I kept myself composed, if I broke down now I doubt I would ever recover.

‚ÄúYou mean, she didn‚Äôt tell you?‚Äù I felt a chill down my spine.

‚ÄúNo, she‚Äôs barely said anything. Taylor, just tell me what happened?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSebastian, she was the only one who returned.‚Äù I almost dropped her phone before I gripped it once more, finding an empty chair to sit down on.

‚ÄúWhat, what do you mean?‚Äù I questioned, trying to not tap my foot like crazy.

‚ÄúSomething happened, they won‚Äôt say anything about it but I heard that Noah had to go to identify and collect his father‚Äôs body. They say it was the only body they could bring back for identification, the others were too far gone.‚Äù I could feel my lips shaking. Noah was Mark‚Äôs son. I had seen him yesterday, but Juliet hadn‚Äôt even acknowledged what I had said so I dropped it.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean too far gone?‚Äù I resisted the urge to bite down on my fingernails, instead digging them into the palm of my free hand.

‚ÄúThey were burnt beyond recognition, the bodies are being brought back for autopsy in a few days but identification has been removed from being a priority.‚Äù I knew I was shaking, but I didn‚Äôt care. I just found out my wife was a sole survivor in a horrific event that killed her friends, burning their bodies, and now she was in surgery for her boiled hands. Was that a coincidence? I had no idea. ‚ÄúThere was something else as well. They found a dog.‚Äù

‚ÄúA dog?‚Äù Juliet had never mentioned a dog, but then again, it probably wasn‚Äôt the first thing on her mind.

‚ÄúYeah, it was killed as well, but they found it in the snow, completely burnt. They say it‚Äôs likely it was the first killed.‚Äù I sighed, this was becoming too unreal. ‚ÄúSebastian?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhen Juliet comes out of surgery, can you let her know I called?‚Äù I smiled weakly.¬†

‚ÄúSure, thanks Taylor.‚Äù I hung up the call and just stared at the blank screen of the phone. The information of the deaths of people I had seen in the office parties I had attended with Juliet felt it was breaking me apart. I couldn‚Äôt imagine how Juliet was feeling, losing a team she spent months with throughout the year.¬†

After a while, a doctor approached me and told me that Juliet was coming out of surgery and that although they had done their best to repair her hands, she would still need to spend time resting to minimise the risk of infection and would need a checkup to ensure she was healing. I felt my heart beating at the doctor‚Äôs words but I just nodded along, following along until I was brought to her room. Tears welled up in my eyes as I saw her, bandages wrapped over her hands as she still appeared to be in a dazed state. I felt like crying, I almost did. I sat down next to her bed, placing a hand on her and just sitting. I had already spent hours in the waiting room, but this was different. I had her in front of me, I knew she was safe.¬†

After an hour, I began to search over her for any other signs of burns, like older ones but I didn‚Äôt find one. What I did find however, was still weird.

There was a bite mark, it laid on the middle of her forearm, obviously healed but it was still quite visible. I wondered if it was human but then I noticed how sharp some of the teeth appeared to be and I knew what had bitten her.

A dog.

After seeing it, I went to get her doctor and asked him about the bite. He confirmed what I had believed, it looked like the dog bites he sometimes gets in the emergency room. I asked if a bite like this could cause a change in behaviour, and he just glanced at me and shrugged, telling me that he couldn‚Äôt be sure but I would have to keep an eye on her just in case. He left soon after.¬†

I felt helpless, my wife lying unconscious in a hospital bed and I didn‚Äôt even know what was really happening.¬†

But I knew it had to stop. It had to.

A few weeks later, Juliet was deemed healthy enough to be taken home. I felt relief as I helped her get into the car and she smiled at me. Sure she wasn‚Äôt saying a lot, but still, she smiled at me. It was a start. I had the same schedule for her entire stay at the hospital. I would go to work, then immediately to the hospital to see her, before returning home and having a meal before going to sleep and repeating the cycle the next day. I knew I looked tired, even my students had begun to notice. But my wife was worse.

Not only did she look tired, but her eyes looked sunken, her hair was greasy and her frame was pale and small. I thought it was maybe because of the shock she had gone through but it seemed like she was only getting worse.¬†

When we finally arrived home, I prepared a meal for us, not anything big as I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was even up for it but enough that there would still be leftovers the next day if she wanted any.

Well, at least that‚Äôs what I thought.¬†

The moment we sat down, Juliet had begun to eat, ripping into each piece and having a taste of each piece. I had never seen her like this before. It wasn‚Äôt exactly scary but I still felt uneasy as she kept eating, using her hands to scoop up the food into a ball and shoving it in, it put me off.¬†

Unsure, I offered my own plate to her and she took it without a second thought, shovelling my food in and not even daring to say a thank you or give a little nod. I felt sick.

It reminded me of the night with the mince, the way she had eaten it with her fingers, digging in. A part of my mind felt worried, it couldn‚Äôt be safe or clean for her to use her hands right now, but it wasn‚Äôt like I could stop her.

Grabbing my fork, I pushed a mouthful onto it and offered it to her. She didn‚Äôt even bother to look up, taking it out of my hands and biting down hard. I felt a shiver and the pit inside returned once more.¬†

At one point, she had knocked a butter knife onto the floor and I grabbed it, standing up and taking it to the sink behind her. I felt the warmness of the water and felt sick once more, imagining the water boiling hot and ripping my skin off at its heat and pressure. With a shudder, I placed the butter knife down and turned to face my wife‚Äôs back, gently touching her shoulders as my fingers grazed up until I reached her neck. I looked at the window on the other side, seeing the reflection of our faces.

‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù I whispered, it felt like it had been ages since I told her that.¬†

From my fingers, I traced the back of her neck until I felt a bump across my fingertips. Looking back down, I saw what I had thought I had felt the weeks before.

There was a bump of something crawling under her skin, running up her neck as soon as my fingers touched her skin. While I couldn‚Äôt hear it, the sight of it digging through my wife‚Äôs skin made my own skin crawl with disgust. I wanted to yell out but I felt frozen, what would I even say?¬†

My wife must've noticed something was wrong as she put her plate down, pushing her head back to meet my waist. She smiled up at me but I felt nothing.

That wasn‚Äôt my wife anymore.

Taking a step back, my wife‚Äôs head rolled back around, turning to stand and face me. Her slightly healed hands were bleeding once more, the heat of the food burning through and attacking her, she hadn‚Äôt even reacted.

I grabbed a knife from our knife block, a sharp but still quite small knife that I held in front of myself.

‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù I asked her, but she didn‚Äôt answer. I hadn‚Äôt expected her to, because I knew she wasn‚Äôt my wife.¬†

She rushed towards me but I pushed her away with my arm, watching out as she snarled and bared her teeth as me, like a threat of her bite would make me stop. But it didn‚Äôt.

I pushed past her, pushing against her as I kneed her down to the kitchen floor, forcing her to lay on the cold tiles as I located what was inside her.¬†

It was laying nestled back down into her neck, I imagine it was the area it had built around the most. And while I didn‚Äôt really know what I was doing, I still did it.

I took the knife and cut into the back of her neck, being gentle to only cut through the skin as my hands shook. Once I had cut enough, I dug my fingers deeper, going through her skin until I felt something slimy in between my fingers. I pulled, but Juliet then began to fight back. She thrashed worse than before, trying to kick me in the back but I stayed on her. She let out a large scream that hurt my ears, I thought she was going to break our windows with her screams. With a final pull, I took what was between my fingers and pulled it out, letting it lay squished between them as I looked up at it.¬†

It looked like a worm, or a parasite. I remember Juliet showing me images of parasites to try and freak me out while she was studying. It was long, white with a greenish hue and had sharp teeth at one end that seemed to be covered in red. There were parts of it that appeared bloody, but I could still see it.¬†

Fear took over me as I looked down at Juliet. Her screaming had stopped, in fact, all her attacks had stopped. The worm I held appeared to still be activated so I did the only thing I knew. I stood up, placed it on the floor, and stamped on the small creature until it was a mess of red and green on the kitchen floor. I went to grab something to clean it up but that was when Juliet‚Äôs arm grabbed me. Her fingers were still stained deep red, her fingernails were almost nonexistent and her palm felt like it was sticking to my leg.

‚ÄúBurn, you have to burn it.‚Äù My face contorted into confusion as Juliet turned towards me, a pool of blood slowly leaking out from her neck. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only way to stop it, please.‚Äù Her words got to me because I knew they were her‚Äôs. I grabbed a match, lighting it on the matchbox and throwing it onto the mush on the floor. It was like the body ignited the flames more, becoming a large flame in only a few seconds. After setting the fire, I didn‚Äôt bother to look at it, I needed to tend to my wife. Her neck was still bleeding but I couldn‚Äôt stop it. I placed my hand over the back of her neck to try and keep pressure on it, like I had seen it done before, but I truly did not know. Did I cut too deep? I had wondered as Juliet‚Äôs hand went to grab one of mine, sliding her wrist against mine as I turned her over and stared into her eyes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù I whispered to her. She smiled gently, her pale face somehow becoming even more pale. She just kept staring at me.

‚ÄúI know, Seb, I know.‚Äù She just kept smiling, even as the blood pool under her caused my hand to suddenly let go of her neck and a spurt of blood to escape out. I let out a short cry but she just kept smiling, tears welling up in her eyes with each passing second. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôll all be okay.‚Äù¬†

That was how the police had found us, my wife on the ground and bleeding, my hands covered in blood and squeezing the back of her neck, a fairly large flame erupting next to us. One of our neighbours must have called them after hearing Juliet‚Äôs screams, or maybe after seeing the flame.

The police let paramedics in and they took her away, ripping me away from her and taking me to their car to drive to the station. I could see some firefighters as well to tackle the fire before it got out of hand.

The police had questioned me, asking what had happened. I explained everything. Yes, I know that this would make me sound insane, but I had to tell them. The officers questioning me exchanged a glance before they were called out of the room by another officer. I just sat there, blood staining my hands as they told me that my wife‚Äôs injuries had been too severe and had died from a combination of blood loss and shock. I sobbed right there in the station, covering my eyes as the officers told me I was being arrested for murder before I could fully process what was happening.

I screamed at them to stop.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt her! It wasn‚Äôt her! Please, I had to save her.‚Äù I doubt the officers were even listening anymore as they took me away.

That was five years ago now, but you‚Äôre probably wondering what happened after that. Well, I got given a psychiatrist and a lawyer. My lawyer had told me to take an insanity plea but I refused, I wasn‚Äôt crazy. I know what happened and while I had killed my wife, it was to save her from that worm inside her. After what felt like a lot of back and forth, I finally gave in and made my plea: not guilty by reason of insanity.¬†

Truly, I did not believe it would work, and I thought I would get life. I felt like I deserved life. That didn‚Äôt happen.

What did happen is I was found not guilty and told to be in a psychiatric facility until it was deemed safe for me to return to society.

I spent two years of my life there, spending every waking moment thinking about that night, the look on my wife‚Äôs face. I could barely remember what I had said to her in her final moments. Was I caring enough? It hadn‚Äôt felt like it.¬†

I didn‚Äôt get a lot of visitors while I was there. There were times when I wondered if I was even allowed visitors. I had expected my parents or my in-laws, someone to come see me. But they didn‚Äôt. To them, I was the messed up history teacher who had a psychotic break and killed his wife. Well, an unemployed history teacher, the high school where I worked made it clear to me that I would never step foot in the school. I knew I was the talk of that school now, and a part of me wondered if I would even keep my licence.

The only person who did visit me whenever she could, was Taylor. Her hair was still shaved, dyed a bright yellow. She wore a dress that had a lemon pattern on it and a small yellow jacket that only covered half her arms. I was amazed she could even keep up her appearance after losing Juliet, I definitely couldn‚Äôt. By the time I was finally deemed safe to return, she had dyed her hair three different times. Once to a bright pink, then a dark purple when her attempt to use blue dye didn‚Äôt work out and then to a lighter purple soon after. She was my only anchor when I was let out and had nowhere to go, we barely knew each other but now she was letting me stay with her until I could get back on my feet and begin my life again.¬†

It felt wrong, and it was impossible for me to get a job when they discovered what happened when they searched my name. But, I still made it work. I became an online history tutor for a few months, making money by teaching people online, but it wasn‚Äôt going to help at all. I still had my bank account from before I was arrested, but me and Juliet always had separate accounts so the amount in mine was significantly less than what I imagine was still in her‚Äôs. A part of me never wanted to do anything again, that this is what I deserve for what I did. But after a bit more digging, I found a place that would allow me to be a cleaner for them, working night shifts only. It felt good to have a job again, and after a while working there, as well as my tutoring and some help from Taylor, I was able to get a small apartment. And since then, I‚Äôve been living here ever since.¬†

My parents still haven‚Äôt visited me but that was alright, I understood why. I think I saw one of my old students a few days ago but I didn‚Äôt even try to say hello. It was better that they didn‚Äôt know where I was living now. I haven‚Äôt dared think about dating again, it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd ever want to even consider. Me and Juliet were together for over ten years, a part of me wants to say fifteen years but I know that‚Äôs not true, she‚Äôs gone. I had asked Taylor what happened to the home, our home, but she just shrugged it off and told me that Juliet‚Äôs parents had sold it not long after her death and to not worry about it anymore. But that‚Äôs all I did everyday. I know that some people believe I should have gotten a longer sentence, that I should have been in there for the rest of my life, but what they didn‚Äôt understand is I already had a life sentence: guilt.¬†

Guilt is something I live with everyday for what happened, knowing it is something I can never take back. I had done what was needed in order to try and save my wife, and it had resulted in failure.¬†

I had spent years of my life in that facility, being told that what I had seen wasn‚Äôt real. That I had gone crazy, killed my wife over something I thought I had seen and then tried to cover up what I had done by burning the place down.¬†

That wasn‚Äôt what happened, but they didn‚Äôt care.¬†

This is where I leave this chapter of my life. Part of me wants to believe that it was just an episode I had gone through, that I hadn‚Äôt seen anything but I knew I had. I knew what had happened and what was going to happen to me if she had bit down on me like that dog did to her. But for now, I just need to be told that I did see something, that there was something which I had cut out of her and had lightened. I tried to ask Taylor about it but she acted like it never happened, like it wasn‚Äôt her that let me know what happened to my wife‚Äôs team out there. So, I put it to you, I need to move on with my life but I can‚Äôt do that until I know that what I saw was real and not my mind playing tricks on me once more. I‚Äôm sorry for what I have done, but I need to find a way to keep myself feeling sane for once.¬†",10,1752844955.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Same bullshit constantly. Fucking get with it. So what if it's old? Go buy a digicam and have some fun, I promise it's a better use of your time than sitting in your feelings about it. Jog around the track a little, do ten minutes of yoga in the morning and stop drinking your IPAs all week. Drink a coffee and go to a club gig, nobody cares that you're old as long as you're not being a creep and you mind your distance. Yeah, you'll be tired, boo hoo, you won't be an antisocial fuck with nothing to look forward to in life anymore. Literally bring your kids too. I see it, slap some ear protrection on them (and yourself really). Get them a skateboard and ride around with them, nobodys asking you to kickflip. Not doing fun shit is what makes you old.

It's so fucking irritating. Yeah, we're not 'the youth,' anymore. So what? I manage a shop that has some cassette tapes. Some kid came in and asked ""what is this rectangle?"" I had a little laugh internally while explaining it and they were psyched (and everyone knows about vinyl still/again). I didn't have some existential crisis. 

Don't send yourself to the emotional or physical grave voluntarily with this attitude. Shit's older, embrace it, you have the wisdom to know what is or isn't bullshit and you can enjoy the stuff that isn't. That's a GIFT. Get it fucking together.

1m3234t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m3234t/will_mr_coffee_14_cup_programmable_coffee_maker/,Will Mr. Coffee 14 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker Redefine Your Brewing Experience? Review,"**Sleek Design and Build Quality**

I recently got my hands on the *Mr. Coffee 2143561 14-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker*, a machine that‚Äôs all about elegance meeting utility. Its stainless steel exterior adds a polished and modern touch to any kitchen, easily blending in with both contemporary and traditional interiors. I‚Äôve placed it next to other appliances, and it doesn‚Äôt look out of place; if anything, it elevates the vibe. It's worth noting that the dimensions‚Äî8.7""D x 11.4""W x 15.1""H‚Äîmay require a bit of height clearance if you have overhead cabinets, but it manages to look sleek rather than bulky. The lightweight 6.6-pound build made moving it around my counter for the perfect spot a breeze. The matte finish ensures that smudges don‚Äôt show easily, so it stays clean-looking with minimal effort. 

**User-Friendly Controls and Interface**

Operating this drip coffee machine has been simple, thanks to its straightforward button interface. The human interface is intuitive, and within minutes of unboxing, I was programming my first brew without needing to go through a manual. Whether you're using the Small Batch setting for one to four cups or scheduling coffee with the Brew Later function, everything feels effortless. The buttons respond well to presses, and there‚Äôs nothing overly complicated about setting it for the morning routine. 

[Check Mr. Coffee 2143561 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c8ryg85n/)

**Performance and Brewing Quality**

This machine brews coffee like a pro, and that's not just hearsay‚ÄîI‚Äôm speaking from experience here. The Strong Brew Selector is a standout feature, producing bold, aromatic coffee when I‚Äôm in need of an extra caffeine kick. On mornings where something milder suits the mood, I skipped this setting, and every cup still turned out smooth and full of flavor. One feature I immediately appreciated was the advanced showerhead, which evenly saturates the coffee grounds for optimum flavor extraction. Whether I prepared a full 14-cup batch or just used the smaller batch mode for 1-4 cups, it always managed to deliver consistent quality.

**Key Benefits**

- Strong Brew Selector for bolder coffee
- Small Batch mode adapts for mornings when you need fewer cups
- Sleek stainless steel design suitable for modern kitchens  

**Limitations**

That said, the brewing process isn‚Äôt lightning quick. A full pot does take several minutes, which might be a pinch point if you‚Äôre in a hurry. For impatient mornings, I relied on the Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause feature, which lets you sneak a cup mid-brew without spills, but it‚Äôs not a total time-saver. Another downside might be its height‚Äîif you have limited space between cabinets, it‚Äôs something to consider, particularly for kitchen setups with limited vertical room.

- Slower brewing time for large batches
- Taller build may not fit tightly packed countertops  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Hats off to the built-in cleaning cycle for reducing manual effort. Let‚Äôs face it, cleaning coffee makers is no one‚Äôs favorite task, but with the automatic cleaning mode, I feel less guilty about skipping regular maintenance. Additionally, the reusable coffee filter included is both a sustainable choice and dishwasher-safe. That said, I do wish the water reservoir was detachable, as cleaning it isn‚Äôt as seamless as the rest of the components.

**Competing Products**

When pitted against competitors like the Ninja CP301 or the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1, this programmable coffee maker finds solid ground in its larger 14-cup capacity. While the Ninja model stands out with its versatility in brewing tea and coffee, it lacks the advanced water filtration system that removes up to 97% of chlorine from water‚Äîa feature that truly enhances the coffee flavor here. On the other hand, Cuisinart models tend to be slightly pricier, and while they offer reliable features, they don‚Äôt necessarily outperform the value provided by this machine, particularly with the Brew Later tool and adjustable Keep Warm settings.

**Budget-Friendly Features**

What I appreciate the most about this device is its ability to balance feature-rich functionality with affordability. For someone who enjoys quality coffee without needing to invest in overly fancy machines, this provides excellent bang for the buck. Wireless connectivity or extra gadgetry might be missing, yet it covers the essentials perfectly. If there‚Äôs something out there with better coffee flavor for the price, I haven‚Äôt tried it yet.

1m321fr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m321fr,"Vov√≥ Candinha (Faz. Guariroba, Mant√≠) - Tirei at√© a poeira dos Sibarist pra fazer esse caf√©. Quem provou, ajuda n√≥s aqui?","Edi√ß√£o limitada (350 unidades). Lan√ßado na feira em SP h√° alguma semanas. 

Ouvi falar muito bem desse caf√©, ent√£o at√© saquei o Sibarist (filtro r√°pido) pra testar. 

**Primeira extra√ß√£o** bem interessante, mas achei dif√≠cil de extrair. Mesmo com moagem bem fina (2.5 no ZP6 + drip assist), senti que faltou corpo (algo normal para o filtro sibarist e para drip assist). Al√©m disso, talvez o tempo (~2min), a quantidade de ataques e a √°gua (90c) foram baixos demais pra esse gr√£o.

Testei essa primeira receita mais ‚Äúleve‚Äù pois eu estava esperando uma pancada. Os outros 2 caf√©s da Fazenda Guariroba torrados pelo Mant√≠ que tomei (Gesha e Catuai Vermelho, os melhores caf√©s que tomei em 2025) tinham muita personalidade e intensidade. Maaaaas parece que esse Vov√≥ Candinha √© mais delicado. Ent√£o ajustei os par√¢metros na pr√≥xima receita.

**Segunda extra√ß√£o** - Hoje testei novamente, adicionando mais um ataque, alongando a extra√ß√£o para 3min, subindo a √°gua para 94c. Melhorou, mas deu adstring√™ncia e leve amargor. 

Na pr√≥xima receita, vou mirar em 2m30s, mantendo a √°gua a 90c (talvez o ‚Äúamargor‚Äù que senti seja da fermenta√ß√£o, ent√£o a √°gua mais fria vai ajudar). 

Como a primeira receita saiu leve demais, e a segunda deu ind√≠cios de super extra√ß√£o (mas ainda com baixo corpo e dul√ßor), minha hip√≥tese √© que talvez esse seja um caf√© mais suave e leve, com notas e corpo n√£o t√£o intensos.

Pra quem provou:
- Esse caf√© √© mais suave e delicado mesmo? 
- Que receita funcionou por a√≠?

Ps.: nunca tinha ouvido falar nesse processo (‚Äúrota aer√≥bica e anaer√≥bica‚Äù). Imagino que seja fermenta√ß√£o tipo natural primeiro, seguido de fermenta√ß√£o anaerobica (tanque fechado) - ou o contr√°rio (?). Algu√©m sabe explicar?

While i was walking home from the shop i started to have hot sweats about 15 mins later, when i went home i had an anxious feeling and that countinued for about 3 hrs progressively getting worse at abt hr 4 i semi blacked out and fell into a wall 5 times trying to open a door before sitting down and feeling extremely dizzy ( my heart rate and pulse were about twice normal limit) after drinking water i felt slightly better and ate something still feeling anxious i tried to eat a little more over the next hour until i had to go to the toilet bc of the drinking and felt better (hr 6-7) I still feel slightly anxious and sore but without the very anxious quick feeling. also i was sweating alot during hr 4-5.

i am quite small 5,8 65kg and normally dont drink coffee although when i do i dont have a reaction

was there a chance i was just sick regulary?

1m31ykh,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1m31ykh/explore_vasterqua_appliance_sliders_review_for/,Explore Vasterqua Appliance Sliders Review for Effortless Movement of Heavy Kitchen Appliances,"Vasterqua B0CLY2X6CH 24Pcs Appliance Sliders have recently been a game-changer in my kitchen. I never expected something so small to have such a significant impact on my everyday routine. These self-adhesive sliders aren‚Äôt just another kitchen gadget; they‚Äôve become indispensable when dealing with heavy kitchen appliances like my air fryer, stand mixer, and that hefty coffee maker I can't live without. Testing these for a few weeks gave me a solid sense of their strengths, quirks, and overall value.

**Compact Design and Wide Compatibility**  
At first glance, the small 3/4‚Äù diameter of these appliance sliders might look unassuming. However, their size is incredibly practical since they remain hidden, blending seamlessly with your appliances. I tested them on several household gadgets, and they‚Äôre as versatile as claimed‚Äîworking on coffee makers, a bulky stand mixer, and even the pressure cooker. It‚Äôs like having tiny helpers smoothing out the movement of machines I‚Äôd previously dreaded dragging across the countertop! Who thought these sliders would work so well on marble, wood, and stainless-steel counters too?  

[Check Vasterqua B0CLY2X6CH price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0cly2x6ch/)

**Ease of Installation**  
The installation process was super simple, which saved me from any unnecessary frustration. After cleaning the base of each appliance thoroughly, I merely peeled off the adhesive backing, stuck the sliders onto the bottom, and gave it 12 hours to set. Voila, they were ready for action! I appreciated not having to use tools‚Äîa relief for someone who doesn‚Äôt consider themselves particularly handy. It‚Äôs worth noting that the adhesive felt strong, but I was still a bit skeptical about long-term durability. The instructions mentioned wiping the appliance base before application for the best grip, which proved to be an important step.

**Durability and Heavy-Duty Performance**  
These sliders don‚Äôt mess around when it comes to supporting weight. Manufactured with premium PTFE and reinforced rubber, they had no problem handling the pressure cooker that weighs close to an arm workout. I tried moving my stand mixer‚Äîa notorious heavyweight‚Äîand was amazed by how effortlessly it glided across the counter. While their sturdiness gives the impression of consistent long-term use, I‚Äôll keep an eye on how well they hold up after extended wear.

**Perks**  
- Compact hidden size blends in with appliances.  
- Works on a variety of countertop surfaces, including wood, marble, and stainless steel.  
- Strong adhesive ensures sturdy placement.  
- Extremely useful for awkward, heavy kitchen gadgets like air fryers and coffee makers.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Adhesive placement requires precision; removing misplaced sliders can be tricky.  
- Waiting 12 hours for the adhesive to dry before use felt like a long time.  
- With frequent use, it‚Äôs unclear if the adhesive will last as long as the materials themselves.  

**Performance vs. Competitors**  
Comparing these appliance sliders with pads from other brands, I noticed a stark difference. Many competing products either lack the durability or compatibility to support multiple appliance types. A rival product I previously purchased didn‚Äôt hold up against my stand mixer‚Äôs weight‚Äîthe adhesive pad peeled off within a few days. When it comes to versatility, the Vasterqua sliders take the edge as they work with more appliance types and across multiple counter materials. Not every slider out there performs well on slippery marble, but these handled such surfaces without compromise.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering overall functionality, the price-to-quality ratio pleases me. You might find cheaper adhesive sliders on the market, but those don‚Äôt last or deliver the ease of movement this set provides. This is a classic case of getting what you pay for‚Äîsolid utility for moving heavy kitchen appliances without hassle. They may not fall into the ‚Äúbudget-friendly‚Äù category; however, given their sturdy materials and effectiveness, they‚Äôre worth every penny for anyone struggling with heavy gadgets.

The first day I def felt the emotional regulation piece for a window of time. I feel like it took away all my shame and RSD and I had a sense of confidence I didn't realise had been missing. I don't think I had this experience besides the first day.

I found it hard to work out whether the dose was too low or too high. I had some small windows of being able to focus, and small windo of  not be stuck in paralysis (just do things automatically without it being a cognitive load - like clean up after myself).

But I also felt a bit like a zombie, brain-foggy, over dissociating more than normal, not able to focus, at times perpetually distracted and going down lots of rabbit holes, I got a bit ragey, I had a tension in my abdomen, and couldn't sleep very well (basically wired at night), headaches too. Also I think I felt a tiny bit ""high"" but like  a crappy high.

I didn't realise the impact of coffee and not eating every few hours / protein, and also crashing so some of the issues could have been because of this. I thought it was because I started off an a dose that was too high for me. (I'm also autistic and my organism is quite sensitive to everything- including not getting enough sleep, so that could also be part of the impact).

So I swapped to dexies so I could work my way up from a lower dose. (5mg morning, 5mg arvo).

The experience on dexies is pretty similar although I felt slightly more productive in the morning. 

I guess my question is do I try to increase to 10mg, or is this drug just not for me?

The first one Uber said that the person can change their tip for up to 14 days.

The second one the customer did not respond so Uber canceled the order and I got $2.77 for driving 10 1/2 miles because the customer would not answer. The timer would not start because the pinpoint was in the middle of the road that I could not stop on. so Uber canceled the order after I waited over 10 minutes for response from the customer. The total delivery time took over 40 minutes. But because Uber canceled it I only got $2.77. I believe if the customer decides not to answer, that is their fault and I should not be screwed out of my money because they don‚Äôt wanna answer. They should be charged for the food, considering that it cannot be taken back to the store. So now the store won‚Äôt get paid because it wasn‚Äôt delivered as well as the fact that I won‚Äôt be paid because I didn‚Äôt deliver it.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

""What Never Was"" by invntry

Chapter One: The Warning

It started in early April, on a Wednesday. Rain had just begun to tap against the coffee shop windows with a soft persistence, the kind of rhythm that makes you feel lonelier than you already are. I was seated near the back, half-heartedly flipping through the pages of a novel I had brought more for comfort than interest. My coffee had gone cold, untouched since my first sip.

She walked in like she had fallen from the sky with the rain. Not in a poetic, angelic way, but like the world had dropped her here mid-thought. No umbrella. A single canvas bag hung from her shoulder, heavy and slightly misshapen. Her earbuds were still in, wires disappearing into her pocket. Her hoodie clung to her, soaked dark at the seams, her hair stuck in clumps along her cheek and collar. She took one quick look around, not scanning for someone, just getting her bearings, and picked a table two spots away from mine.

There was no pause to shake off the rain. No glance to check who might be watching. She pulled a notebook out from her bag, sat down, and began to write. The room didn‚Äôt seem to notice her, but I did. She had a way of settling into space without asking permission. Not bold. Not performative. Just entirely certain that she belonged wherever she was in that moment.

I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time. She wasn‚Äôt the first interesting stranger I‚Äôd ever seen. But something about the way she moved caught me off guard. Her presence wasn‚Äôt loud, but it was firm. She sat like someone who knew exactly how much space she was allowed to take up and wasn‚Äôt interested in asking for more. And for reasons I didn‚Äôt understand at the time, I couldn‚Äôt stop glancing her way.

The second time I saw her, we spoke. It was late, almost closing time. I was at the same coffee shop, this time nursing a lukewarm cup out of routine more than enjoyment. She recognized me first. Said she remembered the book I had been reading. I laughed with a level of ease I wasn't familiar with. I had no issue laughing off that I hadn‚Äôt even made it past page fifty. That broke the ice. We talked until the lights dimmed and the staff politely asked us to leave.

Her voice had a rhythm that made silence feel like part of the conversation. She didn‚Äôt speak to fill space. Every word had weight. When she laughed, it was sudden and whole, like it came from the center of her chest. She had this way of making the moment feel more solid, more real. I walked home that night with her number saved in my phone and the kind of buzz you don‚Äôt want to explain in case saying it out loud makes it disappear.

From the beginning, she was honest. She told me there was someone else. Not a boyfriend. Not exactly. Someone from her past who she had never really let go of. They were still talking. Still connected. Still something. She didn‚Äôt say it like a warning, more like a fact of life. A parameter. A line in the sand.

I nodded. I said I understood. I think I even meant it. At the time, the thought of being close to someone like her felt worth the risk of proximity. I figured I could handle the boundaries. That I could care without needing anything back. I‚Äôd done it before.

We started spending time together slowly. Coffee turned into walks. Walks turned into evenings. Eventually I knew her routines. Knew which mug she preferred for tea. Knew which drawer held the snacks she tried to hide. She made the ordinary feel curated. Even folding laundry with her felt like a ritual. Like time had slowed down just enough to let us notice it.

She wasn‚Äôt theatrical or overly affectionate, just present. When we talked, she looked me in the eye. When we laughed, it felt earned. Everything between us was built on pauses and honesty.

Some nights, when we were both too tired to do anything else, we‚Äôd lie on the couch and watch reruns of old sitcoms. Her feet would end up tucked under my leg, her head resting lightly on my shoulder. There was never a conversation about what we were. There didn‚Äôt need to be. The silence filled in the blanks.

But even then, I felt it. The ceiling. The limit she couldn‚Äôt step beyond. Some part of her was always somewhere else. Tethered to a version of love I would never be. I told myself it was fine. That it was enough. I wasn‚Äôt being lied to. I wasn‚Äôt being led on. And yet, I kept hoping that maybe, over time, things would shift.

Chapter Two: The Line We Crossed

By the time October rolled around, staying over had become something we fell into naturally. We had spent the day picking up furniture she found online. She made it a game, seeing if we could get it all into my car without taking it apart. We failed, of course, but we laughed through every failed attempt. That night, after hauling everything in and setting it in place, we sat on the floor and shared a meal from our favorite Chinese spot, our hands dirty, our legs stretched out yet tangled together.

It wasn‚Äôt unusual by then to fall asleep beside each other. Some nights I‚Äôd stay over after too many glasses of wine or a movie that ended too late. We‚Äôd curl up in the blankets without a word, and it always felt natural. Her body fit against mine like we were meant to share space. She'd fall asleep easily. I rarely did. I‚Äôd lie there in the dark, listening to the way her breathing slowed, sometimes brushing my fingers through her hair or just watching the outline of her shoulder rise and fall.

There was a closeness in those moments I hadn‚Äôt felt in years. It wasn‚Äôt about the promise of sex or any kind of romantic milestone. It was just the comfort of another human choosing to let you in while the world outside went quiet.

She let me hold her. She‚Äôd shift into me like she was meant to be there, like she knew exactly where her place was and it was right against my chest. We didn‚Äôt talk about it, didn‚Äôt define it, but it was there. A quiet rhythm we built together over nights and mornings that bled into each other.

I don‚Äôt know what time it was, but I woke to her squeezing me tightly as if she thought I might float away. Her arms were wrapped around my ribs, her body pressed so close it was like she was trying to hold my breath in place. As I slowly became aware of where I was, her head still rested on my chest, warm and heavy. I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt want to break whatever fragile thing was still being offered in that moment.

She looked up at me, slow and deliberate, with those eyes I had never truly found the directions to navigate. They always seemed to carry more than I could decode. But that night, something in them had shifted. There was a quiet urgency in her gaze, not desperate but deliberate, as if she had made up her mind about something while I slept. There was weight in the silence she offered me, like a question she was afraid to ask out loud. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was need or fear or something in between, but whatever it was, it felt like we were standing at the edge of a moment neither of us could take back.

She slowly found her way into my lap, gently straddling me with the kind of movement that didn‚Äôt ask permission but didn‚Äôt need to. Her knees rested on either side of me, steady and sure. She settled into the moment with purpose. Her arms wrapped around my neck, and she leaned in close, our faces inches apart. Her breath was warm, her presence immediate.

She stared into my eyes without blinking, like she was searching for something she couldn‚Äôt quite name. There was no hesitation. No second guessing. Just that focused, intimate stillness that made the room fall away. It wasn‚Äôt about seduction. It wasn‚Äôt about proving anything. It felt like she was trying to reach the part of me I always kept hidden, even from myself.

She leaned in and kissed me. Softly, like she was testing the surface. I kissed her back, but it wasn‚Äôt instinct. It was a deliberate choice, one part curiosity and one part confession. The moment was quiet. Slow. Heavy. When it ended, we just looked at each other, her hands still gently resting on my neck.

She stood up and held her hand out. I followed her to the bedroom.

Her body found its place against mine as it had every night before. We didn‚Äôt sleep together, not in the physical sense. We lay side by side, fully clothed, her head tucked under my chin. At one point, her hand moved under my shirt, resting lightly on my chest. I felt a chill run through my core. Fear swept over me like a tidal wave. Fear of what this meant. Fear of what I would lose if I couldn‚Äôt meet her there.

She noticed.

""You're shaking,"" she whispered.

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. It wasn't that I didn‚Äôt trust her. I did. I'd grown to feel safe around her in ways I hadn‚Äôt experienced in a long time. But for me, intimacy has never been just about the moment. It‚Äôs never been casual. It‚Äôs a door I don‚Äôt walk through lightly.

She was right there, gentle, open, willing, and still all I could feel was my chest tightening under the weight of what this might mean. My heart raced, not out of excitement, but fear. I had been there before. I knew what could happen when physical closeness outpaced emotional clarity. It had never once led me to something lasting. If anything, it had been the point where things began to fall apart. I‚Äôd been touched before without being known. And every time, I‚Äôd left feeling more alone than when I started.

So now, with her hand resting softly on my chest, all I could feel was the grip of my anxiety wrapping tighter around me, warning me that crossing this line could blur everything we‚Äôd built. What if it changed how she looked at me? What if this moment, tender as it was, rewrote us into something I couldn‚Äôt hold onto?

""I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm ready,"" I finally managed, barely more than a whisper.

She brushed her thumb gently across my ribs and said, ""It‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre safe with me.""

And I believed her. But I still didn‚Äôt feel safe with myself.

Eventually she fell asleep. But unlike the other nights, she turned away from me and faced the far wall, putting space between us where there hadn‚Äôt been any before. I reached out instinctively, then stopped myself. Her body no longer met mine halfway. That was the part that stuck with me. Not the kiss. Not the weight of her hand. But the quiet decision to create distance. The absence of her leaning in. The space she left.

I stayed awake, staring at the ceiling. My mind replaying the day, the kiss, her hand, the quiet. When I finally drifted off, I had already begun to grieve.

The next morning, everything was a little off. She was still kind. Still funny. But she didn‚Äôt touch me the way she had the night before. She offered me coffee like a host, not a partner. I left after breakfast and didn‚Äôt hear from her for two days.

When she did text, it was light. A passing comment. Something simple. Nothing that asked for much in return. I responded. I always did. But the shift had happened. I felt it. She was folding the moment away into a box neither of us would open again.

Chapter Three: The Driveway

The following weeks passed in a blur of half-conversations and diluted closeness. We still saw each other, but it was never quite the same. She had begun retreating into her shell, and I was left outside, pressing my hand against the glass, pretending I didn‚Äôt notice the distance growing. It was in the way she delayed responding to texts. The way she stopped inviting me to stay the night.

Then came Thanksgiving Eve. I went over to help her prep for a holiday she wasn't even celebrating herself. She said she liked the routine. The order of it. We cooked a little. Mostly we cleaned. The TV played some background show neither of us were watching. It was domestic. Familiar. And I clung to that familiarity like it was still real.

Late into the evening, she fell asleep curled up on the couch. I sat beside her in the soft light of the living room, letting the weight of the moment settle in. Her presence had always calmed me, even when words weren't exchanged. I watched the slow rise and fall of her breathing, the way her fingers twitched slightly in her sleep, like she was holding onto something in a dream. The warmth between us lingered even in the silence.

At one point, she stirred, her eyelids fluttering open just enough to register I was still there. Half-asleep, she murmured something about me carrying her to bed like I once had, her voice barely audible. Her arms reached out for me in a slow, instinctive gesture, familiar and trusting, like her body remembered before her mind fully did.

But when I started to lift her, her body tensed. I paused, thinking maybe she had drifted further back into sleep. But all of a sudden, she was wide awake. She looked at me with disappointment, and almost as if I were a stranger.

""Why are you still here? You should go home,"" she said without any hesitation.

I didn‚Äôt argue. I just stood there for a moment, trying to make sense of how quickly something could turn. I‚Äôm not sure why I thought that in that moment she was finally letting me back in. Not just in the metaphorical sense, but in the literal. It had been almost a month since our last night together. A part of me had been holding out hope that time would close the distance between us. But it had only given her the time she needed to reshape the way she saw me. Time to revise the version of us that had once felt warm and weightless into something cooler, more manageable. Something she could now set aside without guilt.

Then, without anything more than a goodnight, I grabbed my keys and left.

I drove home in silence. No music. No thoughts, really. Just a steady, heavy weight pressing down on everything. I pulled into my driveway around three in the morning and sat there for a long time. The street was empty. The houses were dark. I could hear the ticking of the engine cooling as I stared through the windshield at nothing.

There was a quiet in that moment that didn‚Äôt feel peaceful. It felt hollow. Like the world had moved on and left me behind.

I kept hearing her voice. The flatness in her tone. The finality of it. I wondered if she‚Äôd already forgotten the warmth we used to share. If she meant it when she said she loved me earlier that evening, or if that too had just slipped out, something soft and careless in the haze of half-sleep. I wondered if she sat awake too, staring at her ceiling or scrolling through her phone, struggling to find sleep in the midst of missing me. Or if she had drifted off without giving me a second thought.

I sat in that car long enough for the cold to seep into my bones, not because I was waiting for anything, but because I didn‚Äôt know where else to go.

Chapter Four: The Fade

The days that followed passed in slow motion. I tried to keep things normal between us, to pretend nothing had shifted. I‚Äôd text her the way I always had. A picture of something funny I saw, a link to a song I thought she might like, some little thought I didn‚Äôt want to forget to share. She always responded, but the replies came later and with fewer words. The conversation didn‚Äôt build the way it used to. It just looped politely and ended without warmth.

I started timing how long it would take her to write back. I hated that I noticed. I hated that I cared. But when you‚Äôre used to someone answering with eagerness, silence starts to sound like rejection. She wasn‚Äôt cruel. She didn‚Äôt ghost me. She just began to vanish slowly, like someone easing out of a room without closing the door.

I saw her once that week. I asked if she wanted company after work and she said sure. Not yes, just sure. When I showed up, she seemed happy to see me, or at least not unhappy. We sat on her couch and watched something on TV, but I can‚Äôt remember what. She leaned against the pillow instead of against me. Her laugh came less often. Her attention wandered. At some point, she scrolled through her phone while I was talking. Not to be rude, just because she could.

She mentioned him again. The guy she had told me about that first night. Said he had a new job and they were figuring out time to visit. I nodded, said that was great. I don‚Äôt know what I looked like when I said it, but it wasn‚Äôt how I felt.

He didn‚Äôt live nearby. In fact, he lived on the other side of the world. There was a 14-hour time difference between them. And yet, somehow, they managed to stay close. She told me how they would find the strangest windows of time to talk. Early morning her time, late night his. Or the reverse. It didn‚Äôt seem to matter. They found a way. That was what stuck with me. They found a way.

A quiet jealousy crept in. Not loud or angry. Just this persistent ache. I didn‚Äôt envy him. I envied the version of her he got to experience. The one that waited. The one that hoped. I wondered what it would feel like to be worth that kind of effort to someone. To be the person who made time bend. To be the one she rearranged her world for.

She spoke about him with light in her eyes. Not in a romantic way. Not overtly. But there was something soft in her voice when she brought him up. Something reverent. And in those moments, I felt myself fading from her foreground. I could see it clearly now. She wasn‚Äôt pushing me away because I had failed or fallen short. She was pulling back because I hadn‚Äôt taken the leap she needed me to. The leap that might have changed how she saw me. The leap that might have validated whatever feelings she once had for me.

Now that I had sealed my fate, she was placing me somewhere else in her heart. Somewhere safer. Somewhere quieter. She needed to make space again. To clear the path for him. And that‚Äôs when I realized she wasn‚Äôt waiting for me to change. She was already preparing to let go. He was coming to visit soon. She told me with a mixture of nerves and excitement. I congratulated her. Said it would be good for her to see him after all this time. But inside, I felt the last pieces of our connection slipping out of reach.

She needed to be sure she had done nothing wrong. That her feelings for him could exist without conflict. And the only way to do that was to let go of me. Not abruptly. Not with cruelty. But with deliberate, gentle distance. It made sense. And that made it all the more painful.

Chapter Five: The Distance Between

By the time December came, we were talking less than ever. I kept busy. Work. Errands. Cleaning. I even took up running again, something I hadn‚Äôt done in over a year. I told myself it was for the exercise. Really, I just needed something that made my body hurt more than my thoughts did.

I still saw things that reminded me of her. An inside joke that we laughed at way too often. A video that seemed as if it were made with her in mind. Certain scents that lingered while doing laundry. Little moments that caught me off guard in stores or on the street. I didn‚Äôt always tell her about them. Not anymore. I started keeping them to myself like relics. Things I wasn‚Äôt sure she‚Äôd want anymore.

We met once for dinner in January. She picked the place. Casual, familiar. I think we both knew it was more of a closing scene than a chance to reconnect. The restaurant was half full and quiet, the kind of spot where people don‚Äôt need to raise their voices to be heard.

We caught up like old friends. Talked about what we‚Äôd been doing. She spoke about someone new. Not the guy she waited for, someone else entirely. Her smile came easier when she mentioned him. I remember wondering if he knew about me. Probably not. Or maybe I wasn‚Äôt the type of friend she thought necessary to mention.

I told her how I‚Äôd been. I didn‚Äôt lie. I just edited. I left out the loneliness. The dreams where we were back at that coffee shop laughing over nothing as total strangers. The mornings I would wake up wishing she was by my side or checking my phone for the good morning text that she had sent every morning she wasn‚Äôt.

At the end of the meal, I walked her to her car. The cold had settled deep by then, clinging to skin and stiffening breath. We stood there for a while, our bodies close but not touching, her hands buried in her coat pockets like she was holding something fragile inside them. I looked at her, hoping for some sign, some invitation to speak. But her expression was soft and unreadable. I opened my mouth more than once, trying to find the right combination of words, something to sum up what she‚Äôd meant to me, what this version of us had been. Everything I came up with sounded hollow in my head, too dramatic or too small. And so I stood there, silent, my breath fogging in the air between us, feeling like I was watching the final scene of a show that would never air again.

She hugged me. Quick. Polite. I said, ""Take care,"" and she nodded.

And then she left.

Chapter Six: What Never Was

Weeks passed without another word. There was no final argument. No dramatic goodbye. Just a quiet understanding that settled in like dust over time. I stopped reaching out. She didn‚Äôt either. And yet, she stayed in the corners of my mind, always just one thought away. I found myself rehearsing conversations I would never have. Things I might say if she ever walked back into my life with that same worn hoodie and quiet smile.

I spent more nights alone than I‚Äôd like to admit. My apartment became a museum of reminders. The blanket she once curled up in still lived on the couch. The mug she used the most stayed in the same place in the cabinet. I could have moved it, put it away, thrown it out even, but I didn‚Äôt. Maybe part of me needed those things to remain exactly where they were. To hold proof that it had all actually happened.

Sometimes I wondered what she told people about me. If she said my name with any weight. If she remembered my birthday. If she ever caught herself halfway through a sentence before realizing I wasn‚Äôt there to hear it.

I tried dating again. Once or twice. The women were kind. Beautiful, even. But they weren't her. They didn‚Äôt make silence feel like safety. They didn‚Äôt know how I took my coffee or why I always checked the locks twice before bed. It wasn‚Äôt their fault. They just weren‚Äôt built into the same quiet, familiar rhythm she and I had somehow stumbled into. And I wasn‚Äôt ready to build a new one from scratch.

I started writing again. Not about her. Not directly. But everything I put down had pieces of her in it. Lines that hinted at a night spent watching bad television. A character who picked the onions out of her food. Small things only I would notice. Little fingerprints she left behind that even time couldn‚Äôt erase.

One night, I walked by the coffee shop where we first met. It had been renovated. New lighting. Different chairs. The walls had been painted. None of the old staff remained. But the rain tapped on the windows just the same, and for a moment, I saw her there again. Just a flicker. A memory. Her notebook open. Her hair damp. Writing like the world wasn‚Äôt watching. And me, sitting two tables away, already falling without realizing it.

She was never mine. Not in the way that counts. What we had didn‚Äôt have a name, a title, or a proper ending. But it was real. It mattered. Even if only to me. She wasn‚Äôt the right person, but she was the right feeling, a glimpse into what my perfect relationship will be like someday.

And maybe that‚Äôs all it ever needed to be.

Epilogue:

Time passed. More than I realized. Seasons shifted, calendars flipped, and one day I stopped measuring my weeks by the frequency of our conversations.

A friend of mine mentioned her in passing a couple of months ago. Said they had caught up briefly. Told me the guy she was once willing to wait for had finally visited. It didn‚Äôt go the way she hoped. There had still been a spark between them, something warm, something real. But when she confessed how she felt, he let her down gently. Said it wasn‚Äôt the right time in either of their lives. That maybe in another version of their story, things would have worked. But not now. Not like this.

You‚Äôd think that would have brought me some kind of closure. Maybe even satisfaction. But it didn‚Äôt. If anything, it made everything feel smaller. More human. We had both loved someone we couldn‚Äôt be with. We had both waited for a version of love that couldn‚Äôt exist the way we needed it to. And when it didn‚Äôt arrive, we each did what people do. We moved on. In our own ways.

Life hasn‚Äôt changed dramatically. I still keep busy. Still have days where the silence feels heavier than usual. I still write. I still run. On occasion I find myself thinking of her. Not with longing or regret. But with quiet respect. As a reminder that I‚Äôm capable of feeling something deep and real without needing it to be wrapped in physicality. That connection doesn‚Äôt always require possession.

I don‚Äôt wish to undo what we had. I don‚Äôt even wish we had started differently. Because then it wouldn‚Äôt have been the same. It wouldn‚Äôt have taught me what it did. As is everything else in life, this was a lesson worth learning.

I wonder if she thinks of me too. If she looks back and feels the same kind of quiet clarity. Or if I‚Äôm just another name in a chapter she‚Äôs closed for good. I guess the truth is, I‚Äôll never really know. And maybe that‚Äôs not the point.

Maybe the point is to keep moving forward with that knowledge in my back pocket. Not as baggage. But as direction. Like the worn corner of a note tucked in a book I once meant to finish.

TLDR I fell in love with a woman who was emotionally unavailable and although things didn't work out I did learn what I was looking for from a relationship. ",0,1752843821.0,tifu,10,0.31,False

2011. Steve Jobs was alive. Skyrim had just launched. Intel's Sandy Bridge ruled the world. My father bought ThinkPad T420. He thought He'd use it for maybe 3 years max.


2012. My father still using it. Still typing this post on it. 

In these 13 years, my father's T420 has:

Survived 3 accidental coffee spills (two black, one cappuccino)

Been dropped down a flight of stairs (still booted after, Windows just did a ""checking drive for errors"")

Outlived two newer laptops my father bought for ""better performance""

He Ran Windows 7, 10, Linux Mint, Fedora, Arch (regrettably), FreeBSD, and once, macOS as a joke

Been used as a blunt weapon in a cockroach situation

Lost the rubber feet but not my respect

Outperformed a $400 brand-new laptop from Walmart in daily tasks


He upgraded the RAM. Swapped in an SSD. Repasted the CPU. He gave it love. It gave my father loyalty.

The keyboard is still a joy to type on. The screen hinge is still firm. The chassis still feels like it's carved from stubbornness and spite.

People ask why my father don‚Äôt move on. He answer: ‚ÄúWhy would I leave behind something that‚Äôs never left me stranded?‚Äù

His T420 is no longer a laptop. It‚Äôs a philosophy. It‚Äôs a monument to when technology was built to last, not to impress.

If Lenovo offered him a brand-new ThinkPad in exchange for this one? He'll politely decline.

ThinkPads aren‚Äôt computers. They‚Äôre lifelong companions.


When the T420 finally dies (if it ever does), 
He is not throwing it away.

Hopefully its mine now and father gave it to me

Until then, I'll be typing on it here on Reddit.

But around the 8 week mark, I started getting this weird achiness in my joints, wrists, ankles, even my jaw sometimes. Not sharp pain, just this constant stiffness and soreness that made me feel like I was 80 years old. I'd wake up feeling like I'd run a marathon when all I did was sleep.

At first I thought maybe I was working out too hard or sleeping in weird positions, but the achiness was consistent regardless of my activity level. It was worst in the mornings and would sometimes improve throughout the day, but never fully went away.

I researched whether collagen supplements could cause joint issues and used the Prove It app to check what else was in the powder besides collagen. There were several amino acids in really high concentrations that can apparently cause imbalances if you're getting too much of certain types.

I've been off it for 2 weeks and the joint achiness is finally subsiding, but my skin is already starting to look less plump and glowy.",22,1752843518.0,SkincareAddicts,2,0.96,False

1m31lvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m31lvs/what_makes_the_cuisinart_gk1_digital_gooseneck/,What Makes the Cuisinart GK-1 Digital Gooseneck Kettle Stand Out?,"Cuisinart GK-1 Digital Gooseneck Kettle has been my go-to appliance for the past few weeks, and I‚Äôve been putting it through its paces. As someone who‚Äôs borderline obsessed with brewing the perfect cup of coffee, finding a kettle that checks all the boxes‚Äîprecision, functionality, and speed‚Äîis like finding treasure. I‚Äôm happy to report this kettle has a lot going for it, but it‚Äôs not without a few quibbles.

**Design and Build Quality**

The design is what initially caught my attention. The sleek matte black finish gives it a modern aesthetic that blends seamlessly with my kitchen‚Äôs overall vibe. At just 1 pound, it‚Äôs surprisingly lightweight without feeling flimsy. The stainless-steel construction, paired with the ergonomic stay-cool handle, exudes durability while ensuring safe handling. The precision gooseneck spout deserves serious credit for its functionality. Pouring over coffee grounds with control and grace has become a satisfying ritual thanks to its steady flow. I no longer worry about drenched filters or over-saturation.

**Performance and Temperature Control**

Practicality meets sophistication in its temperature controls. The digital temperature display on the base allows adjustments from 140¬∞F to 212¬∞F, accommodating different brewing methods. Whether I‚Äôm brewing delicate green tea or robust French press coffee, the kettle gets it right. Heating up water is impressively fast too; the 1200-watt power makes sure I‚Äôm not twiddling my thumbs on rushed mornings. The 30-minute keep-warm feature is a lifesaver; my coffee-addicted coworker couldn‚Äôt stop talking about how nifty that function is after borrowing it.

**Positives**

- Precision spout offers excellent pour control  
- Adjustable temperature settings for versatility  
- Fast heat-up time, even during busy mornings  
- Matte black design looks high-end  
- Lightweight yet feels robust and sturdy  

[Check Cuisinart GK-1 price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b08kct8t6c/)  

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**

Let me say this‚Äîit‚Äôs incredibly easy to keep this kettle in pristine condition. The stainless-steel surface wipes down easily, and the matte black finish doesn‚Äôt show fingerprints as blatantly as glossy designs. Hand washing is recommended by the manufacturer, which is what I stick to. The spout, thankfully, doesn‚Äôt trap hard water deposits, a problem I dealt with on my older kettle. However, I noticed the base doesn‚Äôt detach for cleaning, so I maneuver around it carefully.

**Disadvantages** 

- The lid doesn‚Äôt hinge and must be removed entirely‚Äîawkward during refills.  
- No audible alert when the water reaches the set temperature.  

**Target Audience and Everyday Utility**

This kettle feels tailor-made for enthusiasts of pour-over coffee, tea aficionados, and anyone who takes their hot beverages seriously. It‚Äôs also very beginner-friendly, with intuitive one-touch controls. I‚Äôve recommended it to a few friends diving into specialty coffee brewing, as it removes the guesswork with its adjustable temperature settings. The 1-liter capacity proves ideal for making enough coffee for two people, but it might leave larger households wanting more.

**Product Comparisons**

Compared to other kettles like the Fellow Stagg EKG, this one stands its ground, given the significantly lower price point. While the Fellow offers premium extras such as a built-in timer, the Cuisinart GK-1 excels with its affordability and reliable performance. On the other hand, brands like Oxo offer a more intuitive interface with audible alerts, which I admit I miss in this design. That said, the solid construction and anti-slip handle give this one an edge over flimsier alternatives.

**Cost Efficiency**

Speaking honestly, the price point combined with its features makes this kettle a fantastic choice for the budget-conscious coffee or tea lover. Other high-end brands charge almost double for very similar capabilities, so this feels like you‚Äôre getting luxury without breaking the bank. The adjustable settings and precision spout elevate the brewing experience, making it more than worth its cost.

He was supposed to be a writer. That was the dream ‚Äî publish a book, maybe two. But dreams don't pay rent in Boston. And after getting laid off from his day job and barely scraping through his third month of missed loan payments, he signed up to drive.

Nights were quiet. He liked that. People were either drunk and funny or tired and quiet. He didn't mind either.

But then, one Thursday around 2 a.m., he picked up a woman from the airport. She looked like she hadn't slept in days. No luggage. Just a leather folder clutched to her chest and eyes that looked like they'd seen a hundred lives.

She got in.
""Long night?"" he asked gently.

She nodded. ""Just got back from burying my father.""

The silence that followed wasn't awkward. It was full. Heavy, but real.

""I'm sorry,"" Eli said. And he meant it.

He could've left it there. But something in him said, ask one more thing.

""What was he like?""

The woman smiled ‚Äî not big, just enough. ""He loved poetry. Wrote me one every year on my birthday. Even when I stopped reading them.""

Eli looked at her in the mirror. ""You still have them?""

She paused. ""Yeah. Every single one. He wrote one last one before‚Ä¶ everything. I haven't opened it yet. I'm scared it'll make it too real.""

He understood that. More than she knew.

For the rest of the ride, they talked ‚Äî not about grief exactly, but about the little things. His favorite book growing up. Her dad's terrible coffee. The best 2 a.m. snack from the corner store. It wasn't deep, but it was human.

When they pulled up to her apartment, she hesitated before getting out.

Then she reached into the folder, pulled out a folded piece of paper, and handed it to him.

""My dad's last poem,"" she said. ""Read it when you feel stuck.""

Eli blinked. ""Are you sure?""

She smiled again. ""Writers need reminders too.""

She walked away before he could say anything else.

He sat there for 10 minutes before unfolding the paper.

It wasn't long. Just four lines, handwritten in shaky ink: ""Even on nights when the light feels thin,
Your words can still be shelter,
For someone you'll never meet ‚Äî
Write anyway.""

Eli cried. Not the loud kind. Just tears falling quietly in a dark car in the middle of a city that didn't know his name.

The next morning, for the first time in nearly two years, he opened his laptop.

And started writing again.

There's been a lot of confusion lately regarding certain popular brands and whether they‚Äôre **Israeli-owned** or involved in supporting Israeli activities. I‚Äôm writing this purely to share facts‚Äînot to promote or support any specific brand or company.

**Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs important:**  
If any brand or company actively supports harmful or unethical practices‚Äîwhether involving Israel or elsewhere‚Äîit‚Äôs completely justified (and sometimes necessary) to boycott them. **But before taking action**, we should clearly confirm the facts rather than relying on unverified rumors.

# ‚úÖ Fact-checking popular brands:

# üçü McDonald‚Äôs

* **Origin:** American-based multinational, headquartered in **Chicago, USA**.
* **Ownership:** Major shareholders include Vanguard and BlackRock (both American institutions). No Israeli or Jewish individual directly owns controlling shares.
* **Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s)

# üçó KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken)

* **Origin:** American brand under **Yum! Brands**, based in **Kentucky, USA**.
* **Ownership:** Fully American-owned, no known Israeli ownership.
* **Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC)

# ‚òï Starbucks

* **Origin:** American coffee company, headquartered in **Seattle, USA**.
* **Ownership:** Publicly traded American corporation; briefly operated in Israel (2001‚Äì2003) but currently has no presence or ownership ties in Israel.
* **Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks)

# üçï Domino‚Äôs Pizza

* **Origin:** American pizza chain headquartered in **Michigan, USA**.
* **Ownership:** Publicly traded, American-owned, no Israeli ownership or significant Israeli investment.
* **Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino%27s_Pizza)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è What about Banking?

* Modern banking did **NOT** originate in Israel or with Jewish communities. It evolved historically from ancient civilizations, notably medieval Europe (Italy specifically).
* Though Jewish financiers contributed historically, they did not create the banking system itself.

# üáÆüá± Real Israeli-owned Companies:

There **are** genuine Israeli-owned companies in food and technology‚Äîexamples include **Strauss Group, Osem, Angel Bakeries, Anita Gelato, etc.** But these are distinct companies, separate from popular American franchises like McDonald's, KFC, Starbucks, or Domino's.

* **Strauss Group:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss_Group)
* **Osem (Owned by Nestl√© now):** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osem_(company))

# ü§î What should we do?

If you suspect a company might support Israel directly or indirectly:

* **Check official company statements or ask them directly.**
* Confirm credible and reliable sources before spreading rumors.
* Once confirmed, **boycott if you feel ethically obligated**.

However, spreading misinformation harms our credibility. Let‚Äôs be careful to distinguish clearly between fact and rumor.

# ‚úã Bottom Line:

* **McDonald‚Äôs, KFC, Starbucks, Domino‚Äôs:** All American, NOT Israeli-owned.
* **Banking:** Global and historically European origin, NOT Israeli invention.
* **Israeli-owned companies exist**, but they‚Äôre distinct and should be clearly identified.

If any brand genuinely supports harmful Israeli activities, you absolutely have a right to boycott‚Äîbut please first ensure the facts are accurate.

This is a more in-depth guide to the synthesis, assuming you have a functional, if basic, lab setup. Every measurement and action matters.



# Step 1: Precursor Material Extraction and Purification



A. **Sourcing and Initial Crushing:** Acquire a significant amount of pseudoephedrine (PSE) or ephedrine (EPH) pills. These are the starting point. Crush them into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or a blender. The finer the powder, the better the extraction efficiency. B. **Solvent Dissolution and Filtration:** \* **Dissolution:** Transfer the crushed powder to a large beaker. Add a suitable solvent like anhydrous acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), or even denatured alcohol. The amount of solvent should be enough to fully immerse the powder and allow for stirring. Stir vigorously for 15-30 minutes to dissolve the PSE/EPH while leaving insoluble binders behind. \* **Cold Precipitation (Optional but Recommended):** If using alcohol, chilling the mixture in a freezer for an hour can help precipitate more binders. \* **Filtration:** Use a B√ºchner funnel with filter paper and a vacuum flask, or a simple funnel with coffee filters or cloth, to separate the liquid (containing dissolved PSE/EPH) from the undissolved pill binders. Collect the clear filtrate. C. **Evaporation and Crude PSE/EPH Collection:** \* **Evaporation:** Gently heat the collected filtrate using a hot plate or a water bath in a well-ventilated area (or under a fume hood if you have one). Do not use an open flame with flammable solvents. Evaporate the solvent until a sticky residue or crystalline powder remains at the bottom of the beaker. This is your crude pseudoephedrine/ephedrine. \* **Scraping:** Once dry, scrape the crude PSE/EPH from the beaker. It will likely be off-white to yellowish. \* **Recrystallization (for purity):** For a cleaner product, dissolve the crude PSE/EPH in a minimal amount of hot, fresh solvent (e.g., hot anhydrous acetone). Allow the solution to cool slowly, ideally in a freezer. Pure PSE/EPH crystals will form. Filter these crystals and dry them completely.



# Step 2: Red Phosphorus and Iodine Preparation (In-Situ Hydriodic Acid Generation)



A. **Red Phosphorus (Red P) Acquisition:** If not directly available, red phosphorus can be scraped from the strike pads of matchbooks. This is tedious and yields small amounts. A more efficient method involves heating white phosphorus (extremely dangerous, ignites on contact with air) to convert it to red phosphorus, but assume you have red P. B. **Iodine Crystal Sourcing and Crushing:** Obtain iodine crystals. If you're extracting from iodine tinctures or agricultural iodine, you'll need to evaporate the solvent and purify the crystals. Once you have solid iodine, crush it into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. C. **Ratio and Mixing for HI Generation:** \* **Stoichiometry:** The typical ratio for the reaction is roughly 1 part PSE/EPH to 1 part Red P to 1.5-2 parts Iodine by weight. Adjust based on purity. \* **Initial Mixture:** In a separate, dry beaker, combine the finely powdered red phosphorus and iodine. Mix them thoroughly. This mixture will react when heated in the presence of water to form hydriodic acid (HI), the actual reducing agent.



# Step 3: Reaction Vessel Setup (The ""Cook"")



A. **Reaction Flask Selection:** Use a round-bottom flask, preferably 3-necked, sized appropriately for your batch (e.g., 500mL to 2000mL). Ensure it's clean and dry. B. **Reflux Condenser Assembly:** Attach a reflux condenser to the central neck of the flask. Connect tubing for cold water circulation to the condenser. The condenser ensures that volatile reactants and products vaporize and then cool, condensing back into the flask, preventing loss during heating. C. **Heating and Stirring Apparatus:** \* **Heating:** Place the flask in a heating mantle or a temperature-controlled hot plate. A heating mantle provides even heat distribution. \* **Stirring:** Insert a magnetic stir bar into the flask and place it on a stirring plate, or use an overhead mechanical stirrer. Constant stirring is crucial for even heating and reaction. \* **Thermometer:** Insert a thermometer into one of the side necks to monitor the internal temperature of the reaction mixture.



# Step 4: Initiating the Reduction Reaction



A. **Loading Ingredients:** Carefully add the purified pseudoephedrine/ephedrine to the reaction flask. Then, add the pre-mixed red phosphorus and iodine. B. **Adding Water/Solvent:** Add a small amount of distilled water (usually 1-2 times the weight of the PSE/EPH). This water is critical for the in-situ formation of hydriodic acid from red P and iodine. C. **Heating and Reflux:** \* **Initial Heating:** Begin heating the mixture slowly. As it heats, the iodine and red phosphorus will react with the water to form hydriodic acid. You'll see a color change, often to a dark reddish-brown. \* **Reflux:** Once the mixture starts boiling, adjust the heat to maintain a steady, gentle reflux. This means the vapors are rising into the condenser and condensing back into the flask. The typical reflux temperature for this reaction is around 100‚àí110‚àòC (boiling point of water, plus some elevation from solutes). \* **Reaction Duration:** Maintain reflux for several hours, typically 4‚àí8 hours, depending on the purity of starting materials and the desired yield. The mixture will likely turn very dark, almost black, due to the presence of red phosphorus and byproducts.



# Step 5: Post-Reaction Processing and Neutralization



A. **Cooling and Dilution:** After the reflux period, turn off the heat and allow the reaction mixture to cool down significantly, preferably to room temperature or below. Once cooled, carefully dilute the mixture with distilled water. B. **Filtration of Red Phosphorus:** \* **Initial Filtration:** Filter the entire mixture through filter paper (e.g., coffee filters or a B√ºchner funnel) to remove the unreacted red phosphorus and any insoluble byproducts. The liquid filtrate should be clear, though it might still have a color. \* **Washing the Red P:** Wash the collected red phosphorus residue on the filter paper with small amounts of distilled water, adding the washings to your main filtrate. This ensures all the product is collected. C. **Neutralization (Basification):** \* **pH Check:** Test the pH of the filtrate. It will be highly acidic due to the hydriodic acid. \* **Slow Basification:** Slowly and carefully add a strong base, such as a solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) or ammonium hydroxide (ammonia water), while stirring constantly. **This step generates heat; add slowly!** \* **pH Adjustment:** Continue adding the base until the pH of the solution reaches around 12‚àí14. At this high pH, the methamphetamine hydrochloride salt will convert to its free base form. You might see a cloudy precipitate or an oily layer forming.



# Step 6: Solvent Extraction (Separating the Methamphetamine Free Base)



A. **Adding Non-Polar Solvent:** Transfer the basified solution to a separatory funnel. Add an equal volume (or more) of a non-polar solvent like toluene, xylene, or even pure naphtha (Coleman fuel). B. **Vigorous Shaking and Venting:** Stopper the separatory funnel and shake it vigorously for several minutes. **Crucially, periodically ""vent"" the funnel** by opening the stopcock while inverted to release built-up pressure from solvent vapors. C. **Layer Separation and Collection:** \* **Settling:** Allow the two layers to separate completely. The non-polar solvent layer (containing the methamphetamine free base) will be on top if it's lighter than water (e.g., toluene, naphtha) or on the bottom if it's heavier (e.g., chloroform, but avoid that). \* **Draining:** Carefully drain off the bottom (aqueous) layer, leaving the non-polar layer in the funnel. Repeat the extraction process (adding fresh non-polar solvent, shaking, venting, separating) at least two more times with the aqueous layer to ensure maximum extraction of the methamphetamine. Combine all non-polar extracts.



# Step 7: Conversion to Salt Form (Crystallization)



A. **Drying the Solvent:** The combined non-polar solvent extracts might contain residual water. To remove it, you can add a drying agent like anhydrous magnesium sulfate or calcium chloride, swirl, and then filter it out. This step is important for cleaner crystals. B. **HCl Gas Generation and Bubbling:** \* **Gas Generation:** In a separate, well-ventilated setup, generate dry hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas. A common method is to slowly drip concentrated sulfuric acid onto table salt (sodium chloride). The gas should be bubbled through a drying tube (e.g., containing calcium chloride) to remove moisture. \* **Bubbling:** Carefully bubble the dry HCl gas into the non-polar solvent containing the methamphetamine free base. As the HCl gas dissolves, it will react with the methamphetamine free base to form methamphetamine hydrochloride, which is insoluble in the non-polar solvent and will precipitate out. C. **Precipitation, Filtration, and Drying:** \* **Precipitation:** You will observe white crystals forming and settling at the bottom of the flask as the HCl gas is bubbled through. Continue until no more precipitate forms. \* **Filtration:** Filter the crystalline product using a B√ºchner funnel and filter paper under vacuum. \* **Drying:** Wash the collected crystals on the filter paper with a small amount of cold, fresh non-polar solvent (e.g., toluene or acetone) to remove any remaining impurities. Then, dry the crystals completely, ideally in a vacuum desiccator or by air-drying in a well-ventilated area until all solvent odor is gone.



# Step 8: Final Purification (Recrystallization)



A. **Dissolution in Hot Solvent:** Take the dried methamphetamine hydrochloride crystals. Dissolve them in the minimum possible amount of hot, clean solvent, such as anhydrous isopropyl alcohol (IPA) or anhydrous acetone. Heat gently until all crystals are dissolved. B. **Slow Cooling and Crystal Formation:** Allow the solution to cool very slowly. You can place the beaker in a warm water bath and let the bath cool down, or simply leave it at room temperature. As it cools, pure methamphetamine hydrochloride crystals will begin to form. For better crystal size, you can then place it in a freezer. C. **Final Filtration, Drying, and Storage:** \* **Filtration:** Once crystals have fully formed, filter them using a B√ºchner funnel. \* **Washing:** Wash the crystals on the filter paper with a small amount of very cold, fresh solvent (e.g., cold acetone) to remove any remaining impurities. \* **Drying:** Dry the crystals completely. This is crucial for stability and purity. \* **Storage:** Store the final, purified methamphetamine hydrochloride in a sealed, airtight container, away from light and moisture.

# Best Bottle of Rum 2025: Expert Reviews & Top Brands

Rum, a distilled alcoholic beverage made from sugarcane byproducts, or directly from sugarcane juice, is a spirit enjoyed neat, as a mixer, or as the heart of countless cocktails. With roots tracing back to the Caribbean islands, rum has evolved from a humble liquor to a complex spirit with diverse styles, aging processes, and regional variations. The sheer variety ‚Äì from light and fruity white rums to dark, smoky, and aged expressions ‚Äì makes choosing the ""best"" bottle a subjective matter. However, in 2025, certain brands and expressions have garnered important praise and attention for their extraordinary quality, craftsmanship, and overall drinking experience. This article delves into the top contenders, providing expert reviews and highlighting what makes each bottle stand out in a crowded marketplace.

The quest for the best bottle of rum goes beyond mere taste; it involves understanding the nuances of production, the artistry of blending, and the heritage of the distilleries. This article aims to guide both seasoned rum enthusiasts and curious beginners through the landscape of premium rums, highlighting exceptional bottles that represent the pinnacle of rum production in 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a bottle of rum hinges on several key features that define its character, flavor profile, and overall drinking experience.

**Sugarcane Source:** The type and quality of sugarcane used directly impact the flavor of the rum.

First, knowing the source of sugarcane used will dictate the qualities and nuances of the rum. Some producers use freshly pressed sugarcane juice, known as rhum agricole, which imparts a grassy, vegetal character. Others use molasses ‚Äì a byproduct of sugar production ‚Äì resulting in a sweeter, richer rum. The origin of the sugarcane (e.g., Barbados, Guyana, Martinique) also influences the rum's character, due to varying soil conditions and climate.

**Distillation Method:** The distillation process shapes the rum's body, strength, and aromatic profile.

Second, the type of still used will contribute to the quality. Pot stills, which operate batch by batch, produce heavier, more flavorful rums, favored for sipping. Column stills, which operate continuously, yield lighter, cleaner spirits, ideal for mixing. The number of distillations and the cut points (the selections a distiller makes of the distillate) also play a critical role in determining the final product's character.

**Aging Process:** The maturation of rum in oak barrels contributes complexity,color,and tannins.

Third, the length of aging and type of oak used will influence the rum's overall profile. Aging softens the spirit, imparting notes of vanilla, caramel, spice, and oak. The climate of the aging location significantly impacts the maturation rate, with warmer climates accelerating the process. The type of oak (e.g., American white oak, French oak) and previous use (e.g., bourbon, sherry) also influence the flavors extracted from the wood.

**Proof and Finish:** The final alcohol content and finishing techniques affect the rum's intensity and smoothness.

Fourth, the final proof or abv (alcohol by volume) that a rum is bottled at is often overseen. Higher-proof rums deliver a more intense flavor experience, while lower-proof rums may be smoother and more approachable. Finishing techniques, such as adding sugar or aging in different types of barrels, can further modify the rum's character. Unfiltered rums retain more of their natural oils and flavors, while filtered rums tend to be cleaner and brighter.

Key features to consider when selecting a premium bottle of rum:

* Single Origin or Blend
* Distillation Style
* Barrel type & Age
* Additives

## Core Benefits

The best bottles of rum offer several core benefits that elevate the drinking experience beyond the ordinary.

**Exceptional Flavor Complexity:** Premium rums boast intricate flavor profiles that evolve on the palate. For example,a well-aged rum might start with notes of caramel and vanilla,followed by hints of dried fruit,spice,and oak. The complexity arises from a combination of factors: the quality of the raw ingredients, the skill of the distiller, and the influence of the aging process. This richness allows for a deeply satisfying sipping experience, revealing new nuances with each taste.

**Superior Smoothness:** High-quality rums are remarkably smooth, lacking the harshness often associated with lower-quality spirits. Carefully controlled distillation and extended aging contribute to this smoothness, allowing the flavors to meld and soften. The absence of rough edges makes the rum more enjoyable to drink neat or on the rocks, showcasing its true character without overwhelming the palate.

**Versatility in Cocktails:** While exceptional rums are splendid sipped neat, their complexity also shines in cocktails. A well-chosen rum can elevate classic recipes like the daiquiri,old fashioned or rum punch,adding depth and character. The diversity of rum styles ‚Äì from light and fruity to dark and spicy ‚Äì allows bartenders to create a wide range of cocktails,each with a unique flavor profile.

**Enhanced Sensory Experience:** Beyond taste, the best rums offer a complete sensory experience. the aroma, appearance, and even the feel of the liquid in the mouth contribute to overall enjoyment. A visually appealing rum, with a rich amber color, can be just as enticing as its taste.The aroma might evoke images of tropical landscapes, spice markets, or the inside of an aged barrel room.

**Investment Potential:** Certain limited-edition or rare rums can appreciate significantly in value over time. Bottles often produced in limited quanities by boutique distillers or autonomous bottlers can make for a strong addition to any connoisseur's spirits collection. While most rum drinkers prioritize taste and enjoyment, the potential for appreciation can add an extra layer of appeal for collectors.

## FAQs Section

**What are the different styles of rum?**

Rum is exceptionally diverse and can be catergorized into several types. Styles vary from White or Light rum, typically unaged or lightly aged and filtered, ideal for mixing; Golden or Amber rum, aged in oak barrels for a short period, offering more flavor complexity; Dark rum, aged longer in heavily charred barrels, resulting in a rich, molasses-driven flavor; Spiced rum, infused with spices like vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves; Rhum Agricole made from fresh sugarcane juice, showcasing grassy, vegetal notes; and Overproof rum, bottled above 100 proof (50% ABV)

**How should I store my bottle of rum?**

Ideally store in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and temperature fluctuations. Keep the bottle upright to prevent the spirit from interacting with the cork for extended periods. Once opened, reseal tightly to minimize evaporation and oxidation. Unlike wine, rum does not typically benefit from long-term aging in the bottle.

**What's the best way to enjoy a premium rum?**

Many enthusiasts prefer to enjoy premium rum neat, in a snifter or tulip-shaped glass, to appreciate its aroma and flavors. Others prefer it on the rocks,with a single large ice cube to chill the spirit without diluting it too quickly. Experiment to discover your preferences. consider adding a few drops of water to open up the aromas and flavors, especially with higher-proof rums.

**What food pairings work well with rum?**

The ideal food pairing depends on the style of rum. Light rums pair well with seafood, tropical fruit, and light desserts. Dark rums complement grilled meats, chocolate, and rich cheeses. Spiced rums enhance the flavors of spiced dishes, gingerbread, and apple pie. Experiment with different pairings to discover new flavor combinations.

My 1950s style ceramic electric kettle broke, I bought it in Germany 4 years ago. It‚Äôs not from any brand and I‚Äôm heart broken. I love my kitchen to remain Gothic/Retro style, I am allergic to plastic. I do have plastic household items but they‚Äôre not kitchen items I had to give my nutribullet to my partner because of my allergies.

Because life has its ways, my toaster is also not‚Ä¶ toasting. My bread is either burnt or cold but not toasted. 

I‚Äôm an avid tea and coffee drinker (I like my coffee either made with a drip or with a coffee press I don‚Äôt have space for a coffee machine). 
I can‚Äôt live without my kettle, the toaster I‚Äôve been using my stove and it‚Äôs great. 

But now that I need a new kettle, I‚Äôm also buying a toaster, so‚Ä¶ what should I buy ?
I love the smeg and kitchen aid ones but they‚Äôre wayyyy over my budget . 

My requirements are:

- they need to match in style, don‚Äôt need to be the same brand but need to look similar (like cousins or sisters);

- they need to be black, or black and white, if those colours aren‚Äôt available dark green is an option if it matches my stove;

- they can‚Äôt be plastic, I have PVC allergy; I prefer ceramic kettles for the aesthetics but steel is okay; 

- I live in Ireland, an UK plug is preferred but I am okay with buying an EU plug and changing it myself;

I believe that‚Äôs all, but since I‚Äôm already writing this, can I also have a recommendation on a good immersion blender ? It needs to be steel (allergies mentioned twice before I know), and work well to make smoothies, soups, and if it is strong enough to blend nuts and raw bones(I feed the foxes in my garden and my cat likes this stuff too) it‚Äôs a plus .

I remember being overwhelmed when I first got my Keurig, but trust me, it's actually super simple to use. I'll break down the whole process and share some tips I've learned along the way.

First, let's cover the basics. If you don't have a Keurig yet, you can check out the latest models here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers. They have different sizes and features, but the operating principle is the same for all of them.

Here's how to brew your perfect cup:

1. Fill the water reservoir with fresh, filtered water. This makes a huge difference in taste.

2. Insert your K-cup pod into the brewing chamber. Don't remove the foil lid - the machine punctures it automatically.

3. Choose your cup size (usually 6, 8, or 10 oz). I prefer 8 oz for the perfect balance of strength and volume.

4. Press brew and wait about a minute.

Some pro tips I've discovered:

- Run a water-only cycle before your first brew of the day
- Clean the needle regularly to prevent clogs
- Descale every 3-6 months depending on use
- Don't use the same K-cup twice

Common issues I've encountered:

- If your coffee is weak, try using a smaller cup size
- If it's not brewing, check if the needle needs cleaning
- If it's noisy, that usually means it needs descaling

Looking for a reliable Keurig machine? I've had great experiences with several models you can find here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

For maintenance, I descale mine every three months. It's really important for keeping your coffee tasting great and your machine running smoothly. I just use white vinegar or the Keurig descaling solution.

What I love most about my Keurig is how consistent it is. Every cup comes out the same way, and there's no mess to clean up. Plus, with the variety of K-cups available, everyone in my household can have their favorite blend.

After years of use, I can honestly say it's one of the most convenient additions to my kitchen. Whether you're a coffee newbie or a longtime enthusiast, a Keurig makes brewing coffee foolproof and quick.",1,1752842397.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False
1m318w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m318w1/should_your_coffee_table_match_your_sofa_or/,Should your coffee table match your sofa or contrast it?,"I recently spent weeks agonizing over whether my new coffee table should match or contrast with my sofa. After researching extensively and consulting with interior designers, I've learned there's no strict rule - it really depends on your space and style preferences.

From my experience, matching your coffee table with your sofa creates a cohesive, harmonious look. It's a safe choice that works well in traditional settings. I tried this approach in my previous apartment, pairing a brown leather sofa with a wooden table in a similar tone, and it looked pretty elegant.

However, I've discovered that contrasting pieces can add more visual interest and personality to a room. In my current living room, I chose a glass and metal coffee table to pair with my dark grey fabric sofa, and the contrast really makes both pieces stand out.

If you're looking for coffee tables, I found some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Here are some key points I've learned about choosing the right coffee table:

1. Consider your room's overall style
2. Think about functionality and storage needs
3. Pay attention to size and proportion
4. Factor in maintenance requirements
5. Look at the other furniture pieces in your space

The material of your coffee table plays a huge role too. Glass tables work great in small spaces as they create an illusion of more room. Wooden tables add warmth, while metal ones bring a modern touch.

When I was shopping, I found an amazing selection of coffee tables in different styles and materials here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

One important tip: regardless of whether you choose to match or contrast, make sure there's at least one element that ties your coffee table to the rest of your room's decor. This could be the style, texture, or even a subtle color detail.

In my living room makeover journey, I've learned that the most important thing is to choose pieces that you love and that serve your needs well. Whether you go for a matching or contrasting look, focus on creating a space that feels right to you.

Some practical advice: measure your space carefully, consider your lifestyle (do you need storage? do you have kids?), and think about how you'll use the table. This has helped me make better furniture choices overall.

Remember, interior design rules are more like guidelines. What matters most is creating a space that works for you and makes you feel at home.",1,1752842364.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1m318tu,https://i.redd.it/imznqal9omdf1.jpeg,Pressure build up [Sage Barista Express],"Hi everyone!

I have had this machine for a few weeks now, and I have noticed, that pressure indicator needle never goes beyond level you can see in the picture.

I was just performing cleaning cycle with cleaning tablet and silicon pad in the portafilter, and as you can see, presure goes to center of the scale and no more. As far as I know, the pressure should build up with the basket resistance; no resistance means no pressure, and max resistance means max pressure. Right now, with my silicon pad, there's no water drip down from portafilter, so there's max resistance and still half pressure.

Every YouTube video I saw on cleaning cycle the barista express shows indicator go to the very right.

Should I be worried? Does that mean my machine is malfunctioning? Does that affect coffee I make? Is there a solution for that?

Back in 2018/2019 I (then 20f) was dating my now ex (then 26m, lets call him Andrew) and he was the ULTIMATE mamasboy. 

Into the story:  My ex's father passed away when he was only 7. His brother, then 16, locked himself in his bedroom to mourn this loss, while their mother completely leaned on Andrew for emotional support. But, even years later, she continued to do this, and this made their relationship grow kinda toxic.
We started dating somewhere in 2018, and the first 2-3 months i didnt see too many red flags. He did still live at home at 26, while most teens move out at 18 in the country where i'm from, but his brother, 35, also still lived at home so i didnt think too much of it. MIL talked A LOT. Like she would ramble on about herself for 2hours during breakfast while i just wanted some coffee to start my day. But she was nice to me, so i didnt really mind. 

After a while, I started noticing some weird things... 
- When Andrew was younger, he was really overweight. Before i ever met hem, around 22, he decided to get healthy, go to the gym and lose A LOT of weight. He was always watching his food when i was around him, and he was proud to keep the weight off. But i started noticing his mom would practicly forcefeed him a lot of food when we would eat with her. She would say things like ''my baby needs to eat properly!'' and then proceed to give him extremely large portions (literally for 4 people). And him, laughing and smiling at her, eating it, eventhough he would later tell me he felt guilty for eating so much. 
- Andrews older brother was very rude towards their mom (i still dont know why). He was 35, still living at home, no job and would call his mother by her first name, which i found very disrespectful. Their relationship was the opposite of what she had with Andrew, and this made Andrew show his ''affection'' towards his mom even more. He liked the fact the he had ''the better relationship'' with his mommy. 
- One weekend, his mom and brother would be gone for the weekend, so he asked me to stay at his place, because we would have the house to ourselves. The FIRST thing he wanted to do at the start of this weekend...? Yeah: have s*x in his moms bed. Spoiler alert: we did. 
- For Christmas at his house we bought eachother gifts. That morning, before we swapped the gifts, he told me with the biggest smile on his face what he got his mom: a ‚Ç¨300 Pandora necklace with a charm that said: ''i Love you'' and he said he hoped she would cry when she received it. Spoiler alert: she did. Now im never the person to complain about a gift i receive, but he got me a GameOfThrones tshirt and he gave his mom... this?? That was moment i really realised, it was not just her constantly and emotionally leaning on him: he fed into it, and really enjoyed it.

About 6 months into dating he got an appartment for himself. He had talked a lot about wanting it, and i gladly helped him find a place. The day before he would move in, his mom insisted on throwing a small ''going away dinner'' with some friends and family. During the dinner she gave a very emotional speech, on how much she was going to miss him, and how ''this is the last time he is with us''; you'd think he was dying or something. He cried too, and hugged her in front of everyone for a solid 3 minutes. Guys, HE WAS MOVING 3 STREETS OVER, a literal less than 5 minute walk from his moms house. After moving out, he came over at least 4 days a week to have diner with his mom and brother.

About 3 months after this, we broke up. Even 6 years later, i still cringe thinking about the fact that he treated his mother like a GF and always tried to make her cry, like it was ultimate form of affection or something.
The list of weird things they both did and said to eachother is way longer, but these were definitely some of the highlights. 
Im so happy i never have to deal with their toxic mommy/baby relationship ever again. 

So yeah, thats the tea, i hope you guys enjoyed it :)

It uses the existing data connectors to grab content from your own web apps (SharePoint, Teams, Google Drive, Github etc..) to work with your tools.

But what does it mean for b2b marketing? Well in short EVERYTHING

*This post is aimed at marketing teams, departments or agencies (I run an agency focused on b2b marketing).*

ChatGPT Agent is the latest in a trend of AI products with 2 key features. First they have tools. That means they can do a bunch of different things (and they choose themselves when and how to use them). Two of these tools are searching the web and writing the code. These open up a huge number of sub capabilities. The second key feature is the ability to work for an extended period of time ""on their own"". Combined this means this sort of AI product can be given a fairly complex task and be left to do it. By go to example for b2b marketing.... putting together the monthly social media report for a wider team or the board. It normally looks a bit like this:

* Login to LinkedIn and note down the data in Word
* Do the same in X, or use a third party tool you connected to it
* Do the same in Instagram or any other platform you need
* You've already lost an hour
* Then login to Google Analytics to grab relevant website data
* This is an hour by itself, GA is a nightmare I think
* Then you've got a load of numbers, time to fight with PowerPoint to make a deck
* Spend 3hrs doing this, trying to keep it all on brand
* Finish and make coffee to celebrate
* Remember you have forgotten to add any insights, go back and do that
* You've spent all day on it now.
* Finish up by emailing it to the team, and wait for the 100 questions by return email

ChatGPT Agent can do this whole process for you.   


I have been testing it with this sort of task:

>""We are running an set of SEO emails in MailChimp, an automation. I think we have sent 5 of 10 or so. Can you review their performance and give me a slide I can present to the Leadership Team to show how they doing. They for leadgen ultimately, so any insights would be great.""

 **The results?**  

* The cover slide is terrible.  
* The data on slide 2 is correct though, they have pulled out the correct numbers.  
* And the accompanying text is helpful, if not super insightful.  
* But they haven't really given me any info on the leadgen aspect.   
* I can't use this internally, and certainly this isn't work fit for a client.   

But here is the rub. This new tech runs it's own computer, has access to any webapp I give it (and sign into), can write code, generate slides, use Excel, and operate on its own on complex tasks for 30-40mins. These slides took 19 minutes. 

So yes this is basic intern work right now. And it needs to be better. Yes it is slow. Yes it needs hand holding. 

But guess what? All real interns need that. And they are still out there in the real world doing valuable work. And so can ChatGPT Agent. 

And like a real intern it will get better at work, smarter and faster.

But unlike any human worker, soon it will get really really smart, really really fast, able to work 24/7, and never get tired or sick or complain.   It won't do it lightening quick right now. It will ask you for a nudge along the way, and the deck won't be perfect (but will be better than 50% of people who make terrible decks for a living). But it will work. And it can chug away in the background why you do something else.

And this is one use case. There are 100s of others:

* Drafting campaign performance reports from multiple platforms
* Updating buyer personas or ICP docs using CRM and call data
* Creating competitor intelligence summaries from online sources
* Rewriting landing pages for different personas
* Pulling proof points for case studies or sales pitches from internal docs

There is a lot of hype around AI (duh!) but one thing as far as I can see is 100% the WAY we work is changing. Normal office workers need to skill up and learn how and why they can command an army of agents to do 70% of their day to day, and what that means for their now free time?

Again this is NOT about AI replacing humans. This is about what humans will be capable of when equipped with AI. Look at your job now. List the 10 most tedious things you do every week in your project management tools, or CRM, or your timesheet, or reporting tasks. Fire up a couple of instances of ChatGPT Agent, and get back to doing something that really moves the needle in your role. ",3,1752842115.0,DigitalMarketing,3,1.0,False

It's not complicated, but there are a few tricks I've learned that make it easier and more effective.

First, let's talk about why cleaning your kettle is important. Over time, mineral deposits can build up inside, especially if you have hard water. This can affect the taste of your drinks and even reduce the efficiency of your kettle.

The simplest method I've found is using a mixture of white vinegar and water. I fill the kettle about halfway with equal parts vinegar and water, then let it sit for about an hour. After that, I boil the mixture and let it cool. Once it's cool, I pour it out and rinse the kettle thoroughly.

For tougher buildup, I sometimes need to use a soft brush to gently scrub the inside. Be careful not to scratch the surface, especially if your kettle has a non-stick coating.

If you're not a fan of the vinegar smell, lemon juice works well too. I've used both fresh lemon juice and the bottled kind with good results.

For the outside of the kettle, I just wipe it down with a damp cloth. If there are stubborn marks, a bit of dish soap usually does the trick.

One thing I've learned is to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. They can damage the kettle and potentially leave residues that could affect the taste of your drinks.

Regular cleaning is key. I try to do a quick rinse after each use and a deeper clean every few weeks, depending on how often I use the kettle.

If you're in the market for a new electric kettle, I recently came across a great selection at https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They have some models that are designed to be easy to clean, which can save you time and effort in the long run.

Remember, a clean kettle not only ensures better-tasting drinks but also helps your appliance last longer. It's a small task that makes a big difference in your daily cup of tea or coffee.",1,1752841947.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1m30we1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok-Quality4576/comments/1m30we1/how_ai_is_revolutionizing_work_efficiency_and/,How AI is Revolutionizing Work Efficiency and Speed in 2025,"As we navigate through 2025, artificial intelligence has become as commonplace in our workplaces as morning coffee and Monday meetings. Yet, unlike that familiar cup of joe, AI‚Äôs effects on our professional lives are far more complex and nuanced. While some herald it as the ultimate productivity booster, others warn of its potential pitfalls. The reality, as with most transformative technologies, lies somewhere in between.

**The Acceleration Revolution: How AI is Supercharging Workplace Efficiency**

The most immediate and tangible benefit of AI in the workplace is its ability to handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks with unprecedented speed. In 2025, we‚Äôre seeing AI systems that can process thousands of documents in minutes, analyze complex datasets in real-time, and generate initial drafts of reports faster than any human could type. This isn‚Äôt just about replacing manual labor; it‚Äôs about freeing up human cognitive resources for more strategic, creative work.

Consider how AI has revolutionized customer service operations. Chatbots now handle 80% of routine inquiries, allowing human agents to focus on complex problem-solving and relationship building. Similarly, in content creation, AI tools can generate first drafts, suggest improvements, and even optimize content for different audiences, transforming writers from creators to curators and editors.

The impact on internal communication has been particularly striking. AI-powered platforms now summarize lengthy email threads, schedule meetings based on everyone‚Äôs availability and preferences, and even translate messages in real-time for global teams. These systems have eliminated much of the administrative overhead that once bogged down collaborative work, allowing teams to focus on actual collaboration rather than coordination logistics.

**The Creative Catalyst: AI as ‚ÄúThe Storyteller‚Äù**

One of the most fascinating developments in 2025 is AI‚Äôs emergence as ‚Äú[the storyteller](https://www.ticworks.com/)‚Äù in business contexts. Beyond simple data analysis, AI systems now craft compelling narratives from raw information, helping organizations communicate complex insights to stakeholders. Marketing teams use AI to generate personalized content at scale, while executives rely on AI-generated executive summaries that don‚Äôt just present facts but weave them into coherent, actionable narratives.

This storytelling capability has proven invaluable in industries ranging from healthcare, where AI helps doctors explain complex diagnoses to patients, to finance, where AI transforms dense market data into accessible investment stories. The speed at which AI can generate these narratives has accelerated decision-making processes across organizations.

**The Productivity Paradox: When Speed Becomes a Trap**

However, the AI revolution isn‚Äôt without its shadows. The very speed that makes AI so attractive can become a double-edged sword. The pressure to match AI‚Äôs pace has led to what researchers call ‚Äúproductivity anxiety‚Äù ‚Äî a condition where workers feel constantly pressured to perform at machine-like efficiency levels.

Moreover, the rapid output of AI systems can overwhelm human decision-makers. When an AI can generate dozens of reports, hundreds of content pieces, or thousands of analysis points in a single day, the bottleneck shifts from creation to evaluation. Many organizations are discovering that having too much AI-generated content can be as problematic as having too little human-generated content.

**The Human Element: What We Lose in Translation**

Perhaps the most significant concern about AI‚Äôs impact on work efficiency is the potential erosion of human skills and intuition. As AI systems become more sophisticated, there‚Äôs a risk that workers may become overly dependent on these tools, leading to a decline in critical thinking and creative problem-solving abilities.

The phenomenon is already visible in various fields. Accountants who rely heavily on AI for analysis may lose their ability to spot anomalies that don‚Äôt fit algorithmic patterns. Writers who depend on AI for ideation might find their own creative muscles atrophying. Even in ‚Äú[internal communication](https://www.ticworks.com/services/internal-communications)‚Äù Over-reliance on AI mediators can reduce the authentic human connections that often drive innovation and team cohesion.

**The Quality vs. Quantity Dilemma**

AI‚Äôs ability to produce work at breakneck speed has created a new challenge: maintaining quality while maximizing quantity. While AI can generate content, analysis, and solutions faster than ever before, the nuanced judgment required to ensure quality often still requires human oversight. This has led to a new type of workflow where speed is balanced against the need for human verification and refinement.

Organizations are learning that the most effective approach isn‚Äôt to let AI run unchecked but to create hybrid workflows where AI handles the heavy lifting while humans provide strategic direction and quality control. This balance is crucial for maintaining both efficiency and excellence.

**The Skills Evolution: Adapting to an AI-Augmented Future**

The workforce of 2025 is rapidly adapting to this new reality. The most successful professionals are those who have learned to work alongside AI rather than compete against it. This means developing skills in AI prompt engineering, understanding how to effectively collaborate with AI systems, and maintaining the uniquely human abilities that AI cannot replicate ‚Äî such as emotional intelligence, creative thinking, and ethical judgment.

Training programs are evolving to focus on these hybrid skills. Companies are investing in ‚ÄúAI literacy‚Äù programs that teach employees not just how to use AI tools but how to think critically about AI outputs and maintain their own professional judgment.

**Looking Forward: The Sustainable AI Workplace**

As we progress through 2025, the key to harnessing AI‚Äôs benefits while avoiding its pitfalls lies in creating sustainable AI integration strategies. This means designing workflows that leverage AI‚Äôs speed and efficiency while preserving human creativity, intuition, and well-being.

The most successful organizations are those that view AI not as a replacement for human workers but as a powerful tool that can amplify human capabilities. They‚Äôre creating environments where AI handles routine tasks, freeing humans to focus on strategy, creativity, and relationship building ‚Äî the areas where human intelligence still reigns supreme.

The future of work efficiency isn‚Äôt about choosing between human and artificial intelligence; it‚Äôs about finding the optimal balance between speed and thoughtfulness, automation and creativity, efficiency and humanity. As we continue to navigate this AI-augmented workplace, the organizations and individuals who succeed will be those who can harness the power of AI while maintaining the essential human elements that drive innovation, empathy, and meaningful work.

In this new landscape, the question isn‚Äôt whether AI will continue to transform work efficiency and speed ‚Äî it‚Äôs how we‚Äôll shape that transformation to serve not just our productivity goals but our human values and aspirations as well.",1,1752841393.0,u_Ok-Quality4576,0,1.0,False

How do I survive this? üòÇ‚òï,"Okay so‚Ä¶ I (F, 21) matched with this guy on Tinder. We went on a date. It was fine! He was cute, sweet, a little awkward‚Äîbut in a good way. I fully meant to text him back.

But life got busy‚Ä¶ and I ghosted. üò≥ Like completely disappeared.

Now? He‚Äôs literally my new barista at the coffee shop I go to every other day. He smiles, he knows my order, but I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúprofessional smile‚Äù or ‚Äúomg you ghosted me and now I have to make you oat milk lattes for eternity‚Äù smile.

What do I do?

* Act like nothing happened and sip my coffee in shame forever?
* Tip him extra and pray for forgiveness?
* Or just straight up say ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ sorry I ghosted, wanna try again? I‚Äôm better at coffee than texting.‚Äù

After boiling water in the kettle to heat the cup & components, I was going to reboil the kettle just before filling the brew chamber. But I just remembered: reboiling water supposedly has a bad effect on its taste, at least so I read in one of the coffee forums some time back. Does anyone consider this an issue?
