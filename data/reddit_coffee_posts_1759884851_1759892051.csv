1o0z4mf,https://i.redd.it/m9w3jcoyxstf1.jpeg,Matt and Justus Fan Fiction,"Late at night, the studio was quiet. The only sound was the soft hum of the lights overhead and the faint drip of a faucet somewhere beyond the makeshift editing room. Matt sat cross-legged on the floor, laptop open, headphones around his neck. He was reviewing video cuts, but his attention kept drifting toward the doorway.

Justus appeared in the dim hallway light, holding two mugs of coffee. He stepped inside, the scent of brewed beans instantaneously filling the space.

“Still working?” Justus asked, voice low and gentle. He offered one mug to Matt and took the seat beside him, careful not to jostle the equipment.

Matt accepted the mug, their fingers brushing. It was just a second, but it made Matt’s heart skip.

“I couldn’t sleep,” Justus said. “Thought you might need a break.” He gestured toward the screen. “Let me help.”

Matt nodded, and they leaned in close, side by side. As they worked, they whispered back and forth — suggestions, jokes, laughter. The tension between them was quiet but electric, like two magnets drawn in spite of themselves.

When the footage was finally locked in, Matt closed the laptop and turned to Justus. His eyes were soft in the low light. “You know,” Matt said, voice husky, “I’m glad you stuck around.”

Justus reached out, placing his hand on Matt’s knee. “Me too,” he replied. “You’re… everything I didn’t know I was waiting for.”

The moment stretched. They leaned closer, nearly touching. Matt’s breath caught. Then Justus tilted his head, and their lips met—gentle, secret. The world outside the studio ceased to exist. For that single moment, there was only them.

Afterward, they stayed like that — foreheads resting, breaths mingling. Justus’ hand slid to Matt’s, fingers entwining. Matt pressed a soft kiss to Justus’ temple.

In the hush, they let themselves believe in what they wouldn’t yet speak aloud.

1o0z3ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1o0z3ww/paying_for_my_less_welloff_friend_when_were_out/,Paying for my less well-off friend when we’re out,"Me (20F) and my friend (20F) met our freshman year of college since we were randomly assigned roommates. We’ve been friends for 2 years now, and I just feel like the transactional (?) part of our friendship is not balanced. Whenever we’re at drive-thrus for coffee or at grocery stores, she asks me to pay for her stuff on my card so we can pay together and it’s “easier” and says she’ll pay me back, but never does. 

I don’t know if I’m cheap to be complaining about this because her stuff never exceeds $10 max, but it’s just the principle to me. She is almost never the one driving us around so I’m always the one paying at drive-thrus and after I pay it’s always “Do you want me to pay me back?” and never just “How much was mine?”. I’m kind of a people pleaser so that first question just feels like it’s implying that I shouldn’t need/want her to pay me back and I just end off saying no, but I don’t get why she has to frame the question that way. It’s also the fact that we both like taking occasional semi-long trips (2-3 hour round trip), but driving makes her anxious so I always drive, and idk is it not common courtesy to offer to buy the driver coffee or something OCCASIONALLY. I’m not going to keep track of how many miles I drove and ask for gas money every single time but…is that not just manners? How am I the one always driving and paying for both of our stuff 😭

She knows my family is a lot better off than hers, so I don’t know if she feels like it’s okay for me to constantly be paying for her stuff. I also don’t know if I just have no backbone and just need to talk to her about this, but I also feel stupid for bringing it up because she sometimes talks about how she’s had friends where she always paid for their meals and stuff even though they never paid her back. The question is, are some people just like this and take and take and don’t feel any shame or feel like they’re crossing any lines? Or am I just a bad friend for constantly thinking about times she hasn’t paid me back for stuff?",1,1759891808.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1o0z376,https://www.reddit.com/r/grief/comments/1o0z376/how_to_discuss_loss_and_grief/,How to discuss loss and grief?,"It’s been 6 months since I lost a friend. I’ve been processing this pretty healthily, but grief isn’t linear and it’s been rough this month. It still feels so recent, but the fact that it’s been half a year just hit me hard, like the external flow of time and my internal perception of time are mismatched, making me feel ungrounded. 

I want to talk about this with my friends. What’s the best way to approach conversations about loss and grief without turning it into trauma dumping? I don’t want to ambush them, and I want to respect their boundaries as well as their capacity in the moment to process stuff like this. At the same time, we’re all so busy and usually hang out while grabbing coffee or a meal, I don’t know how they would feel about handling heavy topics over food and drinks. 

It feels like there isn’t a right time to bring it up, and it’s frustrating because I trust my friend and know for sure they would be supportive if there was only the right opportunity to talk.

I’d appreciate any advice. Thank you.",1,1759891749.0,grief,0,1.0,False
1o0z31d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassF/comments/1o0z31d/zenos_history_06/,Zenos History- 06,"**Zenos**

I woke to the smell of stale cigarettes and frying oil and my mother’s voice sawing through the door like a rusted blade.

“Up, brat! You think the world will make room for your naps? Golden Capes don’t sleep till noon!”

It wasn’t noon. It was barely light. I rolled over and stared at the cracked paint on the ceiling, counting the hairline fractures like they were escape routes. Zula didn’t knock. She never knocked. The door banged open and she strode in with a pan in one hand and a cigarette in the other, like a war goddess who had replaced her spear with burnt eggs.

“You hear me?” she said, planting the pan on my desk. “Eat. Move. Or I’ll drag you by the ear like your good-for-nothing father.”

“Good morning to you too,” I muttered, sitting up. “Love the hospitality. Very uplifting.”

She squinted through smoke. “Sarcasm is for the weak. You want gold on your shoulders? Then suffer faster.”

I swung my legs out of bed, joints popping, and stood. Everything still ached from the last mission bruises stacked on bruises, the kind that blossom in sick colors. I pulled on my uniform while she paced and insulted the concept of idleness, Hugo’s knees, Melgor’s cowardice, and my alleged tendency to blink away from problems.

“I don’t blink away,” I said, mouth full of too-hot eggs. “I blink into worse ones.”

“Then blink into the kitchen when the dishes need washing.” She flicked ash at the sink and jabbed a finger at me. “And fix your stupid hair. You look like you lost a fight with a fan.”

“I did,” I said. “The fan won.”

She sniffed, the corner of her mouth betraying the smallest hint of a smile she’d deny under torture. “Eat faster.”

I shoveled the rest down and grabbed my gloves. The morning pressed at the window, the city a pale bruise beyond the grime. Zula stepped into my space and straightened my collar with the rough tenderness of someone who didn’t believe in tenderness.

“You’re walking like a corpse,” she said. “Hugo better beat the weakness out of you today.”

“He tries,” I said.

Her eyes softened in that dangerous, fleeting way. “Try back.”

I nodded. She flicked my forehead, hard. “Don’t get killed. Not before I can say ‘I told you so.’”

“Comforting,” I said.

I kissed her cheek anyway smoke, salt, and stubbornness and blinked. The apartment collapsed inward, the hallway stretched long as a throat, and the world flipped inside out as I stepped through the tear.

The Association unfolded beneath my feet: glass and steel, order polished to a cruel shine. I landed in a corridor washed with cold light and the metallic tang of disinfectant. The echoes of boots, the low hum of power dampeners in the walls, the banners that whispered promises I no longer fully believed. I breathed once, then again, and told myself I was stronger than yesterday. That I would keep moving. That gold was still a horizon, not a lie.

Zula’s voice chased me even here, like a warding spell. Don’t get killed. Try back.

I straightened my shoulders and went to find the only person who could out-grumble her and still make me feel steadier for it.

Hugo.

⸻

Hugo found me before I found him, because of course he did. He leaned against the training hall’s bulkhead like he’d grown out of it: scarred forearms folded, old eyes hard and amused. Today he wore the half-mended jacket that always smelled like oil and rain. His right hand was still flesh, but the skin there twitched in little ripples, promise of steel a thought away.

“You look like yesterday fell down the stairs and dragged you with it,” he said.

“Zula says hi,” I answered.

He grunted. “Tell her my knees hate her.”

“She’ll embroider that on a pillow.”

He jerked his chin toward the outer doors. “We’re up. Quick response. Red Zone trouble again. Different quadrant.” His mouth thinned. “They got heavy after last week.”

The words sank like stones. Last week: Russell, blood, cameras, applause. The noble district turned slaughterhouse while we posed as surgeons. “Media says we saved a thousand lives,” I said quietly.

“Media says a lot.” Hugo pushed off the wall. “We did what we did. They’re angrier now. More organized. Smarter.” He scratched the line of an old scar along his jaw. “And they’ve got two names worth remembering. Charles. Euder.”

“Powers?” I asked.

“Charles contact paralysis. Touches you and the lights go out in whatever he grabs. Not just numb dead electricity. Muscle dies by inches while you watch. If he gets your spine, you won’t feel the floor when it kisses you goodnight.”

My stomach went tight.

“Euder,” Hugo went on, voice flat, “is worse in slow motion. Says he makes ‘surgical threads.’ Not real. You won’t see them, you’ll just feel them. He perforates. Micro-punctures, precise. Collapses a lung from ten meters. Unzips a smile from ear to ear without lifting a finger. Likes to reshape people.” He paused. “Smiles while he works.”

“Charming,” I said, because if I didn’t say something, the quiet would dig into bone.

“We’re not alone.” Hugo nodded past me. A man in clean silver stepped up, young, eager, sharp around the edges the way we all are before the world files us down. Matheus. I’d seen him in passing, leading drills with the neatness of a ledger.

“Zenos,” he said, offering a hand I didn’t take because habits. He didn’t flinch. “I’ll coordinate. We have three civilian clusters in harm’s way. We block, we peel, we extract. No hero plays. Understood?”

“Understood,” I said.

“Russell coming?” he asked, tone carefully neutral.

“Not today,” Hugo said. Relief hid in the words like a sigh with a blade between its teeth. “Just us.”

Matheus breathed easier. “Good. He turns extractions into executions.”

No one argued. It hung between us: the memory of teeth on stone, laughter in blood. I thought of Sônia’s window and the city like a chessboard, of words about evolution and the weak being devoured, of Almair weighing lives in his palm like coins. I thought of gold, still burning my periphery like a sun I couldn’t stare into without going blind.

“Targets?” I asked.

“Shanty strip along the old viaduct,” Matheus said, sliding a tablet my way. Blue dots pulsed: civilians huddled in cinderblock alleys, a clinic with a flickering sign, a school with barred windows. Red triangulations like wounds: Charles. Euder. “We go in quiet, break their spear, drag people out before the gangs realize we don’t have numbers.”

“We never have numbers,” Hugo said. “We have decisions.”

Matheus looked at me. “Your teleport—can you move groups?”

“Short jumps,” I said. “If they hold on and don’t panic.”

“They’ll panic,” Hugo said. “Make them do it anyway.”

The klaxon on the wall flared, a low moan that warns more than it commands. Matheus sealed the tablet to his wrist. “We’re late,” he said simply. “Zenos?”

I nodded. The familiar dread slid cold under my ribs. The familiar stubbornness answered it. I stepped in close; Hugo’s hand found my shoulder, Matheus’s fingers gripped the fabric at my collarbone. The world gathered itself like a fist.

“Take us there,” Hugo said.

I closed my eyes and cut the city open.

⸻

We dropped into heat and stink and sirens—under the old viaduct where the city forgets its own bones. Concrete pillars rose like dead trees, painted with names and warnings and saints with hollow eyes. Smoke crawled along the ceiling in a low, ugly river. Somewhere a dog howled and didn’t stop.

Gunfire cracked three streets over. Screams stitched the gaps. The wind wasn’t wind; it was breath from hundreds of lungs pulling panic in and pushing it out, trying to stay alive.

Matheus went low and moved fast, two fingers to his ear, voice clipped. “Team Echo, where are my markers? We’re blind without the drones.”

Static answered. Then a voice, thin with fear: “Drone two down. Drone three… I—” The line cut. A second voice whispered a prayer hot with poor reception.

“Change of plan,” Hugo said. His right arm rippled into a wide shield studded with blunt teeth. His left hand stiffened into a short cleaver made for work, not theater. “We make our own markers.”

We slid along a cinderblock wall. A door opened boy no older than ten, hair stuck to his forehead, eyes too large in a face too thin. He stared at our capes like ghosts.

“Back inside,” Matheus whispered, steady palm pushing gently, pressure precise. “Under the bed. Stay. Do not open for any man with a badge unless his left shoulder is patched blue.” He pointed at his own patch. The boy nodded too fast and disappeared into dark.

The alley spat us onto a wider cut of street where the viaduct spit lumps of broken concrete. Three civilians hunched behind a tipped refrigerator; a woman pressed a towel to an old man’s thigh, red soaking through like the sea climbing sand. A teenager with a cracked skateboard held a kitchen knife and didn’t know where to put his eyes.

“Matheus,” I said, already stepping.

“I see them,” he said. “Move.”

I blinked to the far side of the street. The world snapped; my stomach lurched; I touched the man’s shoulder. “Hold on to me,” I told him, but he was drifting, drowning behind his eyes. The teenager grabbed my sleeve. The woman didn’t ask permission; she clutched my belt, jaw set like the world owed her breath.

I blinked again and they spilled into the alley where we’d come, tumbling into shadow. “Blue patch,” I shouted at the doorway where the boy’s eyes gleamed. “Only blue patch!”

He nodded, knuckles white on the frame.

Hugo covered us, shield swallowing a spray of bullets that sparked and screamed. He answered with a cough of metal the stubby barrel he’d grown along the shield’s rim spitting three cruel barks. The gunmen folded like cheap chairs.

Matheus dragged a trash bin to fortify the alley mouth. “Two more clusters,” he said. “Clinic east school north. We split—”

“Negative,” Hugo said before he finished. “Charles and Euder hunt in pairs, and we haven’t seen them. We stay a fist, not fingers.”

A sound like metal sighing bled down the street. It took me a heartbeat to realize it was the viaduct itself humming, not with trucks but with something meaner. The hairs on my arms lifted.

“They’re close,” Matheus said. “Zenos—”

“On you,” I said.

We moved. Under a mural of a mother with eight arms and a halo of nails, past a burning scooter, past a girl sitting on a curb hugging a cat that had decided not to run. The clinic’s sign a tooth painted like a cartoon flickered and died as we arrived. Inside: old tiles, older disinfectant, metal cabinets with braces and crutches and desperate hope.

A nurse with silver in her hair and red in her eyes pointed at three bunk beds shoved along a wall. “Children,” she said, breath hitching. “I can carry two.”

“You’ll carry none,” Hugo said. “You’ll guide.” He turned to me. “You’re the door. Open it.”

They pressed in: soft hair, shaking shoulders, hot cheeks wet with tears that didn’t make a sound. I split the distance, the world bending wrong as I took ten at a time in short, ugly jumps: clinic to alley, alley to a safer stairwell we’d marked with chalk, back again. I tasted bile and kept moving. Matheus counted, steered, placed bodies where they wouldn’t be crushed when panic stampeded.

On the third shuttle, the clinic’s front window sighed inward. Not shattered—sliced. A crisp rectangle lowered itself from empty air and set gently on the floor like a platter at a party.

A man stepped through the hole he’d made.

Tall. Hair cropped short. Skin the color of coffee with too much milk. Hands clean. Smile neat and unhurried, as if he’d kept us waiting and was pleased to do so.

“Euder,” Hugo said, and his voice did a thing I didn’t like.

Euder’s fingers twitched in invisible thread. The nurse made a small sound and touched her cheek. When her hand came away, blood laced her fingers like thin red stitching.

“Hello,” Euder said, voice soft as a clinic’s waiting room. “No need to run. We’re just here to rearrange.”

And then another shadow moved at his back, quiet as dust. Charles. He didn’t smile. He didn’t need to. He flexed his fingers like a pianist about to begin.

I blinked toward the children and missed. The room reeked of alcohol and fear and something thin and metallic I would later learn to call micro-bleed. Hugo stepped into the doorway, shield wide, body low.

“Matheus,” he said, without looking. “Close ranks.”

Matheus swallowed. “On me.”

The first needle we didn’t see opened my knuckle like a zipper. The second stole the nurse’s breath. The third wrote my name along my ribs in tiny punctures that promised a story I would not like.

I bared my teeth. “On me,” I said—and tore the world again.

⸻

If you ask me later what I remember first, it isn’t the blood. It’s the way the clinic’s fluorescent lights trembled in their housings, buzzing like trapped wasps, as if the room knew we were about to teach it a new noun for fear.

I blinked hard, fast, dragging three kids and the silver-haired nurse into the alley and shoving them toward the chalked stairwell where a dozen survivors huddled with a tin crucifix and a broken mop for courage. “Blue patch!” I shouted again, voice frayed. “Blue patch, blue patch, blue patch—”

I turned back and blinked into the clinic as Euder stepped forward like a man coming to the counter to order tea.

“Do you know,” he said conversationally, “how many holes a lung can carry before it forgets to float?”

Hugo didn’t answer. He drove his shield into the man’s chest with a noise like a car kissing a wall. Euder slid backward, shoes squealing against tile and then the shield bled. Not red. It bled shavings of itself, tiny curls of steel falling from its face as if someone had peeled them with invisible hands.

“Craftsmanship,” Euder murmured, admiring Hugo’s arm like a butcher admiring marbling. “Let’s improve it.”

Hugo swore and reformed the edge, jaw clenched so hard the muscles in his neck stood double. He lunged again, cleaver hand flashing. The air between them filled with a soft, obscene sound like fabric tearing.

Matheus went for Charles. Wrong choice, right necessity. Charles moved like gravity—inevitable, close, more force than speed. Matheus feinted left; Charles let him; Matheus pivoted and drove a short baton at the man’s ribs, clean as a drill.

Charles caught his forearm.

It wasn’t dramatic. No crack, no scream. Matheus’s face just changed. A freeze, a confusion, a dawning horror as his right hand forgot it had ever learned to close. The baton slid from his fingers and clattered to tile. Charles’s other hand found Matheus’s shoulder. He pressed gently as a father might adjust a son’s jacket before a photograph.

Matheus’s shoulder died. You could see it: how the muscle slackened and surrendered in a circle under Charles’s palm, a flower closing the wrong way. Matheus tried to pull free. His right leg didn’t listen.

I blinked to them and grabbed Matheus’s collar. Charles’s fingers scraped my wrist a brush, a kiss, nothing and my thumb went out. The sensation didn’t travel; it colonized. It crept. I felt the map of my own hand go dark in neat territories.

I yanked anyway and blinked us two meters left. We reappeared among toppled trays and clean gauze spilled like snow. Matheus gasped, sweat springing from his face in an instant. “I can’t my arm Zenos—”

“I know,” I said, fighting the urge to shake feeling back into my own hand like that ever helps. “Stay behind me. Stay—”

A thread kissed my cheek. I didn’t see it; I felt the after. Warmth bloomed in a thin line and fell in a drop that landed hot on my lip. I tasted metal. Euder’s smile widened by a millimeter.

“Lines,” he said. “We are all lines waiting to be drawn.”

Hugo charged him, and for a heartbeat the old man was a cathedral of murder: shield high, edge low, stance perfect despite the crooked knee and the thousand aches. He took three steps through an invisible rain of holes and made his own door, cleaver biting for Euder’s throat.

A sound like wind through reeds. Hugo’s left bicep opened in neat, round dots, spaced like lesson marks. His cleaver faltered. Euder’s hand flicked twice like a conductor calling the violins.

Hugo’s left arm came apart.

Not off. Apart. You could see the architecture of him the fibers, the artificial anchorings, the seams where steel met meat and watch as Euder outlined it all in absence. Hugo’s mouth filled with a noise I’d only heard once before, when a man realized the fire would have him no matter how fast he ran.

He dropped to one knee and punched his shield forward, last act of a stubborn saint. Euder stepped sideways, patient, and wrote a circle through the air with two fingers.

Hugo’s throat blossomed.

I moved without deciding. The world tore. I was behind Euder, above him, anywhere but where I’d been. My boot found the back of his knee and folded it. My hand—my failing hand—clawed for his eyes.

He didn’t even look at me. His palm brushed air.

My forearm lit with a constellation of holes so small you’d need a fresh sin to see them. The muscle spasmed. My grip failed.

“Not yet,” Euder said, mild. “I’ve only started with you.”

Behind him, Hugo tried to stand. He did it the way he did everything: contrary to common sense. He convinced his body it would obey because he refused the alternative. He got half his weight under him and levered the shield up again.

Charles arrived.

He put one hand on Hugo’s spine and the other on the back of Hugo’s skull and pushed, not hard. Hugo arched. For a moment I thought Charles would snap him. He didn’t. He just held on the way you hold a door shut against a draft.

Hugo went still. The change ran down him like frost on a window—back first, then shoulders, then the cords of his neck, then his jaw. His eyes found me through the mask of a man whose body had forgotten him.

“Boy,” he said around the failing hinge of his mouth. “Run.”

“I won’t,” I said, because my throat was a box of nails and none of them would let a different word out.

“Stupid,” he said, almost fond. It came out slurred. “Good.”

Euder drew two more lines in the air. They were barely gestures; they were verdicts. Hugo’s shield slumped. The cleaver slid from a hand that was a memory. He folded to the floor like a church closing.

A sound hit the clinic window. High. Wet. Wrong. I turned and should not have. Matheus—Matheus—had bought the schoolchildren four minutes with a map and a tone of voice you trust in fire. He’d herded them down a back hall and into a storeroom and stacked boxes where bullets might think twice.

He didn’t make it to the fourth minute.

Charles found him by the door, arms wide as if he could be big enough to block vengeance with his chest. Charles touched his sternum. Matheus looked offended for a second and then realized he’d forgotten how to breathe. He took a step and his legs answered in another language. Charles guided him down against the jamb like setting a heavy book on a shelf.

Euder flicked. Matheus’s left eye watered red. He blinked against it like a man swatting a mosquito. Euder drew another small circle and the red became too much to blink.

“Stop,” I heard myself say, too human, useless.

“Why?” Euder said without turning. “We’re improving him.”

Something broke in my voice. A bad sound. A boy sound. I hated it. I loved what it confessed. I grabbed the world again ugly, split-second, blind and threw myself at them with the only power I had that didn’t need room to land.

Charles let go of Matheus and caught me by the jaw.

Just fingertips along the angle of bone, like a lover. Darkness sizzled into my tongue. I tried to blink and found that the part of me that makes that trick true had been turned off like a switch. Paralysis isn’t pain. It’s subtraction. It is the terrible lesson that your will is not a god.

Euder stepped close, curious, delighted. “So many lines,” he murmured, eyes tracing my face like a cartographer mapping a coast. “Let’s see where they lead.”

He wrote in the air again and something opened along my thigh—no dramatic slice, just the sudden knowledge that blood could be warm and cold at once. I would have fallen if Charles’s grip had not taught my legs a new obedience. I couldn’t tell if I was shaking. I couldn’t tell if my heart was fast or refusing like everything else.

Behind them, the nurse gathered a child who had come back because children are brave in all the wrong ways. She put her body between tiny bones and incoming ruin. This is heroism nobody films. Euder filleted her courage with a single, precise gesture that laced her shoulder to her ribs with holes like a stitched confession. She didn’t drop the child. She just learned a new way to hurt.

“Enough,” I croaked, because words were the only piece of me that still remembered me. “Take me. Leave them.”

“Tempting,” Euder said. “But I haven’t finished your friend.”

Matheus found one last pocket of himself that wasn’t broken and used it to spit blood and say, “Zenos, don’t—”

Charles pressed his palm to Matheus’s throat.

The light in Matheus’s eyes didn’t go out all at once. It guttered like a candle in a room where the window won’t latch. He stayed there too long, staring at me, trying to hand me a duty I didn’t deserve and couldn’t refuse. Then he slid sideways and the doorframe took him gently like an old tree receiving a bird.

I made a sound I never want anyone I love to hear. Charles watched me make it. There was no joy in him; there was only the certainty of a tool in a hand that knows the job.

“Your turn,” Euder said, and lifted his hand to draw lines I would carry for the rest of my life.

The world did not slow. It did not break into inspiring pieces. It pressed its full weight onto my chest and asked me whether I meant what I had told my mother and my father and my lover and myself. Whether I would try back.

I could not move.

So I did the only thing left to me.

I remembered.

Hugo’s barked laugh in the training hall. Zula’s smoke-bitten kiss to the cheek. Elis’s fingers crooked in mine like a promise. The boy in the doorway clutching courage in a small palm. The nurse refusing to drop a child. The way a city sounds when it still believes it might be worth saving.

“Gold,” I said through a mouth that wasn’t sure it could be mine. “You can keep it.”

Euder’s eyebrows lifted, amused. “We intend to.”

He drew the next line.

Everything after that was blood and steam and sirens, and the taste of grief like coins under my tongue.",1,1759891737.0,ClassF,0,1.0,False

1o0z214,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0z214,Printago's Etsy Integration Preview,"Hi everyone! I'm Matt, one of the co-founders of Printago, and I'm really excited to give you a sneak peek at what we're submitting to Etsy for review in just a few days!

# What It Does

* **Connect to your Etsy account** and Printago will check for new orders every 5 minutes.
* **Orders automatically go into your queue** and configure themselves with the correct color and personalization options (for OpenSCAD models!)
* Our **SKU Options/Parameters system** means you *don't* need a separate SKU for every color or variant of a model. You can keep a listing-level single SKU, and let the variants map into Printago. Set once, and done.
* **Personalization and sizing options** pass directly to OpenSCAD parts for automatic on-demand rendering. Great for personalized objects! This includes our support for multi-color **ColorSCAD** files for automatic painting!
* **Import SKUs** from your Etsy account into Printago (you'll need to add parts to them and configure the SKUs once).
* **Export SKUs** from your Printago account to Etsy! We use your draft listings as templates. If you need to add 50 cookie cutters that are all configured the same in Etsy, just make a draft listing with stock videos and pictures that will be the same in each listing, as well as the description. Additional per-SKU description will be put at the beginning of the description. The new Etsy listing will remain in draft state where you can upload photos and then publish! Store sections, pricing, variants - all set.
* **Etsy Export to CSV** (coming soon) - Need to export your Etsy listings to Shopify? Just choose a section of your store and export it. It will export a Shopify-compatible file ready to upload to Shopify. Already existing listings just get updated when you re-upload the file to Shopify.

# Pricing

The cost for the add-on is planned at **$20/month**, and that covers the first $1,000 of orders that flow through our system. After you make $1,000 each month, we'll charge 2% of the additional transactions (e.g., if you make $1,500 in November, you'd pay $20 + 2% of $500 = $10).

**We're not charging per API call** like many other services do - we think that's super lame.

# Our Evolving Pricing Strategy

As we move towards features that are coupled with e-commerce, we'll be slowly deprioritizing the ""per slot"" cost of Printago. We already allow unlimited printers to be connected for free, however our strategy has been to charge for ""production slots"" that represent the number of jobs we'll run from the Printago queue at a time for you. But that still punishes users for growing their farms.

As we roll out these add-on features, our plan is to offer a **""cap"" on the cost of the core service**, regardless of the number of printers you have connected!

We're working hard on the next set of features to continue to make Printago the most powerful and useful print farm software in the market. **Made for Businesses!**  As usual you can find me and my co-founder on our Discord server pretty much 24/7 ready to help anyone get started or take feature requests!",1,1759891651.0,BambuP1S,0,1.0,False

Rent’s insane, groceries somehow doubled, and I still end up broke even when I barely go out. So I started paying closer attention to where my money was going, and a few small changes actually helped a lot.

Here’s what’s been working for me lately:

1. Track where your money leaks.  
Not in some fancy Excel sheet, just write it down for a week. I realised half my money was disappearing into snacks, coffee, and random Uber rides. Once you actually see it, you’ll start adjusting naturally.

2. Automate the boring stuff.  
Rent, savings, bills, anything that can be on autopay, put it there. I used to forget payments all the time and end up stressed. Now it’s just one less thing to think about.

3. Don’t sleep on student discounts.  
Spotify, Notion, Apple, Adobe, Amazon, they all have them. Feels small in the moment, but saving $5–10 here and there adds up to a few hundred a year.

4. Be smart with shared costs.  
If you split rent, groceries, or takeout with friends, track it properly. “I’ll Venmo you later” can turn into a small debt pile real quick.

5. Learn a couple easy meals and rotate them.  
You don’t need to meal prep like a pro. I just learned a few cheap meals I don’t hate, pasta, burrito bowls, breakfast wraps, and rotate them through the week. Saves me at least $80–100 a month on takeout.

6. Save something, even if it’s tiny.  
I started with $10 a week. It’s not the amount that matters, it’s the habit. Once it becomes routine, it gets way easier to scale up.

7. Say no sometimes.  
The biggest budget killer is social pressure. Every “come on, it’s just one drink” adds up. Most people are secretly broke too, they just hide it better.

8. Learn the basics about credit and interest.  
Understanding how credit works, what utilisation means, and why minimum payments trap you, that’s real adult power. Start early, even if it feels boring now.

You don’t need to be rich to feel in control. You just need to stop money from slipping away without realising it. Once you get a few small systems in place, the stress goes way down.",1,1759891585.0,budget,0,1.0,False

1o0z0rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o0z0rj/everybody_loves_a_happy_family/,EvErYbody loVeS A HapPy fAmIlY,"Have you ever had an experience that is so visceral and surreal that it follows you every day for the rest of your life? One that makes you second guess or hesitate to do anything that may put you in the same situation? If you haven't already guessed, I have.

I was very down on my luck at the time, no job, no family, and subsequently, no home. My days consisted of moving around, being as I was homeless at the time, I didn't stay in one spot for very long. I'd had a nasty break up with my then-girlfriend and left with nothing more than a backpack with some clothes and a blanket. I didn't even have a phone.

One particular day I decided to move on to yet another town, yet I had no specific destination. I simply picked a direction and carried on my way. I found myself walking along some back roads that took me further and further into bum fucked nowhere, with only the occasional wooded areas ever couple of miles on either side of the road. I wasn't even sure how long I'd been walking, but night fell and the road in front of me was getting dark.

Any source of light was obstructed by thick storm clouds that made it difficult to navigate. There was no telling how far the nearest civilization was, and if that wasn't bad enough it soon started pouring rain. I pulled my hood over my head and trudged through it. I'd begun to worry that I'd be walking for several hours before reaching any semblance of shelter. I hadn't seen a car pass for I don't know how long.

I kept pace as fast as possible until I came across what looked to be a house that I spotted through a clearing of thick trees. I contemplated for a moment, not sure what to do. Eventually I decided it would be best if I tried to see if I could hunker down, at least until the rain dissipated. The house was pretty far back into the trees down a narrow dirt road. As I approached, I saw that the one-story house seemed old and run down. I noticed the shutters on the windows were closed.

I reached the porch and knocked, to be honest I was a little nervous about who I might encounter out in the middle of nowhere, where basically anything could happen. There was no answer, so I knocked again. I waited for a couple minutes before hesitantly turning the knob.

As I entered, I was met with the smell of stale air and it was pitch black. ""Hello?"" I called out. ""Anyone home?"" Silence... I felt along the wall until I found a light switch, though nothing happened when I flipped it. I shut the door to keep the rain out and let my eyes adjust to the room. I squinted through the darkness, surveying the living room, it was rectangular in structure.

To the far left sat a small couch with an armchair across from it, separated by a coffee table. Across from me was a doorway leading to what I presumed to be the kitchen, and directly to my right was a coat rack. Aside from the furniture, the rest of the living room only consisted of a bookcase, and photos that hung loosely from the walls.

Hoping that maybe the electricity was only briefly knocked out by the storm I searched for a breaker box. In the kitchen was a door that led to a basement. The only other door was the back door, which was boarded up as well. ""Great."" I thought. ""The breaker box would be in a creepy basement of a house that was tailor made for horror movies.""

I cautiously descended the creaky stairs as I struggled to find my footing in the darkness. The basement was filled with random boxes as far as I could see, along with a few baskets full of clothes. I spotted the breaker box and tried to flip it. To my disappointment nothing happened. I sighed, gathering that no one has lived here for a while. I found it odd, however, that it seemed as though most of the occupants' belongings were left behind.

I climbed the stairs once more returning to the living room. The storm outside raged on as I contemplated where to sleep. I found one of the bedrooms and peered in. Everything appeared normal, save for the fact that it seemed like nobody had slept here for some time. The bed was made, and family photos decorated the walls.

The open closet revealed clothes still hanging up. It was so difficult to see because even the windows in this room were boarded up from the inside. I felt a bit strange about sleeping in someone else's bed so I decided to sleep on the couch. I laid down listening to the rain until I eventually drifted off.

Do you ever have times in which something wakes you up but it takes you a while to realize what it was? Well that's what happened to me, not to mention forgetting where I was. I looked around, again waiting for my eyes to adjust. I noticed the rain had mellowed out some but that wasn't it. As I squinted around the room I noticed something out of place. I couldn't tell you why I even noticed. The coat rack.

That's when I noticed the breathing. My eyes scanned their way to the chair across from me. My blood turned to ice. I could see the form of what I initially believed to be that of a coat rack sitting directly across from me, leaning forward in the chair, only mere feet from my face. He wore an old hat, though I couldn't make out any details of his face.

I was paralyzed with fear. My breathing was shaky despite my attempt to keep calm, his own raspy breathing stopped as he must have noticed my awareness. His head slowly turned to the side. That was all it took. I jumped up and scrambled for the door, nearly falling. I pulled on the door to no avail, looking closely I saw padlocks on the door that I hadn't noticed before.

In my current state of panic I made a break for the basement, being that all other windows and doors were boarded up. I nearly tumbled down the stairs after slamming the door behind me. I stood with my hands clasped tightly around the doorknob, holding it closed. I listened for any movement and soon heard footsteps creeping slowly toward the door.

The floor creaked beneath his feet as he stopped at the door. The only sound I could hear over my own breathing was that of the man on the other side of the door. His breathing was slow and raspy, and almost animalistic. I stood holding the door for what seemed like forever, listening to the breathing. I was waiting for the moment that whoever was on the other side would force his way in. I thought he'd never leave until I heard the footsteps of the man as he walked away.

Moments later I heard the sound of a lock being undone, and the sound of the front door opening and closing. After a few minutes of silence I let go of the door, I hadn't realized I'd been gripping the doorknob so tightly my hand was sore. I was still to paranoid to open the door, so I decided I needed to find something, anything that I could defend myself with.

I made my way back down the steps and started rummaging through the basement, I listened carefully for any movement upstairs. I'd just about given up when my foot had hit something. I reached down, fumbling in the darkness until I found a flashlight. I thought I would feel some relief when I turned it on, but once I scanned the basement with it I found something that made me sick.

At first, when the light illuminated the laundry baskets, I had no clue what I was looking at. I approached slowly, and what I saw, my eyes refused to believe. Flesh, all of which was treated, as if it were leather. I tried to convince myself it was that of animals as I took a closer look, until I noticed the faces. Human faces, several of them amidst various other skins from who knows how many people. That wasn't all, I found something else, rested on a metal chair next to the baskets was a yellow notepad.

My mind was racing, it told me I should just focus on a way out and never look back but my curiosity got the best of me given the circumstances. I picked up the notepad and read the first page.

""We ask only to be reassured about the noises in the cellar and the window that should not have been open."" It read.

I flipped to the next page.

""One need not be a chamber to be haunted. One need not be a house. The brain has corridors surpassing material place.""

I kept flipping pages.

""Stare at the dark too long and you will eventually see what isn’t there.""

""Maybe all the schemes of the devil were nothing compared to what man could think up.""

""I don’t live in darkness, darkness lives in me.""

On and on it went, each page containing macabre phrases, most of which stained with smears of what seemed to be dried blood. I decided then that I had to get the fuck out of this God-forsaken house by any means necessary.

I still hadn't heard anything since the man left the house, so I put the notepad aside and crept back up the stairs, careful not to make too much noise. Slowly I opened the basement door and peeked out. Although I saw nothing moving, I was still cautious to say the least. I made my way through the kitchen and into the living room. Without hesitating I pulled the door open. My stomach dropped.

As I aimed the flashlight directly in front of me I saw a face I would never forget. His skin was withered and pale. His wild eyes were grey and almost unnaturally wide. He was sickly thin, wearing clothes much too big for him that were stained with what was most likely blood. His hair was tangled and matted. The man's mouth hung open revealing rotted teeth. For a moment I couldn't move, the cold, emotionless expression he wore was paralyzing. The eyes were so distant and yet I felt as if they were digging their way into my soul.

I slowly started to back up, and as I did so I saw the man's open mouth turn into a frown, and his blank expression turned into an angry grimace, as if he were disgusted beyond measure. I turned and ran to the first door I saw. As I reached the bedroom once u I heard the footsteps of the man behind me, his breath turning into a desperate growl.

I barreled into the room and was barely able to shut the door behind me before he slammed into it. I quickly reached for the knob and locked it. I kept my back to the door as I listened to his raspy breathing, after a few attempts at opening the door, he stopped. Then suddenly he broke out into a maniacal laughter, rambling incomprehensible gibberish. I had to find a way out as soon as possible.

As I turned the light toward the window that was boarded up, something caught my eye. The pictures. The families in the photos, and I mean different families in each picture that adorned the wall, were all mutilated and made to pose in different ways. Faces were forced into bloody, toothless smiles with hooks through their cheeks. Eyes were removed. Bodies were sewn together in a horrific embrace resembling a hug. Mouths were sewn to one another as if they were kissing.

Then as I moved the light toward the closet, I made yet another horrific discovery. Like the laundry hampers in the basement, in which were what I assumed to be nothing more than clothes, I found even more human flesh. Entire torsos of people were hanging from the rack, also seemingly treated as if it were leather. I felt sick. The whole situation was beyond anything I'd ever expect to experience. All the while the man continued to laugh and ramble unintelligibly.

""What do you want?"" I shouted breathlessly. The laughter stopped suddenly. I listened intently, hearing only the raspy breathing of the man. ""Just a happy family, I love to see a happy family."" he said in a low, animated voice. Then suddenly he proceeded to kick at the door, every loud bang was accompanied by a screeching bellow.

I knew if I didn't act quickly, I'd be killed, and likely turned into the casual apparel of a fucking sadist. To the left of the door was an armoire, with a surge of adrenaline i strained to push it in front of the door, tipping it over in the process. The scenery before me was almost too gruesome for my mind to make sense of it as one of the armoire doors swung open upon hitting the doorknob. Multiple severed human heads cascaded out onto the floor, all of them were maimed, and disfigured.

It was only the will to survive that drove me into a frenzy. I scrambled to the barricaded bedroom window and began driving my foot into it as the man continued to do the same to the door. I kicked and kicked with everything I had until the wood finally gave way. I tore away at the boards until I had full access to the window. To my dismay I found that it was also nailed shut. The crazed lunatic on the other side of the bedroom door seemed to be growing more frantic, and his shouting grew more hysterical.

Without thinking twice I grabbed the end table next to the bed and heaved it at the window. After two tries the window gave way with a satisfying shatter. Adrenaline still rushed through my veins as I climbed out and wasted no time sprinting into the direction of the trees. Moments after I took off running I heard the sound of the man bursting from the front door, and the maniacal laughter as I ran. I could only assume he didn't give chase as the chaotic sounds faded behind me.

I ran until my legs were on fire, until my blood turned to acid, and then I ran some more. I don't know how long I'd been running until I finally reached a road. Almost out of pure luck I spotted a car traveling by. I stepped into the middle of the road waving both hands like a lunatic as the car approached. I breathlessly told the driver that I needed the police. ""Call... Police... People... Murdered..."" Was all I could choke out. Luckily he obliged.

I did my best to explain to the cops exactly what happened in detail. Of course they were a bit skeptical, a sweaty, homeless drifter giving them a story about a murder situation undreamed of by even the most seasoned of homicide detectives. I was taken to the nearby police department to give a formal statement. I told them of the notepad, the human leather garments, and gave the description of the man I'd seen.

Then the unthinkable happened. I was told that not only was the man nowhere to be found, but that the house itself was empty save for the furniture. The hampers were gone, the closets were empty, the armoire contained nothing at all, nor were there any disfigured family photos or severed heads. It was assumed by the police that the occupants that lived there had simply picked up and moved, leaving most of their belongings behind.

I tried to convince them, but I was told that if I didn't want to be charged with falsifying a police report and destruction of property that I'd better just leave immediately. As discouraged as I was I didn't want to push my luck, since I was especially lucky to make it out of there.

Months went by and I'd actually started to find a foothold in my life again despite the psychological trauma I'd faced. In fact it seemed to give me a fresh outlook on life. I actually reconnected with my ex, and eventually rekindled our relationship. I started a decent paying job, and proposed, and was surprised soon after to find out that my wife was pregnant. With our newfound stability, we decided it was time to move being that she was going to pop any day, and we needed a bigger house. We found a house out in the country that was a perfect fit, closer to my job, and far away from the shit that haunted me. Things were going great.

After we were completely moved, we had a little housewarming party and invited some friends. I spent most of the time at the grill, having a few beers and laughs with the guys. My wife stayed inside with the woman doing the things that woman do when they congregate. I caught myself spacing out for a moment, thinking of my experience, I never talked about it to anyone except my wife.

""Hey babe, do you know where the photo album is?"" Sabrina asked, bringing me back to the present.

""Umm... Not sure love, honestly the last time I've seen it was at the apartment, didn't you pack it?"" I responded.

""No... I thought you did."" She said curtly. I shook my head with a sigh. ""Last I saw it was a couple weeks before we moved.""

""Damn."" She grumbled. ""They wanted to see the ultrasound. And it gives me an excuse to show them your baby pictures and stuff."" She gave me a devious grin.

"" Well God forbid that would be missing. "" I laughed. ""Anyways, it might turn up somewhere.""

The guests stayed around for a couple more hours before it was time to wrap it up and go home. The rest of the night was spent relaxing in front of the tv until Sabrina fell asleep in my arms, so I shut the lights off and headed for bed. I felt like things were going perfectly, which isn't something I'm accustomed to. It seemed as though I was starting to adapt since the incident, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't fuck with me from time to time, especially in my dreams.

The next day I woke up relatively early and couldn't fall back asleep. I had a few hours before work so I sat on the couch in front of the tv, drinking my morning coffee. I didn't like sitting idly. Once the memories creep in I become restless and try to occupy my mind with anything. I noticed the sound of rain as I sat fixated on nothing in particular, and it brought me back to that night.

I stood and made my way to the front door and stepped out, taking in the scenery of the grey sky, reliving that night in my mind. Above all else I felt like I was at the point that maybe I could move on from my experience one step at a time. That was until I turned around to go back inside. I noticed something resting against the house next to the front door.

It was a backpack... A very familiar one. I reached out a shaky hand with trepidation, picking up the bag. Walking slowly, I carried it inside I dropped it on the couch. I could only stare at it for several moments before I finally gathered the nerve to look inside. As I slowly unzipped the bag, I don't know what I expected to find, I just felt it was going to bring me back to the panic I felt in that hellhole of a house.

As I peered in, to my surprise I only found the clothes I had packed in it when I was traveling. That was until I spotted something else. I pulled out a very familiar large binder, that was formed into a photo album. I felt bile rise up in my throat as I opened it, each and every page displayed all of the family photos that it had always contained, only every one of them had what seemed to be blood smeared in the form of a smiley face covering them. Parents, grandparents, siblings, nephews, nieces, cousins, aunts, and uncles.

I kept flipping, and flipping pages, until I came to the last and final photo. My heart lurched in my chest. The ultrasound. Blood was stained upon it in a smile like the rest. On the page to the right of it was a ripped-out page from a yellow notepad. In unmistakable handwriting it read ""Planning on adding to the family? So am I.""

And beneath that it read ""Everyone wants a happy family.""",1,1759891549.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1o0yzoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurantowners/comments/1o0yzoy/outsource_bookkeeping/,Outsource Bookkeeping?,"I’m wondering, is there a size or type of restaurant where you think doing your own bookkeeping would be practical and sensible, as opposed to hiring a bookkeeping service?

One of my friends works for a very good bookkeeping company, they do many of the restaurants in town, so I have access to that service.  But it isn’t cheap either - I’m not saying their service isn’t worth every penny, but it’s a non-trivial number of pennies.

We’re looking at starting a small cafe - only about 700 sf public space, a couple steps up from a “coffee shop” but very modest compared to the full-fat restaurants that you guys/gals have.

I have my own business, it is in financial services and very simple in an inflow/outflow sense.  I’ve always done my own bookkeeping, click through Quicken putting every expense in its category, it is pretty easy.  But again, it is a simple business.  Maybe it wouldn’t be as easy to bookkeep a cafe.

What do you think?

What information are you trying to extract from your books?  What analyses do you run?  How often are you running those numbers - daily, weekly?  How many different expensive and income categories do you need to track?  If you do your own books, how many hours/week does it take?  How have you made it as automated as possible?

# Pricing

The cost for the add-on is planned at **$20/month**, and that covers the first $1,000 of orders that flow through our system. After you make $1,000 each month, we'll charge 2% of the additional transactions (e.g., if you make $1,500 in November, you'd pay $20 + 2% of $500 = $10).

**We're not charging per API call** like many other services do - we think that's super lame.

# Our Evolving Pricing Strategy

As we move towards features that are coupled with e-commerce, we'll be slowly deprioritizing the ""per slot"" cost of Printago. We already allow unlimited printers to be connected for free, however our strategy has been to charge for ""production slots"" that represent the number of jobs we'll run from the Printago queue at a time for you. But that still punishes users for growing their farms.

As we roll out these add-on features, our plan is to offer a **""cap"" on the cost of the core service**, regardless of the number of printers you have connected!

We're working hard on the next set of features to continue to make Printago the most powerful and useful print farm software in the market. **Made for Businesses!**  As usual you can find me and my co-founder on our Discord server pretty much 24/7 ready to help anyone get started or take feature requests!",0,1759891375.0,3Dprinting,0,0.5,False

But Saturday I was practicing guitar, a little AC/DC, Rage Against The Machine, and others and when I finished Judas Priest’s Breaking The Law, it pinged. Hey, this could work for manager’s song. Maybe :)

I always remember being decently popular and being like the go to kid. I didn’t dissociate because my friends unironically helped me cope. I had girl friends who would go to foot ball games with me, that I’d go on excursions with. Sometimes we’d go on coffee dates.

With my guy friends we’d party, meet people, smoke weed, and drive fast cars. They would go like 130-160 mph. They would love rapping, and even taught me how to rap. We would crash over at peoples houses, and through these people I met my first GF. She was a complete stoner and actually really funny. Hahaha I remember we’d leave school just to get high and eat out. I remember going to new school and having kids already know me which was kinda weird and cool. They’d be like, we’ve heard you did some crazy stuff at the other school. It was almost like a movie. 

Then I went to prom with this girl I loved talking to after I broke up with my ex. She still calls me to this day. My friends and I never talked about religion or politics which was really nice. Then I finished high school and it all changed.

~ i twink died, and age pill fucked me up. I finally stopped repping and came out as trans. That’s after I realized this shit doesn’t go away ( thanks to speaking to elder trans folks… I lost my best friend because I came out as trans. He also stopped talking to me because of drugs. My friends all came out as deep MAGA republicans. I realized that in order to pass I gotta skinny max and surgery max which deteriorated my mental health. My dad started drinking heavily. I started to have to pay 1000’s of dollars in medical bills to transition thanks to unstable levels and labs. I discovered 4tran4 and my mental health deteriorated more ( thanks to me realizing the reality of my situation). I realized my life ahead of me will be hard unless I pass. 

Positives: I met some people on 4tran4 that has had shared experiences. I finally got to express myself and be more of me, even if I’m downlow. My mom and dad accept me in some capacity. My medical bills are all paid for. I finally went to LGBTQ events. My Insurance has covered my gender affirming care. I started to realize that this stuff takes time. So while I wait, I can doom on 4tran and talk to you ❤️. I got fat so I’m hoping by loosing weight I’ll discover if I twink died or not. ",2,1759891340.0,4tran4,0,1.0,False

1o0yvqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1o0yvqy/i_need_some_tips_please/,I need some tips please,"Hey, a bit about me: I'm 35, I have clinical depression and have been taking medication for roughly the last year and I've been working backshift for the last 5. Recently, my sleep has severely declined to the point where I'm missing a lot of work because I'm dozing off on the way into work. I'm terrified my wife is going to wake up in the morning and either A) find me in a ditch or B) wake up to me in the hospital/dead. I've recently started sleeping pills (troloxodone or something,) and so far, no good. I'm supposed to take 1-3 a night, but the pharmacist said to start with half where I've never taken any sleep aids before. I've tried half, and I've tried a full pill. Neither did anything. Not even an extra half hour of sleep. I've reduced caffeine and energy drink intake. At one point I was drinking 3-5 coffees a day plus 2-3 energy drinks. Now I might drink 1-2 coffees a day and 1-2 energy drinks depending. Though, tbh, I haven't noticed much difference in anything since cutting back. 

Now, we have a lot going on at the house involving renovations, and she's pregnant finally after years of trying, so this could simply be stress induced. I don't feel stressed over either of those though. Tbh, the only thing I feel stressed about is my lack of sleep. I like to blame backshift and depression, but over the five years I've been working, it's never been *this* bad. I have had bad bouts of depression, but lack of sleep like this has never been an issue. 

I'm honestly at my wits end here and I don't know what to do. ShouldI keep increasing my dose of meds until I hit three pills or just say to hell with it and skip two? Skipping a pill and going to the max seems like a bad idea. I loathe the idea of taking sleeping pills because I'm terrified that if I hit a bad bout of depression I may try to OD. When I mentioned that to the Dr, they said this medicine does act as an antidepressant and should help in that regard too. 

I don't know if this is true insomnia or what, but any tips you guys could throw my way would be greatly appreciated.  ",1,1759891133.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

1o0ytu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1o0ytu0/102_大爆炸_big_bang/,10.2 大爆炸 Big Bang,"一天下午，我忽然感觉肚子疼，怀疑大佛印那帮人（敌对势力）要杀我灭口，指使我同事在我喝的咖啡里下毒。我去警察局报警，警察看着我说，都没记录，没什么反应。我离开了警察局，想去医院；可我知道在医院排队看病要等十几个小时，实在是难熬，就回家了。

我一直想我和刘团长之间的事，认为自从2004年，他就没再来逗我玩了。我串联起了整个第2章《桃花劫》的故事（注，但还没有回忆出第1至3章的事），认为自己想明白了 “前世姻缘，命中注定” 这八个字。我一直对佛教的不见顶智（即上帝之眼）着迷，没想到刘团长用在我身上了。我觉得自己是个畜生，他那么大岁数了，快病死了，三番两次托人捎信让我去看他，而我像个活驴一样，无动于衷；自作孽，不可活！

One afternoon, I suddenly felt a stomach-ache and suspected that Dufferin gang (hostile forces) wanted to kill me and instruct my colleagues to poison my coffee. I went to the police station to report the case, but the police looked at me while I was talking; there is no record, no response. I left the police station and wanted to go to the hospital, but I knew that I would have to wait for more than ten hours to see a doctor in the hospital, which was unbearable, so I went home.

I have been thinking about what happened between me and Troupe Leader Liu, and I think he has not come to tease me since 2004. I have linked together the story of the entire Chapter 2 ""Peach Blossom Catastrophe"" (note, but I have not yet recalled the events of Chapters 1 to 3), and I think I have figured out the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. I have always been fascinated by the Buddhist “intelligence of not seeing the top” (i.e. God's Eye), but I didn't expect Troupe Leader Liu to use it on me. I feel like a beast. He is so old and dying of illness. He repeatedly asked people to send me messages to visit him, but I was like a donkey, indifferent, self-inflicted sin, not deserving to live!

**10.2-1 肠梗阻 Ileus**

忽然，我感觉五脏六腑都在移动，身体里到处都是邪气乱窜。我小时候练过气功（参见第12章），对这种肢体的触觉幻觉不感觉奇怪，但这邪气发动的规模之大，程度之剧烈，让我震惊。我赶忙躺到了床上，以免晕倒。

我感觉到胸下出现一个隔截面（如插图10.2.1-A），上下不通气，胃肠不走动（注，现代医学称为肠梗阻）。我立刻调整呼吸，驱动真气沿着任脉向下冲击那个中截面。真气一接触那道截面，截面就溃散了。很快，那些邪气又变形重组，堵在胸口处（约在膳中穴，俗称中丹田）。我继续调整呼吸，用真气沿着任脉向下冲击堵在心窝处沉重阴冷的邪气。几分钟后，我打通了任脉，身体和胃肠的蠕动恢复了正常。我镇静下来后，心想：一时悸动，还真没遇见过；可不能再胡思乱想了！

Suddenly, I felt my internal organs moving, and “ill air” were running all over my body. I had practiced meditation when I was a child (see chapter 12), so I didn't find this kind of tactile hallucination strange, but the scale and intensity of the “ill air” shocked me. I quickly lay down on the bed to avoid fainting fall.

I felt a diaphragm section appear under my chest (as shown in Illustration 10.2.1-A), with no air circulation and gastrointestinal tract movement (note, this is called intestinal obstruction in modern medicine). I immediately adjusted my breathing and drove “True Air” down along the Ren Mai to impact the middle section. As soon as the “True Air” touched the section, the section collapsed. Soon, the “Ill Air” reshaped and reorganized, blocking the chest (about the Shan Zhong acupoint, commonly known as the middle Dantian). I continued to adjust my breathing and used the Qi (i.e., True Air) down along the Ren Mai to impact the heavy and cold evil Qi (i.e., Ill Air) blocking my chest. After a few minutes, I opened the Ren Mai, my body and the peristalsis of stomach returned to normal. After I calmed down, I thought to myself: I have never experienced such a temporary palpitation before; I can't let my imagination run wild!

**10.2-2 大爆炸 Big Bang**

过了一会儿，我不介意刚才发生的事了，又开始自责：我可真不是个东西，这不是人干的事儿。突然，我又感觉全身都有异动，赶忙平躺在床上了，全身的肉都有轻微的凹凸跳动的现象。凹凸跳动的现象有些加剧了。从命门穴（后腰两肾处），各发射出一股电弧的感觉沿着体表皮肤，像似水纹一样扩散；两股电弧在前腹处相撞了。接着，全身都有大小多个电圈套着肢体和整个身体上下移动，像似在做CT检查扫描一样，但我在经历的是多个电圈上下移动扫描我的身体。两只胳臂和两条腿分别有多个小电圈在上下移动扫描。突然，全身各处涌起气伴随着电流，以比读秒快几倍的速度，向丹田（如插图10.2.1-B）汇集。聚集在丹田后，立刻就爆炸了。随着爆炸，那些碎片气扩散到了全身各处。

After a while, I stopped caring about what happened and started to blame myself again: I am a piece of shit, this is not what a human being does. Suddenly, I felt something moving all over my body, and I quickly lay flat on the bed. My flesh was slightly bumpy and pulsating. The bumpy and pulsating phenomenon was a little more severe. From the Ming Men acupoint (the two kidneys in the lower back), a feeling of electric arcs was emitted along the skin surface, spreading like water ripples; the two arcs collided in the front abdomen. Then, there were multiple large and small electric circles all over my body, which were wrapped around my limbs and my entire body, moving up and down, just like a CT scan, but I was experiencing multiple electric circles moving up and down to scan my body. There were multiple small electric circles moving up and down on my two arms and two legs. Suddenly, Qi (i.e., Air) surged from all parts of my body, accompanied by electric currents, and gathered towards Dantian (as shown in illustration 10.2.1-B) at a speed several times faster than the countdown. After gathering in Dantian, it immediately exploded. With the explosion, the fragmented Qi (i.e., air) spread to all parts of my body.

我高幸地想：哎呀！大爆炸，百脉震开！我小时候在气功书上看过这种现象的描写，会百脉皆开。可是，正在发生的事情和传说的不一样。几秒后，整个身躯，包括脸部的肉都有明显的凹凸式上下跳动的现象，像似沸腾了着的水面；我的全身各处都在沸腾和震动。我对自己说：“镇静！沉住气！别慌！” 全身凸凹跳动的现象持续了几秒后，渐渐地平息了。这时我在床上平躺着，关注着全身各处的异动。

散布在全身各处的气变得清凉，随着流动在数百处小范围内聚集，并伴有电流、阴冷、凸凹地跳动的病气（或邪气）的感觉。我意识到了这不是好现象！不是书里描写的舒服，凉爽。我感觉那些迷走性风湿气中几十股大的，不走经脉，而是径直地走向心脏，一边移动一边还在汇集。有几股迷走性风湿气移动得很快，比如说，厘米每秒。

I thought happily: Oh my! Big explosion, all sutras (i.e., the lines in the acupuncture chart, see figs. 10.2.1) are shaken open! When I was a child, I read the description of this phenomenon in a meditation book, that all the sutras will be opened. However, what was happening was different from the legend. After a few seconds, the whole body, including the flesh on my face, had a clear bumpy up and down phenomenon, like the boiling water surface; my whole body was boiling and vibrating. I said to myself: ""Calm down! Keep calm! Don't panic!"" The bumpy and jumping phenomenon of the whole body continued for a few seconds, and gradually subsided. At this time, I was lying flat on the bed, paying attention to the abnormal movements of various parts of my body.

The air that was scattered all over the body became cool, and as it flowed, it gathered in hundreds of small areas, accompanied by the feeling of electric current, coldness, and uneven beating of diseased air (or evil air). I realized that this was not a good phenomenon! It was not the comfortable and cool feeling described in the book. I felt that dozens of large vagal rheumatic airs did not go through the sutras, but went straight to my heart, gathering as they moved. Some vagal rheumatic airs moved very fast, for example, centimeters per second.

我立刻紧张了，如果迷走性风湿气侵入心脏；心脏就是一团肌肉，若是这样怪异地颤抖，那不就是心肌梗塞吗！我小时候，听奶奶说过多次。她一次生气后，在外面树荫下睡着了。半梦半醒之间，她感觉像似有一股气流进了心脏。从那时起，她就患了心脏病。

保卫心脏，我立刻行动起来了，别的器官都管不了了。我开始用真气对离心脏近且移动速度快的迷走性风湿气进行攻击。好在，那些邪气流都很脆弱，一被真气碰到，就散了。很短的时间内，我就击溃了十几股迷走性风湿气流团。这时我发现，几股主要的风湿气移动得慢了，大部分风湿气不移动了。我镇静了下来。

I immediately became nervous. If the vagal rheumatic air invaded the heart, and the heart is a mass of muscle, if it trembled strangely like this, wouldn't it be a myocardial infarction!? I was having a Heart Attack! When I was a child, I heard my grandmother talk about these many times. Once she was angry and fell asleep under the shade of a tree outside. Between half asleep and half awake, she felt as if a stream of air entered her heart. From then on, she suffered from heart disease.

I immediately took action to protect my heart, ignoring other organs. I began to use my “true air” to attack the “vagal rheumatic air” that was close to my heart and moved quickly. Fortunately, those “evil airs” were very fragile, and they dispersed once they were touched by my “true air”. In a short period of time, I defeated more than a dozen “vagal rheumatic air” groups. At this time, I found that several major rheumatic airs moved slowly, and most of the rheumatic airs did not move. I calmed down.

**注10.2.2 Note 10.2.2**

插图10.2.1-2源自古墨西哥，表明古代的美洲有和中国类似的真气理论（即针灸和气功理论，参见第12章）。插图10.2.1-4是公元七世纪，帕卡尔王（Lord Pacal，亦作金童，特拉洛克，狮子王））的灵棺盖板，刻画了他堕入地狱的前因后果。图上部显示十字架或金刚剑插入了帕卡尔王的腹部，表示他被十字架钉住了，病危了。图底部他的狮子头正处于一个火匣子里，表示帕卡尔王堕入了 “火途” （即地狱，精神病）。火匣子上面是他的神父的棺材，表示帕卡尔王是被 “他神父过世” 的信息打入地狱的。棺材里是空的，只留下了尸体爆炸后遗留下来的三块儿残渣（即三块佛骨舍利，人骨），表明帕卡尔王听到他神父过世的消息后，体内发生了爆炸，所以他堕入了地狱，即患了精神病。棺材上面显示，一根射精的阴茎可以提起棺材，表示帕卡尔王和翠玉女（即玉女）的事实婚姻是治疗他的疾病的正确方法，可以使他脱离地狱。

Illustration 10.2.1-2 originated from ancient Mexico, indicating that ancient American had a similar theory of “true air” (i.e. acupuncture and meditation theory; cf. chapter 12) as Chinese. Illustration 10.2.1-4 is the coffin cover of Lord Pacal (aka. Gold Boy, Tlaloc, Jaguar) in the seventh century CE, depicting the cause and effect of his falling into hell. The upper part of the picture shows a cross or “philosopher-stone sword” inserted into his abdomen, indicating that he was crucified, was critically ill. At the bottom of the picture, his lion head is in a fire box, indicating that King Pakal fell into the ""fire path"" (i.e. hell, mental illness). Above the fire box is his godfather's coffin, indicating that King Pakal was sent to hell by the information that ""his godfather had passed away"". The coffin is empty, leaving only three pieces of residue left after the corpse exploded (i.e. three pieces of Buddha's bones, human bones), indicating that King Pakal's body exploded after hearing the news of his godfather's death, so he fell into hell, that is, he suffered from mental illness. The coffin is shown with an ejaculating penis that can lift the coffin, indicating that King Pakal's de facto marriage with Chalchiuhtlicue (aka. Jade Girl) is the right way to cure his illness and save him from hell.

**10.2-3 我投降了 I surrendered.**

我对刘团长对我做过什么感到迷惑；但我和他的矛盾是我不同意他的 “我卢岩是刘健君的丈夫” 的决定（参见8.2节《死不瞑目》）。我真气已经很少了（注，聚集和运送真气需要大量的体力和时间），可这时的我全身都是风湿气。我已经处于面对死亡的状态，投降了。

我跪在床上发誓： “刘健君是我的妻子；刘团长是我岳父；我会去追求她并和她结婚。” 我不断地叨咕着： “刘健君她爸是我的岳父，刘健君是我的媳妇。” 我知道誓言对人的思想有很强的统摄作用。这样出声地叨咕，有助于我集中思想和精力，对不让松散意识抵触和破坏我的主意识，消除心理矛盾大有好处。

I was confused about what Troupe Leader Liu had done to me; but the conflict between me and him was that I disagreed with his decision that ""I, Luyan, is Eve Liu's husband"" (cf. v. 8.2 ""Die with Eyes Open""). I had very little “true air” left (note, gathering and transporting “true air” requires a lot of physical strength and time), but my whole body was full of rheumatism. I was already facing death, surrendered.

I knelt on the bed and swore: ""Eve Liu is my wife; Troupe Leader Liu is my father-in-law; I will pursue her and marry her."" I kept muttering: ""Eve Liu's father is my father-in-law; Eve Liu is my wife."" I know that oaths have a strong control over people's thoughts. Mumbling out loud like this helps me concentrate my thoughts and energy and is very helpful in preventing loose consciousness from conflicting and destroying my main consciousness and eliminating psychological contradictions.

我找出了我收藏的针灸经脉图。真气在经脉里会走得快，通畅和增强。我先在经脉图上筹划运气的路线，和打击风湿症的最短和最有力的角度，再运气发功对风湿症病处进行攻击。又击碎了几团风湿症后，我发现迷走性风湿症移动的速度变得更慢了。我沿着手少阴心经（如插图10.2.1-C）运气；用真气把心脏包裹了起来。这样，弱的迷走性风湿症不会有机会靠近心脏。

I found the acupuncture sutra map I collected. The “true air” will move faster, smoother and stronger in the sutras. I first planned the route of “true air” flow on the sutra map, the shortest and most powerful angle to hit the rheumatism, then used “true air” to attack the rheumatism. After breaking up a few more clusters of rheumatism, I found that the vagal rheumatism moved slower. I moved “true air” along the “Shou Shao Yin heart sutra” (as shown in Figure 10.2.1-C), wrapped my heart with “true airs”. In this way, the weak vagal rheumatism would not have the opportunity to get close to my heart.

这时，我认为自己必须吃好睡好，保持健康，才能与全身的迷走性风湿症对抗。如果我的身体健康变差了，就可能什么时候患了风湿性心脏病，死不了也成了废人。我向妻子和孩子做了生死离别，没明说，她们也不懂。我害怕睡梦里自己不知道保护心脏，所以睡觉前，洗了热水澡来平衡全身的体温，以减少做梦。我躺在床上，调息收敛思想，然后熄灭了前意识，把心身的控制权交给了无意识（古作神识）（参考案例1.4.2《井阳之灾》）。佛经上说，这种状态，人的愈合力极强，等同神佛。

At this time, I thought that I must eat well, sleep well, and stay healthy to fight against the vagal rheumatism in my body. If my physical health deteriorated, I might develop rheumatic heart disease at some point, and I would become a disabled person even if I didn't die. I said goodbye to my wife and children, but I didn't say it clearly, they didn't understand. I was afraid that I didn't know to protect my heart in my dreams, so before going to bed, I took a hot bath to balance the body temperature and reduce dreaming. I lay in bed, regulating my breathing and concentrating my intention, then extinguished the preconscious and handed over the control of the mind and body to the unconscious (anciently known as God-sense; reference case 1.4.2 Well-Sun Catastrophe). The Buddhist scriptures say that in this state, people have extremely strong healing power, equivalent to Gods and Buddhas.

**注10.2.3 Note 10.2.3**

前面三小节描述的病症在现代的医学中称作皈依失调（Conversion Disorder；如图10.2.3-1所示），是一种罕见的精神疾病。在随后几年与风湿症对抗的过程中，我不断地研究，现在认为此病是这样产生的。我从小就敬畏刘团长，想拜他为师（是一种连自己都不清楚知道的向往），第8章中，遇到刘健君后，更是对刘团长有了深刻的爱恨情仇。随后，我和刘团长的爱恨情仇又持续发展了六年，但我没见过他，所以在我的幻境中他就是一团白色迷雾。那迷雾是现量（参见11.4.5 识蕴 Sense Node），代表刘团长，是我对刘团长全部感情的和记忆的依附标的物。当我意识到他已经过世了，这信息被我的无意识（古作神识）接收到后，那团迷雾就消失了，因为无意识只处理现量，而刘团长不再是现量了。这样，我对刘团长的全部感情和记忆就失去了所依附的标的物，就引起了大混乱，产生了前文的“皈依失调症”。

The symptoms described in the previous three sections are called Conversion Disorder in modern medicine (as shown in Figure 10.2.3-1), which is a rare mental illness. In the process of fighting rheumatism in the following years, I continued to study and now believe that this disease is caused by this. I have been in awe of Troupe Leader Liu since I was a child and wanted to worship him as my teacher (a yearning that I don’t even know myself). In Chapter 8, after meeting Eve Liu, I had a deep “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu. Subsequently, my “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu continued to develop for another six years, but I never met him, so in my mind he was a ball of white mist. The mist is the “Present Quantity” (see 11.4.5 Sense Node), representing Troupe Leader Liu, and is the object of my attachment to all my feelings and memories of Troupe Leader Liu. When I realized that he had passed away, this information was received by my unconsciousness (anciently known as God-sense), the ball of mist disappeared, because the unconscious only processes “Present Quantity”, and Troupe Leader Liu is no longer the “Present Quantity”. In this way, all my feelings and memories towards Troupe Leader Liu lost their attachment, which caused great confusion and resulted in the ""conversion disorder"" mentioned above.

前面三小节描述的病症是癔症（古作鬼病）中的一种极端现象，称作圣鬼。插图10.2.3-2源自古墨西哥，是一位堕入地狱期间的特拉洛克（即金童）。雕像顶部是古墨西哥人对圣鬼的表述。雕像的正面，圣鬼正用许多代表迷走性风湿症的阴茎攻击特拉洛克。阴茎代表产生特拉洛克体内迷走性风湿症的原因是他和翠玉女（即玉女）的婚姻纠纷。插图10.2.3-3是佛教中的金刚降魔杵；其中（4）（8）（9）的顶端部是代表圣鬼的雕塑。圣鬼的本质是惭愧；面对刘团长，我总是惭愧，是罪人。

前面三小节描述 “死不瞑目”诅咒在我身上爆发的现象。后来我发现那和西方人所说的 “三个不可饶恕的诅咒” 的意义相同，知道了西方人所说的三个不可饶恕诅咒， “立毙咒，钻心咒，和夺魂咒” 正是对死不瞑目诅咒所产生的现象的描述。

The illness described in the previous three sections is an extreme form of Hysteria (anciently known as Ghost Illness), called the Holy Ghost. Illustration 10.2.3-2 is from ancient Mexico and is a Tlaloc (Gold Boy) who was in hell. The top of the statue is the ancient Mexican representation of the Holy Ghost. On the front of the statue, the Holy Ghost is attacking Tlaloc with many penises representing vagal rheumatism. The penises represent that the cause of vagal rheumatism in Tlaloc is his marriage dispute with Chalchiuhtlicue (Jade Girl). Illustration 10.2.3-3 is the “Philosopher-Stone Pestle” in Buddhism; the top of (4), (8), and (9) are sculptures representing the Holy Ghost. The essence of the Holy Ghost is shame; in front of Troupe Leader Liu, I always feel ashamed and am a sinner.

The first three sections describe the phenomena of the ""Die with Eyes Open"" curse erupting in me. Later I found that it had the same meaning as the ""three unforgivable curses"" mentioned by Westerners. I learned that the three unforgivable curses mentioned by Westerners, ""Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus”, are exactly the descriptions of the phenomena caused by the “Die with Eyes Open”.

**10.1 刘团长的死讯 News of Liu’s Death**

二零一一年五月，我到高德联合公司（Golder Associates Inc.）的实验室工作。高德是家上市了的国际性岩土工程公司。我只在实验室里工作，不下工地，接触的人少。实验室的经理玛丽的名字很长，我不能拼读。在面试我时，她同意我称呼她玛丽（Mary）。她来自一个我不知道在哪里的国家。她再次解释；我还是想不出来，就不好意思再问了。工作一段时间后，我发现人们称呼她玛丽亚、罗密欧什么的，再次问应该怎么称呼她。她回答她的生活里就这样，不同的人叫她不同的名字，习惯了。我常观察她，她是个标准健壮的欧洲血统白人，行为端庄得体，传统西方人的世界观，性格不紧不慢，没有地方口音，没有民族和地域的特质；我分析不出她来自何方。

开始的两个月还好，可工作中，我又接触到了达弗罗克（Davroc）和大佛印（Dufferin）公司的人和业务，渐渐的我的觉思失调症又成长起来了。我和同事之间有了矛盾，对黑社会的担心越来越重。刘健君研究灵魂转世，雇佣黑社会的人，黑社会的人办事不成，丢了面子，或者什么人矜持不住了，就可能出现谋杀事件。

In May 2011, I went to work in the laboratory of Golder Associates Inc. Golder is a publicly traded international geotechnical engineering firm. I only worked in the lab, not went to the job site, had little contact with people. The lab manager, Mary, had a long name that I couldn't spell. When I was interviewed, she agreed to let me call her Mary. She was from a country I didn't know where. She explained again; I still couldn't figure it out, so I was too embarrassed to ask again. After working for a while, I realized that people called her Maria, Mario, or whatever, and again asked what I should call her. She replied that that was how it was in her life; different people called her different names and got used to it. I often observe her. She is a standard, strong white woman of European descent. She behaves in a dignified and proper manner, has a traditional Western worldview, a leisurely personality, no local accent, and no ethnic or regional characteristics. I cannot analyze where she is from.

The first two months were fine, but at work, I met people and business from Davroc and Dufferin, and gradually my schizophrenia worsened. I had conflicts with my colleagues, and I became more and more worried about the black society. Eve Liu studied soul reincarnation and hired black society people. If those mafias failed to get tasks done, lost face, or someone lost their composure, there might be murders.

**10.1-2**

一天的喝咖啡休息时间，听同事们在唠嗑。事后，不知为什么，我回忆起了玛丽讲她开会时看的录像。刘健君回答桫椤派去调查我的人：“卢岩心理的社会环境和别人不一样。他念研究生的时候，他同屋那个人是我爸爸安排的。他们就一起骗他；他就信了。”

调查的人问：“现在你爸爸在哪儿？”

刘健君回答：“死了！我爸爸做的事儿与我没有关系。那时我不在国内，我在美国读博士呢！”

调查的人问：“那你为什么不告诉卢岩？”

One day during a coffee break, I listened to my colleagues chatting. Afterwards, for some reason, I recalled Mary's talk about the video she watched in the meeting. Eve Liu answered the person sent by Sal Fasullo to investigate me: ""Luyan's psychological social environment is different from others. When he was a graduate student, the person he shared a room with was arranged by my father. They lied to him together; he believed it.""

The investigator asked, ""Where is your father now?""

Eve Liu replied, ""Dead! What my father did has nothing to do with me. I was not in China at that time, I was in the United States studying for my doctorate!""

The investigator asked, ""Then why didn't you tell Luyan?""

刘健君回答：“我爸说，卢岩很犟。他不亲眼看见，谁告诉他，他都不信，就只能是别人在他旁边唠嗑，或者路上的人唠嗑，他听见了，就想。一点儿点儿地，他想明白了，就没事儿了。”

调查的人问：“你爸爸想让卢岩干什么？”

刘健君回答：“他说我这辈子命运中没有丈夫，除了卢岩，别人都不行。说我不是他的女儿，卢岩是他的儿子。他就想让我和卢岩结婚。我爸说，看不见我和卢岩结婚，他死不瞑目。你看，我不迷信，不信这个。”

Eve Liu replied, ""My dad said that Luyan was very stubborn. If he didn't see it with his own eyes, he wouldn't believe anyone who told him, so he could only think about it when others chattered next to him or people on the road chattered, and he heard it. Little by little, he figured it out, and then he was fine.""

The investigator asked, ""What did your father want Luyan to do?""

Eve Liu replied, ""He said that I had no husband in my life, and that no one else would do except Luyan. He said that I am not his daughter and Luyan is his son. He then wanted me to marry Luyan. My dad said he can't see me marry Luyan, he dies with eyes open. You see! I am not superstitious and don't believe in this.""

我回忆起来玛丽亚所说的话之后，感觉奇怪：如果这是我以前想过的事，想象与现实混淆了，那不应该有我根本不知道的事。我回忆起了本书第2章中《桃花劫》的故事，是我妈妈给我讲的。她不记得 “前世姻缘，命中注定” 这八个字了。那玛丽亚说的这八个字是从哪里来的（注2）！？而且玛丽说的是英语，她的用词和我英语用词的习惯根本不一样。我回忆、分析刘团长已经五、六年没对我做过什么了，认为他真的已经过世了。

我认为刘团长真的早就过世了，心情很不好，两三天里像似病了一样。我怀疑刘健君收买了我的妻子，并委托人照顾我的孩子，我总发现他们在变化。

注10.1-2，环境形成后，相关的语言就会出现。在前文第2章，我两岁时听这样的词当然不理解，记忆也很少，但这时有了相关的环境，这词就冒出来了。

After I recalled what Marry said, felt strange: If this was something I had thought about before, and imagination was confused with reality, then there shouldn't be something I didn't know. I recalled the story of ""Peach Flower Catastrophe"" in Chapter 2 of this book, which my mother told me. She didn't remember the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. So where did Mary's eight words come from (Note 2)!? And Mary spoke English; her word usage was completely different from my English verbal habits. I recalled and analyzed that Troupe Leader Liu had not done anything to me for five or six years, thought he was dead.

I thought that Troupe Leader Liu had really passed away a long time ago. I was in a very bad mood and seemed to be sick for two or three days. I suspected that Eve Liu bribed my wife and entrusted someone to take care of my children. I always found that they were changing.

Note 10.1-2, after the environment is formed, the related language will appear. In the previous chapter 2, when I was two years old, I didn’t understand such words and I had very little memory, but now there is a related environment, so the words pop up.

1o0ysnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/1o0ysnv/founding_the_boston_nofitness_democratic/,Founding the Boston No-Fitness Democratic Dictatorship,"# We Will Walk Slowly and Rule Kindly

Hello, comrades and couch potatoes of the Greater Boston Area.

I am forming the **Boston No-Fitness Democratic Dictatorship**, a social collective for people who:

* Have been meaning to start exercising since 2017 but keep “waiting for the right vibe”
* Believe a brisk walk counts as cardio *if you were emotionally invested in the conversation*
* Want community, mild snacks, and zero expectations

This is not a joke (but also it’s mostly a joke).

# Our Core Tenets

1. **No fitness.** We will meet in places that *discourage* movement — think dimly lit bars, public libraries, MBTA platforms where the train is always “2 stops away.”
2. **Democratic dictatorship.** Everyone has a voice. But I have the final say. Unless someone brings really good baked goods, in which case we can discuss a peaceful coup.
3. **Vibes-based governance.** Decisions are made via “vibe consensus,” not voting. If it feels wrong, we don’t do it. If it feels funny, we probably do it twice.
4. **Boston-based loyalty.** You don’t have to *like* Boston, but you do have to *complain* about it frequently.
5. **Dress code:** layers. Always too many layers.

# Membership Perks

* Occasional access to communal snacks (chips, Trader Joe’s frozen apps, lukewarm coffee)
* Emotional support during mild inconveniences (waiting for the 57, running out of oat milk)
* Zero judgment if you say “we should totally hike sometime” and never follow up

# First Gathering

TBD. Probably somewhere with chairs. Maybe in the Public Garden, but only if it’s overcast and 63°F.

Comment if you want to be part of the **founding council** (which will immediately dissolve due to indecision).

Very few movies actually get the second part right and of course, that’s subjective.

**Biggest surprise?** The *visual effects*! I genuinely didn’t expect animation to blend this seamlessly into live action. ಹ್ಯಾಟ್ಸ್ ಆಫ್, whoever pulled that off you deserve a lifetime supply of filter coffee, mosaranna and applause! ☕👏

**Music:** Good, solid, never overdid it. But if I compare, Part 1 was still a notch higher. Still, kudos to the team not boring us in a long movie is an achievement by itself!

**Sets, costumes, camerawork:** Excellent. Technically, this movie is like that one student who gets full marks in lab but just misses theory by a few marks.

**Casting and acting:** Here’s where things get a bit tricky. There were too many characters, and some of them felt misplaced. I really like *Rukmini Vasanth*, but somehow I kept seeing *Priya from Sapta* more than *Kanakavathi*. Maybe that’s my bias showing 😅. Also, *Achyuth Kumar* was completely underused, and Rishab’s side characters weren’t as strong this time, especially after how high the bar was set in Part 1.

**Story:** Hmm… this one almost follows the trailer. Apart from one big twist, there wasn’t much to hold on to. Part 1 kept you guessing and flowing; this one, not so much. It’s like watching a train that starts well but keeps stopping at every unnecessary station 🚉.

**Fillers:** Too many! At one point, I was like, “Wait, how much backstory and explanation do we need to understand the movie?” The backstory overload made it a bit tiring.

**Humour:** Forced in places. Some jokes actually diluted good scenes instead of elevating them. ನಗ್ಬೇಕು ಅನ್ಸತ್ತೆ, but scene spoil ಆಗತ್ತೆ.

And unlike the first part, there wasn’t any big *“aha!”* message that stays with you afterward.

**Verdict:** A solid *3 out of 5*. Rishab Shetty still deserves credit for taking risks and pushing boundaries. I just hope he doesn’t get pulled too deep into the *commercial* ocean 🌊.  
Also, huge respect to *Raj B Shetty* for deciding not to make a Part 2 of *Su from So.* sometimes, knowing where to stop *is* genius. 🙏",2,1759890584.0,ChitraLoka,0,0.75,False

We see each other every day. For months, there’s been a quiet emotional tension, glances, teasing, moments that felt like something electric was between us. It wasn’t overt, but it wasn’t nothing. We both have partners so there was an added sense that we were somehow also avoiding the vibe between us and never naming it - a kind of jarring, unspoken thing. I’d see her get closer with new friends but it felt like for us the elephant in the room stopped us from developing anything normal. I don’t know if that makes sense. I’m not invited to anything of hers and I don’t invite her to anything of mine, but she’ll end up in my office over random lunches or we’ll end up alone after something at work, and there it will be, that feeling that there’s something between us. We tease each other and I feel like a stupid school boy all over again.

I was getting tired of the weirdness and us not hanging out normally, so I invited her to grab a coffee yesterday. She said yes. In the car and at the cafe there was mild flirting and the usual teasing. It felt warm and familiar. Like we were sharing that unspoken thing again.

Then, when we got back she told me she’s getting married.

I feel confused, gutted, and somehow a bit used. Not because I expected anything to happen, but because I just don’t know what it was all for. We went somewhere we probably shouldn’t have, I get it, but I don’t understand the mixed messages, the looks and charged comments over months. What was the point of it all? Then suddenly ‘we’re getting married’ and all the excitement that she naturally feels.

I don’t know what this was. I don’t know if I misread it. I don’t know how to show up at work without shrinking or pretending it didn’t happen. I’m worried she’s going to invite me to the wedding.

Has anyone else been through something like this? How do you process something that never fully formed—but still felt real? I just to escape. I feel like such a fool and a d**k as I have a partner and never intended for this to happen. Please dm me. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it.

1o0ylww,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1o0ylww/my_best_friends_boyfriend_refuses_to_meet_me_or/,My best friend’s boyfriend refuses to meet me or my husband and I’m struggling not to take it personally. Am I overreacting?,"My (30F) best friend (29F) has been dating her boyfriend for just under a year. From everything she’s told me, he’s great, kind, funny, good to her, close with her family. She’s genuinely happy and I love that for her. But I’ve never met him. Not once. Not even a “hey” in the background when she’s at his place and we’re on the phone.

For context, I’m married with four kids (12M, 9M, almost 4M, and 1.5F) and four dogs (medium to large). It’s a full house, but we’ve invited her to do adult-only things like coffee, dinner, backyard hangouts with the kids at grandma’s, etc. My husband’s a friendly Italian cook who lives to feed people, and I’m an introvert who can turn on my social side when needed (thanks former sales career). We’re not loud or overbearing, just… busy.

Her boyfriend has social anxiety and is in treatment, which I completely respect. I also have anxiety and am on a mini pharmacy of anxiety meds, so I understand how hard it can be. I’ve wanted to meet him someday because he makes my friend so happy, but I’ve tried not to push. I’d love to throw her a quiet birthday party or something without her feeling like she has multiple places to be. 

She and he agreed that he can meet people at his own pace as long as he keeps working on it, and I totally respect that. But last weekend, he had lunch with her other best friend — and while I’m genuinely happy for them, it stung a little. Especially because he’s told her he doesn’t care if he ever meets me or my husband, and that “we sound like a lot.”

That comment really hurt. I love my friend and want her to be able to bring him around without stress, maybe to a BBQ or a hangout, but right now it feels like we’re the only ones in her life he’s written off completely.

To add to that, my friend also has a daughter who hasn’t been introduced to her BF as a BF just yet. Since they got more serious, we don’t hang out much outside of her nannying for my little kids (1.5 and almost 4) while I work from home. That started because my daughter was injured at daycare last year and it was bad enough to involve insurance and lawyers. We aren’t comfortable returning them to daycare and in trying to work out what to do, she offered to nanny for them as she was unhappy in her other work. We’ve all agreed if it ever stops working for anyone that’s a-okay, but in the mean time we pay her more than she asked for. Anyhow, while we see each other all the time, it’s not friend time — it’s her working and me working while we chat here and there. And when she has free time without her daughter, she usually spends it with him, which I understand. I don’t really ask her to hang out much because she’s said how limited their time together is and how it bothers her, and I don’t want to add to her stress.

I’m just sad. I miss her. I wish I could meet the person who’s become such a big part of her life. And while I know this isn’t about me, it’s hard not to feel left out. ",1,1759890318.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I am freaking out.,"I woke up and I immediately freaked out. The one thing you can't do for sure is read in dreams and I did it(ofc there are exceptions). How is that even possible? 

I am supposed to go to doctors with my husband today and so that was the dream about. My husband and I were waiting at the hospital lobby. We went to the reception and gave our names and the lady said that we will have to wait as she is making the records as book(whatever that means lol). We were waiting in the lobby and she gave us a book. It actually looked like a coffee table magazine or whatever. So I opened and there were photos of mine and my husband's. Passport sized photos. And then there were names and stuff I hope ofc I couldn't read and I don't remember either. I kept turning the pages over and every page has some medical record like ECG, scanner etc. 

Then came a page, which I still remember clearly.. in that page there was a table.. and each row and column has some words in one column and + - symbol in the other column. So most of the words are messy. I was not able to read. Ofcourse. Some of the words in the table are ringworm and tapeworm which I read. And below the table there is a mention of + means positive and - means negative. And I was able to read that too and I still remember it. 

And then I was like ""omg we have worms"" and I woke up. I woke up in the middle of the night and to pee and I realized I just read in the dream and I freaked out. 

What could be the reason? How is that scientifically possible? 

I lucid dream, I get recurring dreams in which I change the events remembering the previous occurance, I get this dream continuity after many days.. everytime such dreams happened I had freaked out but now I'm used to it and atleast it can have some explanations. But reading? How is that possible when your reading function won't work while sleeping? 

P.S I wasn't lucid dreaming today.

Rent was overdue, the eviction notice was taped to my door like a scarlet letter, and my fridge held nothing but half a bottle of ketchup and a takeout container I was too afraid to open. I’d stopped answering calls weeks ago, there were only so many ways to say “I’ll pay you next Friday” when Friday had stopped showing up for you.

Every night I sat in front of my laptop until my eyes burned, scrolling through job sites that blurred together into one long rejection letter. Experience required. Degree preferred. Must be willing to smile while dying inside.

No one hires someone whose only résumé entry is “desperate.”

That’s when I saw it.

It wasn’t even online. I was walking home from the grocery store, empty-handed because even ramen felt like a luxury, and I noticed a flyer taped to the bus stop shelter. It was printed on plain white paper, the kind you’d pull from a dusty office printer.

Black letters. No logo. No company name.

SELL YOUR TIME.

Competitive rates. No experience necessary.

I laughed. Out loud, to no one.

A scam, obviously. Some shady gig that ends with your kidneys on the dark web. But the thing stuck in my head the entire walk home, like an earworm. Sell your time. The words were too simple, too confident, like whoever wrote them didn’t care if you believed or not.

By the time I reached my apartment, curiosity had started wrestling with hopelessness. What if it wasn’t a scam? What if it was just weird? Weird was better than starving.

The email was printed in tiny letters at the bottom of the page. I typed it in, hit send, and told myself it was just a joke.

They replied before I even finished making coffee.

The message was short.

Thank you for your interest in ChronoCorp.

Orientation available tomorrow, 9:00 AM. No documentation required.

Please arrive on time.

No address signature, no phone number. Just a street name I’d never heard of and those last two words — on time.

The next morning, I went. I don’t even remember deciding to. I just remember standing in front of a building that looked too clean to exist in my part of town.

ChronoCorp.

The name was printed in thin silver letters above the glass doors. No slogan, no logo. Inside, the air smelled like nothing, the sterile, filtered kind of nothing that only money can afford. Everything gleamed white: the floors, the walls, even the furniture. The only color came from the clocks.

There were so many clocks.

Dozens of them lined the walls, each one a little different, antique brass, digital displays, wristwatches in glass cases, but all ticking in perfect, synchronized rhythm. Not a single second out of place.

The sound was hypnotic. Soft but endless.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

The receptionist sat behind a white counter that looked like it had never known dust. Her hair was neatly pinned back, her uniform spotless, her expression... off. Like a smile worn thin from too much practice.

“Thank you for your interest in ChronoCorp,” she said, every syllable smooth and balanced. “We value every second.”

I told her I didn’t have a résumé. She didn’t blink.

“We won’t need that.”

She slid a clipboard toward me. The paper was thick and heavy, the kind you’d use for wedding invitations.

It wasn’t a job application. There was no section for previous employment or emergency contact. Just a handful of lines filled with legal jargon that might as well have been written in another language.

The only part in bold, centered in the middle of the page, read:

TIME EXCHANGED.

There was a line for a signature underneath.

I hesitated, glancing up to ask a question, but the receptionist wasn’t looking at me anymore.

Her gaze was fixed on the largest clock on the wall, a massive black-and-gold thing that ticked with mechanical precision.

For a moment, I thought the sound of it got louder. Like the air itself was keeping time.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

“Do I need to…?” I started, but she cut me off gently.

“Just sign, and we’ll take care of the rest.”

Her tone was kind. Too kind. Like someone comforting a child before a vaccination.

My stomach twisted, but the word “paycheck” echoed in my head louder than the ticking.

I signed.

She smiled, not warmly, but with a kind of satisfaction that made my chest tighten. Then she reached for a small silver stopwatch on the counter, pressed it once, and said softly:

“Your time begins now.”

The ticking in the room seemed to falter for a single beat.

Just one.

Then everything went perfectly, eerily back to rhythm.

The job turned out to be… easy.

Too easy.

A man in a gray suit met me in the lobby the next morning. He didn’t smile, didn’t introduce himself, just turned on his heel and motioned for me to follow. His shoes made no sound on the tile. Mine did. That was the first thing that felt wrong: it was like the building only chose to echo for me.

The hallways stretched longer than they should have. Clean. Too clean. White walls, chrome trim, soft white lights that never flickered, and clocks, everywhere. Wall clocks, desk clocks, floor clocks, all ticking together in a perfect synchronized rhythm. The sound should have been comforting, but it wasn’t. It reminded me of breathing—one, two, three—and I couldn’t tell if it was mine or the building’s.

We passed door after door, each labeled Donation Room followed by a number. I tried to count them, but somewhere between 6 and 9, I lost track. The numbers didn’t make sense. We turned corners that didn’t seem to exist in the building’s floor plan I’d seen online.

Finally, he stopped at Donation Room 7. The door opened with a soft click, and he motioned me inside.

The room was small, barely big enough for the chair in the center and the machine beside it. The machine looked old, older than the building itself. Heavy brass panels, faint scratches on its surface, the kind of hum you feel more than hear. Wires coiled out from its sides like veins, ending in silver discs the size of coins. A dial on the front read:

Hours Donated: 0.00.

“Please sit,” the man said. His voice was quiet, smooth, practiced.

I obeyed, mostly out of habit, out of hunger.

The discs against my temples were cold enough to make me flinch. The metal smelled faintly like ozone, like lightning before a storm.

“You may feel a brief acceleration,” he said. “That’s normal.”

Acceleration. I opened my mouth to ask what that meant, but before I could speak, the hum deepened. It wasn’t loud, more like a pressure behind my eyes. My heartbeat started matching it. Or maybe it was the other way around.

Then it stopped.

The man was already removing the discs. His movements were calm, deliberate, unbothered.

The wall clock said an hour had passed. My phone said the same. But I hadn’t felt it. Not a second of it. My body felt rested, lighter, like I’d been asleep but better. My hunger was gone, replaced by this strange clarity—like my brain had been polished.

The man handed me a slip of paper. $480.

“Payment is automatic,” he said. “You’ll receive it instantly.”

He was right. By the time I checked my phone, the deposit was already there. No delay, no pending transaction. Just, done.

The second session went the same. So did the third.

Each visit, I’d sit, feel the hum, blink, and time would vanish. No dizziness. No side effects. Just missing hours and a bigger balance in my account.

Other employees drifted through the hallways like ghosts in pressed uniforms. They didn’t talk much. They didn’t look much either. Sometimes I’d pass someone I swore I’d seen before, only their face would seem slightly off. Not in a big way, just subtly rearranged, like they were the same person but through a fogged mirror.

Once, I stopped by the vending machine on my way out and saw a woman staring at it, hand hovering over the keypad, motionless. Her reflection in the metal looked sharper than her actual face.

“What does it do?” I asked, nodding toward her door.

She blinked slowly, then smiled without looking up. “Don’t overthink it,” she said. “Just enjoy the paychecks.”

And I did.

The money felt unreal at first, too much, too easy, but after a few sessions, I stopped questioning it. Bills disappeared. The fridge filled up. I bought a new mattress, decent headphones, even a proper coat for the first time in years. I slept through the night without the usual dread gnawing at me.

For a while, it felt like maybe this was what stability looked like.

But little things started bothering me.

The clocks, for one. They ticked in perfect unison, at work, at home, even on my phone. I’d lie in bed sometimes and hear it under the silence, soft, steady, everywhere.

And the seconds. They’d skip.

Not randomly, but rhythmically, like something was cutting out the empty space between ticks. Sometimes my phone would jump from 10:42:06 to 10:42:08, cleanly, like the world had blinked and moved on without me.

I told myself it was nothing. Just a glitch.

But some mornings I’d wake up and my phone’s alarm would already be ringing, even though I hadn’t set it. I’d check the call log and see a number labeled “ChronoCorp HQ,” listed at times I didn’t remember being awake.

And every night, just before I drifted off, I’d feel that faint hum behind my temples again.

It wasn’t loud enough to scare me.

Just loud enough to remind me it was still there.

Counting.

The first thing I lost was a meal.

Nothing major. Just dinner.

I came home one night, dropped my keys on the counter, and saw an empty plate in the sink. Grease streaks. Crumbs. A fork balanced across it. Only, I hadn’t cooked. I hadn’t eaten.

I stood there staring at the plate longer than I care to admit, waiting for some memory to click into place. It didn’t. The smell of garlic still lingered in the air, faint but fresh.

I checked my phone.

A text from my friend Mia: “That pasta was good. You should cook more often.”

My thumb hovered over the screen. I hadn’t seen her in weeks.

I started to type back, something like What pasta?, but before I finished, the typing bubbles appeared on her end. Then froze. Then disappeared. The timestamp on her message read “Yesterday.”

I stared at that word until the phone went dark.

After that, it wasn’t just dinner.

I’d open my fridge and find groceries I didn’t remember buying, fresh fruit, cold cuts, a bottle of wine that definitely hadn’t been there the day before. Once I found a grocery receipt in my jacket pocket, signed in my handwriting, with a timestamp for 2:13 a.m.

Sometimes I’d wake up and my laundry was folded neatly in the basket. Once, my sheets were changed. I don’t even own spare sheets.

For a while, I blamed stress. Or maybe the sessions at ChronoCorp were messing with my sleep schedule. Maybe “donating hours” confused my body clock. It was the only explanation that didn’t make me sound insane.

But it wasn’t just me.

One morning, the clocks in my apartment stopped. Every single one, digital, analog, wall, phone, for exactly one second.

Then, without a sound, they all caught up in perfect unison.

I stood there holding my breath, listening to the faint tick that seemed to crawl under everything. The fridge hum, the traffic outside, even my heartbeat, everything was syncing to that rhythm.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

It wasn’t loud. It didn’t need to be. It was constant.

Then came the bruises.

Small, circular ones on my arms and neck. Not painful, just there. The size of a coin. I tried to remember bumping into something, but the harder I tried, the more my memories slipped away like water between fingers.

Some mornings, there’d be new marks. Faint scratches along my ribs. Little red indentations on my temples where the discs used to sit.

At work, no one mentioned them. The man in the gray suit still met me in the lobby, still walked me wordlessly to Donation Room 7.

Same chair. Same hum. Same slip of paper with a new number.

Only the machine was different this time.

The dial didn’t start at zero.

It already read 3.00 when I sat down.

I frowned. “Why does it say that?”

The man’s expression didn’t change, but his eyes seemed… distant, like he was reading off a script written behind my head.

“It accounts for carryover,” he said.

“Carryover of what?”

He smiled. It was the kind of smile people practice in mirrors, all muscle, no meaning.

“Time isn’t lost,” he said softly. “It’s redistributed.”

Before I could respond, the hum began.

This time, I felt it deeper. Not in my head, in my bones. The air thickened. My vision tunneled.

When it stopped, I didn’t feel lighter.

I felt stretched.

Like part of me hadn’t caught up yet. Like I’d stood up too fast and left something behind.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The hum seemed to follow me home, whispering in the stillness. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw numbers flickering behind my eyelids—3.00, 4.25, 6.00—like my dreams were clocking in.

The next morning, Mia called me.

I almost didn’t answer. When I finally did, her voice was trembling.

“Hey,” she said. “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine. Why?”

“You don’t remember, do you?”

“Remember what?”

Silence. Long, unsteady. Then:

“You were at my place last night. You brought wine. You told me you quit your job.”

My chest went tight. “No, I didn’t.”

Her breath hitched. “You did. You were different. You looked… happy. But your eyes…”

“What about them?”

Another pause. Then, quietly:

“They weren’t yours.”

I didn’t know what to say. I think I hung up without meaning to.

That night, I didn’t sleep. Couldn’t. The hum was louder now, steady, pulsing behind my eyes like a second heartbeat. The clocks in my room ticked out of sync for the first time since I’d started at ChronoCorp.

Then, one by one, they corrected themselves.

Except my wristwatch.

It was still ticking a second too fast.

When I tried to reset it, the second hand pushed back.

Not jammed. Not broken.

Pushing back.

Like something inside was fighting to keep going.

I stopped going in for a week.

No calls. No emails. No one from ChronoCorp showed up at my door.

At first, I thought maybe they’d forgotten about me. Then the direct deposits kept coming.

Every Friday. Same time. Same amount.

Even though I hadn’t clocked in.

That’s what broke me.

It wasn’t guilt. It was curiosity.

If they didn’t need me to show up, then where the hell was my time coming from?

I decided to go back, not to work, but to find out who was signing my life away.

ChronoCorp’s lobby looked different that morning.

Brighter somehow. Polished. The walls gleamed with that false, hospital-white sheen that only fluorescent light can make. The air was sterile, humming softly with the sound of electricity, or maybe time itself.

And the clocks.

They were everywhere.

But this time, every single one showed the same thing: 12:00.

Hundreds of them, ticking in unison, yet somehow perfectly silent.

The receptionist smiled when she saw me.

“Mr. Hale,” she said, her voice syrup-smooth.

I froze.

“My name isn’t—”

She tilted her head, still smiling.

“It will be.”

She slid a visitor badge across the desk. I looked down.

It didn’t say Visitor.

It said:

DONOR 27 — EXPIRED ACCESS.

Something inside me twisted.

I didn’t correct her. I just took the badge and walked past before she could stop me.

The hallways were quieter than usual, but I could feel movement through the walls—machines breathing, wires pulsing. The floors vibrated faintly under my shoes, like the building had a heartbeat.

I passed room after room, glass walls revealing rows of people slumped in the same reclining chairs I’d used. Discs on their temples. The machines beside them pulsed with faint blue light.

Most were motionless. Some twitched.

Their eyes fluttered beneath closed lids, as if they were dreaming someone else’s dream.

I reached the end of the corridor.

A locked glass door read:

CLIENT ACCESS — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

I swiped my badge, just to try.

The lock clicked open.

Inside was colder. The temperature dropped a few degrees instantly, and my breath fogged the glass.

Rows of monitors filled the room—hundreds of screens showing live feeds of people. All ordinary moments: a man eating dinner, a woman brushing her hair, a child playing with a dog. All of them… happy.

None of them noticed the cameras.

Then one screen caught my eye.

The feed showed me.

I was in a restaurant I didn’t recognize, wearing a suit I didn’t own, drinking wine I couldn’t afford. Across from me sat a woman, older, elegant, poised in a way money teaches. She was smiling, calm, as if she’d known me forever.

A label flashed at the corner of the feed:

CLIENT: ADELA HALE

PURCHASED HOURS: 268.

268 hours.

Eleven days.

That’s how much of me she owned.

I clicked into the file.

Notes appeared:

Excellent physical compatibility. Responsive body control. Requests recurring sessions.

Remaining balance: 2 years, 11 months, 4 days.

My mouth went dry.

I hadn’t sold that much.

“ You’re not supposed to be here.”

The voice came from behind me.

The man in the gray suit. Same one from the first day. Only now, his face looked thinner—like someone had scraped the human off him and left something hollow underneath.

“She likes your body,” he said, calm as ever. “Says it’s easy to move in.”

I turned on him. “I didn’t agree to this.”

He shrugged, almost kindly. “You signed the contract. You didn’t specify the limit. That’s what happens when you sell time in bulk.”

I laughed, sharp and ugly. “Then I want it back.”

He tilted his head, watching me the way a clock might watch a second hand.

“You can’t take back what’s already spent.”

My hands shook. I grabbed the monitor, yanking it sideways. “Where is she?”

He looked up, eyes flicking toward the clock above the door.

“Not here,” he said. “She’s in there.”

The clock read 12:00.

It didn’t move.

Then something cracked inside my skull, like the sound of glass shattering underwater.

The air folded inward.

I was standing in the restaurant.

Same table. Same wine.

Adela Hale sat across from me, smiling my own smile.

“Hello, darling,” she said.

And it was my voice.

I stumbled back. “Get out of me.”

She chuckled softly. “You gave me this. You didn’t want the time. I simply made better use of it.”

The restaurant froze mid-motion, waiters paused mid-step, wine mid-pour, laughter suspended in the air like a photo.

The light flickered, but it wasn’t dimming. It was hesitating.

When I looked down, my hands weren’t syncing.

One lagged behind the other, like my body couldn’t decide what second it belonged to.

She stood, lifting her glass with perfect grace.

“You shouldn’t have come back,” she said. “You’re making a mess of the schedule.”

The walls bent inward. The air shimmered, bending sound and shape together.

I could hear the hum again, the same low vibration from the Donation Room, only now it filled every inch of me. My bones vibrated with it.

“Stop,” I whispered.

She smiled wider. “It’s already stopped.”

And she was right.

Everything was motionless except her, and me.

Then I realized she wasn’t really moving either.

She was replaying seconds ahead of me, like I was watching her future through a glass wall I couldn’t reach.

“Time,” she whispered, her voice overlapping itself like echoes in a tunnel,

“doesn’t belong to anyone. It just waits for someone desperate enough to sell it.”

I blinked, and she was gone.

So was the restaurant.

I was back in Donation Room 7.

Empty chair. Cold air. The hum fading into silence.

Only the clock on the wall remained.

Still ticking—one second too fast.

I reached for it, desperate to stop the sound, to prove I still existed.

My hand passed straight through.

The hum cut out.

Everything stopped.

For a heartbeat, I thought that was peace.

Then I realized it wasn’t silence.

It was the sound of something waiting to start again.

I woke up to the hum again.

Familiar, but distant.

Not my own heartbeat this time, it was someone else’s, pulsing inside me in a rhythm I couldn’t claim.

The chair beneath me was cold. Donation Room 7. Same walls. Same ceiling. Same hum trembling faintly through the air like a held breath, like the room itself was waiting for me to remember.

A slip of paper lay on the counter.

My handwriting. Only the number was different.

$1,200.

I didn’t remember doing it.

The receptionist smiled when I stumbled out. Perfect. Practiced. Empty, like her face was drawn onto glass.

“Thank you for your service,” she said.

“I… I don’t—”

My voice cracked. The words felt foreign, like I was trying to speak through static, like someone else was borrowing my mouth to answer for me.

Her eyes flicked toward the clock above the door. It wasn’t ticking. Or maybe it was, but the seconds weren’t mine anymore.

“Your time begins now,” she whispered.

I turned toward the mirror.

It wasn’t me.

Not entirely.

The face staring back belonged to someone else, wearing my eyes like borrowed glass. My hair, my skin, my hands… but hollow. A mask I had worn for someone else’s comfort. Its smile twitched half a beat too late.

The hum grew louder. Not just the machine. The walls. The air. The space between my ribs. Every breath vibrated like it was running on borrowed seconds. Every heartbeat felt leased, out of sync with my chest.

I tried to speak. My mouth moved. The words weren’t mine.

I tried to move. My body responded halfway, awkwardly, uncertainly. A marionette with tangled strings, limbs jerking just off‑time.

Then the screen in front of me flickered on.

Another me appeared, sitting in an office I didn’t recognize, smiling at a client I didn’t know.

Hours I’d never lived. Memories I’d never made.

Playing back in real time like a recording, except the recording was my body.

In one feed I was laughing; in another I was crying. In one I was holding a child. In another, a knife.

All of it me.

None of it mine.

I realized with a sick clarity:

I wasn’t gone. Not yet. But I was someone else’s property now.

The receptionist reached for the stopwatch.

Pressed it once.

“Your hour has been sold,” she said softly. “Enjoy the rest of your life… if you can call it that.”

The world wavered.

The hum became a single, stretched note that filled everything.

Every second I’d counted as mine slipped through my fingers like sand, leaving only the rhythm of something still ticking, somewhere far away.

I tried to scream. The sound that came out was mine—and yet not.

I tried to remember who I was. Nothing. Just a lingering echo of borrowed time.

Then nothing.

No pain. No sound. Just a faint, eternal ticking, waiting for the next desperate soul.

I thought: Maybe this is what eternity feels like.

It's a very small company, with around 15 employees in total. It was the president who interviewed me. He seems like a very nice and understanding person. He works in a different country, where the main office is, while we are located elsewhere.

I knew about this company from a friend who used to work there, he said it was WFH. During my online interview in May, I was told that the position is no longer WFH, and all new hires henceforth would have to report to the office. He said they are slowly getting the other employees back to the office and are in search of a bigger office to accommodate everyone. He said there was one new hire before me. I was told so far, the office has 4 desks and is located in a shared office space with other companies.

So I started working here in August and well... the office is not great. It's a 2.5mx3m room with 3 desks. It feels very claustrophobic. My first day was horrible. It was literally just me for most of the day cause the other new hire I mentioned was on leave that time. The manager just dropped off my computer and left. There are no windows. There's centralized air conditioning so it's so very cold. The other new hire got back a week after and we're okay but we don't talk much. I've tried initiating conversation, but I think we just don't vibe well. There's been another new hire after me. We talk more, and it's been better.

I decided that if the condition is still like this after some months, then I'll leave. I don't see the incentive of having to commute all the way here, costing time and money, to do something I can do at home. The incentive of working in the office is collaboration and resources, which I don't feel I'm getting. And the environment feels claustrophobic and isolating.

WIBTA if I raise this concern to the president? Minus the potentially leaving part. He's told me I can tell him any concerns I have. I would be happy if we actually get a bigger office, but what if the other employees would hate me for being the reason they can't WFH anymore?

  
Edit: Why I don't just tell my manager. One time she stopped by, and she said if we ever feel cramp then we can just walk around in the halls or walk in the pantry cause we are allowed access there, except for the coffee and water. Even though I'd been getting water for weeks. She said it should be fine cause the shared office space people didn't complain or reprimand us. The president later on asked me how the coffee was and I told him that story, and he was confused cause he was told we have access. He apologized and we were told we now have access.",4,1759889759.0,AmItheAsshole,16,0.83,False

I’m planning a one-day trip to Pittsburgh for my girlfriend’s 20th birthday and could use some local advice. We’ll probably come in the morning and head out that night, so I want to fit in a few fun things without it feeling rushed.

We’ll be there in November on a Sunday. She’s into good food, cool views, and local spots that feel more authentic than touristy. Money’s a bit tight, but I still want to treat her, just not drop like $500 on one dinner.

I’m thinking something like coffee then a park or something scenic and then brunch/lunch then something fun and then dinner with a view?

I’ll appreciate any recommendations especially spots that feel a little special or “only in pittsburgh.” If anyone has any other plans/itinerary for us I’ll also by all means take it!

1o0yafr,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1o0yafr/toxic_nonprofit_controlled_by_a_narcissistic/,Toxic non-profit controlled by a narcissistic dictator (feat. egotistical leaders),"I work for a non profit and I recently discovered some pretty shady things. I will list them all below:

1. Micromanagement is EXTREME. They record all of our calls with donors and they never disclosed this to us nor the donors. They read all of our messages, emails, they track our work under a microscope, and they record all of our meetings.

2. We have recurring donations set by default as a way to trick people into donating (And our CEO says ""they most likely won't notice and if they do, they'll be too hesitant and feel guilty to ask for a refund"")

3. HR updates our Employee handbooks multiple times a year as a result of an employee who does something the CEO doesn't like (ex. It was never mandatory to have cameras on during meetings but when people would keep their camera off, HR implemented the rule on the employee hand book and forced employees to sign or face termination).

4. The CEO always bitches about the budget but approves a high budget for an unnecessary project that he simply just likes rather than a much needed project that he doesn't like, which causes a higher workload on employees needed to complete said project.

5. HR is sending out feedback forms as a means to hear the employees and make changes towards a positive work environment but I'm 100% sure it's a trap to terminate those who have too much to say OR a trap to change the employee handbook again. I am certain of this because a few months ago, there was an investigation towards a manager that was reported by multiple people to HR. HR launched the investigation in a very indirect way (did not tell employees what the investigation was for and asked very ambiguous questions) and the result of it was that the manager still works with us but the CEO threatened to fire anyone bad mouthing the org or anyone in management. There was also speculation that one of the employees is a ""Mole"" who builds trust with employees and reports everything they say back to the CEO.

4. Whenever someone speaks up about something unethical in the organization, there is usually a response after 2 whole weeks from HR, staging a meeting to make the employee feel seen, just to terminate them at the end of the meeting and by the very next day, they already hired a replacement (which tells me the 2 week delay was used solely to hire a back up employee under wraps)

5. The CEO is completely two faced and verbally abusive. He puts on a smile and positive energy in front of everyone but unprofessionally scolds, threatens, and disrespects employees in one-on-one settings. He gives people false hope that he's on their side and throws them under the bus immediately after. He's been reported numerous times by previous staff and all of those employees ended up terminated.

6. The CEO uses donor funds for personal expenses. There are several transactions on the ledger that show personal expenses as little as a coffee to as big as an all paid business class trip abroad in a 5-star hotel for his entire family. Which leads me to my next point...

7. The CEO crosses major integrity lines due to his hunger for money (See point 2). He feels threatened and shuts down anyone who proposes an idea that prioritizes anything else other than the money (Ex. There was a donor that has donated and volunteered in the past and complained that we never update him on projects he's donated to. I suggested we use our time and resources to launch an initiative for donors to keep active track of projects they've donated to. The CEO responds by saying ""Doing that is going to take time away from making solicitation calls and it's better to lose one donor with a bad experience than losing money from solicitation calls""). Whenever we host an event, he tells us to tell donors that 100% of ticket sales goes towards donations even though ticket sales are used to cover the cost of the event in reality. When an employee solicits a donation, instead of congratulating them, he scolds them for not getting a bigger donation. He's quick in having us generate donations without figuring out where the donations are going towards first.

8. Everyone else in leadership is the CEO's puppet and when they're free to make their own decisions, they only make decisions based on their bias (Ex. if an employee proposes a logical project but someone in leadership wants the opposite project, even though it's poorly designed and less successful, they will sabotage the original idea just so that their idea get chosen).

9. People in management lack leadership, transparency, and good decision making. There is an upcoming event that I was told my attendance was required. I got excited about it as I really wanted to attend (and even postponed travel plans) until my coworker mentioned that the budget was cut and I probably won't be attending. It wasn't until I went out of my way to ask my manager was I told that I wasn't attending. I have been putting in more work than anyone else on my team for the success of this event. Then I find out that my other coworker was sent to the event 2 weeks in advance even though she resides in a different state, on the opposite side of the nation, is paid hourly, and is completely unfamiliar with the area. I reside in the same state the event is held in, know that area better than anyone else, and am paid salary so it would have been significantly cheaper to send me to the event rather than my colleague. Now I find out that said colleague is just out there hooking up with tinder matches, getting high at the beach, and meeting up with online friends rather than working. But in general, leadership makes bad decisions with finances, donors, programs, etc. There is absolutely no logic behind their decisions and seems like they just make them entirely based off of desire or mood.

10. There are a lot of liars in leadership that put off blame yet they accuse everyone below them of lying. Regarding the event, when I asked my manager why I wasn't attending, she said it wasn't her decision, it was the event coordinator's decision. So I ask the event coordinator why I wasn't attending and he says it wasn't his decision, it was my manager's decision. Regarding a different event, management told us to lie to donors and tell them we were raising funds for X beneficiaries (because people were more empathetic towards them) even though we were really raising the funds for Y beneficiaries. Early in my employment, my manager told me to launch a project but stopped me half way through and told me it was a waste of resources. Months later, stakeholders asked why this project was never finished and my manager throws me under the bus in a CC'd email stating ""why did you abandon this project? It was supposed to be done months ago! Go complete it now!"". Yet the one time I told my manager I completed a task but forgot to log my work, she called me a liar in a meeting with HR and said I was too untrustworthy to be employed, which resulted in me being put under a performance review.

11. The entire board is made up of close personal friends of the CEO and they're the only ones that make the decision of keeping him or firing him. All of the employees that got fired reporting the CEO was due to the friends of his on the board.

12. Just in this year alone, we've had a total of 6 employees so far who quit on the spot or were fired and left on extremely bad terms (the entire org is only 12 employees, so that's half of the staff there). Previous years follow the same pattern; anyone who has ever left the org either by choice or force has had the org entirely burn that bridge. But when the org becomes desperate for staff, they reach out to those same employees with a lowball contractor offer and expect them to say yes.

13. The org pays volunteers way more than their employees. There is constantly a push for long term ""volunteers"" but it was discovered that these volunteers are being paid more hourly than most employees. The entire purpose of a volunteer is someone willing to contribute without financial compensation.

14. The CEO constantly mispronounces people's names. This point doesn't have as much magnitude as other points but it's pretty disrespectful to have people on your team for months and continuously butcher their name, even though their names are being said properly by other staff AND are written on the zoom calls. It almost seems like a power move to belittle the person, considering how narcissistic he is.

15. There is an annual retreat for all employees (staff and management). It's the one time where the company takes care of the staff and rewards them for their hard work. We get to travel to a new site each year and really enjoy our time. This year, they claimed they don't have the budget for it yet everyone in management got to have a leadership retreat. In turn, we are still having a retreat but it's a low budget retreat held over an all day zoom call on a SATURDAY and we're all required to attend.

16. When there are work conferences, we are expected to share rooms. I didn't think too much of this at first because I went to a lot of conferences in high school and had to share a room but I realized that was IN HIGH SCHOOL, not a professional environment. A few people who have traveled for work before brought up to me that it's incredibly inappropriate to have us share rooms and the more I thought about it, the more I agree. Every employee is remote so when there are conferences, we're having to share a room with a complete stranger. It's incredibly inconvenient to have to be up early, stand on your feet all day, and then go back to share a room with a stranger who keeps you up all night with their snoring. After the most recent convention, I found out that my manager got her own room which in return gave the other coworker (who was supposed to bunk with her) her own room. Yet when I asked for my own accommodation due to a medical reason, my manager told me I had to pay for my own room out of pocket. I asked her why then she and the other employee each got to have their own rooms, she said ""because we both like having our privacy"".

17. Response times from management are practically non-existent yet a high standard is placed on staff. Management takes DAYS to respond to a request and when you don't finish a task because you are pending their response, they report you to HR for poor performance. Yet when they message staff at 4:52 pm on Friday, asking for a big task, the employee is required to reply within a few minutes and expected to start on the assignment since it was ""technically"" assigned before then end of the workday and continue it over the weekend before the next workday or else we'll look like we're slacking. My manager reported me to HR for taking 40 minutes to respond to her message (I was on my lunch break) but I have been waiting 2.5 weeks for her to approve my project charter.

18. The CEO makes jokes about us getting limited holidays off. Unlike most companies, we only receive less than half of the calendared holidays off. When someone recently made a remark in a meeting about going to the beach on Columbus day, the CEO laughed and said ""You wish you had Columbus day off! You all already get enough days off"". So we're required to work on a federal holiday and he makes a remark about how he's going golfing with his buddies while we ""hold down the fort"".

19. Staff with children get way more perks and excuses than those who don't. Regardless of my job, I have always been extremely against people using their children as an excuse out of work mostly because people really tend to abuse that excuse. One incident, I got sick in the middle of the work day and began vomiting so I had to cancel all my meetings for the day. My manager called me unprofessional and said I was required to request the day off at least 48 hours prior (as if I scheduled my stomach virus in advance) yet other employees with kids, MULTIPLE times week, take half days without informing anyone in advance ""to pick up their kids from school"", leave meetings early because ""their kids want a snack"", reschedule meetings last minute because ""their kids got fussy"" and management + the CEO completely turn a blind eye.

These are just a HANDFUL of things that I've seen in the short time I've been employed with this organization. I had volunteered for this organization years prior when it was under completely different leadership and really liked the mission - which is what led me to apply for a job.

My first red flag is when the person who's job I replaced was training me, she called me and vented for hours about how toxic this work place was. I convinced myself that each person has their own experience but to be honest, I just really needed the money and health insurance.

I told myself that I'll just ride it out until I find a better opportunity. So I am currently looking for other employment though it's difficult considering most companies are in office and I have very niche experience. I don't know how long I can mentally stay in this job but I do know that once I leave, either by choice or force, I am going to burn the organization to the ground.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1o0y76q,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1o0y76q/every_day_is_a_loss/,Every day is a loss.,"Sorry if this is long I literally don’t know where else to go. 

I lost my early twenties to an illness that got out of control due to my doctors dismissing symptoms that were progressing for years. My parents, who I limited contact by this point with, suggested their primary doctor. I saw him for about 4 minutes, during which he looked up the doctors who *were* trying to help me and made fun of them, explained why he was a better doctor. He did not follow through on sending any testing for me, although he said he would. I called multiple times with no luck, no testing was ordered. I went back in, hoping to get the testing pushed through. By this point my symptoms were getting very severe. I demanded he try to help me, and he pushed back about why he shouldn’t. This was a 2 minute appointment- he threatened to commit me if I didn’t let him call my parents to “ask about my behavior at home”, he called them and actually shared that he was diagnosing me with two serious psychiatric conditions I had never hit criteria for and still don’t. Even though he is a primary doctor and technically a nephrologist. He insisted they try to commit me to a psychiatric ward of his choosing. My parents believed the doctor, not me. I had to fight my way to helping my freedom so I could receive real medical care. I was so scared of dying in the psych ward because I would be tested for these mental illnesses and not what was happening to my body. They did not care. They would not help me unless I would commit myself. 

I reached out to friends for support, it turned out they weren’t friends. I skips have known since they were coworkers first. They told everybody I had these conditions and I was in denial. It ruined my professional reputation. 

I was so scared, my body was genuinely deteriorating in front of my eyes, and all the people I would have put my neck on the line for were busy laughing about me. I lost so much weight my bmi was 17. My first bought of weight loss was 5 years prior to this one but not nearly as bad. They still laughed, said I couldn’t care for myself with such conditions. 

I was traumatized, I was alone. I had to quit the job I loved and was so proud to have. I couldn’t leave my house. I lost my ability to spatially understand a room- and so many more symptoms. I felt disgusting every second. I couldn’t go back to the doctor- I was so scared of being committed. I was scared of them stripping me off of my mental health medication (already had a psychiatrist- this is how I know I never hit criteria for the diagnosis of the doctor who traumatized me). The meds I take can contribute to weight loss, but I took them successfully for so long before this bought. And they really changed my life. For the very first time, I had actually felt true happiness. I was able to trust people. My people pleasing tendencies were almost gone. The mental load and pain I felt everyday was finally lifted. I was motivated, I was happy, I was cooking well and drinking fancy water. I finally felt human when I started them. I was terrified that the end of my life would be *that* pain coming back, on top of endless dismissal while I cried out for real medical help, committed to a psych ward. 

I was too scared to see a doctor again. Functionally I was almost at 0%. Every thing was hard to do. Just making a cup of coffee. I would spill everything, I would miss the mark when pouring stuff.. I didn’t know what was happening. 

One day, I absolutely knew I was on my death bed. I remember thinking I should write letters to loved ones before reminding myself only my husband was left. 

My husband finally just dragged my near lifeless body to an urgent care and sat with me, vouching for my symptoms to the doctor. Finally I had real medical help- I was on strong medication for many months. I finally gained a little weight back. I was so traumatized though, just thinking about going to the doctor I would shake. I took my meds. Since it was an urgent care, I had to find more long term care afterward as the doctor didn’t know why my body wasn’t clearing it out faster. I was so scared I didn’t see another doctor for months, but slowly I kept recovering. 

I’m almost 27 now. My first symptoms were 18-19 years old, the worst was at 23. I just recently feel I’m about 99% better with some lingering damage I can only hope subsides with time. 

Now that my physical health is better, I’m left without the distracting of trying to save my life. I sit here with my thoughts, with my mental pain of being just thrown out like garbage by my loved ones when I need help the most. I sit and I think, and I stare. I cry. I lost all but one of the people who meant the most to me. 

Seeing pictures of me when my illness was at a point where I could still function- where I believed the doctors that it was anxiety and would ignore my symptoms- when I trusted others- when I was happy- when life felt so worth living- when I was grateful for every moment, she looks so fucking happy. She looks so nice.  She looks like someone I would look up to now. She looks powerful to me now. I feel so small. They all think I’m a joke. All because one doctor, who broke HIPPA, and did not do one single test, diagnosed me wrongly outside of his scope of practice. 

I’ve always been the one to stand up in a situation and stand up for someone being wronged, and not even just that, I would take it *far*. I made sure the person being wronged knew someone was on their side every single time. I would have fought for any of the people who hurt me so badly. It felt like watching a pathetic sad movie, it felt like the saddest twilight zone. I think that’s why this is so painful for me- I’ve always found it so important to support people and to make sure they knew I was in their corner. And I had almost nobody left. 

I should have been out with friends, I should have been working and saving money. Instead, I was hoping and praying that I would be able to keep my dinner down. I was hoping and praying my vision would return to normal. I was hoping and praying my family would come back to me. I was hoping and praying for one person to say “hey, this is wrong”. 

My family still sees that doctor to this day, occasionally they’ve even compliment him in front of me as if they’re testing me. My dad has cancer now, and I wouldn’t want him to interrupt his medical care I guess. Even though what they did is so wrong, they’re still my parents. I don’t say anything- I feel like I have to pick between having a family and standing for my truth. Although contact is still limited, I almost convince myself they mean well.  But I’ve done so much standing up for others, why is it still my turn to do it? They talked me out of suing him for HIPPA violation, they told me I wouldn’t get anywhere, I would lose my money, I would just be laughed at again. My fear of dismissal was so intense, I believed them. 

I have to accept I’ll never get an apology, but how do I do that? It’s not a world I thought I would ever live in, it hurts me to not stand my moral ground but I don’t even have the care to. 

Being physically better has left me with so much time to reflect on what happened. 

Every day I’m scared. I wake up scared. I go to bed scared. I go to work scared. I can’t work full days anymore. My body isn’t what it used to be although I am recovered I will likely have some nerve damage for at minimum a very long time. I’m terrified every day. I’m terrified of people, I used to love people. It was my favorite thing about me. 

My clients remind me of what happened, my tools remind me of what happened. What I do is my favorite thing, I love my job and I love my life. But I don’t feel the love for it anymore. I feel terror. I pick up a tool, and suddenly everyone I love is laughing at me again. Suddenly I’m dying again.  Suddenly I can’t swallow, suddenly I’m being dismissed. I see a client who has supported me for many years, suddenly I’m losing everyone I love, my body, my vision, my spatial awareness. It all comes back to me. Physically, I am okay. But mentally, I am on my deathbed *again*. 

I can’t let my family go, but it almost feels like if I don’t I will be killing myself. I dream about the day I get just one single “sorry” from anybody. It won’t come. I don’t know how to accept that. 

I went from saving for my future, to not having hot water and dodging debt collectors. To getting medical bills in the mail I knew I couldn’t pay. To being sued by the hospital for money I didn’t have. 

I went from doing fancy makeup every day, to not wanting to shower or cook for myself. 

I really miss who she was. I really miss my life before this happened. 

I keep telling myself that time heals all wounds, but in just a moment I can be back at square one. Sitting on my bed, crying, wondering why nobody will believe me while I get sicker. Knowing that nobody cares that I’m dying. Knowing they’re laughing at me about it. Knowing they’re blaming me for it. Knowing that advocating for myself equals psychiatric commitment. 

I do not know what to do. I do not know where to turn. I do not have any plans for my future anymore. It feels like the future isn’t real when I keep getting pulled into the past. I’m resentful. I’m sad. I’m empty. I’m so broken. This will never go away. I have nothing. I had a head start on things, now I have nothing. 

I just really don’t know.  I have no desires, I have nothing but resentment and confusion about how this happened to me. ",1,1759889107.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False

Fb marketplace started showing me devices and a lot of YouTube videos later I think I'm ready to buy something.

My current setup is just a regular Nespresso machine which I use the espresso pods along with some boiled milk which I use a hand frother to make that amazing cup of cappuccino that looks great in photos. However recently I've realized that it's been about 3 years now and I've used a lot of pods... I want to waste less and I'm sure there is something that isn't good for me preserving

it.

My current thinking is to get a breville Bambino (hopefully plus model) and a good grinder (df54 seems to be the rage).

I think I also need these things but don't exactly know what or why yet: Wdt Tool, bottomless portafilter, dosing funnel, distributor.

I've bought a 1kg bean pack of lavazza crema e aroma 8/10 intensity from Costco which I'm now guessing isn't going to give me good coffee.

I'm just looking for good espresso and cappuccino...what exactly is good, I can't say I know yet. I'm pretty content with the Nespresso. I just don't like the waste and possible health issues.

1o0y4yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1o0y4yc/a_blast_from_the_present_the_naked_gun_2025/,A Blast From the Present: The Naked Gun (2025),"My history: I heard about the first Naked Gun movie around the time it came out; I found it outrageously scandalous that it used the word ‘naked,’ which to 5-year-old me was barely short of actual obscenity. I of course never saw that movie, or either of the sequels, though I once used a soundless version of [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-S-eeInJVk), in a writing class I taught, as a way of showing how saying less can convey things better than merely stating things.\*1 (It’s a shame [Christopher Nolan](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/oa03k1/tenet/) skipped that week.)

Some years ago, I had occasion to point out that Leslie Nielsen’s comedy career was actually a second act for him; he was a serious dramatic actor for decades before Airplane! (most famously, he played the captain in The Forbidden Planet), and was cast in Airplane! largely because of the hilarious contrast of seeing such a serious actor in such a thoroughly goofy production. It worked rather too well; he made nothing but goofy comedies for the next 20+ years, and nowadays his more serious work is almost entirely forgotten (though in fairness, it was never all that famous), which greatly blunts the joke.

I wracked my brain for a modern equivalent, an actor known for serious work whose mere presence in a madcap comedy would be a major joke in and of itself. I thought of one who had decades of very serious dramatic work under his belt (first rising to fame on the back of perhaps the most serious Holocaust movie ever made, no less), with the added bonus of spending the last decade-plus in very un-serious work where he nevertheless always plays the same grouchy, angry, humorless character that you can’t imagine cracking a joke, or even being in the same room as anyone who’s ever smiled: Liam Neeson.

I am therefore inordinately proud that someone with actual power had the same idea, and liked it enough to bring it to life, and that it all worked out as well as it did.

I’m persuaded by the argument that this was the [most important movie of the summer](https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/the-naked-gun-most-important-movie-of-the-summer-1235136672/). Movie comedy is indeed a [precious heritage worth preserving and perpetuating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3mVQxPzsq0), and apart from that and perhaps more importantly, we need to richly reward this movie’s decision to give its geriatric male star a vaguely age-appropriate love interest.\*2

.

I saw this movie in a theater in late August ([I’ve](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n4x36q/the_grand_summer_project_the_data_dump_part_1x/) [been](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n51e5r/grand_summer_project_the_data_dump_part_2x/) [pretty](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n521pn/grand_summer_project_the_data_dump_part_3x/) [busy](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n52q47/grand_summer_project_data_dump_part_4x/) [with](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n539gv/grand_summer_project_datadump_part_5x/) [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n53n6k/grand_summer_project_data_dump_part_66/) [matters](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n597rm/the_grand_summer_project_comparison_part_1x/) [since](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n59k8u/the_grand_summer_project_comparison_part_2x/) [then](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n5a3eb/the_grand_summer_project_evaluation_part_3x/); [I’m](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n5b3uj/the_grand_summer_project_comparison_part_4x/) [kind](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n5bzau/the_grand_summer_project_comparison_part_5x/) [of](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n7147a/the_grand_summer_project_comparison_part_6x/) [surprised](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n747jg/grand_summer_project_comparison_part_7x/) [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1n7yz1t/grand_summer_project_comparison_part_8x/) [got](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1nb85lt/grand_summer_project_comparison_part_9x/) [around](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1nb8ji9/grand_summer_project_comparison_part_1010/) [to](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1nf9676/knightfall/) [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1nje541/batman_the_cult/) [at](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1numrob/the_dark_knight_returns/) [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1nwjoyo/the_dark_knight_rises/)), which treated me to an unpleasant experience that I’m glad to have had. You see, I was raised to believe that movies were not to be trusted, and that a great many of them were outright evil. On the few childhood occasions that I saw a movie in a theater, I often spent the minutes before the title card consumed by anxiety bordering on terror: what if I’d gone into the wrong screening room? What if the projectionist was playing the wrong movie? Was I about to see one of those forbidden outright-evil movies, something that would permanently besmirch my eternal soul?

Fortunately I’ve long since gotten over the idea that watching a movie can do that to a person, and the idea that eternal souls exist at all, and pretty much the entire complex of ideas and beliefs and assumptions that led to that particular childhood anxiety (and pretty much [all the other ones I experienced](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/1071729)), to the point that I hadn’t thought about it in years. But the first few seconds of this movie brought it all back; it opens with a Hans-Zimmer-esque industrial soundtrack fit for a humorless action movie, and I briefly wondered if I was somehow watching the wrong movie, and then remembered my terrible, anxiety-ridden history with that question. It all turned out fine: I was indeed watching the movie I was there to see,\*3 it was using the action-movie soundtrack ironically, and even if I’d been watching the wrong movie, what’s the worst that could come of that? A few minutes of mildly Karen-like behavior to get my ticket refunded? Certainly nothing worth any amount of actual stress.

Unpleasant as they can be, I kind of appreciate moments like this; I think the occasional reminder of how much my life has improved is a good and healthy thing.

.

The movie itself is quite funny. ‘P.L.O.T. device’ got a laugh out of me in the first 30 seconds, and it just kept going from there (though I do feel like the pace kind of slackened later in the movie). I bet it gets better on rewatch: this seems like the kind of movie where every square inch of the background is loaded with jokes that are easy to miss. Two I noticed: the cop cars are all emblazoned with ‘To Warm and Serve’ instead of ‘To Serve and Protect,’ and one of the sponsor logos on the floor of the cage fight, alongside all the cryptocurrency scams and energy drinks one might expect, is NPR. And the jokes in the foreground are pretty good, too: “True-crime books, based on stories I make up,” and the dueling sting operations, and the coffee cups that appear as if by magic, and the windshield gag, and the combat performance of the guy who wants to live by the Primal Law of Toughness, and the extensive [Sex and the City](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/170i4de/and_just_like_thatseason_2/) reference that comes out of nowhere, and the TiVo-related distraction…lots of good stuff here.

All that said, it’s kind of uncomfortable to have a lighthearted comedy where an unhinged and violent rogue cop gets to be the hero. He is often the butt of jokes, and over-ambitious billionaires are justly villainized and mocked, so it’s not as bad as it could be, but it’s still not as good as it could be.

.

How to fix it: keep Drebin as the butt of jokes, but don’t let him be the hero. Have the bank-robbery situation be well in hand before he shows up to cause violent mayhem that explicitly allows the main bad guy to escape with the PLOT device. Had Drebin done nothing, the cops would’ve kept the exits covered, all the robbers would have been apprehended, the PLOT device would have been recovered, and the whole apocalypse thing would’ve been nipped in the bud, all with very much less violence. Give Drebin a series of colleagues who do law enforcement and investigation the right way. For example, a master of disguise who does him up like a schoolgirl for the bank scene, but then is outraged at Drebin’s abuse of their work; and some real detectives (who are mostly not cops) who effectively do their thing, mostly offscreen and unbeknownst to the audience, while Drebin blunders around. Said blundering often puts him at odds with the brass, as in the real movie, but the brass’s hearts really aren’t in reining him in. A supremely slimy PBA lawyer keeps trying to step in to defend Drebin, but Drebin is not having it; utterly despising this lawyer is the one thing that he and the brass and all other cops and every ‘anti-police radical’ can agree on.

The grand finale should involve Drebin having a goal in mind and completely failing at it, whatever it is. If this scene involves him getting pantsed in front of an audience of thousands (and why shouldn’t it?), the movie should go out of its way to point out how small, not how large, his dick is. Then the real detectives enter the scene and actually save the day, and reveal in a flashback that redoes the entire movie in 2 minutes that they’ve been pursuing the actual case all along (it was something Drebin never knew anything about; this will be the first he even hears about the PLOT device), and many of the clues and leads Drebin saw were false, fed to him by the real detectives to keep him out of their way. For example, they interrogated the few surviving bank robbers (using only valid, torture-free interrogation techniques) and got a wealth of information out of that; then they hired some actors to impersonate the suspects and let Drebin torture false information out of them. But true to Drebin’s vast incompetence, he couldn’t even follow a dummy lead right, and kept blundering back into the real detectives’ way, to the point that his whole grand finale actually threatened to thwart them and allow the triumph of evil.

Instead of ending up in an Internal Affairs paradise, Drebin ends up in department-mandated arbitration for the many crimes he committed along the way, that one super-slimy PBA lawyer being his only hope of salvation. This is of course a much better fate than he had any right to expect (he really should just be in a normal jail, dependent on an overworked public defender just like so many of his victims), but of course he will see it as a the literal worst thing that has ever happened to anyone, and that sense of entitlement is something else the movie can lampoon.

\*1 I’d like to claim credit for the insight that the clip works better without sound, but alas: the classroom just wasn’t wired for sound, so I had to do it in silence, and it all being funnier and more interesting and a better teachable moment without sound was just dumb luck.

\*2 But not really. Despite Pam Anderson’s advanced age, she’s still 15 years younger than Liam Neeson. Baby steps; it’s not ideal that the 73-year-old protagonist has a 58-year-old love interest, but some credit is due to whichever hero risked their career to make sure the love interest would be 58 instead of 22.

1o0y323,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1o0y323/how_i_went_from_reading_0_books_to_50_books_a/,How I went from reading 0 books to 50+ books a year (without speed reading bs),"two years ago i was one of those people who bought books and let them collect dust. had a whole shelf of ""books i'll read someday"" that never got touched. now i'm reading 4-5 books a month and actually retaining what i read. here's how i cracked the code:

the mindset shift that changed everything:

* stopped trying to read ""impressive"" books and started reading stuff i actually wanted to read. turns out enjoying what ur reading makes u want to read more (who knew)
* realized reading 10 mins a day consistently beats reading 3 hours once a week. consistency > intensity
* gave myself permission to quit books that sucked. life's too short for boring books, there's literally millions of other options
* started treating books like netflix - if i'm not hooked in the first 30 pages, i move on. no guilt, no forcing it

the practical systems that actually work:

* always have 3 books going: one physical, one audiobook, one ebook. different moods, different formats
* bought a kindle paperwhite and it changed my life. reading in bed without disturbing anyone, built-in light, holds thousands of books
* started using library apps (libby is a game changer). free books delivered to ur phone, what's not to love
* created a ""books to read"" note in my phone. when someone recommends something or i see an interesting title, i add it immediately

the habit stacking stuff:

* read while drinking my morning coffee. 15-20 mins every day, no exceptions
* audiobooks during commute, walks, doing dishes, working out. turns dead time into reading time
* keep a book in my bag always. waiting for appointments, delayed flights, random free moments = reading opportunities
* read for 10 mins before bed instead of scrolling. better sleep + more books, win-win

the environment hacks:

* made reading more appealing than my phone. comfy reading spot, good lighting, put the phone in another room
* started going to bookstores/libraries just to browse. being around books makes u want to read them
* joined a book club (online one bc social anxiety). having to discuss books makes u actually think about them
* unfollowed book reviewers who made me feel bad about my reading choices. read what u want, not what's ""supposed"" to be good

the retention tricks:

* started keeping a reading journal. not fancy, just a few sentences about what i learned or thought about each book
* began taking notes while reading (especially non-fiction). kindle makes this super easy
* started telling people about books i'm reading. explaining stuff to others helps cement it in ur brain
* created a ""book graveyard"" list of books i didn't finish. helps me remember what didn't work and why

the advanced stuff:

* learned about different reading speeds for different content. skim self-help for main points, savor fiction for experience
* started reading book summaries AFTER finishing books to see what i missed. helps improve comprehension over time
* began choosing books based on what i'm dealing with in life. relationship issues? read about psychology. career stress? read about productivity
* discovered ""book sprints"" - dedicating a whole saturday to finishing one book. surprisingly effective for shorter books

the counterintuitive stuff:

* stopped setting yearly reading goals. pressure killed the enjoyment, made it feel like work
* started re-reading favorite books. repetition with favorites > constantly consuming new mediocre content
* began reading multiple books in the same topic area. reinforces concepts and gives different perspectives
* learned that it's okay to read ""easy"" books. young adult fiction counts, graphic novels count, everything counts

what didn't work:

* speed reading courses - just made me anxious and killed comprehension
* forcing myself to read before bed when i was exhausted - just made me hate reading
* trying to read only ""important"" books - boredom killed the habit before it started
* reading in noisy environments - couldn't focus, got frustrated, gave up

went from maybe 2-3 books a year to 50+ books. not just reading more, but actually enjoying it and remembering what i read. brain feels sharper, conversations are more interesting, and i have way more perspective on stuff.

1o0y23w,https://imgur.com/a/Qw9GyK4,"Fairytale castles in the vicinity of Gießen, Hesse, Germany: Runkel and Gleiberg","I recently had the opportunity to spend a few days in Gießen, a university town about an hour north of Frankfurt. Gießen itself is a lovely spot, and a great jumping point to see some beautiful sights in the nearby area. 

The train from Gießen to Runkel is direct and the scenery was so beautiful. Runkel castle is well set up for visitors with a self-guided tour that takes you through the courtyard and up 141 steep and narrow stairs to the top of the tour, with a 360 degree view of the surrounding countryside. Highly recommend a stop for quiche and coffee at the Altstadt-Café around the corner. 

Gleiberg castle is much closer to Gießen, and a car would have made the journey a breeze - but the bus got us there in about 20 minutes. You'll be tempted to get off the bus at the first Gleiberg stop. Don't do it, it's a 25 minute walk straight up a hill! Wait a few more stops until you're further up Burgstraße to save your legs for the tower climb. The Gleiberg ruins are free to roam around. In the distance you'll be able to see another castle in Vetzburg. The Gleiberg grounds have a restaurant out front for a beer overlooking the view.

The transit from Frankfurt to these castles would be a trek, but worth it if you have a car or time on your hands. Astonishing countryside and fascinating history.",1,1759888704.0,travel,1,1.0,False

A few days ago, I'm walking down my block, and I see this African American guy. He immediately starts talking to me. He goes ""Are you good!"" As if he knew me or something or was my friend.... I replied ""Yes I'm good, mind your business."" Then I kept walking. 

Today I see him AGAIN but in a donut shop near me. I didn't recognize him at first but then as he kept talking it clicked in my head... This is the SAME guy that asked me if I'm good a few days ago. He randomly buys me a coffee, as my friend is sat accross from me and hands me his cell phone ...(Weird)

He says ""I need help getting this RV, maybe you can talk to this guy for me...""  In front of me I see this random conversation between the two of them. I'm sat there dumbfounded, he literally just left me with his phone as he walked to the donut counter again. He comes back and says ""You need to figure this out for me."" I said, ""look man, I'm sorry, but I don't know anything about this..."" He muttered something but I forgot what he said then left. 

I recognized his car because it was the same one he was standing by when he asked me if I was good a couple days ago. I took a photo of his license plate. 

Now I'm extremely paranoid that I'm gonna bump into him again and that he's gonna bother me. I feel nervous about walking in my neighborhood now and have been anxious all evening.

# Choosing The Right Coffee Beans

Choosing the right coffee beans is key to making delicious cold brew coffee at home. The beans affect the flavor, strength, and smoothness of your brew. Different beans bring different tastes, from fruity and bright to rich and chocolatey. Picking the right type and grind size helps you get the best cold brew experience. This section explains which beans suit cold brew and why grind size matters.

# Bean Types For Cold Brew

[Cold brew coffee](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-to-use-for-cold-brew/) tastes best with beans that offer smooth and balanced flavors. Dark roast beans are popular for cold brew because they have a rich, bold taste with less acidity. Light roast beans have more fruity and floral notes, but their bright acidity can be less smooth in cold brew. Medium roasts strike a good balance between flavor and smoothness.

Here are common bean types used for cold brew:

* **Dark Roast:** Bold, chocolatey, low acidity, smooth finish.
* **Medium Roast:** Balanced flavor, moderate acidity, nutty and sweet notes.
* **Light Roast:** Bright, fruity, higher acidity, floral flavors.
* **Single Origin:** Unique flavors depending on the region, often more complex.
* **Blends:** Mix of beans for a consistent and well-rounded taste.

The choice depends on personal preference. Dark roasts often suit those who want a smooth and rich cup. Light roasts work well if you enjoy fruity and vibrant flavors. Medium roasts offer versatility for many cold brew drinkers.

|Bean Type|Flavor Profile|Acidity|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dark Roast|Bold, chocolate, smoky|Low|Smooth, rich cold brew|
|Medium Roast|Balanced, nutty, sweet|Medium|Everyday cold brew|
|Light Roast|Fruity, floral, bright|High|Vibrant, fruity cold brew|

# Grinding Size Importance

Grinding size plays a major role in the taste and quality of cold brew coffee. Cold brew uses a long steeping time, so the grind needs to be coarse. Coarse grounds allow water to flow slowly and extract flavors evenly. Fine grounds can cause over-extraction, making the coffee bitter and muddy.

Use a burr grinder for consistent coarse grind. Blade grinders create uneven sizes, leading to uneven extraction. Coarse grounds look similar to sea salt or breadcrumbs. This size helps prevent clogging your filter and keeps the brew clear.

Here is why grind size matters:

1. **Extraction Rate:** Coarse grind slows extraction, preventing bitterness.
2. **Clarity:** Coarse grounds reduce sediment in the cold brew.
3. **Flavor Balance:** Even extraction gives smooth, rich flavor.
4. **Ease of Filtering:** Coarse grounds filter easily without clogging.

Try these tips for grinding your beans:

* Use a burr grinder set to coarse.
* Avoid espresso or drip grind sizes.
* Test your grind by feeling the texture; it should be rough and chunky.
* If brew tastes bitter, try grinding coarser next time.

# Essential Equipment

Making cold brew coffee at home requires some basic tools to get started. The right equipment helps you brew smooth and rich coffee with ease. This section explains the essential items needed for making cold brew. Whether you want a simple setup or a more specialized one, knowing the equipment helps save time and effort.

# Cold Brew Makers

Cold brew makers are designed to make the brewing process simple and mess-free. These devices combine brewing and filtering in one unit. They usually have a container for steeping coffee grounds and a built-in filter to separate the liquid.

**Key features of cold brew makers:**

* Easy to use and clean
* Reusable filters save money
* Compact design fits in most refrigerators
* Made from glass, plastic, or stainless steel

Here is a comparison table of common cold brew maker types:

|Type|Material|Filter Type|Approximate Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Glass Cold Brew Maker|Glass|Metal or Nylon|$20 – $40|
|Plastic Cold Brew Maker|BPA-Free Plastic|Reusable Mesh|$15 – $30|
|Stainless Steel Cold Brew Maker|Stainless Steel|Fine Mesh|$40 – $70|

Cold brew makers help maintain a clean brewing area and prevent coffee grounds from spilling. They are perfect for beginners and experts alike. Having one saves time because you do not need extra filters or strainers.

# Alternative Tools

[Cold brew coffee](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-to-use-for-cold-brew/) can be made without a specialized maker. Common kitchen tools can do the job well, especially if you want to experiment or do not want to buy new items. Using alternative tools makes cold brew accessible to everyone.

Here are some common alternative tools:

* **Large Jar or Pitcher:** Use a glass jar or pitcher with a lid to steep coffee grounds in water.
* **Fine Mesh Sieve:** Strain the coffee to remove large grounds after brewing.
* **Cheesecloth or Nut Milk Bag:** Use these to filter smaller particles and get a smooth brew.
* **French Press:** Steep coffee grounds in cold water and press to separate grounds from coffee.

Steps to make cold brew with alternative tools:

1. Add coarsely ground coffee to a jar or pitcher.
2. Pour cold water over the grounds and stir gently.
3. Cover the container and let it steep in the fridge for 12-24 hours.
4. Strain the coffee using a sieve, cheesecloth, or French press.
5. Store the filtered coffee in a clean container.

Using these tools requires more effort but saves money. It also lets you control the brewing process fully. This method works well for small or large batches and can fit any kitchen setup.

# Step-by-step Brewing Process

Making cold brew coffee at home is simple and rewarding. The step-by-step brewing process ensures a smooth, rich flavor without bitterness. Cold brew needs patience but little effort. Follow clear steps to measure, mix, steep, and filter your coffee. This guide breaks down each stage to help you brew the perfect cold coffee at home.

# Measuring Coffee And Water

Start by measuring the right amount of coffee and water. The ratio affects the strength and taste of your cold brew. A common ratio is **1:4** for a concentrate or **1:8** for ready-to-drink coffee. Use coarsely ground coffee for best results. Fine grounds can cause bitterness and clog filters.

Here is a simple table for coffee and water amounts:

|Type|Coffee (grams)|Water (milliliters)|Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Concentrate|100|400|1:4|
|Ready-to-Drink|50|400|1:8|

Use a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, use about 1 cup of coffee grounds for every 4 cups of water for concentrate. Adjust based on taste. Cold brew is forgiving, so slight changes won’t ruin it.

# Mixing And Steeping Time

Mix coffee grounds with cold or room temperature water. Use a large jar or pitcher. Stir gently to make sure all grounds are wet. Avoid vigorous shaking to prevent over-extraction.

Cover the container to prevent any outside odors from affecting the brew. Steep the mixture in the fridge or at room temperature. Steeping time usually ranges from **12 to 24 hours**. Longer steeping results in stronger flavor.

Use this guide for steeping:

* **12 hours:** Light flavor, smooth taste
* **16 hours:** Balanced, good strength
* **20-24 hours:** Strong, full-bodied coffee

Test your brew after 12 hours. Taste it and decide if you want to steep more. Cold brew is less acidic and bitter because of the slow extraction. Patience improves flavor.

# Filtering The Brew

After steeping, filter the coffee to remove grounds. Use a fine mesh sieve, coffee filter, or a nut milk bag. Filtering twice helps get a smooth, sediment-free coffee.

Follow these steps:

1. Place a sieve over a clean jar or pitcher.
2. Pour the cold brew slowly through the sieve.
3. For finer filtering, pour the strained coffee through a paper filter or cloth.
4. Discard the used coffee grounds or compost them.

Store the filtered cold brew in the fridge. It lasts up to 2 weeks. Serve over ice or dilute with water or milk if needed. Filtering well keeps the taste pure and the texture smooth. Enjoy your homemade cold brew anytime.

# Storage Tips

Storing cold brew coffee properly keeps its rich flavor and freshness. Good storage stops it from going bad quickly. Knowing the right methods helps enjoy your cold brew longer and taste great every time.

# Refrigeration Guidelines

Cold brew coffee should always be kept in the refrigerator. The cool temperature slows down bacteria growth and keeps the coffee fresh. Store it in a clean, airtight container to avoid absorbing other fridge smells.

* **Use glass or BPA-free plastic containers.** These materials do not affect the coffee’s taste.
* **Seal the container tightly.** This stops air from spoiling the coffee.
* **Keep the coffee away from strong-smelling foods.** Coffee easily takes on other odors.
* **Place the container on a middle or top shelf.** Avoid the fridge door, where temperature changes often.

Label the container with the date you made the cold brew. This helps track how long it has been stored.

|Storage Tip|Reason|
|:-|:-|
|Use airtight container|Prevents air and odors from affecting taste|
|Store in fridge, not freezer|Freezing changes texture and flavor|
|Keep away from fridge door|Temperature stays more stable inside|

# Shelf Life Expectations

Cold brew coffee stays fresh for several days if stored properly. It tastes best within the first week. After this, flavor and quality start to drop.

Fresh cold brew usually lasts:

1. **3 to 5 days** for best taste and aroma.
2. **Up to 2 weeks** if kept sealed and cold.

After two weeks, the coffee can develop a sour or stale taste. Avoid drinking cold brew that smells off or tastes bitter.

|Storage Duration|Quality Level|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0-5 days|Excellent|Best flavor and freshness|
|6-14 days|Good|Flavor starts to weaken|
|15+ days|Poor|May taste sour or stale|

For longer storage, freeze cold brew in ice cube trays. Thaw cubes when needed. This method keeps the coffee usable for months but may change its texture.

# Serving Suggestions

Serving cold brew coffee at home is a simple pleasure that anyone can enjoy. This smooth, rich coffee tastes great on its own but shines brightest with some creative touches. Serving suggestions help turn your cold brew into a refreshing drink perfect for any time of day. You can keep it classic or experiment with flavors and textures. Here are some ideas to make your cold brew experience even better.

# Cold Brew Variations

Cold brew coffee is versatile. You can enjoy it in many different ways, depending on your mood and taste. Try these variations to keep your cold brew exciting:

* **Classic Cold Brew:** Serve over ice with a splash of water or milk.
* **Cold Brew Latte:** Mix cold brew with chilled milk or a milk alternative. Use a 1:1 ratio for a creamy texture.
* **Iced Mocha:** Add chocolate syrup and milk to cold brew. Top with whipped cream for extra indulgence.
* **Cold Brew Tonic:** Combine cold brew with tonic water and ice. Garnish with a slice of lemon for a fizzy twist.
* **Frozen Cold Brew:** Blend cold brew with ice cubes for a slushy coffee treat.

|Variation|Key Ingredients|Taste Profile|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Classic Cold Brew|Cold brew, ice, water/milk|Smooth, mild, refreshing|
|Cold Brew Latte|Cold brew, milk, ice|Creamy, rich, balanced|
|Iced Mocha|Cold brew, chocolate syrup, milk, whipped cream|Sweet, chocolaty, indulgent|
|Cold Brew Tonic|Cold brew, tonic water, lemon slice|Bright, fizzy, refreshing|
|Frozen Cold Brew|Cold brew, ice cubes|Cold, slushy, energizing|

Experiment with these ideas to find your favorite cold brew style. Use different milk types or sweeteners to suit your taste. Serving cold brew in a tall glass with ice keeps it cool longer. Add a straw or a spoon to stir flavors well. Presentation matters as much as flavor.

# Adding Flavors And Sweeteners

Cold brew coffee has a smooth, naturally sweet taste. You can enhance it with extra flavors and sweeteners. These additions make the drink more enjoyable without overpowering the coffee’s rich notes.

Try these flavor options:

* **Vanilla Extract:** Add a few drops for a warm, sweet aroma.
* **Cinnamon:** Sprinkle ground cinnamon or use a cinnamon stick for spiced notes.
* **Nutmeg:** A pinch adds a subtle, nutty flavor.
* **Mint:** Fresh mint leaves give a cool, refreshing taste.
* **Cocoa Powder:** Stir in unsweetened cocoa powder for a chocolate twist.

Sweeteners can balance cold brew’s natural bitterness. Use these options:

* **Sugar:** Simple and classic, dissolve well in cold brew.
* **Honey:** Adds floral sweetness and smooth texture.
* **Agave Syrup:** A vegan-friendly sweetener with mild flavor.
* **Maple Syrup:** Gives a rich, earthy sweetness.
* **Simple Syrup:** Easy to mix, made by dissolving sugar in water.

Here is a quick guide for adding sweeteners:

|Sweetener|Recommended Amount|Flavor Impact|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Sugar|1-2 tsp per 8 oz|Sweet and neutral|
|Honey|1 tsp per 8 oz|Sweet, floral, smooth|
|Agave Syrup|1 tsp per 8 oz|Mild sweetness|
|Maple Syrup|1 tsp per 8 oz|Rich, earthy sweetness|
|Simple Syrup|1-2 tsp per 8 oz|Sweet, easy to mix|

Mix flavors and sweeteners slowly. Taste your cold brew as you go. Adjust to find the perfect balance. Serve over ice for a cool, refreshing coffee drink that suits your style.

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Making cold brew coffee at home is simple and rewarding. Yet, some common issues can affect your coffee’s taste and texture. Troubleshooting these problems helps you enjoy a smooth, rich cup every time. This section covers two frequent issues: weak or bitter brew and cloudiness with sediment. Follow these tips to improve your cold brew experience.

# Weak Or Bitter Brew

A weak or bitter cold brew often means the coffee-to-water ratio, grind size, or brewing time needs adjustment. **Cold brew should taste smooth and balanced**, not watery or harsh.

Here are common causes and fixes:

* **Weak Brew:** Use more coffee grounds or a finer grind.
* **Bitter Brew:** Use coarser grounds or shorten brewing time.
* **Incorrect Ratio:** Aim for about 1 cup of coffee grounds to 4 cups of water.
* **Brewing Time:** Steep between 12 to 24 hours. Longer brewing can cause bitterness.

Use this table to troubleshoot quickly:

|Issue|Cause|Solution|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Weak Brew|Too little coffee or grind too coarse|Increase coffee amount or use finer grind|
|Bitter Brew|Too long brewing or grind too fine|Reduce brewing time or use coarser grind|

Follow these tips to find your perfect balance. **Adjust one factor at a time** to see what changes the flavor best.

# Cloudiness And Sediment

Cloudy cold brew or sediment at the bottom can be unappealing but not harmful. These issues often come from the grind size or filtering method.

**Cloudiness** happens when tiny coffee particles stay suspended in the liquid. Sediment forms when grounds settle at the bottom.

Ways to reduce cloudiness and sediment:

* Use a coarser grind to avoid fine particles.
* Filter the brew twice using a fine mesh or paper filter.
* Pour cold brew slowly to leave sediment behind.
* Store the brew in the fridge for a few hours to let sediment settle before pouring.

Try these filtering options:

1. **Cheesecloth or nut milk bag:** Good for coarse filtering.
2. **Fine mesh strainer:** Catches medium-size particles.
3. **Paper coffee filter:** Best for removing fine sediment.

Using a combination often works best. For example, strain cold brew first with a mesh strainer, then with a paper filter.

**Clearer cold brew tastes cleaner and looks more inviting.** Taking time to filter well improves your coffee’s quality.

1o0xpxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o0xpxx/th_behind_the_sliding_door/,[TH] Behind the Sliding Door,"The lake looked hungover most mornings—flat, gray, pretending not to remember wind. I’d stand on the deck with my coffee and try to convince myself the water’s calm meant ours was possible. One month. That’s what we told June when we moved into her spare suite: thirty days, forty tops, until our place cleared inspection and we could stop living out of bins.

June joked about us squatting. “If my chairs go missing, I’m calling the news,” she said, laughing, not laughing. She had the kind of smile that pared a joke to the bone and left it on the counter, daring you to season it.

We’d been friends once—wine nights that turned into kitchen confessions, the sort of closeness that made me think agreeing to this arrangement was adult and generous rather than, as it turned out, naive. The house sat on a sloped lot, glass facing the lake like a staged apology. Our “suite” was a former rec room with a sliding door to the main living area. From the start, the door was temperamental; by the third week, temper had become policy.

Evan tried optimism like a sweater that never quite fit. “It’s temporary,” he said. He stacked our bins neatly in the corner, labeled everything in blocky handwriting. He changed the batteries in the smoke detector and, unasked, put felt pads under the chairs so they wouldn’t scrape. This is what he does: smooths edges, makes a case for patience.

June’s rules showed up one at a time. At first they were reasonable. No shoes on the rugs, wipe down the shower, don’t run the dryer after eleven because the lint trap screams. Then they were precise. Label your food, use only the left half of the fridge deli drawer, a tidy list taped above the thermostat in Sharpie: DO NOT PASS 70° (ELECTRIC BILL!). The list sprouted a cousin on the fridge—Household Safety Policy—with bullet points that sounded like a lawyer having a bad day. Tenants must announce entry to common areas. Tenants assume risk of injury. Landlord may restrict access to appliances in case of unsafe operation.

“Did you print this off a website?” I asked when I found it.
“Pinterest,” she said. “But it’s common sense.”

The Wi-Fi password changed first. “Oh shoot,” June said when I asked. “Forgot to text you. New security. Tyler—” She stopped herself. “Old habit. Evan. I’ll write it down.”

She never did. Evan shrugged and turned our phones into hotspots. “Two more weeks,” he said. “We can do almost anything for two more weeks.”

The TV upstairs developed a medical need for high volume. Even when she was outside, it blared softly into the bones of the house—commercial jingles you could hum through a pillow, a crime show that narrated itself right through drywall. On days she left the TV on while she ran errands, I muted it with a remote I kept hidden in a drawer. The next day I’d find the remote stuck to the underside of the coffee table with double-sided tape.

“I think she’s messing with us,” I told Evan.
“I think she’s particular,” he said. “Not malicious.”

He said the same thing about the sliding door the first night it locked. We came home late, and the glass wouldn’t budge. June appeared in the dark kitchen, an outline with a phone light trained on our shoes.

“Sorry,” she said, too brightly. “Just checking the latch. Old doors like to drift.” She was barefoot. The phone light drifted to my feet, then to Evan’s. “You’re back late.”
“Work ran long,” I said, though I didn’t owe her the detail and didn’t have it. “We’ll be quiet.”
“No worries,” she said. “The house carries sound.” She said it like a threat wrapped in a fun fact.

After that, the door began to stick more often. It clicked at odd hours. Once, when I was in the shower, it slid open a fraction and then, slowly, closed.
“We have to leave,” I told Evan, half-wet on the bathmat. “Sooner than the inspection.”
“We will,” he said. “We can’t force the bank to move faster. For now, lock from our side. Let me talk to her about the door.”

He did. For a few days it behaved. The TV grew quieter. The fridge list stayed the same. I almost managed to convince myself I’d been dramatic.

Then the little things began to go.

A spare key we kept in a cereal box. A bowl I used in the mornings. A bottle opener, not special, just ours. The key turned up on the windowsill with a note: Found this lol. The bowl reappeared in the upstairs cabinet labeled PASTA BOWLS in June’s slanted hand, as if our possessions had been adopted and given better names. The bottle opener I never saw again.

I started a journal. Times, dates, small facts. I wasn’t trying to build a case so much as I wanted to stop gaslighting myself. Door locked at 9:12 p.m. TV loud at 6:40 a.m. Bowl reappeared upstairs 3:15 p.m. Wi-Fi networks multiplied: LakeLife, LakeLifeGuest, LakeLifeKidsOnly, LakeLife!123 (5G). June says “innsurance” with two n’s.

“Don’t do that,” Evan said when he saw me writing. “You’ll make yourself crazy.”
“I’m trying not to be crazy,” I said.
He pulled me to him and kissed my temple. “Two weeks,” he said again, like weather, like fact.

June began to invite Evan upstairs when I wasn’t around. She needed help with a leaky faucet that didn’t leak when I checked it. She had questions about installing an outdoor camera. She wanted his opinion on paint colors. When I came up behind them one afternoon, she was showing him screenshots of neighborhood alerts: Suspicious activity near the lake. Person with flashlight at 2:13 a.m. The photos were blur and grain and reflection.

“We should be careful,” she said. She didn’t look at me. “I heard something the other night.”
“Footsteps?” I said.
“Could be,” she said, making a mouth like she was tasting a possibility. “Old houses carry sound.”

That night I woke to a sweep of light at the sliding door—slow, horizontal, like a search. Evan was asleep, his breathing even. I held my breath and watched the light pause, then tilt away, magician’s hand withdrawing. In the morning, I found faint arcs on the deck like scuff marks. June’s boots, lined by the slider, matched the curve.
“Who would she be protecting us from,” I asked Evan, “if she were the one outside with a light?”
“Maybe she heard something and checked,” he said, but he didn’t quite make eye contact.

I moved the journal from my nightstand to the back of a kitchen drawer. When I checked it three days later, the last entry was underlined in blue ink. I don’t own a blue pen.
I started leaving my phone recording on the counter when I went to shower. The first day, I caught a rustle and door squeak and a hum that could’ve been the fridge, the old house, or a person. The second day, nothing. The third, the file was gone.

On a Sunday, June posted a printed schedule on the fridge: Shared Kitchen Hours. Our names were assigned time blocks. Ours were early morning and late evening. Her blocks were everything else.
“Is this a joke?” I asked. My voice came out thinner than I intended.
She took a beat to pretend she hadn’t heard the fight in it. “Boundaries,” she said cheerfully. “It’s healthier.”
“For who?” I said.
“It’s my house,” she said, sweet as a burn. “So we’ll start there.”

Evan tried to split the difference. He put a small table in our suite and called it a kitchenette. He bought a plug-in hot plate. “A few more days,” he said. “It’ll be funny later.”
I wanted it to be funny. I wanted to look back and laugh about meal slots and password safari. But the house had started to feel like a personality test we were failing. The glass reflected us back as thin versions.

The storm came on a Thursday. The weather alert did the phone-banshee thing that makes you feel like the sky is a person calling your name. June stood on the deck watching the lake bruise. “We may lose power,” she announced, as if she’d written the forecast. “Candles are upstairs. I’ll be locking the sliding door to make sure wind doesn’t rattle it off the track.”
“It locks from both sides,” I said.
She smiled with all her teeth. “Exactly.”
The wind arrived fast, dinner plates slamming cabs, trees bending their knees. When the power went, the house exhaled, then felt suddenly very present—each wall a shoulder, each window an eye. The TV died mid-sentence upstairs; the silence left a shape as loud as any sound.
Evan found our flashlights. One was dead. The other worked if you pinched it like a reluctant bug. The sliding door took its chance and misbehaved. From our side, it wouldn’t slide. From upstairs, something tapped it twice, like knuckles. I said nothing.

The first crash came from the kitchen. A pan, maybe, or the complaint of a cutlery drawer yanked wide. Then June’s voice, high, the way people sound when they want to be both frightened and in charge of the fright. “Hello?” she called into the dark. “Is someone there?”

Evan put his hand on the doorjamb and listened hard. “Stay,” he said, meaning me. He lifted the latch; it didn’t budge. “June?” he called. “You okay?”

Footsteps. Then light—June’s flashlight beam steady as a plan, cutting through the door’s seam. “I saw someone at the window,” she said, a little breathless. “They ran.”
“Which window?” I asked.
“The one by your—” She stopped. “By the downstairs hallway.”
“There’s no window there,” I said.
The light bobbed. “I mean— I thought—” She laughed, a sharp thing. “Sorry. Storm brain.”

Evan went up the back stairs to check the locks. I stayed in our suite and used my phone’s weak flashlight to scan the floor, under the futon, the corners where a shadow could decide to be more. The room had become a different country. The bins looked like strangers, the labels too sure of themselves.

In the beam’s edge, something caught. A small square tucked into the L between couch and wall. I reached down and pulled it free. A phone. Not ours. Not new. Recording app open. Timestamp: 00:02:13.

My scalp prickled. I felt the urge to put it back exactly, pretend I had never touched what was touching me. Instead I opened the audio.

Silence at first. Then the scrape of the sliding door, a small laugh I knew and didn’t want to know, Evan’s name in June’s whisper like a coin slid across a bar. The recording stopped, started, stopped, as if the phone had been palmed and pocketed and set again.

Footsteps above me, then on the stairs, then outside our door. I put the phone under the couch cushion and stepped back.

The sliding door slid, slow as a breath through teeth. Evan’s silhouette, then June’s behind him like a shadow that didn’t belong to anything.

“Everything’s locked,” Evan said. He looked pale in the flashlight glow. “But the deck gate is open.”
“I told you,” June said. “Someone’s prowling.”
“Or you opened it,” I said. I had meant for it to sound calm, clean. The words came out raw.
Her face went still. “Why would I do that?”
“Maybe because you like controlling what everyone’s afraid of,” I said. “Maybe because you’re bored. Maybe because you’re sick.”

It was too much. It sounded crazy. I heard it. Evan flinched.
“You know what?” June said softly. “I was going to be nice. I was going to say, let’s revisit the timeline in the morning. But I’m done. You need to leave. Now.”
“In a storm?” Evan asked. “Be reasonable.”
Her laugh was a knife. “I’m being reasonable. You,” she told me without looking at me, “are unstable. You’ve been recording me. You’ve been moving things and blaming me. You’ve been—” She gestured at the air, harvesting words. “Escalating.”

I wanted to argue. I wanted to drag the phone from under the cushion and play it, make truth do its job. Instead I heard myself say, too quiet, “You’ve been in our room.”
Evan’s head snapped. June’s smile skittered. “Why would I want to be in here?” she said, making here sound like an illness.
“Because you want to watch,” I said. “Because you can’t stand that we live a life inside your house that isn’t about you.”

Lightning whitened the glass. For a second, all three of us were cutouts on a lightbox. Then the world went black again, small and human.
From upstairs, a bang. Front door? Cabinet? The house shook its shoulders.
Evan motioned toward the stairs. “I’ll check the front,” he said. “Don’t—” He didn’t finish. He looked at me like I was a problem with two true answers.

He went. June stayed, her flashlight low, painting the floor. “You should pack,” she said. “I won’t have this in my home.”
“I’ll pack,” I said. “And I’ll leave you a note.” I made a smile that felt borrowed. “A friendly one.”

Her light stuttered across the couch cushion. I willed it to move on. It did. “I’m calling the police,” she said. “A prowler is one thing. A tenant who threatens me is another.”
“Who threatened you?”
“You did,” she said, too evenly. “Just now. You said you’d leave a note.” She blinked. “I don’t know what you mean when you say friendly.”
I laughed. I couldn’t help it. “Of course you don’t.”

Upstairs, Evan called for me. “Front door’s fine. But—” He stopped. “There’s water by the back window.”
I took my chance. “Go help him,” I said to June. “I’ll start packing.”

She looked at me too long, calculating new math. Then she went, a soft sweep of socks on stairs.

I pulled the phone from under the cushion and slipped it in my pocket. My hands shook. In the dim, I rolled one bin forward and stacked two others on top. Pack what you can, I thought. Documents, chargers, the few clothes that still felt like mine.

I found our spare car key in the cereal box where it had reappeared. I found a note on the inside flap of our bin labeled WINTER: This is not your house. I left it there.

The storm got bored of rage and settled into purpose. The house breathed with it. I could hear June’s voice upstairs, fast and controlled, the register people use when they’re speaking for a recording. For a second I wondered if she’d put a phone somewhere to catch us again. For a second I wondered if she’d been catching us all along.

When the police lights finally lit the curve of the driveway, they turned the lake into an emergency. June’s relief was theatrical. “Officer,” she called in a tone minted for sympathy, “thank goodness. There’s been someone trying to get in. And my tenants are—” She looked directly at me through the sliding door glass. “Frightened.”

Evan stood half a step behind her, the expression of a man learning to count in a new language. The officer took statements the way people take coats—politely, without promise. June’s was crisp. Evan’s was careful. Mine was brief. I didn’t mention the phone.
“Storms do weird things to houses,” the officer said finally, eyes on June’s boots by the slider, the wet arcs outside. “Locks swell, doors stick, branches knock.” He looked at us like he wanted to be anywhere else. “You all be careful.”

After they left, June found her composure and a hair tie. “Morning,” she said, as if the night had been a temp.
“What did you tell them?” I asked.
“The truth,” she said. “That there were noises. That you’re leaving.”
Evan blinked. “We didn’t agree to that.”
“Yes, you did,” she said sweetly. “Just now.”

He looked at me. I looked at him. We didn’t say what we were both thinking: that sometimes the reasonable thing is leaving before reason gets carved down to a rule on the fridge.
We packed. Not everything. The bins that mattered. The rest of our life could catch up or grow mold. Evan carried the heavier ones, moving like a person inventing a different future with each lift. I took pictures of the rooms as if I were making a record for a judge who would never read it. June stood on the deck and watched, her arms folded, the lake polishing its face behind her.

At the door, I put a note on the counter out of spite and habit both. June—thank you for the time here. We’re moving out today. Text to coordinate returning keys. I underlined coordinate twice and felt better than I should have.
When we left, she didn’t wave. The storm had rinsed the air so clean it made my teeth ache. Evan’s truck felt like an answer.

We drove to a motel with a number in the name and a smell of other people’s plans. Evan fell asleep hard, his jaw unclenching in stages. I sat at the end of the bed with the other phone in my hand and thought about evidence, about truth, about how a recording fixes nothing if the person hearing it has already decided. I pressed play anyway. I listened to June whisper Evan’s name. I listened to my own voice in the background on some earlier day, laughing at something that wasn’t funny.

When the recording ended, I scrolled. There were more files. Days and days of our life, sliced. June humming. Evan talking to himself in the kitchen. Me on the deck saying we can do anything for two weeks like a dare.

I didn’t wake him. I went into the bathroom and locked the door and stared at the motel mirror until my face resolved. I opened my notes app and wrote one line: Do not forgive a house for teaching you to be small.

In the morning, June texted. Please leave keys under mat. Also, you left a bowl. I’ll donate.
Evan looked at the screen over my shoulder. “Block her,” he said, and though it was small and late, the words warmed me.

We dropped the keys. I put the phone I’d taken in a padded mailer and addressed it to myself care of our new place—still imaginary, but less imaginary than before. I didn’t want to carry her voice any farther than I had to. On the way to the post office, we drove past the lake road. The house sat with its glass face glazed, the deck chairs stacked like a threat, the sliding door catching light.

“That door,” Evan said, and we both laughed in the way that means not yet.

Our closing was delayed another week, then another. We lived in that motel until the lady at the desk started greeting us by name and sliding me extra coffee pods. Nights, I woke to the hum of the air conditioner half convinced it was the TV upstairs, and had to talk myself back into the room with the paintings of sailboats and the safe that didn’t work. Days, we filled forms and looked at paint chips for walls we did not yet own. We made something like a plan.

The day we finally got the keys to our own quiet, ordinary house, the air smelled like cut grass and dried rain. The rooms were smaller than I’d imagined and kinder. There was a sliding door to the porch—of course there was—and I touched the handle like a test. It moved easily, no sticks, no clicks. I locked it from our side and watched the mechanism seat with a firm little yes.

That night, I dreamed of the lake. In the dream, June stood on the deck with her phone held up not as a light but as a mirror, trying to catch our reflection and make it belong to her. When I woke, our new house was dark and honest. Evan’s breathing was the right kind of sound. I stood, padded barefoot to the sliding door, and put my palm flat against the glass. The lock was set. The door rattled, faintly, because houses breathe.

I waited for the old panic to climb my spine. It didn’t. The room held.

On the second morning, a text from an unknown number: Did you mean to send me this? A photo followed—my note on June’s counter, the lake behind it, a pale smudge of someone’s reflection in the glass. The number wasn’t June’s. It wasn’t anyone I knew. The timestamp said 2:13 a.m.
I stared at it long enough for the coffee to go cold. Then I slid the text thread into the trash and set my phone face down on the table. Outside, our fence needed painting. The grass needed a haircut. The day needed me to choose it on purpose.

Later, I went to the porch and checked the sliding door again. Locked, from the inside. The glass showed me my face, not anyone else’s. Still, when the wind pushed, the frame shivered—just a little—and the door gave a tiny, habitual rattle, like an old house clearing its throat to speak.
I left it to talk to itself. I had walls to paint. A bed to build. A life with fewer lists.

That night, after Evan fell asleep, I took my journal—the motel version, slim and patient—and wrote until the words stopped feeling like evidence and turned into air. At the bottom of the page I drew a neat box and inside it wrote:
— If a door locks from both sides, choose the one that keeps you home.

I closed the book. I turned off the light. Somewhere in the dark of the house, wood settled, glass murmured, and a hundred yesterday sounds knocked softly and receded, as if trying one last time to be let back in.

Okay, this is gonna sound insane, but — does anyone else remember that weird adult bar called Chuck-E-Coffee that used to be next to some Chuck E. Cheese’s?

Like, it was the same logo but brown instead of red, and it was for parents to “unwind while the kids played.” My mom used to joke it was “where the mouse goes after dark.”

I swear it was real. There was one off a highway somewhere — big neon mug sign with Chuck E. wearing sunglasses and holding a latte instead of pizza. 

But I just spent an hour trying to find proof of it online.
Nothing. 
Even Chuck E. Cheese employees on Reddit say it “never existed.”

I used to own a Niche Zero, and brewed mostly medium to medium-dark roasts. Since I purchased my Timemore 078s, and later my 064s, I've gravitated to lighter roasts, and sold the Niche. Until now, I've never brewed anything darker than medium roast with my Timemore grinders. Just for fun, I wanted to see how they performed with dark roasted beans, and how my taste buds would react to a very dark roast's flavor profile.

I've lived in San Francisco for 25 years but only heard of [Graffeo](https://graffeo.com/) recently. For those who don't know Graffeo, the company was founded in 1935, making it one of the oldest boutique coffee roasters in the US. They pioneered the use of fluid bed roasting, where the beans are roasted on a ""bed"" of blown hot air, and never touch metal.

They only sell a single blend of 100% Arabica beans from Colombia, New Guinea and Costa Rica. Beans are sold either as a dark roast, what they call light (actually medium) roast, and decaf. Their dark roast has a great reputation for making traditional, Italian-style espresso, so I decided it was time to try it.

The Graffeo is the least dense coffee I've ever brewed. An 18g dose requires a 20g basket to fit properly. The beans have an oily sheen, but fortunately aren't sticky. I was worried they would gunk up my Timemore grinders, but so far that hasn't been a problem.

For me, these beans produce an excellent example of a traditional, full bodied, dark roast espresso, tasking like bittersweet chocolate. I prefer them brewed as a ristretto, 18g in to 24g out in 30 seconds including pre-infusion. The beans are very forgiving of grind size, making them very easy to dial in. While I was trying to figure out the best grind dial setting on both of my grinders, I pulled everything from a turbo shot to a 75 second extraction, and all shots tasted great.

My extractions with a bottomless don't look like those super-viscous streams that you see on TikTok, but the shots made from both of my Timemore grinders have ample body and taste great. Unfortunately I no longer have my Niche Zero to compare with. Although a flat burr grinder like the Niche might produce more body then I am getting with my Timemore grinders, I am very happy with Timemore's performance on a dark roast.

While this has been a fun and educational journey, I will be going back to lighter roasts after I finish this bag of beans. However, if you are a fan of darker roasts, Graffeo definitely belongs on your list of beans to try. And if you are a dark roast fan that is considering buying a Timemore Sculptor grinder, then go for it!",24,1759887683.0,espresso,16,0.88,False

1o0xn2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1o0xn2t/colonoscopy_diary_31f_suprep/,Colonoscopy diary - 31F - Suprep,"I scheduled a colonoscopy due to some intermittent bleeding I was relatively certain was coming from a hemorrhoid - however, my maternal grandpa died from colon cancer so I wanted to be extra cautious. 

My instructions said to switch to low fiber 3 days before the procedure. I am mostly plant based (but eat eggs; no meat or dairy) so was a little tricky. For the first day I wasn't as careful - I had my usual - 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast, half an avocado and some cubes of melon. For lunch I had a thai non dairy curry with tofu and white rice, and for dinner went out to eat and had pasta with sauce as well as some dosa (thin lentil crepe so no whole pieces) and a tomato salad. On the second day, I had the same breakfast. For lunch I had a curry with beyond meat (pretty low fiber content) and white rice. Dinner was white pasta and marinara sauce (no veg chunks in the sauce) at 7pm. 

The day of liquid diet was really difficult because I have a fast metabolism and quickly get lightheaded if I don't eat - was super proud of myself for making it through. I had organic coconut water, black coffee, and clear vegetable ginger broth from juice press to make it through the day. 

I took my first dose of suprep at 6pm, took me about 30 mins to drink - chased with white gatorade. I luckily didn't throw up at all though it was disgusting. Had no stomach cramping or pains at all. Bowel movements started by 7pm and lasted around 2.5 hours. I was nervous based on others' stories that it would last all night, but I had 6-7 movements and they mostly started off as liquid. Each was pretty short in duration as well. I was able to go to bed at 10pm, had to wake up at 2 to use the bathroom and then fell back asleep. Woke up at 4:30am for my next dose - procedure time was 10am but I knew it would take 30 mins or so to drink and also was really nervous about having an accident in the uber en route... luckily that didn't happen!

I had about 6 more movements from 4:30am-8am. I was nervous because at the end of the prep, I didn't achieve a ""bright yellow"" color. It was more dark yellow like dehydrated urine and a little cloudy - no flecks though. Started to get paranoid about what I had eaten and whether it hadn't been low fiber enough. 

Made it through an uber ride 8:45-9:35am and had no urge for additional bowel movements upon using the bathroom at the surgical center. I mentioned to the doctor what the color of most recent movements has been and she said it was probably fine. I ended up receiving a perfect score of a 9 and had super clear photos, and no polyps - just internal hemorrhoids as expected. Haven't had any extra gas really since the procedure, stomach has felt normal for the rest of the day.

I know meat is low fiber and often recommended as part of the colonoscopy diet, but I would highly recommend eating vegetarian during your prep. Less so for colon cleanness but I think it did make my prep easier - since meats digest more slowly (up to 72 hours for the whole process as compared to carbs which are often out in <24 hours) they sit in your large intestine longer and it's more for your body to expel. I was grateful that I had enough of a break to sleep and from other stories I've read on here, it sounds like I was able to get cleaned out more quickly than average.

I’m fully convinced this is now an addiction more than just a habit. I know it’s quite literally as easy as: stop doing it. But it’s still nearly impossible. I’ve tried replacing the habit with something at home and it works for maybe 2 days before it comes back ten fold (going to the coffee shop twice a day). For reference: I get a coffee everyday, sometimes twice a day. Each coffee costing $6. That’s roughly $2k a year in coffee shops. And I know it’s bad, but does that stop me? Nope. I desperately need help with this and don’t know who to reach out to. I’ve talked to my therapist, close friends, family, and they all look at me like I’m crazy. My therapist thinks it’s due to needing that consistency/stability in my life (I got a lot of trauma).

1o0xiyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1o0xiyz/how_checking_my_phone_before_getting_out_of_bed/,how checking my phone before getting out of bed destroyed my productivity for 2 years,"I used to reach for my phone before my eyes were even fully open. just laying there scrolling through instagram, twitter, youtube for like 45 minutes. seemed harmless, maybe even necessary to ""wake up properly."" completely wrong.

every single day started with me feeling anxious, overwhelmed, and already behind before i even stood up. my brain was fried before breakfast.

the breaking point came when i realized i couldn't remember the last time i woke up feeling good. like genuinely energized and ready for the day. it had been months, maybe years. i was starting every morning by flooding my brain with other people's problems, news, drama, and comparison.

decided to try something extreme. put my phone charger in the bathroom instead of next to my bed. couldn't check it until after i brushed my teeth and washed my face. that's it. no willpower test every morning, just physically harder to grab.

first day was brutal. hand automatically reached for the nightstand. nothing there. felt weird. anxious even. but i got up, did my bathroom routine, and by then the urge had passed.

managed 4 days. then a week. then it just became normal. now it's been 8 months.

what change the most was i started doing things in the morning. like actual things. made coffee slowly instead of rushing. read physical books. went for walks. had real conversations with my partner instead of both of us staring at screens.

when i don't start my day with my phone, i barely want it during the day either. it's like that first scroll session was programming my brain to crave it all day long. break that cycle and suddenly i'm not constantly reaching for it.

my screen time went from 7-8 hours daily to around 2-3 hours. and most of that now is actually useful stuff like maps, music, or texting people i care about. not mindless consumption.

the morning sets the template. if you start reactive and distracted, you stay reactive and distracted. if you start intentional and present, the rest follows.

if you're stuck in the morning scroll trap, just try moving your charger across the room for 3 days. that's it. don't try to quit your phone entirely or become some productivity robot. just make it slightly harder to grab first thing.

Hello everyone, 

My best friend had 2 children with his gf in a house here in West Michigan that he owns.  One day he comes home and his ex left a note said she was having and affair with a guy in California for some time now and she went to go live with him in her mom's basement in California and she took his car. She hasn't let him have the kids in 3 years. He only sees them on FaceTime after she demands money. But she doesn't only ask for the kids, (he sends $400 from every bi-weekly check on PayPal) she will ask for money for her gas, coffee, hair, and nails and if he doesn't pay she blocks him and won't let him talk to the kids for an unknown amount of time. (Any time from a day to 2 months.) When she unblocks hims she asks if he learned his lesson. She guilts him by saying they don't have any money and the kids hate him and if he asks to come see them in California she said she would call ICE and have him deported. 

Unfortunately, my friend is ""illegal"" as his parents brought him over from Mexico when he was 2 months old. He doesn't speak Spanish nor know any family in Mexico. He had DACA but it expired after graduation. He was going to join the military to get naturlized but Trump ended that program this year. He's working on getting a green card but everything is extra complicated right now.

Now apparently she wants a new car and she said if he doesn't pay for it (she wants a 4k down payment and monthly car payments) she's gonna sue him for back child support and if that doesn't work out she'll have ICE come get him. 

He was a really good dad and he was wrecked for over a year and he just wants to see the kids. He banks on the ICE threats as being empty because if he was in Mexico they would have no money. 

This seems like out right parental alienation to me. But does he have any recourse not being a Citizen of the United States? Can he get custody? He would actually love to pay a set amount for child support if it meant the kids could be with him.

He works two jobs to be able to send her money and pay his mortgage/utilities 40hours($22 an hour)/ 20hours($15 an hour). She works 40hours ($31 an hour). Grandma is ""daycare"", she doesn't pay rent.",0,1759886877.0,legaladvice,3,0.5,False

1o0xdb7,https://i.redd.it/nqwhjxxtistf1.jpeg,A memory of JFK Jr. offers respite from today’s stress-filled politics.,"Written by Douglas Mackinnon in 2022 for ‘The Hill’.

Every mind needs to decompress, from time to time, from the daily stresses of life. To say those stresses, of late, have been on steroids would be an understatement. That decompression time for me came this week when I stumbled upon a YouTube clip of John F. Kennedy Jr.’s appearance on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” on May 14, 1998.

I don’t pretend that I knew JFK Jr. well. I did not. When I was director of communications for former Sen. Bob Dole, I exchanged a few phone calls with him and then met with him in person for a couple of hours when he invited Dole to his George magazine offices for an off-the-record coffee with him and his staff.

While watching the clip of Leno interviewing John, the memories of my interaction with him came flooding back. I remember JFK Jr. as the personification of class, civility and kindness.
When Dole and I arrived at the magazine’s 41st floor offices that morning in May 1999 — just two months before John’s death — we were a bit early and most of the lights in the office had not been turned on. To our surprise (but surely not the surprise of anyone who truly knew him) John was there to greet us himself in the darkened hallway. As he stepped toward us, he did something very kind and special, which few people ever did when meeting Dole: He extended his left hand to shake Dole’s hand.
John knew the senator lost the use of his right arm and hand in combat during World War II, and he didn’t miss a beat as he considerately and compassionately shook Dole’s hand. It was a simple gesture of awareness and kindness, which Dole told me later meant a great deal to him.

After bringing us to his office, John personally got each of us a cup of coffee. We talked for a few minutes about current events and then the protocol for the off-the-record conversation about to take place in a large conference room down the hall with his staff. Before we left his office, he pointed with pride to a framed piece of true American history: the signatures of every president from George Washington to — at that time — Bill Clinton. John explained with a smile that it was one of his most treasured possessions because it was a gift from his beloved mother, Jacqueline Kennedy.

In the conference room, like any good staffer, I made a bee line for a chair against the wall. Just as I took out my notebook, John walked over and insisted that I sit at the table between him and the senator. I declined, but he politely refused to take “no” for an answer. As I sat down in the seat he had designated, my right shirt cuff moved up a bit to reveal the old, beat-up runner’s watch — with a plastic wristband — that I had worn that day because the battery on my “good” watch went bad. I had been advised in the strongest possible terms not to wear this crusty watch in the presence of the “most elegant man in the world.” I quickly pulled down my cuff to cover the watch.  During the next 45 minutes or so, John would lean over to me to whisper thoughts or comments on questions his staff was asking Dole. Then, I suddenly was aware of his stare. I looked over to see him looking directly at my wrist. “Nice watch,” he said with a laugh, after catching my eye.

With the YouTube clip of the Leno show, which elicited these memories, I found more than 7,000 comments by viewers. Almost every person commented on the intelligence, charm, civility, confidence, kindness and humor of John F. Kennedy Jr. Such enduring respect and admiration reminded me of his massive potential taken from us too soon.

Would JFK Jr. have run for public office? We will never know, but I will always be convinced the nation — and the world — would have been in a better place if he had the chance to continue to exert his influence. At the end of the clip, Leno reflects a year later on John’s passing, teary-eyed: “There are people you just want to see grow old. … He was a very, very nice man.” More than nice, JFK Jr. embodied all that could still be great about politics. I advise anyone feeling down about our current times to watch the clip, take a deep breath and remember that, surely, there still are a few people left in politics who believe in doing the right things with intelligence, compassion, empathy, civility and humor.",9,1759886739.0,JohnAndCarolyn,0,0.84,False

So I want to preface by saying that I absolutely know I am the problem and that I am responsible for the situation I am in. I started working at 16 at a diner. I stayed there for like 8 months, but I had quit because we had a roach infestation and my boss did not care. So that one I can say was justified. But ever since then, o have job hopped like crazy. I had life happen, and I dropped out of college while I was in a highly abusive relationship. Out of that relationship now, am happily married for 2 years, and have twins. I just quit my job at a popular coffee chain (I lasted over a year, worked up until my water broke and went back earlier since my leave was unpaid. I quit due to a high volume of policy changes, increase of workload) in the hopes of working at a local brewery, but I just… didn’t like it. My boss was very rude and weird to me, so I quit after 1 day there (I also was making no money… that’s how I justified that. I’d rather take care of my  kids than stand around and do nothing). But before I moved and was married I’ve probably had over 50 jobs. From 16-26… that’s so bad. I’ve maybe had more my god. Some I lasted a week or two; some like the last I had quit after one day. I worked 2 seasons at a country club, but was sexually harassed by my clubhouse manager. I was too scared to speak up so I ghosted them… I went back to stripping for awhile, that made my mental state worse but I was making money. But yeah I’ve bopped around from retail to restaurant to dancing. I just can’t justify staying. I get bored. I think everything is stupid and I have a hard time caring about anything really. I don’t know what to do or how to fix myself because I know this is not normal. I hate corporate and corporations so much and I hate how they treat workers (I’ve worked for Amazon, Whole Foods, chain restaurants both fast casual like chipotle and sit down, mom and pop, boutiques, warehouse, you name it if it doesn’t need a certification or degree I’ve done it). I worked at a local small grocery store for over a year, I loved that job but there was a pay dispute when I found out my coworker who did my exact job was making 3 dollars more than me… I just want to feel some fulfillment. Or at least hold a job for longer than a year and not hate my life. I am thinking of perusing medical coding, but I need a job in the meantime to pay for it. I feel so stuck and lost and left behind compared to everyone else my age. Yeah I beat addiction, I left the abuse, I have a beautiful family… but I dropped out of school and became basically a lowly retail and restaurant hopper. How do I fix this mindset?

1o0xau5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0xau5,1 year pull free after 14 years (my story and TIPS),"
Okay so let me start this off by saying that what worked for me may not work for you and that is OKAY! Seriously even as a clinical psychologist I did not easily “cure” myself. I should also say I had the compulsive split end type and didn’t open pull hair that wasn’t split directly from my head but there were times…

If someone told me even two/three years ago that I would surmount trichotillomania, I would not believe them. Not because I didn’t want to but because it can’t imagine that after doing this horrible “habit” for 13+ years that I would stop. 

Man the amount of shame I had. I took the before pictures on college over 10 years ago when I was really stressed and I felt so ashamed of how my hair looked I took the picture and told myself that I would look back on it WHEN i stopped to remind myself of how far I’ve come but the day is now 🥹 

I’m so proud of myself and also proud of all of you as I know how difficult it is existing when you feel like you have this horrible secret that brings you so much shame. 

But here is some tips. If can do it so can you!!!

1. DO NOT GIVE UP | even if you give up for a day or an hour do not let that be your forever. Even if you do not feel it emotionally repeat that to yourself logically and it will manifest. You have to believe it because you really are a fighter. 
2. TALK ABOUT IT| Trich felt like this scary monster that brought me so much shame. I put in my closet and never looked at. It was making it worse and making me pull more I think. I had to work hard to combat an idea that I was doing something “bad” or “disgusting” and more so something to help myself regulate my feelings or unmet needs/desires
3. PSYCHOTHERAPY | almost always with trich involves trauma and I think finding a good fit therapist (even if it means paying extra if you can afford it) goes a long way. Especially one that is even slightly familiar with trichotillomania. Mine even gave me a book reccomendarion on it. 
4. SELF COMPASSION | I think compassion is an antidote to shame and that you owe it to your beautiful soul to be kind to you. I say or write down three things about myself that I appreciated each day. As well as three things I appreciated about others/a situation. 
5. LOWER YOUR ANXIETY | As much as possible remove stressors that make your nervous system more dysregulated because I truly see trich and other BFRBs as a means of self regulation/self soothing. This can mean switching jobs, careers, relationships. I also changed from coffee to tea and that has helped a lot. 
6. DEVOTE YOURSELF TO YOUR HAIR | in my times with bald spots I would force myself to read more about hair and get into hair oiling and hair care because I had clear visions of what I wanted it to look like. Instead of obsessing over the “bad” hairs I focused on cultivating the “good” ones and this helped keep my hope 
7. (FOR MY SPLIT ENDERS) so instead of compulsively pulling or destroying my split ends I would cut them off with a scissors. To the point that I would carry hair shears around a lot and divert my attention to trimming the “bad”/damaged hair (making space for the good ones) and knowing that my hair will be healthy. It is still kinda neurotic hahah but a more healthy way of doing it? I still do this now but it’s also cause I have a decade of damaged hair 
8. TIE YOUR HAIR UP | I would pull/split during studying which was very dysregulating me. I would buy satin hair bonnets and always wore them when I was studying cause I know my hands went to my head during stress. Obviously you can’t tie your hair up or cover it all the time but so it in situations that you pull more do it 
9. PSYCHOEDUCATION | read more about it not just from others who have it but psychological perspectives too. When I learned more about why I was doing this thing I felt I had no control off it helped me regain control 
10. KNOW THAT YOU WILL HAVE SETBACKS | I tried to stop since having it at 16 (I’m almost 30 now) but only got more serious about it the last few years.  Seriously do not give up and what works for you may not work for others and vice versa 

Anyway I’m forgetting some but this is my journey and I hope it can be of help to some of you!

1o0xaf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1o0xaf9/jeremys_inferno_part_1/,Jeremy's Inferno Part 1,"Out of all the cults Jeremy had the displeasure of dealing with, the cult of Dantalion was by far and away his least favorite. They weren’t the most dangerous (that honor would have to go the cult of Paimon), nor were they particularly good at, well, anything. While he could find some words of genuine praise for the other goetic cults such those of Baal, Astaroth, and Barbatos, the cult of Dantalion was quite literally the most inept group of grown men he’d ever seen, which, in this day and age, was quite impressive in its own right.

They were ridiculously incompetent, to the point where he had to wonder if their behavior was an elaborate ruse to make him drop his guard. They walked in the open in their black robes fingerprinted with the seal of Dantalion, and openly referred to each other by childish nicknames like Brother Bloodwing, which was especially concerning as he hadn’t seen a member younger than the age of 25. They were annoyingly persistent, too, like a swarm of flies, only bigger and more stabby. Not that knives were much of a threat. 

Even now, one of them stood conspicuously on the other side of the street. Based on his rather stocky build, it was probably Brother Midnight Darkness (or MD as he preferred to be called). 

After having enough of pretending that he didn’t notice, Jeremy angrily sipped his latte, and glared through the cafe window toward the bush that MD was crouched behind. It immediately erupted in flames, causing the cultist to tumble backwards in surprise. Jeremy took another sip, this time with a slight smile on his face. He though about setting MD’s cloak on fire, but he doubted he had the common sense to stop-drop-and-roll. 

“Mama, fire!” A little boy in the front of the cafe tugged frantically at his mother’s shirt. As a future firefighter it was of the utmost importance that his mother know of the danger, but she continued to order her coffee. 

Jeremy’s eyebrow twitched. The fire would burn itself out in a few minutes, and while the kid didn’t know that, something about his voice just irked him. Each syllable was like nails on a chalkboard. Could the mother not hear him, or was she just tuning him out? Shouldn’t she be paying attention instead of giving the longest coffee order known to man?

“Mama, fire! Fire, fire. Fire, Mama. There’s a fire. Mama. Mama. There’s a fire, Mama. Mama…”

Suddenly, the container in front of Jeremy launched into the air and shattered on the table, spreading shards of glass and sugar all of him and the rest of the cafe. 

*Shit.*

The room was dead silent as every head snapped in his direction. His face turned beet red as he tried to think of a way out of the situation. He turned to the small fire that still smoldered across the street. It roared back to life with a small explosion that rattled the building, making Jeremy flinch. It was a bit bigger than he had meant to make it. 

“Oh my god!” Jeremy said as convincingly as he could, “there’s a fire!” 

While everyone else was moving closer to the window for a better look or scrambling for their phones, Jeremy quietly got up and threw his cup in the trash before slipping out of the front door. He turned briefly to see if the kid was okay. He was smiling ear to ear, mesmerized by the flames. He could’t shake the feeling that this would leave a lasting impression. 

*At least he’s quiet now*

He walked lazily past the parking lot, trying to keep his envious thoughts at bay. His own car, a beater that had held on for 5 years had given out him. His mechanic had told him that there was nothing that could be done. He was still mourning the loss with every trip he had to take on foot. This time it was hardly even worth it. He looked up a the sky and frowned. It was overcast. If it rained before he got home he was going to lose it. 

He calmed himself. Envy, anger, sloth: those were feelings he shouldn’t have. Those are the kinds of feelings that cause containers to explode or fires to be bigger than they are supposed to, made him more like his father. Containing those emotions would be so much easier if he didn’t keep having to dealing with nonsense, but it seemed that was all life had in store recently.

The walk home wasn’t too bad, though a light drizzle had started right as he was getting to his apartment complex. He walked up his stairs to his apartment and stopped. His door was ajar and the distinct smell of blood hung in the air. He steeled himself for what he was about to see. He already had a good idea. With a deep breath he swung open the door. 

His roommate was dead on the floor, his remote still clutched in his hand. No doubt a message from the cult of Dantalion. Blood was splattered all over the apartment, on the ceiling, the couch, the walls, the floors.

“GODDAMNIT” Jeremy yelled, “ I JUST MOPPED!”

“You’re the same as ever, Jeremy” a cold voice cut through the room. 

Jeremy turned his head toward the voice, and was met with a figure he knew all too well. He was tall and lankly, and wore a cheap black suit that looked a size too big. Like someone who’s family member had unexpectedly died and they had to throw something together on the spot. 

Jeremy forced a smile. “Azrael, long time no see.”

“It’s never long between our meetings.” The Angel of Death revealed his black wings, causing Jeremy to step back. “You know that.”

Jeremy gave a nervous laugh “ And here I thought I was doing a good job.”

“This,” Azrael said as he gestured toward the roommate, “is the only thing you’re good at.”

“Wow, way harsh —“

“Do not hide behind humor, Beast! How many people are you willing to let die to justify your own existence?”

Jeremy threw up his hands. “I didn’t do anything. This wasn’t even me. If you want to get mad at someone get mad at Dantalion.”

“As long as you live, cannot escape your destiny.” Azrael held out his hand to Jeremy. “If you take my hand you can overcome it.”

“You know what,” Jeremy said, “ I have had enough of this conversation.”

He took out a pocket knife and cut a slit into the palm of his hand, letting the blood fall on his roommate. He put his hands together as if praying.

“Ave Satanis!” He said before turning to Azrael “There, he’s alive. You can go now.”

“We’ll meet again, soon I’m sure.”

Jeremy turned back to his roommate and kneeled down over him.

“Hey, Brian” he said as he gently shook his roomate, “wake up, buddy.”

“J-jer? What happened.”

“Looks like you had a hell of a party while I was out.”

“I-is that blood?” Brian asked, becoming more coherent.

Looking for advice.,"I 29F have been with my boyfriend 37M for exactly 2 1/2 years. I want to preface this by saying nobody is perfect, but I am growing tired on the recurrence of his actions.

1) About 4 months into us dating, around July 2023, he was drunk and started messaging a girl on Instagram. Their conversation lasted a few days with him saying “you’re too pretty …. You’re too fine …. Send more pictures …. I’m tipsy and I need to see the pictures with the boobs.” Their conversation ended with his last two messages saying “Damn you so fine. What are you looking for?” I found out December of 2023 when I was looking at his phone and we broke up for a couple weeks then got back together after promises that he would never do it again.

2) Exactly one year into us dating, between March 2024 to end of April 2024 he downloaded 5 + dating apps (Bumble, Coffee Meets Bagel, OkCupid, Hinge, Tinder). He had multiple paid subscriptions and in app purchases. I found out about it April 2024 when he was showing me photos on his phone and he had a screenshot of a girls profile. We broke up for 2 months and then got back together after he started going to therapy.


3) Things were going well, until in August 2025 he was traveling to Florida for work. He looked up escorts, bumble, and hinge sites. He says in Florida he cannot look up porn sites without uploading his ID, which he didn’t want to do. I was fine with it, I don’t, really care about him looking at those sites as long as he is not actively seeking out individuals. But today I was on his Watsapp (with him knowing and handing me his phone). I saw a message to an unknown number and found out he had messaged an escort on Watsapp “Free tonight?” She never responded.

In all the 3 instances he has said he loves me, he is going to change, and he is going to talk to his therapist about things. He also blames it on his medication (anti-anxiety) and testosterone he recently started taking. I just want to hear opinions from others. I don’t want to end up 20 years with multiple kids and him cheating on me.

Around my early 20s my best friend and I fell out. We were super close but I was going through it, neither of us really reached out. A lot of people tell me this is normal, especially at that age. I didn’t go away for school so I already struggled making anything past an acquaintance in college. So suddenly my best friend and I stop hanging out, I’m bitter so I just remove her from social media. She does so back. Sadly no one communicated, and my other friends either moved or it became clear to me they saw me as a backup. I tried really hard to reach out to people even when I was going through a rough time. But a lot felt unreciprocated. I had another close friend just stop replying? One that met up with me but acted annoyed, etc. 

So I locked myself away and say well who’d wanna hang out with me anyway? I took it as a personal failure. What once was me going out of my house daily even for a coffee or just to walk, to 
 long plans, became me solo. I do stuff alone. But I have a comfort zone. It’s not the same, and I’ve tried making friends but it’s hard, especially because my interests or what I do are just different. I feel like many friends outgrew me, they became the party types where I still live with family so I can’t do that stuff.

Start with clarity, state your intent, tone, and audience directly. Then, give examples or constraints. For instance: *“Write a playful Instagram caption for a coffee brand promoting a Monday morning discount.”* That’s far more effective than *“Write a caption.”*

* Specific prompts yield more accurate, creative, and on-brand responses.

Been feeling a lot of grief over the past year as my social circle has become quite small and it touches on a lot of old wounds and insecurities.

Long story short, met a great group of friends a few years ago and finally felt like I fit in somewhere (I am a queer person and so is everyone in this friend group). I've always struggled to make / keep friends and have a hard time ""connecting"" with people. I've struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life (economically privileged but chaotic upbringing with very mentally ill & narcissistic parent) and was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid. Never been diagnosed as on the spectrum but ""definitely neurodivergent"" as a family member so kindly emphasized recently. I'm also an alcoholic in recovery, so dare I say I'm the whole package?

Anyways fast forward to last summer, I was living with one friend in the friend group and dating another. My friend / roommate and I had a falling out and a few months after that the person I was dating broke up with me and I was heartbroken. I certainly made mistakes in these relationships, as I was having a hard time with my emotional health and really wasn't managing well. Since then I have slowly been iced out by that entire friend group. I thought things were getting better as I was invited to a few things at the very beginning of this summer, but never heard from anyone again. I've reached out, and have since mended things with my old roommate and had a nice coffee with my now ex, but haven't heard back from other friends. It is so awkward, and also so devastating. I really loved spending time with these people, and now I feel delusional for thinking we were ever friends. I'm not without blame or accountability for my actions as I know I inadvertently caused harm, and the shame has made me want to die at times. I just feel like I must be huge piece of shit for an entire group of people decide not to want to be friends with me anymore.

How do I learn, grow, and move on from this?

1o0x1un,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o0x1un/aitah_for_not_forgiving_my_mother_or_brother_for/,AITAH For Not Forgiving My Mother Or Brother For Years?,"So I (24f) was diagnosed for having depression and anxiety for 6 years when I was 20 which was mainly caused by my brother (who is 2 years older than me) and my mother. 

I am the youngest of 3 kids (1 boy and 2 girls) and grew up with a mother who always put everything my brother did to me under the rug and acted like it never happened or that it was my fault. When I was younger my brother would threaten me with a machete and destroyed my stuff because apparently I stole something of his, when I never did.

One instance of him destroying my stuff was when I was around 16. Me and parents went to have dinner with my grandparents on my dad’s side of the family at their place, and when we got there my mother got a phone call from my brother, so she stayed outside and talked to him while me and my dad went inside. After a way my dad went out to see what was up cause mum had been out there for a while and she said that everything was fine, but it wasn’t. We didn’t get home until about 10pm, so I went to room to go to bed cause I was tired but my room was completely trashed and destroyed, including my tv, artworks, Pop Vinyl’s and he had poured Coke in my Xbox.

I ran out of my room screaming that someone had broken into the house, so dad ran to see if anything was taken from the house or if there was a break in but there wasn’t, it was then my mum said that my brother was the one who did it and he told her that he did. That pissed me so I went to go destroy his stuff but my dad had stopped me and sat me down as he proceeded to call my brother and go off at him saying that if he does not apologise to me in an hour that he would change the locks on the doors and call the police on him for destruction of property and for breaking into, but my mother stopped him for doing that. She then turned to me and said that she would pay for anything that was destroyed and that she knew my brother did this.

That’s what broke my heart and my trust in my mum. The fact that she knew he did and didn’t tell me, as well as acting like he didn’t destroy my safe space and that she pay for everything when he should be the paying for it. I was shocked that she would let him do this and I wouldn’t learn until years later that she never told anyone about it and my mum never took me to see a therapist or anything after this happened, especially since I had just moved schools since I was getting bullied at school by my very first group of friends that I had known for years at my previous school.

A couple years later when I was 20, I moved in with my grandparents on my mother side of the family because my brother and his partner needed to move in with my parents since they had to find a new place to live couldn’t find one in time. It was also at this time that I went to see a therapist for the first time because I have a massive mental health breakdown in public. I didn’t know that they they would be moving in until the night before because I overheard my mum on the phone with my brother so I went off at her for not telling me when she knows all he has done to me and so the afternoon of the day my brother and his partner moved in I moved out into my grandparents place for 4 months. It was then when I learned the rest of the family had no idea what was going on, cause my aunt and uncle would stop at my grandparents place nearly every afternoon to pick up my cousin, who would get off the bus there after school. And needless to say my aunt was not happy to the point where she went off at my brother at the Christmas breakfast she holds for her family.

And top it off a year later my dad was diagnosed with a secondary throat cancer and that they can’t find the primary source to this day. So when my dad had to go get a pet scan he had to fast until after the scan and my mum and brother went with that day and after the scan dad just wanted to sit down and have a coffee and some food, but my mum and brother just wanted to go home and so they went home not caring about what my dad wanted. A couple months later dad had to go to a hospital in Sydney and get 42 lymph nodes removed for his next and the doctors told mum that she has to be there for him when they got home since he wouldn’t be able to do a few things that he could in that past, within the first week my mum pulled away and wasn’t there for which has led to them separating and my dad being diagnosed with depression and anxiety as well.

So many people that I have told this too have agreed that I’m in the right for not forgiving them and others and said that I’m in the wrong and should forgive them.

So am I the asshole for not forgiving my mum and brother to this day?

The book took me on a beautiful journey through 21 Goan homes, each one brimming with its own family history, quirks, and legends. Every page feels like stepping into someone’s living room, listening to stories over a cup of chai, while admiring hand carved balcaos and tiled verandahs.

When it arrived, we were actually in the middle of renovating our ancestral home, so it couldn’t have come at a better time. The book gave us a wonderful peek into local styles, materials, and how every home carries the personality of its people.
What I especially loved was how Heta blends architecture with anecdotes, tales of families, traditions, the daily dilemmas of preservation, and the values of unity and resilience that define Goan life. And let’s not forget the photographs, lush, detailed, and full of life.

1o0wudx,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1o0wudx/more_than_meets_the_eye/,More Than Meets the Eye,"Clara had been on dating apps long enough to stop expecting much. Most matches fizzled after a few messages, and the rare ones that made it to a first date usually ended with polite goodbyes and empty promises to text. But **Noelle** felt different from the start.

Her profile had been short and playful: *“Professional daydreamer ☁️ | Coffee > Everything ☕ | Model sometimes 📸.”* Nothing too flashy, but her smile was captivating — confident and real. And their conversations? They *clicked*. No awkward small talk, no dead-end replies. They talked about their favorite books, their worst vacations, and what they’d do if they won the lottery. Clara found herself laughing at messages, checking her phone more than usual, waiting for the next notification from Noelle.

After a few days of nonstop texting and late-night voice notes, Clara did something she rarely did anymore: she said yes to a date.

“Saturday afternoon? Coffee?” Noelle suggested.  
“Perfect,” Clara replied. “I’ll be the one nervously drinking three cappuccinos before you arrive.”  
“Then I’ll make sure to arrive fashionably five minutes late,” Noelle teased back.

The café they picked was small and warm, the kind of place with mismatched furniture and indie music playing just a little too loudly. Clara arrived early — of course she did — and grabbed a corner table with a good view of the door. Her heart was thumping harder than she wanted to admit.

*It’s just a coffee,* she told herself. *It’s not a big deal.*

She checked her phone for the hundredth time. No new messages. She adjusted her hair, glanced at the door again, and started scrolling through their chat to kill time. That was when she heard a voice.

“Clara?”

It was gentle, familiar. Clara looked up — and then her breath caught.

Noelle was there. The same bright smile from her pictures, the same sharp eyes she’d seen in selfies. But she wasn’t standing. She was seated in a compact wheelchair — and as she rolled closer, Clara’s eyes widened as the truth sank in.

Noelle had **no arms or legs.**

She moved with surprising ease, maneuvering the chair with subtle motions of her torso and head. Her sleeves and pant legs ended smoothly — no prosthetics, nothing hidden. Just Noelle, exactly as she was.

For a moment, Clara forgot how to breathe.

“Surprise?” Noelle said, smiling nervously. “This is… probably not what you were expecting.”

Clara blinked, her thoughts racing.  
“No,” she admitted softly. “Not at all.”

“I should’ve told you,” Noelle said quickly. “I *usually* do. But I liked how we were talking, and I didn’t want this to be the first thing you knew about me.”

Clara felt her heartbeat settle. She gestured to the seat across from her. “Please, sit — I mean, uh…” She stopped herself and laughed nervously. “Sorry. You *are* sitting.”

Noelle laughed too, the tension in her shoulders easing. “Happens all the time. Don’t worry.”

They sat there for a few seconds, neither quite sure what to say. Finally, Clara broke the silence.  
“So… no arms, no legs.”

“Nope,” Noelle said matter-of-factly. “Lost them when I was eighteen. Car accident. Whole story, long recovery. But I’m here. Still me.”

Clara nodded slowly. “You seem… really okay with it.”

“I am,” Noelle said. “It took time. A lot of time. But this is me now. I live alone, I work, I travel, I model for inclusive fashion brands. I even make terrible lasagna. Life didn’t stop.”

Clara smiled at that. “Terrible lasagna is a crime, but I can forgive you.”

“Thank you. That means a lot,” Noelle said with mock seriousness.

The conversation flowed more naturally after that. They talked about everything — the accident, the recovery, how Noelle learned to navigate the world differently. Clara asked questions, careful not to pry, and Noelle answered them all with openness and humor. She explained how she types with a stylus strapped to a headband, how she paints by holding a brush in her mouth, and how she refuses to use prosthetics because she prefers the body she has now.

At some point, Clara realized she had completely forgotten about her initial shock. They were laughing about childhood cartoons, swapping book recommendations, and arguing over which Pokémon starter was the best. It felt easy — *real.*

Two hours passed before they noticed the café was nearly empty.

“I had a great time,” Noelle said as they lingered by the door. “I was worried you’d bolt.”

“I thought about it for, like, half a second,” Clara admitted with a grin. “But then I realized I’d be missing out on someone pretty amazing.”

Noelle’s cheeks flushed slightly. “You mean that?”

“I do,” Clara said. “And I hope this isn’t the last time we do this.”

“Only if you promise to give my lasagna another chance,” Noelle teased.

“Deal,” Clara said, smiling as they exchanged goodbyes.

Later that night, lying in bed, Clara replayed the day in her head. The surprise had been real — intense, even. But more powerful was the connection that hadn’t gone anywhere. Noelle wasn’t defined by what she didn’t have. She was confident, funny, resilient — and more authentic than anyone Clara had met in years.

And as she drifted off to sleep, Clara smiled at the thought:

You work, you earn, and then you spend — simple, right? You buy a cup of coffee for $5, a meal for $20, a car, a house, whatever you need.

But here’s the truth:  
You’re not paying with money.  
You’re paying with time — with your life.

That $5 coffee didn’t really cost you five dollars. It cost you a few minutes of your life that you spent earning those dollars. Every transaction is just a tiny exchange of your limited time on Earth for something you want right now.

If you really think about it, it’s shocking.  
You can never get that time back.  
Money can be replaced — time cannot.

When you start looking at life this way, everything changes. That luxury item might not seem worth three weeks of your life. That extra hour at work might not be worth missing dinner with your family.

We’ve built a system where we trade hours for dollars, but we rarely stop to ask what those hours are really worth to us personally.

So next time you buy something, pause for a second.  
Don’t ask, “Can I afford it?”  
Ask, “Is it worth a piece of my life?”

Or alternatively, is there any way to meet people and make friends outside of registering for classes at community college (which I'm going to be trying out soon)? Appreciative of the advice in advance!",2,1759884948.0,ChicagoSuburbs,3,1.0,False

Got a ticket from one of the directors, so I thought I’d be proactive and reach out to him in the office.
Naturally, I check Teams to see what he looks like.

Click his profile.. and I’m greeted by what can only be described as an AI-generated headshot from the Windows XP era.
Perfect skin, mysterious blur, warm studio lighting.

So there I am, wandering around the office like a lost intern, trying to match this perfectly airbrushed corporate relic to an actual human.
Spoiler: the real guy looks nothing like that picture. Easily 20 years older


Anyone else notice this trend? Or is my new office stuck in a parallel timeline where everyone still looks like their 2003 LinkedIn profile? 😅",48,1759884941.0,sysadmin,11,0.86,False
1o0wpp5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0wpp5,AIO my roommate helps himself to my food and steals my coffee but I feel like I'm in too much trouble,"I don't know if I got too angry but I got up to go to the doctor and there was no more coffee or milk. I suspected it was him but when in doubt I preferred to ask and that really annoyed me. I'm not often angry but it's been 3 days that another inhabitant of the house speaks to me very badly as if he had authority over me and in a language that I have little mastery of knowing him little (I would like to make another post on this on a Polish roommate who judges me without knowing me speaks to me like a child or a dog, allows himself remarks and intrusions for things that are not serious and boring except that we don't have the same native language. Do you know where I can ask for advice in sub?) In short I am I was tense all the time and the fact that my roommate Édouard was stealing things from me pissed me off.
Already it's not the first time that this happens, I don't have too much butter or I find it dirty and started, I already told him yes for a glass of pulco now he helps himself, water that I had chilled for my day, milk... it started with a large glass of iced tea in front of my eyes I said nothing I was dismayed and terribly embarrassed. Then he and his girlfriend used my coffee machine, I told them yes to borrow the pitcher but I never gave my consent for 6 fucking capsules of my dolce gusto and the empty box when I got home. 
Again, it captivated me, I was shocked, I found it so cheeky... I insisted that they buy back what they took lol, they got the wrong model. 
The 3 of us lived together then there was the arrival of the other 4 roommates and the divorce of Édouard and his girlfriend. 
I didn't care, I had my health problems to manage but I also suspected it a little... he needed to talk, to find answers, I really took pleasure in advising him and my advice was beneficial because he resolved a problem with her thanks to me. Great, it's cool, even I'm satisfied with it. But that doesn't mean that I'm available all the time, this weekend I was eating in front of my video and I was sending text messages he talked about that but left, another time I was on the phone outside there too he was disillusioned... I'm not at his disposal. 
But this morning the coffee episode was too much. I gave him my leaves, filters and fire because I smoke more, yesterday I prepared a quiche Lorraine I reserved one part for him and another for the Vietnamese roommate I did it well wrapped with a note. I have the impression that he is using me, I know that he is very first degree, very very non-chalant, that he has no social life and that he cannot work because of his epilepsy but that does not excuse the absence of questioning which makes me repeat and repeat only to end up having a breakdown in the WhatsApp of the whole roommate. I would add to that that the Polish's relentlessness on me is also due to the fact that his ex doesn't clean up when she comes except that he doesn't either so I go behind and get tackled, it's tiring and I was still very perplexed when using my new machine, not installed, not in the drinks cabinet at the beginning I said to myself that it reduces the problem, I don't know why I said that to myself given that the machine is in his corner and that he knows neither the owner nor the usefulness of this object.
I don't want to live with princess men and privileged men who play on my lazy nerves. I have enough mental load with my little self, men are annoying, no thank you really.",2,1759884924.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.75,False
