1l5lps8,https://i.redd.it/bp604vywii5f1.jpeg,Last Day on Getaway - AMA,"Spending our last day at sea on board the Norwegian Getaway. We are on a 7 Day Bermuda cruise from NYC. This is our second time on Getaway, fourth Bermuda cruise, and 26th NCL cruise. Happy to answer any questions you have while we‚Äôre onboard üõ≥Ô∏è

Here are some quick observations and changes we have noticed: 

The American Diner has been open every morning as a satellite buffet station and has been a lot less crowded than the Garden Caf√©. It‚Äôs also open daily from 12:30 PM to 4:30 PM for lunch - not just sea days. 

The main dining room menus have been updated as of 5/25 and have changed slightly. The biggest change is that the grilled New York strip steak is now rotating every other night with a Montreal spice rubbed brisket.
Cagney‚Äôs premium cuts are back, replacing the ‚ÄúTaste of Specialty‚Äù offerings.

Only one show on board requires reservations now ‚Äî the 90s show. Some of Syd Norman‚Äôs Pour House events have been moved to the main theater to accommodate larger crowds.

They‚Äôve added a walled-off smoking section inside the casino. This helps, but it still smells

Shanghai‚Äôs has reverted back to being complimentary and now requires reservations. The menu is the same as 2024.

I spoke with some crew members who said Moderno will be removed during the next dry dock, similar to the changes on other ships in this class. Cagney‚Äôs will be expanded into that space.

Steaks at most specialty restaurants (except Cagney‚Äôs and Le Bistro) have dropped from filet mignon to New York strip steak. 

Some bar staff won‚Äôt use brand liquors even if you ask. For example, I requested a Patr√≥n margarita and still got house tequila. We noticed this at the larger bars, so it may be an efficiency cutback. Maybe it‚Äôs a one off thing, but then why bother having an extensive MAS menu?

They have the Starbucks Getaway mugs onboard.

Premium WiFi has been very slow and spotty. 

In the mornings before 10am there is a roving cart on the waterfront with coffee and pastries. This was really nice and hopefully continues on other ships/itineraries. 

We‚Äôve done this Bermuda itinerary four times, and this cruise stood out because the typical port-day behavior just wasn‚Äôt there. Usually, as soon as the ship docks, most passengers head out and spend the full day exploring. The next day is the same ‚Äî busy beaches, full-day excursions, and then a more relaxed final morning around the Dockyard. That usually leaves the ship pretty empty during the day. But on this sailing, a lot more people seem to be staying onboard. Many are doing just one excursion and then returning to the ship, or skipping the port altogether. It‚Äôs a noticeable shift. Instead of the usual ‚ÄúI paid to be in Bermuda, so I‚Äôm going to make the most of it‚Äù mindset, this time it feels more like ‚ÄúI paid to be on the ship, so I‚Äôm going to enjoy the food, drinks, and amenities.‚Äù

We are staying in a forward facing Oceanview on deck 13. The room is spacious and has a nice bench in front of the window. The waters are a little rough today, but from our room it feels significantly worse than on the waterfront. You have to keep the curtains closed at night because it could cause a glare on the water for the bridge. Heightened movement aside, we really like the room. (Photo is the view from our room!)

1l5lkcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1l5lkcc/objects_i_actively_avoid_appearing_in_front_of_me/,Objects I actively avoid appearing in front of me constantly,"I was a very clumsy child. I never looked where I was going and was always running into things. Getting hurt so much as a child taught me to pay more attention as an adult.

I actively go out of my way to avoid getting hurt. Like stubbing my toe, running into walls, hitting knees on tables (I'm very short so this is common, typically a coffee table), letting doors go over my toes. That sort of thing. 

Well I've noticed a lot over the years if I look away from something and keep walking, the object I avoid somehow appears in front of me and I hurt myself anyway. For example, last week I was folding laundry and was going into my daughter's room to put it away. She has a small trampoline in her room and I purposely went to the side to avoid running into it. I looked away and kept walking to the dresser and just a few steps from where I was going I hit my toe hard on the bottom of it. 

We also have a small coffee table in my home with very sharp corners. I usually go to opposite way of it to avoid it altogether but sometimes I have to walk close to it and no matter how far away I walk a corner always goes into my thigh and leaves a nasty bruise. 

I stand as far away as possible from doors. Car doors, house door, business doors it doesn't matter. My car door has hit me in the face or leg no matter how far away I am. House doors almost always run over my toes and hurt me unless I'm directly looking directly down at my feet. I've even tested it. I've stood the same amount of distance and looking down, nothing happens. If I look forward so I can walk in my intended direction, I'm getting hurt. 

At my job I'm always running into walls or tables. I carry trays for work and I've always got bruised arms because of hitting the wall and the tray hits my arm. We also store brooms upright on the wall and no matter how far I go out of my way to avoid them they suddenly appear next to me and I run into them. 

I feel like I'm a video game character being controlled by someone else. It feels like the universe is glitching me next to these objects or these objects next to me. ",1,1749304970.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,0,1.0,False

I've loved gleaning new insights and perspectives about the world, enrichening my understanding of a new subculture and weaving more details into my mental models.

I love the accompanying novelty rush on learning something new. I love the satisfaction of having articulated an interesting thought. The digestion of new information always excites me.

Having said that, I am not in the least interested in going back to college. Formal education kills the excitement of learning and instead burdens with various tensions like exams, grades, assignments, deadlines and so on. I love learning free and unencumbered from it.

I've always thought learning begins more after leaving school or college. I would like to connect with other people who have a similar mindset - discuss our daily systems and habits to stay in touch with learning about the world

I realised how much I love learning about things while discussing books with somebody and revisiting my non fiction collection. I have books on all kinds of curiosities - ranging from the history of colour to the reason the English alphabets are organised in the order they are (not phonetically like most languages).

I would love to interact with people who have similar passions and exchange good articles and insights everyday with each other - and feed our interest further.

Subjects I like learning about

* **Mathematics**¬†\- I love Mathematics. I don't have as much time to keep up with it actively now, but I do read articles on Quanta to keep up with latest development.
* **Programming**¬†\- I love participating in programming contests
* **Chess**¬†\- I am not very good in chess, but I love it. I have so many books on chess that I still have to read ! I follow various YouTubers on it
* **Reading**¬†\- I do like reading books - both fiction and non fiction.
* **Sports Trivia -**¬†The way I consume sports is through remembering and analysing trivia. I find it fascinating that almost every sporting event will lead to something happening that has not happened before.

There are various other topics I am interested in - even if I am not an expert in them like **psychology, history, international affairs** and so on.

Mediums I like to keep track of information from

* **Podcasts** \- I do love listening to podcasts. I recently heard a podcast about the differences between natural an lab made diamonds and learnt about the economics of the jewellery industry. I listen to podcasts about science outreach, international affairs an a few fictional ones too in my native language.
* **Books**
* **Blogs** \- I follow some blogs like Quanta
* **Magazines** \- I have subscriptions to **MIT Technology Review, Wired and New in Chess**. I also follow some free magazines like **IEEE Spectrum and Resonance.**
* **Reddit -** I try to curate my feed to get new bits of information now and then. I have found out about things as esoteric as a world coffee championship through Reddit.

I love organising things I learn in notes in beautiful ways. I maintain notes about it - though I am not always regular in updating it. I would love to know about different systems other people have and learn more.

I look forward to getting to know you.",1,1749304952.0,InternetFriends,0,1.0,False

Clean lines, rich wood textures, and that cozy-yet-cool retro vibe‚Äîit works in almost any home. The only downside? Furnishing an entire mid century modern living room can seem expensive at first glance. But good news: it doesn‚Äôt have to be. Here‚Äôs how anyone can put together a stylish, comfortable space without breaking the bank.

Start with the sofa. This is the heart of any living room, so it makes sense to invest in a standout piece. The[ Fargo Chesterfield Genuine Leather Sofa in Tan](https://midinmod.com/products/fargo-chesterfield-genuine-leather-sofa-couch-tan?_pos=1&_psq=fargo&_ss=e&_v=1.0) is a great example‚Äîauthentic leather, deep seating, and that classic mid century modern furniture silhouette. It sets the tone and makes the whole space feel more pulled together.

Next up: the coffee table. The[ Kare Walnut Center Table](https://midinmod.com/products/kare-walnut-center-table) is a budget-friendly find that brings in natural wood tones without taking over the room. It pairs well with a wide range of mid century modern interior pieces and keeps the room feeling open and light.

For extra seating, the[ Kira Rocking Chair](https://midinmod.com/products/kira-rocking-chair) offers a sculptural look and serious comfort. It‚Äôs one of those pieces that draws attention without overwhelming the space‚Äîa smart choice for any mid century modern home setup.

A simple[ Kare Walnut End Table](https://midinmod.com/products/kare-walnut-endtable) adds balance and function, perfect next to a chair or sofa. It‚Äôs little details like these that complete the room without adding clutter.

To round things out, a clean-lined media setup like the[ Noak Solid Wood TV Stand](https://midinmod.com/products/noak-solid-wood-tv-stand) helps maintain that minimal aesthetic. It‚Äôs functional, stylish, and blends seamlessly with other mid century modern pieces.

Finish it off with a vintage or thrifted mid century modern floor lamp, some houseplants, and maybe a pop of color with mid century modern colorful couches or throw pillows.

The key? Build piece by piece. Choose a few statement items like a bold mid century modern chair or mid century modern coffee table, and layer in simple accents over time. Anyone can create a beautiful, budget-friendly mid century modern living room with a little planning and creativity.

1l5li1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TruckingNews/comments/1l5li1y/smart_spending_on_the_road_practical_moneysaving/,Smart Spending on the Road: Practical Money-Saving Strategies for Truck Drivers,"# Practical Money-Saving Strategies for Truck Drivers

Life on the road as a truck driver comes with its own set of financial challenges.¬†From fluctuating fuel prices to daily meal expenses, costs can quickly add up.¬†However, with strategic planning and mindful habits, truckers can significantly reduce their on-the-road expenses.¬†Here are practical strategies to help truck drivers save money while navigating the highways.

# 1.¬†Master the Art of Budgeting

Understanding your income and expenses is the cornerstone of financial stability.¬†Documenting all sources of income and categorizing expenses‚Äîboth fixed (like insurance and loan payments) and variable (like meals and fuel)‚Äîcan provide clarity on spending habits.¬†[Regularly reviewing and adjusting your budget](https://prodriver.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-budgeting-for-truck-drivers)¬†ensures you stay on track and identify areas for potential savings.

# 2.¬†Plan and Prepare Meals

Eating out frequently can strain your wallet and impact your health.¬†Investing in a portable cooler or mini-fridge allows you to store fresh ingredients.¬†Preparing meals in advance not only saves money but also ensures you have healthier options readily available.¬†Simple meals like sandwiches, salads, and pre-cooked proteins can be both nutritious and cost-effective.

# 3.¬†Optimize Fuel Consumption

Fuel is one of the most significant expenses for truck drivers.¬†[To maximize fuel efficiency](https://www.cdlexpert.com/post/how-to-save-money-as-a-truck-driver-essential-tips-for-smart-spending-on-the-road):

* **Maintain Steady Speeds**:¬†Using cruise control on highways can help maintain consistent speeds, reducing fuel consumption.
* **Reduce Idling**:¬†Extended idling burns fuel unnecessarily.¬†Turn off the engine during long stops when safe to do so.
* **Regular Maintenance**:¬†Keeping your truck in top condition ensures optimal fuel efficiency.¬†Regularly check tire pressure, replace air filters, and ensure timely oil changes.

# 4.¬†Leverage Loyalty Programs and Discounts

Many truck stops and service centers offer loyalty programs that provide discounts on fuel, meals, and other services.¬†Signing up for these programs can lead to significant savings over time.¬†Additionally, always inquire about¬†[CDL discounts](https://blog.drive4ats.com/lower-trucking-operating-costs-how-to)¬†at hotels, restaurants, and retail stores.

# 5.¬†Utilize Technology for Savings

Modern technology offers various tools to help truckers save money:

* **Fuel Price Apps**:¬†Apps like¬†[GasBuddy](https://www.gasbuddy.com/)¬†can help you find the cheapest fuel prices along your route.
* **Navigation Tools**:¬†Using GPS apps tailored for truckers can help avoid toll roads and find efficient routes, saving both time and money.
* **Expense Tracking Apps**:¬†Keeping track of your expenses digitally can provide insights into spending patterns and areas for potential savings.

# 6.¬†Invest in Essential Equipment

While there‚Äôs an upfront cost, investing in equipment like a good-quality cooler, portable stove, or coffee maker can lead to long-term savings.¬†Preparing your own meals and beverages reduces the need to spend at restaurants and cafes.

# 7.¬†Avoid Impulse Purchases

It‚Äôs easy to make spontaneous purchases at truck stops or convenience stores.¬†To combat this:

* **Make a Shopping List**:¬†Stick to a list when shopping to avoid unnecessary items.
* **Set Spending Limits**:¬†Allocate a specific amount for discretionary spending each week.
* **Reflect Before Buying**:¬†Before making a purchase, consider if it‚Äôs a need or a want.

# 8.¬†Regularly Review and Adjust

Financial planning isn‚Äôt a one-time task.¬†Regularly reviewing your budget, expenses, and savings goals ensures you stay aligned with your financial objectives.¬†Adjusting your strategies based on changing circumstances can lead to continued financial success.

By implementing these strategies, truck drivers can navigate the financial challenges of life on the road more effectively.¬†Proactive planning, mindful spending, and leveraging available resources can lead to substantial savings and financial peace of mind.

I fell asleep after my first shot Thursday not knowing what awaited me in the days ahead, but still cautiously optimistic. The first thing I noticed when I woke up a few hours later was a weird ‚Äúmediciney‚Äù  taste in my mouth. It was kind of like the unpleasant taste that I had when I took Paxlovid after getting a bad case of Covid a couple of years ago, but not quite that strong. And fortunately, it didn‚Äôt last. I did have lots of trouble sleeping though, but that‚Äôs normal for me, so I‚Äôm used to it. However, I wasn‚Äôt used to drinking as much water as I did throughout the night. My mouth kept feeling dry, so I just kept craving H2O like a fish needs it. I thought that I might want a small snack to eat with it, but I never felt motivated to actually go into the kitchen and get one. The morning came and I poured my usual cup of coffee, and things got weird. First of all, the coffee didn‚Äôt taste like coffee, but also it did. I‚Äôm not really sure how to describe it. I added a little bit of cream to it as I usually do, but I couldn‚Äôt even motivate myself to finish the cup. It made me feel a little nauseous and my heart felt like it was racing, so I may have to step back from drinking coffee for a while. The rest of the day I just felt queasy and tired with almost no appetite, practically forcing myself to eat. Now I‚Äôm wondering what else I should expect with food and drinks to come.

Breakfast: Raspberry Greek yogurt with blueberries and granola  
Lunch: Half an apple with peanut butter  
Dinner: Ground turkey hard-shell tacos

I just noticed it was stored improperly with water still in the resivour. It still works, but I'm concerned about contamination and safety now as bacteria likely has infested that water quite heavily - How can I be sure the machine will be safe to use. Obviously descaler or vinegar aren't sure fire methods to ensure the entire machine will be sterile for use. I can disinfect the resivour itself pretty reasonably but I'm not so sure about the rest of the machine.

I‚Äôm seeing people post one-line bios like ""looking for fun"" and getting matches. But me? Just one genuine date

But I still have hope. There must be someone out there who also just wants to breathe, smile, talk about random things, and enjoy a simple day. No tension, no awkwardness.

So if you're someone who‚Äôd enjoy a drive with some Rahman in the background, some laughs over masala dosa, and a peaceful dinner where no one‚Äôs pretending , drop me a message.

 I have been loading up the hopper with the same beans (just an off-the-shelf medium-dark roast) while I've been riding the learning curve. 

I now want to start looking into single dosing so I can vary the beans I'm using. I've been doing pour-over for a bit, and one thing I  enjoy is being able to try different coffees all the time. 

What I'm looking for is the best way to do this with espresso. 

I understand that small adjustments need to be made for the grind setting for different beans, but how easy is this on the Barista Express?

1. Do people pick a ""standard"" espresso bean, keep their setup up for that, and just do everything else manual for different beans (i.e., not use the built in grinder, not use the preprogrammed espresso setting)
2. Is it easy enough to adjust the grind setting on the in-built grinder on the fly, and is the preprogrammed espresso setting consistent across different beans?

Imagine walking down the street, coffee in hand, when you spot a glowing machine in the corner store. It‚Äôs not an arcade game or a soda dispenser‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a **Bitcoin ATM**! Welcome to the future ‚Äî where your local bodega might just double as a crypto exchange.

Bitcoin ATMs (or BTMs if you want to sound extra cool) are popping up *everywhere* ‚Äî gas stations, malls, corner shops, even laundromats. These machines let anyone buy or sell Bitcoin with ease, using nothing more than a phone and a few taps on the screen. It's like having your own mini crypto exchange on the go.

But here‚Äôs the catch: to use a Bitcoin ATM, you need a **Bitcoin wallet address**, and the easiest way to share that with the machine is via a **QR code**. That‚Äôs where our app comes in to save the day ‚Äî superhero cape and all. ü¶∏

Introducing the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) ‚Äî your friendly crypto sidekick that lets you whip up a sleek, scannable QR code in seconds. Just enter your Bitcoin address, choose your style, and boom üí•‚Äî you‚Äôve got a QR code ready to show any ATM, friend, or client.

Using a Bitcoin ATM without a QR code is like trying to pay for coffee with exact change in pennies ‚Äî technically possible, but no one wants to be *that* person. With our QR code maker, you just scan and go. No typing out long, clunky addresses. No awkward errors. Just clean, instant transactions.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. Go to [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)
2. Paste in your Bitcoin address (don‚Äôt worry, we don‚Äôt store anything!)
3. Choose from cool styles like Classic, Taproot, or even bold neon vibes üí°
4. Generate your code and save it or print it ‚Äî perfect for business displays or personal use!

Now, combine that with a Bitcoin ATM, and you‚Äôve got a match made in crypto heaven. Whether you‚Äôre buying Bitcoin on your lunch break or cashing some out on a road trip, the combo of ATM + QR code makes it faster than a contactless coffee payment.

And hey ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt just for the tech elite anymore. Grandma‚Äôs getting Bitcoin birthday gifts, teens are stacking sats, and small shops are accepting BTC for cookies. If you‚Äôve got a Bitcoin address, our app helps you share it like a pro.

So next time you see a Bitcoin ATM, don‚Äôt just walk past it ‚Äî **own it**. Fire up [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), flash your code, and join the growing wave of everyday Bitcoiners making crypto *actually* convenient.

My symptoms include sudden breath loss, heart palpitations and arrythmia, occasional SVT episodes and pain in the upper chest area, mostly left side. Besides that, sometimes I do experience regrutation but it doesn't bother me much. 

After numerous tests, doctors say my heart is fine and that my hearnia doesn't require surgery.

I had to quit smoking (happy for that) and coffee which I love but I startet getting panic attacks by drinking it. I also get symptoms by drinking carbonated drinks, eating fat food and sweets. I can often feel my stomach on the left side or upper chest which is weird.
I had to give up on a lot of things and the worst part is that my symptoms are still not gone. My last gastroenterologist told me to talk to a psychiatrist....like wtf?

I am seriously considering surgery at this point because i want my life back and be able to relax when drinking or whatever I am doing and not to constantly think about this shit. 

The issue for me is to find a doctor willing to do surgery because I have been told that nobody would want to do it. Has anyone here done surgery on smaller hernias with these kind of symptoms?

I‚Äôm not ready for that.‚Äù","Hey,‚Äù he said with his sexy grin. I wanted to hurl something at him to make that smile go away. It needed a warning label, too. I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to talk to him. ‚ÄúNan isn‚Äôt here,‚Äù I replied. She hadn‚Äôt been back since she‚Äôd left for Rosemary the last time. I was sure that was where Grant had run off to as well. He had gone to find her. Like he always did. Yeah, I know,‚Äù he replied. I really should‚Äôve gone back to swimming and ignored him. It was the smart thing to do. But then he could possibly take that as an invitation to join me. ‚ÄúWhat do you need?‚Äù I asked, in the most annoyed tone I could muster. I came to see you. It seems once a guy kisses you, you‚Äôre hard to forget,‚Äù he replied.  
 Not what I had been expecting. I swallowed the nervous knot in my throat. I would cave and forgive him too easily if he started saying things like that. Where had my backbone gone? I used to be stronger than this. You‚Äôre mad because I left,‚Äù he said. I thought about retorting and changed my mind. That would only give him more power. He didn‚Äôt need to know he affected me at all. It was a jackass thing to do. But you scared me. I like to flirt with beautiful girls, but I don‚Äôt handle it well when one simple kiss makes my fucking head spin. You make me want things and feel a certain way. I‚Äôm not ready for that. I was expecting a lame I‚Äôm sorry; not that. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù was the only thing I could come up with. What did it mean, exactly, that our kiss made his head spin? Was that a good thing? It sounded like it . . . maybe. Grant ran a hand through his long, unruly hair and let out a frustrated sigh. ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have left you without an explanation. It was unfair and I was only thinking of myself. I‚Äôm good at that. I just . . . what can I do to get you to forgive me? He still wasn‚Äôt asking for forgiveness. He was asking how to get forgiveness. Had anyone ever asked me how to get forgiveness before? How . . . unique. Warning bells were going off in my head loudly, but somehow I ignored that. Because my heart wanted to forgive him. I didn‚Äôt want to push him away. No one ever took this much time to get to know me. Being lonely was something I had grown used to. Having someone here who wanted to get to know me bad enough to admit he was wrong, someone who cared to ask me how he could fix it, meant more than he realized.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it again,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† Grant‚Äôs eyes went wide and then a slow smile slid across his handsome face. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stepped back as he started tugging his shirt over his head. He threw it aside and slipped off his shoes, and then his eyes lifted to meet mine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not leaving this time. When you get tired of me, you‚Äôll have to force me out.‚Äù  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt keep the silly smile off my face.  
  
¬† Two months and two weeks ago . . .  
  
¬† When the door to my room clicked behind us, I knew this was it. For a week, we had been kissing and touching. It was hard for us to keep our hands off each other. Grant made me feel things I didn‚Äôt know were possible. He showed me what a real orgasm was. He had also taught me that screaming out in pleasure was okay. He liked it when I was loud. It always made him more frantic. His breathing would accelerate and his eyes would almost glow from excitement.  
  
¬† But tonight, I wanted more. I wasn‚Äôt going to stop things when they got too far. I wasn‚Äôt going to make him keep my shirt on. I was going to let us do what we both wanted. I was twenty years old. It was time I became a real woman and had sex. I was holding on to my virginity like some grand prize, and I wanted to experience a total connection with another human being. I wanted to know what it felt like to have Grant inside me. To get as close to each other as possible. I wanted this experience.  
  
¬† Grant‚Äôs arms wrapped around me from behind as his mouth touched my neck and began taking small nibbles. That always made my knees a little weak. ‚ÄúYou taste too damn good,‚Äù he whispered in my ear, making me tremble. ‚ÄúI want your shirt off. I‚Äôve been thinking about pulling one of your nipples into my mouth all week.‚Äù  
  
¬† His hands found my hem and pulled my shirt up over my head, then he unsnapped my bra. He pulled it from my body and froze. I knew he would see it. I was prepared for that. His hand reached out and ran along the line across my chest that was so faint now, it wasn‚Äôt even very noticeable.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI was a preemie. I was born ten weeks too early. I had some surgeries before I was in the clear.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to explain anymore. He didn‚Äôt need to know the truth. That was enough. He lowered his mouth to my chest and instead of kissing my breasts he kissed the scar. I closed my eyes because it made me feel guilty for not being completely honest. Then both his large, tanned hands covered my breasts and I sighed from the pleasure of it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDoes that feel good, pretty girl?‚Äù  
  
¬† I managed a nod as he began to kiss my neck and squeeze my nipples gently.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, baby, arch that back for me.‚Äù  
  
¬† I hadn‚Äôt even realized I was doing it but I was. I couldn‚Äôt get close enough to his touch. The way he made me feel was intoxicating. I craved it. Grant had opened up this world to me with so much pleasure and excitement that I hadn‚Äôt realized existed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLie down on your back. I want to kiss these needy little nipples.‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt argue. I wanted it, too. I climbed on the bed and lay back just in time to see Grant pull his shirt over his head. See the tattoo on his shoulder that came down over his right pec. I wasn‚Äôt sure what it was, but it was sexy. It looked like some sort of tribal print. Then some Chinese symbols were on his chest just above his pecs. I planned on asking him about them, but not now.  
  
¬† He reached for his jeans and unbuttoned them. I was fascinated with his lower abdomen. All those tight ripples in his stomach, the way his hipbones stuck out, and the small patch of hair that started low, just under the band of his underwear. I wanted to see exactly what it looked like under there, but until tonight I hadn‚Äôt gotten a chance. Grant always got my panties off but he said he needed to keep his pants on if he was going to keep his head straight. I didn‚Äôt push. But I wanted to see.  
  
¬† I lay there as he crawled over me and stared down at me with a sexy, hungry look in his eyes. He didn‚Äôt break his gaze as he lowered his mouth to my breast and pulled a nipple into his mouth. I watched him. It made my stomach quiver and I had to squeeze my legs together to ease the ache between them.  
  
¬† He let it pop out of his mouth, then stuck his tongue out and flicked it with a grin before moving over and giving the other one the same attention.  
  
¬† I grabbed handfuls of the covers underneath me to keep from crying out. It felt so good. The warmth of his mouth anywhere on my body was amazing, but when he found the sensitive areas it made it even more incredible.  
  
¬† When that nipple popped free of his mouth he started kissing down my stomach, and I knew his next step would be to pull my shorts off. He would use his mouth to send me flying off into bliss. I wanted more than that tonight.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTake off your pants,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† He froze and his eyes lifted back to me as he pressed a kiss just below my belly button. ‚ÄúYou know the rules. I can‚Äôt do that. I don‚Äôt trust myself.‚Äù  
  
¬† I swallowed against the nervous knot in my throat. ‚ÄúI want . . . I want you to take your pants off. I‚Äôm not worried about keeping you from doing anything . . .‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure how you told a guy you were ready. I hadn‚Äôt ever been in that position before.  
  
¬† Grant frowned for a moment, then his eyes flashed with that bright, excited gleam he would get when I came down from the highs he sent me on. ‚ÄúAre you telling me I can finally feel just how fucking amazing you are?‚Äù  
  
¬† I had been prepared for him to say fuck me or screw me but this . . . this was better. It was real. Calling it anything more or making it romantic would cheapen it somehow. This was about mutual attraction, and I got that. I didn‚Äôt need pretty words that he didn‚Äôt mean. I needed honesty, and he seemed to get that.  
  
¬† Grant moved over m  
e and placed a hand on each side of my head as he looked down into my eyes. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to do this. I‚Äôm not asking for it. If you aren‚Äôt ready, I‚Äôm good with that. I‚Äôll wait.‚Äù  
  
¬† Because of that reason alone, I was ready. He meant what he was saying. He didn‚Äôt want to push me. ‚ÄúI want this . . . I want you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù Grant growled and pushed himself off the bed. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a condom. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I thought about that but I was glad he was prepared, even if it bothered me a little bit. He tossed it on the bed. Then, finally, I got to see him unzip his jeans. He let them fall to the floor along with the white boxer briefs he was wearing. I gasped. I had felt it through his jeans many times; once I had rubbed against it until I‚Äôd gotten off. But never had I imagined it was so . . . big. I wasn‚Äôt sure it was going to fit.  
  
¬† He didn‚Äôt leave me time to get too worried about it. He reached up and pulled off my shorts and panties with one firm tug, then he was back on the bed. His hands took both my knees and moved my legs apart. I hadn‚Äôt been ready for him to just go at it. I needed to be eased into this . . .  
  
¬† Grant began kissing the inside of my leg, and he slowly made his way to where I wanted his mouth the most. Once his kiss pressed the top of my mound and I felt his tongue take a long slow trail down to my core, I was ready. My hands clenched the covers as I cried out in relief as he pulled my clit into his mouth.  
  
¬† The first time he‚Äôd done this, I‚Äôd been embarrassed until he had me crying out and panting from the highest level of pleasure. But he hadn‚Äôt let up‚Äîhe‚Äôd done it again. When he‚Äôd left me that night I‚Äôd been exhausted and unable to move.  
  
¬† I had no one to compare him to, but I was positive that Grant was an expert at this. I didn‚Äôt want to dwell on that, either. But the fact was he knew what he was doing. He could make me lose control, and I never lost control.  
  
¬† I felt the familiar building and tightening inside me and my body got excited. It knew how good it felt to reach that height that Grant took me to so easily. Then he stopped and I wanted to scream in protest. I was almost there.  
  
¬† He moved up my body, pressing kisses on my warm, sensitive skin as he worked his way up to my neck.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna put that condom on now,‚Äù he whispered as he moved over to grab the small packet I‚Äôd forgotten about. He ripped it open and I took in the sight of him rolling the protective covering over his large length.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou look scared,‚Äù he said, not moving back to me. I lifted my eyes to look up at him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWill it fit?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† A crooked grin tugged at his lips. ‚ÄúYes, sweet girl. It will.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt so sure. He seemed optimistic.  
  
¬† Grant went back to kissing my neck and nibbling my ear as his body lowered between my open legs. I was going to do this. I wanted it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou seem tense. Have you had a bad experience?‚Äù Grant asked with a frown, puckering his brow. He looked upset.  
  
¬† I shook my head. No, I hadn‚Äôt had a bad experience. I had no experience. Didn‚Äôt he know that? I mean, we hadn‚Äôt talked about it but surely he had figured it out by now.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just, I know what to expect, I think . . . from what I‚Äôve heard.‚Äù  
  
¬† His entire body went rigid as he held himself over me. His frown transformed into a look of surprise. ‚ÄúWhat are you saying? Of course you‚Äôve . . .‚Äù  
  
¬† He didn‚Äôt know. I guess he hadn‚Äôt figured it out after all. ‚ÄúThis is my first time.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant‚Äôs eyes snapped closed and he let out a muttered curse. Did he not like to do it with virgins? Was that a bad thing? I wanted to put some distance between us. For the first time, I felt vulnerable.  
  
¬† He opened his eyes and stared down at me. The tenderness in them took me off guard. He tucked his head into the curve of my neck and shoulder and drew a deep breath. I waited silently.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou chose me‚Äù was all he said. His warm breath against my skin made me shiver, and his body mimicked mine. He pulled back and looked at me. ‚ÄúI will make this good for you. I swear.‚Äù  
  
¬† I never doubted that he would. I knew it was going to hurt me at first. I wasn‚Äôt an idiot about how this worked. I also knew I probably wouldn‚Äôt reach an orgasm this time, but that wasn‚Äôt what this was about. I wanted Grant inside me. I wanted to feel closer to him than I had ever been to anyone. That was all I wanted from this.  
  
¬† Grant pressed his lips to mine gently, then lowered his body until I felt the head of his cock pressing against me. It excited me as much as it scared me. I lifted my hips to reassure him and he slid inside me. When he reached the barrier his eyes locked on mine as he rocked his hips in one swift thrust. I didn‚Äôt cry from the pain‚Äîit was only a burn. He had slid completely inside me and gone still.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so fucking tight,‚Äù he said in a hoarse groan. ‚ÄúDamn. It feels like,‚Äù he panted and ducked his head and took a deep breath, ‚Äúa hot satin glove squeezing me just right. God, baby.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt sure what all that meant, but the way he was panting above me sounded like this felt good to him. It was more than I had expected. I was full. Grant was inside me and I felt complete. I wanted him here.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI gotta move, but damn, I‚Äôm afraid to,‚Äù he said as he slowly pulled out of me then sank back inside me. A low sound came from his chest, which sent pleasure coursing through me. Just seeing him in this much pleasure from being inside me was a major turn-on. I spread my knees and he sank deeper into me and let out a curse that sounded like it had been torn from his chest.  
  
¬† My clit throbbed from just hearing his voice. I was climbing toward that release I recognized and it made me want to beg him to move more. Move harder. Each time he filled me he rubbed against my clit and massaged something inside me. I wasn‚Äôt sure what it was but it felt so good.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFucking amazing,‚Äù he groaned before covering my mouth in a ravenous kiss. He had never kissed me like this before. He was losing control the same way I did when he kissed between my legs. I was reaching that point with him. Seeing him react this way was making my body respond in ways I didn‚Äôt know it could.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt feels good now,‚Äù I assured him.  
  
¬† He tensed and then moved to lower his head back to the corner of my neck and shoulder. ‚ÄúThe pain is completely gone?‚Äù he asked with a low, strangled moan.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I replied. The little sting that was still there was smothered by the pleasure.  
  
¬† He lifted himself up and his gaze locked with mine. His neck muscles flexed and stuck out as his jaw went rigid, like he was holding onto something as hard as he could. ‚ÄúThis is . . . this is more than . . . ,‚Äù he closed his eyes and a pained look came over his face. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt hold out much longer. I‚Äôm so close.‚Äù  
  
¬† His words were all I needed to send me spiraling off to that place I knew he was sending me. I heard him shout out my name as I screamed his and lifted my hips to meet his last thrust. I wrapped my legs around his waist to keep him there. I wanted to feel each spasm of ecstasy with him inside me. I didn‚Äôt want him to move.  
  
¬† I let each cry free as I clung to him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNever been that fucking amazing. You‚Äôve ruined me. Fucking ruined me. I can‚Äôt not have this,‚Äù he said in my ear as he breathed heavily and his body jerked against me.  
  
¬† I agreed. I wanted this. I never imagined that this was what I was missing. I wasn‚Äôt about to let this go. I needed more. My fear of the truth was pushed aside. I couldn‚Äôt stop this. Not now.  
  
¬† Grant  
  
¬† Present day  
  
¬† If I went upstairs after her, there was a chance that Nan would get out of bed and catch me or overhear us. I wasn‚Äôt scared of Nan, but I was scared of what she‚Äôd do to Harlow. I was positive Harlow wasn‚Äôt here by choice. Nan knew she was here last night when she brought me back. She was playing a game here. There was an ulterior motive, but then there always was with Nan. And I‚Äôd walked right fucking into it. Literally.  
  
¬† Kiro wasn‚Äôt a fan of Nan and he adored Harlow. I couldn‚Äôt imagine why he would send Harlow down here to live with Nan. He owned this house, so I was sure that was the only reason  
Nan had let Harlow live here. Kiro hadn‚Äôt given her an option. There was no guessing there.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here? Why?‚Äù Nan asked as she walked past me in nothing but a pair of panties that did nothing to cover her ass and a tiny tank top. Once, that had heated my blood. Her body would heat any man‚Äôs blood. But not anymore. I was over that. Sex with her was empty. So incredibly empty.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI was gonna get coffee before I left but I can leave without it,‚Äù I said, turning to head to the stairs.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can have some damn coffee if you want it. Then leave. I have things to do today,‚Äù she called out behind me.  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt staying here. I‚Äôd get Harlow alone, but not here. ‚ÄúNo thanks. You‚Äôre awake now. It‚Äôs time to leave,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† This was the last time. She thought I was a sex toy she could pull out and play with, and the fact was I had been. But I‚Äôd been closing my eyes and pretending like she was someone else. It never felt as good, but it helped me deal.  
  
¬† The guilt had been eating me alive. Leaving Harlow only hours after I had been with her to race home on Slacker Demon‚Äôs private jet and face the loss of a friend had broken me. Life was short. It had never been real to me before, but watching Jace lowered into the cold, hard ground had been a wake-up call. How long did we have? Seeing Bethy buckled over, sobbing at his loss, made me realize that kind of pain would be unbearable. She would have to live the rest of her life without him. That was scary as hell.  
  
¬† I had never loved anyone the way she had loved Jace. But I was close . . . I had been falling but then I stepped back. I couldn‚Äôt be that open. I couldn‚Äôt do that. What if I let myself be completely owned by Harlow? I knew now how easy it would be. She was the one for me. If I let her, she would be the one to own my soul. I couldn‚Äôt do it.  
  
¬† Each heart-wrenching sob that had torn from Bethy had been like a bucket of ice water poured over me. I had watched Rush as he held his wife, Blaire, in his arms, and she had cried silently against him. And I‚Äôd seen it there on his face. He had given his soul. He was thinking the same thing, but it was too late for him. ¬†He was vulnerable. If he lost her he wouldn‚Äôt be able to survive it. She would take every ounce of life in him with her. He couldn‚Äôt breathe without her. I‚Äôd left that day and drank until the idea of Harlow was numb. The sweet taste of her mouth was a blur, and the way she‚Äôd felt when I‚Äôd been inside her was a memory.  
  
¬† Harlow scared me. What I felt for her scared me. I had fought going back to her. I had been tormented with the memories of how her smile made my chest swell, and the way she made those innocent little sighs of pleasure. Then that night . . . that one incredible, mind-blowing night. I was afraid I would never be able to wash it away and move on. That was a power I had never allowed anyone to have over me. When Harlow didn‚Äôt respond to my calls and her dad warned me to stay away, I finally forced myself to push those memories to the back of my mind. Whiskey helped. When I didn‚Äôt have whiskey she was hard to forget. Even with whiskey, I remembered her‚Äîit just hurt less.  
  
¬† My need to see her had started to control me, and I had called Dean Finlay to get some help. He had told me that Kiro would have me arrested if I stepped foot on their property. He wasn‚Äôt happy with how I had used Harlow. Kiro believed I had slept with Harlow while I was still sleeping with Nan. I tried to explain and defend myself, but Dean had hung up on me.  
  
¬† So I‚Äôd drunk even more, because when I was sober the need for her returned. Before, I had done it to deal with Nan‚Äôs shit. But now I needed it more. I needed to forget what I‚Äôd done to someone so innocent and undeserving. I‚Äôd done this for two months. It helped me deal with the loss of Jace, and the taste of something I‚Äôd had but destroyed.  
  
¬† After all that . . . Kiro had sent Harlow here. To sit right under my nose without his security and protection. It was confusing as hell.  
  
¬† I reached Nan‚Äôs room and the sick feeling in my stomach returned. This felt dirty. Sex for fun had never felt dirty but this . . . it felt fucking disgusting. I hated myself. I grabbed my jeans and jerked them on and slipped my T-shirt over my head before grabbing my boots and shoving my feet into them.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt tell Nan bye. She didn‚Äôt care and I didn‚Äôt want to. I just got the hell away from there. I needed to get clean. I wanted to wash her off me. Then I was going to call Harlow. I had to find a way to explain. I just hoped she‚Äôd let me.  
  
¬† The sporty little black Audi sitting in the driveway right beside my truck had been a kick in the gut. Why hadn‚Äôt I noticed it last night? I should have known someone was here. Too much damn whiskey. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt notice.  
  
¬† Jerking the keys out of my pocket, I slammed my car door, furious with myself, and cranked the engine. I wouldn‚Äôt be drinking today. Or any damn day from here on out. I couldn‚Äôt do that anymore. I had to find a way to deal with Harlow being here, and get her to understand why I had backed away.  
  
¬† I just hoped she would understand. I didn‚Äôt want her to be hurt. But as much as I wanted her, the fear of being that vulnerable to one person was stronger. She had trusted me and I had betrayed her. I wouldn‚Äôt forgive myself for that.  
  
¬† I needed to talk to Rush. He was the only one I could talk to. We might not have been brothers by blood, but he was my brother. He had been since I was a kid. He was the only person in my life I‚Äôd ever let get that close. Not even my father truly knew me. He had never really tried. And my mom . . . she was a whole other story.  
  
¬† I called Rush‚Äôs number before pulling out of Nan‚Äôs driveway.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. The sound of a baby‚Äôs laughter came through on the other line.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need to talk. You keeping Nate today?‚Äù I asked. Rush spent more time with his son, Nate, than any dad I knew. I would say it was because he was making sure he gave his kid something neither he nor I‚Äôd had, but I knew better. He adored that kid. He adored his wife. Getting him away from them wasn‚Äôt easy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBlaire‚Äôs here. We were headed out to the beach, but if this is important you know she won‚Äôt mind me leaving for an hour or so.‚Äù He had picked up on the urgency in my voice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf she doesn‚Äôt mind. I really need to talk.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet me finish putting sunblock on the little man and help her get set up outside. Then I‚Äôll head over to your place.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm headed to the club. Meet me there. And thanks,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOnly for you,‚Äù he replied, and I understood. He didn‚Äôt make time for anyone outside of Nate and Blaire except for me. It was our bond.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTell Blaire thanks for me, too.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay. See you in a few.‚Äù  
  
¬† I hung up the phone and threw it over to the passenger‚Äôs seat and headed to the club.  
  
¬† Harlow  
  
¬† Finding the club was easy. Rosemary Beach was a small coastal town; it couldn‚Äôt even be called a city. It was where the elite lived and vacationed. After driving through it and seeing the houses up and down the gulf front, I understood why Nan wanted to live here.  
  
¬† Pulling up to the front gate of the club, I flashed my member‚Äôs pass that Daddy had given to me at the gatekeeper. He opened the large iron gates for me to enter and I followed the signs toward valet parking. I didn‚Äôt want to figure out where the parking lot was, and I could ask the valet how to get to the tennis courts.  
  
¬† A young guy in a white polo and white shorts walked toward my car when I pulled up to the valet. I reached into the backseat and grabbed my racquet before he opened my door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood morning, Miss,‚Äù he said with a friendly smile. His long blond hair fell over one eye and he tucked it back behind his ear. I imagined that he was a surfer. He looked like one.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I replied, pulling my bag over my shoulder. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm new here. Can you tell me where I can find the tennis courts?‚Äù  
  
¬† He nodded. ‚ÄúGo into the main entrance here. Take the first left and head to the double doors leading out onto the back veranda. Go down the stairs then take a right. You‚Äôll see the courts straight ahead.‚Äù  
  
¬† That sounded easy enough. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I replied, handing the young guy my keys.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan I see your card, Miss? I need to register your car into the system.‚Äù  
  
¬† I reached inside the car and got the card off my dashboard and handed it to him.  
  
¬† He quickly read it then ran it through a card reader before handing it back to me. ‚ÄúJust let us know when you‚Äôre ready for it, Miss Manning,‚Äù he replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù I thought about telling him he could call me Harlow but there was no point. He would probably get in trouble with management if he were ever caught calling me by my first name.  
  
¬† I headed inside. The fact that I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to run into Nan here was the most relief I‚Äôd had all morning. A man dressed like the guy outside opened the door for me, and I followed the valet‚Äôs directions to the tennis courts.  
  
¬† I passed a restaurant on my way and decided I would come back for lunch. It looked nice and the food smelled amazing from out here. A girl in white shorts and a white polo stopped in front of me. A slow smile touched her face. Her brown hair was pulled up high in a ponytail, and it was obvious she was an employee‚Äîher outfit was the same as those of the men who‚Äôd helped me, only more fitted. But she looked familiar.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHarlow?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† I recognized her. I had met her at Rush and Blaire‚Äôs wedding. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I replied, frustrated because I couldn‚Äôt remember her name. Grant had messed with my head that day and I couldn‚Äôt remember much more than my conversation with him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Bethy. Blaire‚Äôs friend. We met at the wedding,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† I felt my face heat up. I hated not remembering people. It was part of my socially inept thing. ‚ÄúI remember,‚Äù I replied with a smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to see you again.‚Äù I hoped that was the correct thing to say and that I didn‚Äôt sound like an idiot, because I sure felt like one.  
  
¬† Bethy‚Äôs expression was friendly, but there was a sadness in her eyes. ‚ÄúI understand. You met a lot of people that day. I didn‚Äôt know you were in town.‚Äù  
  
¬† I liked this girl. She was making me feel comfortable. That was rare. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here while my dad‚Äôs on tour. He sent me to  
live with Nan.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy‚Äôs eyes went wide and she let out a low whistle. ‚ÄúDamn. I thought you were the daughter he liked.‚Äù  
  
¬† She obviously was very close to Blaire and knew exactly what our family situation was like. ‚ÄúHe bought Nan the house here, but in return I get to live in it, too, when he‚Äôs on tour. He doesn‚Äôt like leaving me alone in L.A.,‚Äù I explained, trying not to sound too defensive about Dad.  
  
¬† Bethy let out a long sigh. ‚ÄúPersonally, I‚Äôd brave L.A. if I were you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I felt like laughing but I didn‚Äôt. I bit my lip to keep it in.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm right. The bitch hates you,‚Äù Bethy said. ‚ÄúShe hates Blaire, too, so the two of you should team up and join forces.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI really like Blaire. I‚Äôm so glad Rush found her.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy studied me a moment. ‚ÄúI guess you and Rush have a lot in common. You two were practically raised by Slacker Demon.‚Äù  
  
¬† There was also my brother Mase. No one ever mentioned him. He lived with his mother on a ranch in Texas. Dad had gone to see him several times that I knew of, but he rarely came to L.A. He liked his life in Texas. He was also very close to his stepfather. ‚ÄúYeah. We‚Äôve seen a lot,‚Äù I replied, deciding not to mention Mase. That would only lead to questions I wasn‚Äôt sure how to answer. Dad hadn‚Äôt seen Mase in over a year but Mase called me at least once a month to check in with me and see how I was. It gave me a chance to ask him about his life. My grandmama used to make sure I saw Mase several times a year. I hadn‚Äôt seen him since she passed away. I never told Dad about it because I worried that he would be hurt that Mase didn‚Äôt reach out to him that way.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre in Rosemary, although I wish you had better accommodations. You need help finding anything around here?‚Äù she asked, then looked down at my tennis skirt and the racquet over my arm and smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre headed to the tennis courts. Follow me. I need to make sure you don‚Äôt get molested by Nelton, our sleazy tennis pro. We have a much nicer pro, Adam. That‚Äôs who you need.‚Äù  
  
¬† Good to know. Stay away from Nelton. She spun around and we headed toward the doors. Her ponytail swished back and forth as she went, but there was no bounce to her step. Even though I didn‚Äôt know her very well, that seemed odd.  
  
¬† We headed out the door and she waved at several people. Most of them members. It was interesting that she was on friendly terms with members yet she worked here. I wasn‚Äôt used to that sort of country club. I liked it. Very much.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you play tennis a lot?‚Äù Bethy asked, glancing back at me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAt Dad‚Äôs place they have a court. I use it for exercise and just to have something to do. Gives me time to think.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd here you‚Äôre going to use it to get away from Nan. Good idea,‚Äù Bethy replied.  
  
¬† This time I did smile.  
  
¬† A tall, blond man with a dark tan and green eyes saw us walking his way and his eyes began to travel down my body. I didn‚Äôt like it at all. The visor he was wearing was turned around backward and he was dressed in an all-white tennis outfit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot for you, Nelton. Stick to your cougars. I‚Äôm looking for Adam,‚Äù Bethy told the man, and I found myself moving closer to her as we passed him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you let her decide who she wants? I got a free hour for that one,‚Äù he replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYuck, ew, go away,‚Äù Bethy snapped, and kept walking.  
  
¬† I was really thankful for Bethy right then.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry. Nelton thinks he‚Äôs God‚Äôs gift to women. If he weren‚Äôt so creepy he‚Äôd be attractive but he‚Äôs just . . . ugh. The older women love him, though. Adam is new. Woods, the owner of Kerrington Club, hired Adam two weeks ago‚Äîor maybe I should say Della, Woods‚Äôs fianc√©e, hired Adam two weeks ago. She wasn‚Äôt a fan of Nelton and wanted another option out here.‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt know Della but I liked her for that reason alone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAdam,‚Äù Bethy called out, and I looked out on the court to see a tall, muscular man turn around. His hair was red. Maybe more of a strawberry blond from being out in the sun so much. He had a white sweatband around his head, and he was also wearing the white tennis outfit that Nelton had been wearing. I noticed the words ‚ÄúKerrington Club‚Äù stitched on his shirt in small, scripted letters and ‚ÄúTennis Pro‚Äù under it.  
  
¬† Adam came jogging over to us with a smile on his face. As he got closer, his clear blue eyes came into focus. They were startling and very pale. He wasn‚Äôt as tan as Nelson‚Äîhe was more on the fair side. He even had freckles on his muscular arms. He would be what my grandmama called a ginger.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, Bethy, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù he asked, smiling at Bethy and glancing over at me with a grin then back to Bethy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have a new member. She‚Äôs a friend of Rush‚Äôs and, unfortunately, Nan‚Äôs half-sister. We won‚Äôt hold that against her. Like Rush, she‚Äôs nothing like Nan. Anyway, she wants to play. Set her up and schedule her; she‚Äôs gonna need some place to escape while she‚Äôs living with the wicked bitch. Anyway, Harlow, this is Adam. Adam, meet Harlow.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy really hated Nan.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNice to meet you, Harlow,‚Äù he said, holding out his hand. I slipped mine in his and shook it. It was brief. Nothing awkward or uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt like shaking hands or touching people I had just met.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have a couple of openings in my schedule I need to fill. Nelton stays pretty booked and he gets most of the regulars,‚Äù Adam informed us. His teeth were perfectly straight and very white. I had a thing for pretty teeth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay then. My job is done,‚Äù Bethy said, then turned to me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe with Adam. He‚Äôs not a creeper. Enjoy your day.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you for your help,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† Bethy flashed a smile, but again the sadness in her eyes was there. ‚ÄúNo problem. Blaire has sung your praises. I wanted to make sure I took care of you for her.‚Äù  
  
¬† I nodded and Bethy waved back at Adam before heading back to where we came from.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we look at my schedule over here on the Mac and set up your daily sessions? That is, if you‚Äôre coming every day.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes. I‚Äôm going to need something to do,‚Äù I assured him. Adam was easy to be around, and the idea of having something to look forward to and someone to talk to, even if it was about tennis, sounded appealing. Besides, he was attractive and his smile made his eyes twinkle. I liked that. I liked it a lot.  
  
¬† Grant  
  
¬† Harlow wasn‚Äôt answering my calls, dammit. Just like before. She was shutting me out. The look on her face this morning had been so painful. She hadn‚Äôt answered my calls and she believed I had been fucking Nan all along. It was why she was shutting me out . . . right? I had caved and started sleeping with Nan again when I realized Harlow wasn‚Äôt letting me into her stone fortress. I had tried to wipe her from my mind. It hadn‚Äôt worked. But I was fucking trying. The hurt, betrayed look in her eyes was eating me alive. What was she thinking? Had I gotten all this wrong?  
  
¬† I needed to talk to her.  
  
¬† I stalked into the club and almost ran over Bethy. I hadn‚Äôt seen much of her over the past few months. She‚Äôd stayed to herself and kept busy with work.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said as she stopped and looked up at me with a forced smile.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi‚Äù was her only response.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù It was an empty question but I didn‚Äôt know what else to say. Out of all of us, she‚Äôd suffered the loss of Jace the most.  
  
¬† She shrugged. ‚ÄúHeaded to work. Just got Harlow signed up with Adam, the new tennis pro, so now my good deed for the day is done.‚Äù  
  
¬† Harlow.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHarlow‚Äôs on the tennis courts?‚Äù I asked, trying not to take off running in that direction.  
  
¬† Bethy nodded. ‚ÄúYep. Hiding from Nan for the day. I feel sorry for the poor girl. But then you wouldn‚Äôt understand anyone‚Äôs dislike of Nan,‚Äù she replied and rolled her eyes before stepping around me and walking out the door.  
  
¬† I wanted to defend myself but I was too focused on getting to Harlow.  
  
¬† When I stepped onto the brick sidewalk toward the courts, I noticed Nelton with Thad‚Äôs mother. I was pretty sure Thad‚Äôs mom was  
n‚Äôt one of Nelton‚Äôs groupies. She was a nice lady. I couldn‚Äôt imagine her sleeping around on her husband. Besides, she wouldn‚Äôt do anything to let Thad down. The boy was spoiled and lucky as hell.  
  
¬† I walked past them and my gaze immediately singled out Harlow. She had a pinched, determined frown on her face as she hit every ball Adam sent her way. She also looked like a fucking dream in that skirt.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, girl,‚Äù Adam called out in appreciation. I didn‚Äôt like his tone of voice. He seemed too happy for her. Too . . . interested.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna take it up a notch. Think you can handle it?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBring it on.‚Äù She stopped when her eyes found me. I could see the series of emotions before she closed them off and turned her eyes back toward Adam. ‚ÄúGive me a minute.‚Äù  
  
¬† Adam had turned and was looking my way. I could feel his gaze on me but I wasn‚Äôt taking my eyes off her in case she got away.  
  
¬† She reached for her towel and wiped the sweat from her face and neck then grabbed her water bottle and took a long swig. I waited patiently, enjoying the way she moved. I had never seen anyone quite as poised as Harlow. She had this graceful, polished way of doing things. Even when she was out here sweating, she reminded me of some sort of royalty.  
  
¬† Her shoulders lifted and fell as she took a deep breath, then she turned to walk toward me. There was a determined gleam in her eyes. It did nothing to deter me. If anything, I wanted to grab her and kiss her until we both forgot the past two months.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you need?‚Äù she asked, keeping a good foot of distance between us. The uptight, cold, sexy-as-hell tone to her voice was one I was familiar with. This had been the Harlow before I‚Äôd brought her Chinese food and convinced her to trust me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe need to talk. There‚Äôs a lot I need to explain,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† Harlow cocked an eyebrow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not deaf or blind. No need to explain. I understand completely.‚Äù  
  
¬† Dammit. ‚ÄúHarlow, last night is not what you think. You wouldn‚Äôt talk to me. I called and you shut me out. What was I supposed to do? I was . . . Hell, I‚Äôve been trying to forget you. To forget us. Because that‚Äôs what you were forcing me to do. And last night I was so fucking trashed I didn‚Äôt know my name.‚Äù

I had an old-school Gaggia Syncrony Logic that we had been given in 2006 or 2007.  Worked great for many years.  Unfortunately, in late 2023 the brew group broke when a screw rusted through and snapped irreparably.  I bought a new brew group that was for a later model but back-compatible.  Since then the machine worked, but would leak slightly from the bottom when brewing -- coffee tasted fine, there was no water leakage when idle, no damage, and I couldn't find any obvious source for the runoff.  Anyway, after a year or so, I moved back to the midwest and contacted a professional repair shop I'd used to clean and tune it professionally before.  They advised me it might be tough to get parts and they recommended I just buy a new machine.  Being a simple man of simple tastes (and most pertinently, simple budget) I bought the DeLonghi Magnifica Start and have been pleased with it.

However, I still have the Gaggia.  I'm sure that someone with greater mechanical skill than I could get access and maybe it's just an O-ring or a seal that needs tightening, in which case problem solved.  Obviously, if it's more than that, could be junk.  The parts still work though.  Would anyone in this community be interested in discussing a purchase?",1,1749303507.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Nannette had been my go-to fuck for years, but then she‚Äôd gotten needy. And I‚Äôd liked it. Somehow, she had managed to get under my skin. I had wanted to be wanted‚ÄîI was that pathetic. My dad rarely called me; my mom had decided she preferred French models over me years ago. I was screwed the hell up. It was time I let this go. Nan had needed me for a time when she felt like she was losing Rush, her brother and safe place, to his new life with his wife and child. Not that Rush wouldn‚Äôt welcome her with open arms‚Äîit was just that she was such a bitch. All she had to do was accept Rush‚Äôs wife, Blaire. That was it. But the stubborn woman wouldn‚Äôt do it.  
 Mine had been the arms she‚Äôd run into, and like a fool I had opened them up for her. Now, all I had was a lot of damn drama and a slightly damaged heart. She hadn‚Äôt claimed it. Not completely. But she had touched a place no one else had. She had needed me. No one had ever needed me. It had made me weak. To prove my point, here I sat in Nan‚Äôs father‚Äôs home, looking for her, waiting on her. She was running wild again, and Rush wasn‚Äôt coming to the rescue. He had hung up his Superman cape and decided his days of coming to Nan‚Äôs side were over. I had wanted that. As sick as it was, I had wanted to be her hero. Damn, I was a pussy. Drink, kid. Fuck knows you need it,‚Äù Kiro, Nan‚Äôs father, said as he shoved a half-empty bottle of tequila into my hands. Kiro was the lead singer of the most legendary rock band in the world. Slacker Demon had been around for twenty years, and their songs still skyrocketed to number one whenever they released a new album.¬† I started to argue but changed my mind. He was right. I needed a drink. I didn‚Äôt think about where the dude‚Äôs mouth had been when I touched the rim of the bottle to my lips and tipped it back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a smart boy, Grant. What I can‚Äôt figure is why the hell you‚Äôre putting up with Nan‚Äôs shit,‚Äù Kiro said as he sank down onto the white leather sofa across from me. He was in a pair of black skinny jeans and a silver shirt, unbuttoned and hanging open. Tattoos covered his chest and arms. Women still went crazy over him. It wasn‚Äôt his looks. He was too damn skinny. A diet of alcohol and drugs would do that to you. But he was Kiro. That was all that mattered to them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou gonna ignore me? Hell, she‚Äôs my daughter and I can‚Äôt put up with her. Damn crazy bitch, just like her momma,‚Äù he drawled before taking a pull off a joint.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough, Daddy.‚Äù The musical voice that was finding its way into my fantasies lately came from the doorway.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs my baby girl. She‚Äôs come out of her room to visit,‚Äù Kiro said, grinning at the daughter he actually loved. The one he hadn‚Äôt abandoned. Harlow Manning was breathtaking. She didn‚Äôt look like a rock star‚Äôs kid. She looked like an innocent, sweet country girl, with long, dark hair and eyes that made you forget your fucking name.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI was going to see if you planned on eating dinner at home tonight or if you were going out,‚Äù she said. I watched as she stepped into the room and purposely ignored me. That only made me smile.  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt like me. I had met her at Rush and Blaire‚Äôs engagement party and then spoken to her at their wedding reception. Both times hadn‚Äôt ended well.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI was thinkin‚Äô of going out. I need to party a little. I‚Äôve stayed inside this house too damn long.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh. Okay,‚Äù she said in that soft voice that I swear was intoxicating.  
  
¬† Kiro frowned. ‚ÄúYou lonely? Locking yourself away in that room with your books getting to you, baby girl?‚Äù  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off Harlow. She rarely came around when I was here. Nan wasn‚Äôt exactly kind to her. I got why she didn‚Äôt like Harlow. She was eaten up with jealousy where Harlow was concerned. Even if it wasn‚Äôt Harlow‚Äôs fault that Kiro loved her and didn‚Äôt seem to give a shit about Nan. Harlow lit up a room when she walked into it. There was a peacefulness about her that was hard to explain. It made you want to get close to her and see if you could soak it in. She made it easy for someone as selfish as Kiro to love her. Nan made it hard for normal people to love her‚Äîmuch less someone like Kiro Manning.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm fine. I was just going to wait and eat with you if you planned to eat here. If not, I‚Äôll just eat a sandwich in my room.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kiro started shaking his head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like that. You‚Äôre in there too much. I want you to stop reading for tonight. Grant is here and he needs some company. He‚Äôs a good guy. Talk to him. You can have dinner together while he waits for Nan to return.‚Äù  
  
¬† Harlow stiffened and finally glanced my way, but only for a moment. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on, don‚Äôt be a snob. Grant‚Äôs a family friend. He‚Äôs Rush‚Äôs brother. Have dinner with him.‚Äù  
  
¬† Harlow‚Äôs spine stiffened even straighter. She went back to not making eye contact with me. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not Rush‚Äôs brother. If he were, it would be even more disgusting that he‚Äôs sleeping with Nan.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kiro grinned like Harlow was the funniest person in the world and he was proud of her spunk. ‚ÄúMy kitten has claws, and apparently only you bring them out. Sleeping with the evil sister has put you on my baby girl‚Äôs shit list. Now that‚Äôs funny as hell.‚Äù He looked extremely amused as he took another long draw from his joint.  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt amused. I didn‚Äôt like the fact Harlow hated me. I wasn‚Äôt sure how the hell to fix it, though. Turning my back on Nan wasn‚Äôt possible. She wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle someone else dropping her. Even if her slutty ass deserved it. I wouldn‚Äôt let myself think about the boy band she was currently sleeping with. Guess I was wrong about those guys. I thought for sure they were sleeping with each other. Instead, they were all sleeping with Nan.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHave a good night, Daddy,‚Äù Harlow said, then turned and walked out of the room before Kiro could demand she stay with me.  
  
¬† Kiro laid his head back and closed his eyes. ‚ÄúShame she hates you. She‚Äôs special. Only known one other like her, and it was her mom. Woman stole my heart. I adored her. Worshipped the fucking ground she walked on. I would have thrown all this shit away for her. I had planned on it. I just wanted to wake up each morning and see her there beside me. I wanted to watch her with our baby girl and know that they were mine. But God wanted her more. Took her the fuck away from me. I won‚Äôt ever get over it. Never.‚Äù  
  
¬† This wasn‚Äôt the first time I had heard him ramble on about Harlow‚Äôs mother. He did it whenever he got high. She was the first thing that came to his mind. I hadn‚Äôt known that kind of love. Scared the shit out of me, though. I wasn‚Äôt sure I ever wanted to know it. Kiro had never recovered. I had met the man when I was a kid and my dad had married Rush‚Äôs mom. Rush had begged his dad, Dean Finlay, the drummer for Slacker Demon, to take me with them on one of his weekend visits.  
  
¬† I had been in awe. It had been the first of many weekends. And Kiro would always talk about ‚Äúher‚Äù and curse God for taking her. It had fascinated me, even as a child. I had never witnessed that kind of devotion.  
  
¬† Even after my dad‚Äôs short marriage to Rush‚Äôs mother, Georgianna, I had remained close to Rush. His dad still came to pick me up sometimes when he got Rush. I had grown up personally knowing the most legendary rock band in the world.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNan hates her. Who the hell can hate Harlow? She‚Äôs too damn sweet to hate. Girl hasn‚Äôt done anything to Nan, yet Nan‚Äôs mean as a goddamn snake. Poor Harlow stays away from her. I hate to see my baby girl so defenseless. She needs to toughen up. She needs a friend.‚Äù Kiro set his joint down in an ashtray and turned his head to look at me. ‚ÄúBe her friend, kid. She needs one.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wanted to be a lot more than Harlow Manning‚Äôs friend. But she wouldn‚Äôt even look a  
t me. I had tried more than once to direct one of those earth-shattering smiles my way, but she hardly glanced at me. Prove me nuts. ‚ÄúNot sure I can be her friend and Nan‚Äôs at the same time.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kiro frowned, then sat up and leaned forward. ‚ÄúThree kinds of women in this world. The kind that suck you dry and leave you with nothing. The kind that only want a good time. And the kind that make life worth a damn. That last kind . . . the right woman‚Äôs the one who gives as much as she takes, and you can‚Äôt get enough. She‚Äôs the kind . . . if you lose her, you lose yourself.‚Äù  
  
¬† His bloodshot eyes told me he hadn‚Äôt just smoked a joint today. But even high, he made sense. If anyone knew about women, it was Kiro Manning.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had all three. Wish like hell I‚Äôd stayed away from the first. The second is all I touch anymore. But that third one . . . I won‚Äôt ever be the same. And I wouldn‚Äôt take back one minute I had with Harlow‚Äôs mom.‚Äù  
  
¬† He ran his hand through his stringy hair. ‚ÄúNannette, she‚Äôs the first kind. Be careful of the first kind. They will fuck you over and walk away laughing.‚Äù  
  
¬† Harlow  
  
¬† Three months later . . .  
  
¬† Only nine months. Just nine months. I could make it nine months. I would hide in my room and only come out when she wasn‚Äôt here. Classes would start soon and I would have my courses to distract me. Then Dad would be home and I‚Äôd leave this place behind me. I could do it. I had to. Dad hadn‚Äôt given me any other option.  
  
¬† The house was quiet. The loud sounds of Nan having sex with some idiot had woken me up around two this morning. I had put on my Beats and cranked up my favorite playlist. At some point I had fallen back to sleep. Because the music had been pumping in my ears when I woke up this morning, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was home alone or not. It was after ten and the house was so quiet, I was pretty sure no one was here. Besides, Nan didn‚Äôt seem like the kind to have a sleepover this late.  
  
¬† She screwed them then tossed them.  
  
¬† I threw back the covers and ran my hands through my hair to tame the tangles before stepping into the hallway. Silence was all that met my ears. I was safe. I could eat. Nan hadn‚Äôt been here when I arrived last night, but I knew she must have noticed my car outside. Dad had an Audi waiting on me when I had landed at the airport.  
  
¬† After finding the house, I had gone to buy some groceries, then unloaded my food and luggage. Dad had bought this house for Nan with the understanding that I would stay with her for nine months while he was on tour with Slacker Demon. She wanted a house in Rosemary Beach, Florida. He had supplied a big one. Dad did everything big. Which was good for me. I could hide from her more easily. Unfortunately, there was only one kitchen.  
  
¬† I walked down the hallway and headed down the winding staircase, which spiraled past the top two floors before ending at the bottom floor. My bare feet made very little noise as I walked across the hardwood planks. I had just opened the fridge to get my organic milk when a door opened and closed somewhere in the house.  
  
¬† I froze and considered shoving the milk back in the fridge and hiding. I wasn‚Äôt ready to face Nan yet. I needed coffee before I dealt with her. The heavy footsteps on the stairs weren‚Äôt Nan‚Äôs. Which made me even more nervous. Facing some strange man wasn‚Äôt appealing, either. I wasn‚Äôt dressed. I still had on my pajamas. Pink satin polka-dotted shorts and a matching tank top were all I had on. I glanced around for a hiding place, but before I could figure out what to do the footsteps landed on the bottom floor.  
  
¬† I was stuck . . . unless I hid behind the counter while he escaped. Maybe he wouldn‚Äôt come this way. The front door was past the kitchen, but the back door was just as close to the stairs. I set my milk carton on the copper countertop and waited. The footsteps weren‚Äôt heavy anymore. I barely heard them. Straining my ears, I tried to figure out where they were going.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt until it was too late to hide that I realized he was barefoot and headed my way. My eyes locked with Grant‚Äôs as he stepped into the kitchen wearing nothing but a pair of black boxer briefs. He stopped when his eyes met mine. We stood there silently, staring at each other. The realization that he was the one who had woken me last night made my stomach knot up. I didn‚Äôt want to think about him in bed with Nan.  
  
¬† But the realization doused me like a bucket of cold water. Grant was still sleeping with Nan. All that stuff he‚Äôd said to me was a lie. He had made me a promise, one I hadn‚Äôt asked for and he had never intended to keep.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHarlow?‚Äù he said, his voice thick from sleep. He‚Äôd been up most of the night. He must‚Äôve been exhausted.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt respond. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to say. I hadn‚Äôt expected him to even be in Rosemary Beach. But he was here . . . and he was sleeping in Nan‚Äôs bed.  
  
¬† I was an idiot.  
  
¬† Three months ago . . .  
  
¬† A knock on my bedroom door interrupted my favorite scene in a book I had read at least ten times. Annoyed, I laid down my Kindle. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù  
  
¬† The door opened slowly and Grant Carter stuck his ridiculously beautiful head into my room. His long hair, which curled at the ends and tucked neatly behind his ears, made a girl want to sit and just play with it for hours. I often wondered if it was as soft as it looked. His eyes twinkled as if he knew exactly what I was thinking, so I forced a scowl on my face. I never scowled, so it was a new thing that I reserved just for him.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt really fair. I disliked him on principle. He had been nothing but nice to me, but the fact he was in a relationship with Nan was enough for me to not like him. If a guy could like Nan then something was wrong with him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI ordered Chinese. Want to help me eat it? I got way too much.‚Äù His blue eyes were so hard to look away from. They had been my downfall since the first time I laid eyes on him. That had been before I knew he was Nan‚Äôs Grant.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hungry,‚Äù I replied, hoping my stomach didn‚Äôt growl and give me away. I had been meaning to fix myself something to eat, but the book had sucked me in. Seeing Grant always made me want to escape into one of my stories where guys who looked like him fell in love with girls like me. Not girls like Nan.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you,‚Äù he said, pushing my door open and walking into the room with a tray covered in boxes from the little Chinatown place my dad loved so much. ‚ÄúHelp me eat. Just because I dated Nan doesn‚Äôt make me tainted. You act like I‚Äôve got a damn disease‚Äîand I‚Äôll be honest, it hurts my feelings.‚Äù  
  
¬† Really? Was I hurting his feelings? I hadn‚Äôt meant to. I didn‚Äôt think he would really care. Besides, he was the one who ran off cursing the night we met when he found out who I was after he had made a move on me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDated?‚Äù I asked, surprised with myself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here waiting on her to show up. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs past tense.‚Äù I sounded like a schoolteacher.  
  
¬† Grant chuckled and sat down beside me on the bed and set the tray down on the bedside table. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my friend. I‚Äôm checking in on her. Not dating her. Besides, I just got word that she‚Äôs back in Rosemary.‚Äù  
  
¬† See, that. Just that. He was her friend. What normal person was Nan‚Äôs friend? None I knew of. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs sleeping with the members of Naked Marathon. Surely you‚Äôve seen her in the gossip magazines on Sellers‚Äôs arm. Last week she made the news with Moon, and there was all kinds of talk about her breaking up the band. Which isn‚Äôt going to happen.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant opened a carton of sweet-and-sour chicken and stuck a pair of chopsticks in it, then handed it to me. ‚ÄúSweet- and-sour or honey chicken? You pick.‚Äù  
  
¬† I took the sweet-and-sour. ‚ÄúThis is fine. Thank you,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† His smile grew. He hadn‚Äôt expected me to take it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood, I wanted the honey,‚Äù he replied with a wink. I hated that my stomach fluttered. I didn‚Äôt need that to start happening. Grant was on the other side of a line that I wasn‚Äôt going to cross.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt my business who Nan is screwing. That‚Äôs over between us. I‚Äôm just checking in on her. Making sure she‚Äôs not about to go off the grid again. She‚Äôs home now, so it‚Äôs all good.‚Äù  
  
¬† Why would he do that? What had she done  
to earn that kind of protectiveness from someone like Grant? ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice of you,‚Äù I said because I didn‚Äôt know what else to say. I took a bite of my chicken.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna hold that against me, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù he asked, studying me in a way that only made me want to squirm.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can protect who you want, Grant. We‚Äôre just sharing some Chinese food. Doesn‚Äôt matter what I think.‚Äù I replied before putting more chicken in my mouth.  
  
¬† Grant frowned and then a small smile touched his lips. ‚ÄúI feel like we‚Äôre doing this crazy-ass dance around each other every time I get around you. I don‚Äôt play games. It ain‚Äôt my thing, sugar. So let me be blunt,‚Äù he said, setting his food back down on the table and turning his body so that he faced me completely. I tried to calm my racing heart. What was he doing? What was I going to do if he got any closer? Guys didn‚Äôt flirt with me. They didn‚Äôt come into my room. I was Kiro‚Äôs weird, awkward daughter. Didn‚Äôt Grant get that?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to hate me,‚Äù he said, simply.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt hate him. I shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, you do. I‚Äôm not used to people hating me. Especially beautiful girls,‚Äù he said and flashed me a wicked grin.  
  
¬† He had called me beautiful. Did he really think that? Or was he feeling sorry for me because I was so socially inept?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHarlow, do you realize that you‚Äôre breathtaking? Just looking at you can become addictive.‚Äù  
  
¬† Wow.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat confused, flustered look on your face is all the answer I need. You don‚Äôt have a clue how amazing you are. That‚Äôs a shame,‚Äù he said, reaching over and taking a strand of my hair and wrapping it around his finger. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a real shame.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt sure that I was breathing. My entire body had shut down. I couldn‚Äôt move. Grant was touching me. And even though it was my hair, it felt so nice. I dropped my gaze to his hand and watched as his thumb gently ran over the hair he was holding.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like silk,‚Äù he said in a hushed voice. Like he didn‚Äôt want anyone to hear him.

¬†I just watched him. What was I supposed to say to him?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHarlow,‚Äù he said, leaning closer to me. I could feel his warm breath on my skin.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I choked out, watching him closely as he moved toward me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think about you. I dream about you,‚Äù he said in a husky whisper against my ear. I shivered and felt my grip on my chicken loosen. God, please don‚Äôt let me dump my food on myself.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too sweet for me, but damned if I care,‚Äù he said, then pressed a kiss to the skin under my ear. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to hate me. I want you to forgive me for being with Nan. It‚Äôs over.‚Äù  
  
¬† The reminder of Nan was enough to snap me out of my trance, and I jumped up from the bed and walked across the room to stand far enough away that I felt safe.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt look back at Grant. I kept my back to him and stared out the window. Maybe he would just leave. I felt my face grow hot. I had let him get so close. I had let him kiss my neck. What was I thinking?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have said her name,‚Äù he said in a defeated tone. He was perceptive. ‚ÄúWill you tell me what I can do to prove to you that I don‚Äôt want Nan? That she was a moment of insanity and weakness? I was being a guy and she was there. I made a mistake.‚Äù  
  
¬† He wanted me to forgive him about as much as I wanted to be able to forget Nan. I liked Grant. No . . . I fantasized about Grant. Since he‚Äôd cornered me at Rush and Blaire‚Äôs wedding reception he had made it into my nightly fantasies. Even if he was someone I was afraid to trust. I liked looking at him. I liked hearing his voice. I liked the way he smelled and the sound of his laugh. The way his mouth curled up on one side when he was amused. I also liked the tattoos I saw peeking out of the collar of his shirt. I wanted to know what they looked like.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan I have a chance? One to prove I‚Äôm not like Nan. I‚Äôm a pretty damn good friend. I just need you to give me a break.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was typically a forgiving person. My grandmother had taught me to forgive. She had raised me to be a kind person and reminded me that everyone deserved a second chance. One day I might need a second chance myself.  
  
¬† I turned around and looked at Grant. He was still sitting on my bed. The dark blue T-shirt he was wearing fit his arms tightly and outlined the ripples on his chest. It also highlighted the color of his eyes. How was someone supposed to not trust him? ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to be your friend,‚Äù I said. I wasn‚Äôt sure what else to say.  
  
¬† That crooked grin appeared. ‚ÄúYou would? You‚Äôre going to forgive me?‚Äù  
  
¬† I nodded and made myself take a step back toward the bed. ‚ÄúYes. But don‚Äôt . . . don‚Äôt . . . do that again.‚Äù I said, reaching up and touching the skin that still tingled from his lips.  
  
¬† Grant let out a defeated sigh and nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs gonna be hard, but I won‚Äôt. Not until you ask me.‚Äù He stopped and patted the spot where I had been sitting. I walked over and sat back down. Grant leaned forward. ‚ÄúBut Harlow,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† His sexy male scent made me want to inhale deeply. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I asked, hoping he wasn‚Äôt about to touch me again. I seemed to forget myself when he did.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou will ask me,‚Äù he replied.  
  
¬† I opened my mouth to argue, but before I could he stuck a piece of honey chicken in my mouth. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say it. I‚Äôll just get to say I told you so when you ask me. And I really hate to gloat. Especially to a girl I want to make smile, not slap me.‚Äù  
  
¬† I managed to chew the chicken before the laughter bubbled up and escaped. He really was adorable. What he didn‚Äôt realize was I could never give in. It wasn‚Äôt fair to him. He didn‚Äôt know the truth and I didn‚Äôt want him to know. It changed how people looked at me. I couldn‚Äôt stand the idea of Grant looking at me the way others had.  
  
¬† Grant  
  
¬† Present day  
  
¬† I hadn‚Äôt seen her since the night I got the call about Jace. The night I‚Äôd . . . the night I‚Äôd taken her virginity. She‚Äôd been a virgin. I hadn‚Äôt expected that. It had been a first for me, too. I had never slept with a virgin before. Something about it affected me deeper than I was comfortable with. Even though I knew I wasn‚Äôt ready for commitment in any form, I had wanted to stake a claim. I often wondered if that would have sent me running the next day, even if I hadn‚Äôt gotten the call from Tripp.  
  
¬† And finally, here she was. No longer kept from me by her father, or whoever else had made sure I didn‚Äôt get near her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLast night. It was you,‚Äù she said, simply.  
  
¬† I took in her pajamas and felt like cursing and slamming my fist through the wall. I wasn‚Äôt a violent guy. I never lost my cool, but right now I was close to it. Harlow was here. She‚Äôd heard me and Nan. Holy hell!  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt called. I didn‚Äôt realize.‚Äù She stopped talking and shook her head. I couldn‚Äôt find the right words. There weren‚Äôt any. I had no explanation for this that she would understand. I watched as she put the milk back in the fridge and closed the door. She kept her head down and didn‚Äôt look up again before walking around the counter and toward the door. I had to say something. I had to explain myself. I had fucking called. They never let me talk to her when I called the house. She never answered my damn calls when I called her phone. But, fuck, she didn‚Äôt deserve this. Not when she‚Äôd trusted me with something as precious as her innocence.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs me who gets to say I told you so this time,‚Äù she said in a quiet voice before walking past me. The weight on my chest felt like someone had set a thousand bricks on it. I clenched my hands into fists and closed my eyes. What had I done? And why? Why was I letting Nan fuck up my life?  
  
¬† Why the hell had I drunk so much damn whiskey last night? I would have never come here had I been sober. And Harlow . . . Harlow . . . why was Harlow here? I turned and looked back toward the staircase. A door clicked closed. There was no slamming or yelling with Harlow. She wasn‚Äôt that way. Any other woman would have cursed me and possibly slapped me then stormed up the stairs and slammed her door. But not Harlow. That made this even worse. If that was possible.  
  
¬† Two months and three and a half weeks ago . . .  
  
¬† Harlow stepped out of the house, looking unsure of herself. It had taken me twenty minutes to convince her to swim with me. She had made up all kinds of excuses. But I was pretty damn persuasive when I wanted to be. The oversized Slacker Demon concert T-shirt she was wearing covered up whatever swimsuit she‚Äôd finally put on. I had been waiting on her for half an hour. I was almost ready to go up to her room and pull her out here myself. I had just gotten back to L.A. a few hours ago. Being in Rosemary was hard when all I could think about was Harlow‚Äôs sweet smile. I was anxious to be near her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAbout time. I thought you were gonna make me swim alone,‚Äù I said, standing up from the lounger I had been reclining on while waiting.  
  
¬† Harlow blushed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry it took me so long.‚Äù  
  
¬† As if she needed to apologize. There was no way a man could be even remotely annoyed with her. It was impossible. She was too damn sweet and innocently sexy, which was screwing with my head. There was no way she was that innocent. She was in college. She had to have dated before. In high school the guys would have been all over her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here now. Let‚Äôs swim. It‚Äôs warm out here today.‚Äù  
  
¬† Harlow reached for the hem of her shirt and I considered diving in and not watching her take it off. It would be the polite thing to do, but hell if I could convince my eyes that looking away was the best idea. They were zoned in on her every move.  
  
¬† We had been . . . I wasn‚Äôt sure what we had been doing. This was the strangest relationship‚Äîif you could call it that‚ÄîI had ever been in. Harlow was letting me get closer every day but she still kept up her barriers. I hadn‚Äôt managed to get my lips near her skin again.  
  
¬† My eyes drank in her long legs as the T-shirt slowly lifted, revealing a simple high-necked one-piece white bathing suit. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôd seen a girl my age in a one-piece swimsuit. But it was white. Holy fuck. I felt myself harden as my eyes traveled up from her legs to the nipple I could clearly see pebbled beneath the fabric.  
  
¬† I  
turned and dove into the water before I scared the hell out of her. I swam the length of the pool before coming up for air and turning to look at her. She was walking down into the pool through the sloping entrance. Damn, she was perfect. She lifted her eyes and smiled at me. It was a good thing my reaction to her was hidden under the water.  
  
¬† Once she was far enough in that the water touched her shoulders, she seemed to relax. Having her body on display made her nervous. It had been all over her face. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why. It was like throwing me a challenge. I wanted her body completely on display for me. And I wanted her to like it. To want it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on, pretty girl. Come swim with the big boys,‚Äù I teased. Her mouth puckered up in a frown. She didn‚Äôt like me calling her pretty girl. Her reaction to it only made me want to do it more.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust the big boys,‚Äù she replied. Her head tilted to the side and she raised one eyebrow.  
  
¬† Chuckling to myself, I couldn‚Äôt remember a time in my life that one female had entertained me so much. ‚ÄúAre you scared?‚Äù  
  
¬† Her eyebrows snapped together this time and I laughed harder. If you wanted Harlow to do something, then taunting her was the way to go. She didn‚Äôt back down from a dare or a threat. There was a silent toughness in her that you didn‚Äôt know existed until you spent time with her. ‚ÄúMy pretty girl is getting all fired up. Come get me.‚Äù  
  
¬† Harlow let out a small growl of frustration. ‚ÄúStop calling me that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù was my only reply.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou drive me crazy.‚Äù  
  
¬† I closed some of the space between us. ‚ÄúI drive most girls crazy, babe. It‚Äôs what I do. And they like it.‚Äù  
  
¬† A grin tugged at her lips but she was trying very hard to hold her frown. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine why they would like it.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stopped when I got a couple of inches from her body. ‚ÄúSame reason you like it. I‚Äôm so damn sexy, you can‚Äôt stay away.‚Äù  
  
¬† Harlow let out a laugh this time. ‚ÄúIs that so? If I recall, it‚Äôs you who keeps showing up at my house. I‚Äôm not the one unable to stay away.‚Äù  
  
¬† She had a point. I had just flown all the way back here from Florida just to see her. I reached out and rested my hand on her hip. Her whole body went rigid under my touch. ‚ÄúOkay, so maybe I can‚Äôt seem to stay away, but you keep letting me in the house, pretty girl.‚Äù  
  
¬† Harlow sighed. ‚ÄúGuess you got me there.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, see, I‚Äôm sexy and irresistible.‚Äù  
  
¬† Harlow started to say something then stopped.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou decide not to argue with me?‚Äù I asked, stepping close enough to her that our bodies were almost touching. One move and her breasts would brush up against my chest.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù she asked. Her breathing was fast, and the nervous look in her eyes reminded me of a frightened deer.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust getting closer. You make me want to get closer.‚Äù  
  
¬† Harlow took a deep breath and she glanced down at our bodies before looking back up at me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think friends do this,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† I pulled her up against my body, holding her hips firmly in both my hands. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt. But I don‚Äôt think about my friends the way I think about you, either. Tell me you aren‚Äôt attracted to me. Tell me you don‚Äôt think about touching me or getting close to me.‚Äù  
  
¬† If she said she didn‚Äôt, I would back away. It would be hard, but I‚Äôd back away. I would give her the room she needed. I just wanted to hear her say she didn‚Äôt want me, because I damn well wanted her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure . . . I don‚Äôt think . . . what I want is irrelevant. You and Nan . . .‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMe and Nan are over. There is no me and Nan. But there is a me and you. Even if you don‚Äôt want to admit it, it‚Äôs there.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nothing like Nan.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt know that? Damn, girl, if you were like Nan I wouldn‚Äôt be here. I ended things with Nan because she‚Äôs poison. You‚Äôre everything she isn‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
¬† Harlow‚Äôs body began to slowly ease under my touch. I moved my thumbs against her waist in small circles, gently. ‚ÄúMost guys like me because of my dad. I keep my distance. I don‚Äôt want to be a status symbol.‚Äù  
  
¬† A sharp pain shot through my chest at her vulnerable words. Damn. Rush had lived with this same problem, but he hadn‚Äôt been a girl. He‚Äôd been a guy who didn‚Äôt care. He hadn‚Äôt been looking for someone to want him just for him. Not until Blaire. Thinking about a guy using sweet Harlow just to get near her father pissed me off. If I could hunt down every bastard that had hurt her I would.  
  
¬† I lifted my hand and tilted her chin up so that she was looking me directly in the eyes. I wanted her to see I was serious. I wanted her to believe me. ‚ÄúNever would I use you to get near your dad. I‚Äôve known Kiro all my life. Rush is my best friend. I‚Äôm not starstruck by the members or lifestyle of Slacker Demon. This is all about you. I want you. Just you, Harlow. Just you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Tears prickled her big hazel eyes and she blinked rapidly. Had no one ever told her that?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWill you kiss me now?‚Äù she whispered.  
  
¬† Damn. I felt like I was in junior high school again with my first crush. Five simple words from her and she had my hands trembling. I never expected her to ask me that. I wasn‚Äôt giving her time to change her mind, either. Covering her soft lips with mine was like nirvana. She tasted so damn sweet. It was one of the reasons I‚Äôd started calling her sweet girl.  
  
¬† I licked her bottom lip because I couldn‚Äôt get enough of her before exploring her mouth. Taking in her heat. Feeling her press her body against mine and her hands tangle in my hair. I was keeping her. I would do whatever I had to do to keep her. Hell, I‚Äôd move to L.A. if I had to. I wasn‚Äôt letting her go. For the first time in my life I felt home.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI told you so,‚Äù I whispered against her lips before claiming her mouth again.  
  
¬† Harlow  
  
¬† Present day  
  
¬† He had only called once after his friend had drowned. He‚Äôd been drunk and hadn‚Äôt made much sense. I had hoped he would call again the next day, but he hadn‚Äôt. I knew he was grieving and I decided it was a sign from God that he was fixing things. I had messed it up and allowed Grant to get close to me, and I hadn‚Äôt told him. I was lucky he never really cared for me. I had thought he did, and for a moment I let myself live in that fantasy.  
  
¬† I knew better now. The sweet words he‚Äôd spoken had all been a ploy, and they had all worked on me. I had taken them hook, line, and sinker. If I could take back that night, I would. I wasn‚Äôt going to romanticize it anymore. I had given him a part of myself I couldn‚Äôt get back. He had taken my virginity and run. For once I had let myself pretend.  
  
¬† I sat on the bed and stared out the window at the gulf outside. This was going to be an even tougher nine months than I‚Äôd first imagined. Not only did I have to deal with Nan, but I had to deal with Grant and Nan. I wouldn‚Äôt let it hurt me. I was stronger than that. Grant had taken my virginity but I had already been robbed of my innocence. Loving Jeremiah Duke had done that to me. I‚Äôd thought he loved me; I had thought he was my forever. He was so attentive and sweet. He carried my books at school and treated me with such care. I had told him the truth and he had pretended it didn‚Äôt matter.  
  
¬† Then I‚Äôd found him behind the bleachers after his football practice with Nikki Sharp‚Äôs cheerleading skirt pulled up and his shorts pulled down as he screwed her up against the cement wall. That had been it for me. I realized then that I was just Kiro‚Äôs daughter, and I was broken. I was only wanted for my social status. Nothing about me was special. That‚Äôs all guys saw when they looked at me.  
  
¬† Except Grant.  
  
¬† He had been different. I hadn‚Äôt been Kiro‚Äôs daughter to him. I‚Äôd just been a challenge. Once he got the goods, he was done. My grandmama had always warned me about guys like him. She‚Äôd be so let down if she could see me now. I shook my head. I couldn‚Äôt think about that. It only made me feel worse. I was a survivor and I didn‚Äôt dwell on things. Feeling sorry for myself never got me anywhere. It wasn‚Äôt something I did. Wherever I was and whatever situation I was put in, I survived. I was good at it. Grandmama  
always said, ‚ÄúGirl, you better hold that head up high and don‚Äôt let ‚Äôem see you fall. You show ‚Äôem the steel in that spine. I ain‚Äôt raisin‚Äô a spoiled princess. I‚Äôm raisin‚Äô a woman. A hard-working, self-sufficient, ‚Äòdon‚Äôt need no man‚Äô woman. You hear me?‚Äù Never once did she act like there was anything wrong with me. She believed I was whole. I was fine. And at times I believed it, too.  
  
¬† Standing back up, I went to take a shower. I would get ready and go to the club and play tennis. They had a tennis pro there whom I could work with. Then I would play a round of golf. I would fill my days with things I could do without friends. Maybe even lie out at the club‚Äôs pool. I was going to make it through this.  
  
¬† Two months and three weeks ago . . .  
  
¬† The morning after Grant had kissed me in the pool, he was gone. The way he‚Äôd acted after kissing me had been strange. I wasn‚Äôt sure what was wrong or if he had just regretted it and didn‚Äôt know how to get away from me. Waking up the next morning without Grant there had answered that question.  
  
¬† Dad was also gone. He hadn‚Äôt come home from his latest party binge, but then I wasn‚Äôt surprised by that. Grant‚Äôs running off had hurt me. I hated that I felt anything for him. Kissing him had been a mistake. I wasn‚Äôt his type. I never wanted to be his type. Nan was not someone a sane person would desire to be with.  
  
¬† Locking myself up in my room to read didn‚Äôt sound as appealing as it had before Grant. Instead, I threw myself into tennis and swimming. I pushed all thoughts of Grant‚Äôs face out of my mind the best that I could. Someone should‚Äôve put a warning label on his lips: Beware, don‚Äôt touch. They were hard to forget.  
  
¬† Three days after Grant had disappeared, I was outside swimming. Today I had successfully managed to push all thoughts of Grant to the back of my mind. So when my head broke the water to find Grant Carter standing there, looking down at me, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was imagining things or if he was really there.  
  
¬† I pushed my wet hair back and wiped the water from my eyes. Then I opened them again, and there he stood. Still there.

1l5kxr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l5kxr8/my_roommate_22f_betrayed_my_trust_20f_shortly/,My roommate (22F) betrayed my trust (20F) shortly after moving in with me by deciding to continue to pursue a guy (23M) who really messed me up mentally even when she knows what happened between us. I don't know if I should ask her to move out to keep my peace since she thinks I'm overreacting.,"For some context, I moved to a new town at the beginning of the year for a new job opportunity, pretty much wiping the slate clean and restarting my life while in prep for a bodybuilding show. I work at a gym so meeting new people always came easy to me. I am also a competitive bodybuilder who competed in a show in the middle of March. I was talking to someone for some time before I started talking to this guy who is the one in the story but It ended abruptly out of nowhere. 

So, a few weeks later I started to somehow talk to another individual(we were both prepping for shows at the same time) who I'd always see at the gym and was interested in but never made any moves towards until I was about to compete. The one he was gonna compete in was the second BB show I was planning to do before I ultimately decided not to, so we bonded over that. He needed to use the posing room one Sunday evening at a different gym about 45 min away, that is the only gym we offer with a posing room. Said he was gonna meet his coach there to pose and I offered to meet him there to unlock it for him. He was really grateful and me being the kind individual I am, I drove all the way out there (mind you this was the start of my peak week) and unlocked it for him, only for this dudes coach to end up ignoring his messages and never showed up. So we ended up kinda training together and goofing off. We chatted for quite a while in the posing room, and I eventually felt the courage enough to open up to him and tell him about what the previous guy did to me only a few weeks prior. I only told him because they were friends, and when both of them were at the gym together they‚Äôd end up talking. I knew internally that if anything was to come out of us talking, that I wanted to be up front about the other guy from day one. So I told him, he felt really bad for me about what the guy put me through, and I was grateful I said something. 



We started talking every day after that, would see me at work all the time, and eventually as we kept talking I realized his coaches protocol he had him on was terrible, and was not going to bring him his best package to stage. I realized this early on, and offered to basically take over his prep for him for the remaining few weeks. He was really glad I did, so me being me I jumped into action to help save him. He was already in good standing, but a few minor tweaks here and there from me really helped. I would meet him at the gym when I wasn‚Äôt working to help him pose, give him different food/cardio protocols, and even took him to Walmart the start of his peak week to get all the foods he needed to get to stage. He basically gave me the credit as his coach at that point. Even when I competed back in March, he was extremely supportive, was so invested, wanted to take me out to eat after his show. After my show, we ended up lifting together all the time, even one morning I picked him up and drove us to the ocean about 45min away to watch the sunrise and we ended up talking for two hours and then drove back to the gym to lift together. He would bring me coffee during my shifts, we went on coffee dates, one evening he even left me an easter basket on top of my car while I was working to say thank you for everything I helped him with. Other people and some of my clients started to notice us hanging around each other and got curious, but also were wicked happy for me and thought he was a really sweet guy. I thought so too. Fast forward to his peak week, I ended up meeting this guys mom when I went to go to his house to pick him up after work, because I was going to drive us to Crumbl which is also 40min from us. But thats what he wanted post show, so of course I offered. Bought him a whole box, and then the day of his show I met up with him and his mom, and we all rode to South Portland that morning to watch him compete.¬†

That day was incredible. He ended up winning his pro card in mens physique and I literally met his entire family. Grandparents and all. After he competed he was headed out to dinner with his sister and I was going to ride back home with his mom. He gave me a hug thanking me for all of the help I gave him throughout his prep, and then we went our separate ways. On the ride back home, his mom literally ended up in tears because she was so happy I came into her sons life, and could tell how genuine I am as a woman, and wanted nothing more for us to end up together. I felt so confident in that moment.¬†

Fast forward that night and the next few days, dude basically pulled back from me. I would get 1 or 2 messages a day and they were incredibly dry. I could tell something was really off. I didn‚Äôt ask questions though, and then a few days later after barely hearing from him he messaged me and said ‚Äúhey, I just wanted to let you know that i'm going through some stuff right now. Im not trying to not talk to you so I apologize if I seem off‚Äù. And I responded offering my support if he needed anything, he heart reacted to the message the next day and then proceeded to ghost me for almost a month.¬†



When I finally started recovering from that one too, he messaged me out of blue at the end of April basically saying that he knows I talked to his mom and wanted to clear the air. He ‚Äúapologized‚Äù for going ghost after his show (also to add context he had ACL surgery the week after his competition so I knew I wouldn‚Äôt see him) and that he thought he was ready for something more but just isn‚Äôt, and hoped we could be friends. I messaged him back saying i'm glad his surgery went well, but he hurt me extremely bad when I don't let people in easily. I was mad because I told him from the start what the other guy did to me, just for him to do it to me too but only 5x worse. I said I hope he can get back to training but I wish him the best and that was that.



Thought that would be the end of it but I guess not. When me and him were still talking, I told him my friend would be moving in with me towards the end of April before I went away on training. She eventually moved in with me, and the day she moved in I opened up to her about what has happened to me the last few months with these two guys. She felt really bad for me, and I thought that was that. So I ended up going away on my Guard training (also in the military), and while I was gone I started noticing that he was liking her instagram posts. When I got home last Saturday night, me and my roommate were chatting, and I asked her openly that if he had said anything to her since I saw that he was liking her stuff. She then told me (and showed me the messages) that he slid into her DM‚Äôs and said ‚Äúhey, I think you're absolutely gorgeous, how are you doing today‚Äù? She proceeded to say that she was fine and asked how he was. He then said ‚Äúwell my day was good until I saw you but now its great‚Äù. He asked her if she wanted to lift with him, but she turned it down because of me and knew the situation. I thought that was the end of it and as angry as I was, just dropped the situation. A few days later, i'm coming to work in the morning only to see them talking with each other for like 15-20min straight. By then I knew something was up between them that she wasn‚Äôt telling me.¬†



So I asked her again that day during work if anything was still going on. She told me that he‚Äôs been hardcore flirting with her, and she‚Äôs not opposed to it either. She said she doesn‚Äôt know if it will, but if it keeps going and eventually leads to more she ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt bring him to the apartment if I was there‚Äù. (Mind you, before she moved in with me at the end of April she lived with her ex in the town she moved from and they broke up right before she left) The disrespect I felt from that conversation was unreal. And her philosophy behind thinking this whole thing is okay is that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs from the county and a really small town where everyone dates everyone so it doesn‚Äôt bother her like how it would bother me‚Äù. I just dont know how to feel or what to do. Because she literally just moved in with me not even a month ago. I also held the spot at my apartment and turned down other people because I wanted her to move in so we could form a stronger friendship. But I just feel like the trust and respect between us is already broken. I brought this up to another girlfriend of mine yesterday for her opinion and she felt the exact same way about it that I do, and didn‚Äôt make me feel like i'm crazy. I don't know what to do anymore. I found out that on Memorial Day she went and spent the day with his family, is brining him home with her for the 4th of July, they even come to the gym together all the time when I'm training or working with clients, to which it is incredibly uncomfortable. He has made it clear that he wants to date, which he said in the message to me just a month ago that he wasn't ready for anything more. I've tried to be the bigger person and let it go, but when my life revolves around my job and she also lives with me (and we work together, I got her the job she has now) - It's been super painful and I just honestly feel like I am in such a hole. Some people have been telling me to just give her the boot but I just feel guilty if I were to already ask her to move out when she just got here. I just don't know what to do. It leaves such an uneasy feeling in my chest whenever I see them together since I just have to shut up and watch it happen and can't say anything. Any advice on what to do in this situation would be great. Even if most of you think I need to just suck it up - then that would be that. I just need some guidance, since I feel like such an idiot or childish talking about it out loud.",4,1749303164.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

On instinct, I reached under the seat and grabbed my nine-millimeter. I swung it up and directly at the intruder, holding it with both hands ready to pull back on the trigger. Whoa‚Ä¶ I was gonna tell you that you were lost but I‚Äôll tell you....","Chapter One  
  
¬† Trucks with mud on the tires were what I was used to seeing parked outside a house party. Expensive foreign cars weren‚Äôt. This place had at least twenty of them covering up the long driveway. I pulled my mom‚Äôs fifteen- year-old Ford truck over onto the sandy grass so that I wouldn‚Äôt be blocking anyone in. Dad hadn‚Äôt told me that he was having a party tonight. He hadn‚Äôt told me much of anything.  
  
¬† He also hadn‚Äôt shown up for my mother‚Äôs funeral. If I didn‚Äôt need somewhere to live, I wouldn‚Äôt be here. I‚Äôd had to sell the small house that my grandmother had left us to pay off the last of mom‚Äôs medical bills. All I had left was my clothes and the truck. Calling my father, after he had failed to come even once during the three years my mother had fought cancer, had been hard. It had been necessary though; he was the only family I had left.  
  
¬† I stared at the massive three-story house that sat directly on the white sand in Rosemary Beach, Florida. This was my dad‚Äôs new home. His new family. I wasn‚Äôt going to fit in here.  
  
¬† My truck door was suddenly jerked open. On instinct, I reached under the seat and grabbed my nine-millimeter. I swung it up and directly at the intruder, holding it with both hands ready to pull back on the trigger.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhoa‚Ä¶ I was gonna tell you that you were lost but I‚Äôll tell you whatever the hell you want me to as long as you put that thing away.‚Äù A guy with brown shaggy hair tucked behind his ears stood on the other side of my gun with both his hands in the air and eyes wide.  
  
¬† I cocked an eyebrow and held my gun steady. I still didn‚Äôt know who this guy was. Jerking someone‚Äôs truck door open wasn‚Äôt a normal greeting for a stranger. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm lost. Is this Abraham Wynn‚Äôs house?‚Äù  
  
¬† The guy swallowed nervously, ‚ÄúUh, I can‚Äôt think with that pointed in my face. You‚Äôre making me very nervous, sweetheart. Could you put it down before you have an accident?‚Äù  
  
¬† Accident? Really? This guy was beginning to piss me off. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know you. It‚Äôs dark outside and I‚Äôm in a strange place, alone. So, forgive me if I don‚Äôt feel very safe at the moment. You can trust me when I tell you that there won‚Äôt be an accident. I can handle a gun. Very well.‚Äù  
  
¬† The guy didn‚Äôt appear to believe me and now that I was looking at him he didn‚Äôt appear to be real threatening. Nevertheless, I wasn‚Äôt ready to lower my gun just yet.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAbraham?‚Äù he repeated slowly and started to shake his head then stopped, ‚ÄúWait,  
  
¬† Abe is Rush‚Äôs new stepdad. I met him before he and Georgiana left for Paris.‚Äù  
  
¬† Paris? Rush? What? I waited for more of an explanation but the guy continued to stare at the gun and hold his breath. Keeping my eyes on him, I lowered my protection and made sure to put the safety back on before tucking it under my seat. Maybe with the gun put away the guy could focus and explain.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you even have a license for that thing?‚Äù he asked incredulously.  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to talk about my right to bear arms. I needed answers.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAbraham is in Paris?‚Äù I asked needing confirmation. He knew I was coming today. We‚Äôd just talked last week after I‚Äôd sold the house.  
  
¬† The guy nodded slowly and his stance relaxed. ‚ÄúYou know him?‚Äù  
  
¬† Not really. I had seen him all of two times since he‚Äôd walked out on my mom and me five years ago. I remembered the Dad who‚Äôd come to my soccer games and grilled burgers outside for the neighborhood block parties. The Dad I‚Äôd had until the day my twin sister Valerie was killed in a car accident. My father had been driving. He‚Äôd changed that day. The man that didn‚Äôt call me and make sure I was okay while I took care of my sick mother, I didn‚Äôt know him. Not at all.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm his daughter, Blaire.‚Äù  
  
¬† The guy‚Äôs eyes went wide and he threw back his head and laughed. Why was this funny? I waited for him to explain when he held out his hand. ‚ÄúCome on Blaire, I have someone you need to meet. He‚Äôs gonna love this.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stared down at his hand and reached for my purse.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you packing in your purse too? Should I warn everyone not to piss you off?‚Äù The teasing lilt to his voice kept me from saying something rude.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou opened my door without knocking. I was scared.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour instant reaction to being scared is to pull out a gun on someone? Damn  
  
¬† girl, where are you from? Most girls I know squeal or some shit like that.‚Äù  
  
¬† Most girls he knew hadn‚Äôt been forced to protect themselves for the past three  
  
¬† years. I‚Äôd had my mother to take care of but no one to take care of me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Alabama,‚Äù I replied ignoring his hand and stepping out of the truck myself.  
  
¬† The sea breeze hit my face and the salty smell of the beach was unmistakable. I‚Äôd never seen the beach before. At least not in person. I‚Äôd seen pictures and movies. But the smell, it was exactly like I expected it to be.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs true what they say about girls from Bama,‚Äù he replied and I turned my attention to him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù  
  
¬† His eyes scanned down my body and back up to my face. A grin stretched slowly across his face. ‚ÄúTight jeans, tank tops, and a gun. Damn, I‚Äôve been living in the wrong fucking state.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rolling my eyes, I reached into the back of the truck. I had a suitcase and then several boxes that I needed to drop off at the Goodwill.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHere, let me get it.‚Äù He stepped around me then reached into the truck  
bed for the large piece of luggage my mom had kept tucked away in her closet for that ‚Äúroad trip‚Äù we never got to take. She always talked about how we‚Äôd drive across the country and then up the west coast one day. Then she‚Äôd gotten sick.  
  
¬† Shaking off the memories, I focused on the present. ‚ÄúThank you, uh‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I got your name.‚Äù  
  
¬† The guy pulled the suitcase out then turned back to me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat? You forgot to ask when you had the nine-millimeter pointed at my face?‚Äù he replied.  
  
¬† I sighed. Okay, maybe I‚Äôd gone a little overboard with the gun but he‚Äôd scared me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Grant, a, uh, friend of Rush‚Äôs.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRush?‚Äù There was that name again. Who was Rush?  
  
¬† Grant‚Äôs grin grew big once again. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know who Rush is?‚Äù He was extremely amused. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so fucking glad I came tonight.‚Äù  
  
¬† He nodded his head toward the house, ‚ÄúCome on. I‚Äôll introduce you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I walked beside him as he led me to the house. The music inside got louder as we got closer. If my dad wasn‚Äôt here, then who was? I knew Georgiana was his new wife but that was all I knew. Was this a party her kids were having? How old were they? She did have kids, didn‚Äôt she? I couldn‚Äôt remember. Dad had been vague. He‚Äôd said I‚Äôd like my new family but he hadn‚Äôt said who that family was exactly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, does Rush live here?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, he does, at least in the summer. He moves to his other houses according to the season.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHis other houses?‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant chuckled, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know anything about this family your dad has married into, do you, Blaire?‚Äù  
  
¬† He had no idea. I shook my head.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúQuick mini lesson then before we walk inside the madness,‚Äù he replied stopping at the top of the stairs leading to the front door and looked at me. ‚ÄúRush Finlay is your stepbrother. He‚Äôs the only child of the famous drummer for Slacker Demon, Dean Finlay. His parents never married. His mother, Georgianna, was a groupie back in the day. This is his house. His mother gets to live here because he allows it.‚Äù He stopped and looked back at the door, as it swung open. ‚ÄúThese are all his friends.‚Äù  
  
¬† A tall, willowy, strawberry blonde wearing a short royal blue dress and a pair of heels that I‚Äôd break my neck in if I tried to wear them stood there staring at me. I didn‚Äôt miss the distaste in her scowl. I didn‚Äôt know much about people like this but I did know that my department store clothing wasn‚Äôt something she approved of. Either that or I had a bug crawling on me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, hello Nannette,‚Äù Grant replied in an annoyed tone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù the girl asked, shifting her gaze to Grant.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA friend. Wipe the snarl off your face Nan it isn‚Äôt an attractive look for you,‚Äù he replied, reaching over to grab my hand and pull me into the house behind him.  
  
¬† The room wasn‚Äôt as full as I‚Äôd assumed. As we walked past the large open foyer an arched doorway led into what I assumed was a living room. Even so, it was bigger than my entire house or what had been my house. Two glass doors were standing open with a breathtaking view of the ocean. I wanted to see that up close.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis way,‚Äù Grant instructed as he made his way over to a‚Ä¶ bar? Really? There was a bar in the house?  
  
¬† I glanced over the people we passed by. They all paused for a moment and gave me a quick once over. I stood out big time.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRush, meet Blaire, I believe she might belong to you. I found her outside looking a little lost,‚Äù Grant said and I swung my gaze from the curious people to see who this Rush was.  
  
¬† Oh.  
  
¬† Oh. My.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs that so?‚Äù Rush replied in a lazy drawl and leaned forward from his relaxed position on the white sofa with a beer in his hand. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs cute but she‚Äôs young. Can‚Äôt say she‚Äôs mine.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs yours alright. Seeing as her daddy has run off to Paris with your momma for the next few weeks. I‚Äôd say this one now belongs to you. I‚Äôd gladly offer her a room at my place if you want. That is if she promises to leave her deadly weapon in the truck.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rush narrowed his eyes and studied me closely. They were an odd color. Stunningly unusual. They weren‚Äôt brown. They weren‚Äôt hazel. They were a warm color with some silver laced through them. I‚Äôd never seen anything like them. Could they be contacts?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make her mine,‚Äù he finally replied and leaned back on the sofa where he‚Äôd been reclining when we walked up.  
  
¬† Grant cleared his throat. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding, right?‚Äù  
  
¬† Rush didn‚Äôt reply. Instead he took a drink from the longneck bottle in his hands. His gaze had shifted to Grant‚Äôs and I could see the warning there. I was going to be asked to leave. This wasn‚Äôt good. I had exactly twenty dollars in my purse and I was almost out of gas. I‚Äôd already sold anything of value that I possessed. When I‚Äôd called my father I had explained that I just needed somewhere to stay until I could get a job and make enough money to go find a place of my own. He had quickly agreed and given me this address telling me he would love for me to come stay with him.  
  
¬† Rush‚Äôs attention was back on me. He was waiting on me to make a move. What did he expect me to say? A smirk touched his lips and he winked at me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI got a house full of guests tonight and my bed‚Äôs already full.‚Äù He shifted his eyes to Grant. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs best if we let her go find a hotel until I can get in touch with her daddy.‚Äù  
  
¬† The disgust on his tongue as he said the words ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù hadn‚Äôt gone unnoticed. He didn‚Äôt like my father. I couldn‚Äôt blame him really. This wasn‚Äôt his fault. My dad had sent me here. I‚Äôd wasted most of my money on gas and food driving here. Why had I trusted that man?  
  
¬† I reached over and grabbed the handle on the suitcase that Grant was still holding. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right. I should go. This was a very bad idea,‚Äù I explained without looking at him. I tugged hard on the suitcase and he let go somewhat reluctantly. Tears stung my eyes as the realization that I was about to be homeless sunk in. I couldn‚Äôt look at either of them.  
  
¬† Turning, I headed for the door, keeping my eyes downcast. I heard Grant arguing with Rush but I blocked it out. I didn‚Äôt want to hear what that beautiful man said about me. He didn‚Äôt like me. That much was obvious. My dad was not a welcome member of the family apparently.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLeaving so soon?‚Äù a voice that reminded me of smooth syrup asked. I glanced up to see the delighted smile on the girl who had opened the door earlier. She hadn‚Äôt wanted me here either. Was I that revolting to these people? I quickly dropped my eyes back to the floor and opened the door. I had too much pride for that mean bitch to see me cry.  
  
¬† Once I was safely outside I let out a sob and headed to my truck. If I hadn‚Äôt been carrying my suitcase I‚Äôd have run. I needed the safety of it. I belonged inside my truck, not in this ridiculous house with these uppity people. I missed home. I missed my mom. Another sob broke free and I closed the door to my truck locking it behind me.  
  
¬† Chapter Two  
  
¬† I wiped my eyes and forced myself to take a deep breath. I couldn‚Äôt fall apart now. I hadn‚Äôt fallen apart when I‚Äôd sat holding my mother‚Äôs hand as she took her last breath. I hadn‚Äôt fallen apart as they lowered her into the cold ground. And I hadn‚Äôt fallen apart when I‚Äôd sold the only place I had to live. I would not fall apart now. I would get through this.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt have enough for a hotel room but I had my truck. I could live in my truck. Finding a safe place to park it at night would be my only problem. This town seemed safe enough but I was pretty sure this old truck parked anywhere overnight would draw attention. I‚Äôd have the cops knocking on my window before I could even fall asleep. I would have to use my last twenty dollars on fuel. Then I could drive into a larger city where my truck would go unnoticed in a parking lot.  
  
¬† Maybe I could park behind a restaurant and get a job there too. I wouldn‚Äôt need gas to get to and from work. My stomach growled reminding me that I hadn‚Äôt eaten since this morning. I would need to spend a couple dollars on some food. Then pray I would find a job in the morning.  
  
¬† I woul  
d be okay. I turned my head to check behind me before I cranked the truck and backed out. Silver eyes stared back at me.  
  
¬† A small scream escaped me before I realized that it was Rush. What was he doing standing outside my truck? Had he come to make sure I left his property? I really didn‚Äôt want to talk to him anymore. I started to turn my eyes away and focus on getting out of there when he cocked an eyebrow at me. What did that mean?  
  
¬† You know what? I really didn‚Äôt care. Even if he looked ridiculously sexy doing it. I started to crank the truck but instead of the roar of the engine, I was met with a click and some silence. Oh no. Not now. Please not now.  
  
¬† I jiggled the key and prayed I was wrong. I knew the gas gauge was broken but I‚Äôd been watching the mileage. I shouldn‚Äôt be out of gas. I had a few more miles. I know I did.  
  
¬† I slammed my palm against the steering wheel and called the truck a few choice names but nothing happened. I was stuck. Would Rush call the police? He wanted me off his property so badly he‚Äôd come out here to make sure I left. Now that I couldn‚Äôt leave would he have me arrested? Or worse, call a tow truck. I did not have the money to get my truck back if he did that. At least in jail I‚Äôd have a bed and food.  
  
¬† Swallowing the lump lodged firmly in my throat I opened the truck door and hoped for the best.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúProblems?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† I wanted to scream to the top of my lungs in frustration. Instead, I managed a nod. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of gas.‚Äù Rush let out a sigh. I didn‚Äôt speak. I decided waiting on the verdict was the best option here. I could always beg and plead afterward.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† What? Was he really asking me my age? I was stuck in his driveway, he wanted me to leave and instead of discussing my options he was asking me my age. The guy was strange.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNineteen,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† Rush raised both his eyebrows, ‚ÄúReally?

¬†I was trying hard not to get pissed off. I needed this guy to have mercy on me. Forcing the snide comment that was on the tip of my tongue back, I smiled. ‚ÄúYes. Really.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rush grinned and shrugged. ‚ÄúSorry. You just look younger.‚Äù He stopped and his eyes trailed down my body and back up again slowly. The sudden heat in my cheeks was embarrassing. ‚ÄúI take that back. Your body looks every bit of nineteen. It‚Äôs that face of yours that looks so fresh and young. You don‚Äôt wear makeup?‚Äù  
  
¬† Was that a question? What was he doing? I wanted to know what my immediate future held, not discuss the fact that wearing makeup was a luxury that I couldn‚Äôt afford. Besides, Cain, my exboyfriend and current best friend, had always said I didn‚Äôt need to add to my looks any. Whatever that meant.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of gas. I have twenty dollars to my name. My father has run off and left me after telling me he‚Äôd help me get back on my feet. Trust me; he was the LAST person I wanted to ask for help. No, I don‚Äôt wear makeup. I have bigger problems than looking pretty. Now, are you going to call the police or a tow truck? I prefer the police in case I get a choice.‚Äù I snapped my mouth closed ending my rant. He‚Äôd pushed me too far and I hadn‚Äôt been able to control my mouth. Now, I‚Äôd stupidly given him the stupid notion of a tow truck. Dangit.  
  
¬† Rush tilted his head and studied me. The silence was almost more than I could handle. I‚Äôd just shared a little too much information with this guy. He could make my life harder if he wanted to.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like your father and from the tone in your voice, neither do you,‚Äù he said thoughtfully. ‚ÄúThere is one room that is empty tonight. It will be until my mom gets home. I don‚Äôt keep her maid around when she isn‚Äôt here. Mrs. Henrietta only stops by to clean once a week while Mom is on vacation. You can have her bedroom under the stairs. It‚Äôs small but it‚Äôs got a bed.‚Äù  
  
¬† He was offering me a room. I would not burst into tears. I could do that later tonight. I wasn‚Äôt going to jail. Thank God.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy only other option is this truck. I can assure you that what you‚Äôre offering is much better. Thank you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rush frowned a moment, then it vanished quickly and he had an easy smile on his face again. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your suitcase?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† I closed the truck door and walked over to the back of the truck to get it out. Before I could reach for it, a warm body that smelled foreign and delicious reached over me. I froze as Rush grabbed my luggage and pulled it out.  
  
¬† Turning around I looked up at him. He winked at me. ‚ÄúI can carry your bag. I‚Äôm not that big of an ass.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you, again,‚Äù I stuttered, unable to look away from his gaze. Those eyes of his were incredible. The thick black lashes that framed them almost looked like eyeliner. He had an all-natural highlighter around his eyes. It was completely unfair. My lashes were blonde. What I wouldn‚Äôt give for lashes like his.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAh, good, you stopped her. I was giving you five minutes and then coming out here to make sure you hadn‚Äôt completely run her off.‚Äù Grant‚Äôs familiar voice snapped me out of my daze and I spun around thankful for an interruption. I had been gazing up at Rush like an idiot. I‚Äôm surprised he hadn‚Äôt sent me packing again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gonna take Henrietta‚Äôs room until I can get in touch with her father and figure something out.‚Äù Rush sounded annoyed. He stepped around me and handed Grant the suitcase. ‚ÄúHere, you take her to her room. I have company to get back to.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rush walked off without a backwards glance. It took all my willpower not to watch him walk away. Especially since his backside in a pair of jeans was extremely tempting. He was not someone I needed to be attracted to.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe is one moody sonuvabitch,‚Äù Grant said, shaking his head and looking back at me. I couldn‚Äôt disagree with him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to carry my suitcase inside again,‚Äù I said reaching for it.  
  
¬† Grant moved it back out of my reach. ‚ÄúI happen to be the charming brother. I‚Äôm not about to let you carry this suitcase when I have two very strong not to mention pretty damn impressive arms to carry them with.‚Äù  
  
¬† I would have smiled if not for the one word that had just thrown me for a loop. ‚ÄúBrother?‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† Grant smiled but the smile didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúI guess I forgot to mention that I‚Äôm the kid of Georgianna‚Äôs husband number two. She stayed married to my dad from the time I was three years old and Rush was four until I was fifteen. By then, Rush and I were brothers. Just because my dad divorced his mom didn‚Äôt change anything for us. We went to college together and even joined the same frat.‚Äù  
  
¬† Oh. Okay. I hadn‚Äôt been expecting that. ‚ÄúHow many husbands has Georgianna had?‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant let out a short hard laugh then started walking toward the door. ‚ÄúYour dad is husband number four.‚Äù  
  
¬† My dad was an idiot. This woman sounded like she went through husbands like she did panties. How long before she got rid of him and moved on?  
  
¬† Grant walked back up the steps and didn‚Äôt say anything else to me while we headed toward the kitchen. It was massive with black marble countertops and elaborate appliances. It reminded me of something out of a home decorating magazine. Then he opened a door that looked like a large walk in pantry. Confused I looked around then followed him inside. He walked to the back of it and opened another door.  
  
¬† He had enough room to walk inside and put my suitcase on the bed. I followed him in and scooted around the twin size bed that left only a few inches between it and the door. It was obvious I was under the stairs. A small nightstand fit tightly between the bed and the wall. Other than that, there was nothing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have no idea where you are supposed to keep your luggage. This room is small. I‚Äôve never actually been back here.‚Äù Grant shook his head and then sighed. ‚ÄúListen, if you want to come to my apartment with me you can. I‚Äôll at least give you a bedroom that you can move around in.‚Äù  
  
¬† As nice as Grant was I wasn‚Äôt about to take him up on that offer. He didn‚Äôt need an unwanted houseguest taking up one of his bedrooms. At least here I was tucked away so no one would see me. I could clean up around the house and get a job somewhere. Maybe Rush would let me sleep in this small unused room until I had enough money to move out. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was imposing so badly back here. I‚Äôd find a grocery story tomorrow and use my twenty dollars for some food. Peanut butter and bread should get me through a week or so.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is perfect. I‚Äôm out of the way back here. Besides, Rush is calling my dad tomorrow and finding out when he will be home. Maybe my father has a plan. I don‚Äôt know. Thank you though, I really appreciate the offer.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant looked around the room one more time and scowled. He wasn‚Äôt happy about this room but I was relieved. It was sweet of him to care.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI hate leaving you back here. It feels wrong.‚Äù He looked back at me this time with a pleading sound to his voice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is great. Much better than my truck would have been.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant frowned. ‚ÄúTruck? You were gonna sleep in your truck?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes. I was. This, however, gives me a little time to figure out what I‚Äôm gonna do next.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant ran a hand through his shaggy hair. ‚ÄúWill you promise me something?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt one to make promises. What I knew of promises was that they were easily broken. I shrugged. It was the best I could do.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf Rush makes you leave, call me.‚Äù  
  
¬† I started to agree and realized I didn‚Äôt have his phone number.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your phone so I can put my number in it?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† This was going to make me sound even more pathetic. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have one.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant gaped at me, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a cell phone? No wonder you carry a damn gun.‚Äù He reached into his pocket and pulled out what looked like a receipt. ‚ÄúYou got a pen?‚Äù  
  
¬† I pulled one out of my purse and handed it to him.  
  
¬† He quickly scribbled his number down and then handed the paper and the pen to me. ‚ÄúCall me. I mean it.‚Äù  
  
¬† I would never call him but it was nice that he was offering.  
I nodded. I hadn‚Äôt promised anything.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI hope you sleep okay in here.‚Äù He looked around the small room with concern in his eyes. I would sleep wonderfully.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI will,‚Äù I assured him.  
  
¬† He nodded and stepped out of the room closing the door behind him. I waited until I heard him close the pantry door as well before I sat down on the bed beside my suitcase. This was good. I could work with this.  
  
¬† Chapter Three  
  
¬† Even with no windows in the room to tell me if the sun was up, I knew I‚Äôd slept late. I had been exhausted but a long eight-hour drive and footsteps on the stairs for hours after I‚Äôd laid down kept me from sleeping. Stretching, I sat up and reached for the light switch on the wall. The small bulb lit the room and I reached under the bed to pull out my suitcase.  
  
¬† I needed a shower and I needed to use the restroom. Maybe everyone would still be asleep and I could sneak in and out of a bathroom without anyone noticing. Grant hadn‚Äôt shown me where one was last night. This was all I‚Äôd been offered. Hopefully a quick shower wouldn‚Äôt be pushing the limit.  
  
¬† I grabbed clean panties and a pair of black shorts with a sleeveless white top. If I was lucky, I‚Äôd get in and out of the shower and be cleaning up before Rush made his way downstairs.  
  
¬† I opened the door leading into the pantry then walked through the rows of shelves that held more food than anyone could possibly need. I slowly turned the doorknob on the door and eased it open. The kitchen light was off and the only light was the bright sun streaming in through the large windows overlooking the ocean. If I didn‚Äôt need to pee so badly I would go enjoy the view a moment. But nature was calling and I had to go. The house was silent. Empty drinks littered the place, along with leftover food and some pieces of clothing. I could clean this up. If I proved to be useful I might get to stay until I could get a job and a paycheck or two.  
  
¬† I slowly opened the first door I came to, afraid it could be a bedroom. It was a walk-in closet. Closing it, back I made my way down the hall toward the stairs. If the only bathrooms were attached to bedrooms I was screwed. Except‚Ä¶ maybe there was one that people used outside after being in the beach all day. Henrietta had to take showers and use the restroom too. Turning around I headed back to the kitchen and the two glass doors that had been standing open last night. Glancing around, I noticed a set of steps going down and underneath the house. I followed them.  
  
¬† At the bottom were two doors. I opened one and life jackets, surfboards and floats covered the walls. I went and opened the other one. Bingo.  
  
¬† A toilet was on one side and a small shower took up the other side of the room. Shampoo, conditioner and soap along with a fresh washcloth and a towel was on the small stool beside it. How convenient.  
  
¬† Once I was clean and dressed I hung the towel and bath cloth over the shower rod. This bathroom wasn‚Äôt used often. I could use the same towel and washcloth all week and then wash them on the weekends. If I was here that long.  
  
¬† I closed the door behind me and headed back up the steps. The ocean air smelled wonderful. Once I got to the top, I stood at the railing and looked out over the water. Waves crashed onto the white sandy beach. It was the most beautiful thing I‚Äôd ever seen.  
  
¬† Mom and I had talked about seeing the ocean together one day. She‚Äôd seen it as a little girl and her memories weren‚Äôt that great but she‚Äôd told me stories about it all my life. Every winter when it was cold, we would sit inside by the fire and plan our summer trip to the beach. We never were able to take it. First mom hadn‚Äôt been able to afford it and then she‚Äôd been too sick. We still planned them anyway. It helped to dream big.  
  
¬† Now, here I stood staring at the waves we‚Äôd only dreamed about. It wasn‚Äôt the fairytale vacation we‚Äôd planned but I was here seeing it for both of us.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat view never gets old.‚Äù Rush‚Äôs deep drawl startled me. I spun around to see Rush leaning against the open door. Shirtless. Oh. My.  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt form words. The only naked male chest I‚Äôd ever seen was Cain‚Äôs. And that had been back before my mom got sick when I‚Äôd had time for dates and fun. Cain‚Äôs sixteen-year-old chest had nothing on the broad, cut muscles in front of me. He had actual ripples in his stomach.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you enjoying the view?‚Äù His amused tone didn‚Äôt escape me. I blinked and lifted my eyes back up to see the smirk on his lips. Dangit. He‚Äôd caught me ogling him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let me interrupt you. I was enjoying it myself,‚Äù he replied, then took a sip from the coffee cup in his hand.  
  
¬† My face heated and I knew I was three kinds of red. Turning back around, I stared out at the ocean. How embarrassing. I was trying to get this guy to let me stay for a little while. Drooling was not the best move.  
  
¬† A low chuckle from behind me only made it worse. He was laughing at me. Fantastic.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere you are. I missed you in bed this morning.‚Äù A soft female coo came from behind me. Curiosity got the better of me and I turned around. A girl in nothing but her bra and panties was snuggling up to Rush‚Äôs side and running a long pink fingernail down his chest. I couldn‚Äôt blame her for wanting to touch that. I was pretty tempted myself.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for you to go,‚Äù he replied taking her hand off his chest and stepping away from her. I watched as he pointed in the direction of the front door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she replied. The confused expression on her face said she hadn‚Äôt been expecting this.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou got what you came here for, babe. You wanted me between your legs. You got it. Now I‚Äôm done.‚Äù  
  
¬† The cold hard flatness in his voice startled me. Was he serious?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding me!‚Äù the girl snapped and stomped her foot.  
  
¬† Rush shook his head and took another drink from his cup.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou are not going to do this to me. Last night was amazing. You know it.‚Äù The girl reached out for his arm and he quickly moved it out of the way.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI warned you last night when you came to me begging and taking off your clothes that all it would ever be was one night of sex. Nothing more.‚Äù  
  
¬† I shifted my attention back to the girl. Her face was in an angry snarl and she opened her mouth to argue but shut it again. With another stomp of her foot she stalked back inside the house.  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôd just seen. Was that the way people like this behaved? The only experience I‚Äôd had with relationships was with Cain. Although we‚Äôd never actually slept together he‚Äôd been careful and sweet with me. This was hard and cruel.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, how did you sleep last night?‚Äù Rush asked as if nothing had happened.  
  
¬† I tore my gaze off the door the girl had gone through and studied him. What had possessed that girl to sleep with someone who had told her it would be nothing more than sex? Sure, he had a body that underwear models were jealous of and those eyes of his could make a girl do crazy things. But still. He was so cruel.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you do that often?‚Äù I asked before I could stop myself.  
  
¬† Rush cocked an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat? Ask people if they slept well?‚Äù  
  
¬† He knew what I was asking. He was avoiding it. It wasn‚Äôt my business. I needed to stay out of the way so he would let me stay. Opening my mouth to scold him wasn‚Äôt a good idea.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHave sex with girls and then throw them out like trash?‚Äù I retorted. I closed my mouth, horrified as the words I‚Äôd just said echoed in my head. What was I doing? Trying to get tossed out?  
  
¬† Rush put his cup on the table beside him and sat down. He leaned back stretching out his long legs. Then he stared back up at me. ‚ÄúDo you always stick your nose where it doesn‚Äôt belong?‚Äù he replied.  
  
¬† I wanted to get mad at him. But I couldn‚Äôt. He was right. Who was I to point fingers? I didn‚Äôt know the guy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot normally, no. I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said and hurried inside. I didn‚Äôt want to give him a chance to throw me out too. I needed that bed under the stairs for at least two weeks.  
  
¬† I got busy picking up the empty glasses and bottles of beer. This place needed a cleaning and I could do that before I headed out to find a job. I just hoped he didn‚Äôt throw parties lik  
e this every night. If he did, I wouldn‚Äôt complain and who knows, after a few nights I might be able to sleep through anything.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do that. Henrietta will be here tomorrow.‚Äù  
  
¬† I dropped the bottles I‚Äôd collected into the trash and then looked over at him. He was standing at the door again watching me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI just thought I‚Äôd help out.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rush smirked. ‚ÄúI already have a housekeeper. I‚Äôm not looking to hire another one if that is what you‚Äôre thinking.‚Äù  
  
¬† I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo. I know that. I was just trying to be helpful. You let me sleep in your house last night.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rush walked over and stood in front of the counter crossing his arms over his chest. ‚ÄúAbout that. We need to talk.‚Äù  
  
¬† Oh, crap. Here it goes. One night was all I was getting.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† Rush frowned at me and I felt my heart rate increase. He wasn‚Äôt about to bestow happy news.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like your father. He‚Äôs a mooch. My mother always tends to find men like him. It‚Äôs her talent. But I‚Äôm thinking you may already know this about him. Which makes me curious, why did you come to him for help if you knew what he was like?‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôd like to tell him it was none of his business. Except the fact I‚Äôd needed his help made it his business. I couldn‚Äôt expect him to let me sleep in his house and not explain things to him. He deserved to know why he was helping me. I didn‚Äôt want him to think I was a mooch too.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy mother just passed away. She had cancer. Three years‚Äô worth of treatments add up. The only thing we owned was the house my grandmother left us. I had to sell the house everything else to pay off all my mother‚Äôs medical bills. I haven‚Äôt seen my dad since he walked out on us five years ago. But he‚Äôs the only family I have left. I had no one else to ask for help. I need a place to stay until I can find a job and get a few paychecks. Then I‚Äôll get my own place. I never intended to be around long. I knew my dad wouldn‚Äôt want me here.‚Äù I let out a hard laugh that I didn‚Äôt feel. ‚ÄúAlthough I never expected him to run off before I arrived.‚Äù

1l5kuj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1l5kuj6/review_viceroy_riviera_maya/,Review: Viceroy Riviera Maya,"**Background**

My wife and I went on this trip as our first real getaway from our three young kids. We went for three nights, from Friday to Monday, and this is only our second stay at an all-inclusive resort so we don‚Äôt have as many points of comparison as lots of other reviewers.¬†

It‚Äôs hard to imagine how the trip could have been better so I think I have to give it an overall 10/10. My wife and I are already itching to go back.

**Arrival / Check-in: 9/10**

We arranged for separate transfer and the drive was about 45 minutes from the airport. The last 10 minutes or so are down pretty narrow, bumpy roads which can be a little much but the driver handled it as best he could and eventually the roads gave way to jungle which made the last couple minutes feel particularly exciting.

Upon arrival, we were greeted with cold towels and refreshing horchata-style drinks. Our luggage was whisked away to our room while we got a tour of the grounds that ended at our villa. After getting a walkthrough of the amenities in our room, which included hand-cut soap they make on premises, the host kicked off our stay with a beautiful glass of mezcal with tajin and orange to have alongside.¬†

Based only on reading other reviews, I suppose some faster exit at the airport or sponsored transfer from the resort could have made it a 10/10.

**Room Quality: 10/10**

I felt like an annoying HGTV person searching for a place where I wouldn‚Äôt have to compromise: we wanted to be in nature but not rough it at all. These villas really pulled it off. The AC was strong and quick to cool the space. The bathroom was huge and well laid out. The outdoor shower was lovely. The bed was very comfortable and the minibar had perfect snacks for early morning (coffee, fruit, etc.)¬† or late night (alcohol, chips, cookies, etc.)

**Property: 10/10**

The grounds and properties truly made it feel like being one with nature. The winding paths through beautiful palm trees and small creeks were serene and added to the small, private vibes (which we were explicitly seeking).¬†

The combination pool, restaurant, and beachfront area was beautiful and kept us wanting to take pictures the whole time we were there.

The gym was small but had pretty much everything you need to get in a good workout while traveling. It was better equipped than plenty of nice hotel gyms I‚Äôve used before.

**Service: 10/10**

Every single person we interacted with on the staff was kind, generous, and genuine. They managed to find the perfect balance of attentiveness without being overbearing. I think they somehow had a sixth sense for knowing when we wanted drinks or food, and magically someone would appear.¬†

The staff on the beach was always willing to move umbrellas around to keep us in the shade and someone would even occasionally come around offering to clean our sunglasses. Truthfully that felt a little crazy to me, but damn if it didn‚Äôt feel luxurious.

I tried my best to speak Spanish as much as I could and I appreciated the staff being willing to give it a shot before jumping into english!

**Cleanliness: 10/10**

Housekeeping was quick and effective. They came once a day, typically in the morning, to clean, restock, and tidy the villa. The villa always felt completely clean - even the outdoor shower - which is the dream combination of nature meets luxury.¬†

**Food: 10/10**

The food was shockingly good. I‚Äôm not sure my wife or I had a bad bite the entire time we were there. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner were all excellent. We were initially worried that the limited restaurant options (one open for breakfast and lunch and two open for dinner) would be an issue but at least for our length of trip there was plenty of variety on the menu to enjoy. I could imagine it getting a little old if you stayed closer to a week.

They even had a special Yucatan-inspired menu with a guest chef one night we were there which included an awesome wine pairing. She came the day before and actually cooked a lot of the food in an underground pit fire which made the property smell incredible (but made us hungry!).

I thought we were in for ‚Äúresort good‚Äù but the food was legitimately great.

If you find yourself in the same boat, here‚Äôs what to expect and what I wish I knew before arriving.

Early Arrival is Crucial: We arrived at 6:30am and there were already about 200 people ahead of us. By 9:12am, we were finally at the front‚Äîbut by then, all English-speaking tours were fully booked.

Language Options Run Out Fast: We ended up on a German tour starting at 9:45am, with Russian tours available immediately. We don't speak German, so we bought a handbook inside, which was a big help.

Tour Experience Without the Language: Without understanding the guide, parts of the tour felt boring and disconnected. I felt genuinely jealous of those on the English tours, as they seemed to be getting so much more out of it.

Still Worth Going: Despite the language barrier, the experience was still very moving and educational. The second part of the tour (Birkenau) is more open and less guided, so you can break away from the group and explore at your own pace‚Äîthere are plenty of signs to guide you. The first part (Auschwitz I) is more controlled and you‚Äôll need to stay with your group.

Tips for Future Visitors:

Arrive even earlier than we did if you want a chance at an English tour.

If English tours are available later in the day, wait for them‚Äîit‚Äôs worth it.

Don‚Äôt stop for coffee or breakfast‚Äîhead straight there. There are options for breakfast once you're in line.

And most importantly: still go, even if you don‚Äôt have tickets. It‚Äôs absolutely worth the effort.",0,1749302767.0,krakow,1,0.44,False

1l5kp4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/s/uvTmw7arYt,Shobi - Review #2 after 2 months of maturation,"üëâ First review

Hello everyone,

Two months ago, I shared a first review on six perfumes I received from Shobi. 

I received quite a few private messages asking for feedback after a few weeks of use. I promised to do so, but due to lack of time and energy, I didn't stick to it. Today, I'm keeping my word and finally giving you my opinion after two months of use.

For the info, I've been a Chez Pierre customer for a long time, but between the high prices and perfumes that don't hold up at all (believe me, I've really tried everything), I ended up changing course.

It was thanks to an active member here, 
u/Low-Stomach-8831, that I discovered Shobi. He spoke very highly of it, so I gave it a try, and frankly, I don't regret it.

Some practical info:
I paid ‚Ç¨71 for 6 perfumes,  via FedEx Europe.
Order placed 07/03/25, received 15/03/25 (8 days, shipping from Greece to France üá´üá∑).

1. Intoxicated ‚Ä¢ Kilian
	- Notes: Spicy coffee, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg
	- Opinion : A gourmand fragrance, very spicy, with a nice dose of coffee. Perfect for autumn/winter, it brings a warm, enveloping sensation. Very successful.

2.	Ganymede ‚Ä¢ Marc-Antoine Barrois
	- Notes : Saffron, suede, violet, immortelle
	- Opinion: Mineral and futuristic, with a slight metallic touch. Elegant, very modern. A real favorite!

3.	Good Girl ‚Ä¢ Carolina Herrera
	- Notes : Almond, coffee, jasmine, tonka bean, cocoa
	- Opinion: Quite sweet. Not really my style, I didn't get hooked, but it will please those who like gourmand fragrances.

4.	 √âb√®ne Fum√© ‚Ä¢ Tom Ford
	- Notes: Ebony, incense, leather, resins
	- Opinion: A very woody, smoky fragrance, with lots of incense. The scent is really incredible, very sophisticated. Perfect for a date üëçüèª

5. Black Phantom ‚Ä¢ Kilian
	- Notes : Rum, coffee, caramel, dark chocolate, almond
	- Opinion : Ultra-gourmand and opulent. It's a very rich, sweet fragrance, perfect for those who love powerful scents.

6.	Angels' Share ‚Ä¢  Kilian
	- Notes : Cognac, cinnamon, hazelnut, vanilla, oak wood
	- Opinion: Inspired by cognac, this fragrance evokes a warm, festive atmosphere. It makes you think of a glass of refined, spicy alcohol. One of my favorites!

Note: I advise you to let the fragrances mature, to reach their full potential. You'll see that between the 1st and 30th day, there'll be a very different scent. 
I'd also like to point out that I didn't take the extra essence that people recommend. I'll see when I next order!

Yesterday I cleaned my bike, including the chain, drove it home lightly for about 5 minutes and only then I sprayed some Ipone chain lube on it. I admit I might have sprayed a decent amount of chain lube more than I usually do, I don't know why tho.

This morning I rode my bike to a coffee spot and only after the coffee when I approached it I noticed this dark spill. When I arrived home I noticed that it was very very sticky so I assumed it was the excess chain lube I sprayed on it. But still I don't know why is it so dark since I literally rode like almost 10km total after lubing it, so I thought maybe could it be a blown O-ring from the chain?

Also looking at the last picture is it normal that the chain links are a bit crooked? They can still be rotated obviously by hand with what I think is a decent amount of force, so do I maybe need to replace the chain?",5,1749302278.0,motorcycles,9,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 28-year-old male who recently ended a relationship, and this is my first time seeking a relationship while being open about my sexuality. I installed Tinder, but there aren't many gay people in my city, which tends to be a bit conservative. Most of my matches are from a larger city that's about 60 km away. 

The problem is, I find myself carrying on conversations with matches from the other city. I feel that since they have many more options, they might not be interested in someone who lives so far away. 

One of the few people I liked in my city was a guy (23M) I had a crush on two years ago. At that time, I messaged him on Instagram to invite him for coffee, but he said he was too busy (without explicitly saying he wasn‚Äôt interested in me). I liked his profile on Tinder last week, but I haven‚Äôt matched with him yet. 

I‚Äôve considered creating a new profile to give him a super like or messaging him on Instagram again, but I‚Äôm worried about coming off as creepy. In my city, Grindr seems to mainly have people looking for sex, and I'm not in the mood for that.

I want to meet more people, but it feels like I don‚Äôt have many options in my city. There aren‚Äôt even any gay bars or other venues for gay folks. What can I do?",1,1749302198.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve only heard of ""glitch in the matrix"" stories from YouTube videos that read posts off Reddit. I never really fully believed them but I always wondered what it would feel like if something like that was real.

Well... I think it just happened to me.

I was coming back home after a picnic with my friends. I hadn‚Äôt slept much the night before and was planning to cancel, honestly, but I always do that, and this time I just wanted to show up. In the end, I did have fun. But the lack of sleep started to hit me hard by around 5 PM.

I took the metro back, and instead of catching an auto home like I usually do, I decided to walk. Thought it might help me beat the sleepiness. The road from the junction has restaurants and grocery stores on both sides, very familiar path. At one point, I have to take a turn to the right. There‚Äôs a chicken shop right there, and next to it is this grocery store called Farmface.

So I‚Äôm walking, scrolling through cat reels on my phone, when I catch the exact smell of hens. That nasty, specific smell that always comes from that chicken place. I instinctively look up and yep, there it is. The cages of chickens out front, and Farmface right beside them, glowing with its bright signage. I remember staring at the sign for a second, trying to remember if I had to grab anything for home. I was so tempted to get a coffee, but I knew if I gave in, I‚Äôd just stay up even longer. I needed a shower and sleep. That was the plan.

So I take the turn.

A little ahead is a flower shop. I noticed they were unloading a bunch of plants from a truck. That caught my attention because they don‚Äôt always do that. I made a quick mental note to remind my dad about getting new plants for the house. The smell in that spot is usually like muddy and leaves, earthy and kinda comforting.

I kept walking, still on my phone.

And then, out of nowhere, I get the chicken smell again.

The flower shop usually smells like wet, cold mud and green stuff, not hens. So I look up‚Äî

Farmface.

Again.

Chickens.

Same glowing sign. Same smell. Same spot.

My heart dropped. I had already passed this. I know this stretch of road by heart. I didn‚Äôt turn back. I didn‚Äôt loop around. I just kept walking straight. And yet... there I was again, at the exact same place.

I was panicking inside at this point. My heartbeat was loud that I could literally hear it in my ears. I was trying to think of a logical explanation but nothing made sense.

To test if I was losing it, I took the same right turn again.

And sure enough, the same flower shop was unloading the same plants from the same truck. Same moment. 

I have no idea what happened. Maybe I was just too sleep deprived. But I swear on everything, I did not walk back. I didn‚Äôt turn around. I kept walking straight..

I‚Äôve walked that road a hundred times.

Mother‚Äôs Day has been rough for us the past few years. I had a 2nd trimester miscarriage in May of ‚Äò23, and then my MIL passed away in March last year. So this is the 2nd Mother‚Äôs Day after her passing but last year it was still really fresh. So I knew my first Mother‚Äôs Day would also be a complicated one for my husband. His sister & her family planned a trip to visit us over that weekend, and that was totally fine by me. A few weeks in advance I checked in with him about how he was feeling and said that I wanted to be celebrated by him during the season of Mother‚Äôs Day but it didn‚Äôt have to be on that specific day, given his mom‚Äôs passing and his sister‚Äôs visit. I thought I was clear though that I wanted him to do SOMETHING at SOME POINT.

A couple weeks pass and finally I ask directly if he has anything planned. He says he wants to do something but can‚Äôt think of anything. I give him some suggestions (like write me a heartfelt note / card, do something with a picture of our child or her hand print). I suggested he ask my mom or a friend for help. Now it‚Äôs almost Father‚Äôs Day and I brought it up AGAIN. He said he ‚Äúthinks about it every day and feels bad because he doesn‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù 

There is an entire industry around Mother‚Äôs Day. I get that gift giving can be hard but like‚Ä¶you couldn‚Äôt even do the obvious softball of getting me flowers or a card or a fancy coffee??

We worked so hard to become parents and now I‚Äôm finally a mom. I wanted to celebrate that and feel celebrated by him specifically.

It's been a common trend ever since that she's disappointed about everything and she always vocalizes that. She's from a country in Eastern Europe and complains that everything here in Toronto is almost terrible. There isn't any single good coffee anywhere here. Food as well is just disgusting for her. I've tried bringing her to all of the good places even the ones I did research on in different sites and even reddit. 

It's also always been an issue with money because our spending has been quite a lot. I believe I spent $15-20k in the last 2 years of our relationship racked up in credit card debt. She does help out every once in a while but the bulk of those are just dates. She does admit that she still doesn't understand the value of money and it hurts when I bought her an expensive pair of Blundstone boots worth $300, it was like nothing to her.

I only make $64K a year in Toronto and it's average at best. I feel like I'm honestly grateful to be earning a livable wage but every complaint from her just feels heavy now especially when she talks about her friend dating a pilot or her other friend who is always traveling all over the world while being sponsored by men of a certain age. 

On another note, she often shouts or raises her voice when we're outside. She says it's a normal part in her country but I do say that she's not living there anymore and I don't live there and I'm not from there. Whenever she shouts I always remember my childhood from being verbally abused. Still happens a lot and whenever I talk about what I feel, she's always tired or annoyed about it. 

I feel like there's a lot more I can share. I'm typing this as I woke up and couldn't sleep. We're currently in a cottage trip for the weekend and she's already complaining yesterday how cold everything is and how it is being in the outdoors. I feel like there's no hope but I want to hear advice from people. Please ask questions. What can I do?",1,1749301902.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

¬† ‚ÄúOh, no, no, no, no, no!‚Äù Haley murmured in disbelief as she watched her pink, white, and yellow tulips being yanked viciously out of the ground. She shoved back from her computer desk and stormed towards the front door. She was going to kill him this time there was no doubt about it.  
After five long years of juvenile nonsense he‚Äôd finally gone too far. Her college roommate hadn‚Äôt even been able to aggravate her this much, even when she went through her six month period of not showering, or using deodorant to ‚Äúsave the planet.  Five years ago she‚Äôd been proud to buy her first house at the ripe old age of twenty-four. She'd worked her butt off to buy her dream home, a one level two bedroom ranch. The experience of owning her own home was better than anything she could have ever imagined. She spent countless hours picking out the perfect color scheme for each room, cleaning, organizing, and hitting every yard sale within a thirty mile radius, trying to turn wood and plaster into a real home. None of that work could even begin to compare to the countless hours she spent on her lawn and garden. With countless blisters, cuts, bee stings and back aches she turned her dull yard into a paradise. Her enjoyment lasted for all of four months. That‚Äôs when he moved into the house next door. At first she was excited to have a neighbor, one that wasn‚Äôt elderly and well, cranky. All of her enjoyment ended the moment she met Jason Bradford. Within the first ten minutes of his arrival he‚Äôd backed into her mailbox, spilled fast food wrappers from his car onto his property, which quickly made their way onto her immaculate lawn, and relieved himself on the great old oak tree in his front lawn with a sheepish smile and a shrug in her horrified direction.  
The man was a barbarian. For the next five years he turned her picturesque life into a nightmare. She wasn‚Äôt sure how one person managed to take so much control over her happiness, but he did. Over the years she dealt with paintball pellets decorating the laundry hanging on her clothesline and the side of her house, loud music, parties, twice she found na\*\*d people trying to climb the fence to skinny dip in her pool, three a. m. drunken basketball games, women throwing hissy fits on his front lawn and sometimes on hers when the jerk refused to come out and deal with them.  
  
¬† What made it worse was that they both worked at the same private high school, in the same department, with adjoining classrooms, and parking spots. It didn‚Äôt take long for him to turn her dream job and house into a nightmare. At work she had to deal with him constantly ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù things from her room like paper, pens, books, and even her desk one time.  
  
¬† He seemed to think he was the most charming man on earth and had no problem with using it to get his way, leaving her with extra work and responsibilities while he got to be the laid back teacher. It didn‚Äôt take her long to figure out that she would have to suck it up at work. There was no way at her age she was going to be able to land a better job. She'd been lucky to land this one. So the only option left for her was to move.  
  
¬† After the first year she tried to sell her house, unsuccessfully. Every time a prospective buyer came around he scared them off by just being Jason. She gave up the idea of selling her house for the next two years and put it up again last year when he took up golf and shot out three of her windows. After he managed to scare off fifteen prospective buyers by walking out to get the mail in his boxers, a particularly memorable fit of rage when he threw his computer out the window accompanied with a loud roar, and of course there was the upkeep or rather lack thereof of his property.  
  
¬† His lawn was covered in crab grass and weeds. He only paid the neighborhood kid to mow it once a month. The rest of the time it was the chosen habitat of little woodland creatures. The house needed a serious paint job, or at the very least a cleanup of all paint chips that had fallen to the ground over the years. If he didn‚Äôt personally scare someone off his house did the job. She gave up the dream of moving away five months ago and settled for praying that he would move soon, very soon.  
  
¬† Now he was going after her babies. This was not happening. Enough was enough. Over the last five years she bit her tongue, too afraid to complain. She‚Äôd always been like that, even as a little kid.  
  
¬† She was always the shy quiet girl with her nose buried in a book, hoping no one would notice her. It wasn‚Äôt so much that she wasn‚Äôt a very social person, she was. It had more to do with the fact that she was a huge chicken. When the other kids picked on her or pushed her around she cowered, unable to deal with confrontation. That nasty habit followed her into adulthood.  
  
¬† It was made even worse with good looking men like Jason. His ebony hair, ocean blue eyes and chiseled good looks made her nervous. She just wasn‚Äôt any good at handling people. Throw good looks onto a guy that was being particularly jerkish and she turned into a blubbering idiot. Pushy people just sucked and it really sucked that she never learned how to deal with them.  
  
¬† When she caught her roommate stealing her papers, food, and money what did she do? She avoided her room until well after two in the morning when she knew Angel would be asleep and then hurried the hell out of there before she woke up in the morning. The same could be said when the few boyfriends she did manage to have over the years took advantage of her.  
  
¬† Instead of throwing them to the curb like she should have done she pulled back into herself, knowing they would get bored eventually and move on. Yes, she was a chicken. That was the only reason why Jason Bradford had gotten away with his behavior for the past five years. No more. The flowers were the last straw. Her grandmother had given her the bulbs from her own garden when she bought the house and she loved them.  
  
¬† She spied the rolled up hose and made a snap decision. This ended here and now. The days of being the world‚Äôs biggest pushover were over.  
What the hell!‚Äù  
  
¬† Jason jumped to his feet as a torrent of ice cold water hit him.  
  
¬† He didn‚Äôt know what he expected to see, but it certainly wasn‚Äôt his timid little neighbor and co-worker aiming her very long hose at him. Clearly she‚Äôd lost her damned mind.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStep away from my tulips,‚Äù she ordered in a tone of authority.  
  
¬† He really couldn‚Äôt help grinning at her. She looked so damn cute standing there with her long bronze hair pulled back into a twisted pony tail, green eyes full of fire hidden behind large glasses making her look adorable, and of course her rather tight black tee shirt with the word ‚ÄúNerd‚Äù written across her very decent size chest made her look rather hot. His eyes dropped to the cute little shorts that revealed short, but very nice curvy tanned legs, very nice indeed.  
  
¬† Of course he knew his quiet neighbor was stunning. It was the first thing he noticed about her the day he moved in. The second, she was a very shy, very nervous, easily frightened female. He still winced when he thought back to that day. After five hours on the road and three giant gulps he was in desperate need of a bathroom. Unfortunately the realtor hadn't left the keys where she said she would and he had to make a split second decision, piss his pants or water the tree. In the end the tree got a healthy amount of recycled cola.  
  
¬† She hadn't even given him a chance to explain or apologize. Her face reddened before she practically ran into her house. From then on she avoided him at all costs. If he waved or said hello to her she would mutter something or ignore him. If he or one of his ass\*\*le buddies broke something on her property she didn‚Äôt say a word. If he was a jerk he could have easily gotten away with not paying for all those broken windows or paintball streaked sheets, but he wasn't that big of a prick. He learned she would never speak up for herself so as soon as the shit hit the fan he made a call and replaced whatever he f\*\*ked up. It would just make him fee  
l like an even bigger ass\*\*le to take advantage of the situation.

It always bothered him that she never spoke up. He couldn‚Äôt remember someone disliking him so fast and intensely before in his life. No matter what he did she couldn‚Äôt be bothered to speak to him. Hell, he would have kicked his ass years ago, or at least called the cops on him like the other neighbors did or file a complaint with the principal like so many of his other co-workers had. Hell, she never even signed any of those numerous petitions the rest of the neighborhood liked to give him every few months. He checked each and every time.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt like he was purposely being an ass\*\*le. It just came naturally to him. Everyone understood and accepted it. Probably because even though he was an ass\*\*le, he was a likeable ass\*\*le‚Ä¶. . most of the time.  
  
¬† As happy as he was that she finally came off her throne to talk to him he was also pissed to be soaked to the bone in his favorite shirt and khaki shorts in seventy degree weather. Apparently he didn‚Äôt move fast enough because she sprayed him again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you f\*\*king insane?‚Äù he demanded.  
  
¬† She gestured with the hose for him to take a step back. ‚ÄúGet away from my flower bed‚Ä¶. . Now. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour flowerbed?‚Äù he asked in disbelief.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, my flowerbed!‚Äù Another short spray. ‚ÄúI planted these flowers five years ago, before you moved in!‚Äù  
  
¬† Jason ran frustrated fingers through his messy hair. ‚ÄúThen you should have checked the f\*\*king property lines before you wasted your time!‚Äù he snapped.  
  
¬† Her eyes narrowed on him. ‚ÄúThe flowerbed is my property!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, sweetheart. Go check your deed if you don‚Äôt believe me. This flowerbed is one hundred percent on my property,‚Äù he said harshly. He pointed to the two feet of space that separated their houses where the flower bed continued until it came to the large wooden picket fence that started at the corner of her house and continued to the back, separating their backyards. ‚ÄúYou have five inches from the wall of your house out. Your property ends two inches before my flower bed! That‚Äôs why the stupid little white picket fence starts against your house instead of on the other side of the flowerbed. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He watched as she glared at the small space that separated their houses. Whoever built their houses was a real prick. Both of their master bedrooms were built less than two feet apart. Yet, there was more than thirty feet of space between each house and the other neighboring houses. There was no privacy with the way the identical houses were designed. He had no choice but to place his large bed directly at the window and from what he could see neither had she. Taking the smaller bedroom was out of the question. His bed would never fit in it.  
  
¬† It felt odd sleeping less than two feet away from a woman who thought him less than dirt. During the summer they both refused to open their windows until the heat became oppressive, leaving them with no other choice. Forget about bringing a woman to his bedroom. He‚Äôd never been one for PDA‚Äôs never mind ha\*\*ng s\*x in public and ha\*\*ng s\*x in his room would definitely feel like a public performance.  
  
¬† No matter how many times he tried to remind himself that they were in separate houses and separated by more than just a stupid little flower garden he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to allow a woman in his bed. Not that he did that normally. He never invited a woman to his home. That was one of his top ten rules of dating. The only time they ever came to his house was to bitch him out when he moved on and that was done from the outside.  
  
¬† He never in his entire adult life shared a bed with a woman. That was too much intimacy and sent the wrong message. The few times he made the mistake of relaxing in a woman‚Äôs bed after a quick lay proved to be serious mistakes. They wanted to coddle and always asked the questions that made him cringe, ‚ÄúWhat are you thinking?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo you love me?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere do you see this going?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAre you as happy as I am?‚Äô, ""Why do you keep calling me by my sister's name?"", or his personal favorite ‚ÄúI wonder what our babies will look like. ‚Äù No, sex was best kept at a woman‚Äôs house, hotel room or better yet in the backseat of a car.  
  
¬† Thank god his neighbor seemed to share the same attitude. He hated the idea of waking up to the sounds of another man grunting and moaning. With his luck the sounds would filter into his dream and he would end up having a g\*y dream. Thankfully that never happened otherwise he‚Äôd be sleeping on his couch.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt as if his beautiful neighbor was without male attention. He‚Äôd seen several losers sniffing around her in the last five years. She was easily out of their league, at least physically. Personality wise, well even from afar he could tell they were all pricks. He wasn‚Äôt a prince, not by any measure, but he found himself eager to deck a few of them over the years with the way they treated her. They never hit her, otherwise he would have killed the bastards. He didn‚Äôt go for hitting a woman no matter what. Sometimes he felt like they were using her, or not treating her right. He didn‚Äôt know why he cared, he just did.  
  
¬† Haley eyed the fence and then the remaining length of the flower bed. She sighed heavily. ‚ÄúFine. If I made a mistake I‚Äôm sorry. I replaced the last flower bed with the tulips. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He nodded in relief, glad that it was settled. The damn flowers were out of here and not a moment too soon. He couldn‚Äôt take another night like last night. Besides he was running out of cornstarch.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just move the flowers over into my five inches of space,‚Äù she announced.  
  
¬† His eyes widened with that announcement. ‚ÄúThe hell you will!‚Äù  
  
¬† Chapter 2  
  
¬† Haley‚Äôs eyes widened in total disbelief as Jason threw himself back onto the plants, tearing them up like a man possessed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù she shrieked. He ignored her and continued to rip the tulips from the ground, making sure those damn bulbs came with them. He tossed them far onto his property so she couldn‚Äôt get her hands on them to re-plant them.  
  
¬† She squeezed the nozzle, sending a full blast of cold water on him. Still he continued to tear up the flowerbed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop! Please stop!‚Äù she cried. He only slowed down when he reached the tight space between their houses.  
  
¬† Jason had to shift his shoulders so he could lodge himself into the tight space. Thankfully she gave up on squirting him. It might be April, but they were in New England and that meant a bright sun with a cold breeze. His body shivered violently as he reached forward to grab handfuls of tulips. Suddenly something clamped around his ankles.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat the hell-omph!‚Äù He was pulled off balance, landing face first into the thick mud she created with her little water meltdown. Before he could push himself up she was crawling over his back to get to those damn flowers.  
  
¬† Haley used her small frame to her advantage. After quickly crawling over Jason she began digging up as many tulips with her hands as she could and setting them gently, yet quickly, against the side of her house.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey! Stop that!‚Äù he demanded as he leaned over her to grab her hands.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGet off of me!‚Äù she snapped, digging faster.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be on you if you weren‚Äôt on my damn property!‚Äù  
  
¬† She threw back an elbow to dislodge him. He cursed under his breath as he pushed himself in further until her entire body was snuggled tightly beneath his. She instantly froze beneath him. He took advantage of her stunned reaction and grabbed as many flowers as he could.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI said get off me, not crush me!‚Äù she clarified. It was all she could do to control her breathing. She was going to hyperventilate and pass out. No doubt about it. A large muscular man was on top of her!

Her senses went into overload as she tried to focus. But all she could think about was how the feel of his strong hard stomach felt pressed against her back. Suddenly a shiver shot through her body that had nothing to do with the cold water seeping through her clothes.  
  
¬† Then realization sank in. A very large man was on top of her! ‚ÄúThat better not be what I think it is,‚Äù she hissed between clenched teeth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not. ‚Äù It was. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt flatter yourself, sweetheart,‚Äù he snapped, trying not to groan or grind into her. He was a little shocked himself. Not that he ever had a problem getting it up. He didn‚Äôt. Of course these days his interest in sex had waned a bit. Hell, he couldn‚Äôt remember the last time he had sex, which in itself was pathetic.  
  
¬† He made a half ass attempt to pull out more flowers. That seemed to distract her enough from her pert little ass being snuggled against his lap. His eyes closed as he nuzzled his face against her neck and inhaled slowly. She didn‚Äôt seem to notice so he did it again. He would swear on his life that she smelled like blackberries and cream. It was damn enticing.  
  
¬† She groaned her irritation. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what your problem is. I made a mistake planting them on your property. Just let me move them over a few inches and everything will be settled. ‚Äù  
  
¬† That snapped him out of his daze. ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù He reached past her and began ripping flowers out. She swore under her breath as she crawled out from under him to save whatever flowers she could. He simply followed her, assuming the same position each time and frustrating the hell out of her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being a jerk! I just want my bulbs!‚Äù she said, trying to not to cry. These were her Grandmother‚Äôs bulbs. Her Grandfather bought them for her after the war to celebrate the success of their first business.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not going to plant them here! They can‚Äôt stay!‚Äù he said, digging faster.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù she demanded, coming closer and closer to frustrated tears. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand you! You do nothing with your property at all. Why do you care if there‚Äôs a flower bed here or a few inches over? They‚Äôre not hurting you!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe hell they‚Äôre not!‚Äù he snapped, thinking of all the spots on his back and neck that still throbbed.  
  
¬† She scoffed. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just flowers. What could they possibly do to aggravate you to this level?‚Äù She heard a buzzing pass her ear and absently waved it off.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBees!‚Äù he said, trying to back up, but couldn‚Äôt. His large frame was trapped between their houses.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs a bee,‚Äù she said slowly as if she were talking to a child.  
  
¬† He groaned as he tried to twist his large frame loose. When that didn't work he tried to shove backwards. His arm snaked around her waist, trying to pull her along with him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, get your hands-‚Äú  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a f\*\*king nest and we just disturbed it!‚Äù he yelled.  
  
¬† Haley‚Äôs eyes shot forward and then widened. Sure enough, two feet in front of her the end of what appeared to be a very large ground nest was now poking out of the ground thanks to the flowers they yanked up. Yellow jackets began swarming just above the nest. It wouldn‚Äôt be long before they descended on them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMove!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt!‚Äù  
  
¬† Haley clenched her teeth as she slammed back as hard as she could against him. He groaned low in her ear, but didn‚Äôt stop trying to move back. She moved forward and slammed back again, and again. Each time was met by a groan and a gain of a few inches.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOne more time!‚Äù he grated out.  
  
¬† She moved forward and this time when she slammed back into him she pushed up with her shoulders, dislodging him. Jason used the momentum to pull them both back several feet. He kept his arm snaked around her waist as he dragged her away from the nest.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre swarming!‚Äù Haley cried.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShit!‚Äù Jason looked frantically around for a safe place.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy house!‚Äù she said, gesturing wildly towards her front door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood idea,‚Äù he said as he ran towards the house, dragging her along. The buzzing sound became louder and louder as the swarm began circling them. Once they reached the front door he opened it, relieved that she'd left it unlocked, and they ran inside, slamming the door shut behind them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBees!‚Äù Haley cried, gesturing to the bees that had followed them inside.  
  
¬† He quickly released her and grabbed two magazines from a small pile on a coffee table and threw one to her. Without a word they rolled the magazines up and began to attack the dozen or so bees that managed to follow them inside. Neither spoke until the last bee was squashed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFive nights‚Ä¶. in‚Ä¶. a‚Ä¶. row‚Ä¶. . stung‚Ä¶,‚Äù Jason bit out while he tried to catch his breath.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou knew there were yellow jackets and you still tore up the flowers?‚Äù she asked in disbelief. Her grandmother had taught her well. A ground nest was not something to mess with. It could be as small as a stack or quarters or several feet long.  
  
¬† Jason gestured in the direction of his house. ‚ÄúI was trying to kill them. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She shook her head in disbelief. He knew there was a nest and he didn‚Äôt tell her?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me there was a nest? You know I work in that flowerbed,‚Äù she said, working hard on keeping her tone even. They could have been killed!  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI did!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, you didn‚Äôt!‚Äù  
  
¬† He threw his hands up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to tell you for last few weeks, but each time I approached you, you ran off!‚Äù  
  
¬† She opened her mouth to argue, but shut it as quickly and winced. Yeah, that really did sound like something she would do where he was concerned. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she finally said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, oh,‚Äù he snapped. He peeked out the window and groaned. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still swarming. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Haley sighed. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to be a problem for a few hours. We need to call an exterminator. ‚Äù  
  
¬† \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
¬† Man he was freezing. He was soaked to the bone and it didn‚Äôt look like he was going to be able to go to his house anytime soon to change. Normally he‚Äôd strip down to his boxers, but his neighbor was already skittish around him. He didn‚Äôt want to give the poor thing a stroke. He looked down at her very clean and obviously well cared for wood floor and cringed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShit, maybe I should step out the back and dry off,‚Äù he said as he raised his eyes to look into her adjoining kitchen. His brows flew up as he watched the windows darken.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that will be happening for a while,‚Äù Haley said softly as she rubbed her forehead. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go take a shower and I‚Äôll see if I can find you something to wear. While you‚Äôre taking your shower I‚Äôll call for an exterminator. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre sure,‚Äù he said, hoping she wouldn‚Äôt change her mind. He was freezing his balls off. Hell, at this point he‚Äôd squeeze his ass into a dress to get warm.  
  
¬† She nodded absently as she watched the bees swarm around her backyard. ‚ÄúYeah, let me show you where the bathroom is. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Ten minutes later the shivering finally stopped and he was really enjoying his shower. Never in his life had hot water felt so good. This was the best shower ever. It didn‚Äôt hurt that his little shy neighbor shared his appreciation for the simple things in life like a normal bar of soap and none of that overly perfumed expensive shit that never lathered properly and always left a rash on his skin. It also didn‚Äôt hurt that the bathroom looked like a bathroom and wasn‚Äôt covered from head to toe in lace and makeup. This was a bathroom a man could comfortably use without worrying about his masculinity.",1,1749301891.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I started semiglutide at the end of January. I have had a lifetime of rollercoaster weight loss and gain. I am excellent at losing weight but even better at gaining it right back. I have never in my life been able to maintain a healthy weight. Ever. I‚Äôve lost 100 lbs twice and gained it back twice. And rollercoastered up and down the rest of the time. It is maddening and has been an ongoing, lifetime obsession that I am sick of. 

And my food noise has always been relentless and when I would be in a healthier place/wight my food noise would morph into exercise/macro noise in an unhealthy way- ‚Äúyou need more steps!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou need to workout longer!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt hit protein goal!‚Äù and on and on and on. I was the person that would do laps around my living room before bed, to exceed my step goal and for what!? As a side note, I was diagnosed with OCD years ago and I‚Äôve always felt like some of my food noise was related to OCD rumination. 

Semiglutide was terrible for me. I didn‚Äôt sleep, had zero energy/the worst fatigue I‚Äôve ever experienced, sulfur burps, was bloated, felt mildly depressed, noticed zero progress on food noise, had a high HR, and lost minimal weight. I lost a little but I think because I was so desperate for it to work, I was making healthier choices but was losing my mind because the hunger/food noise was still there, full force. 

Thankfully, in April, my doc switched me to Zep 7.5 and omg it changed my life. My HR is lower, overall I‚Äôm sleeping more soundly, the food noise isn‚Äôt gone but it‚Äôs noticeably better, finally have a normal appetite and I‚Äôve lost a bit of weight. 

So my questions are: 
1) once I actually hit my goal- how will I know when to start maintenance? 
2) Did you all hit your goal weight and then try to maintain that for x weeks, before starting a maintenance dose? 
3) Did you try to shoot for UNDER your goal, so you‚Äôd have some wiggle room? 
4) I‚Äôm on the 10mg dose right now and have wondered since 10mg helps so much with the OCD/food noise, maybe going up again will completely end that but is that realistic? 

I know maintaining the weight loss will be my biggest challenge because I‚Äôve never been successful with it. I already know I will be on this med for as long as I can, because it helps so much with the food noise/mental health side of it. Plus, as an unexpected bonus, I went from 5 cups of coffee a day to 1. I‚Äôm not compulsively shopping anymore. My mind feels a little more relaxed, in general.

It started with this guy, totally engrossed in his food, then he suddenly stiffened. I saw him oggling at a girl who just walked in with a friend. 
She wasn't even that good looking tbh.
They found a spot near Hamleys, and he was directly opposite.
They crossed paths near the food counters, and I caught a couple of quick eye contacts followed by a small weird smile from her. The guy just froze, then went back to his table, looking absolutely glued to his Burger King coffee which tastes like absolut cr@p.. I mean who orders coffee at a burger cafe.

The girl walked over to the counter‚Äîright by his table‚Äîand ordered fries. She was practically within arm's reach, but he was a pussy.  His coffee suddenly became the most fascinating object in the mall. What a nerd. üòÜ
Then, the unexpected happened. She actually approached his table and asked whether she could sit there. The guy nearly sh@t his pants, but he managed to nod.
The first thing she said was something about not liking the coffee there (duh), and then the guy, tried to flirt. ""Yeah, I thought the coffee would be as creamy as your eyes,"" he blurted out. I almost choked on my soda. It was a seriously cringey line, but to my surprise, she actually laughed and even blushed a little! I was like ..What the hell

She started talking about some charity stuff where she's currently working and about how some kid in some village needs his 500 rupees for their education. She sweet talked him into giving her a 500 rs note and the moment she got money, BAM, her friend comes out of nowhere and takes her away. I guess they got their movie budget for the evening.  The poor guy sat there with his dreamy eyes not knowing that a sneaky girl just tricked him into giving money.
Anyways, as all these drama was happening, I was just sitting there in an adjacent table and munching on pizza knowing fully that this Sh!t is going to shoot my cholesterol up in the sky.",7,1749301702.0,vadodara,5,0.89,False

Better Goods is Walmart‚Äôs premium in-house brand, and so far, everything I‚Äôve tried from the line has held up‚ÄîI'd say it's comparable to Trader Joe‚Äôs quality, which is saying something.

The Sumatra roast in particular is rich, smooth, and well-balanced. It‚Äôs got depth without any bitterness, and it avoids that burnt, overly dark edge you often get with Starbucks ground coffee. It‚Äôs just a nice, mellow cup that feels like it costs more than it does.

At $7.77 for a 12 oz bag, it‚Äôs an excellent value. If you‚Äôre looking for a grocery store coffee that feels a little more elevated without going full boutique, this one‚Äôs worth a try.

I use the Melita single cup pour over.

Bellevue:

Farine Bakery & Cafe (boss's recc)

Mecury's Coffee 

Bellden Cafe

Cactus Bellevue

Skillet Diner at Capital Hill (takes reservations)

Solarium Kitchen & Bar (takes res)

  
Seattle

Mr. West's Cafe Downtown

  
Dang I thought I had more in Seattle, he was open to a mix of both. He lives in Bellevue and works in Seattle and wants to alternate. This will be a monthly breakfast so I am hoping for a pretty big list that can work for our needs.

Now he had like a group of friends , and like I had a cousin there aswell , but more like dur ke rishtedar types, and she was very introvert, and I was pretty bored, but then his friends they were playing cricket , so they invited me, I gladly accepted! I had a great time, now as I was heading my room, I wanted something from my suitcase, but my brother he did the stupidest thing, he changed the password and then forgot it!

So I was panicking so one of the groom's friend A came and he helped me unlock that by a yt tutorial, and now here enters the main guy about whom this post is about , let's say B. So A is very focused in unlocking and be is just doing nothing and chatting with my brother, basically doing nothing. And then he tries to initiate a small talk with me. Now I didn't mind it tbh , but he looked like he was my age , atleast that's what I thought that he is brother of my cousin's friend. So we talked little bit. Now this guy next day out of nowhere starts bringing me things like water, sweets and and just finding reasons to talk to me. I didn't really mind, cuz I was like yeah he's just being nice.

Now the wedding day, so during the barat, ofc everyone was dancing, but he was also tryna get close not very close cuz like I had my mum and aunt , but like he was close , eye contact and stuff. But then he wasn't my problem my problem was that in barat there was this random uncle who I did not even know and he was just staring at me for like 15 mins , almost all the wayy. I was stressed about that, contemplating whether to tell mom ignore and just stare back in his soul, but I chose middle option. Then we finnaly reached the venue, that mf was still staring. So I told B that there's this weird guy, and he's just staring, he was yeah ignore n stuff, but I was like fine cuz I just had to share with someone. Then when we got in B went straight to the guy, and got in a argument with him , it lasted for like 3-4 mins, I couldn't even go stop him cuz my family was there. But yeah B came back and he was like he won't do that again, and I was like you did not had to do that, but yeah it ended there.

Then B was being all caring n stuff, like he complimented many times my hair and dress and stuff. and basically I was again bored so I was hanging out with him and other friends. It was chilly , and we decided to sit somewhere and as you know , the chairs were wet, it was an open venue, so he took he coat and cleaned the chair and was like sit. Ab yeh jada ho raha tha. But eventually we just started walking, I got myself a icecream , but like I was already stuffed as I had starters, so I ate like half and I was gonna throw the rest, and this guy he asked are you throwing it away , and I'm like yeah I'm stuffed. And he's like do you mind if I have it? Now I was stunned, and I did not know what to say, so I'm like but this is half eaten, and he's like that's the best part with a wink, and he took it. I was flabbergasted atp, but yeah then mom called me for pics and stuff.

Had dinner now again I did not take a lot, but like little rice was left, and he legit again came and sat beside me, he's like ur not eating? Can I ? I'm like sir ? wtf ? no ofc I did not say that but that was my inner monologue. But my mom was just beside me, I cannot risk it, so I'm like yeah I'll eat that in a while, you get yourself dinner. And now all were just leaving, like goodbyes n stuff was happening, again he came and sat beside me, And just mentioned that it's quite chilly, and I kid you not that guy, he starts removing his coat!üò≠ My family is literally beside me, so I deny him that it's fine and stuff and we leave.

Now next morning, I came late so ofc I slept till late , and he brings me coffee. Now imagine I woke up like 5 secs ago and he's next to me all ready and stuff, And just woke up! I'm embarrassed, but yeah I said thank you and went to take a shower. That day I had to leave . We had like a small talk , and then he told me he's 24! Like all this while I was like he's 18 but no! I was surprised but then I'm like nvm. So like after few hours I leave, and he did not come to say goodbye or anything and he did not ask for my number or anything.

And after like an hour I get a hi, it was him, prolly got my number from family group. I did not really mind cuz I was toh leaving, then when I reached home in evening, I get so many messages from his girlfriend which he had denied, that he had no girlfriend and she's furious and angry, like some 12 msgs and then she blocks me! I mean that was the weirdest thing to ever happen ? The guy who was acting all caring and stuff had a girlfriend all this while !?

TLDR : met a guy at wedding , he was hitting on me the whole time and being all caring and stuff , and the end got to know he had a gf all this while and she blocked me.",2,1749301374.0,TeenIndia,11,1.0,False

This is obviously quite a shock and quick decline, we only brought him to the vet because he was drinking my glass of water on the coffee table but otherwise behaving normally.

I was 28 when I got matched with a guy through a matchmaker. We first met with both our families. He was a year younger than me, two inches shorter, and quite handsome. I consider myself good-looking too, but I‚Äôd never thought boys would be comfortable marrying someone taller. The fact that he seemed okay with it made me believe he was mature and confident ‚Äî and that impressed me.

We started texting, went on two more dates, and discussed everything under the sun ‚Äî likes, dislikes, values, goals. We seemed to match really well. On our second date, it was raining, we had a few drinks, and the mood turned romantic. We kissed. I was on cloud nine ‚Äî it felt like something real was blossoming.

The next morning, filled with a sense of hope and excitement, I messaged my mom saying, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs finalise him.‚Äù

But just an hour later, he texted: ‚ÄúI want to meet you again. There‚Äôs something important I need to tell you.‚Äù
I assumed it was the usual ‚Äî maybe some unfinished business with an ex. I even told him I wouldn‚Äôt mind if that was the case, but he insisted we talk in person.

By this time, I was already emotionally invested. I had butterflies every time he messaged. We met at a coffee shop. He looked serious and said, ‚ÄúI want to tell you something, but you can‚Äôt call off the impending marriage.‚Äù
I told him, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise that, but go ahead.‚Äù

Then he slid his phone toward me. On the screen was a medical report: he was heavily diabetic.
I was in complete shock. Not because diabetes is a dealbreaker in itself, but because of the timing. In the arranged marriage setup, where everything moves so quickly, transparency is everything. I‚Äôve had my fair share of disappointments in this process already ‚Äî this was one blow too many.

I wept. I left.

I felt ‚Äî and still feel ‚Äî foolish. Like he made me fall for him, and only after that decided to tell me the truth. I truly believe the right thing would have been to share this upfront, before the feelings, the kisses, and the dreams.

I‚Äôm not angry because he has a medical condition. I‚Äôm angry because I wasn‚Äôt given a fair choice. In a system where you‚Äôre expected to fall in love on a deadline, honesty becomes the bare minimum. And I didn‚Äôt get that.

Today, I‚Äôm left with frustration and a heavy heart. ",0,1749300475.0,Arrangedmarriage,9,0.5,False

I just came across Flamingo Crossings and this seems like a good spot, unless there‚Äôs a spot closer to Disney Springs that fits the bill with the same price! 

I‚Äôve combed through this sub quite a bit and various hotels sites, but I‚Äôd love to hear personal recommendations for where you‚Äôd stay as a family of 5 with kids 10, 8, and 2 (but he‚Äôll turn 3 when we get home, trying to squeeze that free entry in!) 

I‚Äôve been to Disney plenty as a kid. I remember staying at the Dolphin fondly. 

We‚Äôre looking at the last week of September for 5 nights. Unfortunately there are no deals on tickets or Disney hotels for that time, but maybe they‚Äôll be announced. We‚Äôre fixed on those days due to flight prices! 

Some things we‚Äôre looking for but are flexible on: 

-we‚Äôd prefer to not rent a car, so shuttle service to parks is ideal 

-a condo/kitchen would be great, but would need to be close to groceries! Saving money by making our own breakfast is enticing. 

-we don‚Äôt mind a Disney property if the price is right, but the All-Star resorts aren‚Äôt that appealing to me. Unless they come highly recommended?! 

-a fun pool for the kids on our non-park days is a must, but doesn‚Äôt need to be crazy with the slides! 

-walkability is perfect‚Äîmaybe trails around the property, pretty views, somewhere to grab coffee or dinner off-site


I really appreciate your help! There are so many to choose from.

Think about those moments where you're just waiting around, whether it's for your coffee to brew, a laundry cycle to finish, or even standing in line at the store. Those are golden opportunities to whip out your phone and create short videos. Yes, I mean videos.

Sure, you might feel silly at first, but the potential payoff can be much greater than you think. In a world where attention spans are short and engagement can lead to new opportunities, those quick videos could be the door to financial rewards that you're looking for.

So what happens at this meetup?

Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 7 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders -22:30). Currently we are averaging 15-25 people turning up.

Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?

No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.

Can I come along?

Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.

What if I don't want alcohol?

No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.

Since after the above people still asked...

I'm ********* is it OK if I come along?

We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Location/Time: Latymers, W6 8BS / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00

I want to cook someone's favorite meal.

I want to put my hands on his shoulder and maybe give him some back massage kapag sobrang dami nyang work.

Or prepare some midnight coffee and talk about random things, kung pano ba dapat labanan ang mga zombie, or kung gusto ba naming lumaban in the first place.

I want to sweet dance in the kitchen with him and maybe do some little kisses while we're at it.

I want learn new things for him, his hobbies and what interest him so when we talk about it, I will see this glow in his eyes na para bang nakahanap sya ng bestfriend ulet.

I want to be the ""ok lang yan, may work naman ako, may savings naman tayo. I can take care of us kung gusto mo munang magpahinga saglit. Go and take your deserve rest kase buong buhay mo naman ikaw nagtatrabaho."" woman in his life.

I want to make a garden in front of our house, para every other day, I can give him fresh flowers, coz i know sometimes, men only receives flowers in their funeral. I won't let that happen.

I want to dance in the rain with him. Fall in love with him all over again while the world seems not to care.

I want to travel the world and see it's beauty in his eyes.

I want to show him off sa lahat.
Lowkey but never private.

I want to send him memes and funny videos. And be able to make him laugh with the silly jokes and korni punch lines I've been memorizing for him all my life.

I want to make love with him, maybe stare into his eyes while we both run out of breath, whispering I love you and how lucky I am to have him. ~ and maybe kung gaano sya kasarap. üòõ

Until our last breath.
Until my last daldal runs out.

I still don't know if I need it, or if it just makes life and practice so much fucking easier that I can't imagine going back to how it was before I got it.

I got through law school without Vivance or Adderal, and I graduated in the top 10%. But it was more than hard: it demanded that I sacrifice almost everything else I had to achieve that level of focus and sustained attention. I was drinking 2 pots of coffee a day, and I was in a frantic mania of balancing this chaos of needs and wants and requirements. By the time I got to studying for the Bar, I amped up the sacrifice and focus and I felt like life was truly unsustainable now.

Passed the Bar, got hired on in P.I. Mill stuff and spent so much time just staring at 80 cases of tasks and 160 failures of the attorneys before me whose aborted, fucked up cases I had inherited. You can literally see the point in case development when the prior attorney said, I just can't, dude: I'm out of gas, and I could see why. I'm out, too.

So I told my therapist about all my ""symptoms"" that barely anyone else will understand are truly not ""my symptoms"" but are the symptoms of a profession that has become too nuanced and unweildy. Then all the sudden I take the Vivance and I'm not frozen through inundation. I'm eating the elephant, one bite at a time, and I don't really know if I have ADHD or not, but it feels like I do.

I think I'm writing this for those of you who might be thinking like I did.

Not a spooky whisper or distorted voices saying things like ‚Äúget out.‚Äù Just a regular voicemail. From my own number.

‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs me. Don‚Äôt freak out. I know this is gonna sound insane, but I need you to listen carefully.‚Äù

I froze. My blood felt like syrup. It was my voice. My cadence, my phrasing, even that annoying sniff I do before I talk.

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not you. Not exactly.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember the rest. I dropped my phone halfway through, my hand trembling, a metallic taste flooding my mouth. I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.

The next morning, I tried to play it again, but it was gone. Not deleted. Gone. Like it never existed. But I remember every word.

At first, I thought I was losing it. Stress from work, lack of sleep, maybe a psychotic break. My therapist said the same. I even took a week off to rest and reset. That‚Äôs when things got worse.

I started noticing changes in my apartment. Small at first. Coffee cups in the sink I didn‚Äôt use. The thermostat set two degrees higher than I ever put it. My toothpaste squeezed from the middle, which I never do.

Then, my neighbor waved at me. ‚ÄúHey, man! Sorry again about the noise last night.‚Äù

I stared blankly. ‚ÄúWhat noise?‚Äù

He frowned. ‚ÄúThe music? You were blasting that 80s playlist at midnight. You okay?‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt played any music. I hadn‚Äôt even been home that night‚ÄîI‚Äôd spent it at my brother‚Äôs house.

That‚Äôs when I checked the building‚Äôs security cam.

I watched myself walk into the building. Laughing. Carrying groceries. Even nodding at the front desk guy.

But I wasn‚Äôt there.

I stopped going outside. Changed my locks. Covered every reflective surface in my apartment. I didn‚Äôt want to see it again.

Because one night I did. Just a glimpse.

I was brushing my teeth when I looked up, and my reflection‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt brushing.

He was staring.

Not even blinking. Just a wide, flat smile. A smile that didn‚Äôt belong on my face.

I punched the mirror. I bloodied my knuckles. I slept on the floor with the lights on.

A few days later, I got a call from my mother. She sounded cheerful. ‚ÄúIt was so good seeing you today. You looked healthy. Finally.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. ‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt left the apartment in days.‚Äù

Silence.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that,‚Äù she said softly, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt scare me like that.‚Äù

She hung up.

Then came the job termination email. I hadn‚Äôt shown up for two weeks, they said. But apparently, I had. And I‚Äôd been‚Ä¶ amazing.

‚ÄúConfident, funny, focused.‚Äù My boss said I seemed like ‚Äúa new man.‚Äù

He was right. Because it wasn‚Äôt me.

The final straw came last night.

I woke up to the sound of humming. Familiar. Low. Coming from the kitchen.

I crept out of bed and peeked around the corner.

There he was.

Sitting at my table.

Wearing my clothes. Eating my cereal. Reading my book.

He looked up and smiled‚Äîmy smile, but warmer. More human.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said, just like in the voicemail. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry it had to happen this way.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt speak.

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt doing anything with your life,‚Äù he continued, standing slowly. ‚ÄúNo ambition. No passion. Wasting every day. I‚Äôm fixing it.‚Äù

He stepped closer.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm better at being you.‚Äù

I slammed the door and ran. I‚Äôve been hiding in a motel for two nights now, writing this from a burner phone.

I don‚Äôt know what he is. A copy? A parasite? Something from another world?

But he‚Äôs taken everything. My job. My friends. My family.

And the worst part?

No one has noticed.

I called my brother an hour ago. I told him everything. He just laughed and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being weird. You just left my place like twenty minutes ago.‚Äù

Twenty minutes ago?

I‚Äôm in another city.

He‚Äôs replacing me, piece by piece. Erasing me.

If you‚Äôre reading this, and something‚Äîanything‚Äîstrange starts happening:

The mirror.

1l5jj6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/apprenticeuk/comments/1l5jj6y/ranking_the_runnerups_kristina_grimes_s3/,Ranking the Runner-Ups - Kristina Grimes S3,"Many people were rooting for Kristina to win over Simon. Considering the fact that Simon placed decently high in my winner rankings, let‚Äôs see how well Kristina does in my runner up rankings to compare!

_____

*Episode 1* - **Good**

Kristina bizarrely isn‚Äôt featured much in the first few episodes. In this one we did hear her say that they had spent too much on their inventory resulting in Sophie putting back some of their chocolate biscuits and the main stand seemed to sell really well and Kristina was a part of that team. The main issues with this team was Sophie‚Äôs ridiculous overspend on the milk (due to assuming they‚Äôd sell 1000 cups of coffee a day) and Gerri‚Äôs uselessness with the mobile van so I don‚Äôt fault Kristina for the loss here.

*Episode 2* - **Bad**

Only thing we saw her do here is lead the ‚ÄòPets in the City‚Äô pitch where she struggled to answer the retailer‚Äôs questions and they didn‚Äôt get any orders from this store so I have to put this one as a bad performance from her here. I get the doggy cupboard wasn‚Äôt exactly a unique product to begin with though.

*Episode 3* - **Mixed**

Obviously the kissogram idea Kristina pushed for was completely ridiculous but to be fair that was only because Naomi wasn‚Äôt coming up with any other viable alternatives and it was so late in the day that they were forced to go with the last idea they had and sadly that was the kissograms. Now Naomi herself said that Kristina was very helpful on the task since she helped her drum up business for their initial face painting pitch, managed the disruptive characters on the team and was coming up with solutions for the problems the team was facing during the day so I won‚Äôt call this a bad performance from Kristina. However the kissogram idea alone warrants this to be knocked down to mixed tier. Side note why was Ghazal so excited to be the girl‚Äôs pimp lmao?

*Episode 4* - **Good**

Her and Tre bought all the props and signage for their market stand in the zoo which ended up looking really good. They also bought the lollipop sticks at a 1000 bag quantity but I won‚Äôt knock them too much because the seller would not budge at all on the price or quantity at all. She also was shown to sell really well on the actual day.

*Episode 5* - **Fantastic**

Her first time as PM and it was an excellent performance. She was able to easily secure the best artist by building great rapport with them (let‚Äôs be honest the horse paintings were literally the only good option this task) and managed her team very well the entire day. Everyone had nothing but praise to say about her leadership in the boardroom.

*Episode 6* - **Good**

Despite dealing with Paul being a tragedy as PM and sidelining his whole team to run off with Katie for the entire time in France, Kristina was able to find somewhere to cook the sausages (since the stupid baked bean can method wasn‚Äôt working) and took charge of the market stand. She also vehemently disagreed with the idea of going with cheese for their main product during the first day which obviously was the right opinion based on this team‚Äôs end result of a loss.

*Episode 7* - **Good**

I will critique both her and Katie for not wanting to go to the airport to pick up the nigella seeds but Sugar praised both of them for their excellent negotiation skills and if Adam had just read the rules and known that it was better to arrive late and grab all the items then this team would have won.

*Episode 8* - **Good**

This is a pretty low tier good ranking I can‚Äôt lie. She did draw the ‚ÄòJam‚Äô logo for the trainer and she did rightfully oppose Ghazal and Katie‚Äôs direction of their campaign but I‚Äôm not sure she offered all that much in terms of alternate ideas. She was the least problematic member of the losing team though which is why I‚Äôll keep this one‚Äôs ranking as it is.

*Episode 9* - **Fantastic**

The whole team of Katie, Kristina and Naomi did fantastically here selling the products they chosen from the Canada representatives and especially double that for Kristina who was working all on her own. 

*Episode 10* - **Awful**

This might be harsh since she was the winning PM but mostly everyone on this task did really poorly and she was no exception. She completely fumbled the vacuum presentation: basically doing a Liam and breaking it live on air and took ages to even set it up in the first place, constantly kept repeating herself during the chocolate fountain presentation, made Lohit present the woman‚Äôs underwear product alongside Katie in which obviously he wouldn‚Äôt be able to give much input on and her team was only able to make 10% of the sales the TV station usually gets during that time period. 

*Episode 12* - **Mixed**

I think her finale performance was the main reason she lost this season to be honest. Her team showed signs of being frustrated with her during the day, her building design had a lot of flaws and she struggled in the Q&A portion of the presentation. I don‚Äôt think this was a truly bad performance to be honest but Simon just did a lot better overall

**Kristina‚Äôs Final Stats**

Fantastic - 2 Episodes 

Good - 5 Episodes 

Mixed - 2 Episodes 

Bad - 1 Episode 

Awful - 1 Episode 

Kristina clearly is a strong candidate and had some great highlights through her time but to be honest I kinda expected her stats to be a little better than what they are. Still she‚Äôs now second in my rankings with Saira a close third.

**Runner-Up Rankings So Far:**

1: Ruth Badger S2

2: Kristina Grimes S3

3: Saira Khan S1

*First, from ‚ÄúMY Fantasy Life‚Äù living in the Fantasy RV Park with My Fantasy Polyamorous Partners and Five Fantasy Kids:*

*Apologies for missing two days of posting. At work we are seeing off some of our Spring Season clients. Although many are experienced RV warriors, some need assistance with disconnecting lines, hooking up trailer to rig, pulling out, and navigating toward the road. And there are final bills to settle. But these are not just clients, they are cherished BFFs. We can‚Äôt see them off without one more coffee and chat to learn about their summer plans. Dee always prepares a snack for them to enjoy on the road. Then come the hugs and tears. But we‚Äôll see almost all of them again after Labor Day.*

*Friday is ice-skating day for Longhouse Elem. Lori and Dei are becoming fast friends. Dei has been coming with the Twinettes and Lori afterschool to the ice-skating rink (and staying for an extra session on Friday). It is just a joy to watch the girls together.*

*June is Future Division Month in the SGI. So we had an uncontentious planning meeting last night by Zoom. We are going to do [The Parable of the Jewel in the Robe](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/material-for-discussion-meetings-7/) and play act the parable. We will have a ‚ÄúMy Favorite Toy‚Äù show-and-tell so even the Twinmen and Benjamin Kdak√© can participate. Guy will give his experience of getting Longhouse Elem off the ground and give examples of how he draws power from NHR-1.*

*We also had a frank talk about attendance. Thirteen RV Park Group members participated in May 3rd Contributions. So why aren‚Äôt 13 members (excluding kids) coming out to the discussion meeting and what can we do about it?*

Let me get started with Daisaku Ikeda‚Äôs lecture. I know Blanche across the hedges believes the primary message of the Lotus Sutra lives with the teachings of Guanyin in the 25th Chapter
. Maybe she‚Äôs right because a [statue of Guanyin](https://www.alaintruong.com/archives/2016/12/05/34652182.html) sold for EUR 5,170,500 a few years back. Of course, Blanche is entitled to her opinion and she is the foremost and most highly acknowledged expert on Buddhism based on her degrees, publications, and the vast compassion of her posts on Reddit.

But Daisaku Ikeda expresses a different viewpoint:

>The widespread propagation of the Mystic Law in the Latter Day‚Äîthis is the great vow expressed in the Lotus Sutra, representing not only the individual wish of Shakyamuni but the shared aspiration of Many Treasures Thus Come One and all Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the ten directions and three existences.

This is very clear. And here we are at the start of SGI-USA‚Äôs three-month Summer of Shakubuku Campaign! I have to chant more about this. I meet many people in town and at the skating-rink, many are now friends. But how do I help my new friends take steps close to Buddhism?

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>In the three pronouncements of the ‚ÄúTreasure Tower‚Äù chapter of the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni calls out in a loud voice to those gathered in the great assembly, urging them to propagate the Lotus Sutra after his passing. He says in effect: ‚ÄúMany Treasures Buddha roars the lion‚Äôs roar because of his great vow. All of you should likewise make a great vow to uphold and spread this sutra‚Äù (see The Lotus Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras, p. 217). 

According to the lore of the Lotus Sutra, we were all present in this space-time anomaly Great Assembly when the Buddha revealed his eternal lifespan, ‚Äúkuon ganjo‚Äù ‚Äì or ‚ÄúTime without beginning or end‚Äù (See *Fundamentals of Buddhism*, p. 79)

Now Buddha White Cheese (BlancheFromage) with there with me at this primordial Great Assembly Kuon Gango Ceremony. Three times the Buddha yelled out his vow for the great propagation. I heard it, why didn‚Äôt BF? I think I remember her playing tag with Guanyin. If only the Buddha had yelled out a fourth time, BF and I wouldn‚Äôt be having this debate across the hedges!

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>This vow the Buddhas and bodhisattvas made in response to Shakyamuni‚Äôs call for the sutra‚Äôs widespread propagation in the Latter Day of the Law began to be fulfilled in a true sense with the appearance of Nichiren Daishonin.

It helps you focus on the good stuff in your life, be more optimistic, and just be mentally healthier. If you wanna start one, here's a few steps that can help:

First, pick a format. It can be a paper journal, on your computer, or even an app on your phone ‚Äì just make sure it's easy for you to use. If you like writing on paper, get a nice notebook that you like looking at, so it inspires you to write.

Then, decide how often you wanna write. Some people like to do it every day, others a few times a week, or just when they feel like it. The important thing is to be consistent, so it becomes a habit. The time of day matters too: a lot of people find mornings or evenings are best, when their mind is calmer and more focused.

When you start writing, don't be afraid to be specific. Don't just write ""I'm grateful for my family,"" say *why*. Like, you could mention how your brother called to see how you were doing, or how your family got together for dinner. Being specific helps you really appreciate the things you're grateful for.

Don't just write about big stuff or achievements. Little things in everyday life, like a good cup of coffee in the morning, a nice walk in the park, or a stranger smiling at you can be great things to be grateful for. It helps you see the beauty in ordinary stuff and be more positive.

Also, you can look back at your old entries sometimes. It'll help you remember good times, but also let you see how much good stuff happens in your life. When you see improvements and positive changes, you'll know your journal is working.

Keeping a gratitude journal is a personal thing, so there's no right or wrong way to do it. Just be honest and open. Your goal isn't just to write, but to really appreciate what you have. It'll make your life better and help you see how you're growing. Wanna share what you wrote today? Who and what are you most grateful for today?",1,1749298587.0,ThoughtfulSpace,0,1.0,False

One was Emily ‚Äî smart, dedicated, loved by the team.
The kind of person who stayed late to help others, who fixed problems quietly, who never made a show of her efforts.

The other was Mark ‚Äî average technically, but well-spoken, always had coffee with management, laughed at the right jokes, nodded at the right times.

Everyone assumed Emily would get it.
She didn‚Äôt.

Mark was promoted.
No announcement, no fanfare ‚Äî just a quiet update in the org chart.

Emily smiled. Said ‚ÄúCongrats.‚Äù And went back to work.
Two weeks later, she handed in her resignation.

‚∏ª

I asked her privately, just to understand.

She said:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not upset about the title.
I‚Äôm just sad to realize I‚Äôve been walking the wrong path for years.
I truly believed that if you work hard, be kind, and deliver results, you‚Äôll be seen.
Now I understand ‚Äî in this place, no one sees.
They just hear‚Ä¶ and remember who talks to them most.‚Äù

Emily isn‚Äôt the only one.
There are so many quiet, competent people slowly burning out ‚Äî not from overwork, but from misalignment.

I‚Äôve been chasing better consistency in my shots lately and was honestly getting frustrated by constant channeling, even with careful puck prep. I was getting close to pulling the trigger on a new grinder, thinking maybe my DF54 just wasn‚Äôt cutting it.

But then I made a small change that made a big difference: I started grinding directly into the portafilter, followed by WDT, instead of using a dosing cup and transferring. Same coffee, same dose, same WDT tool and method ‚Äî the only difference was skipping the cup.

And suddenly‚Ä¶ much more even extractions, significantly less channeling, and more predictable results.

Has anyone else experienced this? I‚Äôm assuming the transfer from the cup may be disturbing the grind distribution somehow.",2,1749298449.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I (27F) met this guy, Caleb (32M), at a mutual friend‚Äôs birthday party. We talked all night, he was charming, funny, seemed super into me. We ended up hooking up that night and spent the entire weekend together. It honestly felt like the beginning of something real.

He told me he was single. No mention of a relationship, let alone a fianc√©e.

About two weeks later, I ran into him at a coffee shop. He looked like he‚Äôd seen a ghost. He was with a woman. She introduced herself as *his fianc√©e*, Leah. I didn‚Äôt say anything at the time, but when I got home I stalked her socials and saw their engagement photos. They‚Äôd been planning a wedding for over a year. I felt physically sick.

I sat with it for a few days, unsure if I should say anything. But then I thought about if the roles were reversed. I‚Äôd want to know. So I messaged her. I kept it respectful, I showed her screenshots, and told her everything. She didn‚Äôt respond at first, but three days later I got a message from her sister thanking me and letting me know the wedding was off.

Now I‚Äôm getting blown up by Caleb and two of his friends calling me a homewrecker. They‚Äôre saying I had no business getting involved, that I should‚Äôve just stayed quiet. But I honestly didn‚Äôt know he was engaged. And I don‚Äôt think protecting a liar is the right thing to do.
