About 10 mins or so later she held her hand out and asked if we could hold hands it was extremely cute and I accepted, we held hands walking round literally most of the date and even when going into shops 

How much of a big deal is this in your opinion what does this mean in your opinion also I think it's quite rare for women to initiate this sort of thing especially on the first date but I was happy she did ",1,1737254594.0,OnlineDating,0,1.0,False
1i4o8gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1i4o8gy/the_pentagon_is_monitoring_these_subs_tonight/,The Pentagon is monitoring these subs tonight (NewsMax episode) to determine the effectiveness of their ongoing psyop,"It's a ""72 and fluorescent"" office. White shirts and clean haircuts, coffee cups here and there upon desks. Eyes scan left to right, left to right, behind glasses with monitor glare reflections.

The websites being scrolled and monitored are Reddit, x.com, 4chan, and several other major discussion boards and social media sites.

Feedback is tracked, noted, and logged. Points are allotted towards threads coming in of ""people giving up"" on UFO disclosure, to people defending the cause. Assets in place, working on behalf of the agencies within the UFO community, are having their work come to full fruition.

Several threads right here in this subreddit are titled with people leaving or unsubbing the UFO topics. Surely eyes in the agencies have already seen each one of these, and dulely taken note.

This is the scene I would easily believe is taking place. For weeks now I have been losing my faith and interest in the ufology community as I've determined the high likelihood of disclosure advocate after disclosure advocate is probably working in some part or some degree as controlled disinfo.

I will not go down the list of names and start throwing accusational mud at the major players, in the event I'm mistaken and that they're actually well meaning, legitimate journalists.

I won't bother with a detailed essay listing all the small hints, vocal tones, body queues, and rehearsed signs and signals which I believe are aplenty to add suspicion the more you pay attention.

But that is where I've moved in my opinions on the matter.

So where do I currently stand on the issue now?

I believe, despite the sarcasm and pessimism of my post so far, disclosure IS happening sooner than later, and that things are really coming to a head. I've shifted to the speculation that the agencies know - for any number of possible reasons, of which good cases and arguments have been made - that disclosure is happening whether they want it to or not, and can't hold it back indefinitely. And so, I think they are actively using controlled misinformation to either A. Burn out and disappoint peoples' interest just like is happening tonight with New Max, in order to buy them more time before disclosure as the public walks away from the topic, or B. Slow drip *but still using lies, disinfo, or misdirection* to prime the public but without actually giving up their secret toys and capability.

I just really don't think anymore the disclosure community is a group of genuine, external and independent journalists working for no one else but the people and the truth, and I'll leave it at that and not throw mud.

And if one of these journalists wants to win our trust?

1. Stop playing games, ""teehee, I have answers, but I can't tell you.""
2. Stop putting into behind pay walls
3. Stop promising ""things will happen soon""
4. Stop prefixing every single statement you make with ""I've heard.."" and ""I've been told"". WHETHER YOU HAVE OR NOT, this is the language of conartists, so you'd think you'd pick a better strategy for engaging with your audience other than aligning 99% with conartists/fraud/grifter behavioral patterns",1,1737254521.0,conspiracy,1,1.0,False

Any tips or advice on how to heal from this are welcome and appreciated. Thanks ❤️ (also I’m very bad at punctuation but I tried my best, sorry!) (also also, English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes) 

2,5 months ago I 26F met a girl via a shared friend at a party. We hit it off immediately. We have a lot of shared interests and we live pretty close, about a 30 minute drive. We start talking and eventually exchange numbers. For two weeks, we talk every day start to end. We have the same humour and I caught myself audibly laughing at messages multiple times. 

Eventually we meet up for coffee and it’s great, no awkward silences but just talking and laughing. I was super excited and pretty giddy to see her again so I invited her over for a movie night a couple days later. We ended up doing this at her place. It was a lot of fun! Her boyfriend was really nice and it felt so easy, like me and her knew each other for years. 

A week passes and we have a movie night at my place. Again no weird silences or anything out of the ordinary. She even got me a couple of gifts and told me she was happy she met me. 

But all of a sudden, after that last movie night she’s just gone completely ice cold on me. I mean a complete 180 degree turn. For the past three weeks, she doesn’t text me anymore, I start every conversation and even then, it takes her either five days to reply, or she doesn’t respond at all. When I express my concerns about this - like if I have done something wrong and if she’s okay - she just says nothing is wrong. I’ve tried asking her if she needed space, which was met with a “no”. Her birthday was three days ago, I sent her a card and a present but she hasn’t said anything. 

I’m honestly devastated. I’m mad at my brain for not being able to let this go. I’ve known her for such a short time, but those few weeks it really felt like I had a buddy. My other two friends live quite far and it was so cool to have someone close by. She was also just a really cool person. 

The thought that I’m struggling with this every day while she has probably forgotten about me makes me so sad. I know messaging her further doesn’t work because she doesn’t reply, and I know she’s fine because she’s active on instagram. 

Reading this back it may sound like I’m in love with her but I have a boyfriend and I’m in a happy relationship. I just tend to get attached to people and I hadn’t experienced such a carefree and fun friendship in a loooooong time. It really felt like something for life for a while.

I was missing a 1911 in my life.

I decided to ament this self proclaimed sin of mine by trying to find the ""perfect"" 1911.

I wanted one that was both of known heirloom quality but rare enough to be a collector item.
I wanted a pistol that was both interesting to look at, but also a shooter and, finally, I wanted aesthetics that while clearly modern and modernistic in nature, didn't venture in the ""space gun from the new Villeneuve movie"" realm that almost all 2011 and many 1911 fall into. 

Meet a gun that had been sitting at my LGS for months, and that has been discontinued since circa 2017.

The Springfield TGO-1. A collaboration with Rob Leatham, known The Great One, and probably the last great creation of Springfield Custom Shop, before its doors were shut down also around 2017.

I have put 300 rounds through it without a single issue and accuracy, shootability, trigger, fit and finish are just about what you'd expect.

I am thoroughly happy, unfortunately 1911s seem to have the habit of multiplying when you're not paying attention... And I already got my second 1911, with a completely different approach, a tisas that is becoming my project gun... More to follow, maybe.

1i4o728,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1i4o728/hey_you/,Hey you,"Hello my darling,

I haven’t heard that in a while but this is what popped up in my mind to address you today. I miss you. I miss us, if there was an us at all and not a figment of my imagination. A mirage on a hazy sultry summer night.

I found one of our older messages today. Where you promised never to leave me hanging and that you are not going anywhere. The chat I could send in my most vulnerable thoughts and my most intrusive brain farts to, my hand trembles if I open it and can’t type a single “Hi” to. I know you’re on the other end, living and breathing despite telling me if I don’t hear from you I can safely assume you got hit by a car. 

You said you were settling for less and putting up with bad behaviour in your life before me, the irony of it is I did the same when I was with you. Over pouring to make up for the empty spaces you left. You said you treat people like how they treat you, I wonder when I made you feel like you were asking for too much by standing up for yourself.

You came after me. Chased me. Built trust. Kept coming back after I pushed you away. Held me close. Stayed with me when I was having really bad nights. Made me laugh. Checked in on me. Denied anything was wrong when I repeatedly asked you. Denied me clarity and closure when I asked if I can just say good bye now. Decided to walk out of my life on a Tuesday.

You had a way around you to make strangers feel good. Your kindness extended to people around you known and unknown and the stark lack of it made me cry into my pillow for days. The trust you built and broke had me questioning the authenticity of our every reaction. 

It has been weeks and I held a private funeral, grieved and let go. I walked past your place with a friend today as we were getting lunch and I couldn’t help but think you were just there on the other side of brick and glass. A part of me wants to throw pebbles at a grown man’s window and the other part wants to rage. 

In the end you were not the man you said you were. I stayed true to my word till then end. I deeply cared about you, but it was time I showed up for myself than keep showing up for you. Where do I put down all our memories? Where do I dispose off the knowledge that you liked your coffee black and your burgers loaded with extra onions? 

If some day you do become emotionally available to another person, I hope you can actually make room to receive their love and not play with it and go back to your old patterns. 

C, If we cross paths again, say hi. Reach out, text me. I hate myself for it but I will reply. I never reached out because I didn’t want to see Read: 9:35 pm. Please linger. 

Please. 

Love,
A. ",1,1737254388.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1i4o71b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtsyWeirdoPerfume/comments/1i4o71b/luckyscent_haul_first_impressions/,LuckyScent Haul First Impressions,"\- Sora Dora Jany: Spiced apple candle. Definitely a red apple. Feels very autumnal. Spilled a little on my skin and it opens up to include an interesting steamed white rice note. My partner says it smells like a sweet drink.

\- Hilde Soliani Sempre Natale: Cloves! Mulling spices! Reminds me of gluwein without the wine. Has a lovely sillage just on the dabber wand, makes me think it may open up absolutely beautifully on skin.

\- Theodoris Kalotini Cinnamon Rolls: I think this one suffered from being sniffed *right* after two *very* spice-heavy scents. All we got was the butter. It leans a little movie-theater, artificial, margarine. My partner made quite a scrunch face.  

\- By Killian Black Phantom: Smells nothing like coffee, in a masculine way. My partner says it smells like ""dirt, but not in a bad way."" I want to re-sniff this one with a fresh nose.

\- By Killian Rolling in Love: Very pleasant. Soft. Sort've floral. Well-blended in the way where it's hard to pick out any individual notes. Recalls lotions from my youth. I sound underwhelmed but it's actually very pretty and would be a perfect bedtime scent. Dare I call it cozy? 

\- Strangers Sweet Farewell: Also very soft and inoffensive, but with a strange peppery note jarring an otherwise cozy composition. You get soft, perfumed, very milky rice... and black pepper. Not sure where that's coming from. I'm very pepper-sensitive so this one might end up a scrubber. 

\- Strangers Chokedee: Smells like a green, generic mall perfume, then morphs into a green banana. A modern banana, at that, not a banana candy. Confusing but in a way that makes me want to try it on skin to see what it becomes.

\- J-scent Rakugan: I smelled this one before all the others and got fruity notes--green apple, almost. Smelling it again with a more fatigued nose, I mostly get a faint round sweetness. My partner likes it, though he can't really identify any of the notes. Another that deserves a sniff all by itself.

\- Parfumerie Generale Musc Maori: Chocolate! Though leaning more Tootsie-roll than dark artisanal bar. It's lighter than my usual Jousset Le Gourmand. More powder, probably because of the musk. I don't know that I need another chocolate--Le Gourmand does what I want--but it's interesting to see another facet of the note.

\- Kyse Zuccero Filato: Opens with a rotting strawberry note that made me say, ""Ew!"" out loud. My partner got it, too. Thankfully that dies away within seconds, and you're left with strawberry spun sugar. The strawberry leans more naturalistic--and more sour--than your average strawberry cotton candy, constantly flirting with the edge of overripe. Apart from that bombastic opening, the scent is actually quite tame sillage-wise. 

\- Cirque de Soleil: Strawberry jam on a funnel cake with popcorn somewhere in the vicinity. Flowers happen briefly but the main star is strawberry-butter-pastry. I find it a very cozy scent. Partner thinks it 'meh.' We're at the very end of our sniffing journey so I think his nose is just fatigued. Another that deserves its own sniff tomorrow!

A brief note on LuckyScent itself: Whoever is in charge of filling up the vials is doing a good job! They're so full I'm almost nervous to open them. Definitely getting your money's worth.

Day 1
 BLUESTONE LANE CAFE TRIBECA, we got a bacon egg and cheese croissant, blueberry pancakes, iced Chai latte and a shot of espresso and a side of eggs, the Chai was good the espresso was fine but I don't really drink espresso that's what my bf got. the croissant was just okay, but the pancakes were the most mid pancakes I've ever had, like how do you mess up a pancake?? they had absolutely no flavor apart from the blueberry preserve on them. 
the pros was the service was very nice and the restaurant vibe is very nice.
(best pancakes I've ever had was pancake pantry in Gatlinburg TN) 

ANGELINA BAKERY
after walking times square we went to Angelina bakery and got a Nutella latte, a hot chocolate, a Nutella donut, almond croissant and a  mini fruit tart.
the donut was my favorite and the croissant was good the fruit tart was good and the hot chocolate, the Nutella latte wasn't very good
I'd give this place a 6/10 again the food here wasn't exactly bad but it was mid like I've had much better pastries from other bakeries 

LITTLE ITALY PIZZA
don't know which one but it was right next to our hotel which was the downtown millennium by the world trade center
we got cheese pizza, it was extremely mid like I 100% would rather have domino's pizza or something, and we had a spinach mozzarella roll which was definitely one of the worst things I had on the trip, I love spinach and cheese but the spinach was wet tasting and apart from the overbearing spinach it didn't have much other flavor.

Day 2

787 COFFEE CO. 
I saw this coffee place suggested on tiktok a lot and specifically the cinnamon toast iced latte, so my bf got a hot one and I got the iced which added up to I think $23, it was the worst coffee we had the whole trip, yk when you leave iced coffee out and the ice melts? that's what this coffee tasted like fresh. they also took our picture to ""post on their Instagram"" which they never did.

WOKWOK
 we walked around Chinatown and for lunch ate at wokwok and got a Thai iced tea, spring egg rolls, and grilled chicken and beef satay,
the Thai tea was really good and the satay was okay had a nice flavor. the spring rolls weren't good at all like I'd much rather eat the ones from panda express. the service wasnt great either, they never checked on us even tho it wasn't busy at all and when my bf was in the middle of ordering the waitress answered a personal phone call and i could hear the conversation it wasn't anything important just someone asking what she was doing.

TEA & SYMPATHY 
we then went to tea & sympathy and got afternoon tea for 1, says on the online menu $40 but it was like $60, which came with egg salad sandwiche, chicken, and tuna salad sandwiches for the savory tier, the top tier was a scone with cream and some sort of jelly,  sponge cake, a cupcake, my boyfriend also had to order a sandwich since the waiter told us you cant just get tea you have to order a meal with it so he got a chicken salad sandwich and for tea I ordered English breakfast and he got some sort of cinnamon tea
the tea was okay like I've had better but it's just tea, and then all the sandwiches were extremely mid, the bread was stale and I've had much much better egg, chicken and tuna salad. me and my bf did not like the spongecake at all, the cupcake was really good and I don't even like cupcakes, the scone was also good but that's something I rarely ever have. the service was very slow but it was busy and I tried to ask for fake sugar for our tea and they told us they didn't have any only real sugar.. but I loved the vibe of the restaurant and it is on the cheaper end for afternoon tea.

SANT AMBROEUS BROOKFIELD
for dinner we ate at sant ambroeus Brookfield, we got the ravioli, the burger, tarimasu and machiato. The ravioli was really good and the burger is very good if you like veal, it was the first time I had veal and I found out I'm not a big fan of it but my bf loved it, and the burger was very juicy.
I didnt really like the tarimasu but again I just don't like tarimasu, my bf loved it. the machiato wasn't very good and was in the world's tiniest Teacup, but the restaurant was very pretty and had a relaxing vibe.

Day 3
BAGEL MARKET 
we got our first nyc bagels from this bagel market on William St. it was pretty mid, the Einstein bagels we ate in the airport was way better but I really liked the coffee because it wasn't extremely expensive and didn't taste like shit.

FOOD TRUCK
for lunch we had a food truck hot dog with fries, and my bf got chicken curry. the hot dog was okay, the fries weren't good but the curry was really good.

COFFEE FOOD TRUCK
This food truck was next to central park and the coffee was not cheap and it was pretty horrible, also had tanghulu in Koreatown and that was one of my favorite things I ate.

12 CHAIRS CAFE
for dinner we ate at 12 chairs Cafe in soho
we got the hummus, labneh and pierogi 
the hummus was okay but I'm not a big fan of hummus but my bf is and he ate all of it so I'm guessing he liked it. I'd never had labneh before so I can't really rate it but I wasn't a fan of it. and the pierogi just tasted like mid mashed potatoes inside a dumpling which is okay but nothing amazing. some of the other dishes looked way better so I think we just didn't know what to order here, the restaurant was extremely busy and so loud, they blast electronic music and everyone's talking so loud to talk over the music.

FOOD TRUCK 2
Later that night we got some chicken marsala and cheese Naan, next to the fine dining place it was the best food we'd had. I also got a matcha boba drink, which was nice but I can get one here half the price that's just as nice.

Overall the food was just so mid it shocked us, every city and town I've visited I've never experienced so many restaurants that did Not hit the spot and feels like you're being robbed when you see the price.


also want to shout out the rude workers at starscape, before we left my shoe came untied and I cant just bend over bc im bundles in a million layers since it's freezing and windy outside so I need somewhere to sit, there were 2 chairs in the car area but they were taken by the only 2 other people in the building so I sat on the stairs, the worker then told my bf I can't sit there in a rude tone, so my bf said ""she just needs to tie her shoe real quick"" and the worker smarted off at him and said ""this is a service we can't just have people sitting around tying their shoe, she can go outside"" I'd 100% understand if it was busy in there and people were using the stairs but THERE WAS LITERALLY NO ONE IN THERE AND IT TAKES 2 SECONDS TO TIE A SHOE like by the end of them talking my shoe was tied because obviously I just ignored her and tied my show anyways and they acted like I had asked to take a nap on the stairs.",0,1737253771.0,AskNYC,13,0.25,False
1i4nzna,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4nzna,"25[F4M] - Manchester / UK / Europe / Canada / USA – seeking a loving, caring, fulfilling relationship.","Hello, hope you’re having a lovely weekend! I’ve had limited luck with dating apps and meeting in person has also been tricky, so giving this platform a go. 

I’m 25, straight, woman, childfree, and only align with monogamy. I’m looking for someone who’s emotionally available and is fully ready and open to the possibility of a long-term, committed partnership. If things work out, I also hope to settle down with the person and envision marriage down the line. I want to take things slowly – get to know each other first, see if we’re compatible on key things (habits, values, future, etc.), and then go from there. This is going to be a lengthy post, but I want to be open about myself and what I’m looking for on here – thanks for taking the time to read this! 

About me: 
* I’m based in Manchester, UK and fully enjoy living here and absolutely love this city. I’d ideally like to date within Manchester/Northern England/UK, but am also open to long-distance (i.e., USA, Canada, or Europe) as long as there’s regular communication, loyalty, and desire to end the gap down the line. I’m open to relocating to these countries and think it’s definitely worth it if it’s with the right person. 
* I speak English, Tamil, Hindi, and a little bit of Malayalam. I absolutely love languages and want to learn as many I can! 
* I LOVE fancy coffee shops and pastries and enjoy people-watching. My favourite one at the moment are Gail’s and Federal (I love their Turkish eggs!). I also like trying different cuisines – I’d really like to try Injera and Jollof rice sometime! I’m inconsistent with cooking but I find it so rewarding and satisfying – I’d consider myself a decent cook and like most of the stuff that I make. I really need to get back on track and start meal-planning! I’m really passionate about mental health and have lived experience of it. In my free time,  I volunteer for the Samaritans as a Listening Volunteer, and it’s been a rewarding, insightful experience being able to listen to callers in distress. I’m also absolutely passionate about social issues and world history and trying to educate myself as best I can. Music and nature have also helped me immensely with my mental health. I’ve quite a varied music taste – I love anything that’s vibrant, engaging, and upbeat (pop, reggae, indie/electronic, etc.) – my current favourite artist is Jungle! Other than these, I HAVE to have a doom-scrolling sesh on TikTok at least an hour everyday – need to keep with current discourse and dances! 
* I’m 5”2, 75 kgs, and south Indian (Tamil and Malayali – quite complicated to explain here….) with black-ish hair and brown eyes. I work in retail and am generally quite physically active and on my feet all the time. I’m very grateful for my features. 
* I’m deeply sensitive and empathic, chatty, bubbly, self-aware, and reflective. I’m ambiverted – I enjoy being in social settings but also need quiet time to slow down and recharge.
* I’m left, align with intersectional feminism, and value social justice and inclusivity and actively try and embed this into my life. 
* Fun/interesting facts about me:
- I speak one of the oldest living languages of the world;
- I’ve never smoked/drank/tried drugs in my life – something I’m very proud of and it was a promise I’d made for myself as a teenager;
- I love national anthems and know the national anthems of 12-ish countries – my favourite one is of course Indian, but really love American and New Zealand!; 

What I’m looking for:
• I only align with monogamy and looking for someone between 27-34. I’m fine with someone slightly older than this (upto 36 max), but certainly not younger.
• I’m drawn towards taller men with beards and those with a great smile. But ultimately, what’s more important is that they take care of their appearance and health. 
• I’m left, align with intersectional feminism, pro-choice, and strongly want to advocate for social justice and inclusivity. It’s important for me to date someone with similar beliefs and values. 
• I’m Hindu, but am not very religious and fall on the agnostic/atheist spectrum. However, I rarely like to pray and go to temples (more for relaxation than anything) and like to celebrate festivals/traditions (more due to cultural reasons). 

Dealbreakers: 
- Smoking and drugs – can’t compromise on these! I’m ok if my partner drinks as long as it’s not excessive (more like I’m ok with “social drinking”);
- Addicted to porn; 
- Cheating/lying; 
- Not wanting marriage;
- Polygamy/open-relationship;
- Lack of/limited cultural interest/engagement;
- Not a cat person. I prefer cats over dogs and want someone who’s on the same page with this;
- Racist, sexist/misogynist, homophobic, classist; 
- Politically misaligned - right-wing;
- Poor financial management/planning/has a big debt;
- Fencesitters.

Ultimately, I’m looking to build a loving and loyal relationship rooted in mutual respect, trust, and a sense of comfort. I want to be able to create a safe haven for my partner and vice versa, where we can be ourselves, nurture each other, and let our inner child feel truly happy and at peace. If you think we’d be a good match, DM me. I’d love to hear from you! 😊 x",4,1737253699.0,cf4cf,0,0.83,False
1i4nz1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1i4nz1l/i_do_night_watch_at_a_wildlife_sanctuary_in_the/,I do night watch at a wildlife sanctuary in the Florida Everglades,"I've lived in SWFL my whole life. Halfway between wild and urban. Opulent and shabby. Mansions and crack dens. Beachfront and deep swamp. You don't realize how rich some people are until you drive through some of these subdivisions in Naples. All that money, and unless you're a talented bartender, it doesn't quite trickle down, especially in September. In Florida, our only two seasons are hurricane and tourist. So, a few months ago, when the market decided to take a shit, I decided it was time to find a second job. 

""Isaiah Combs 8-10 Live"" An A-frame blackboard sign read outside the only barren bar on the bustled street. I lugged in my PA, eyes darting from the marble bar top, bleach-white walls, and in stark contrast to the more fashionable nature of the rest of the bar; metal signs, with messages printed reading ""If you ain't fallen over yet you need another beer!"" and ""If beer isn't the answer you're asking the wrong question!"" that would be more at home in your boomer uncle's man cave that he fully furnished with Temu and Hobby Lobby. 4 or 5 years ago someone cared about this place. Had an elegant vision of a locale with all the class of a 5-star hotel lobby bar. That was until a new owner or manager, what have you, said to themself ""This is not what bar look like! Bar have pool table and dart board!""

My eyes met the bartender's and I saw the look in his eye before I saw him. He didn't want to be here as much as I did. He couldn't be much older than me, late-20s black button-down with a black tie. I wasn't sure if my polo was out of place yet.

""Can I help you with something, man?"" He had an accent to his voice I couldn't place outside of being European. 

""Yeah, I'm Isaiah, I'm playing here tonight. Liza didn't tell me where she wanted me to set up over the phone."" 

The bartender gestured to the vacant floor space in front of the touchtune, next to an ornate vintage wine cabinet. I bent my knees and carried my speakers to their destination. I could see a line on the floor where the linoleum was faded. Separated only by the black gunk from where a runner rug used to be duct tapped down and no one thought it would be a good idea to spray some goo gone before the tracks of months to years worth of patrons made it a permanent fixture of this hodgepodge. 

I'm starting to not quite care for this place. The bar or the city you take your pick. I finished setting up in record time as there were no drunks giving me the ""I'm gonna shout free bird as loud as I fucking can in about 10 to 15 minutes"" stare. No drunks or anyone for that matter. Just me and Bartender, he told me his name but for the life of me, I couldn't piece together the noise he made in a way that made sense phonetically. 

I jammed there by myself for an hour, an old man shuffled in looking for the bathroom. My tip jar remained as dry as a flood-controlled swamp. The calloused skin on my fingers flaked off with each successful chord change. The clock drudged forward getting closer to 10 pm. By this time a regular was seated at the far end of the bar away from me. I rigged up my harp rack with a G Harmonica to play Seminole Wind. 


When I was a little kid my dad used to take me on expeditions out in the Everglades. He had this story he told me about the skunk ape, basically South Florida's version of Bigfoot. I ate that shit up. We would pack a sack with bologna and cheese sandwiches, deep woods Off with 40% DEET, flashlights, binoculars, fishing gear, and the whole nine yards to go spend the day cavorting out in the swamp searching for signs of the elusive creature. The 2001 Saturn Vue hit Alligator Alley like Magellan on the high sea. Uncharted paved territory as waves of yellow, orange, and pink strobed between the trees in the early hours of daylight. The summer heat cascaded over our skin as we sat, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, under a Cyprus tree enjoying our lunch that day. We never had any luck, I'm still hopeful there's stuff like that out there though. I've always had a fascination with the strange but I'm rational. I know there's likely no Bigfoot, skinwalkers, or most cryptids. And if there are any out there then it's just a part of nature we haven't found yet. Nothing really supernatural about it. 

That doesn't stop me from being cautious when going out on trails though.


My phone rang. It was Harvey. He was the one who got me this shit gig, hey at least I would walk home with two hundred and fifty bucks. Harvey had recently been promoted to good friend after spending quite some time in the acquaintance-zone. Everyone has quirks and flaws but sometimes, Harvey was a bit to stomach.

""Yooo big dog!"" Harvey called out from my phone, ""How's the Hideout? Makin' stacks?""

""Not particularly, there's one dude here and he hasn't taken an eye off his beer since he sat down like 10 minutes ago."" I leaned against the wall separating the out-of-order men's room and ladies' room as my iPad ran the show.

""Mannn, that sucksss dude. If I'm gonna be honest I do not like Liza. Bitch vibes.""

""Yeah, I don't know dude,"" I remembered the old guy from earlier and wondered if he used the women's restroom.

""Oh bro bro, before I forget. You're still looking for something steady right?""

Harvey was about to save my ass again. ""Dude, I'm always looking, what do ya got?""

""Okay, so my uncle's friend or something right, he was chilling and told me he needed some extra help at some wildlife sanctuary or nature trail type shit.""

""What type of work?""

""Bro bro bro, it's nothing. It's a big animal research center in the middle of fucking nowhere and they just need a guy.""

""A guy to do what?""

""Men shit. Watch the place, pick up heavy things when they got em. Like security and stuff mostly.""

""This place is just in the middle of woods somewhere?""

""Yeah bro, security on that place is easy money dog. Deep out in Fakahatchee or Picayune I think. There's no one for miles, you just gonna be on the radio like 'uuhh there's a bear, and nothing else' and that's a band.""

The man on the other end of the bar began a coughing fit. The bartender didn't so much as look up from his phone. I squinted through the dimly lit bipolarly decorated room to see he was wearing AirPods.

""Harvey, text me your uncle's cousin's roommate's number please.""

""Type shit. Let me know if Liza gives you shit tonight, she stiffed me last week.""


Monday afternoon I drove out to the Gore Research Center. This place was in the boonies. There's a funny thing about Florida. It's similar to how the rest of the country is, just shrunk down and set the dial from low to high. Most of the people are on the coast and that's where all the money is. But you drive like 25 minutes and might as well be in Louisiana. I live about 10 minutes from one of the Bidens and another 20 minutes from there my dad found an upturned skiff housing a bale of marijuana. I didn't know they came in bales. Word of the wise, never try to stab one of those thinking you might just take a little bit. Those things are super compact. They had prison crews cleaning up for a couple of days.

I had been driving to meet the woman in charge of the facility for about 30 minutes now. Sedan was not the vehicle for the job. It hadn't rained in about four days which was uncommon that time of year, that was in my favor. I turned right off Golden Gate Parkway to head deep into the Picayune Strand State Forest. Traffic slowly waned as the roads fell into disrepair. Homes that scattered the county road became less and less common. Less and less kept. American flags turn to Trump flags. Trump flags turn to rebel flags. Rebel flags turn to trees. 

After a few miles passed, I came upon a road sign. 

""End County Maintenance.""  

Thud. The car lurched from the asphalt to the cruel limestone sand and dirt, throwing a cloud behind me as I vibrated down the landscape.

A majority of the journey had become unpaved. I had never been out that way. There's an almost unending maze of lefts and rights out there. RV's parked out in the middle of clearings, doing God knows what, strange wooden encampment suspended between the trees. I passed a dead deer around 130th Ave. 


I pulled up to the gate about two hours before sunset. My battle-weary Hyundai splattered with mud, dirt, and grime idled waiting for the gate to open.

I checked my messages with the contact I was given. Not delivered. I had one bar of LTE this far out which honestly surprised me. I sent a new message informing her I was outside. In wait, I took stock of my surroundings. 3 Signs on a post reading:

""No Trespassers KEEP OUT""

""Naithloriendum Wildlife Sanctuary""

And the third, ""Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? Ecclesiastes 7:17""


It was only a few moments before the front gate roared into life. 
The house was something out of Swiss Family Robinson. Towering on all sides were live oaks, Cyprus, and ficus trees. The unkempt driveway led to a winding staircase encroached on by a strangler fig. Jasmine vines climbed the banister on the front porch up to the second floor, its wilted white flowers speckled on the duff. Spanish moss covered the trees and shrouded the home drawing the eye to an observation deck on what looked to be the third floor. It was as if nature was reclaiming what was once hers.

She must've been in her early 60's. The gray roots just creeping up from her tightly packed jet-black hair. ""Isaiah, so good to see you!"" She called out from the front door. Her voice was much louder than you'd expect for the distance between us. I had to match the energy, ""Deb! Nice to finally meet in person!""

Feeling some sort of need to take control of this altogether new setting I found myself in, I quickly closed the distance between her and I. Scaling the derelict staircase with a hand outstretched. My enthusiasm, to me, felt outside the bounds of societal convention. The gentle breeze against my palm, as I swung it ahead, made it all too clear that clammy beads of sweat had formed. 

""Come in son, I'll let you get your bearings."" Deb showed me inside an immaculately clean house. House is the wrong word. It was unlived in. No utilitarian furnishings like TVs or kitchen appliances outside of a coffee maker seated on the welcome desk. Above the desk, there was a portrait of a smiling white-haired, bearded old man, with a golden retriever, seated on the front step of the old staircase. Before the strangler fig made its debut.

Deb tossed her jean jacket onto a coat rack by the front door and turned towards me clasping her hands together and teetering from heel to toe. ""Well! Welcome to the education center. This is, of course, Dr.Bob's former home. We do tours, and craft days, and uh the occasional field trip. Well. Unoccasional. It's a bit- just a bit far and obscure and too much of a negative connotation for the schools you know. Anyway! That doesn't stop any of the great work we do!"" Deb's eyes lit up at this. 

""So this is a uh conservation collier restoration site. Basically we are working to uh return this area to its natural habitat. This is a Cyprus hardwood, damn no it's a uh, hardwood, Cyprus, swamp, forest. Hardwood Cyprus swamp forest. While being both in the Picayune Strand we are also smack dab in the middle of uh Big Cyprus's Critical Area of State Concern."" Deb made her way to the rear of the house, passing photographs and newspapers strewn along the wall captioned like it would be at a museum.

""We work to create awareness and of course have boots on the ground here"" She spun to look at me. ""During the day."" She spun back. ""We document tree growth, panther population, water quality, you name it. The further people are from these uh vital environments the more they tend to do well. Flourish.""

We crossed a corridor, sealed by a red velvet rope and two greening, once golden stations. I peered inside seeing one of those wheeled stepladders you see in old libraries. I adjusted my gaze back toward her, ""Keep Florida wild!"" I chimed in.

""Exactly! Yes, that's so good. I like that.""

I felt bad that I was just repeating some Instagram caption I had seen. We both stood there for a moment. I just smiled and nodded through the silence.

""OH,"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together once more. ""W-9 and stuff I'll drop by when I um come to meet you in the morning. Let me show you a little bit around here now."" An about-face towards the front door.

""This was Robert's entertaining area. It was used only by him though. Little to no visitors, those who knew him described him as a bit of a curmudgeon."" She led me to the front reception, and again I saw posted above the door the word ""Naithlorendum""

I grabbed my phone from my pocket to google it. Just as we're rounding the desk to  climb up a second-story staircase Deb interrupts.""Most of what you will need you can find in or under here. Including a charger."" She grabbed the lightning cable and handed it to me. ""Thanks""

""Ab-so-lutly! Now follow me up here and I'll show you some of the exhibits."" As Deb grabbed the guard rail to the staircase she knocked on it three times. We ascended and the age of this building began to show, the air got more still and I could smell the faint nostalgic aroma of mildew. The musty air swirled in vapors as Deb reached for a brittle yellowed light switch at the top of the stairs. ""Click"" 

Nothing.

""This damn-"" She flicked it on and off three times and the overhead fluorescents buzzed, spattered, and awoke with all the vigor of a model T. A taxidermied bear, a few wild boar, a buck and a doe, a bald eagle, gopher tortoises, and a few otters in a menagerie of nature frozen in death. The wall to the left had a nearly 6-foot-long tarpon. 

Deb pointed to the bald eagle ""Don't worry, that's incredibly old."" She must've misinterpreted the bewildered look on my face for concern. Deb went on to explain some of the origins of the animals, or fun facts, or something while I took steps to mentally document my surroundings. Further on into the upstairs, there was a door. Plain wooden door with a black painted profile of a wild hog. I made my approach.

""That's the Pig Room.""

Instinctively I almost blurted out ""The fuck?"" But I caught myself when I turned and faced this short kind-eyed woman who just so happened to be my new boss.

""Pardon""

""The Pig Room""

""Is that-""

""Exactly what you think it is? Yes""

Well, fucking thank you, Deb. I have not a clue in the world what the hell that means. She misread my expression again. She charged forward and opened the door. 

Frankly, there isn't anything I would have called it outside of the Pig Room. Speckled shadows crept through the doorway. A curtained window obscured by the mess of jasmine outside was the only light source. Deb trodded to the center of the room and pulled a cord. Illuminated now was a man's life's work. Glass cases and dioramas. Jars and diagrams. Sketches, notes, photographs, and all dedicated to the pigs. 

There was an old padauk wood bookcase brimmed with a dozen or more jars of fetal pigs suspended in formaldehyde. On another shelf, there were books like ""The Merck Veterinary Manual Eleventh Edition"" bound in navy canvas with silver foil lettering. Another read “The Embryology of  The Pig Second Edition,” with a maroon cover and gold foil emboss. The other shelves were dotted with body parts, trinkets and journals; including a crate filled with 30 to 40 boar tusks. Tacked to the wall was a photocopy of a textbook that read ""Chapter 7 The Structure of Embryos from Nine to Twelve Millimeters in Length,"" on the second page was a diagram of a curled and squashed mass. Little slits for eyes, its shape that of a manatee more than a pig. The center of the room was a stainless steel table. It slanted off slightly towards the opposite wall into a drain. A small trough lined the table, inside were medical instruments like scalpels a bone saw, and other things I didn't recognize. On the other end of the room was a meticulously constructed display, a paper-thin slice of a pig under glass. There were 6 in all,  the same size but different areas of the body. White cartilage encased in meat around the thing's snout, and a cavity with a perfectly round white mass. Organs and bones were perfectly preserved in place and time like some 4th-dimensional creature had trapped the hog there then and now.

I ran my hand along the trough of the operation table, its cool surface had seen years of scratches and wearing. 

I turned my head and caught a glimpse of the cages. Eight separate cages empty of tenants, but exuded an energy of melancholy. Old dusty stained hay and straw lie on the ground of each cell which were only about 2 and a half feet in width and 5 feet deep. The room had no distinct scent.

""Bob took his research very seriously,"" Yeah no shit Deb, I don't think they sell pig slices on Amazon. ""The advancements made in veterinary medicine by Bob are astounding really.""

I took stock of the shelves, textbooks, and general macabre set. ""Well, I can say this is not exactly what I was expecting.""

Deb huffed and shrugged. Knocking on the door three times as she exited and turned towards the next floor up. 


Once completing our tour I followed my boss out to the driveway. 

""I'll be back in the morning around 8 to get the report of the night. There's usually as you'd likely expect not too much activity. If you get bored I have filing in Bob's downstairs study that has to be done. There's a cru de ta platter in the uh break room fridge I think.""

""Thank you, Deb, I really appreciate this opportunity.""

""Ab-so-lutly Isaiah. Don't let the isolation get to you now.""

With that she twirled her keys, clicking the unlock thrice. She clambered up into her dark green Jeep Wrangler and kicked a dust cloud behind her as she left. I strolled out after her seeing her car grow smaller until turning off Desoto back towards civilization. The machines roar waning and waning until… silence.

I took a right turn down 40th Avenue and spotted a sign not too far off. ""Dr.Robert H. Gore III Preserve""

""Hell yeah,"" I instinctively muttered. My sneakers made the satisfying gravel on-sole crunch as I lightly jogged to the trailhead. Twilight had just begun to set in when I rounded the 2-mile loop sign. The forest greets me with an ospreys coo overhead, no other sounds but the gentle breeze swaying between leaves needles, and palmetto branches. The occasional snap and crack; sounds of the wilderness my brain was once so accustomed to. I started a hike on my Apple Watch. My legs needed a stretch after that tumultuous ride, and my mind needed a stretch after the interview, if you could call it that, with Deb. What did she mean by ""don't let the isolation get to you?"" 

I realized after an indeterminate amount of time walking I hadn't been paying close attention to my surroundings. A mossy oak entwined with a sable palm to my right engrossed by vegetation. To my left numerous old Florida pines. Some were full of life, others rotting and brimming with woodpecker burrows. To my front, a narrowing path of toppled palms. To my back, rapidly dwindling daylight.

I had to pick up my pace. 

The more obscured view had made the more treacherous terrain more treacherous. The once smoothly mowed path was now dotted with rocks, branches, and root systems climbing into the overworld. The taller grass made little foot-sized holes vague and unclear. As I made my attempt to bound as quickly and safely as I could through the forest, every squeak, every bird call, every flutter of wings got louder. A branch caught my arm, breaking skin and spilling first blood.  As the evening's light drew closer to the Earth it made the bird's shadows above appear like Thunderbirds in a cat 5. Branches made to be the arms and claws of Mother Nature herself, snatching me back to dust. I reached into my pocket for my phone. I had left it on the front desk. 

I didn't have a flashlight.

I stopped dead in my tracks. The pit that had formed in the back of my throat from breathing in the cold Florida air dropped down into my chest. Decision-making hindered. I picked up the pace. 

I've hiked at night before, technically speaking, but that trail is 714 feet long. You can map it with your eyes closed. In all new territory, while technically on the clock, I've gotten myself much deeper than I had hoped. I'm not lost. The trail is just a loop; there's only one way in and the same way out. Or so I thought. I rounded the corner and there was a dead end. Surrounded by nothing but a thicket of vegetation and densely packed palmettos. I still wasn't lost. I could just turn around and go the same way I came. The orange-colored sky had fully desaturated and turned to an inky black. I bounded down the trail through the night with wanton disregard for the stones and roots that lay in my path. I had to get out of here as soon as possible. Palmetto branches brushed my shoulders. The deep sounds of my footfalls were only drowned out by my huffing and puffing. 

My left foot wedged itself underneath a root. As soon as I realized what was happening, I had already hit the ground. The little panicked breaths that had filled my lungs all rushed out in a single moment as my chest became well acquainted with the forest floor. My left hand scuffed against dirt and leaves, and my right palm grazed the surface of a moss-covered stone. If there was any air left in my lungs, I would have laughed at myself. That is until I realized my footsteps continued after I fell.

Call it delirium, call it adrenaline, but I could've sworn that as I was falling I could hear footsteps continuing in my pace. My cheek lying on the ground and eyesight serving me no good, I became intensely aware of the sounds and smells in my immediate vicinity. 

I heard nothing. No birds. No rodents. No twigs snapping. No rustling critters in the brush. Just the gentle breeze, whistling through the Palmetto branches and leaves. If only for a second the area reeked of ammonia and urine. A subtle presence of rotting fruit and eggs filled the air. Through the aches, and the pains I all of a sudden had the feeling like I was being watched. Like all at once, a colony of eyes transfixed on my crumpled heap. 

Fear froze me there in time. ""If it's black: fight back, if it's brown: lie down."" There aren't any brown bears in Florida as far as I know, so this is gonna have to be a fighting-back scenario. Unless the rules change if you're already lying down. There's only one way out of here and it's forward and if there is something in here it's behind me so I've got that going.

""Plink"" 

""What the hell was that,"" I thought to myself. 

""Plink""

It was closer this time. It sounded like something had fallen about three or 4 feet from my head.

""Plink""

""Shit,"" I instinctively muttered, breaking the unspoken rule of silence the forest had set upon me. I could see it now, a rock. A tiny little rock must have just landed right in front of my face.

""Plink""

I think something just lobbed a rock past my head.

The pain in my body all at once became the lowest priority I had. I pushed against the limestone and dirt, jolting my body upright. I spun to look for what lay in wait just behind my back.

Nothing.

No way in hell I was about to wait for whatever it was to show itself. Heart and mind racing at breakneck speed, my feet matched their tempo. I expertly dashed through the remaining trail. Rocks, holes, and branches were becoming more and more sparse. The back lip of my shoes ripped and tore at my Achilles tendon. My heart pounded and pounded until it felt like it was about to wriggle its way through my ribs and fall out. My lungs heaved air rapidly, the speed exasperated by the tremendous effort engaged by both my legs and amygdala. I could hear more footsteps than mine. I was being pursued. Instinct took over. Adrenaline guided my path and my conscious mind fell into complete blindness. I was no longer human. I was prey. I emerged at the trailhead moments later and it all flooded back. I peeked over my shoulder as I hit the road and ran back towards Naithlorendum. My pursuers had remained on the trail.

I scaled the strangled staircase and slammed the door behind me. The silence of the space was absolutely deafening. I leaned against the door and followed it down to the floor. I lay there for a short time. 

My mind flickered and adjusted back to reality. Fear had gripped each muscle fiber and tendon in my body. Reason began to administer its soothing medicine of denial.

The air was still, and frigid. I started to recognize some things not made all too clear by Deb. There's no air conditioning in this house. How does a house in the middle of Florida not have central heating and air? I went to the downstairs restroom to survey the damage. 
My palms were red and sore but altogether fine. I was covered in dirt and leaves, and there were a few deep scratches on my left cheek. I looked like hell but otherwise all right. I started running the sink so I could clean the cuts. I shook the dirt off my clothes into the bathtub. I winced taking off my left sneaker. I've never broken a toe before, but I know they're not supposed to be purple. 

I met my gaze in the mirror. "" What the hell was that?"" I folded up a sheet of toilet paper and dabbed cold water around the cuts that would distract from the dark circles under my eyes. I was tired, maybe even overtired.

""Was there anything there at all?"" A voice rose from the back of my head.

""No, no! I know what I saw.""

""What did you see?""

I couldn't answer that part of myself. I didn't actually see anything. But I knew what I heard.

""But what did you hear?""

Footsteps, the rock. I could—

""Rationally explain everything?""

The forest was dark, my adrenaline was pumping, and my mind could've been playing tricks on me. A coyote or less agreeably a panther could be a logical explanation. Any explanation though required too much mental gymnastics to make sense. My brain was already stiff and rigid and exercise was the last thing it needed. 

I would have gone out to my car to get my guitar to get my mind on something else, but there's a better chance of finding the winning lottery ticket in a haystack while being struck by lightning in a frozen-over Hell than me going back out there any time soon. I plopped onto the couch in front of the massive limestone fireplace. I needed to rest my eyes for a moment. Every blink fell heavier and heavier. The day's troubles exchanged the weight held by my heart to the eyelids.

I was out for 5 minutes. 

For the next hour, I explored the interior of my new job site. If the Pig Room was anything to go off of, there had to be more than what meets the eye. Dr.Gore was an established author and I found a few of his books in his study. Nothing on pigs. Aside from the swine's carnival of terrors placed directly over my head nothing seemed out of the ordinary. This tiny museum, a display of a man's life and passion, deep out in the sticks about 20 miles east of nowhere. What was the point of it all? Why keep it standing and open for visitors? These questions swirled in my psyche until one thought elbowed its way through the crowd and made itself a front-row seat in my mind.

""Why am I here?""

Tonight's wages would be the tipping point for me to afford health insurance this month, tomorrow's would pay for a week of meal kits. 
Not why I, personally, am here. Why would they have anyone here? What am I protecting and what am I protecting from? 

I'm just here to ""keep an eye on things"" right? This revelation bothered me as I mounted up to the very crest of the stairs and entered the cupola. As I paced circles around the observation deck another question had dispersed the crowd and made itself the only voice crying out in the wasteland of thought.

""Don't let the isolation get to you.""

Deb's final words to me were a harbinger of sorts. I limped up the stairs, purple-toed with an abrasion-littered face because I let it get to me. I was going mad. Paranoid. If I didn't have an immediate personality switch I wouldn't make it through the night.

""Plink.""

My blood ran cold. My temples pounded like a pair of timpani in a ritardando as my peripheral vision tightened down to a single point. Frozen in space and time, I waited for more noise. Five agonizingly slow minutes pass. I was surrounded on all sides by glass and on the other side of the glass nothing but the Spanish moss and darkness. A steady overcast of cumulonimbus had drowned the stars and dim crescent moonlight. Wind howled through the trees in a mighty crescendo until: ""plink.""
There is no way I imagined it because I saw it this time. I saw a pebble hit the window. I staggered back and became instantly aware of the fishbowl I had myself in. I decided the windowless room of the downstairs study would be safe, so I carefully climbed down the stairs. The soulless visage of the taxidermy bear shot me daggers as I made it to the second floor. I avoided the animals not wanting to get close. 

It had gotten even colder downstairs, a draft that sent goosebumps across my body. Rounding the welcome desk I snatched my phone from the charger. It hadn't charged, in fact, it was down to 20%. 

The wind was getting louder as I put my hand on the golden stanchion. A yellow-aged newspaper clipping on the desk caught my eye.

""December 19, 2000

Homeowner Shoots at Alleged Trespasser's Vehicle, One Teen Dead.""

I heard a rattling noise from the back of the house. It sounded like a branch on hurricane shutters. I ignored the study and crept towards the back of Naithlorendum. The window was open.

As the wind swept through the house I knew I wasn't alone. I was waiting for that little part of me, that thought my pursuer in the forest was a hallucination, to apologize. 

I heard a clattering noise upstairs. Like something had just tripped on one of the taxidermy projects. 

Eggs, fruit, ammonia, and urine. The scent had filled the air like a noxious perfume. It had found me.

""I don't care how much I'm getting paid, I'm not staying here another minute,"" I muttered as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned onto Desoto to make the hour-long trek back to civilization and out of this God-forsaken wood. I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Deb. 

""shit went down tonight. I don't know WTF is going on up here but I want no part of it. front gate closed and door if locked, key under the mat. If you knew what I was getting into im very disappointed"" 

Not delivered. I had no service at all now. While it was on my mind I attempted to send a message to Harvey: 
""hey bro, who the hell told you about this gig at the nature center? there is some crazy shit up here""

The Hyundai's brights illuminated the street, a bright white tunnel through the towering Pines. Mud, dust, and dirt kicked up and splattered against my car's already abused frame. Even with no one on the road I maintained 35 miles an hour. The scarlet beacon of my tail light illuminated a solitary figure dart across the street behind me. It was a child.

At two in the morning, on a back county road, deep in an old Florida state forest, a four-foot-tall child just ran behind my car, narrowly avoiding death.

Normally I would stop, but the woods couldn't pull one over me like that. It had gotten me out here but nothing was going to stop me. Something could slow me down. You see, most January's in Florida get one total day of rainfall. Well, apparently tonight was day two.
The sky's levee had overflowed and a free fall of rain engulfed my vehicle. My vehicle, the trees, and more importantly the dirt road. The rough and rocky terrain ahead began to mold and shift. My tires cut grooves into the earth as water began to break up the loam.

With full focus and attention on my surroundings, the corner of my vision caught something in the rearview.

The child was chasing my car.

At an inhuman speed, the silhouette steadily sprinted through the slurry kicking up behind my back tires. My fingers fumbled to switch that puppy into sport mode. I slammed my foot to the gas pedal and lurched forward. Anything not tied down had slipped and fell towards the back seat as I pumped the accelerator and gripped the steering wheel. The bumps in the road amplified, I had consecutive but sporadic airtime. The wipers spit rain and mud to either side. I glanced in the rearview. 

The child was galloping on all fours. Unbothered by the speed, by the mud, by the rain. The thing persisted. Its appendages moving with such fervor, its head pointed to the ground, it followed. It was gaining on me. 

I passed the skeletal remains of a deer on 130th.

I gripped the steering wheel as tightly as I could when I felt it start to get away from me. I was too late. I hydroplaned and spun out of control. I careened off the muddied road and narrowly missed a pine as I sailed off into a field. As I involuntarily did donuts in the clearing my brakes had finally pushed my car to a complete stop.

The pitter-patter drone of rainfall atop the car was the only thing I heard as my wrist vibrated informing me I had just been in an accident. I couldn't find my phone anywhere in the car. Fire ran down my neck, following my spine and distributing itself through my body and out my digits. In my rattled state I struggled to get my bearings, to focus on anything other than the contents of my stomach. I cut the engine, ""I'm gonna stay here a short while."" 

I sat there and worked the tension out of my hands. Breathe in, breathe out. I leaned back my head, placing my crown squarely on the headrest. Warm iron-tasting liquid had begun to seep from my tongue forming a small pool situated along my bottom row of teeth. 

""Plink""

""Plink, plink.""

""Plink, plink, plink.""

I jammed my thumb into the steering wheel as I sloppily and frantically reached for the ignition.

""Click-click-click.""

I pumped the stiff brake pedal and forced the key clockwise.

""Click-click-click""

Again.

""Click-click-click""

""Plink""

That one landed in the direct center of my windshield. As I shot my eyes up it darted out of my periphery. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, and now I could hear footsteps scampering about the car.

""Wham!"" It charged my passenger door. A deafening cacophony of thuds as it scaled my sunroof. The child leaped to the hood and stared directly at me.

""What the fuck is that-"" The words jumbled and twisted out of my mouth.

The child's grizzled brown fur was made slick by the rain and light of the moon. Its beady black eyes darted from me to the contents of my car and back to me. His little chest rising and falling as its cleft 4 fingered hands explored my windshield. It pressed its snout against the glass, grey and green plasma bubbling from its two gaping nostrils. 

I laid on my horn. Furiously beating the steering wheel and beeping in rapid protest.

It squealed. Frightened and angered by the noise it hopped and dug its tusk into my windshield before flailing and launching itself back into the dark. Scampering on all fours into the inky blackness of night. My windshield fractured, and I attempted to start the car again. My headlights flickered revealing the feral thing just ahead. The engine sputtered, struggling to start.

Guttural grunts and high-pitched whines filled the treeline. Every direction was engrossed by the war cry of wild hogs. 

Their squeals pierced my eardrums as a veritable tribe of bipedal swine emerged from the thicket. Of all sizes, some hairy, some nude, brown and black fur, tusks of varying lengths. Soulless eyes peered at my solitary island of machinery. They stumbled ahead, snorting and squealing as they closed the distance.

The hog people made their approach and I flooded my engine. 

""C'mon c'mon. Work damn it!"" I violently shook the steering wheel and beat a fist on my dashboard. ""Please! For the love of God!"" I shouted as one of the pigs snarled and charged the driver's side door.

The car lazily chugged to life and my dash illuminated. I pumped the accelerator and failed to budge as the first two hogs made contact with my car. 

One of the feral things hit my car with such force it left a bloodied snout print on my window. It stammered back and reached its 4 fingered hoof hand to the wound. It began to hungrily lap at its own blood.

At this sight, another larger beast stopped inches from the injured hog's face. Its snout twitched, examining the damage. The pig dashed its mighty tusk across the throat of the other and began biting at the hole.

At this, the pigs swarmed the dying creature. They voraciously ripped with their cleft appendages. Gnashing their teeth, and gnawing its sinewy flesh. Blood soaked the faces of the feasters. Squealing with delight as they dined upon one of their own. A dog pile of 15 or more three to four-foot-tall pig people were tearing the carcass clean at my door. Still, my car wouldn't budge.

The grizzly scene before me made it clear there was only one way out. I shot a hand to my glove box gripping a clump of McDonald's napkins. Drawing them close to my face I spat the small amount of blood that had pooled after the accident.  I carefully cracked the window and stuffed the bloody napkins in the crevice. I quickly rolled the window up, suspending my blood there above the frenzy. 

One particularly famished pig, that had been left on the outskirts of the feed, was kept through the crowd. Its snout twitched and it let out a deep and terrifying scream. 

One by one the feral hog men took notice of me. They turned their attention from the bones at their hooves and all pushed to sink their gaping maws onto my own warm flesh. All of their attention and focus, now dedicated to pushing and rocking my car from the driver's side. 

The car teetered and I braced as I was cut free from the mud. The Hyundai's engine roared as we charged from the field back to the main road.

I sailed down the loam and gravel with the hogs in hot pursuit. They galloped on all fours through the mud and blood.

I inched the window down. The blood-soaked napkins fluttered out of my vehicle and floated back behind the hogs. The things all stopped and twirled chasing the napkins. The pack of mutant pig people faded out of view, trading the dim red flood for darkness.

A final bump in the road was my sign I was nearing civilization. I had returned to the county-maintained road. At breakneck speeds I made record time getting back to Golden Gate Parkway. The black asphalt glistened on the freshly watered roadway. A few minutes later I pulled into the Waffle House on exit 101.

Ignoring the dents, the scratches, the fractures, the mud, and the blood; I grabbed my iPad from my guitar case. I scarfed down my eggs and sausage and began to write.

The sun's coming up now and the lady behind the counter has been giving me weird glances ever since I sat down. I don't know if anyone out there will believe what I saw out in the Picayune, but I know I have no reason to return to the blocks in the Golden Gate Estates anytime soon.

Just as I'm about to pay, I swear I see a rock plink against the restaurant window.

5’6”, age 39 
Started 12/16/24, 3, 36 hr fast weekly. Fast days are Monday, Wednesday and Friday 
On eat days I didn’t count calories or limit carbs. 
In the beginning I needed to use “fasting hacks”, aka dirty fasting, so if it was a tough moment I drank a cup of chicken bouillon broth, pickle juice or creamer in coffee. Now as of 4 weeks in, I don’t feel the need to use the “hacks” anymore. 
I’m turning 40 this year and currently 9 months postpartum, I’m ready to get back to feeling myself again. 

Background: 
I was over 200lbs for 10 years throughout my 20’s when I had my older children. On my 30th birthday I lost the weight to 160lbs and maintained that from 2017-2020. 
2020 I had started to gain and not care about my weight..(lot of stress with my home life during this time), 2022 and 2024 I had babies in my late 30’s, this really affected my body in many ways other than just excess weight. I weaned from breastfeeding in 08/2024 and began to implement fasting. I had no motivation, I was completely sleep deprived, (still am 🫠) and never stayed consistent. 
It was a week before Christmas, enough was enough and I started to complete the 36 hour fasts. I had lost 10lbs in one week and a pant size. That was enough fuel to keep me going. For this next month I plan to aim for lower carb on eat days and resist so many sweets.

Seemed like things were going well, so I asked her out on a date. She suggested a trivia night at a local coffee shop on Saturday night. Cool, sounds good, I love triva.

She chose a spot that was close to where she lives, about 45 minutes away from me. Not a problem; my work is in that area, so I'm very familiar with the commute. I try not to spend too much time on Facebook, so the last thing I texted her was my phone number, just in case she had any last minute updates. That was Thursday.

Some time on Friday, my Facebook Dating becomes inaccessible. When I go to in in the app, I get a message, ""It's not you, it's us. Something went wrong and we're working to make it better."" I assume there's a Facebook Dating outage, but no; after some Reddit searching, I realize that it's just me. It's just my profile that got fucked over and is inaccessible. It's something that happens to Facebook Dating users from time to time. The rest of Facebook works fine for me.

Hey, no worries, though; we made our plans and I'll just show up where and when we agreed. I get my haircut, I wash my car, I go about my day getting ready for the date.

The time arrives, and I make the long trek to see her. I walk in the door and our eyes lock; but she turns away like she doesn't recognize me. There's a reason for that. I walk over to her table and start talking to her. ""Hey, it's me! How's it going? "" yadda yadda yadda.

Now she recognizes me and there's an instant panic that comes over her face. ""You're not supposed to be here! You blocked me! I didn't think I was going to hear from you again!"" She's almost hysterical. I promised her that I never blocked her. I realize what happened; Facebook Dating COMPLETELY borked my account so that no one can even see my profile; everyone I was talking to, it's as if I blocked them.

I pulled out my phone and showed her the message on the screen. ""I never blocked you! Facebook messed up my dating profile!""

Well... the problem now is that she assumed I was ghosting her, and she invited her whole family over to the coffee shop for trivia night (including ex-husband and his new wife), and she was not prepared to have a first date with me in front of her entire family.

They all walked through the door, and now she's trying to do damage control, moving between them and me. ""Do we need to reschedule?"" I ask. ""Yes, please!"" she responds.

times that's not how i want to raise our daughter.  he'll hit her for counting wrong, not doing what he asked immediately, not listening, i mean anything she does wrong and he's slapping her across the face.  is a PFA my only hope?  i dont want him to have unsupervised time with her bc im scared he would hurt her to get back at me for leaving.  i've tried divorcing him before but he made it difficult and now recently he's told me he would never give me the satisfaction of divorce.  i was trying to stay as long as i could to pay off CC debt and my car but i don't think i can take it anymore.  what do i do?  where do i go?  i cant stay in a hotel forever because now my cats are home with him (if he goes back home) and he also abuses them.  (he spins them around on the floor to make them dizzy to chases him around and catches them to hit them).  im not perfect, i've hit him back in self defense and now im scared that kinda screwed me over.  i dont think i'll have money for a lawyer because i know he would just drag this out.

1i4nix4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i4nix4/i_slept_with_my_ex_husbands_best_friend/,I slept with my ex husbands best friend,"Backstory. My ex husband was abusive. We got divorced 2 years ago and I hadn’t talked to him or his best friend since then. His friend was also my friend and we were all 3 very close. 

Fast forward to now. I was out drinking by myself because I received some bad life changing news. I texted him (old friend) to tell him because I knew he was the only person who wouldn’t make me feel pitied and would just listen. He reads my text and immediately calls me and tells me that I shouldn’t be by myself and just to come over and stay in the guest room and we can just talk. 

I know what people are thinking, but intentions on both sides were completely pure. Neither of us expected this to happen. 

I go over there and he had also been drinking. He makes me another drink and we start watching a movie and talking about life. He tells me that he’s distanced himself from my ex because he found out what he did to me and just can’t view him the same anymore. He hugged me and apologized and just let me cry. There were a lot of emotions but I never once thought anything was going to happen. I tell him about my struggles and after an hour or two, he starts hugging me again and before I know it, he’s reaching down to kiss me and then we just can’t think or stop. 
It all happened so fast. I don’t know how to process it. I’m not a FWB or one night stand kind of person. I’ve never done something like this. I have no clue how to feel or anything. 

He was so sweet to me though. He cuddled me all night, made me coffee in the morning, started my car so it could warm up, and even walked me to my car when I had to go home. Now I’m spiraling and freaking out. I can’t get it out of my head. He is also trying not to freak out… it’s so confusing. 

I have no clue what to think, feel, say, or do. I don’t know how to process this at all. I’ll take any advice anyone has. ",1,1737252218.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

I haven’t asked for his age, but based on my judgement, I think there’s about a 10-18 year difference 

I met this man at the gym last summer and had good amount of interactions, with him usually initiating the conversations and he’d give me fist bumps when we see each other. A few weeks ago, we exchanged phone numbers, and the conversations have remained friendly. He kept asking me in person and in text for coffee. He didn’t mention it was a date, so to me it was more about getting to know each other casually, just as friends.

When we were planning for this coffee, I felt like I was doing most of the work in planning. I suggested the time, picked the café, and kept the conversation moving. He was responsive but didn’t contribute much to the decision-making. His involvement seemed passive, mostly agreeing to what I suggested rather than actively participating in the planning process. 

On the day of the coffee, he texted just little over an hour before the scheduled meeting time. I was almost done getting ready when he texted me. He explained the reason for the cancellation, it felt unclear and weak. It made me question his intentions and honesty, especially since things had seemed to be progressing in a positive direction.  He did apologize, but it didn’t feel very sincere. The way he approached rescheduling felt passive and vague. He didn’t suggest a specific time or take any initiative to make new plans. He left the decision up to me without much effort on his part to actually follow through. It came across as more of a casual remark than a real attempt to make plans.

My response to his text was clear and direct. I told him I was upset about the late notice and also felt inconsiderate for my time. I then said I wasn’t interested in rescheduling. His response felt dismissive and passive. Instead of taking responsibility or apologizing properly, he just accepted my decision without much emotion. It made it seem like he wasn’t really concerned about how his last-minute cancellation affected me.

He often started the texts and initiated conversations, both in person and by text, including asking to meet for coffee. I kept things friendly, but he took the lead. His text style was simple, using periods at the end of sentences, which makes his messages felt neutral and casual. Like he doesn’t add much emotion or detail to them. There was a noticeable difference between how he acted in person and how he communicated through text. In person, he came across as more engaging, warm, and personable, while his text style was more neutral, direct, and detached.",3,1737252208.0,AskMenAdvice,10,1.0,False

For context, I immigrated to the UK, lived most of my adult life in the north, so I have a broadly northern accent. My Fiancee, being southern, often pokes fun at me for it, but I wasn’t in the mood and said “Let me speak how I want”. She said it was a joke, and “You’ll run out of your drink quickly if you take a sip every time I put you in your place”. I questioned it at the time, she doubled down on it, but then food arrived and the day went on. Now I haven’t been able to sleep, I feel disrespected and it made me question whether I actually feel respected within the relationship.

I feel like I do more than my fair share in the relationship, but I don’t get the recognition for the work I put in. We recently bought a house together, and she was able to go part time at work to give us more time together. I work shifts, lots of early starts, late finishes and occasional nightshifts, so it’s given us a lot more time together. I make about 3x what she does, and I take care of the mortgage, all the bills and pay most of our dates and majority of our holidays, she pays for the occasional date and sends me about £400 a month for food/bills. I do all the meal planning, shopping and cooking (she doesn’t cook at all), when I’m at work I try to make sure there’s a cooked meal to reheat. I clean up after cooking and after dinner, if she leaves for work before me, I make her coffee to go, and get her lunch ready. We do most of the cleaning together, but when I have a day off, she usually asks me to do a bit while she’s at work. Laundry, house repairs, contractors etc. are usually my responsibility due to my hours. I get the thank you’s for dinner, getting her parcels or doing bits she asks me for, but it feels like most of my actual work goes under the radar, and if anything gets missed, I get the “Do we do it this way now??”

Now, our house is spotless, so I know she doesn’t just do nothing, but I feel like I definitely help a significant amount. It feels like I keep getting more and more piled on me, she’s asked me to start baking, so I dutifully make bread now. I get all the food for her cat with the shopping, but now it’s also my job to feed him whenever I am home.

Here’s where I’m hoping you guys can tell me - Yeah but you’re forgetting this, this and this - I can go ah ok, and go to sleep, but I really can’t see it, and I’m really struggling to see how I can do any more.

Tl;dr - I feel like I’m putting heaps of work into our relationship, but don’t feel it’s seen or respected

[**Singapore’s food culture**](https://islifearecipe.net/singapore-travel/) is globally renowned, a rich tapestry woven from its multicultural roots. From [**Michelin-starred**](https://islifearecipe.net/michelin-stars-malaysia-penang/) establishments to bustling hawker centres, food plays a central role in the nation’s identity: even down to UNESCO recognition. However, [**Singapore**](https://islifearecipe.net/singapore-travel/)’s shifting demographic landscape is reshaping this vibrant sector.

With an ageing population, increasing immigration, and evolving consumer expectations, the restaurant and hawker industries face challenges and opportunities.

[https://islifearecipe.net/](https://islifearecipe.net/)

**Mainland Chinese Influence: Hot Pot and Coffee Shop Chains**

A significant influx of mainland Chinese immigrants and billionaires has introduced new dimensions to Singapore’s food scene. High-profile Chinese [**hot pot**](https://islifearecipe.net/haidilao-hotpot-and-steamboat-review/) chains such as [**Haidilao**](https://humix.com/video/V5j1lnQq7A2) and Xiao Long Kan have established multiple outlets, drawing both local and expatriate crowds. Known for their interactive dining experiences, these [**hot pot**](https://islifearecipe.net/chao-niu-hot-pot-duo-galleria/) restaurants feature premium ingredients, customizable broths, and exceptional service standards, which have elevated the dining experience for many in Singapore.

With their high volume and streamlined operations, Chinese hot pot chains have captured a significant share of the dining market. These establishments appeal to a broad demographic, offering a communal dining experience that resonates with locals and immigrants. Their rapid expansion has created stiff competition for traditional fine dining establishments, which often operate on narrower margins and cater to a niche audience.

In addition to [**hot pots**](https://islifearecipe.net/haidilao-hotpot-and-steamboat-review/), Chinese coffee shop chains such as Luckin Coffee are beginning to make their mark. These cafes offer a modern take on coffee culture, combining affordability with sleek interiors and innovative drinks. Their rapid expansion reflects changing consumer preferences and highlights how [**Chinese**](https://islifearecipe.net/5-foolproof-chinese-stir-fry-recipes/) brands influence Singapore’s food and beverage landscape.

[https://islifearecipe.net/](https://islifearecipe.net/)

**Impact on Michelin-Starred and High-end Establishments**

While Singapore has long been a destination for high-end dining, recent years have seen a shift in the market dynamics. Renowned [**Michelin-starred**](https://islifearecipe.net/michelin-stars-malaysia-penang/) restaurants such as [**Cure**](https://islifearecipe.net/cure-michelin-star-review-chef-andrew-walsh/), Sommer, Braci, Table65, Chef Kang’s Private Kitchen, and high-end restaurants such as [**Tippling Club**](https://islifearecipe.net/tippling-club/), Chef’s Table, and [**Kubo**](https://islifearecipe.net/kubo-singapore-woodfired-kitchen-review/) have sadly closed their doors with potential plans to open in [**Malaysia**](https://islifearecipe.net/malaysia-travel/), [**Bali**](https://islifearecipe.net/indonesia-travel/), and [**the Philippines**](https://islifearecipe.net/philippines-travel/). Industry insiders attribute this trend to changing consumer preferences, the high cost of operations, and increased competition from more accessible dining options like hot pot chains.

Restaurateurs and chefs say that a limited market, a shortage of labour and high rental and food costs are some of the challenges that fine-dining restaurants grapple with.

One restaurant founder recently stated: *“The profit margins of fine-dining restaurants is a single digit percentage due to the fixed overheads of everything from food and labour to even water.”* He added that restaurants in [**Hong Kong**](https://islifearecipe.net/best-hong-kong-five-day-itinerary/) receive sufficient business to operate seven days a week, but those in Singapore, function more on a five-day-a-week basis.

Fine dining enthusiasts in Singapore have been facing continued disappointment as more and more notable restaurants close their doors: 1/ Two-Michelin-starred Restaurant Andre, known for Nouvelle French cuisine, closed its doors after an eight-year run. 2/ Three-Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon and its sister restaurant, the two-Michelin-starred L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon, shocked diners by closing at Resorts World [**Sentosa**](https://islifearecipe.net/scentopia-review-sentosa/), though the latter hinted at a potential reopening in a new location: likely Malaysia or Indonesia. 3/ Hashida Sushi, a highly regarded Japanese restaurant at Mandarin Gallery, also confirmed its closure after five years of operation. 4/ Italian restaurants Osteria Mozza and Pizzeria Mozza, both associated with renowned American chefs Nancy Silverton and Mario Batali, also served their final meals at [**Marina Bay Sands**](https://islifearecipe.net/marina-bay-sands-review-blog/), ending their eight-year presence in Singapore.

Head of research for Singapore and Southeast Asia at CBRE, said: *“Singapore diners have the palate but not the wallet when it comes to fine dining. They tend to mix up worth with value. It is a niche and transient market that depends on waves such as the Formula 1 racing season.”*

**Comparing Singapore to Penang**

Meanwhile, Penang in [**Malaysia**](https://islifearecipe.net/malaysia-travel/) has become a burgeoning hub for fine dining, boasting [**68 Michelin-starred restaurants**](https://islifearecipe.net/michelin-stars-malaysia-penang/) as of recent counts. Penang’s thriving food scene is fueled by a balance between preserving traditional flavours and embracing high-end innovation. Unlike Singapore, where high operational costs, regulated hiring of Singaporean staff, and shifting preferences have created challenges, Penang benefits from a lower cost of living and a strong focus on promoting local gastronomy.

[https://islifearecipe.net/michelin-stars-malaysia-penang/](https://islifearecipe.net/michelin-stars-malaysia-penang/)

The influx of Chinese hot pot chains has not impacted Penang’s fine dining sector as significantly as in Singapore. [**Penang’s Michelin-starred**](https://islifearecipe.net/malaysia-travel/) establishments have managed to coexist alongside affordable local food options, creating a diverse and sustainable dining ecosystem. This contrast highlights the need for Singapore’s fine dining sector to adapt and find ways to coexist as well with emerging food trends.

**Ageing Population and Its Effects on Hawker Culture**

Hawker culture is a cornerstone of Singapore’s heritage, but its sustainability is under threat as the average age of hawkers rises, and rental increases skyrocket. Many of these seasoned food vendors are nearing retirement, and a significant number struggle to find successors willing to take over their stalls. Younger generations often opt for careers with higher incomes, more predictable hours, and less physically demanding work. The National Environment Agency’s (NEA) reports indicate that many hawker stalls face closure when their operators retire, jeopardizing traditional dishes that are an essential part of Singapore’s identity.

[https://islifearecipe.net/hawker-review/](https://islifearecipe.net/hawker-review/)

**The Rise of Next-Generation Hawkers**

Despite these concerns, there’s a silver lining. A wave of younger hawkers has begun entering the scene, bringing with them creativity and entrepreneurial spirit: places like [**The Bedok Marketplace**](https://islifearecipe.net/the-bedok-marketplace/)**,** and [**Cosford Container Park**](https://islifearecipe.net/3rd-visit-cosford-container-park-lunch-to-dinner/). These next-generation vendors are reinventing traditional hawker fare by incorporating global influences and modern culinary techniques. For example, some stalls now offer fusion dishes like Japanese-style char kway teow or Korean-inspired laksa. Additionally, technology adoption — such as online ordering platforms and cashless payment systems — has helped modernize the hawker experience, attracting a younger, tech-savvy audience.

**Immigration and Its Influence on the Food Industry: Diversifying Palates**

Singapore’s position as a global business hub has attracted a diverse expatriate population, which in turn has influenced local food offerings. Restaurants and cafes catering to international tastes have flourished, offering everything from [**Middle Eastern mezze**](https://islifearecipe.net/aniba-singapore/), and authentic [**Italian pasta**](https://islifearecipe.net/sospiri-authentic-south-italian-restaurant/) to a proliferation of [**Spanish fine dining**](https://islifearecipe.net/best-spanish-restaurants-singapore/) and tapas and their [**Mexican**](https://islifearecipe.net/mexican-tacos/) cousins.

This trend not only broadens the city’s gastronomic landscape but also introduces locals to new flavours and dining styles. Popular neighbourhoods like Katong, [**Siglap**](https://islifearecipe.net/burma-social-review-siglap/) and Bedok have seen a rise in international restaurants, thanks to their popularity among expatriates.

[https://islifearecipe.net/](https://islifearecipe.net/)

**Dining as an Experience**

Younger diners, including millennials and Gen Z, value unique dining experiences. Restaurants and hawkers are adapting by offering [**Instagram-worthy**](https://www.instagram.com/islifearecipe/) presentations, thematic settings, and immersive dining concepts. For example, [**Cosford Container Park**](https://islifearecipe.net/cosford-container-park-weekend/)[ ](https://islifearecipe.net/cosford-container-park-weekend/)featuring live music and hawker stalls with vibrant, art-filled decor has become popular. This shift reflects a growing emphasis on the overall experience rather than just the food.

**Government Initiatives to Support the Food Industry**

**Revitalizing Hawker Culture**

The Singaporean government has recognized the importance of preserving [**hawker**](https://islifearecipe.net/hawker-centre-near-me-siglap/)[ ](https://islifearecipe.net/hawker-centre-near-me-siglap/)culture and has implemented programs to support it. These include mentorship schemes for aspiring hawkers, subsidies for rental costs, and training courses focused on business management and food preparation. The Hawkers’ Development Programme by NEA, for example, pairs veteran [**hawkers**](https://islifearecipe.net/hawker-centre-near-me-siglap/#east-coast-lagoon-food-village) with apprentices to ensure knowledge transfer.

**Modernizing Infrastructure**

Efforts to upgrade [**hawker centres**](https://islifearecipe.net/hawker-centre-near-me-siglap/#east-coast-lagoon-food-village) have also played a significant role in their survival. Enhanced facilities, better hygiene standards, and improved seating arrangements make these centres more appealing to a wider demographic. The introduction of ***hawkerpreneur incubation stalls*** allows newcomers to test their business ideas in a supportive environment.

[https://islifearecipe.net/](https://islifearecipe.net/)

**Conclusion**

The changing demographics of Singapore — from an ageing population to a growing expatriate community — are reshaping the city’s restaurant and hawker industries. These shifts present both challenges and opportunities, prompting innovation while testing the resilience of traditional practices. Through government support, entrepreneurial spirit, and community appreciation, Singapore’s food scene continues to adapt and thrive. As the nation embraces these changes, its food culture remains a vibrant and integral part of its identity.",1,1737252006.0,u_Low_Pitch_2786,0,1.0,False

I’m a 28-year-old from Europe, and I’m here looking for a connection that feels authentic—something built on shared understanding, good conversations, and maybe even a little magic. Whether we start with a friendly chat or dive into the bigger questions of life, I’m open to seeing where the journey takes us.

# A Bit About Me

* **Who I Am:** I’m a writer at heart—someone who’s fascinated by the world’s little details and always looking to capture its fleeting moments in words. I believe there’s poetry in everyday life if you look close enough. I’d describe myself as curious, introspective, and quietly optimistic.
* **My Interests:**
   * **Music:** I’m on a journey to become a vinyl collector (once I have the space for it!). I love crafting playlists that feel like soundtracks to moments in life, and I’m always hunting for new tracks that speak to the soul.
   * **Nature and Exploration:** Whether it’s hiking to catch a golden-hour view, wandering unfamiliar streets, or just stargazing on a clear night, I’m happiest when I’m exploring.
   * **Creativity:** I’ve been dabbling in photography lately, trying to turn fleeting scenes into lasting memories. Writing has always been my first love, but this new creative outlet is giving it some competition.
   * **Gaming and Relaxing:** On quieter days, I enjoy diving into a good game or settling in for a movie marathon—it’s all about balance, right?

# What I’m Looking For

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s as curious about life as I am. Here’s what I’d love in a partner:

* **Kindness:** You lead with your heart and care about the people around you. You’re the kind of person who finds joy in small gestures and values connection over pretense.
* **Curiosity:** You see the world as a big, wonderful puzzle to explore—whether that’s through travel, learning something new, or simply seeing the beauty in the everyday.
* **Openness:** Life is full of surprises, and you’re not afraid to embrace them. You’re willing to share your dreams, your quirks, and maybe even your favorite coffee order.
* **Partnership:** Someone who wants to build something together—a shared world full of laughter, quiet moments, and spontaneous adventures.

# Why Message Me?

I’d like to think I bring a unique mix of thoughtfulness and enthusiasm to the table. I’ll remember the little things about you—the way your favorite song makes you smile, the dreams you’re too shy to share, or the stories that light up your eyes. I’m loyal, steady, and the kind of person who shows up for the big moments and the small ones.

I believe in the magic of connection. Whether it’s through a shared playlist, a midnight chat, or a day spent exploring something new, I want to create moments that matter—moments that turn into memories we’ll always carry.

# Let’s Start a Story

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let’s talk about music, share our favorite books, or dream up an imaginary trip to the most beautiful place we can think of. Or maybe we’ll just start with “hello” and see where the conversation takes us.

An excruciatingly long day full of fear and anxiety passed before we heard back from Rebecca. She had messaged us asking to meet in person after we described our situation in detail but warned us in advance that she does not know how helpful she would be. The drive to the address she'd given us was about an hour and a half away in Augusta where she had a small apartment she was staying at currently. Connor and I walked to the hotel to find my car still there, but his had disappeared.

We kept a close eye on our wounds or bruises, unsure of what they actually were, and if they could spread we were relieved to see they still hadn't. I'd like to say we discussed theories and possible reasons for why this was happening, and why to us, but we were so afraid and exhausted by now that we barely said anything to each other. I'd spoken to my family on the phone earlier and had to pretend everything was okay when deep down I wanted to cry into the receiver to my mother and ask her what to do. Anything we tried to find regarding the missing police officers who responded to the call that night online was met with old articles that coincidentally had some of the same keywords I'd used in my search. There was nothing on the news either. It was as if nothing had happened at all.

We arrived in Augusta a little after noon and turned from the main street to town into another narrow road that led to Rebecca's neighborhood. We climbed up to the third floor and rung her bell, footsteps approaching the door a few moments later and stopping, presumably looking through the large peephole before she opened the door to greet us. What we saw in person was a woman slightly older than the one on the website, so I assumed the photo must have been taken some years ago.

""Good afternoon. I assume you're Marielle and Connor?"" She pushed the door open fully now and looked at me first, then at him.

""Yes, thank you for having us miss Simmons... we're not sure who we can even turn to about this."" Connor nodded and then brought his head down slightly as if admitting defeat.

""Nobody, I hate to tell you. You're not the first to come to me about something like this, but you're probably the only ones to have..."" She seemed hesitant to finish her sentence but did so after a brief pause. ""...survive.""

Connor and I turned to meet our eyes and Rebecca invited us in, apologizing for saying what she did and shut the door behind us once we'd entered. She went to make us coffee while we took our shoes and jackets off and made ourselves comfortable in her living room and I tried taking some of the stress off by petting her puppy, a French Bulldog that couldn't have been older than a few months.

""They allow pets in the building?"" I tried initiating small talk when she came back to set a friendlier tone before we got to what we were really here for.

""You can say that, honestly the owner is against animals of any kind in the apartments but I convinced him how little trouble he'd cause and that if he broke or damaged anything I'd pay back in full. Isn't that right, Frankie?""

In response, Frankie mustered up a semi-bark and licked her hand as she went to pet his head and then sat down on the opposite side of the sofa me and Connor were on, on a small cushioned chair.

""I know who you are, Marielle."" I must admit that phrase almost sent me into fight or flight considering I've been on edge to say the least for the past little over two days and was ready to jump up and run out of the apartment, but she continued just in time to allow me to prevent myself from doing so. ""Your husband contacted me a year ago trying to find out more about the mirror world and the creatures inhabiting it. I'm sorry to hear what happened and that you had to relive it writing it in the email...""

Her mentioning my ex husband's death was a gut punch as I still hadn't even started processing it over the weight of everything that's happened, and I stared blankly at her. Connor noticed and took over the conversation for me.

""Did he mention anything we might need to know? Why was he trying to break into Marielle's home?""

Rebecca took a sip from her coffee which still had steam coming off of it and switched her gaze to me, picking up Frankie off the floor once he jumped off as soon as I stopped petting him, obviously completely disinterested in me now, and set him in her lap.

""Because he was afraid of exactly what is happening to you. I can't put this any other way so I will be forward about it, Russel did not seem exactly in his... right mind, even back then. He was talking about all kinds of theories and supposed discoveries he had made that sounded like the ravings of a madman, but what was evident to me was his duty to protect you from it, Marielle. I assume that's why he was there that night, but he was unlucky enough to encounter something that only appeared to be you."" Both Connor and I were at a loss for words at how casually this woman seemed to be talking about this, as if it was an everyday occurrence that some body snatchers who apparently lived in your damn mirror or something like that took over your life and pretended to be you, but that didn't stop her from continuing. ""Admittedly though he was one of the few to have actually come to me with more than just claims of there being another version of them.""

""So what the hell are these things? Why are they targeting us?"" Connor said, not even having touched his coffee yet. Not that I did either.

""I don't know for sure how they choose their hosts as I call them, but from what Russel and others before and after him have told me is that they form when you feel lost for an extended period of time in your life, like when a piece of you seems to be missing. Is that description accurate for you after your divorce, Marielle?""

Part of me was getting more and more furious at how confidently this woman was trying to gouge the low points in my life but I could not bring myself to go against her when everything she'd been saying so far was correct, and it didn't help that she sounded so confident... well, maybe it did, because we were finally talking to someone who not only believed us but seemed experienced in the topic at hand.

""It... it does. And I guess the same goes for Russel, he started talking about all this a month after his father passed in a tragic work accident. I thought he was just taking the loss really bad but... my God."" I took a moment to think everything through and allowed myself to finally take a sip from the coffee Rebecca had made me before continuing. ""You said he had made some kind of discovery when he'd come to you? What were you talking about?""

""Well, I don't know if your husband had ever come in contact with any of them, but according to him the only way to sever these beings' connection to you was to destroy them in their own world. I'll be honest that I was up until very recently skeptical about its existence as a whole, considering no one had ever actually been to it, or at least done that and returned to tell the tale, but here you two are. And you have evidence."" She held her hand up to her ribcage while also looking at my ankle, referring to the dark marks Connor and I had. I'm sure he felt as unnerved as I did at the mention of them.

""And what do these markings mean? Do you know?"" Connor joined in.

""My theory is that it's this other reality's way to manifest itself into our own. I can't tell you what that means or how dangerous it may be, but I hope nobody has to find out."" She put Frankie back on the ground and he tried to get her attention again by scratching on her left leg for a second before making a sound like an angry toddler and curling up by her feet, then Rebecca leaned on her knees and her eyes darted from Connor's to mine and back. ""I know that this will sound like suicide, but you were already there once - you twice even, Connor - and you both managed to escape. In all my time following this phenomenon I've not heard or met anyone to have done that. I'd say that it's your decision if you wanted to to this, but with those marks you have, I'm not sure if you have any choice in the matter if you want to... stay. You must go back and destroy your impostors before they claim you.""

I don't have to explain how hard my stomach dropped as we were literally instructed to go back into that damned maze that took the form of my home, but at the same time there was no other solution we could think of, and I am sure it had been floating around Connor's head as much as it had been in mine recently.

""But... how do we even go about doing it? We don't know what they even are, how are we supposed to *fight* them?"" My voice trembled at the mention of a confrontation with them.

""We don't call them mirror people just because we came up with it randomly, Marielle. You came out of that world through your mirror. You see how they are trying to become you, slowly. So..."" Rebecca stood up and walked over to one of the walls of the apartment that had a large rectangular mirror on it. ""My guess is that attacking them with glass will be effective in hurting and potentially killing them.""

""Your *guess*?"" Connor stood up and I felt the disbelief in his words as if they were my own. ""You're telling us to enter whatever that place is again, most likely walking straight to our death or, God knows, maybe something even worse, and all you have to go off of is your *guess*?""

She turned back to face him seemingly unaffected by his demeanor and crossed her arms before speaking.

""Like I said, I've never encountered one of them myself and am only going off of what I've heard by people I've spoken to both in person and through my forum. If it makes you feel better, I am more than willing to come with you. I've been investigating this for far too long and I want to be able to help others in your situation, if they ever come to find me.""

""So you are saying this isn't just happening to... me? It's a whole phenomenon? When was the first time something like this happened?""

""I can't tell you for sure, Marielle."" Rebecca shrugged and now turned her whole body to face us, and Connor shook his head while sitting down but remained silent. ""But you are not the only one being haunted by yourself. You might realize now though why it's not a widespread threat - people who look for help from those not familiar with it end up ostracized or thrown in mental hospitals.""

We stayed at Rebecca's apartment for another half an hour, going through Connor's and my experience in the mirror world and then getting ready to leave and drive back to my house... it sounds just as insane as it did then typing this out. Our conversation on the drive back, with Connor in the driver seat this time, was mostly filler or silence. As much as I didn't want to admit it because she was still helping us, Rebecca was not a great person to be around and I can see why she'd be doing something so out of the ordinary considering how apathetic she seemed to people's emotions and the second thing I was looking forward to the most after freeing myself of the other me's torment was not having to spend another second with her.

After she gave us some more information and theories about what we have to do, we came to the conclusion that we had to get rid of mine and Connor's double in order to sever our link to this other reality, or dimension, or how you want to call it. We decided that we would do our best to destroy those of the two policemen who disappeared in response to the call if we found them, and I'm sorry if this makes me sound like a bad person, but I was not ready to spend more time in that hell of a place trying to save someone I did not know, and I just wanted it to be over already, and I think Rebecca was the only one who despite all her supposed experience failed to realize that we were literally about to enter another dimension to fight beings that were nothing close to human when she urged us to make it our goal to find them as well.

Arriving at my driveway was just as chilling as before, the eeriness amplified by the police car still outside. On our way, we'd passed by a store to buy a medium sized mirror that we broke in order to arm ourselves with shards of its glass, an idea suggested by Rebecca that I was not sure how it made me feel when you take into account the superstitions around the bad luck that will follow you when you break a mirror. She seemed to not care and was more than happy to shatter it without a second thought, of course getting herself the longest and sharpest piece she could find and leaving us with shorter ones.

We explained to Rebecca that going up into the attic is what sent both Connor and I into the other world, and he was the first to go up the ladder, then Rebecca, and finally myself.

All three of us commented on the sudden chill and cold of the attic and then slowly descended back into the hallway to find nothing out of the ordinary until the first time a room repeated, but what was stranger than usual was how the distortions appeared almost instantaneously , with floating or half-missing furniture, misplaced windows and the like.

“I can't believe I am actually seeing this myself...” For a change, this time Rebecca sounded like the one completely lost in the situation. I don't know about Connor, but it made me feel more in control, like I knew what to expect. Of course, I didn't.

“Okay, listen to me.” I tried to sound as confident as I could to grab their attention. “I have an idea, we can walk all we want and expect to find one of those things, or we can draw them to us. While I was here, when I made a noise they came almost instantly, so let's devise a plan.”

I looked around the room we were currently in – it was the kitchen, a perfect place for an ambush. I'd stay behind the counter by the window, looking towards the doorway, on the either side of which Connor and Rebecca would wait with glass shards in hand to stab them into whichever creature came first. They agreed to the plan and took their positions while I looked into one of the shelves floating in the middle of the air, inside of which were small glass cups, not behind on defying the laws of physics.

Looking back at the others and raising the cup in the air, they nodded in approval and I took a deep breath and braced myself, squeezing my shard in the other hand. Before I dropped the glass I looked at the mark on my hand, which seemed to have grown to almost consuming my entire palm. We had to get this done, or who knows what would follow us.

I simulated a pained yell as I threw the glass onto the ground and seconds later the all too familiar static and distant voices started storming towards the kitchen from the other room. Turning the corner was a man in a police uniform, I assume one of the two that were unlucky enough to be sent as the responders the night I got the call. It took all the strength in me not to flinch as its what were up until now stiff movements turned into a feral sprint accompanied by a reverberating inhuman growl.

The moment that thing appeared through the doorway, Connor and Rebecca were swift to stab their shards into its body. Connor managed to slice into its abdomen while Rebecca jammed hers straight into its right eye. Moments later, the awful sound it somehow produced was cut like a TV turning off, and it began cracking until eventually shattering into pieces that littered the floor.

The three of us looked at each other in disbelief. We'd just killed one of those things, and without it even being able to reach us. For the first time, I felt strong, triumphant, like I was going to be the one that THEY should be afraid of.

That was short lived.

The only form of celebration we were able to have was momentary looks of widened eyes and smiles, before the sounds returned. The footsteps, the screaming, the static. So many sets of footsteps, so much static. Rebecca gasped and Connor held his free hand up to his ear and shut his eyes tight while I backed away from the counter.

In that moment of fear, I forgot about the broken window.

Before I could see what was about to come through the door I was pulled back by my hair so hard that for a second I thought my scalp was about to rip. I could only keep myself on my feet for less than two seconds, calling out for help before my spine slammed against the bottom frame of the window and I went limp just long enough to be pulled into the bedroom it was looking into and thrown across half its length, rolling across the floor.

I could hear the commotion in the kitchen the whole time, Rebecca screamed while Connor was silent but I could hear objects being thrown into the walls and an occasional grunt that I assumed came from him. I did my best to stand up as quickly as possible, and that's when I realized my glass shard was gone, likely I dropped it when I was grabbed.

I opened my eyes to instantly be met with the sight of the other Marielle standing a few feet away from me with her mouth opened impossibly revealing her entire bottom row of teeth but no tongue, and her eyes – two different colors, just like Connor had told me. She produced the same horrifying scream, but it wasn't mixed with any static, it sounded exactly like me, but as if I was being brutally torn apart, like I was being tortured in the most awful of ways possible.

Looking around the bedroom, I realized there was nothing I could use as a weapon, and by the time I did, the other Marielle had started her charge at me again and I screamed, barely managing to slip past her and throw myself onto the bed. I reached for the pillow and through horrified, panicked inhales and exhales I threw it at her, which as you may imagine was not a very effective weapon, and I crawled back, gasping as I fell over at the other side.

Standing up as fast as I could I was met with the awful sight of her crawling onto the bed like a spider, but that was not what disturbed me most – her head, mouth still hanging open so painfully and eyes empty like a dark abyss, her head was throwing itself into impossible angles just like that thing pretending to be Connor had been doing while I was hiding. I tried to make my way to the other corner of the room but she pounced on me, pinning me to the ground and with inhuman strength she gripped my neck and lifted me up, slamming me into the wall, and as I looked into her, parts of her 'skin' started going black.

While I was still running I heard the sound of glass shattering through the window. When the other Marielle had me pinned, I heard Connor shouting and a chair suddenly hit my double and it released its grip on me. That moment allowed me to look into the kitchen and see Connor being tackled by his double and disappearing out of sight, and Rebecca...

Rebecca was held against the wall by another creature in the skin of a police officer, but her hand was raised and she was holding her glass shard still – all she had to do was drive it into its head and she would have freed herself, but that thing was too fast and stopped her arm mid-air with its own, squeezing so hard it caused her to drop the shard and scream in pain, all of this happening in less than a second, and then it dropped her arm and put its palm against her mouth.

What I witnessed after that, was the total disappearance of that thing's... everything. It was just a totally black silhouette that resembled a human with impossibly uneven proportions, constantly swapping, but the only thing that stayed consistent was the arm with which it held onto Rebecca's mouth. Its palm then moved from just covering her mouth to grabbing her entire head, and she let out a guttural scream that only got louder and louder as it tightened its grip.

I couldn't see anything more, as I still had the other me to deal with. While looking into the kitchen an idea came to me – I could lure this Marielle towards the window and use its pieces of glass to shatter her.

And that is what I did, I sprinted as fast as I could to the window and turned back to see she was already running for me. Her hands were out trying to grab me, and I ducked right before she was able to and moved to the right, causing her to ram in front of the window and into its frames.

It was now or never. I turned around and gathered all the strength I had left to grab the other Marielle's head and slam it into the sharp piece of glass pointing right up. She was able to release one final shriek before it pierced into her left eye and she stood there, frozen and silent.

At that moment I looked up to see what was happening inside the kitchen and saw that Rebecca had completely disappeared while Connor was still in a tussle with his double. I was just about to crawl through the window back to help, before I was forced down on the floor by an awful, throbbing pain in my ankle, hand, and now neck, where the other Marielle had held me up.

But the pain was soon to disappear and I looked back up towards the window where my double was beginning to crack, and I called out for Connor one last time before she turned to pieces, and my memories end there.

What I remember immediately after was waking up in a hospital bed with an IV going into my left hand and I was covered by a sheet. I was so exhausted I could barely produce any sound that alerted a visitor I did not know I had sitting on a chair by the bed.

“Easy, Marielle.” The voice was that of a woman and it would certainly have made me scream if I had the strength for it. “You've been out the longest out of us three.”

I slowly turned my head to see Rebecca smiling at me with this expression that had something off about it, but I choked it up to condition.

“Rebecca? What happened?”

“We did what we had to do is what happened. But you were completely out of it when we came out.”

I was too worried about Connor to ask what she meant by “came out”, I was definitely in need of a memory freshener.

“Where is Connor? Is he okay?”

“Oh yes, honey, don't worry about him. He's in a neighboring room. You two had a real struggle in there.” She then stood up, and at that moment I could not remember how she had suddenly disappeared while we were in that place. She made her way to the door and opened it, stepping out. “You'll have to ask the nurses if you can see him though.”

“Wait, Rebecca!” I called out weakly. “How did we-- is it over?”

“I'll tell you later, Marielle, visiting time is over and I need to feed Toby, you know, he's probably starving by now. You know how much Frenchies eat.”

Before I could question her more she shut the door and I was left alone, for the first time completely alone and separated from Connor since he offered me his help. I was afraid for him, and I wanted to see him, but at least I had Rebecca's word that he was okay.

I moved the covers to look at my hand and ankle – the parts where I'd been marked were covered in bandages and I had no idea what was under there, and when I ran my other hand over the front of my neck I confirmed that the case was the same with it too. I was sure that if they'd remained like that, I had a lot of explaining to do, and I wasn't sure how I was going to go about it, but I had the chance to finally rest, and I wasn't about to say no to it.

Not long after a male nurse entered my room with a tray of food and smiled under his mask. “Hello, miss. I was told you were awake. You were in quite the condition when we got to you, it was a stroke of luck your neighbors saw you before you'd lost too much blood.”

“Blood? What happened to me?” I recalled the black marks again and ran my hand over the bandages on my neck.

“You had some really deep wounds where the bandages are and you neighbors' son saw you passed out on the driveway, bleeding. Poor kid, but he saved your life.”

“Is Connor here? Can I see him? He... he was with me.”

The nurse looked at me confused and scratched his head. “Ma'am, there was no one with you, and we don't have a patient by that name in the ward.”

I raised my eyebrows and felt myself begin to tense. “That's impossible, he was with me! Check again, please. I was with two other people, that lady and Connor. Please just check again.”

“Okay ma'am, okay. Just don't stress yourself out, please, you really need to rest and keep yourself steady. I'll be back in just a few moments.” He smiled and nodded at me before turning around and leaving the room, but I was too nervous for pleasantries right now.

I started to wonder why Rebecca was in such a rush, and why she'd lie about Connor if he wasn't here. I'd remembered by now how she suddenly went missing while I was still inside that place, but I thought that just like how I'd suddenly returned to the real world after I killed the other me, the same thing must have happened to her... but there wasn't another her, right?

That's when I replayed our conversation over a few times in my head before she left, and I kept stopping at one detail in particular - was I misremembering it, or did she get the name of her dog wrong?",17,1737251570.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

For context, I immigrated to the UK, lived most of my adult life in the north, so I have a broadly northern accent. My Fiancee, being southern, often pokes fun at me for it, but I wasn’t in the mood and said “Let me speak how I want”. She said it was a joke, and “You’ll run out of your drink quickly if you take a sip every time I put you in your place”. I questioned it at the time, she doubled down on it, but then food arrived and the day went on. Now I haven’t been able to sleep, I feel disrespected and it made me question whether I actually feel respected within the relationship.

I feel like I do more than my fair share in the relationship, but I don’t get the recognition for the work I put in. We recently bought a house together, and she was able to go part time at work to give us more time together. I work shifts, lots of early starts, late finishes and occasional nightshifts, so it’s given us a lot more time together. I make about 3x what she does, and I take care of the mortgage, all the bills and pay most of our dates and majority of our holidays, she pays for the occasional date and sends me about £400 a month for food/bills. I do all the meal planning, shopping and cooking (she doesn’t cook at all), when I’m at work I try to make sure there’s a cooked meal to reheat. I clean up after cooking and after dinner, if she leaves for work before me, I make her coffee to go, and get her lunch ready. We do most of the cleaning together, but when I have a day off, she usually asks me to do a bit while she’s at work. Laundry, house repairs, contractors etc. are usually my responsibility due to my hours. I get the thank you’s for dinner, getting her parcels or doing bits she asks me for, but it feels like most of my actual work goes under the radar, and if anything gets missed, I get the “Do we do it this way now??”

Now, our house is spotless, so I know she doesn’t just do nothing, but I feel like I definitely help a significant amount. It feels like I keep getting more and more piled on me, she’s asked me to start baking, so I dutifully make bread now. I get all the food for her cat with the shopping, but now it’s also my job to feed him whenever I am home.

Here’s where I’m hoping you guys can tell me - Yeah but you’re forgetting this, this and this - I can go ah ok, and go to sleep, but I really can’t see it, and I’m really struggling to see how I can do any more.

Thanks <3

If you think ATMs are only good for spitting out paper money, think again! Welcome to the world of Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs), where cash meets crypto in the ultimate financial handshake. Pair that with our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** ([https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)), and you’ve got yourself a recipe for seamless, futuristic transactions. Whether you’re buying Bitcoin, selling it, or just flexing your crypto-savvy muscles, this duo is here to make your life easier, funnier, and a whole lot cooler.

So, grab your virtual wallet, buckle up, and let’s dive into the marvelous mashup of Bitcoin ATMs and QR codes!

# What’s the Deal with Bitcoin ATMs?

Imagine a traditional ATM, but instead of dispensing boring old banknotes, it gives you the golden ticket of the digital age: Bitcoin. That’s a Bitcoin ATM in a nutshell! Here’s what makes them tick:

* **Buy and Sell Bitcoin**: Most BTMs let you purchase Bitcoin with cash or sell it for cash. It’s the crypto equivalent of a corner store.
* **User-Friendly**: Even your tech-averse uncle could figure out how to use one. (Okay, maybe with a little help.)
* **Instant Gratification**: No waiting for days for your transaction to clear. BTMs are all about real-time satisfaction.
* **Global Presence**: With thousands of Bitcoin ATMs popping up worldwide, you’re never too far from one.

But here’s the twist: while BTMs are straightforward, they thrive on QR codes. That’s where our hero, the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App**, swoops in to save the day.

# The Dynamic Duo: BTMs and QR Codes

QR codes are the unsung heroes of the crypto universe. They’re fast, foolproof, and look like modern art—if modern art were designed by robots. Here’s why QR codes and BTMs are a match made in crypto heaven:

1. **Ease of Use**: QR codes eliminate the need to manually type out wallet addresses. (Who has time for typos?)
2. **Security**: Scanning a QR code ensures your Bitcoin goes exactly where it’s supposed to, with no room for error.
3. **Speed**: A quick scan, and you’re good to go. It’s faster than waiting for your coffee order.

Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** ([https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)) takes this to the next level by letting you create custom QR codes for all your crypto needs. Think of it as your personal wizard for zapping up QR codes that are as stylish as they are functional.

# How to Use a Bitcoin ATM Like a Pro

If you’ve never used a Bitcoin ATM before, fear not! It’s easier than ordering pizza online. Here’s your step-by-step guide:

# 1. Locate a BTM

First, find a Bitcoin ATM near you. A quick online search will point you to the nearest machine. Bonus points if it’s in a cool coffee shop.

# 2. Get Your Wallet Ready

Before you head out, make sure your crypto wallet is locked and loaded. If you’re using our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App**, generate a QR code linked to your wallet for a seamless experience.

# 3. Choose Your Adventure

At the ATM, select whether you want to buy or sell Bitcoin. Each machine will guide you through the process with on-screen instructions.

# 4. Scan Your QR Code

This is the fun part! Hold your QR code up to the machine’s scanner. Within seconds, it reads your wallet address like a boss.

# 5. Complete the Transaction

Insert cash or confirm your Bitcoin transfer. The machine does its thing, and voila—you’ve joined the crypto elite.

# 6. Celebrate Your Crypto Savvy

Feel free to do a little victory dance. You’ve earned it.

# Why You Need the Bitcoin QR Code Maker App in Your Life

Now that you’re a certified BTM pro, let’s talk about why our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** is the ultimate sidekick. It’s not just an app; it’s a game-changer. Here’s why:

1. **Customizable Codes**: Create QR codes that reflect your style. Add colors, logos, or even cheeky messages. (Why not?)
2. **Multi-Currency Support**: Not just for Bitcoin! Generate QR codes for Ethereum, Litecoin, and more.
3. **Fast and Free**: Speedy code generation with no hidden fees. What’s not to love?
4. **Secure and Reliable**: Built with top-notch security to keep your crypto safe.

Using our app is like having a personal assistant who never sleeps and always delivers. It’s the secret weapon every crypto enthusiast needs.

# Real-Life Scenarios Where BTMs and QR Codes Shine

# Traveling the World

Imagine you’re backpacking through Europe. You stumble upon a Bitcoin ATM in a cozy café in Berlin. With your QR code ready, you buy some Bitcoin to cover your hostel stay. Efficient, right?

# Emergency Cash

It’s 2 a.m., and you need cash. The nearest bank ATM is miles away, but a BTM is just around the corner. Your QR code saves the day, and you’re back to your midnight snack in no time.

# Supporting a Cause

You’re at a charity event, and they’re accepting crypto donations. Whip out your custom QR code, and boom—you’ve contributed to something meaningful in seconds.

# The Future of Bitcoin ATMs and QR Codes

The Bitcoin ATM market is growing faster than you can say “blockchain.” Here’s what’s on the horizon:

1. **Wider Adoption**: As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect BTMs to pop up in more locations—airports, malls, maybe even your local gym.
2. **Enhanced Features**: Think facial recognition, voice commands, and multilingual support. The future is fancy.
3. **Seamless Integration**: Apps like our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** will play an even bigger role in making transactions smoother than ever.

# Final Thoughts: A Match Made in Crypto Heaven

Bitcoin ATMs and QR codes are the dynamic duo the crypto world never knew it needed. Together, they’re making cryptocurrency accessible, convenient, and downright fun. Whether you’re a seasoned hodler or a curious newbie, our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** ([https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)) is your ultimate ally in navigating this brave new world.

So, next time you spot a Bitcoin ATM, don’t just walk by. Step up, scan your QR code, and dive into the future of finance with a smile. Because with Bitcoin and QR codes, the possibilities are endless, and the journey is just getting started.",1,1737250475.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False

1i4mth9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1i4mth9/hes_coming_around_rant/,he’s coming around - rant.,"My DA ex randomly ended things with me after “suddenly losing feelings and not knowing why” after three months of dating. We met at a bar he worked at the food truck in right by my coffee shop and he did the classic lovebomb and discard. ive been shattered.

he begged me to be friends, cried in my arms post breakup, told me he’d wait for me (to be friends) and then when i reached out because he was reaching out to my friends and coming around, seeming sad, he completely ghosted me. i tried reaching out a few times over the course of a month and after no responses and many panic attacks, i reached out and told him never to speak to me or come near me again.

last night i went on an incredible date. slow-burn kind of date where he didnt try pushing my boundaries or being physical, actually asked me questions about myself, and made sure i got home at a respectable time. he asked me to go on a second date and asked me if it was okay to hug me goodbye. i cried in my car because i realized i havent had a first date where i felt so respected and actually like someone wanted to get to know me, genuinely. there was no rushing, no lovebombing, no trauma dumping. it was a breath of fresh air.

then i found out today that my ex came into the bat that we met at yesterday (which is RIGHT next to my work) and he knows that i go there often and have a lot of friends there. he KNOWS i close at 5:30 on fridays and sometimes go in after. and guess what time he went in? 5:30. took in some friends and then seemed frustrated and rushed out. 
they think its because they charged him for a drink.

im so frustrated that he never responded and continues to go to places that i go? he doesnt even live in my city. my boundaries feel disrespected and while im still having panic attacks over him, he is going into places where he knows he might see me. i know its not for me and he doesnt care about me, but he genuinely doesnt care about the impact that would have on me and about ghosting me after begging for me to be in his life. he said that hed never go there again after he quit and i feel like my safe spaces are becoming unsafe.

i just want to heal and move on. i miss him but i never want to see him again.

Hey there! 😊

I’m a 28-year-old from Europe, and I’m here looking for a connection that feels authentic—something built on shared understanding, good conversations, and maybe even a little magic. Whether we start with a friendly chat or dive into the bigger questions of life, I’m open to seeing where the journey takes us.

# A Bit About Me

* **Who I Am:** I’m a writer at heart—someone who’s fascinated by the world’s little details and always looking to capture its fleeting moments in words. I believe there’s poetry in everyday life if you look close enough. I’d describe myself as curious, introspective, and quietly optimistic.
* **My Interests:**
   * **Music:** I’m on a journey to become a vinyl collector (once I have the space for it!). I love crafting playlists that feel like soundtracks to moments in life, and I’m always hunting for new tracks that speak to the soul.
   * **Nature and Exploration:** Whether it’s hiking to catch a golden-hour view, wandering unfamiliar streets, or just stargazing on a clear night, I’m happiest when I’m exploring.
   * **Creativity:** I’ve been dabbling in photography lately, trying to turn fleeting scenes into lasting memories. Writing has always been my first love, but this new creative outlet is giving it some competition.
   * **Gaming and Relaxing:** On quieter days, I enjoy diving into a good game or settling in for a movie marathon—it’s all about balance, right?

# What I’m Looking For

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s as curious about life as I am. Here’s what I’d love in a partner:

* **Kindness:** You lead with your heart and care about the people around you. You’re the kind of person who finds joy in small gestures and values connection over pretense.
* **Curiosity:** You see the world as a big, wonderful puzzle to explore—whether that’s through travel, learning something new, or simply seeing the beauty in the everyday.
* **Openness:** Life is full of surprises, and you’re not afraid to embrace them. You’re willing to share your dreams, your quirks, and maybe even your favorite coffee order.
* **Partnership:** Someone who wants to build something together—a shared world full of laughter, quiet moments, and spontaneous adventures.

# Why Message Me?

I’d like to think I bring a unique mix of thoughtfulness and enthusiasm to the table. I’ll remember the little things about you—the way your favorite song makes you smile, the dreams you’re too shy to share, or the stories that light up your eyes. I’m loyal, steady, and the kind of person who shows up for the big moments and the small ones.

I believe in the magic of connection. Whether it’s through a shared playlist, a midnight chat, or a day spent exploring something new, I want to create moments that matter—moments that turn into memories we’ll always carry.

# Let’s Start a Story

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let’s talk about music, share our favorite books, or dream up an imaginary trip to the most beautiful place we can think of. Or maybe we’ll just start with “hello” and see where the conversation takes us.

Every story starts with a single step—this could be ours. Looking forward to hearing from you. 😊",1,1737249769.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1i4mmtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderfluid/comments/1i4mmtf/chest_dysphoria_concerns_and_communication_issues/,"Chest Dysphoria, Concerns, and Communication Issues AFAB","I should probably start by saying I identify as genderfluid, it fits how I feel. However, I think I have a fairly clear idea of what I want with my body but struggle with achieving it and feel intense dysmorphia at times.

I want to be flat chested, and I've been having difficulty achieving that. In addition, I'm on the spectrum and have difficulty with clear and effective communication with other people. It's always been a struggle for me, and this is something that's extremely personal. I'm worried I'm not able to discuss this with someone (like a doctor) who might have better insight, or I effectively communicate and they're not able to help, OR they only provide something that isn't what I want. I've always had to live with it but sometimes it makes me extremely upset inside. I've been doing upper body workouts and cardio, they're smaller than they've ever been before but it still isn't enough. I've started lifting heavier weights and have felt soreness in my chest muscle from exercise (this is still early on so it's hard to tell if it's going to do anything.) I read that lifting doesn't actually shrink breast size but gives the appearance of smaller breasts. This was something my partner suggested, and it's something I want to do because the other option is making me nervous because it's extreme and I'm unsure of what the outcome might be.

 

If exercise doesn't work, having a surgical option is something my partner isn't exactly supportive about. If this doesn't work, I'd be worried about having scars, which I think is the biggest/scariest negative for me. I think of things like what if it doesn't look natural and have to live with something that doesn't look or feel like me either. My partner is the only person I've ever been able to communicate any of this to and it's still difficult because the conversation can sometimes be an emotional and sensitive topic. It's not something I talk about often because it's exhausting, the conversation tends to spiral, and it's usually out of context with anything else going on in my life. So, I keep it to myself, but somethings it just…bubbles up. Sometimes I go through waves of emotion where I feel so uncomfortable and resentful in my own body. I never thought what I wanted was that much to ask for. Throughout the years I've worked very hard on my body with diet, cardio, and strength training. I feel healthier and better than I ever had in my life, and I'm proud of the work I've accomplished with myself.

 

I'd like to add I sometimes have pain and lumps in both my breasts around that time of the month and had ultrasounds on them because the pain was so bad it felt like I had rug burn inside my chest. The pain, swelling, and sensitivity magnifies my irritation with having them in the first place. (Random, but I've found that breaking open two capsules of vitamin E and applying to where I feel lumps/cysts topically seems to reduce the swelling/pain of the cysts, although it's sticky and messy.) The doctors told me there's no sign of cancer, but my breasts are extremely dense. As for the cysts, they told me there's nothing they can do. The only help they gave me is no caffeine, no sugar, no alcohol, and no salt. Which I have seriously cut down on everything, and don't drink coffee or soda.

 

This is something I've never openly discussed before. But I genuinely want to know what your thoughts are. I think sometimes I'm too much in my head, but I can't deny that I feel some real emotional discomfort about my body. Is this something I just need to ""get over it""? Can I become flat chested with exercise, or will I have to go through surgery? If I have to go down that route, how do I effectively communicate what I want? How do I keep myself in the right headspace for something that feels very sensitive and personal? Does anyone else feel this way or similar and what were your experiences? Am I overthinking everything? (I'm sorry this ended up so long, thank you for taking the time to read this.)",2,1737249450.0,genderfluid,1,1.0,False

1. Thank GOD for accommodations. I have diagnosed OCD and Anxiety so I asked for the start/pause and removing the experimental option. I didn’t ask for extra time as the start/pause option was more than enough to help me with my conditions. I only say this because in my older post, I recommended the importance of simulating test-day conditions. I say this mainly because of my coffee consumption. I require caffeine but I have to consume it an hour before my exam so that provided it doesn’t sit well with my stomach, I can use the bathroom way before the exam. All the other times I completed this routine before my actual test day, I. Was. Fine. HOWEVER, on my actual test day, the coffee I got today decided it was going to act up. Therefore, I thank GOD for this accommodation and I didn’t have to sit there with an upset stomach and was able to use the bathroom a few times during my sections. 

2. I was one of those test-taking students that had an issue with Prometric. I was supposed to take my exam on Thursday but I had issues with Prometric and could not access my exam for some reason. CALL LSAC RIGHT AWAY. Nevermind sending an email. CALL THEM. Also, DONT WAIT. I was able to be rescheduled for today following my call. I’ve seen from other peoples post that they never got a reschedule date and have to postpone it to February. This can be worry some for students who are depending on their January LSAT score for admission to September. 

3. While many students had difficult and unhelpful proctors, I somehow got lucky with all 6 different proctors. In one instance, I kept looking behind me during my 2 min break in between section 1 and 2. My proctor asked why I kept looking back during my break and I said, “I am starting to get a headache and I’m wondering if I have enough time to find a Tylenol in my room” and he/she said “Wait until the section starts and I will pause it for you. As long as you’re in the frame, you can go look, we will just have to do another security check”. This was comforting because the first time I had to take the exam, my proctor threatened to cancel my test for tapping my pencil on my desk. 

4. The overall exam was so kind to me. I didn’t experience any difficult sections (the questions either went over my head or I studied hard enough that I was able to approach the questions easily). I did get one PowerScore Crystal Ball prediction in the RC section so I am grateful for that. 



I am just elated that I no longer have to deal with the LSAT but also somewhat feeling a sense of emptiness???? Like what am I supposed to do now. See you all February 5! ",2,1737249107.0,LSAT,0,1.0,False

-----------------------------------------------------

In today's world, where space is often at a premium, making the most of your home aesthetics matters more than ever, especially in areas like the kitchen. One innovative solution that has recently gained popularity is the rolling kitchen. This versatile and stylish addition not only optimizes space but also elevates the overall aesthetics of your home.

A rolling kitchen can take many forms. It typically includes a mobile cart or island with wheels, allowing you to move it around your kitchen or dining area with ease. This flexibility not only maximizes your space but also enables you to adapt your kitchen layout to suit various occasions, whether it's a family gathering or an intimate dinner.

### Benefits of a Rolling Kitchen

- **Space Optimization:** A rolling kitchen is perfect for smaller homes or apartments. You can easily tuck it away when not in use, freeing up valuable floor space.
- **Customization:** Many rolling kitchens come in different styles, colors, and materials, allowing you to choose one that complements your existing décor. This adds a personalized touch to your kitchen aesthetics.
- **Versatility:** Use it for preparation, serving, or even as a bar cart. The possibilities are endless, making it a multifunctional addition to your home.
- **Easy Mobility:** Its wheels make it simple to move around for cleaning or rearranging your kitchen setup without heavy lifting.

When considering how to enhance your home aesthetics with a rolling kitchen, it’s essential to select the right design that complements your overall style. Here are some ideas to get you started:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-aesthetics-rolling-kitchen  
  
### Selecting the Right Style

Choose a rolling kitchen that aligns with your home decor. This can serve as a key piece that ties the room together. Some popular styles include:

- **Modern:** Look for clean lines and sleek surfaces in materials such as stainless steel or glass. A modern rolling kitchen can elevate the contemporary vibe of your home.
- **Rustic:** Wooden carts with distressed finishes can bring warmth and character to your space. This style blends beautifully with farmhouse or country-style homes.
- **Industrial:** Opt for carts with metal frames and wooden tops to create a trendy industrial look. They can be a perfect fit for urban apartments.

Additionally, think about the color scheme. Neutral colors provide a classic look, while bold hues can create a statement piece in your kitchen. Remember to choose a rolling kitchen that fits your daily needs and preferences.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-aesthetics-rolling-kitchen  
  
### Functional Features to Consider

As you explore options for a rolling kitchen, pay attention to practical features that will enhance usability:

- **Storage Capacity:** Look for a cart with shelves, drawers, or cabinets to keep your kitchen utensils organized and easily accessible.
- **Work Surface:** A rolling kitchen can serve as a prep station, so consider models with sturdy, spacious countertops.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure it can accommodate appliances like toasters, mixers, or blenders if you plan to use it for food preparation.

When you add a rolling kitchen to your home, think about how to incorporate decorations and functional items that reflect your style. For instance, placing attractive jars of spices, a chic coffee maker, or a display of cookbooks can make the piece more than just functional—it turns it into an eye-catching centerpiece.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-aesthetics-rolling-kitchen  
  
### Creating a Cohesive Look

Integrating your rolling kitchen with other elements in your home enhances the overall aesthetics. Here are some tips:

- **Complementary Accessories:** Use kitchen towels, dishware, or decorative plants that match or accentuate your rolling kitchen’s color palette.
- **Lighting:** Well-placed pendant lights or under-cabinet LED lights can create a warm atmosphere, highlighting your new addition.
- **Flooring:** If your rolling kitchen has a wooden design, consider coordinating the flooring to create harmony in your kitchen space.

Embracing the latest trend of a rolling kitchen not only enhances your home aesthetics but also increases functionality. With flexibility and style, it’s a smart investment that can transform cooking, dining, and entertaining into a delightful experience. Take the time to choose the right rolling kitchen for your home, and appreciate the enhanced beauty and practicality it brings.

Practical Benefits of Integrating a Rolling Kitchen into Home Design
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a beautiful home is not just about aesthetics; it’s also about functionality. One innovation that has been gaining popularity in home design is the rolling kitchen. This practical and stylish addition can transform not only your kitchen experience but your entire home environment. Let’s explore some of the practical benefits of integrating a rolling kitchen into your home design.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-aesthetics-rolling-kitchen  
  
### Space Efficiency

One of the main advantages of a rolling kitchen is its ability to save space. In many homes, especially those with smaller kitchens, every inch counts. A rolling kitchen provides a compact solution that can easily be moved as needed. When not in use, it can be tucked away, freeing up precious floor space. This flexibility allows you to maximize your kitchen's potential without making permanent architectural changes.

### Versatility and Adaptability

A rolling kitchen is not just a single-use object; it can serve multiple functions. Here are several ways a rolling kitchen can adapt to your needs:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-aesthetics-rolling-kitchen  
  
- **Cooking Station:** Use it as an additional prep area. It can hold utensils, spices, or even a cutting board.
- **Serving Cart:** When entertaining guests, roll it out for easy serving of food and drinks.
- **Storage Space:** It can also serve as a mobile pantry, offering extra storage for cookware and pantry items.

This adaptability makes a rolling kitchen a valuable asset, allowing you to customize your approach based on your lifestyle and kitchen activities.

### Style and Design

Integrating a rolling kitchen can also elevate your home aesthetics. These kitchens often come in various designs, colors, and materials to fit seamlessly into your existing decor. Consider a rustic wooden cart for a farmhouse look or a sleek metal design for a modern vibe. The right rolling kitchen can act as a statement piece that not only offers utility but also enhances the overall visual appeal of your space.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-aesthetics-rolling-kitchen  
  
### Easy Mobility

One significant benefit of having a rolling kitchen is its mobility. If you enjoy cooking but need to move around frequently, this feature will come in handy. You can roll it to any area you need—whether it’s close to your stove, sink, or serving area. This makes cooking more efficient and enjoyable. Plus, if you decide to rearrange your kitchen or host a gathering, the rolling kitchen can quickly adapt to your chosen layout.

### Organization Made Simple

Clutter can be a significant barrier to a pleasant cooking experience. A rolling kitchen helps maintain organization in your space. You can designate sections for various activities, like meal prep, cooking, or baking, keeping everything within arm's reach. By having all your essentials in one mobile area, you can streamline your cooking process and reduce the stress often associated with meal preparation.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-aesthetics-rolling-kitchen  
  
### Cost-Effective Solution

Integrating a rolling kitchen is also a budget-friendly option. Instead of overhauling your entire kitchen with expensive renovations, investing in a rolling kitchen is a more economical and less invasive way to upgrade your home. It allows you to enhance functionality without breaking the bank, making it accessible for homeowners on a budget. Plus, you can always find rolling kitchens that offer good quality at various price points.

### Ideal for Small Spaces

For those living in apartments or smaller homes, a rolling kitchen can be a game-changer. It is often challenging to fit traditional kitchen furniture in compact spaces. A rolling kitchen can be elegantly integrated, providing essential surfaces and storage without overwhelming your area. Its streamlined nature means you can enjoy a functional kitchen even in tight quarters.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-aesthetics-rolling-kitchen  
  
### Eco-Friendly Option

Rolling kitchens can support an eco-friendly lifestyle. By allowing you to cook more efficiently with your ingredients organized and at your fingertips, you can reduce food waste. Additionally, many manufacturers are producing rolling kitchens with sustainable materials, allowing you to make environmentally conscious choices in your home design.

A rolling kitchen is more than just a convenient furniture piece; it’s a practical addition that can make your home more functional and visually appealing. By integrating one into your home design, you can enjoy a flexible, stylish, and efficient cooking space that enhances your lifestyle.

### Conclusion

Integrating a rolling kitchen into your home not only enhances aesthetics but also elevates functionality. This innovative design element allows you to create a versatile space that can adapt to your cooking and entertaining needs. You can effortlessly move it from room to room, providing the flexibility to host gatherings or simply enjoy cooking in different settings.

1i4ma06,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4ma06,"NYC Haul w/ notes descriptions & descriptions, store experiences and updated collection photos. **long post**","To start my new year right, I traveled to NYC to explore various fragrance shops that I’d been dying to check out and can safely report they did not disappoint.  I walked away from Manhattan with 15 full bottles, 11 travel size (10ml) and arrived home to 3 full bottles on my doorstep.  I’ve tried to workout how I should break down my haul and hope this helps with notes and a short description.   

Let me first start with the in-person experiences I had in a few of the stores. **Feel free to skip this section if you care to.**

I had heard stories that Scent Bar can be a bit chaotic and overwhelming but I didn’t find that at all.  I arrived for my first visit on a Sunday in the late afternoon and waited outside in line for approx. 15 mins. When I entered the store I was warmly greeted by Rose who promptly asked what I was looking for.  I explained to her that I leaned heavily to amber and gourmand fragrances but I was a collector and trying to stretch myself into more spring/summer scents but I was open to adding anything I felt worthy to my assortment.  Though the signs state a 20 min limit, I was there for over an hour (I believe) and walked away with seven full bottles.  Note they don’t give samples on the weekend but Rose snuck me a few pre-made ones to which I am grateful!

Rose had suggested I check out Stéle, a shop newly opened on Mott Street.  When I arrived I was stunned by the number of perfume brands I didn’t recognize! Wa:it Hito, The Ratontuer, Ormaie mixed in with familiar houses like Andrea Maack, Stora Skuggen and Liis made me feel right at home.  Jake (I believe one of the owners) approached me in a casual but friendly way, assessing what sort of mission I was on.  After a quick chat I could tell he was excited to show me a few makers he thought I would like… to which he was right. I walked out after 35 minutes with four full bottle! (I realized after I left that I had ordered a bottle of Luna by Kintsugi from their online shop which is currently on backorder but I’m eagerly awaiting.)

I don’t want to say I avoid designer perfumes but I do find myself… avoiding designer perfumes.  The one major exception I make in Guerlain, I find their perfumes to be elegant, well blended and beautiful. When I walked into Saks 5th Ave I bee-lined it to their counter (no pun intended) expecting no greeting (I’m a heavily tattooed elder goth) but was surprised when Yahaira promptly asked what sort of scents I liked.  She was warm, charming and her Queen’s accent was so endearing I could have shopped all day with her.   I left with 1 full bottle (personalized), the eight 10ml discovery set and of course an iconic red lipstick in the personalized lipstick case… as they say… when in Rome.  

Finally, I returned back to Scent Bar the next day, only to do some browsing… there was no wait and immediately Marcelle blew my cover and recognized me from the day before.  Madison (gosh I hope that was her name, she was lovely and a fellow Capricorn) was fast to pull bottles I hadn’t tried, was fun to chat with, and gave great recommendations.  Lance was wonderful also and had the same shoes on as me, so of course we were fast friends.  They made me samples, let me stay a little after closing and I walked away with 3 more full bottles.

All-in-all I went to many other places and plan to visit NYC again to add to my collection… now onto the show.

I’ve divide these by the following categories - 

Deep and Dark (fall/winter)
Sweet and Edible (summer/fall)
Squeaky Clean (spring/summer/year-round)
Soft and Floral  (spring/summer)

*Deep and Dark*

Romance Noire by Sylhouette -  I would describe this scent in two words “love lost”.  This immediately takes me to laying in agony from heartache on a leather couch, empty bottles of wine, ashtray full of half smoked cigarettes and a vase of wilted roses that should have been tossed weeks ago. This was the first perfume I had smelled from Sylhouette but I could sense the perfumer's portrayal of darkness and melancholy without a doubt. This one feels almost like you are spying on someone’s memory and it’s heartbreaking but outstanding.

Notes: Wild Berries, Aged Wine, Dried Rose, Dusty Leather, Dark Smoke

Bible Noire by Sylhouette - They describe this scent as “losing faith” and does bring imagery of a charred bible or church pew.  The opening is ash and smoke followed by biblical oils, resins and an animalic finish (note: they use real Castoreum, so with this what you will).  Though unorthodox still very wearable and beautiful.  Looking back I wish I had purchased several others in the collection: Desir Noir, Soleil Noir… Chanson Noire - all interesting.

Notes: Olibanum Absolute, Myrrh, Guaiacwood, Labdanum Absolute, Choya Loban Absolute, Castoreum, Himalayan Cedarwood

Private by Inverso  - A delicate dance of citrus from the bergamot, rose and black oud blend in a way that makes each note stand on its own.  This scent is perfectly unisex and screams seduction.  This NYC based brand (they live down the street from Stéle) seems so intimate with their handwritten labels in gold ink and the black and white photographs that accompany each bottle. I found on their website you can customize your discovery set - to which I will be doing so ASAP.

Top: Bergamot, Saffron, Pink Pepper 

Heart: Black Oud, Rose, Patchouli, Cedarwood 

Base: Sandalwood, Amber, Vanilla, Musk 

Rock the Myrrh by Dries Von Noten - I really wish I didn’t love these bottles so much… the porcelain and color tinted glass beg to be added to my collection but at $340 USD a 10ml will have to do.  The loudest voices in this song are the suede and myrrh notes by far to me.  The spice and woodiness bring an earthiness that reads almost leather.  This is sophisticated and reeks of old money - to which I love.   

Top: Cypress, Pink Pepper

Heart: Myrrh, Patchouli

Base: Suede, Benzoin

Spell 125 by Papillon - Though I believe most people know of this fragrance, I feel compelled to describe for the few that do not.  In the Ancient Egyptian Book for the Dead, Spell 125 is used when weighing the decease’s heart against a feather, if the heart is lighter or equal to the heather the person is deemed pure.  This perfume encapsulates this ceremony in a way that feels illegal.  The heavy ancient oils of frankincense with the fresh pine combined with the ambergris (white being considered the most pure and softest)  create an earthy musk that some may find off-putting while others will see it as a masterpiece.  I’m not yet the women that would wear Spell 125 but my hope is I’ll be her soon enough. Very happy to add this to my assembly.

Notes: White Ambergris. Siberian Pine. Black Hemlock. Green Sacra Frankincense. Ylang. Indian Sandalwood. 

*Sweet and Edible*

Tobacco Honey by Guerlain - Does this need any introduction? Though this was released in 2023, you may think it’s been around for decades. The timeless combination of sweet and savory is so well combined, there is no distinguishing from a top, heart or base note. The sweet, animalic honey married with the dried tobacco carries a sophisticated  quality that Guerlain delivers so well. The vanilla, tonka and sandalwood add a depth that takes the honey from a traditional sticky sweet to an elegant elixir. Excellent longevity both on the skin and in sillage makes the hefty price of $395 USD for 100ml feel less scandalous. 

Notes: honey, cloves, anise, tobacco, tonka, vanilla, sesame, agarwood (oud) and sandalwood

Gioiosa by Profumum Roma - Meaning Joyful in Italian, the makers knew this one would bring a smile to the faces of those who discovered it.  On the softer side of the gourmand spectrum, I believe this would be highly appealing to the masses.  A creamy, somewhat lactonic, warm vanilla with the ever so subtle hint of citrus and floral.  The dry down stays sweet but not cloying and translated to a sophisticated spun sugar you would see on a fancy dessert.  I’m pleasured that the brand decided to offer an 18ml at ~$135 USD as the only other size is 100ml at $320 USD….which I do find rather steep in this case but happy to have more then a sample size. 

Notes: Amber, Bergamot, Coconut, Jasmin, Mosses, Orange, Vanilla

Bianco Latte by Giardini di Toscana - Ay ya yai… this one is known by anyone that has ever seen a TikTok perfume review in 2024 but while I’m here, I’ll give my two (s)cents.  Bianco Latte is exactly what you expect it to be, a strong honey vanilla that is simple with decent longevity.  This was one that was on my porch when I arrived home and frankly forgot I had ordered it.  The synthetic sweetness may be too much for some or even reminiscent to B&BW scents worn in our teens… but it’s simple, wearable and I only paid $70 instead of the $150 for 100ml.  If you are looking for a gourmand that everyone knows and most people enjoy this may be the one but I can think of 100 other perfumes that I’d pick before this one (apologize if this comes off as harsh).  You’ll likely find me wearing this around the house on chore days. 

Top: Caramel.

Heart: Honey, Coumarin.

Base: Vanilla, White Musks.

Panettone by Milano Fragranze - I love this perfume and had no idea I needed it in my collection.  The imagery of an Italian bread, enjoyed at Christmas is so spot on you’ll feel the need to grab a fork when sampling.  A dense fruitcake filled with rum soaked bitter orange, spiced ginger and a hint of carrot makes this scent irresistible.  Excited to have this in my summer gourmand arsenal but I’m sure I’ll wear it much sooner. 

Notes: Bitter Orange, Mandarin, Ginger, Carrot Seeds, Davana, Rum, Everlasting Flower Absolute, Tagete Seeds, Vanilla Absolute, Vinyl Gaiacol

Van Extasyx by Lorenzo Pazzaglia - Van Py Rhum is one of my all time favorite vanilla perfumes and Van Extasyx is her older more elegant sister.  Both scents have 7 vanillas, making it unmistakeable what you are smelling but Van Extasyx has a pure vanilla extract that changes the overall approach.  VPR has two different rums, adding a boozy quality that’s not present in Van Ex.  Think college versus grad school… both are a good time just at different parties.  With that said Sugar Kisses is the much younger sister in high school - highly recommend sampling the three to see what I mean. 

Top: Bourbon Vanilla, Madagascar Vanilla, Tahitian Vanilla, Mohea Vanilla

Heart: Vanille Island, White Flowers, Caramel

Base: Agarwood, Pure Vanilla Extrait, Tonka bean, Black Vanilla Pods

Orgasmo by Hilda Soliani - I’ve been told in three different perfume shops, in three different states by three total strangers that Hilde Soliani is crazy and that alone makes me want to try all of her perfumes.  A vivacious Italian woman, multifaceted in the arts (theatre, painting, jewelry design, perfumer) trends this amazingly creative line between traditional and modern scents.  From all of the perfumes I have sampled of hers, you get the sense that she draws inspiration from her cherished memories and her love of FOOD! This particular fragrance was inspired but her beach adventured with friends while sipping iced almond coffee.  Sweet cherry-like tones evoke the image of a marzipan dough ready to be rolled on a wood butcher block.  This is a showstopper for any almond scent lover. 

Notes: Almond, Amaretto Liqueur Accord

Sugarful Sweet Nothings by Michel Germain  - This fun little 100ml bottle is in the shape of a retro sugar shaker and is only $55 USD!!! The bright green apple and lavender elevate this from reading too much like Pink Sugar, and the caramel and tonka bean add warmth and interest.  This is a sweet, sundress in a bottle and surprised I’ve never seen a review or even a mention.  There are 7 scents in the Sugarful collection (Sugarful, Sweet Nothing, Kiss, Sunshine, Dream, Spice and for men) and at this price point would be a great entry into gourmands with little comittment.  

Top: Green Apple, Sugared Lemon, Bergamot 

Heart: Sweet Muguet, Pink Rose, Lavender

Base: Creamy Caramel, Powdery Tonka Bean, Musk 

*Squeaky Clean*

Ethereal Wave by Liis - In my last perfume haul I admitted that Liis is a house that goes against most of what I enjoy in perfume… yet here I am on my second full bottle.  In my quest to lean into other scent families I continue to find myself enjoying this house for its quiet, understated notes.  This tea scent is clean, fresh with a subtle spice of cardamom but the name had me assuming I was getting into aquatics - but the name is inspired by the ethereal music of The Cocteau Twins, a Scottish 80’s Rock band (which makes for a way better image then literal waves). Very easy spring/summer scent.

Notes: Bergamot, Cardamom White Tea, Black Tea Absolute, Blonde Woods, Velvet Musk

Nitesurf Neroli by Regime des Fleurs - Neroli? Smoked Seashells? Salt Mist?? These are nowhere close to my personal profile but I was drawn in instantly.  The salty brine, the bitterness of the neroli, sweetness of the florals and slight smoke make this beach accord far more interesting than loads of scents in this category.  This is what I wanted from Sex And The Sea Neroli by Francesca Bianch, a dreamy ocean blend that was more of a whisper than an incredibly loud shout (if you know Franny B, then you know) and happy when Madison at Scent Bar asked me to try it even though I resisted.  I plan to explore more of Regime des Fleurs soonest. 

Top: Neroli Water, Salty Mist

Heart:  Neon Petals, Ginger Lily, Transparent Citrus, Hedione

Base: Smoked Seashells, Ambroxan

The Ghost in the Shell by Stat Libre d’Orange - Named after the Manga series Etat describes their inspiration as “this fragrance embodies the concept of merging organic and technological aspects, reflecting themes from the ""Ghost in the Shell"" universe. It symbolizes the evolution of humanity enhanced by technology, aiming to create a scent that feels both familiar and futuristic.” I hate to say this… but… that feels like a stretch.  This perfume is a perfectly clean, fresh skin scent that carries a soapy quality.  I purchased this purely off the soft, slight pear/peach note I believed I smelled  and was terribly confused after locating the real notes. No idea what theses mean but all in all it’s a beautiful fragrance that I think people may pass up simply by not understanding what to expect from these notes.  I imagine wearing this straight from the shower on lazy days that I work from home.

Top: Aqual, Tuzu HE, hexyl acetate (MANE biotech)

Heart: Ijasmine absolute, mugane, milky skin accord

Base: Moss accord, vinyl gaiacol (MANE biotech), Orcanox

Epona by Papillon - This-is-a-masterpiece.  Though I am a city girl through and through this scent summons some equestrian rider I didn’t know I had in me.  Created as a tribute to Liz Moores’ horse and named after the Celtic goddess of horses this embodies the animal, the saddle, the rider and the grassy meadow.  Rarely has a perfume stopped me in my tracks and transported me in a way that this one has.  The leather and saddle soap combined with the horse skin note makes this so unique, I’ve smelled nothing like it and doubt I ever will.  Highly HIGHLY recommend you find a sample if you are an Equine enthusiast (or pretend to be ;)). 

Notes: warm horse skin, saddle soap, green meadows, leather saddle

*Soft and Floral*

Soie Malaquais by Dries Von Noten - short and sweet… yes… this is worth the hype.  The silk and chestnut could be characterized as alluring as this is subdued sweetness with hardly any floral - an interesting balance between pretty and sexy.  This is sold out all over the world currently (including Saks, Bergdorf, online… etc.) but suspect when it is available I’ll splurge on a full size (vs. my 10ml).

Top: Beramont, Blackcurrant 

Heart: Rose, Silk

Base: Chestnut, Cocoa 

Camomille Satin by Dries Von Noten - my third DVN I picked up while in NYC and I realize that each has a textile note: Suede, Silk and now this one with Satin.  Some may argue that this should liven the gourmand category but I highly disagree. This is a soft, tea floral with hints of vanilla for balance and musk for interest. This is by far the lightest of the three I brought home but this doesn’t take away from the loveliness.  I would love a full bottle but at this price tag, I would hope it was more of a punch to the face so it will be on the long list for a while longer. 

Top: Chamomile, Petit Grain Bigarade

Heart: Lavender Absolute , Orange Flower Absolute , Rose, Turkish Absolute

Base: Vanilla Bean , Musk , Galbanum

Incantesimo by Inverso - I love lavender and this is the most perfect lavender scent I have ever smelled.  With 4 different types married with other aromatics like rosemary and sage this fragrance is gorgeous.  The night I took this home I wore it to bed and could not stop smelling myself.  Call it a floral, call it an aromatic… whatever it is, the names translation of spell/enchantment is description enough for me. 

Top: White Lavender, Rosemary, Bergamot

Heart: Purple Lavender, Lavandula Angustifolia (or English Lavender), Lavandula Nana, Sage, Coriander, Geranium, Cypress, Rosemary

Base: Amber, Vanilla, Tonka Bean


Black Jade by Lubin  - I am a sucker for perfume history. Inspired by a scent reportedly worn by Marie Antoinette, this was recreated from a formula by her personal perfumer, Jean-Louis Fargeon. Floral, fresh, spicy, woody and blended in a way that each note doesn’t take away from the next.  I’ll admit the connection to its former owner was why I made the purchase but the scent on its own is beautiful and timeless and will enjoy flaunting it this spring.  

Top: galbanum, bergamot, cardamom

Middle: rose, jasmine, incense, cinnamon

Base: sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, tonka bean, amber

So after hours of searching I’m down to 4 grinders for an upgrade : the Eureka Mignon Specialita, MiiCoffee DF54, Baratza sette 270 and Mazzer Luigi Super Jolly. 
I’m on a budget (180€) so I’m looking for second hand grinders but while the Eureka would be my first choice, it’s impossible to find in acceptable conditions for less than 300€. The Baratza is really hard to find, and the DF54 is almost inexistant in France, where I live. 
This brings me to the Mazzer, which is surprisingly easy to find, for interesting prices here, I actually just stumbled upon a Mazzer « Major » for 90€. Is this a good choice? I also found a Super Jolly for 180€. Why are there so many to sell for such cheap prices whereas the Eureka is almost twice as expensive? Is this only because it is big? I’m adding the picture of the 90€ one, as the person who is selling it said to me she does not know much about it, only that it came with the restaurant she bought and that she would not need it now. Why is there this big chunk of steel in front? Sorry for the long post, I’m kind of lost.

1i4m2et,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i4m2et/need_advice/,need advice,"i think i just left my husband for good.  i don't know, im still shaking nervous and scared he'll find me.  we got in a huge fight to where he pinned me onto the floor and threw a mug and a cup at me.  our daughter saw the whole thing.  when i was on the floor she started crying and run up to her dad and starting hitting him, after he got off me i picked her up and put her in her room.  he kept throwing things at me and yelling at me telling me how useless i am as a SAHM.  i was crying screaming and begging him to leave the house (i am the only person on the lease but he does send me money for rent and has a key).  he eventually left and i packed a bag for me in my daughter and now we are at a hotel.  i left the mess (water and coffee and shampoo and whatever else he threw at me) and my cats behind...i dont know what to do.  i wanted to call the cops but i've been down the road and it got really messy.  i had a PFA before and my husband (daughters dad) had supervised visitation but refused to see her bc it was supervised.  he also did not pay child support.  thankfully at this time we were both working so my money was really tight but i made it work.  now, i am a SAHM making about $4k in disability.  would i even get child support?  i home school our daughter (i guess you can call it that?  she's 3 and will start a part time daycare this summer to prep for kindergarten) he hits our kid after i told him multiple
times that's not how i want to raise our daughter.  he'll hit her for counting wrong, not doing what he asked immediately, not listening, i mean anything she does wrong and he's slapping her across the face.  is a PFA my only hope?  i dont want him to have unsupervised time with her bc im scared he would hurt her to get back at me for leaving.  i've tried divorcing him before but he made it difficult and now recently he's told me he would never give me the satisfaction of divorce.  i was trying to stay as long as i could to pay off CC debt and my car but i don't think i can take it anymore.  what do i do?  where do i go?  i cant stay in a hotel forever because now my cats are home with him (if he goes back home) and he also abuses them.  (he spins them around on the floor to make them dizzy to chases him around and catches them to hit them).  im not perfect, i've hit him back in self defense and now im scared that kinda screwed me over.  i dont think i'll have money for a lawyer because i know he would just drag this out.  

any advise helps...im so lost right now and i don't have family to go to",3,1737247735.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

I lost 6kilos in 2 months while tapering. I usually love my sweets and coffee but even coffee doesn’t taste the same.  
If i force myself to eat i just throw up. 
Does anyone else have this problem while tapering? ",2,1737247632.0,Effexor,1,1.0,False

I’ve heard good things about Topeca and some other brands. I kinda like medium to darker roasts and I believe the machine will handle these roasts better anyway.

We’d probably have 3-4 cups of coffee in total a day between my wife and I.

Any thoughts or suggestions on finding a good and semi affordable coffee?

1i4lz8z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4lz8z,I FINALLY DID IT!,"After many different trials, spread over quite a bit of time (I work 2 jobs, one being at a coffee shop so I don't really have the time nor the need to make espresso at home very often), I was finally able to get a recipe that worked for me. Don't mind the cup, I don't have any good latte cups now so I just used what I have. I'm more worried about getting it to taste good than I am getting it to look pretty, plus I had already tasted it before taking the pic.

I am very much a beginner and I have a very entry level machine (frossvt) with a pressurized basket and a Baratza ESP grinder. My shots kept coming out very sour even after I narrowed it down to the ideal grind size and couldn't figure it out, turns out I wasn't pulling the shots for long enough. I put 16g in and got about 38.5g out and it was perfect! Well, still not as good as the coffee shop I work at but I think it's as good as I'm gonna get with this machine and/or these beans. Also, I didn't have this scale until my wife got it for me for Christmas (I'm just now getting a chance to use it) and the scale I had before was way too big to fit under the machine so I had to do a lot of guesswork. Not ideal at all.

In the future I would like to upgrade to a Bambino Plus and get some non-pressurized baskets so I can really get it dialed in just right and I will also get a chance to experiment with some beans.

Also, for anyone wondering how I work at a coffee shop but don't know how to dial in espresso, it's because I work at Caribou Coffee and our espresso machines are super automatics and do everything for me. It's convenient but not helpful at all when it comes to learning how espresso works. I do have milk steaming down pretty well though.",9,1737247472.0,espresso,2,0.77,False

Insane!

This will definitely become a regular thing for me to detox.
