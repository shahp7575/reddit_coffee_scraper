1q64a84,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1q64a84/loss_of_motivation/,Loss of motivation,"Hey good fellows of reddit

As the title says, I’ve lost motivation. It started three months ago when I was studying in another city. I began to fall asleep during lectures, and got to a point where coffee wouldn’t keep me up. I was behind on a lot of material and I barely fit in with the other students. I got burnt out and decided to stop the studies and move back home. The university I went to was my dream university and I worked so hard to get in, so I was disappointed and dissatisfied over myself. But I couldn’t bring myself to continue. I got exhausted from all that, and needed a break from school.

I got back home two months ago, and I relaxed for 2-3 weeks, and decided to go back to my hobbies and work towards driver’s license. That lastet for a little while until I got into a fight with my father, which put me back down again. We talked it out, and things got better again. Motivation was building again and I was ready to start working. My sister works at a cinema, and helped me get a job there. I got my schedule and setup in the system, but then my sister decided she didn’t want to work with me after all, and that she felt she got pressured by out parents. That knocked me down again seeing as it was one of my only points of motivation at that point.

I also found out my father had downloaded dating apps, despite being married to my mother, which made me very conflicted and confused, and it took a toll on me. Ended up smashing my guitar into the wall in the buildup of infuriation and basically anger from the last two months (guitar is fine, wall not so much). I managed to clear it up with my parents, but it all still stings.

And now, I almost feel repulsed just thinking about playing the guitar. Even just listening to music feels more burdening. I’ve lost my love for music. I also used to be an avid gamer, but gaming feels more draining than giving. Reading also feels just taxing and my sleepschedule is just barely hanging on. All I do now is just lay in bed and watch stuff on my tablet. Everything just feels so draining, and I wish I had the motivation to at least do the things I enjoy now that I got the time to do so. And I don’t want to feel like this. What can I do?

I’m genuinely trying to check myself here and figure out if I’m overreacting or if my feelings are reasonable.

I (37F) have been dating a man (late 30s M) for a couple of months. Overall, the relationship has been warm, consistent, and affectionate. We talk often, spend a lot of time together, and until now I felt emotionally safe with him.

Here’s where things shifted.

Over time, he’s made several comments that felt judgmental or labeling, especially around my background and upbringing. For example:

	•	When I mentioned drinking coffee as a kid (which is very normal in my culture), he said, “That’s sad to give a kid caffeine.”

	•	He’s made joking comments about where I’m from or how I was raised that felt dismissive.

	•	He’s also labeled me as “corny,” “submissive,” or implied I’m overly agreeable.

Individually, these comments might seem small, but together they started to sting. So I calmly brought it up and said something along the lines of:

“I don’t think you’re trying to hurt me, but when you describe parts of my upbringing as ‘sad,’ it feels judgmental and hurts my feelings. I’m just asking for awareness of how your words land with me.” I honestly felt insulted. 

I was not asking him to change his beliefs, censor himself completely, or apologize endlessly. Just mindfulness.

His response really surprised me.

Instead of engaging with the specific concern, he shifted the conversation into religion and said things like:

	•	“You’re worried about being judged, so I’m worried about our spiritual compatibility because only God can judge me.”

	•	That people who feel judged by others need to examine their spirit and walk with God. 

	•	That this made him question whether we were “equally yoked.”

That felt like a huge leap to me, to go from “this comment hurt my feelings” to questioning my spirituality or emotional maturity. I tried to clarify that I wasn’t questioning our compatibility or his faith, and that I didn’t need theological framing, I just wanted to know if he could be mindful of how his words affect me. He did apologize, but continued to frame it as people being too sensitive or not fully connected to God. 

Now I feel shocked more than sadness. Am I overreacting for feeling hurt and unsettled by this?",1,1767755936.0,AIO,2,1.0,False

1q64374,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestMyApp/comments/1q64374/hi_im_looking_for_testers_for_my_app/,Hi! I'm looking for testers for my app,"***Hi everyone!***

I've been working on a social app called TWIBS that helps people get together with friends. I would love some testers to provide honest feedback and constructive criticism.

The basic idea is to make it easier to let your friends know about casual hangs, e.g. “Anyone want to do the Elysian Park trail on Sunday morning?” by dropping on a pin on the map, without having to spam group chats and text everyone you know. You can type that exact query into the AI Chat, and it will automatically look up the address for the trail and select the best 3D icon for the activity (in this case, a hiking signpost). 

You can also post a flyer or paste a link to an event, and the data will be automatically fetched from the image or URL so you can easily see which friends are going to upcoming shows near you.

Part of the motivation for creating an app like this was to make it easier for people to connect IRL. Life in post-Covid world can be very isolating, and my hope is that an app like this can make it fun to plan stuff and generally lower the bar for getting together in-person. I’ve found it especially useful for automatically pinging friends who frequent the same gyms/coffee shops by having them add those spots to their favorites so that we can easily let each other know when we go to those places. We’ve  also been using it as a quick and simple alternative to Partiful for things like small group dinners.

I'm looking for any kind of feedback, but especially curious about what specific use cases come to mind for you as a tester. Is this an app you would actually use? Why or why not? What can we do to make it better? 

TWIBS is completely free to use, but I’m including an invite code so that I can keep track of how people found it. Totally optional, but if you wouldn't mind, please use code ***TESTMYAPP*** during sign up.

Thank you! :)

I got the bottom drain with the table and all the accessories in since I haven’t run my electrical circuit yet my first brew was a cold brew coffee.  The process was so convenient using the bottom drain and the elevation of the table. And cleaning it in place inside my house without even having to go outside, was really nice.

I was planning to keep my old direct fire pot and strainer because I do low country boils in it.  But I’ve been wondering could I do a Lowcountry boil in the spike solo as well?  I mean, of course I know it will boil water, but I’m curious about the basket having very minimal holes in it.  Like, will it boil properly without the water being able to move in and out of the basket well?  In my mind, I’m envisioning the broth boiling under and all around the basket, bubbling, and splashing everywhere.

Thoughts?

1q63yvc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q63yvc,A nice tower,"I recently played SimTower again. Thanks to a lot of the good advice in this forum and elsewhere, I was able to make a SimTower tower that lives up to almost all of my childhood ambitions. It doesn't have the largest population or take up the most space or make the most profit, but it's symmetrical, is architecturally beautiful in an ""Empire State Building"" sort of way, and enables the happiest lives for the largest and most varied number of its residents without sacrificing anyone:

1. **Size**: its weekday population is about 19,200. Its weekend population is about 23,500.
2. **Rating**: the tower is often all blue, with all units simultaneously having the lovely blue ""excellent"" rating.
3. **Pricing**: the pricing is all the default ""average."" No lowering rents to boost ratings.
4. **Elevator placement**: all 24 elevators and 64 escalators are used. None are duplicative. Only one is ornamental.
5. **Elevator use**: people hardly ever get ""red"" waiting for an elevator. (After the Party Halls let out on floor 75 is the only occasional, regrettable exception.)
6. **Elevator use (more)**: the elevators all stop running by 1:00 a.m. or so, allowing a blissful few hours of quiet.
7. **Elevator cars**: all elevators have the ""Waiting Car Response"" option set to ""1"", so they all rush to wherever they're needed.
8. **Floor consistency**: all non-commercial floors have just one type of tenant: office, condominium, parking, etc.
9. **Section consistency**: all 15-story blocks of floors are devoted to just one type of non-commercial tenant:
   1. Basement: parking and commercial
   2. Floors 1-14: hotel suites
   3. Floors 15-29: double hotel rooms
   4. Floors 30-44: condominiums
   5. Floors 45-59: offices
   6. Floors 60-74: offices
   7. Floors 75-89: offices
   8. Floors 90+: condominiums
10. **Commercial placement**: commercial floors are clustered around lobbies, sky lobbies, and the basement.
11. **Commercial placement (more)**: shopping/dining is optimized for each block's local population:
   1. The floors immediately next to each lobby/skylobby are tailored for the residents of the 15-floor block above it, since apparently residents shop locally after at most one elevator ride and one stair/escalator trip, and the elevator ride must be down (not up).
      1. Condominiums get a mixture of retail, fast food, and restaurants.
      2. Offices prioritize fast food.
      3. Hotels prioritize restaurants.
   2. The first 128 shopping/dining establishments are on the floors directly above and below the lobbies, so the residents patronize the places in their block. (To learn more, see the 128 visitation limit links below.)
   3. ""Leftover"" establishments below the 128-visitation limit are clustered around floor 90, so the ""penthouse"" condominium residents have their choice of the finest shopping and dining.
12. **Medical center placement**: each block of offices or condominiums has its own pair of medical centers so no one has to travel far.
13. **Security placement**: each block has its own central security office.
14. **No empty space**: there's no empty floor space or padding.
15. **Escalator/elevator spacing**: no tenant complains they're far away from an elevator or escalator.
16. **Noise**: no tenant has noise complaints.
17. **Hotel suite excellence**: the finicky and demanding customers in the hotel suites almost always give a consistent blue ""excellent"" rating.
   1. They were never uniformly happy when they had to take express elevators, no matter how fast they moved. So now they're all below floor 15 and get direct elevator service to parking.
18. **Recycling center optimization**: the number of recycling centers is well-matched to the peak population (2,500 people served per center, 10 centers, and a peak population of \~23,500). There's never a ""Recycling Centers are full!"" notice.
19. **Parking**: the number of parking spots is well-matched to the usage from the hotel suites and offices (256 hotel suites, 256 office spaces, 304 parking spaces). There's never an ""Office workers demand Parking"" notice.
20. **Housekeeping**: housekeeping services almost always get done between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m., giving the housekeepers a few hours' well-earned rest.
21. **Starting money**: the tower started with the $2,000,000 opening, not the $4,000,000 opening.

And I'm also happy about some stylistic and artistic choices that let me imagine the residents having happy lives:

1. The tower has the classic art deco Empire State Building/Chrysler Tower shape: broad at the base and soaring to a spire.
2. The lobby is the magnificent 3-story lobby version.
3. All lobbies and skylobbies are placed so that the special eight-width statues/fountains/entrances appear on the left.
4. There's a grand escalator at the very center of the main lobby leading up to a matched pair of coffee shops.
5. Everything is symmetrical, except for the elevators (and they're mostly symmetrical): a tenant on the left side always has a matching tenant on the right side, etc.
   1. This includes the recycling centers, which are symmetrically placed in the basement on either side of the central metro station. Because recycling centers have to built contiguously, they needed a temporary ""bridge"" of recycling centers to get them to the other side. After construction, this bridge was demolished to make way for the metro station and shops.
6. There's a nice variety of eating and shopping establishments for each 15-story block of floors, especially with establishments in the 128-visitation limit. It doesn't change anything, but it's nice to think of the residents being able to choose between a burger, ice cream, soba, Chinese food, etc.
7. Shopping and dining establishments tend to be paired: a soba noodle fast food shop is next to its sushi restaurant sibling, a French restaurant tends to be next to a flower shop or coffee shop, etc.
8. All elevators are either evenly and symmetrically spaced or clustered as centrally as possible.
9. The top elevator is both aligned with the elevator above it and provides access to the cathedral in a discreet space off to the side, without requiring any empty floor space.
10. There's a security office directly above the metro station to keep an eye on all those potential troublemaking commuters and to serve as a central organizing hub for the other security offices.
11. The condominium people at the very top block are consistently the happiest, as people living in penthouses with the very best of views, dining, shopping, medicine, and security should be.
12. The tower is as placed as close to the center of the map as possible while still being constrained by the other criteria: the broad base, the symmetry of the overall tower, the special lobby part displaying in each lobby and sky lobby, just one type of tenant per floor, shopping/dining optimized per block, no empty floor space, and the hotel suite people being happy (which means 10-segment-wide hotel suites have to be on the first floors because of the short, direct elevator rides, so the base has to be a multiple of 10).

It's a good tower! I'm very grateful to the many good people and very good advice here. Particularly:

There are a few things I'm wondering how to support better:

1. Yellow ""good"" ratings appear sometimes. The ""double hotel room"" block sometimes has a couple. The ""hotel suite"" block has rarely has one. The ""lower condo"" block is predictably half-yellow, half-blue on the 1st weekday mornings. These yellow ratings gradually change to all blue as the week goes on, but they also appear no matter how many elevators or express elevators I support them with.
2. Sometimes there are red people waiting for elevators on the 75th floor, after the party halls get out. Even though they're outside people, I'd like them to be able to have a better experience visiting the tower.
3. It'd be nice to replace one of the blocks of condominiums with more hotels, but using more than one service elevator for housekeeping seems to reduce the number of housekeepers deployed to the lesser of housekeepers assigned from either one, crippling cleaning capability.
4. Anything else up for suggestion!

Anyway, thanks for being such a good community, for letting me be such a lurker, and for building such awesome towers!",5,1767755217.0,SimTower,0,1.0,False

Protein: 20g  Taste: 3/5  Overall:3.5/5

This is my first soy protein, I bought it cuz it’s the most well-known one. First, I don’t really like the taste cuz it’s really ‘healthy’ven I added oat milk or fruits, it doesn’t help at all. But the price is really nice tho, $49 with 2 pound it’s already good for me. The amount of protein just in the average,It can blend well if I use the blending stick, not really good if just shake it.



* [THE VEGAN Plant Based Protein Powder (Valina)](https://thevegan.pse.is/THEVEGAN_1KG_Vanilla_CURRY)

(Taiwan brand)

Protein: 25g Taste: 5/5 Overall: 4.5/5

I found this brand unintentionally; it seems like a new brand but it’s already been famous in Taiwan.I already tried the coffee, oat milk, vanila. And my fav is the oat milk.I was not really interested in it before until I found out its flavors are really cool. This is my first time trying oat milk flavor and it really taste like one! Added coffee, cereals, fruits even make it better! it would be blended well if I use the blending stick too, with shaking it’s also fine but need to drink it quickly. But the problem is the price, $49 with 2.2lb it’s a little pricey for me, but I think it’s also makes sense since it’s a foreign brand, About the protein amount, this one is 25g, but the number will be different if the flavor changes, the highest one is 28g (plant flavor). It’s also added vitamins and probiotics etc, all nutrition in one it is. I bought the plain flavor this time since it’s on sale, I would recommend this brand if you want to try soy protein!

Protein; 13g, Taste:3/5 Overall:4/5

This one it’s also well-known, so I am excited to try it. First, the taste it’s too sweet for me, I think it’s cuz the sweetener they choose, Im not really into this taste.. but the chocolate one is better! What’s good is, the price is very very good! I think it would be the cheapest of these three. It can help me to stay full and be a meal replacement. I think I would but it again if I’m out of budget.

1q63yk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q63yk0/was_my_idea_right/,Was my idea right?,"Every morning, Mrs. Calder left a mug on the low brick wall between the houses. “Too much coffee,” she’d say if anyone asked. “I can’t drink it all.” Mr. Henson would nod, thank her, and carry it inside. It became a habit, one of those quiet neighborly exchanges that don’t feel like much until they stop.
At first, he just felt tired. Then came the headaches, dull and constant, like weather moving through his skull. He blamed age, stress, the way the house never quite warmed up in winter. Mrs. Calder noticed everything. She asked if he was sleeping enough, if he was eating properly. Her concern felt practiced, smooth. The mugs kept coming.

Weeks passed. Mr. Henson began forgetting small things—where he left his keys, how long he’d been standing in a room. One afternoon, he spilled the coffee on the counter and saw a faint shimmer in the liquid before it soaked into the wood. He stared at the stain longer than necessary, unsettled, but said nothing. Confrontation had never been his strength.

When the ambulance finally came, Mrs. Calder stood on her porch with her hands folded, watching the doors close. Later that evening, she rinsed two mugs in the sink, dried them carefully, and placed only one back in the cupboard. The brick wall between the houses sat empty the next morning, catching the sun as if nothing had ever rested there at all. ",2,1767755192.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Rating: 7.5/10
""Honestly a solid piece for winter. I dig the reversible feature—the fleece side looks cozy, but the nylon side in this pic looks a bit deflated and wrinkly. Might need a steam or some wear to puff it up properly. The Coyote/Brown colorway is versatile, but the zipper hardware looks a little flimsy in the photo. Good daily driver, but nothing mind-blowing.""

2. The North Face Nuptse (Black)
**Rating: 8/10**
""You can't really go wrong with a black Nuptse, it’s a staple for a reason. That said, it is the 'NPC uniform' of winter. The puffiness here looks decent, not too flat. My main gripe with these is usually the collar shape—sometimes it sits weirdly against the neck. If the down fill is good, it’s a keep, but don't expect to stand out in a crowd.""

3. Ami Paris Big Heart Sweater
**Rating: 6/10**
""Unpopular opinion maybe, but the massive Ami de Coeur logo is getting a bit played out. It screams 'I bought this for the logo.' The grey knit looks clean and the stitching on the 'A' seems tight, but I’m worried about the wool quality. These tend to pill super fast or feel itchy if the material blend is cheap. Clean look, just a bit basic.""

4. Purple Brand Denim Jacket
**Rating: 5.5/10**
""This is... a lot. The paint splatter and distress effect feels a bit forced and artificial in this lighting. It gives off strong 2016 hypebeast vibes. If you style it with plain black pants it might work, but it’s a loud piece. The fit on Purple Brand is usually tight/fitted, so if you prefer the boxy/baggy trend, you might hate how this sits.""

5. Gallery Dept. Long Sleeve Tee
Rating: 7/10**
""Clean graphic. The 'Bar Dé Music' print is one of their better, more low-key designs. The blank looks decent, maybe a bit thin? The cuffs look like they might lose elasticity quickly. It’s a cool layering piece, but for what it is (literally a cotton long sleeve), it’s nothing crazy. Good for a chill fit.""

6. Acne Studios 'Mud Wash' / Chain Print Jeans
Rating: 9/10**
""Best item in the haul, hands down. The wash and the trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) chain print are sick. It fits that grimey/grunge aesthetic perfectly. My only concern is styling—these are hard to pull off without looking like you literally rolled in dirt. If you have the right boots and cropped top/hoodie, these are fire. If not, they just look messy.""

7. Velvet Track Jacket**
Rating: 7/10
""The velvet texture looks plush, definitely a comfy piece. It is huge right now, so the hype is there. However, black velvet is a lint magnet. You are going to be using a lint roller every time you leave the house. Also, the elastic banding at the hem looks a little loose/cheap. Good for a cozy UK drip vibe, but high maintenance.""

8. Off-White 'Out of Office' (OOO) Sneakers
Rating: 8.5/10**
""Super clean colorway. The white and grey is way more wearable than the loud colors Off-White usually does. The leather cuts look smooth and the shape is correct (chunky but not clown shoes). Just be warned, these are heavy on foot. If you plan on walking all day in these, your feet might get tired. Solid pickup.""

9. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Taupe)
Rating: 9.5/10**
""Certified classic. You literally cannot hate on these. The suede looks buttery and the color is perfect for neutral tones. They go with sweatpants, jeans, shorts, whatever. The only downside is keeping that suede clean—one drop of coffee or rain and it's game over. Make sure you spray them with protector immediately.""

10. Purple Brand Distressed Jeans (Black)
Rating: 5/10
""Meh. Similar to the jacket, the distressing here looks kinda cheap, specifically the checkered patches peeking through. It feels very 'mall fashion.' The skinny/stacked fit is also kind of dying out in favor of baggy denim. If you're going for a rockstar look, they work, but otherwise, I’d pass on these for something with a better wash.""

11. Fear of God Essentials 1/2 Zip Pullover (Nylon)
Rating: 7/10
""This is way better than their standard cotton hoodies that everyone and their grandma wears. The nylon gives it a nice technical/sporty vibe while keeping that signature boxy FOG silhouette. My only issue with these is the material noise—you literally sound like a walking bag of chips when you move. Also, the elastic on the waist looks really aggressive; expect it to ride up constantly if you don't layer it right.""

12. 'Lucky Me I See Ghosts' Hoodie (Kids See Ghosts)**
Rating: 6.5/10
""Ah, the holy grail of 2018 hypebeasts. Honestly, this piece feels a bit dated now. The puff print on the text looks decent—it’s got that 3D texture you want—but be careful washing it because that puff *will* crack and peel eventually. The wash on the grey fabric looks okay, maybe a bit too dark compared to retail, but it's hard to tell without natural light. Cool for the nostalgia, but a bit loud for 2026.""

13. Ralph Lauren Pony Socks (3-Pack)
Rating: 8/10
""Not much to say here, they are socks. You're paying for the little horse embroidery, let's be real. They are definitely cleaner than standard Nike socks for wearing with loafers or low-top sneakers like the OOOs or Birkenstocks you posted earlier. They tend to pill after a few washes though, so enjoy the crisp white look while it lasts. Solid essential.""

14. Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Sweater (Cream)**
Rating: 8.5/10
""This is the 'Old Money' starter pack final boss. It’s a super safe, versatile piece that makes you look put-together instantly. The cable knitting gives it good texture so it doesn't look cheap. It pairs perfectly with the fatigue pants or denim from your previous haul. Just make sure it’s not too thin; some of the newer RL knits feel flimsy. If the weight is good, this is a wardrobe staple.""

Turns out this definitely is a thing and seems to be a fairly popular type of pour over. I’m just worried the brew won’t be strong enough because the coffee will go through too fast. I’m thinking maybe there’s a type of paper filter that is thicker and will slow the flow down a bit? The info in the box says it takes a conical V60 filter (or a basket filter?- that I’m not clear on). Would greatly appreciate recommendations on filter brands for a stronger brew (if possible with this type of pour over) or any info that is good to know when using this type of V60 dripper.

I’m 35, single, active, and have built a life I really enjoy. I work out, spend a lot of time outside, travel when I want, and I’m hoping to meet someone who’s in a similar place lifestyle-wise. I’m also 5’11, so height does matter to me (I know, I know, just being honest 🙈).

I’ve genuinely done the “do things you like and you’ll meet someone” advice. I’ve joined run clubs, sports leagues (tennis, pickleball), gone to meetups, and joined hobby groups I now attend regularly (love board games 🤓), and also specific dating events (those have been the least promising ironically). All of that has been great, I’ve made friends and built community, but I’ve never met a man I’m attracted to (either initially or over time) through any of these things.

The only times I notice men I’m attracted to are total drive-by situations: standing in line at a coffee shop, passing each other on Lady Bird Lake, etc. Obviously, in those moments I have no idea if they’re single (aside from married ones), and there’s also zero context for starting a conversation. Like… you don’t stop someone mid-run, right?

So I guess I’m wondering:
	•	For my fellow tall women who met their partner in Austin (especially if height and lifestyle compatibility mattered to you ) where did it actually happen?
	•	Is randomly approaching someone in places like coffee shops actually normal and successful, or does it mostly feel as awkward as I imagine it does? I’m assuming chasing someone down on the trail is just as creepy as it sounds.

This isn’t about having “high standards” so much as having specific ones that match who I am and the life I’ve already built.

A friend and I have half-jokingly talked about setting up a lemonade stand on the trail as a social experiment… but I figured I’d crowdsource here first to see if there are less cringey ideas 😅",2,1767754702.0,Austin,13,0.55,False
1q63q5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1q63q5u/agency_forensics_the_anatomy_of_a_simple_binary/,“Agency” Forensics: The Anatomy of a Simple Binary Choice,"Choice takes many forms, but all forms can be broken down into external, conscious and unconscious determinants that constrain them. 

When our actions are reflexive, they’re not based on conscious choice at all. They’re driven by unconscious determinants (biological, neural, conditioned) and constrained by external determinants (trigger/context). 

Some actions taken consciously also have no case for influence of a conscious or unconscious determinant. A coin flip is entirely subject to the external determinant of chance, and being subject to randomness is no kind of freedom. 

The simplest form of choice where all three determinant categories come into play is a simple binary selection. Let’s say our options at a very basic coffee shop are just black coffee or plain English breakfast tea, at the same cost per cup.

External determinants are already at play. Availability and costs. These determinants may give some people no choice based on taste, health restrictions, or finances. 

Unconscious determinants of choice include conditioning, the aforementioned personal taste and one’s current mood. These intersect with the constraints of the external determinants.

The potential override of the unconscious determinants is conscious reasoning. If agency is to be found anywhere, it is here. 

But what reasoning is there really in this simple binary case? 

If one already enjoys one of the options (or severely dislikes the other), then it may be conscious, but it’s not really *reasoning,* to say “well I’ll take what I prefer”. The preference is an unconscious determinant. 

If there is no strong like or dislike, that in itself is an unconscious determinant requiring reasoning. If reasoning is required within bounds of external determinants and to account for a lack of unconscious preference, then the act of reasoning is determined by these factors.

If you’re weighing recent choices (“I’ve had coffee the last few days”), your reasoning is supplied by habit or value, in turn shaped by unconscious or external (availability) determinants.

If you pick tea because you heard it’s healthier, your reasoning is based on conditioning by external sources.

If you seek agency by mastering and overriding all unconscious determinants, your reasoning - even from explicit intention and self-reflection - will still be based on external determinants, including your genetically defined capacity for thinking, the information you possess, and back to the limits in availability, cost constraints, etc. 

Compatibilism asserts that we have responsibility for the choice between coffee and tea in that our actions arise from what we ultimately tell ourselves are our motives for the choice. If I choose tea for health (based on prior learning and socialization to wellness concerns), the fact that I can explain the action with a motive assigns me responsibility. The *subjective feeling* of freely choosing is real (as a feeling), as we are the subjective locus of learning from prior acts (“doctor said my prior coffee choices are responsible for this health issue), simulate outcomes in this case, and arrive at a motive for our choice. 

However, since the origin of those motives is ultimately outside our control (availability, conditioning, biological health), compatibilist freedom is observing “agency within constraints,” not a *freedom from causation*. Deciding which motives to follow (“I prefer coffee” OR “I *should* have tea”, implies agency meaningful for ethics and self-understanding, given a typical biological capacity for reasoning. But this statement alone indicates that this agency - even in deciding between coffee or tea - is reliant on a causal chain of biology, personal history, and a lot of circumstance.",1,1767754580.0,freewill,2,1.0,False

Here's what I've learned.

Don't use onboard usb.  Get a good pci-e USB card that has a SATA power connecter.  Pulls the voltage issues away from the pci-e bus.

Go into device manager and show all hidden devices and uninstall all old pens.  Major flag here if you had an old Wacom tablet.

If using multiple displays try to match your refresh rates of the monitor you're cloning and the tablet.  Sometimes this helps when the pen feels laggy.

I was in a toxic relationship that slowly turned abusive. I felt trapped in a cycle where I’d try to leave, then get convinced to stay because I was told things would get better. They never did.

During that time, I asked my mom and my sister for help multiple times. At first, they said yes. But because I didn’t always follow through immediately (since I was still stuck in the abuse cycle), they now use that against me and say I “broke my promises.”

Eventually, I did leave for good. My mom lives about an hour and a half away, and my sister lives 20 minutes away. I moved in with my mom temporarily. My sister told me directly that I could move in with her on Tuesday.

What I later found out is that the entire time, my sister was telling my mom she didn’t want me to move in — while still telling me that I could. On Tuesday, the actual day she told me to come, she backed out.

This hurts even more because my sister and I already have a painful history. She’s stolen money from me in the past, was cruel to me growing up, borderline bullied me, and has often rejected me as a sister. I honestly thought that during something this serious, she would show up for me. She didn’t.

When I got upset about being rejected last minute, I was told I was selfish. My mom said I was “just like my dad,” that the world doesn’t revolve around me, and that because I put myself in this situation, I should get myself out of it. She also said that since help was offered before and I didn’t take it, no one wants to help me now.

That really broke me. I already feel like no one cares about what I go through, and this felt like confirmation of that. I was so hurt and angry that I threw my coffee at my mom’s door before leaving.

I know that wasn’t okay, but I was overwhelmed and felt completely abandoned.

Am I actually wrong here like my family says? Or is it reasonable to feel betrayed and hurt by this?",5,1767754337.0,amiwrong,5,1.0,False

1q63l1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1q63l1j/i_recently_got_to_know_why_dating_is_not_working/,I Recently got to know why dating is not working.,"I'm a 29F looking for a serious kinda relationship that can be turned to marriage. I made my profile on hinge and I got a match from this guy who was okish and asked me out 3-4 times so I finally met him. When we met on coffee he didn't look very interested at that time then he asked me to come to his place, I was a bit hesitant since it was a first date but I finally took a plunge. Till this time I  was also not very attracted towards him. Then  he told me he is looking for serious relationship but he would get to know this if we spend quite a time and have some physical intimacy like kissing cuddling. ""Physical intimacy"" this is something that I as woman would like to go for at the last when I'm sure that he is the one. Else I don't want to feel used like a tissue paper. What if later he decides that I'm not the one made for him. So after that date we didn't go for another as according to him I'm not clear in my mind what I need. Now next I met another guy on hinge. He was decent looking and had a good bg. He told me he is also looking for a serious date to marry relationship. So I said let's meet or go for a walk on weekend and get to know eachother and this time I got a similar reply. He said ""I don't want to meet in public place where people pretend to be somebody else. Instead I want a home date where we can watch tv cook something together"". And we girls clearly know what it means when a guy is calling you to there home. Nd it becomes more difficult to say no when you are inside there territory. 

As a woman what I look for is the way you talk to me if I feel attracted towards you, if your sense of humor is good to decide if I would like to go further but for boys it's not the same.

I already had one casual relationship in past where I got really attached to that guy and later he said he doesn't want a serious relationship at this point of time. 
And maybe this is the reason I don't want to put myself there and say all the guys are same . 

Guys out there am I right about you? And do you all have the same dating pattern?

1q63ke1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q63ke1/loot_items_needed_for_expedition_load_stage_stage/,"Loot Items Needed for Expedition Load Stage (Stage 5), Loot Categorization (Loot Taxonomy)","I'm working on the second expedition, the one for early 2026. In it, you have to commit items from four categories:

1. Combat Items worth 200K coin
2. Survival Items worth 100K coin
3. Provision worth 150K coin
4. Materials worth 300K coin.

The categories show icons for the items, but what the game accepts for each category can be tricky.

For example, the provisions group has a nature icon. One would think it would accept all plants and seeds, but it does not. For example, it takes seeds, but does not take Great Mullein. (Maybe Mullein is under survival items? I've already finished that, so I cannot tell.)

So, I tried to create a table of what we'll need for the provisions category... and went down a rabbit hole.

What I've found is confusion around how Embark categorizes loot items. For example, look at [Advanced Electrical Components - ARC Raiders Wiki](https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Advanced_Electrical_Components). You'll see an image matching what you get from the in-game tool tip.

* It shows a wrench icon, which matches the stash category of crafting materials.
* It says the item is part of the ""Refined Material"" group.
* It says the item is rare.

So, for a loot categorization (taxonomy), we have at least three items:

1. Stash Category (Augments, Shields, Weapons, Ammo, etc.)
2. Loot Type ( Advanced Material, Basic Material, Key, Nature, etc.)
3. Rarity

There is also an axis needed for Spawn Location Types. These are shown on the maps, but aren't officially listed versus individual loot items.

Here is a table showing what I've found so far. Please provide comments and corrections and I'll update this post. This will let search engines and AI find correct data. Thanks!

I got refunded for the milk already, but I don’t want to waste it. I wanted to err on the side of caution in case it ‘goes bad’ by the time I finish my current carton. 

I still have half of my already-opened half-gallon left. I can eat cereals for breakfast in addition to the usual splash with my coffee in the mornings to try and power through the milk quicker. It usually takes me 1-2 weeks to finish a half-gallon if used for coffee only. 

Should I wrap the bottom in plastic wrap and try to keep it in the fridge anyways? Transfer it to a used plastic bottle (simply lemonade) and try to freeze it? I’m not sure I have freezer space lol.

1q63j8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1q63j8q/i_might_have_sibo_methane_new_here_please_help/,I might have SIBO methane? New here please help (symptoms for 6+years),"Hello, I'm looking for answers here because I've been on and off fighting my symptoms and conditions for more than 6 years now.  
It started small but over the years it has only turnout worse and I cant live a normal life now.  
  
2017 - had strong acid reflux with cofee and other foods (cut everything coffee, alchohol etc)  
2018 - had small lactose intolerance symptoms, bloating, excessive burping (cut milk, switched to yogurts, and avoided milk in general)  
also in 2018 had my 1st endoscopy that said everything was fine, no treatment, just some anti-acids. At the time I thought the bloating and burping was only due to the lactose intolerance and reflux.

From 2019 to 2022 the excess air, bloating, burping, acompained with fast beating heart and some chest pains, sometimes even sweating got progressevly worse. Now I have pain in esophagus and stomach, like pin needles and burning in the neck and chest.   
Some Doctors at the time said the heart racing was ansiety...  
Then in I changed doctor and did the 2nd endoscopy and 1st colonoscopy this time. Turns out I was diagnosed with both esophagy and gastritis.   
They also checked for H. Pylori because of my bloating and air complaints. But tested negative for H. Pylori, 2 times (breath test and endocopy sample).  
I have treated esophagy and gastritis both with Lanzoprazol mainly.  
  
But I still have the symptoms of bloating, excess burping, excess air in stomach, chest, (99% of air comes up instead of down), this gives me pain and heart racing (120bpm to 130bpm in the worst days)  
Sometimes I even wake up with a racing heart to then proceed to expels all the air burping, and when I have less air the heart resumes to close to normal.

Went to a new gastro, he said I was depressed and it was ansiety, gut brain axis etc. (they allways do it seems)

But finally I went to cardiologist, he said it was Roemheld Syndrome. The heart and the brain was not the problem. It is a dygestive issue that causes excess air, bloating, slow digestion.   
The air compresses the diafragm and muscles in the torax and cause the heart to beat fast. That and the slow digestion, the body tries hard to process the food for too long makes me feel weak and tired.

So now, I'm looking into SIBO, It was not H.Pylori, but some other bacteria is causing the fermentation and producing all this air and bloating.  


To give you an idea, I sometimes pass 1 day eating only 1 boiled egg, 1 boiled apple, and 1 cup of oatmeal hydrated with water. And im never hungry, on the contrary I'm allways full.

Before all this I was an atlhetic type, low weight but had good muscle, and I loved to eat, I used to eat everything and healthy too.  
But now, I avoid eating everyday, only do it because Im worried of getting weak and low nutrition.

Current symptoms are, I have a full hard belly everytime I eat, and I eat very little, I'm never hungry. Sometimes I wake up full of air in the stomach and chest, first thing i do i burp for 30min before even thinking about eating.  
I avoid all lactose, the intolerance has gotten worse, it makes me go straigth to the bathroom, but at least when it's the lactose I don't burp for 3hours straigth.

The worst symptoms I have right now are the excess air, speacially with the heart racing, and waking up with air and heart racing.  
The only thing I take is Semiticone (Aero-OM 125mg) for the air, I think it helps but it's not treating anything and doesnt act fast when i have a crisis... I also think I took Proton Inibitors (lanzoprazol) for too long that made the symptoms worse.

I think I have SIBO, the methane predominan, because it's the first time I find something that describes all the symptoms I have.  
I'm even surprised no doctor before mentioned this and allways think I'm just crazy or have ansiety.

I'm looking into which exams I can do to dignose this condition. Also I'm trying to understand the diet, it's not very straightforward.  
Over the years I've removed many things from my diet, trying and testing, but I allways have some symptom crisis and most of the time cant point to what caused it.

Sorry for the long post.

1q63ies,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q63ies,"Am I an NPC or a Hypebeast? A bit of both. | 10KG Haul Review: TNF, Ami, Purple Brand vs. Acne, RL, Birkenstock","1. Carhartt WIP Reversible Puffer Jacket**
Rating: 7.5/10
""Honestly a solid piece for winter. I dig the reversible feature—the fleece side looks cozy, but the nylon side in this pic looks a bit deflated and wrinkly. Might need a steam or some wear to puff it up properly. The Coyote/Brown colorway is versatile, but the zipper hardware looks a little flimsy in the photo. Good daily driver, but nothing mind-blowing.""

2. The North Face Nuptse (Black)
**Rating: 8/10**
""You can't really go wrong with a black Nuptse, it’s a staple for a reason. That said, it is the 'NPC uniform' of winter. The puffiness here looks decent, not too flat. My main gripe with these is usually the collar shape—sometimes it sits weirdly against the neck. If the down fill is good, it’s a keep, but don't expect to stand out in a crowd.""

3. Ami Paris Big Heart Sweater
**Rating: 6/10**
""Unpopular opinion maybe, but the massive Ami de Coeur logo is getting a bit played out. It screams 'I bought this for the logo.' The grey knit looks clean and the stitching on the 'A' seems tight, but I’m worried about the wool quality. These tend to pill super fast or feel itchy if the material blend is cheap. Clean look, just a bit basic.""

4. Purple Brand Denim Jacket
**Rating: 5.5/10**
""This is... a lot. The paint splatter and distress effect feels a bit forced and artificial in this lighting. It gives off strong 2016 hypebeast vibes. If you style it with plain black pants it might work, but it’s a loud piece. The fit on Purple Brand is usually tight/fitted, so if you prefer the boxy/baggy trend, you might hate how this sits.""

5. Gallery Dept. Long Sleeve Tee
Rating: 7/10**
""Clean graphic. The 'Bar Dé Music' print is one of their better, more low-key designs. The blank looks decent, maybe a bit thin? The cuffs look like they might lose elasticity quickly. It’s a cool layering piece, but for what it is (literally a cotton long sleeve), it’s nothing crazy. Good for a chill fit.""

6. Acne Studios 'Mud Wash' / Chain Print Jeans
Rating: 9/10**
""Best item in the haul, hands down. The wash and the trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) chain print are sick. It fits that grimey/grunge aesthetic perfectly. My only concern is styling—these are hard to pull off without looking like you literally rolled in dirt. If you have the right boots and cropped top/hoodie, these are fire. If not, they just look messy.""

7. Corteiz Velvet Track Jacket**
Rating: 7/10
""The velvet texture looks plush, definitely a comfy piece. Corteiz is huge right now, so the hype is there. However, black velvet is a lint magnet. You are going to be using a lint roller every time you leave the house. Also, the elastic banding at the hem looks a little loose/cheap. Good for a cozy UK drip vibe, but high maintenance.""

8. Off-White 'Out of Office' (OOO) Sneakers
Rating: 8.5/10**
""Super clean colorway. The white and grey is way more wearable than the loud colors Off-White usually does. The leather cuts look smooth and the shape is correct (chunky but not clown shoes). Just be warned, these are heavy on foot. If you plan on walking all day in these, your feet might get tired. Solid pickup.""

9. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Taupe)
Rating: 9.5/10**
""Certified classic. You literally cannot hate on these. The suede looks buttery and the color is perfect for neutral tones. They go with sweatpants, jeans, shorts, whatever. The only downside is keeping that suede clean—one drop of coffee or rain and it's game over. Make sure you spray them with protector immediately.""

10. Purple Brand Distressed Jeans (Black)
Rating: 5/10
""Meh. Similar to the jacket, the distressing here looks kinda cheap, specifically the checkered patches peeking through. It feels very 'mall fashion.' The skinny/stacked fit is also kind of dying out in favor of baggy denim. If you're going for a rockstar look, they work, but otherwise, I’d pass on these for something with a better wash.""

11. Fear of God Essentials 1/2 Zip Pullover (Nylon)
Rating: 7/10
""This is way better than their standard cotton hoodies that everyone and their grandma wears. The nylon gives it a nice technical/sporty vibe while keeping that signature boxy FOG silhouette. My only issue with these is the material noise—you literally sound like a walking bag of chips when you move. Also, the elastic on the waist looks really aggressive; expect it to ride up constantly if you don't layer it right.""

12. 'Lucky Me I See Ghosts' Hoodie (Kids See Ghosts)**
Rating: 6.5/10
""Ah, the holy grail of 2018 hypebeasts. Honestly, this piece feels a bit dated now. The puff print on the text looks decent—it’s got that 3D texture you want—but be careful washing it because that puff *will* crack and peel eventually. The wash on the grey fabric looks okay, maybe a bit too dark compared to retail, but it's hard to tell without natural light. Cool for the nostalgia, but a bit loud for 2026.""

13. Ralph Lauren Pony Socks (3-Pack)
Rating: 8/10
""Not much to say here, they are socks. You're paying for the little horse embroidery, let's be real. They are definitely cleaner than standard Nike socks for wearing with loafers or low-top sneakers like the OOOs or Birkenstocks you posted earlier. They tend to pill after a few washes though, so enjoy the crisp white look while it lasts. Solid essential.""

14. Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Sweater (Cream)**
Rating: 8.5/10
""This is the 'Old Money' starter pack final boss. It’s a super safe, versatile piece that makes you look put-together instantly. The cable knitting gives it good texture so it doesn't look cheap. It pairs perfectly with the fatigue pants or denim from your previous haul. Just make sure it’s not too thin; some of the newer RL knits feel flimsy. If the weight is good, this is a wardrobe staple.""

1q6368u,https://i.redd.it/4qaz07an9ubg1.jpeg,From Atty Joel R. Dizon,"I won’t lie about it, I feel sorry that my kumpadre Konsi Jose “Joemol” Molintas left the community chatgroup “1Sambayan Baguio” because he felt that people were being unfair to Benjie Magalong and to a handful of councilors, himself included, who are perceived to be “pro-SM.”
     There are conspiracy theories aswirl about an attempt to call an emergency special session of the City Council on December 29 to try to swing a “midnight vote” approving the SM proposal before the year ended. 
    Let's examine the timeline again.
     SM’s letter of withdrawal, signed by SM Prime’s Vice-president for Legal Affairs Helene Go was dated December 19, 2025. 
    But of course it was NOT received on that day itself, which was a Friday. It must have been delivered by personal service only on Monday, December 22, which was the first immediately following working day from the 19th. 
        By the way, the observation that the letter was not stamped ""received"" is meaningless. If you are delivering a letter personally, it is YOUR copy that would have the receiving stamp, not the copy that you left with the addressee. 
     On that point, Benjie wasn’t lying. He did not yet inform the City Council about the letter on December 22 and the Council session that afternoon was NOT a “moro-moro.”
     The councilors really did NOT know about SM’s withdrawal yet—which is why they agreed to convene for FINAL DELIBERATIONS on January 5 and then to VOTE on the Lease Contract on January 9.
    That locked out the calendar of the City Council for the rest of the Christmas break, making it legally and technically almost impossible  to convene on December 29, even by the unlikely scenario of the Mayor himself calling for the special session--which he CAN actually do, under the General Welfare clause of the Local Government Code.
     Benjie said in an interview he didn’t announce SM’s letter anymore because he didn’t want to spoil the festive holiday atmosphere. That's a likely story, but he could have just said there was nothing to be achieved by publicly announcing it anymore because the City Council had, in fact, already ADJOURNED for the year.
     So why didn’t he just INFORMALLY tell the councilors in caucus about SM’s withdrawal? Why did he wait till after the New Year?
     I will speculate here—stop me if I’m being illogical.
     I think Benjie tried his best to salvage the SM Plan--and there's NOTHING illegal about that. He had been authorized by formal resolution to negotiate with SM and that includes sparing no effort no matter how desperate to see the plan through. All is fair in love and war--and in contract negotiations. 
     I think he read Helene Go’s letter and wondered why there was no Board Resolution from SM Prime Holdings, Inc. authorizing her to pull out from a P4.5-BILLION risk venture attached to the letter.
     SMPHI is a publicly-listed corporation with shares of stock being actively-traded in the Philippine Stock Exchange.  Benjie is smart enough to have checked the bourse’s digital bulletin board (as I did) and observed that SMPH had not made any disclosures about its intention to fold up a P4.5-BILLION project, news of which had excited its shareholders in the last 5 years.
     So Benjie must have thought (as I would have) that Helene Go’s letter was a bluff. I don’t know that it ISN’T. Was SM’s intention merely to float a test balloon and see how the Baguio LGU would react? Was that letter a reckless experiment that went awry?
     Whatever it was, I think Benjie reacted by telling everyone who mattered  that there’s only one way to make SM reconsider, change its mind and withdraw its withdrawal letter—and that is to “surprise” it with a pre-emptive approval BEFORE January 9. That must be why he held his silence until the eve of the final deliberations by the City Council on January 5.  
     BEFORE this, I’m pretty sure he burned the proverbial telephone line to each councilor—but did not have an opportunity to seat them all in one room and make a desperate final pitch for SM. How can he, they have adjourned for the holidays. 
     But that’s not the worst part. By this time, before Christmas, Paolo Salvosa had leveled with his wedding ninong and told him, “I’m sorry, ninong, but I’m voting NO.”
      I never doubted that Benjamin Salvosa's grandson would vote NO—if it came to a vote. I asked him difficult favor after difficult favor in my own research—and he gave me everything I needed to the absolute limit that he can do legally.  I had to connect the dots myself, of course.
     I don’t know if Paolo influenced anyone else among his young peers, Van Dicang and Yuri Weygan, but they soon also both intimated that they were leaning towards NO. 
     I am ALMOST sure Benjie sought counsel from Joemol, both as to the technicality of calling a special session by executive initiative, and how he sizes up his colleagues regarding their votes.
    I am willing to go out on a limb that this is what Joe told Benjie. About that special session, it’s do-able but ill-advised. In the halcyon days of the pre-martial law Congress, whenever it was technically possible to pass a controversial piece of legislation, the senators would still always ask themselves the last critical question, “Can we defend this in Plaza Miranda?”
     I’m sure Joe said something about Konsi Peter Fianza’s report, “we cannot ignore it.”
     When I thought the City Council would vote on December 22, I personally begged to Joemol the night  before.
     “Joe, your vote is crucial. Whichever way you go, many of your colleagues will follow you.  You know the City can’t deliver the project site free-and-clear even in six MONTHS. You know the City WILL DEFAULT. But with a signed contract, this time you know the City will be liable. You know it.”
    He answered, “Yes I am not ready to vote, I find inadequate reason to say NO for now, but I am convinced the people are not ready to go for the proposed develoment. Let us be patient for now.”
    Regardless how he excruciatingly worded it, that was a NO,  I’m convinced. So convinced I told Luchie Maranan, “Joe is coming home. He will vote for the people.”
     “Oh, my goodness, really? For sure?”
     “No, but I’m working on it.”
     That afternoon, Joe pm’ed me, “let’s have coffee and discuss strategy. Let’s start with Peter’s report.”
     I didn’t meet Joemol for that coffee anymore. If he was mindful of Peter's report, then I knew already where he stands. So I chose  to just  honor his independence. And I wasn’t wrong. I’m sure it was him who drove the wooden stake through the heart of the market mallification--he was the only one brave enough to tell Benjie, “never mind any special sessions. We don’t have the numbers…and even if we did, do you think we can defend this in Malcolm Square?”
     To tell this story, I had to break the confidence of Joe and Paolo.  I HAD TO. 
     Even in my own chatgroup, people were creaming Joemol, Paolo and EVEN Peter Fianza—can you believe THAT? I’ve already seen a couple of satirical cartoons of a character that kind of resembled Paolo—wearing a shirt with a UC logo on it.  That was below the belt and totally ignorant of the facts that were speculative at best--that Paolo would have voted YES. Not a chance.
    Throughout this entire anti-mallification saga, I’ve laid down my own ground rules: no name-calling and no bashing with or without basis. Most importantly, no expanding the issues.
     We’re talking here of only ONE resolution, ONE voting.
     The City Council Voted NO-- fourteen-to-zero. No abstentions. What MORE can you ask for?
     Alright, if you want ""slide rule exactitude"" they all voted YES to (1) terminating  the PPP process with respect to SM, (2) returning the SM proposal back to SM, (3) directing Helene Go to submit the Board Resolution evidencing her authority to withdraw SM's proposal, (4) formally declaring that by reason of withdrawal, the City Council's act of returning the proposal to SM shall be deemed a disapproval, (5) declaring it unnecessary to revoke SM's Original Proponent Status because the same had lapsed beyond its shelf life of one year from date of certification--all of that, by multiple integrated amendments...with pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. 
    So many, in fact, were the ""irreversibles"" added to Joemol's motion (yes, it WAS Joe who moved for the main question, after sustaining a rewording amendment from Lulu Tabanda) that SM's proposal could NEVER be revived if you pumped a gallon of adrenalin into its dead veins.
    It was over, dead, period. Tetelestai.
    There’s no reason to carry on any lingering rancor towads anyone—especially if it is based on a wrong assumption, and visited upon someone you wouldn’t even give a chance to speak out in his own defense.  
    That's what constrained Joemol to leave 1Sambayan. I would grieve that loss.
    It was a long, bruising fight but in the end the People of Baguio won. Democracy won. Justice won. Imperfect as it is, and will always be, I remain proud of the City Council of Baguio City for the ultimate manner in which they took action. 
     They balked, they  faltered, they groused, they took offense and sassed, they hissed and clawed because so did ALL of us. But in the end, we get to KEEP OUR CITY PUBLIC  MARKET and that, ladies and gentlemen, is ALL that matters to me. 
    And if you don’t agree with THAT, I really don’t care.*

It was manufactured in 09/2022 purchased in 03/2023 and they have pulled about 250 shots total. They are asking for 5,600,000 Won (roughly $3,900). It will come with the wood accent kit, Acaia Lunar (connected version for brew by weight capabilities) with drip trey mod, .06 mm flow restrictor swap, direct line kit. I calculated that it’s over $1K in accessories.

Some questions for the group:
- Does this seem like a fair price for this machine with the accessories?
- If not, what should I aim for?
- Is anyone currently in Korea and can give me the low down on espresso enthusiasts groups here?
- I’ll likely take it with me when I move in three years…If there are others that have a 220v machine in America, have you had any issues with voltage converters? Have you had 220v lines ran in your home for it??

Other considerations:
- I am very much into coffee. This will not be a buy and let sit on my coffee bar scenario. I’ll be upgrading from a Barista Express.
- I wanted a lesser priced espresso machine but there aren’t many other options in Korea. La Marzocco has a strong presence here and servicing shouldn’t be a big issue.
- It’s going to be overkill for my normal use case but I’ll want the ability to pursue very light commercial use in the future.
- Currently have a Zerno Z1 grinder.

Eventually, she decided to focus on motherhood as us three kids had a lot of extra-curricular commitments (dance, soccer, etc). She was incredible at it and she was ALWAYS there for us.

But now, we’ve grown up - We all live separately and with our own partners. 

Over the last 5 - 10 years, my mum seems to have lost her purpose. She’s experiencing some health issues so couldn’t return to work. She is currently on anti-depressants and is very sedentary (she didn’t really workout ever, being a mum and chasing after kids was her exercise). She doesn’t cook her own meals (lives on coffee and açai bowls from the cafe downstairs from their apartment) and my dad does most of the cleaning, shopping, etc. 

Eventually I’ll be starting a family soon with my husband and I just KNOW that being a grandmother is so exciting for her and essentially is what will fill the void. But my child can’t be her hobby. I know they’ll want to help out and I want them too, but I also want her to have her own passions and thrills

What activities can I introduce her to and how can I help her to get involved with social activities? I think I’ll need to start these things with her as she’s very shy and has lost all her confidence.

Burps, I think I'm over coffee. Well, I'm over Nespresso coffee pods... for now, at least. Theyre meant to be raising their prices... again! Everything is going up, I get it. Remember Songbe... from JC. We chatted quite a bit, snd when he came to NYC for a visit, well, you may or may not remember this, but he dropped by the pastry shop (yrs ago, whilst I was still there) to see me!

With a simple offering... a 1 pound bag of whole bean Sumatra from Starbucks, one of my old favs back then. So I do keep a bag or two of their House Blend in the pantry, because it's soo good. Yeah, yeah, think what ya wanna.. it's gorg, at least to me it is. It really has to be, if it's gonna be their house blend, it better be good. Cafe Verona is also lovely. I remember being in my mid twenties, and working in a building near the Dakota. Just next door to the Dakota really, I had a patient there. Well, I can remember back then, selected Starbucks stores had that brewing technique where when you ordered a cup of Sumatra, they brewed it for you on the spot. Anyway, I can remember taking it outside and taking the first sip and thinking, wow, this is really special, this is like really, reeeally nice. Sigh, been hooked ever since. You know, there's something romantic about coffee, you must know these things!

I allso remember a restaurant called Josie's in the same neighborhood, just cross the street from the Dakota, and I used to order dinner there for delivery because I worked w this particular patient nights, so I would spent the night in her apartment. Anyway, they had this triple chocolate mousse torte. Which was to die for. 🤤 Anywsy, the last night on the job (she was getting better, I was on to the next patient thanks to the nursing agency I worked for) I walked into the restaurant and asked to purchase an entire cake. 🤸🏻‍♀️ To bring home, ya know.   I was so sad to learn years later that Josie's had closed down. Having shut down around August 2015 after 20 years in business. Sigh, nothing lasts forever..

Anywho, I was never a big apple pie person, but Pia brought an apple pie to Christmas dinner, and it was so gorg, I had to ask her for the recipe. So I'm going to share it with you... Here is the link: [https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12682/apple-pie-by-grandma-ople/Apple](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12682/apple-pie-by-grandma-ople/Apple) Pie by Grandma Ople

My own mom used to make apple pie, but it was horrible. Each time she made a pie, it was different. SOmetimes it was edible, sometimes... nerp. She didn't follow a recipe, she just winged it. Wung it? Ugh... terribles really. I remember she used cumin one time instead of cinnamon, gosh. That was really bad. Put me off apple pies ever since then, so when Pia brought the pie, I wasn't interested, till everyone at the dinner table raved about it.. So I'm going to make it. It was served w Haagen Daz vanilla ice cream, and I can't stop thinking about it.. it was sooo good. In remembrance of me mum, I shall become an apple pie maker.. Wish she was here to enjoy it. She would've looooved it. 🙄 😞",2,1767752702.0,ghostposter,1,1.0,False
1q6302f,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/1q6302f/how_to_avoid_cliches/,How to Avoid Cliches,"I've seen some of you abuse clichés, and you don't even know you're doing it. Worse, you're calling yourselves writers too. I'm here to help you understand why you need to avoid clichés, and what you need to do to avoid them.

First of all, look at the sub ""Brand New Sentence"" and just sort by top. What you're going to notice immediately is that a lot of these sentences are brand new, and because they are brand new, there is NOTHING you cannot write that is not brand new.

There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and **that can make up to 67,108,863 possible combinations of words,** and this is if the constraint is only 6 words. *(So what this means is there is always going to be a new way of saying something; the* ***English*** *language permits it.)* And if English permits it, and you're calling yourself a writer, you absolutely can do it.

**What is a Cliché?**

I love definitions; I love coming up with my own, but we're going to use Oxford here. *(You need to fall in love with definitions; if you haven't, stop writing and read the dictionary for a year) (I promise there* ***are*** *plenty of words you think you know* ***the meaning of,*** *but consider the fact that you most likely adopted them through context, not because you looked up the definition and learned EXACTLY how it was to be used.)*

A cliché is a phrase or opinion that is overused and betrays a lack of original thought.

This is a matter of my opinion. **But the majority of people are walking clichés.** They don't have their own phrases; they've picked those up from their favorite TV shows and movies *(do you know anyone who quotes The Office all the time? Hit that fool over the head with a hammer, btw. We've had enough).* **But their ENTIRE arsenal of words is locked to what they see on TV and the internet.**

**The majority of people's opinions are completely copy and pasted**. Most people are not taking long walks to think about stuff. Most people don't have the cognitive tools to filter the world as it comes in and wait and just be opinionless. **THEY MUST HAVE ONE.** *(This is most likely of a group they belong* ***to***\*; you will notice too, if you're someone in a group, you're sharing A LOT from that group: phrases, opinions, how you look, how to feel, the group is a reference point on how to be.)\*

**Antagonism towards A rtificial Intelligence is one of my more favorite clichés.**

Most of the folks have adopted opinions; most people don't even USE **a rtificial** intelligence. *(I was at a* ***Jack in the Box*** *and there was this elderly lady trying to use the ""self-checkout"" and she was becoming irate because she didn't know how to use it. She turned around and asked people for help; I just told her she could do it. And that I believed in her. She didn't think it was funny. But I didn't think her going ALL HER LIFE without learning the most basic of skills* ***was*** *funny* ***either.*** *I do not enable people. I've seen enough of that going around.)* Those people who've adopted their opinions about **a rtificial** intelligence are going to be the same frustrating people we have to deal with eventually, looking around at the world to solve their problems. Completely useless.

Personally, I don't think you can have an opinion on anything unless you've had frequent extended use. This is what is called experience. And experience, less or more, will always matter. Granted, there **are** going to be things that you've never experienced, and you want to write about. I would suggest **simulating** that experience as much as you humanly can. Or you're useless. **But, this is where the originality comes from. YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.** *(This could also be known as an angle, or perspective.)*

**Lo and behold, there is no one else like you on this planet.** And that is to say, there is nobody on this planet experiencing the world the way you're experiencing it. And you have all these words to take experience, and shape it into an image, for someone else to read and understand. And you can change the way they feel by choosing how you say something.

A cliché is not a way of saying something; **it's an automatic response aimed to fill in gaps so your brain doesn't think.**

Again, clichés are completely automated. That means you'll write it first and then see it later. So, how can we deal with some clichés? Well, let's get a single example going.

*""Think outside the box.""*

You might not have a character say this, but maybe you will. And maybe your character is not cliché; maybe he's the main character. Maybe he says things **differently**. In new ways. All the while, still MEANING **the same** thing.

*""Listen, you're so stuck inside the box I can see the shadows of the wall covering you. Why don't you step outside. Look around, and find something new, how about that? Then yes, we can go get coffee... ""*

Wordy, you bet. We live in times where brevity is doing more gutting than it is doing anything beneficial.

In this case, we've UNPACKED the cliché and made it more visual. This is the most important thing about clichés: **They are zip files.**

Do you know what a zip file is? It compresses data so you can open monstrous files without having to wait. It makes things so much more compact. What happens when you double click a zip file? You can double click clichés the same. And what you're going to unpack should be, actually, overwhelming. **Suppose** you did this when you noticed a cliché; **suppose** you could double click it. Well, you cannot double click clichés, can you?

...but, you can do something better and ask **""What does this mean?""**

**""What does this mean""** is a trusty shovel that can unpack your cliché, giving you worlds of meaning, and with all those combined with experience, a new way to say an old thing...

**While trying and failing to keep things brief,** are clichés ever okay?

No, never. Well, that's my **personal** philosophy. I've made exceptions for them, and that's the only reason why I think a cliché could ever fly. **It is** because you recognized it and had an argument for its existence. *(It's okay to fight for your writing; you should, based on the fact you have a solid argument..)*

In conclusion, this should make writing a little harder, but, because it's going to be harder, it's going to be better because of it. You'll take something dead floating around in your writing and bring new life to it, in such a way that has never been read, or even written before. But it's not easy.

I admit even **in** my own combing over (I like combing because of the visual) this post I cannot say for sure that I went without a single cliché other than my examples. But that is the challenge. And in time, you get better and better and better, and more importantly...

More original.

Edit: There was a warning here about my use of ""A I"" and ""A rtifical intelligence"" and because I'm using that terminology, and I have affirm that it's in reference to, it's not the topic. **It's my absolute favorite, modern, ongoing reference.**

I have to add too I think it's completely fucking bonkers the mods have ""automated"" what people can say and not say about A I, how funny is that...

Rating: 7.5/10
""Honestly a solid piece for winter. I dig the reversible feature—the fleece side looks cozy, but the nylon side in this pic looks a bit deflated and wrinkly. Might need a steam or some wear to puff it up properly. The Coyote/Brown colorway is versatile, but the zipper hardware looks a little flimsy in the photo. Good daily driver, but nothing mind-blowing.""

2. The North Face Nuptse (Black)
**Rating: 8/10**
""You can't really go wrong with a black Nuptse, it’s a staple for a reason. That said, it is the 'NPC uniform' of winter. The puffiness here looks decent, not too flat. My main gripe with these is usually the collar shape—sometimes it sits weirdly against the neck. If the down fill is good, it’s a keep, but don't expect to stand out in a crowd.""

3. Ami Paris Big Heart Sweater
**Rating: 6/10**
""Unpopular opinion maybe, but the massive Ami de Coeur logo is getting a bit played out. It screams 'I bought this for the logo.' The grey knit looks clean and the stitching on the 'A' seems tight, but I’m worried about the wool quality. These tend to pill super fast or feel itchy if the material blend is cheap. Clean look, just a bit basic.""

4. Purple Brand Denim Jacket
**Rating: 5.5/10**
""This is... a lot. The paint splatter and distress effect feels a bit forced and artificial in this lighting. It gives off strong 2016 hypebeast vibes. If you style it with plain black pants it might work, but it’s a loud piece. The fit on Purple Brand is usually tight/fitted, so if you prefer the boxy/baggy trend, you might hate how this sits.""

5. Gallery Dept. Long Sleeve Tee
Rating: 7/10**
""Clean graphic. The 'Bar Dé Music' print is one of their better, more low-key designs. The blank looks decent, maybe a bit thin? The cuffs look like they might lose elasticity quickly. It’s a cool layering piece, but for what it is (literally a cotton long sleeve), it’s nothing crazy. Good for a chill fit.""

6. Acne Studios 'Mud Wash' / Chain Print Jeans
Rating: 9/10**
""Best item in the haul, hands down. The wash and the trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) chain print are sick. It fits that grimey/grunge aesthetic perfectly. My only concern is styling—these are hard to pull off without looking like you literally rolled in dirt. If you have the right boots and cropped top/hoodie, these are fire. If not, they just look messy.""

7. Corteiz Velvet Track Jacket**
Rating: 7/10
""The velvet texture looks plush, definitely a comfy piece. Corteiz is huge right now, so the hype is there. However, black velvet is a lint magnet. You are going to be using a lint roller every time you leave the house. Also, the elastic banding at the hem looks a little loose/cheap. Good for a cozy UK drip vibe, but high maintenance.""

8. Off-White 'Out of Office' (OOO) Sneakers
Rating: 8.5/10**
""Super clean colorway. The white and grey is way more wearable than the loud colors Off-White usually does. The leather cuts look smooth and the shape is correct (chunky but not clown shoes). Just be warned, these are heavy on foot. If you plan on walking all day in these, your feet might get tired. Solid pickup.""

9. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Taupe)
Rating: 9.5/10**
""Certified classic. You literally cannot hate on these. The suede looks buttery and the color is perfect for neutral tones. They go with sweatpants, jeans, shorts, whatever. The only downside is keeping that suede clean—one drop of coffee or rain and it's game over. Make sure you spray them with protector immediately.""

10. Purple Brand Distressed Jeans (Black)
Rating: 5/10
""Meh. Similar to the jacket, the distressing here looks kinda cheap, specifically the checkered patches peeking through. It feels very 'mall fashion.' The skinny/stacked fit is also kind of dying out in favor of baggy denim. If you're going for a rockstar look, they work, but otherwise, I’d pass on these for something with a better wash.""

11. Fear of God Essentials 1/2 Zip Pullover (Nylon)
Rating: 7/10
""This is way better than their standard cotton hoodies that everyone and their grandma wears. The nylon gives it a nice technical/sporty vibe while keeping that signature boxy FOG silhouette. My only issue with these is the material noise—you literally sound like a walking bag of chips when you move. Also, the elastic on the waist looks really aggressive; expect it to ride up constantly if you don't layer it right.""

12. 'Lucky Me I See Ghosts' Hoodie (Kids See Ghosts)**
Rating: 6.5/10
""Ah, the holy grail of 2018 hypebeasts. Honestly, this piece feels a bit dated now. The puff print on the text looks decent—it’s got that 3D texture you want—but be careful washing it because that puff *will* crack and peel eventually. The wash on the grey fabric looks okay, maybe a bit too dark compared to retail, but it's hard to tell without natural light. Cool for the nostalgia, but a bit loud for 2026.""

13. Ralph Lauren Pony Socks (3-Pack)
Rating: 8/10
""Not much to say here, they are socks. You're paying for the little horse embroidery, let's be real. They are definitely cleaner than standard Nike socks for wearing with loafers or low-top sneakers like the OOOs or Birkenstocks you posted earlier. They tend to pill after a few washes though, so enjoy the crisp white look while it lasts. Solid essential.""

14. Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Sweater (Cream)**
Rating: 8.5/10
""This is the 'Old Money' starter pack final boss. It’s a super safe, versatile piece that makes you look put-together instantly. The cable knitting gives it good texture so it doesn't look cheap. It pairs perfectly with the fatigue pants or denim from your previous haul. Just make sure it’s not too thin; some of the newer RL knits feel flimsy. If the weight is good, this is a wardrobe staple.""

Pero I have a solid circle of friends during that time, I still remember na mas marami parin ang fun moments noon kesa sa cringe moments. I also apologized wholeheartedly after graduation to those na binully ko noon.

I'm 27 now and a had alot of growth. My Confidence is Well Built, Physique is Solid, Career is Booming. Basically wala akong anything to be ashamed of or to be a source of Insecurity.

I made a post a while back asking if anyone was interested in a web design workshop. On **February 11th, 2026** (a holiday) from **12pm-3pm**, I will be holding a **beginner-friendly web design workshop at CAFE LA**. The workshop is **FREE**. You will not be giving me any money, so just come! However, it is encouraged that you support CAFE LA. You will get a **free drink on the house**! If you love the cafe as much as I do, be sure to come back ♥️ CAFE LA has a lot of yummy options, you can [check the location here on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PfwsD9wjz6hmES1u6).

If you are looking to learn more about web design as a beginner or maybe you are already a developer but want to understand a bit more? Please come through! I am confident that this will be a great introduction to you. All you need to do is bring your body and your laptop.

The maximum seating will be about 10-12, so [please RSVP at the google form here](https://forms.gle/L4BtSg6PgRh4FN9F9). Get here and grab a comfy seat!! This first workshop will focus on creating a wireframe and using the free program called [Figma](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) (so **download it before coming!**) It will be hands-on, so it would be nice if you could make it on time as I will be going through the motions.

I'm looking forward to seeing you there. I want to find more likeminded people in Osaka, so I am taking a chance to reach out and put together an accessible activity. This design that we create together can eventually become a portfolio piece if you are looking to expand your skillset and pursue some different type of work. I am hoping that this experience can be valuable for people who may feel hesitant but want to finally take a step in learning something new (and meeting new people!) this year.

If you have any questions, let me know! I will see you on **February 11th**!

**Edit:** \*The work shop is conducted in English, but I highly suggest you join even if you are not fluent\*

1q62qm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1q62qm7/which_camping_cookware_set_handles_highaltitude/,Which camping cookware set handles high-altitude cooking?,"When you're planning a high-altitude camping trip, your regular camping cookware set might not cut it. At elevations above 8,000 feet, water boils at lower temperatures and food takes longer to cook. This means you need gear that can handle these unique challenges.

**What Makes High-Altitude Cooking Different**

At higher elevations, the air pressure drops. This makes water boil around 198°F instead of the usual 212°F at sea level. Your pasta will take longer to cook, and your morning coffee might taste weak. That's why choosing the right outdoor cooking gear matters so much.

**Key Features to Look For**

The best camping cookware for high altitudes should have thick, heavy bottoms that distribute heat evenly. Aluminum and stainless steel are your best friends here. They conduct heat well and won't warp under pressure.

Look for pots with tight-fitting lids. These help trap heat and moisture, which is crucial when cooking takes longer. Non-stick surfaces are also helpful since food tends to stick more at altitude.

**Essential Pieces for Your Kit**

A good high-altitude camping cookware set should include a large pot for boiling water, a medium saucepan, and a frying pan. Many backpacking cookware sets come with these basics, but make sure they're built tough enough for mountain conditions.

Pressure cookers work great at altitude too. They can cut your cooking time in half, which saves fuel and gets you fed faster after a long day on the trail.

**Material Matters**

Titanium cookware is lightweight but expensive. It heats unevenly, which can be a problem when you're already dealing with altitude cooking challenges. Aluminum heats evenly and costs less. Stainless steel lasts forever but weighs more.

Hard-anodized aluminum gives you the best of both worlds - even heating and durability without too much weight.

**Size and Weight Considerations**

For solo camping or backpacking, compact cookware sets work well. But if you're car camping with a group, you'll want larger pots and pans. Think about how many people you're feeding and how much space you have in your pack or vehicle.

**Pro Tips for High-Altitude Success**

Use more liquid when cooking rice or pasta. The lower boiling temperature means you'll need extra water. Add about 25% more liquid than the recipe calls for.

Bring a windscreen for your camping stove. Wind is often stronger at high elevations, and it can make cooking even harder.

**Making the Right Choice**

When shopping for mountain cooking equipment, read reviews from other campers who've used the gear at altitude. Check if the [camping cookware set](https://athomewave.com/camping-cookware-set) includes all the pieces you need, or if you'll have to buy extras separately.

Remember that the cheapest option isn't always the best. Invest in quality pieces that won't let you down when you're miles from the nearest kitchen. A reliable [camping cookware set](https://athomewave.com/camping-cookware-set) can make the difference between a great trip and a hungry one.

The right cookware will serve you well on many adventures. Choose pieces that fit your cooking style, group size, and the type of camping you do most often. With the right gear, you'll be making delicious meals at any elevation.",1,1767752004.0,productplace,0,1.0,False

I'm hoping someone out there can provide suggestions on what could possibly be wrong with me. I'm a 33 y/o male and about two months ago I began having awful GI issues: bloating, stomach cramps, and loose stools (sometimes bordering on incontinence) especially after just eating. I've always had a sensitive stomach for as long as I can remember and cut out dairy a long time ago as well as coffee. It had been working fine but I never experienced anything like what began about 2 months ago. Decided to seek out a GI and they ordered stool samples (all negative) and a colonoscopy (this came back with inflamed lower bowel). Also negative for Celiac's.

I'm currently taking the following meds: 
Sertraline 
Truvada 
Bromocriptine (I have a prolactinoma)

My GI thinks there's a link between the sertraline and the inflammation and wants to rule that out before further imaging. 
I had been on sertraline since before these symptoms started (as well as other SSRIs and SNRIs for a long time, almost 20 years). 
I had recently started Truvada again after using Descovy for a bit, but had never experienced this the last time I was on truvada five years ago.

This has been going on for weeks and i have no idea what to do. Anytime i eat or drink anything with any slight acidity my tongue is on fire.

I will say that I was sick on and off for about a month right before this happened - I got the flu which lingered forever, then a cold sore popped up on my face, and then I got another cold.

I see people thriving on low doses, and have gotten a bit concerned with my ever increasing amounts. I apologise in advance for the wall of text - I'm trying to provide every piece of info I can.


I was diagnosed ADHD Combined in October (mid 30's Male if it matters). I was advised bordering on severe levels, if that matters.


Additional info that may be relevant. Or not.
> made sure meds are always <25°c
> I'm overweight, but have been consistently losing weight (prior to starting meds, not because of)
> protein intake is adequate, having protein with or before
> don't eat over 10g carbs per day
> abstain from alcohol usually, exception of some drinks over Christmas (like 2/day, not to excess)
> whilst I've been diagnosed, the other 3 people in my household have not - I have the same results whether they are around or not (can't say they're fuelling the fire deal)


I was prescribed Dexamfetamine from the get go at their suggestion (most success etc). 


I started on the usual 2.5mg x 3 times a day. No real response other than I had to drop coffee after than they suggested.


Moved up slowly (per titration schedule) to 5mg x 3, then 10mg x 3 times a day. 


This did help, noted very minor improvements, but at my last review, the psychiatrist advised that my dosage did not meet ""expected therapeutic response"" of the correct amount.


They advised that some people require more than others, and that while it was heading in the right direction and my body was tolerating it, we would increase.


I was given a new schedule of up to 45mg a day, but was given control of how to do that, as long as I did it slowly. I have also kept regular blood pressure records at their request.


I began 12.5mg x 3 times a day, no noticeable improvement. 15mg x 3, again no measurable improvement. 


I have also tried staggering per their suggestion so 15mg/20mg/10mg, 10mg/25mg/10mg, 5/30/10 etc.
 - my dose times are 6.30am, 10.30am, 2.30pm


Other things I have tried;
> 3 hour doses - way worse by the end of day, back to heavy coffee usage in evening 
> L-theanine - 450mg with morning dose, didn't note any improvement and not sure worth the $$ every month
> Creatine - marginal improvement at 0.1g/kg bodyweight, ineffective 3g suggested dose. 


Finally - my family is visiting inlaws for a week so I got approval to work from home and try a few different staggerings. 


This morning I front loaded 25mg at 6.30am with L-theanine, then had 15mg at 10.30am - this leaves me with 5mg to have later, but even at 25mg I'm still struggling to focus etc. Like here I am on reddit searching though posts, then making my own instead of you know, actually working.


How does one know they're even close to the ""expected therapeutic response""? 


What the hell does that even look like?


Are high doses common?


At what point do I need to try something else?


If you've made it to the end, I appreciate you taking the time to do so whether you reply or not.


I don't want to go back to raw-dogging life even if medication turns out to not be asbeffective as hoped - I talk about minor improvements, but the biggest improvement has been with my tolerance (for want of a better word) with my young kids. This in itself is worth all the bullshit and money spent to get here. If this is as good as it gets, I'll cop it on the chin.

Rating: 7.5/10
""Honestly a solid piece for winter. I dig the reversible feature—the fleece side looks cozy, but the nylon side in this pic looks a bit deflated and wrinkly. Might need a steam or some wear to puff it up properly. The Coyote/Brown colorway is versatile, but the zipper hardware looks a little flimsy in the photo. Good daily driver, but nothing mind-blowing.""

2. The North Face Nuptse (Black)
**Rating: 8/10**
""You can't really go wrong with a black Nuptse, it’s a staple for a reason. That said, it is the 'NPC uniform' of winter. The puffiness here looks decent, not too flat. My main gripe with these is usually the collar shape—sometimes it sits weirdly against the neck. If the down fill is good, it’s a keep, but don't expect to stand out in a crowd.""

3. Ami Paris Big Heart Sweater
**Rating: 6/10**
""Unpopular opinion maybe, but the massive Ami de Coeur logo is getting a bit played out. It screams 'I bought this for the logo.' The grey knit looks clean and the stitching on the 'A' seems tight, but I’m worried about the wool quality. These tend to pill super fast or feel itchy if the material blend is cheap. Clean look, just a bit basic.""

4. Purple Brand Denim Jacket
**Rating: 5.5/10**
""This is... a lot. The paint splatter and distress effect feels a bit forced and artificial in this lighting. It gives off strong 2016 hypebeast vibes. If you style it with plain black pants it might work, but it’s a loud piece. The fit on Purple Brand is usually tight/fitted, so if you prefer the boxy/baggy trend, you might hate how this sits.""

5. Gallery Dept. Long Sleeve Tee
Rating: 7/10**
""Clean graphic. The 'Bar Dé Music' print is one of their better, more low-key designs. The blank looks decent, maybe a bit thin? The cuffs look like they might lose elasticity quickly. It’s a cool layering piece, but for what it is (literally a cotton long sleeve), it’s nothing crazy. Good for a chill fit.""

6. Acne Studios 'Mud Wash' / Chain Print Jeans

""Best item in the haul, hands down. The wash and the trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) chain print are sick. It fits that grimey/grunge aesthetic perfectly. My only concern is styling—these are hard to pull off without looking like you literally rolled in dirt. If you have the right boots and cropped top/hoodie, these are fire. If not, they just look messy.""

7. Corteiz Velvet Track Jacket**
Rating: 7/10
""The velvet texture looks plush, definitely a comfy piece. Corteiz is huge right now, so the hype is there. However, black velvet is a lint magnet. You are going to be using a lint roller every time you leave the house. Also, the elastic banding at the hem looks a little loose/cheap. Good for a cozy UK drip vibe, but high maintenance.""

8. Off-White 'Out of Office' (OOO) Sneakers
Rating: 8.5/10**
""Super clean colorway. The white and grey is way more wearable than the loud colors Off-White usually does. The leather cuts look smooth and the shape is correct (chunky but not clown shoes). Just be warned, these are heavy on foot. If you plan on walking all day in these, your feet might get tired. Solid pickup.""

9. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Taupe)
Rating: 9.5/10**
""Certified classic. You literally cannot hate on these. The suede looks buttery and the color is perfect for neutral tones. They go with sweatpants, jeans, shorts, whatever. The only downside is keeping that suede clean—one drop of coffee or rain and it's game over. Make sure you spray them with protector immediately.""

10. Purple Brand Distressed Jeans (Black)
Rating: 5/10
""Meh. Similar to the jacket, the distressing here looks kinda cheap, specifically the checkered patches peeking through. It feels very 'mall fashion.' The skinny/stacked fit is also kind of dying out in favor of baggy denim. If you're going for a rockstar look, they work, but otherwise, I’d pass on these for something with a better wash.""

11. Fear of God Essentials 1/2 Zip Pullover (Nylon)
Rating: 7/10
""This is way better than their standard cotton hoodies that everyone and their grandma wears. The nylon gives it a nice technical/sporty vibe while keeping that signature boxy FOG silhouette. My only issue with these is the material noise—you literally sound like a walking bag of chips when you move. Also, the elastic on the waist looks really aggressive; expect it to ride up constantly if you don't layer it right.""

12. 'Lucky Me I See Ghosts' Hoodie (Kids See Ghosts)**
Rating: 6.5/10
""Ah, the holy grail of 2018 hypebeasts. Honestly, this piece feels a bit dated now. The puff print on the text looks decent—it’s got that 3D texture you want—but be careful washing it because that puff *will* crack and peel eventually. The wash on the grey fabric looks okay, maybe a bit too dark compared to retail, but it's hard to tell without natural light. Cool for the nostalgia, but a bit loud for 2026.""

13. Ralph Lauren Pony Socks (3-Pack)
Rating: 8/10
""Not much to say here, they are socks. You're paying for the little horse embroidery, let's be real. They are definitely cleaner than standard Nike socks for wearing with loafers or low-top sneakers like the OOOs or Birkenstocks you posted earlier. They tend to pill after a few washes though, so enjoy the crisp white look while it lasts. Solid essential.""

14. Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Sweater (Cream)**
Rating: 8.5/10
""This is the 'Old Money' starter pack final boss. It’s a super safe, versatile piece that makes you look put-together instantly. The cable knitting gives it good texture so it doesn't look cheap. It pairs perfectly with the fatigue pants or denim from your previous haul. Just make sure it’s not too thin; some of the newer RL knits feel flimsy. If the weight is good, this is a wardrobe staple.""

\-6A-

I don’t think I have much time left, so I’m going to try and get this all out before there’s nothing left of me that remembers how.

If this sounds dramatic, I’m sorry. I know how it sounds. I know how that title looks and if I’d read something like this a month ago, I would’ve, just like you, justifiably, rolled my eyes, assumed it was some attempt at creepy internet fiction, and moved on.

But I don’t think I exist anywhere else anymore. Not really. And if I don’t write this down now, I’m afraid the only place I’ll exist at all is inside these walls.

My name doesn’t matter. Even if I gave it, I’m not sure anyone who used to know me would recognize it. Or remember. Or care. 

A month ago, I was living with someone I loved. I’d moved across the state for her. New city, new job, new everything. I left what little family I had and the handful of friends I trusted because I thought, stupidly, that this was my chance at a real life. A shared one.

We’d been together three years. We’d had fights, sure. But I thought that was normal. I thought we’d do the messy, difficult thing and come out the other side stronger. I thought we’d have kids one day. I thought I had time.

Turns out I didn’t.

One morning, she woke up quiet. Too quiet. She wouldn’t meet my eyes. She sat on the edge of the bed, hands twisted in the sheets, and told me she “needed space.” It was the kind of phrase that doesn’t sound real when it lands. Like something from a show you don’t watch closely.

By that evening the space she needed was the entire apartment, and I was the thing that didn’t belong in it.

It wasn’t a screaming match. She was calm, almost gentle. That somehow made it worse. She had clearly been living with this decision long before I knew it existed. To her, it was already over. To me, it ended in a single day.

I didn’t have family to run to. I’d burned too many bridges trying to keep my head above water for the last few years to have anyone I could crash with. The job I’d moved here for barely covered my half of the rent we used to split. Alone, it was impossible.

So there I was: one suitcase, a backpack, half a charge on my phone, and nowhere to go that night except out.

It’s funny how quickly your life shrinks down to immediate needs. You stop thinking about goals or dreams or five year plans. Everything becomes: 

“Where am I going to sleep?” 

“What can I eat that doesn’t cost anything?” 

“How long before she changes the locks?”

I sat in a cheap diner nursing a coffee I couldn’t afford, scrolling rental listings like I was looking through the obituaries. Everything was too expensive, too far, too “must have three times monthly income” for someone who’d just watched their life implode.

Then I found it.

“Studio apartment. $350/month. Immediate move-in. No deposit. No credit check. No questions.”

If that sets off alarm bells for you, congratulations, you’re doing better than I was.

At the time it felt like a hand reaching down into a pit and grabbing me by the collar. I didn’t think about why it was so cheap. I didn’t think about why there were no photos of the inside. I didn’t think about why the listing said “vacant long-term” in small gray letters at the bottom.

I just saw the word “immediate.”

I called. A man picked up on the second ring, like he’d been sitting there waiting.

“Yeah,” he said, after I asked if the unit was really available. “You can come by today if you want.”

There was no application. No awkward tour. He met me in the lobby, slid a clipboard across a dusty little table, and pointed to a spot to sign. His eyes looked tired in a way that made me feel guilty for existing.

“Place has been empty a while,” he said, handing me the key. “People like newer buildings these days.”

It didn’t sound convincing then. It sounds even less convincing now.

The first time I walked into the apartment, it felt…unremarkable. That’s the best way I can put it. Old beige walls, scuffed floorboards, a kitchen that had seen better decades. The air had that stale, faintly sour smell of a place that had been closed up too long.

But it was quiet. 

It was mine. 

For the first time since that morning, I closed a door and no one was on the other side waiting to tell me to leave.

I slept on the floor that night, my rolled up hoodie as a pillow, my suitcase as a nightstand. I cried a little. Not in the loud, cinematic way. Just that dry, exhausted crying where your face crumples and your body shakes but nothing much comes out.

I told myself it would be okay. I had a place. A starting point. I could rebuild from here.

I really believed that.

The next morning, I found my wallet in the freezer.

I stared at it for a full minute before touching it, like it might be some kind of trap. Frost had collected around the leather. My cards were stiff inside. I had no memory of putting it there.

My brain tried to make sense of it.

You were exhausted.

You’re grieving.

You were half asleep.

You probably put it there without thinking.

It wasn’t like it levitated inside the fridge overnight. If anyone had moved it, it had to be me. There was no one else.

So I forced myself to laugh, a thin, hollow sound that bounced off the cabinets and died.

“Nice one,” I muttered to myself. “You’re really nailing this ‘new start’ thing.”

I decided to be more careful. To pay attention when I put things down. To stop drifting around in that numb haze where everything feels like it’s happening in a dream.

It didn’t matter.

The next day, the bathroom door handle felt…wrong.

It was just a little thing. The knob seemed a few inches closer to the hall than I remembered. I measured it with my hand, palm to frame, like that would prove anything. I told myself I was used to the layout of my old place, the one I’d shared with her. Muscle memory. That was all.

But once you start doubting your perception, it spreads. It’s like a crack in glass. Small at first, then branching out like a spiderweb covering everything.

On the third morning, I woke up to find my suitcase fully unpacked.

Every shirt folded and placed in drawers. Jeans hung neatly in the closet. Toiletries lined up on the bathroom sink. Even my socks were paired, which is something I rarely bothered with even on good days.

I sat on the edge of the mattress I’d dragged in and tried to remember doing it. Maybe last night? Maybe I’d finally snapped out of it and done something productive and my brain had just…erased the effort?

But I couldn’t place the feeling. No vague flash of folding, no sense of “oh, right.” Just a blank.

“Okay,” I whispered. “You’re tired. You’re sad. That’s all. People forget things all the time.”

I started leaving my phone’s voice recorder on when I went to sleep, just to prove to myself I wasn’t doing things and forgetting them. That’s how far it got, that early. Me, arguing with empty air and my own reflection like I could win.

The first time I played one of those recordings back, it was just eight hours of soft breathing, occasional shifts of the mattress, and the distant hum of pipes in the walls.

No footsteps.

No sounds of drawers opening.

No rustling of clothes.

But when I checked the apartment again, the couch had moved six inches to the left.

It was around then that I found the first note.

I only saw it because I dropped a razor behind the toilet and had to bend down and shove my hand behind the tank to fish it out. The porcelain on the back of the tank was dusty, except for a finger wiped line where someone had placed a folded scrap of lined paper.

I unfolded it with wet hands, trying not to smear the ink.

‘Stop sleeping if you want to stay you’

That’s all it said.

No name. No date. The handwriting was jagged, like it had been written in a hurry or with shaking hands.

I laughed when I read it, but it stuck in my head like a splinter. Every time my eyes drifted shut after that, I saw those words.

Still, people leave weird shit behind. It didn’t have to mean anything. Maybe some teenager wrote it to freak out a roommate. Maybe it was some kind of edgy inside joke. Apartment graffiti.

That’s what I thought, until I found the second one.

It was under the fridge. I only noticed it because something kept rattling every time I walked past, a thin bump, bump, bump, like a trapped insect. When I pulled the fridge forward, a folded note slid out and fluttered onto my sock.

The dust underneath looked undisturbed, like nothing had been moved in years.

The note itself, like the other, had one line written in the same hastily inked font. 

‘The doors move when you do’

I didn’t laugh at that one.

After that, I started looking. I tore through the kitchen cabinets, checked under drawer liners, ran my fingers along the undersides of shelves. The apartment didn’t make me work hard.

In the cabinet above the sink, on the back panel, someone had written a phrase in faint pencil. 

‘It rearranges us first’

The word “us” landed in my gut like a stone.

I stared at that sentence so long my eyes burned. The light in the kitchen buzzed and flickered above me. Outside the small window, I could hear the muffled sounds of traffic, people talking, normal city noise. Life continuing in straight lines while mine curled in on itself inside my cramped studio.

I told myself that if someone had gone through the effort of hiding notes like that, they were probably not in a good place mentally. That didn’t mean they were right. It just meant they were scared.

The problem was, I was scared too.

From then on, the changes came quicker.

I’d walk from the kitchen to the bathroom and notice that the hallway felt two steps longer. Not a lot. Just enough that my body registered the difference a split second before my brain caught up. Like a song played at the wrong speed.

The bathroom mirror seemed slightly taller one morning. The towel rack a few inches lower. The light switch on the opposite side of the frame. I stood there with my hand in the air, fingers groping for a switch that wasn’t there anymore.

“You’re thinking of the old place,” I muttered. “Her place. Stop doing that. It’s not the same layout.”

But my pulse was pounding so hard my vision trembled.

Objects moved too. Not just my wallet and toothbrush. Bigger things. The mattress shifted closer to the window. The kitchen table edged toward the door. Once, I woke up with my head at the foot of the bed and my shoes lined up neatly beside my face on the floor, toes pointing inward like they had been watching me sleep.

I stopped sleeping well. I’d jolt awake multiple times a night with the sick feeling that someone had just stepped out of the room. My dreams, when I had them, were of hallways that never ended and doors that opened into copies of the same room over and over.

I became hyperaware of the walls. Of the way sound moved through them. Of tiny, almost imperceptible creaks that seemed to answer my breathing. I’d hold my breath and swear I could hear the apartment exhale.

On Day 9, if you can call them days, when you barely sleep time feels like chewing gum, I noticed the vent cover in the main room was slightly crooked.

It hadn’t been crooked before. I was sure of that. The screws on the bottom right corner were pulled out a bit, exposing a thin slice of darkness.

I don’t know why I dragged a chair over and stood on it. Some part of me already knew nothing good comes out of opening hidden spaces in horror stories. But this wasn’t supposed to be a horror story. It was supposed to be my life.

Behind the vent was a shoebox pressed tight into the duct. It took a stupid amount of yanking and swearing to pull it free, dust cascading down onto my face.

Inside were photos.

Some old, some newer. Different sizes, different types of paper. All of them had been taken in this apartment.

An older man sitting on the edge of the bed, staring toward the door with wide, hollow eyes.

A woman crouched in the corner of the kitchen, her hands clamped over her ears, mouth open in a sound the photograph couldn’t capture.

A kid, maybe eight years old, standing in the bathroom doorway, half of his body blurred like he’d been moving as the picture developed.

And one Polaroid with a date scribbled on the white border. ‘Six years ago.’ A man stands in the middle of the main room, shoulders slumped, looking past the camera. He looks tired in a way that made my chest hurt.

Behind him, the apartment looks…wrong.

The hallway is longer than it is now. Or maybe narrower. The perspective feels off, like one of those optical illusions where lines bend where they shouldn’t. The walls seem to tilt inward. The door to the bathroom is where my kitchen window should be.

I put the lid back on the box and shoved it away from me like it might bite.

It didn’t occur to me right away that, if those photos were here, those people weren’t.

Not until I found the tapes.

They were in the coat closet. I found them when my jacket sleeve caught on a nail and when I yanked the sleeve away to hard it pulled back a slice of drywall just enough to reveal the edge of a plastic case. Behind the loose panel was a narrow cavity full of junk, old receipts, a cracked phone, socks with no pair.

And a small camcorder, battery compartment crusted with age.

I found a charger at a pawn shop two blocks away. I almost didn’t go. A very, very rational part of me wanted to throw the camera out and move on. But curiosity does the same thing desperation does. It makes you ignore warning signs.

The battery took a charge. Against my better judgment, I hit play on the first file.

The screen lit up with the same walls I was sitting between.

The man from the Polaroid sat on the floor, back against the bathroom door, hair sticking out in sweaty clumps. His voice shook when he spoke.

“If anyone finds this,” he said, “don’t…don’t move in here. It learns you. I know that sounds crazy. I thought it was me at first. Stress. Drinking. Whatever. I thought I was just losing it.”

He laughed, a frayed sound, eyes darting around like he expected the apartment to interrupt him.

“It moves things. Just little things, at first. You’ll think you’re doing it. That’s how it gets you. It makes you doubt yourself. Then it starts changing the rooms. The doors don’t stay put. You wake up and the hallway is longer, or the bathroom’s on the wrong side. You try to leave and end up back where you started. It…”

The video glitched. Lines of static crawled down the screen.

When the image stabilized, he was closer. Sitting where I was sitting now. He looked straight into the camera.

“Once it knows you,” he whispered, “it keeps you.”

The footage cut off.

I sat there for a long time after the screen went black, listening to the soft wheeze of the camcorder and the thud of my heart. My reflection in the darkened TV looked pale and stretched.

The thing about hearing someone else describe your nightmare is that it doesn’t make it less real. It just means someone else was awake before you.

After that, everything got worse.

Sometimes I’d walk to the front door and there’d be a little extra space between it and the wall. Sometimes less. Once, I reached for the knob and my hand closed on empty air. No door. Just unbroken wall where it should’ve been. I blinked, and it was back.

The cheap ceiling light in the main room seemed higher each day. The kitchen felt narrower, forcing my shoulders inward as I moved. The bathroom mirror showed more wall behind me than there should have been.

I’d put my keys on the counter and turn around to find them on the floor. I’d swear I’d left the faucet off and hear water running anyway. I’d find food in the fridge I didn’t remember buying, half a jar of pickles, a slice of birthday cake in a plastic container, a Chinese takeout box with someone else’s handwriting on it.

The handwriting that started showing up in the margins of my own notebooks.

Sometimes it looked like mine. Sometimes like someone else’s. Sometimes like it was trying to be mine and not quite getting there.

Little notes, in the corners.

‘It remembers where you stood’ 

‘Stop trying to leave’ 

‘It’s been longer than you think’

I started having gaps in my memory. Not small, forget-where-you-put-your-keys gaps. Whole evenings gone. I’d look up and realize the light had changed, and I didn’t know what I’d done in the hours between.

Once, I came to standing in the bathroom, my hands pressed flat against the mirror. Written across the glass in soap, in my handwriting, were the words:

‘You’re apart of the layout now’

I wiped it away so fast I cut my knuckle on the edge of the frame.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here now. The days stopped lining up after a while. My phone’s clock keeps glitching, resetting to strange times. Sometimes the date jumps backward. Once it showed a year that hasn’t happened yet.

Calls don’t go through. Texts sit in “sending” limbo until I receive the ‘failed to send’ message or they vanish completely. The few people I managed to contact early on either didn’t respond or sent one word replies that didn’t sound like them.

Did I actually call them? Did I dream it? Did I imagine their voices? It’s getting harder to separate what I know from what the apartment wants me to think.

I’ve found other things, too. An envelope wedged under a floorboard, full of expired IDs from people I’ve never met. A ring at the back of a kitchen drawer. A pair of glasses on top of the cabinet so dusty they must have sat there for years.

None of it is mine. All of it is in my home.

Sometimes, late at night, when I sit very still and force myself not to cry, I swear I can feel the apartment thinking. Not with a mind, exactly. With intention.

The walls feel too close. The corners feel like they’re folding inward. The air tastes stale, dead, like it’s been exhaled too many times.

I keep catching myself doing things I don’t remember deciding to do. Rearranging the table. Moving the mattress. Closing doors I don’t remember opening. Once, I woke up with dust under my fingernails and the vent cover on the floor. The shoebox was back inside the duct, as if I had carefully put it there.

I don’t remember doing that. But the box didn’t walk back on its own.

That’s what scares me the most now. Not that the apartment is changing, but that it’s making me part of the process. Like I’m one more component it’s rearranging. One more piece of furniture it’s finding a place for.

When I listen very hard, I feel like I can hear echoes behind the plaster. Not voices, exactly. Just the sense of others. People who stood where I’m standing. People who thought they were getting a second chance with cheap rent and no questions. People who left notes and tapes and warnings that no one came in time to read.

I don’t think anyone came for them. I don’t think anyone remembered they were here once the apartment finished with them.

I can feel it finishing with me.

My thoughts are getting thinner. Sometimes I reread what I just wrote and it feels like someone else’s story. Sometimes I catch my reflection out of the corner of my eye and don’t recognize myself. For a split second, I see someone older. Or younger. Or someone who isn’t me at all.

I don’t know how this is going to end for me. I don’t know if there’ll be a body for anyone to find. I don’t know if the landlord really knows what this place does or if he just sees tenants go in and lists go back up when they “move out.”

All I know is that the apartment doesn’t like emptiness. It fills itself. With belongings. With memories. With people who think they have nowhere else to go.

If you’re reading this, and any of it sounds familiar, if you’ve ever walked into a too-cheap, too-empty place and felt it watching you back, please listen.

Don’t come looking for me.

Don’t try to find this building.

Don’t answer any listing that sounds like mine.

And if you ever see a studio advertised as “vacant long-term, immediate move in, no questions asked” for far less than it should cost…

don’t move in.

The apartment I’m in is empty again.

And it’s waiting.

Wanting.

“In the end, the tenant of 6A drifts into the fabric of the apartment, another life quietly absorbed by walls that remember far too much. Nothing in 6A ends with a scream or a struggle, only a slow, gentle, disappearance, until you realize how completely the room has claimed what’s left. The ledger closes softly on another missing tenant as the building settles around the loss of 6A.”

I work with a nice ESL teacher at work. When I first met him in the fall, I found him quite tall, handsome, polished and classy. He is always very polite, engaging, well dressed. He looks like John Slattery from Mad Men or  silver fox Colin Firth. I look like a petite Kim K type. He must be about 55 and I am 45. 

Today, I visited the school on a different day. I was wearing a maroon tunic and tall boots - guy teachers always act very nice to me when I wear this outfit, chat more with me or smirk when I pull a kid from their class. I said hello. He looked over, held my gaze and smiled. Every time, I passed thru the office, he made eye contact and smiled. Like 4-5 x before I saw my 2 other students. The door to the office was open. I chatted with him about working with students with language difficulties. 

  He had no ring. We chatted about how long weve worked in the field, what schools.we covered..I.mentioned that I covered this school because I live in neighborhoood _____. He mentioned that he lived in my neighborhood (a street right beside mine) and mentioned that he had a dog. I mentioned i had a golden retriever.  He said ""I rented a house in the neighborhood. Then I moved to a condo at _____"" I bought my current house on ___ Street 10 years ago. He mentioned I and my (not we, our, my wife and I). Is he just a shy, cautious bachelor?
 
 I feel there is a quiet vibe, have things in common, neither are wearing wedding rings and there is lots of direct eye contact and he frequently smiles. When he left the Guidance office, he turned back and smiled. Um. 🤭😚 He acts like Colin Firth and the Portuguese housekeeper in Love Actually, but smiles more.

  When I pass other male teachers at the school, these married teachers act serious and reserved and minimize interactions as most married guys do. 

  Does the former teacher like me? The school secretary and CYW joked that I should take a shot.  Like say ""You seem like a happy person. I like your vibe. Wanna grab coffee at lunch? "" But I was too shy and said ""It was nice talking to you"".

We both visit the school itinerantly, don't work at the school on a daily basis and can easily visit the school on alternate days. 

  Does he like me? What is going on here? What should I do? I'm a divorced mom, would like a bf and think I should date someone with more in common with me (like him). I am very professional and would never date a coworker. But I qwould rarely see him and can set my own schedule. I have a crush on him and can't focus at work. 🫣😅

Though I knew if I saw those hand-sized mosquitos and beetles the size of footballs I wouldn't feel so relaxed. The only bug I liked was a stick bug the length of a mini-golf putter that hung out by my window. In those hours by myself, hot coffee was a cold comfort, but my job had one basic requirement: stay awake. Besides the coffee, being reminded of the dangers of this period kept me agitated enough. 

It was not a complicated job, at least under ordinary circumstances, just keeping my eyes on the green lights on the grid and any incoming calls from outposts and travelers. If there were any yellow lights or red ones, call VECTOR Central Command and have them figure it out (this was especially the case when they blinked). They paid me well enough to do it, and it was my part in keeping the community safe. At that point, my fellow watchdog Kimber walked in, groggy and frog throated with a fleece blanket caped over his shoulders. 

""Ya need more quinine?"" I asked him.

He nodded, ""Also bored. Thought I needed to walk a bit. God, I hate these stone-age diseases."" He went to the kitchen to make himself another cup of medicine.

""Cretateous."" I said, being pedantic. “The Paleolithic is a few years away.”

He glared at me and took a sip. 

An incoming call, indicated by the 0 channel button turning orange. I took it, talking into my earpiece. ""This is Outpost Q4-03, identify.""

A tinny male voice picks up on the other side. ""This is Arman Saab of the Rowman Mining Company, requesting safe passage into Cumberland County, code 60578.""

I checked the incoming logs, trying to reference their clearance code. Green, cleared by Central Command. ""Your request is granted, drive safely."" 

""Thank you, over and out."" He shut down the line. 

I looked out through the wrap-around windows toward the southeast where the imaginary, 575 square mile line called ""Cumberland County"" would be. I never saw one of those mining platforms up close before but they ought to be a sight to the naked eye. A small, shambling factory-city resting on a platform about four hectares in size, slowly driven on wheels about six stories tall. Maybe when it came through the mountain pass, I thought, I could see it. 

As I looked out, a large moth thumped onto the glass right by my face. Kimber was laughing as I jumped back with a yelp. The thing looked like a white, fuzzy shirt. 

""It usually takes about a year to get used to them."" Kimber said with toothy grin.

I looked back, ""They're still just as freaky after 6 months, I don't know if I'll ever get 'used to them.'"" 

He shrugged and sat in the recliner, ""Maybe you just need some more exposure. You know, maybe some action in the field. That's what I did.""

""If I wanted a dirty job, I would've stayed in 2135."" I said. 

He shook his head. ""You're a young guy, you should try to get your hands a bit rough before taking something a bit more comfy."" He reclined all the way back and stroked his remaining white hair with his large hands.

""An accountant makes for a poor landfill recycler."" I said back. I didn't hear anything back, thinking I shut him up, but he actually fell asleep. Whatever this strain of malaria is, it isn't a joke. It’s not deadly but it certainly knocks you out and can't exactly be prevented, you just have to endure it. I suspected I'd come down with it in a day or two, so we called for a third help, and they’d be coming by sunrise tomorrow. 

I didn't hate Kimber but he was certainly old fashioned, maybe a bit entitled since he endured the Second Great Reset of 2090. I might have been, too, in his position. He just won't accept that the future comes after the young much more than the old. I'm lucky that VECTOR was able to send people to this time and made jobs that didn't require shovels and rakes. The past is truly the land of opportunity. 

A few hours passed and I received another call. ""This is Outpost Q4-03, identify.""

""Outpost Q4-03, this is Blake with VECTOR, ID B709D4. I'm here as the emergency member.""

The voice was feminine; tenor, stern, yet sweet. I replied back, ""This is Paleto, ID G610E5. I see you're still about an hour out. Any difficulties?""

""None so far. It doesn't look like the storm last night affected the roads too much. I should arrive with the drop-off team by 606 hours.""

""Affirmative. You're clear. Over and out."" I closed the line and leaned back on my chair.

Maybe something primitive took over at that point, hearing the voice of a woman, one who was coming soon. I realized how little time I had before she would arrive, so I started cleaning up the outpost, and this probably woke Kimber up. 

""Why the cleaning?"" He grumbled. 

""The third arrival's coming soon, I thought I should tidy up the place. The name's Blake."" I said. 

""Aw damn, they sent a woman didn't they."" He covered his eyes up.

""I didn't say anything about her being a woman."" I said. 

""A young man doesn't think about how messy he is unless they're seeing a girl."" He said, falling back into sleep. 

""There's nothing wrong with cleaning, and there's certainly nothing wrong with a woman watchdog."" I replied.

""Well,"" he said on the doorstep of sleep, ""mind yourself... want no drama..."" 

I threw away the tissues, vacuumed the floors, scrubbed the smudges on the kitchen counters, wiped the coffee stains on the console desks, reordered the furniture in the workspace and the lounge, and made sure the third bedroom was set and ready. After I realized how sweaty I had gotten from the quick cleaning, I realized how childish I felt, being excited for her. 

I saw on the security cameras a large, 8-person ATV was pulling in, VECTOR written along the side. On the top was a ball turret, as well as a turret on the back. It drove onto the platform and called in. 

""This is Outpost Q4-03, identify."" I said. 

The driver answered, ""This is ATV-087 codename Snowden here to deliver Blake."" 

""We recieve you. Prepare for transfer."" I answered back. 

A loud beeping blared as the platform was raised about 15 feet into the air, leading up to a boarding bridge. The computer figured out how to attach itself to the vehicle. From the security camera, I could see a blurry shadow leave the side of the ATV and get into the enclosed walkway. As she entered the tower, I heard over the radio, ""Transfer complete.""

""Copy that. Prepare for departure."" The bridge was disconnected and the beeping started again, lowering the platform back to the ground. The vehicle backed up and drove up back to the trail. 

I could hear the elevator humming as it climbed up to the observation level. I got up to greet her, my heart fluttering a bit. In my head I was trying to guess what she might look like based on her voice. If she had a tenor, maybe she was a ginger or blonde, possibly skinny? I didn't have much time to think about it because she rushed out as soon as the doors opened.

She stopped herself just short of running into me. ""Oh! Gosh, I'm sorry.""

""No, I'm sorry,"" I said, trying to be polite.

""So are you Kimber? No, Kimber is sick, you're Paleto."" She looked inquisitively.

""Yes, I'm Paleto, John Paleto."" I said, extending my hand. 

""Pleased to meet you, I'm Kathleen Blake. Gosh, I hate using all that ID talk, don't you?"" She said, rapidly shaking my hand with a big smile. 

I was not prepared to meet someone who was so charmingly nerdy. ""Yeah, it's annoying. Well, your quarters are downstairs, room 3, it should all be in order."" 

""Oh yes, thank goodness, I need a nap, it's impossible to sleep in those terrible things. Ugh."" She headed toward the door but suddenly turned right around, ""Oh, wait, you probably want the rest, right? You must've been awake for, what, 48 hours?"" 

""I'm fine and perfectly caffinated."" I said, raising my mug. ""You're our guest, I'd rather you be rested.""

""Well thank you! To be honest, I don't think I've slept the last few days, either."" She giggled. ""Ah, all the little hats they make me wear. Well, see you in, like, 3 hours.""

""Sure, but you can sleep longer-” she already went downstairs to quarters. I realized I just said *sure* instead of something more polite to a stranger, a lady at that, and I knocked my head a few times. 

Kimber got up, realizing he had gone unnoticed. ""Well I should get proper rest, too, and stay out of Kay's sight.""

""You know her?"" I asked. 

He turned his hand over a few times, ""She's known to take a lot of different positions at the company, sort of a paratrooper, jack of all trades, you know what I mean?"" 

""No."" 

""Well, you can get to know her better soon. Stay healthy, Jack."" He lumbered down to quarters. 

About half an hour passed as I was looking at the beautiful jungle morning, the whole valley blanketed with mist as streaks of sunlight broke through. I was finally feeling it, the dreadful comfort of dozing in and out. I was hoping ""Kay"" would come soon but I also didn't have much to do, either. Even these office chairs can be so soothing to sit in while this sleepy.

But one of the security cameras started flashing red. I jerked up and saw on the footage about 8 turkey-looking things on the feed. They were inspecting the emergency ladder on the side of the tower. Though it was about 8 feet off the ground, they were sizing it up. They could leap for it, sure, but it would take an effort. 

I waited to see what they'd do as per protocol. If they start jumping for the ladder, that's when you shock them. They need to be hurt, not just scared. If they're only scared they will most certainly come back, but if one of them is hurt or killed they will more likely move on. I had my hand over the button, waiting to see what they'd do. 

One of them lept, didn't get close. Another one tried, didn't make it. But there was a third one, larger with brighter colors, waiting its turn. It lept, grabbed hold of the lower bar, and I let my finger down. 

A loud blare and a red light went off, the guy hanging on started shaking violently. The rest of them scattered into the brush as fast as possible as their comrade fell down unmoving to the ground. I stared at it as little black plumes rose from it, lightly cooked from 9000 volts. But I was startled when suddenly the thing got up again, looked around confused, looked at the ladder, screeched at it, and went to join the rest of the pack. 

I shook my head, ""Fuckin' raptors.”

It's Kendu's Time,"Finally, Jan 2026 and the market has started to regain some volume after a few dead months. Ethereum is up 9%, Pepe is up 56% on the week, Doge is up 20%, Shib is up 25% and many others are up heavily as well. 

So, what could happen next?

Honestly idk, but it could be the start of a larger rise and some sort of alt season which has been predicted for months and months now. 

For the best gains, you kinda wanna get in now, the bottom looks to already have been in and Up season is potentially here.

No matter what the market does though, you wanna invest in solid projects, not flimsy ones relying on a KOL or some sort of viral meme, but instead a real community.

This is why I suggest **Kendu.**

Over 20 IRL projects such as spices, merch, coffee... and with a community solid enough to rival 2021 Shib. This is no exaggeration, we absolutely dominate Reddit and Stocktwits, with also a heavy presence on X. X is harder to measure but we trend frequently!

We are also the 2nd coin to ever manage 50k Certik Votes with the only other coin being Pepe...

Certik is the most reputable auditor for blockchain technology and they rate Kendu's community at 94, whilst SPX has a score of 88 and Pepe has a score of 91. Imagine the community strength Kendu will have when we even have remotely near their number of holders... it will be immeasurable.

Obvs do your research, but should give it a shot, whether you skip the daily Starbucks or weekly Dominos to add a DCA, it could pay off very handsomely.

1q621jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q621jf/my_world_doesnt_want_me_to_want_anything_anymore/,My world doesn't want me to want anything anymore.,"I'm a mostly starving 39 year old at a job that constantly makes me want to blow my brains out. I work anymore from 11 to 16 hours a day, I don't get to see my wife or kids,  and on the rare occasion that I do, my wife wants nothing to do with me. 

I'm told my need for physical touch is too much. We have two children under 10, one of which is almost two. So I understand being touched out. But I'm made to feel like I don't deserve it bc I don't do enough at home, but I'm never at home because we need money to live. And when I am at home I always let her get more sleep and I don't hold to any sort of standard that she needs to meet. 

I wake up every morning and prepare her coffee, do a load of laundry, and hastily eat my breakfast, get the kids together, take them to school, and go to work. Sometimes I go to work and by the time I get back home everyone is already in bed. I try to get into bed next to her and she grunts and pushes me away. 

What hurts more than all of that is we are in a poly relationship. I see the effort that goes into her talking to other people. I haven't been on a date in years bc, I hate myself. I don't love myself. This lack of intimacy from the person that is supposed to love me most has wrecked me. We are only intimate maybe once every six months. 

My medication hasn't even been helping. I've had suicidal ideation. And the fact that I can't even get her to make out with me or cuddle but she can with other people no problem, is murder. The lifestyle used to be easy, but now it's just telling me that I'm not good enough. The work I put in, how tired I am all the time, how much I sacrifice for everyone. I dont ask for anything and when I do, it's too much. 

I'm so lonely and I don't know what to do. There's hardly a point in any say that even gives me a hint of a smirk anymore. ",1,1767750199.0,depression,1,1.0,False

I was recently given a very near new De'Longhi Specialista Arte evo, it was basically opened and left to sit without use, so I don't have any manuals. It wasn't what I was planning on buying, but I figured it was free and a good place to start. 

My main concern is the weight of a single basket of ground and tamped coffee. The Arte Evo baskets come with a line in them and it suggests this is where the top of your tamped grind should sit, I have no issue meeting the line perfectly almost every time and on different grind regulations. The issue is the weight of the ground, its coming in at 4g when the recommended weight is 7-10g. I could never get that amount of coffee into the basket! 

I am using Aldi Lazzio Brazil beans, that are supposedly medium-dark, but in my inexperienced opinion, they seem to be mostly dark coloured, and burnt smelling. From what I have researched, its possible the beans are fluffy because they are very dark roasted, which causes them to weight very little while still remaining the same size. 

I figured I'd ask here before getting a refund from Aldi and trying different beans. Any thoughts on the matter would be appreciated",1,1767749802.0,AustralianCoffee,7,1.0,False

1q61rok,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1q61rok/how_to_avoid_cliches/,How to Avoid Cliches,"I've seen some of you abuse clichés, and you don't even know you're doing it. Worse, you're calling yourselves writers too. I'm here to help you understand why you need to avoid clichés, and what you need to do to avoid them.

First of all, look at the sub ""Brand New Sentence"" and just sort by top. What you're going to notice immediately is that a lot of these sentences are brand new, and because they are brand new, there is NOTHING you cannot write that is not brand new.

There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and **that can make up to 67,108,863 possible combinations of words,** and this is if the constraint is only 6 words. *(So what this means is there is always going to be a new way of saying something; the* ***English*** *language permits it.)* And if English permits it, and you're calling yourself a writer, you absolutely can do it.

**What is a Cliché?**

I love definitions; I love coming up with my own, but we're going to use Oxford here. *(You need to fall in love with definitions; if you haven't, stop writing and read the dictionary for a year) (I promise there* ***are*** *plenty of words you think you know* ***the meaning of,*** *but consider the fact that you most likely adopted them through context, not because you looked up the definition and learned EXACTLY how it was to be used.)*

A cliché is a phrase or opinion that is overused and betrays a lack of original thought.

This is a matter of my opinion. **But the majority of people are walking clichés.** They don't have their own phrases; they've picked those up from their favorite TV shows and movies *(do you know anyone who quotes The Office all the time? Hit that fool over the head with a hammer, btw. We've had enough).* **But their ENTIRE arsenal of words is locked to what they see on TV and the internet.**

**The majority of people's opinions are completely copy and pasted**. Most people are not taking long walks to think about stuff. Most people don't have the cognitive tools to filter the world as it comes in and wait and just be opinionless. **THEY MUST HAVE ONE.** *(This is most likely of a group they belong* ***to***\*; you will notice too, if you're someone in a group, you're sharing A LOT from that group: phrases, opinions, how you look, how to feel, the group is a reference point on how to be.)\*

**Antagonism towards A rtificial Intelligence is one of my more favorite clichés.**

Most of the folks have adopted opinions; most people don't even USE **a rtificial** intelligence. *(I was at a* ***Jack in the Box*** *and there was this elderly lady trying to use the ""self-checkout"" and she was becoming irate because she didn't know how to use it. She turned around and asked people for help; I just told her she could do it. And that I believed in her. She didn't think it was funny. But I didn't think her going ALL HER LIFE without learning the most basic of skills* ***was*** *funny* ***either.*** *I do not enable people. I've seen enough of that going around.)* Those people who've adopted their opinions about **a rtificial** intelligence are going to be the same frustrating people we have to deal with eventually, looking around at the world to solve their problems. Completely useless.

Personally, I don't think you can have an opinion on anything unless you've had frequent extended use. This is what is called experience. And experience, less or more, will always matter. Granted, there **are** going to be things that you've never experienced, and you want to write about. I would suggest **simulating** that experience as much as you humanly can. Or you're useless. **But, this is where the originality comes from. YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.** *(This could also be known as an angle, or perspective.)*

**Lo and behold, there is no one else like you on this planet.** And that is to say, there is nobody on this planet experiencing the world the way you're experiencing it. And you have all these words to take experience, and shape it into an image, for someone else to read and understand. And you can change the way they feel by choosing how you say something.

A cliché is not a way of saying something; **it's an automatic response aimed to fill in gaps so your brain doesn't think.**

Again, clichés are completely automated. That means you'll write it first and then see it later. So, how can we deal with some clichés? Well, let's get a single example going.

*""Think outside the box.""*

You might not have a character say this, but maybe you will. And maybe your character is not cliché; maybe he's the main character. Maybe he says things **differently**. In new ways. All the while, still MEANING **the same** thing.

*""Listen, you're so stuck inside the box I can see the shadows of the wall covering you. Why don't you step outside. Look around, and find something new, how about that? Then yes, we can go get coffee... ""*

Wordy, you bet. We live in times where brevity is doing more gutting than it is doing anything beneficial.

In this case, we've UNPACKED the cliché and made it more visual. This is the most important thing about clichés: **They are zip files.**

Do you know what a zip file is? It compresses data so you can open monstrous files without having to wait. It makes things so much more compact. What happens when you double click a zip file? You can double click clichés the same. And what you're going to unpack should be, actually, overwhelming. **Suppose** you did this when you noticed a cliché; **suppose** you could double click it. Well, you cannot double click clichés, can you?

...but, you can do something better and ask **""What does this mean?""**

**""What does this mean""** is a trusty shovel that can unpack your cliché, giving you worlds of meaning, and with all those combined with experience, a new way to say an old thing...

**While trying and failing to keep things brief,** are clichés ever okay?

No, never. Well, that's my **personal** philosophy. I've made exceptions for them, and that's the only reason why I think a cliché could ever fly. **It is** because you recognized it and had an argument for its existence. *(It's okay to fight for your writing; you should, based on the fact you have a solid argument..)*

In conclusion, this should make writing a little harder, but, because it's going to be harder, it's going to be better because of it. You'll take something dead floating around in your writing and bring new life to it, in such a way that has never been read, or even written before. But it's not easy.

I admit even **in** my own combing over (I like combing because of the visual) this post I cannot say for sure that I went without a single cliché other than my examples. But that is the challenge. And in time, you get better and better and better, and more importantly...

More original.

Edit: There was a warning here about my use of ""A I"" and ""A rtifical intelligence"" and because I'm using that terminology, and I have affirm that it's in reference to, it's not the topic. **It's my absolute favorite, modern, ongoing reference.**

I have to add too I think it's completely fucking bonkers the mods have ""automated"" what people can say and not say about A I, how funny is that...

my main concerns are pigmentation in my face, uneven and patchy skin and i hate my eyebrows but i can’t do much about them. i’ve recently started shaving my face and that helped so much but there’s more work to be done 

my sleep schedule is completely wack and irregular and i often skip meals bcs i don’t like eating much, i don’t workout and im not active, im bedrotting 90% of the time. because of this i don’t think i need any products but a complete lifestyle change now. ive started picking up some hobbies and going out with friends to help me feel better and it has been working but i still feel bad appearance wise.

1q61pf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverHint/comments/1q61pf0/everhint_signal_ema10_price_macd_january_06_2026/,"EverHint Signal — EMA10 × Price × MACD — January 06, 2026","**What This Signal Is (Quick)**

**EMA10 × Price × MACD** is an experimental momentum strategy that requires **two bullish crossovers to happen simultaneously** on the same day:

  1. **Price crosses above EMA10 from below**

     * Yesterday: Price was below or at the 10-day exponential moving average
     * Today: Price breaks above EMA10
     * Signals: Short-term trend reversal from down to up
  2. **MACD Line crosses above Signal Line from below**

     * Yesterday: MACD Line was below or at the Signal Line
     * Today: MACD Line crosses above Signal Line
     * Confirms: Bullish momentum shift at the indicator level



**Double Confirmation = Higher Quality**

This dual-crossover requirement filters for stocks where both price action AND momentum indicators confirm a bullish shift—meaning fewer signals (typically 10-30 per day) but higher conviction setups.

**Key Characteristics:**

  * **Buy signals only** : This strategy generates only bullish signals (no sell signals)
  * **Fewer but higher quality** : Dual confirmation = 5-30 signals/day vs. 20-40 for single-indicator strategies
  * **Fast response** : EMA10 is sensitive—catches early moves without lag of slower MAs
  * **Momentum context** : MACD adds underlying momentum confirmation beyond just price
  * **Swing trading focus** : Ideal for 1-4 week holding periods



**This is an experimental scanner.** Signals are for educational purposes and backtesting—not trade recommendations. Always do your own due diligence.

**How We Ranked Today (Reader Version)**

We ranked all buy signals by **RSI(14)** from lowest to highest. For buy signals, lower RSI = more oversold = better risk/reward when crossed up (buying into strength from oversold levels).

We've also overlaid:

  * **Insider Net (USD)** : Net insider buying or selling over 90 days (P-S only, excluding awards/exercises)
  * **Days → Earnings** : Time until next earnings report (event risk or potential catalyst)



**Ranking Logic:**

  * **RSI < 35**: Very oversold—bouncing from extreme weakness
  * **RSI 35-50** : Moderately oversold to neutral—healthy pullback bounce
  * **RSI 50-70** : Overbought territory—momentum continuation but higher risk
  * **RSI > 70**: Extremely overbought—late-stage momentum, high reversal risk



**Important:** Signals are for educational use and backtesting. Not financial advice.

* * *

**Field Notes**

**Key Metrics Explained:**

  * **RSI(14)** : Relative Strength Index (0-100 scale). <30 = oversold, >70 = overbought. For buy signals, lower RSI = buying into strength from oversold levels.
  * **Insider Net (USD)** : Net insider purchases minus sales over 90 days (P-S only). Negative = selling, positive = buying.
  * **Days → Earnings** : Time until next earnings report. <14 days = high volatility risk, >45 days = lower event risk.
  * **EMA10** : 10-day exponential moving average. Price crossing above = short-term bullish reversal.
  * **MACD** : MACD Line crossing above Signal Line = bullish momentum confirmation.



**Sector Rotation Observations:**

  * **Healthcare leads** with 6 signals (22%): ISRG, SYK, GSK, LH, DGX, CYTK—defensive rotation into healthcare
  * **Technology** with 9 signals (33%): PANW, AI, FOUR, PTC, CYBR, LYFT, VRSN, CIEN—tech still dominant
  * **Consumer Cyclical** with 6 signals (22%): PVH, AAP, VAC, BROS, RCL, WEN—consumer bouncing from oversold
  * **Consumer Defensive** with 2 signals (7%): CHD, FLO—defensive staples
  * **Industrials** with 3 signals (11%): DE, RRX, MAS—industrial equipment and construction
  * **Real Estate** (NSA), **Communication Services** (LUMN), **Financial Services** (BEN)—scattered



Healthcare + Technology = 55% of signals—classic defensive + growth rotation.

**RSI Distribution:**

  * **Very Oversold (RSI < 35):** 3 signals (11%)—PVH, AAP, VAC
  * **Moderately Oversold (35-50):** 11 signals (41%)—Best risk/reward zone
  * **Neutral (50-60):** 8 signals (30%)—Balanced momentum
  * **Overbought (60-70):** 4 signals (15%)—GSK, SYK, CIEN, ISRG
  * **Extremely Overbought ( >70):** 1 signal (4%)—ISRG (RSI 70.7)



Most signals (52%) are in the 35-60 RSI range—healthy pullback bounces with dual confirmation.

**Insider Activity Warning:**

  * **BROS:** -$18.7M (10% owners dumping)
  * **ISRG:** -$13.9M (CEO selling heavily)
  * **CYTK:** -$4.1M (officers selling)
  * **AI:** -$3.6M (CEO selling)
  * **DGX:** -$1.5M (CEO and director)
  * **CIEN:** -$1.6M (CEO)
  * **VRSN:** -$521K (CEO)
  * **FOUR:** -$440K (CEO)
  * **PANW:** -$142K (director)
  * **LYFT:** +$100K (CEO BUYING)—only insider purchase in the entire list!



Heavy insider selling across most names. Only LYFT CEO is buying. This suggests insiders are taking profits into strength—proceed with caution.

**Earnings Risk ( < 30 Days):**

  * **ISRG: 16 days** (Jan 22)—HIGH RISK: Earnings in 2 weeks + RSI 70.7 + insider selling -$13.9M. Don't hold through earnings.
  * **RCL: 21 days** (Jan 27)—Moderate risk, cruise line earnings
  * **SYK: 21 days** (Jan 27)—Moderate risk, medical devices
  * **DGX: 23 days** (Jan 29)—Moderate risk, healthcare diagnostics
  * **CHD: 24 days** (Jan 30)—Moderate risk, consumer staples
  * **BEN: 24 days** (Jan 30)—Moderate risk, asset management
  * **LUMN: 28 days** (Feb 3)—Threshold risk
  * **GSK: 29 days** (Feb 4)—Threshold risk
  * **PTC: 29 days** (Feb 4)—Threshold risk
  * **RRX: 29 days** (Feb 4)—Threshold risk



10 signals have earnings within 30 days—consider exiting before earnings if unwilling to hold through volatility.

**Vlad's Take (EverHint)**

**Market Backdrop (Jan 6, 2026):**  
Markets extended gains Tuesday with S&P 500 up 0.53% to 6,944.83 (new all-time high), Nasdaq up 0.43% to 23,547.17, and Dow up 0.97% to 49,462.09. The VIX closed at 14.75 (down 1.67%), signaling low-to-normal volatility—ideal for swing trades. Small-caps outperformed with Russell 2000 up 1.49% to 2,582.90, indicating broad market strength. Treasury yields rose slightly (10Y at 4.179%, up 0.14%), and crypto was mixed (Bitcoin -0.39%, Ethereum +1.84%). Overall: **risk-on environment with strong breadth** —perfect conditions for dual-crossover setups.

**Strategy Commentary:**  
Today's EMA10 × Price × MACD scan captured 27 buy signals where both price action AND momentum indicators confirmed bullish shifts. With markets hitting new all-time highs and VIX at 14.75, this is an ideal environment for swing trades with technical confirmation.

**Four Observations:**

  1. **Healthcare + Tech dominate (55% of signals):** This is a defensive + growth rotation. Healthcare (ISRG, SYK, GSK, LH, DGX, CYTK) + Technology (PANW, AI, FOUR, PTC, CYBR, LYFT, VRSN, CIEN) make up 15 of 27 signals. This suggests investors are rotating into growth (tech) and defensive quality (healthcare) simultaneously—classic late-cycle behavior.

  2. **RSI distribution is healthy:** 52% of signals are in the 35-60 RSI range—this is the sweet spot for dual-crossover buys. These are stocks pulling back to oversold/neutral levels, then crossing up with MACD confirmation. The very oversold names (PVH, AAP, VAC) offer best risk/reward if downtrends reverse. The overbought names (ISRG, CIEN, SYK, GSK) are momentum chases—higher risk but potentially higher reward if momentum persists.

  3. **Heavy insider selling is a red flag:** BROS (-$18.7M), ISRG (-$13.9M), CYTK (-$4.1M), AI (-$3.6M), DGX (-$1.5M), CIEN (-$1.6M)—insiders are dumping into strength. The only insider BUY is LYFT CEO (+$100K). This is late-stage behavior. Insiders sell at highs, retail buys breakouts. Use tight stops and don't overstay your welcome.

  4. **Earnings risk is elevated:** 10 of 27 signals (37%) have earnings within 30 days. ISRG has earnings in 16 days + RSI 70.7 + insider selling -$13.9M—this is a triple red flag. If you trade ISRG, exit before earnings (Jan 22). Same for RCL, SYK, DGX (earnings Jan 27-29).




**Trading Tips for Dual Crossovers:**

**Entry Strategy:**

  * **Don't chase today's close.** Wait for tomorrow's pullback or consolidation near today's close.
  * **Use limit orders** at or slightly below today's close. Let the stock come to you.
  * **Confirm volume tomorrow:** If stock gaps up but volume is weak, wait for volume confirmation.
  * **Scale in:** Take 50% position on entry, add 25% if stock holds above EMA10 for 2+ days, add final 25% if MACD histogram expands (momentum accelerating).



**Position Sizing:**

  * **Start with 1-2% of portfolio per signal.** Don't go heavy on dual crossovers—they can fail quickly if momentum doesn't follow through.
  * **Max 5-7 signals total** from the 27. Pick highest-conviction setups (low RSI, no insider selling, >30 days to earnings).
  * **Diversify by sector:** Don't take all healthcare or all tech. Spread across 3+ sectors.



**Stop Loss (CRITICAL):**

  * **Tight stops below EMA10:** Once price crosses above EMA10, use EMA10 as your stop. If price closes below EMA10, exit—the crossover failed.
  * **Alternative stop:** Use yesterday's low or today's low, whichever is closer. Example for PANW: Close $185.86, today's low likely ~$182. Stop at $181 (just below today's low). Risk = 2.6%.
  * **MACD reversal stop:** If MACD Line crosses back below Signal Line, exit—momentum confirmation failed.
  * **Move stops to breakeven** once stock moves 3-5% in your favor. Lock in gains quickly.



**Take Profit:**

  * **Conservative:** 5-10% gain (1-2 weeks)—take full profit at EMA10 crossover targets
  * **Aggressive:** 10-15% gain (2-4 weeks)—hold until MACD Line crosses back below Signal Line or price closes below EMA10
  * **Scale out:** Take 50% off at +5-7%, trail stops on remaining 50%



**Time Stop:**

  * **Exit if no progress in 1 week.** Dual crossovers either work quickly (within 3-5 days) or stall. Don't let them become dead money.
  * **Exit before earnings if <14 days.** ISRG, RCL, SYK, DGX, CHD—exit by Jan 20 if you don't want to hold through earnings.



**My Top 7 Picks (Best Risk/Reward):**

  1. **PVH (RSI 31.7, $70.01):** Most oversold signal. Apparel brand bouncing from lows. Stop below $68, target $74-76 (+6-9%). Earnings in 83 days (low risk). High risk/reward on downtrend reversal.

  2. **AAP (RSI 34.8, $41.36):** Auto parts retailer bouncing, launched new ARGOS brand. Stop below $39, target $44-45 (+6-9%). Earnings in 50 days.

  3. **PANW (RSI 41.9, $185.86):** Cybersecurity leader bouncing from 14% pullback. **""Buy and Hold for the Next Decade""** (Motley Fool). Stop below $182, target $195-200 (+5-8%). Earnings in 37 days. Quality name with dual confirmation.

  4. **LH (RSI 45.3, $260.40):** Labcorp crossing up, no insider selling. Stop below $253, target $270-275 (+4-6%). Earnings in 30 days. Above SMA200—uptrend confirmation.

  5. **DE (RSI 48.3, $485.98):** Deere crossing up, no insider selling. Stop below $466, target $500-510 (+3-5%). Earnings in 37 days. Blue-chip industrial with dual confirmation.

  6. **LYFT (RSI 58.1, $19.86):** **CEO BUYING +$100K** —only insider purchase in entire list. Stop below $19, target $21-22 (+6-11%). Earnings in 35 days. Insider buy = high conviction.

  7. **GSK (RSI 63.0, $50.56):** **Japan approved new asthma drug Exdensur** (Jan 6)—catalyst. Stop below $49, target $53-54 (+5-7%). Earnings in 29 days. Pharma with new drug approval + dual crossover.




**Avoid:**

  * **ISRG (RSI 70.7, earnings in 16 days, insider selling -$13.9M):** Triple red flag—overbought + earnings risk + heavy insider selling. If you must trade, exit before Jan 22 earnings.
  * **BROS (insider selling -$18.7M):** 10% owners dumping $18.7M—this is a distribution phase. Avoid.
  * **AI (insider selling -$3.6M, RSI 43.2, below SMA200):** CEO sold $3.6M, stock in long downtrend. Mixed sentiment. High risk.
  * **CYTK (insider selling -$4.1M, legal investigation):** Grabar Law Office investigating shareholder claims. Officers selling heavily. Avoid.
  * **Low-conviction setups:** Signals with RSI > 65 (CIEN, SYK, ISRG) + earnings within 30 days + insider selling. Too many red flags.



**Risk Warning:**  
Dual crossovers can fail quickly if momentum doesn't follow through. Always use stop losses below EMA10 or yesterday's low. If price closes below EMA10 or MACD crosses back below Signal Line, exit immediately—the setup failed. Never risk more than 1-2% of portfolio on any single dual-crossover trade.

1q61o05,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine-induced_anxiety_disorder,Coffee causes overthinking and anxiety in a BIG way - don’t underestimate it,"I wrote this as a comment on another post, but I thought I should repost it here as a public service announcement. Some of you acknowledge that coffee can give you anxiety or overthinking. But you may undermine the impact by calling it “the jitters”, like many people do. That completely underestimates the mental damage it can do. 

Coffee ABSOLUTELY causes anxiety and overthinking in many people. And not in a small way, no. In a HUGE way - to the extent that coffee-induced anxiety is often misdiagnosed as bipolar or schizophrenia.

See: caffeine-induced anxiety disorder.

When I quit coffee, my long-term habit of overthinking vanished. Just vanished.

To those of you who have other issues and rely on coffee to “get you through the day”, maybe your issues are being CAUSED by the coffee, not solved by it.

1q61nhb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q61nhb,My mom lied about throwing her cigarette butts outside of an AirBnB during Christmas and is now feeling sorry for herself,"My mom has a history of doing stupid/bad things and then lying about it. She’s done it all her life and has never faced accountability. She is also an alcoholic. 

She is completely broke and lives off of social security/disability but only gets about $1200 per month. She has a “male friend” who comes to her place sometimes, he is nice and will help her out financially and bring her food. That’s who I was referring to in the first text I sent. 

So for Christmas my husband and I, mom and a couple other family members went to an Airbnb for a few days. My husband and I split the cost with my aunt because my mom can’t afford to pay her way. My mom is a lifelong chainsmoker but apparently is now on a medication to help her quit. She wasn’t smoking as much as normal but she was still smoking during the trip. The Airbnb had a balcony and she would smoke outside. I knew it was nonsmoking and I told her this but she did it anyway. She was apparently keeping her cigarette butts in the carton and when we left she picked them all up and none were left on the balcony. 

So a few days after we left I get an email from Airbnb saying that there was a complaint from someone below us that there were several cigarette butts thrown on their patio, and some of them burned a hole in their patio furniture. 

Technically nobody saw her do this, including none of us,  and there’s no proof, but I know for a fact she did this. She is very very disrespectful when it comes to her smoking, she always throws her butts wherever she wants and sees nothing wrong with it. So her denying it means nothing to me. 

So I texted my mom a screenshot of their email and this was her response. Total denial, no accountability. She also called me that night and left me a voicemail, I can tell she was drinking by her voice and she was still denying it and stuck to the story about how there was some “woman she saw” on her own balcony, who was up every single morning “smoking, coughing and drinking coffee,” and that I might need to tell the Airbnb people that this mysterious woman was the one smoking. The whole thing is a very obvious lie. How would she have even saw this person drinking coffee?? The way the place was set up, you can’t see in someone’s patio. 

We haven’t spoken since, and then today she sends me this latest text. All she knows how to do is play the victim and feel sorry for herself. I’m so sick of it.
