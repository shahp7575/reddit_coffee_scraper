Heyy so f21 from north europe here. Would love to make new long time friends and have people to talk with. I am happily taken and have no interest in anything more than having friends. I mostly use snapchat for chatting but discord could be okay too. Let's start the talking here though. 🔮

I love anything horror, gothic, pagan, dark and peculiar. HUUUGE coffee lover as it's sometimes the only thing keeping me from insanity in the cold here. I love spending time studying and gaming. Hiking and gym too. I do like to visit a shooting range few times a month too. Interested in cars too and have one of my own too which i do spend time on. My ultimate all time fave game is skyrim but atm i spend my time playing mw3.

I do study full time trying to get into med school, but i do work a bit in retail besides that. I do get busy but i always anwser when i have the time. 

My music taste is a bit weird as my fave genres are country and deathcore (i do not need to hear any ""it's not metal"" thank u, i don't care 😂). I do love the lord of the rings and have been crazy about pokemon too for a long time. Patiently waiting for terrifier 3 as it's one of my top faves. 

If ya feel like you'd like to get to know me better, send me a message. 🖤 Please tell me a bit about yourself. There's a 90% chance i won't anwser to only a ""hey"". I would prefer people around 18-30 years old. Someone who loves to keep in touch and helps me keep the convo going would be nice. 

Hope i'll hear from you. 😻

First I’d like just to say that my English might be bad I’m sorry it’s not my first language ( I’m french). So, I’m 21(F) and i have an issue with my college crush. So I’m in what you call Law school. My story begun three years ago when someone sat on my usual place and so I moved to another seat and I first led eyes on him ( my soon to be crush). He was handsome, and very tall ( I’m very small). Anyways, from then I never quit this new sit that was near him. For two years it had been a lot of eye contact, he held doors for me, turned around to see if I was looking at him. But we never smiled at each others. I could hear his friends telling him why he was looking good today and asking who is he doing it for, shit like that. I tried a move and asked for one of his lesson, he gave it to me but for the whole time he never smiled back at me and looked me in the eyes only twice. This year, he is not sitting near me anymore. And a girl he just knew this year is sitting with him now. 

Now the worst part is: I went to grab a coffee at the break and he came with her behind my back, and they seemed pretty close ( they were talking in each others ears) and I think I saw them kissing. 

After this whole delusion, I feel empty, I already consider myself as ugly but now it’s worse. I’m sad because I thought he was also into me. But I maybe realize that I was embarrassing him, making him uncorfortable. I don’t know how to act as he is still looking at me and all that. I still have feelings ( being nervous around him, etc…) but I don’t know.

Do you think he ever liked me ? What can I do ? How do I deal with my feelings?

I come from an abusive household who had drunk serial womaniser father 
My views on marriage, relationships were flawed and I believed hookup culture was the right way to live since Hey everyone cheats anyways why not live like this ( I haven't started live like this yet just dreaming)

I have been keeping this perspective for years ( 7 years ) 

When I got my first job I was excited for both Newfound office , money and friends 

Among that was a cute girl taller , more athletic than me , I felt a crush my I brushed it off as infatuation. When we were discussing our views and plans for future she'd describe having multiple kids and perfect family!

At first mocked her and told her the pleasures of living care free , she immediately started preaching how fulfilling a family life would be eventually little by little I fell for that dream and the girl 

1. We used to hold hands ( FOR A VERY LONG TIME ) , have coffee together 

2. She would look at me differently

NOW COMES THE TWIST !

Im extremely good at my job it's the only good thing in life 
It takes me only a few seconds to fix a bug or 1-2 hrs to develop features 

BUT THE GIRL was weak in it , she was recommended to the company through a family friend of the SENIOR MANAGER so she really sucks at COMP SCI

Naturally I became her sole tutor for free , coaching her day and night 
Solving her doubts and pretty much helping her pass all the exams 

What kept bugging me was that she'd so stupid which is not expected of a mechanical engineer whom she was I was always sceptical and passed it as maybe she is actually naive 



TODAY I PROPOSED TO HER WITH FLOWERS IN CAFE And she 
Said she never SAW me like a lover 
And Her parents have certain views on what her husband should be like 
Even though I promised to do anything to impress her dad 
She subtly started dropping hints about Her MOTHER'S FRIEND'S SON who works in USA and settled there having an intrest in her and she said she is OK OK with him

She is from a upper middle class family with strong family oriented backgrounds 

She DID NOT SAY NO to me but indirectly she pointed out the reasons 

WHEN I LOOK BACK I FINALLY UNDERSTOOD SHE WAS JUST USING ME TO CLIMB THE CORPORATE LADDER AND I FELL FOR THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK !

I had always been a healthy, working out person. In 2012 my job at the time was insane with growth and stress. I allowed my life to spin out of control and gained close to 75lbs. Looking back at that time in my life, I was eating crazy and drinking a six pack of soda a day between regular soda and diet soda. Fast forward to the end of that year and I began to lose weight without doing anything but eating and drinking terribly. I went from 277lbs down to 222lbs. Mentally I knew I was diabetic because it ran in my family. It was confirmed during my physical that I was officially diabetic. I honestly did not take it seriously and did not even learn how I should be eating even though I knew what I was doing wrong. I was put on Metformin and a statin. The diabetes cocktail...

I continued to eat whatever I wanted, hated finger pricking so I refused to do it. I never felt any ill affects if my sugar was high, very rarely if I ate extremely terrible I would get ""the tingles"" in my fingers and I knew it was time to ratchet it back. I think what might have made things better for a few years was going keto for the timeframe of 2016 and 2017. In 2017 life shook my world, as my dad passed away and I spiraled out of control from there. I went back to eating whatever I wanted and never checking my bs. In 2020 my doctor tried to put me on insulin and I refused because I knew that would make me gain weight and not help the situation. To add to my life turmoil my sister passed away from diabetic complications in 2022. I am fortunate that I was able to work remote and picked up my life and lived in Florida for most of that year cleaning out my parents home and my sisters house.

She passed away in January of 2022 and that entire year was not only a blur but from a health perspective was out of control. I ate out daily while the kitchen was being redone and it was always rice, beans and some meat. I was also drinking Cuban coffee daily. I am sure my fellow diabetics are cringing and know where this ended up for me.  
In October of 2022, I went to a hockey game with my son and midway through the second period I could no longer sit as it felt like someone was stabbing my in my right rear cheek. That was Sunday, I woke up Monday morning with 103.9 fever and not wanting to go to the hospital and hating needles, I toughed it out for that entire week. The fever never broke and I had zero appetite. It was a syst that by weeks end had burst and looking back now, what came out smelled like death. 

My friend convinced me to go to the ER and see what was going on. This is where things became insane.

The on call trauma surgeon came into the room and dropped the news. I was sepsis, had stage 4 gang green on my backside and his surgical team was now in ""life or limb"" protocol. He looked at me and said ""call friends and family"" to come to the hospital as you are hours away from dying and may not make the night. That was the last thing I remember, I woke up 2 1/2 days later in ICU, breathing tune inserted. I pulled my breathing tube out causing tons of bells and whistles to go off.

And I think CD Projekt Red could do a really good job in putting it together, based on cyberpunk. It's an urban fantasy. 

I'm not sure if there are any, but I feel like this category has untapped potential. Medieval fantasy has been ran through many times. I feel like we need a change. Something new. Here's what I'm thinking:

 imagine a game that plays kinda like cyberpunk, open world and everything, but fantasy instead of cyber. a city, with dragons flying over. a barista at a coffee shop with big feathery wings, or an Orc working a hot dog stand. And humans, who dont have any abilities, cane up with technology so theres still modern day things. And corporate scumbags who play human but are actually some other fantasy creatures that are power hungry. And the player character, being some random thing, or a crossbreed or something with multiple abilities like flight or shape-shifting(for gameplay fun purposes). and choices matter. like you could change into someone else and commit crimes to make sure you arent wanted, and it could be in a perk tree or something. And add other races like fairies and elves or dwarves. Imagine walking down the street and a dragon(not like a skyrim dragon, like a bigger, 4 legged dragon) attacks the city, and for a cutscene or something it destroys a part of the city, that stays destroyed. But other than that, they stay outside the city because programming would be hard, and the whole city would get destroyed. You look up, and you can sometimes see NPC's just flying around on their way to work or whatever with their big wings. I imagine the combat would be unique. Or also kinda like cyberpunk, melee anyway. And as for the storyline, I was thinking something like: someone is turning all the gentle giants (such as dragons, Griffins, minotaurs, etc) aggressive, and they're attacking at random. Or a corporate storyline where the monopolies are herding people like cattle because idk they're wendigos or something, and you and a couple friends (who could be a fairy and a centaur or whatever) need to stop them. And maybe add some nsfw stuff too like gta and cyberpunk both have. Character creation could be like a choose your race thing, like skyrim. Except the races have different active abilities, like flying (for a limited time ofc because balancing) or strength, stealth, etc. If any of you think this is a good idea, or have notes, please share and feel free to leave critiques.

Every night during our horrible bedtime routine, I swear I get so overwhelmed I’m about to pick up the phone and call the cops to come get these kids.  As soon as I actually consider it, I get really sad thinking about them ACTUALLY being gone.  I just got surgery so I’m not supposed to be moving around.. but I’m a single mom of 2, how do you expect me to rest lol.  So eventually after pushing myself all day, I needed to lay down.. it was 10pm, I had been trying to get them to bed for 2 hours as usual.. and I snapped and yelled at them and went into my room.  Excruciating pain from my surgery so I needed to lay, cry, and beg God to kill me for a bit.  It’s silent in the kids room so I think ok thank God.. they are asleep.   I walk back in and my 2 year old has a bottle of syrup (I Have a lock on my fridge, he ripped it off..) and he’s pouring it all over carpet, all over bed. EVERYWHERE!!!!!  SYRUP, GUYS.   That’s a problem for tomorrow morning, I’m about to lose my shit.  I put him in his sisters bed and called it a night.  What the fuck is this life?   I can’t even recover from emergency surgery?  Also there goes my security deposit lol. 

I don’t need advice cuz I’m sure I’ve heard it all, I just needed to type this out and say I hate this.  There are days when I’m super happy, energetic, and filled up on coffee and love my kids so much .. but there are days like this where I’m so enraged, and I look at other happy loving mothers and just hate them.

So I'm 21M, a university student. I have a huge crush on my classmate. And have already told her but she has said she doesn't like relationship stuff (I belong to Pakistan, a rather conservative society where relationships before marriage are not considered good let alone physical relationships). She is quite introvert and seems of good character. So I was quite heartbroken but I try doing different antics to impress her but she just laughs them off(not irritated) She has a very good male friend (another classmate) , who is tall+attractive. I always suspected that they both are together but he is in a relationship with some other girl and she doesn't go out with boys alone.

Now the main story is. 2 days ago, when our classes ended for the day, I saw them sitting in her car together and I got jealous AF so I put my scooty after them at a safe distance. They stopped outside some small house and went inside the gate. Now you can imagine my fury. I parked some yards away, and waited for a few minutes then climbed the wall.. I wanted to get inside the house at any cost, so I devised a quick plan and knocked on door. Till he came outside to check, I went to the back and hid there. He went back inside and then I knocked again and this time both of them scared and furious came outside and tried to check everywhere, leaving the main door open. I slowly slowly crawled away from wherever they were checking and when both of them were in backyard, I went inside the door. It was one bhk home, so I went quickly inside the only room and hid myself in the cupboard. They both came back and were in the living room. He was playfully teasing her. And she was saying that why he was with that other girl and didn't recognized her love earlier. Both were talking very sensually. (imagine my fury). Then she told him to be gentle as it was her first time and he said that he bet she wouldn't be able to walk on her legs afterwards. (imagine my fury). Then both of them came to the room and I peeked in from the cupboard all the time and boy oh boy. For the next 4 hrs, he literally busted every hole that she had in multiple positions and not once gently, and she was enjoying it AF. She kept moaning and screaming loudly and he kept banging her from left, right and centre. Especially when they were trying the ""other hole"", she literally bled. And even then he pounded her in that hole one more time. On the bed, on the couch, leaning on wall from behind.. in missionary, in doggy,.. THEY TRIED EACH FUC\*ING THING...

I was like where the F did that introvert and shy girl has gone whom I loved. I used to be very respectful and gentle around her but during all this episode he wasn't once gentle with her and even slapped her hard when she was blowing him. So after all this (4 hrs had passed), they both went to the attached bathroom and she was literally not able to walk properly. After a minute or two, her moans started again. Here I was in the cupboard, with teary eyes and a huge boner. I quietly came outside and sneaked outside the main door and then climbed the wall again and got home. All the night I was having the worst wet dreams of my life involving both of them. Yesterday in the class, both of them arrived separately as usual and were behaving like nothing had happened. She was still not able to walk properly. She was with her female friends, and I was feeling the very urge to talk to her. So I asked her for notes and she gave me those. I couldn't control myself and asked if she would like a coffee in the Cafe and she smiled and said that I've told you earlier, I don't go out with boys alone. I kept quite.. But wtf bro... Tell me straight away that you don't like me rather not wanting a relationship with anyone.

I don't know if I'm horny, sad or heartbroken since 2 days. Probably a mixture of all feelings. This event has probably given me a trauma for whole life... I can't even eat or sleep properly... She was the only girl whom I had ever loved in my life... Does this happen with all nice guys??,

","I’ve been dealing with gastritis on and off for 4 years now caused by too much acid and poor eating, exercise and sleep habits and what. I’ve always gotten pretty bad acid reflux and heart burn since I was a teenager, but it didn’t start causing me problems with damaging my stomach lining until my late 20’s. I’ve had multiple endoscopies over the years to confirm this diagnosis and I’ve become pretty experienced with learning the triggers and how to manage, heal and prevent it, although still working on the discipline to prevent it again. 

However, I know lots of people that have dealt with acid reflux and GERD and have had to take PPI’s and stop drinking coffee and what not, but they’ve never had what I have, which is a chemical abrasion of my stomach wall. I haven’t been able to find a good answer for this. My gastro doctor just said that I have a weaker stomach and that some people can be stressed and drink coffee and alcohol and everything else and never have a problem, but does anyone here have any specific information/research to help explain why that is? 

I’ve suspected that it has something to do with my stomach not healing/repairing as fast as other people’s because usually when I have a bad acid reflux attack it doesn’t immediately cause me to have this localized gnawing/stabbing pain. It often comes on a day or few days or maybe even weeks later depending on a multitude of factors. My vitamin D has been low multiple times I’ve checked over the last few years and I’ve been working on getting that up but it’s tougher and slower to do than I realized. I’m hoping that will help prevent this once I get up to normal levels by helping my stomach repair more quickly.

I've always been deeply interested in magic and drawn to it sense I was a child. I have always understood that working a spell leaves people feeling slightly drained. 

I worked a smaller spell this morning before work to cleanse a component for a bigger working tomorrow. What I was supposed to do was disperse the energies back into the earth, but a little voice in the back of my head told me to absorb it into me instead. 

So trying to trust my institution I did and completed the working, but now I feel energized instead of drained. Not physically like I just downed to coffees but mentally and on the inside. Like I'm buzzing.

1fts6at,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fts6at/financial_support_how_long_do_i_m28_wait_for_my/,Financial Support - How long do I (M28) wait for my partner (F28) to contribute? ,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years. Lived together for 5. In that time she has changed careers 3 times - went back to school for an associates degree graduated and now is working while trying to get her license in her field. 

When we first moved in together - we split all the bills in the house 50/50 and any groceries/dining out. 
Her first career move was leaving her highest paying job (bachelor's degree) to go back and work in coffee - when she made this move I took over all bills except half of our mortgage ($250) she worked there for around a year and quit to go back to school for an associates degree. From there I took over all bills and majority of groceries and dining out. So 3 years of full financial support while she's been in school. Stress from both jobs is why she quit each of them. 

She's graduated for about 6 months and working full time in her new field making a low salary ($16) an hour until she can pass her state boards and get approximately a $4/$5 an hour raise. (She did not pass her test the first time and is scheduled to retake the exam) 

I am getting frustrated with her lack of stability when it comes to her own finances and her inability to contribute to our mutual bills. 

Most recently - she went 3000 miles over an oil change - and ran her car completely out of oil and ruined the engine in her car. She said she did not have the money for an oil change. She has no savings and no way to get to work. 

So to get her back and forth to work I loaned her my vehicle and then bought a used car with what savings I have built up and spent the last week fixing the car for her to be able to get back and forth to work. It's a nice car with low miles that needed significant frame repairs that I was able to source parts and do the repair by myself in my garage. 

She orders takeout and smokes weed - I have confronted her on these two things and denies or plays off the frequency of her eating out and smoking. Still there are almost always take out bags in our trash or in the back seat of her car. I really don't care if she smokes or orders take out but with the financial situation she is in - these are not the best ways to use what she has coming in. 

We have been to probably 6 weddings this summer and she is putting pressure on me for a ring - I don't feel like I'm ready with how she's going through life. It feels so unstable and I don't know what situation we would be in if I wasn't able to cover our expenses. I feel like I have no back up if something were to happen and I couldn't earn. 

I have been ultra patient with this whole situation - I don't want her stuck working a job she doesn't like because I don't love the field I am in now. I understand that sentiment. I work full time and have a side business in my hobby that takes up many of my Saturdays in the summer and some weeknights. I am getting by and but saving minimal savings and I feel like I am falling behind on my financial goals (getting out of debt and saving toward our next house) 

I don't want to be this way but I feel like if the roles were reversed and the boyfriend is bouncing from career to career and not supporting financially that answer would be swift. 

How long do I wait to for her to ""figure it out"" ? 

TL;DR

Paying all bills and more while my girlfriend figures out life - it's been 4 years. How long do I wait?

1fts5nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortLevelPod/comments/1fts5nr/waitah_if_i_asked_my_son_to_take_more/,WAITAH if I asked my son to take more responsibility ,"My son finally came back from the psych ward. According to his doctor, he was close to severe burnout. The whole situation was incredibly stressful, and it brought back terrible memories of the stunts his mother used to pull.

The whole ""I'm having a breakdown"" act—it was right out of her playbook. He just up and left the kids, which is exactly what he constantly complains that I did.

While he was gone, the kids seemed happier. There was no stress over food, homework, chores, or anything like that. They were finally having fun, just being kids without the weight of his mood hanging over them.

When Nick came back, he spent his first day sleeping. He didn’t make dinner, didn’t say hi to the kids, didn’t do anything. He ordered lunch and dinner for himself but didn’t bother to get any for me or his siblings.

Then on Tuesday, he started yelling at me about not taking care of his grandmother the way he normally does. Nick usually takes her for walks, feeds her, handles her medication, and bathes her. But I had no idea she was in bad shape. When I tried to explain, it turned into another fight. His younger siblings came downstairs, and thankfully, they came to my defense.

Regrettably, I told him, ""See? The kids are happier under my care. You keep calling me incompetent, but it’s clear they like me better. They’re my kids.""

He just sighed and said, ""You know what? I’m done. You say the kids are happier without me? You think you can handle it all? Fine. Handle it. I’m too young for this shit. Have fun. And by the way, I was your kid too.""

Ever since then, he’s abandoned the kids again. He still lives in the house but doesn’t do anything. For example, the other day I forgot to pick up groceries for breakfast. The kids had to eat toast with butter, and all they did was complain. Meanwhile, Nick just sat there on the couch, drinking his coffee, saying, ""I normally do the grocery shopping on Sundays,"" and walked away smugly.

Or the other day, he was taking a bubble bath, but one of my sons (M13) needed his laundry done. Nick just said, ""You can ask your dad,"" and went back to his bath.

He won’t help with the kids' homework, and the only chores he does are cleaning up after himself when he cooks or uses a plate. He only helps Cole (M17).

Nick isn’t acting like himself. On Saturday, he came home after hours of being gone, not answering his phone. He stumbled in, drunk, with two friends practically carrying him. They didn’t even apologize. They just dropped him on the couch. I didn’t even know he had close friends.

He’s being completely irresponsible. He doesn’t do anything around the house, and it’s starting to fall apart. The kids don’t listen to me, and it’s all so overwhelming.

He doesn’t even take care of his grandmother anymore. How do I talk to him about taking more responsibility? I feel like I’m drowning even my girlfriend feels overwhelmed.",1,1727799732.0,ComfortLevelPod,0,1.0,False
1fts5eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fts5eh/my_childhood_holds_a_dark_secret_and_now_i_have/,My Childhood Holds A Dark Secret And Now I Have To Face It. (Part 1),"I don’t dream often, but even when I do, I don’t ponder my dreams. To me, they’re the brain's way of coping with the reality we live in, giving us condensed and digestible images or films to help us understand the stress we deal with daily. However, there are times when, after having a dream, something happens in the real world that, well, to put it plainly, correlates directly with the dream I had while in the world of slumber. Those are the dreams I pay attention to. They’re deeper than déjà vu—more like a premonition of things to come. I’d be lying if I said this happened to me often. I’m not claiming to be some kind of psychic. But regarding the dream I just had, I remember seemingly important parts as clear as glass. But, just like any dream, there are segments that I can’t recall. It’s what I imagine someone who has just woken up from surgery feels—they’re aware they had surgery but don’t know the details.

The beginning of the dream is clear to me. I was standing, staring blankly at the end of an aisle of a store. It took me a moment to figure out where I was, but after looking down the narrow aisle and seeing that it was lined with toys, I realized I was in a toy store. My blank expression broke into a glee-filled smile as I excitedly waltzed down the aisle. From what I gathered from this first part of the dream, I’m no older than 7 or 8. My happy expression only intensified when I saw that I was in the train section. I remember loving Thomas the Tank Engine around this age, so I wasted no time exploring the aisle. I probably watched *Thomas and the Magic Railroad* to exhaustion, and I used to wear a little train conductor outfit everywhere I went, even to bed sometimes. The feeling I had looking through the trains in the aisle is what I suspect an alcoholic feels entering a liquor store and browsing the bottles. After what felt like an eternity of getting lost among the wooden train engines, track sets, and toy tunnels, I finally found something that made all the other toys on the aisle, in my kid mind, feel irrelevant: a rare Special Edition Golden Thomas.

My focus was broken by a voice from the end of the aisle.

“That’s pretty cool.”

It caught me off guard, and I jumped a little. I looked to my right and saw a little girl, about my age. She was wearing a navy blue dress with a matching hairband holding back her curly, dirty-blonde hair, and her eyes were soft and friendly.

“Oh! Hi!” I said, nearly shouting, showcasing that she had scared me. She stifled a giggle at my outburst. I tried to recover and play it cool.

“Oh, hi. I didn’t see you there,” I said in a pathetic attempt at coolheadedness. I knew it didn’t work when she giggled again.

“My name is Wendy. The train. It's cool,” she said as she laughed.

“What?” I said, cluelessly.

“Oh! Yeah, I’ve wanted it forever. I’ve only seen it in commercials. Even his face is gold. It’s cool because normal Thomas has a gray face,” I said, feeling a little nerdy. “Oh, my name is Chris,” I added quickly.

She walked over and stood next to me, turning to face the wall of trains that I was looking at. Now that she was closer to me, I could see just how pale her skin was—like she hadn’t seen the sun in years.

“She’s my favorite,” Wendy said, pointing to a train above the Golden Thomas. It was Lady, the new character from *The Magic Railroad*.

“Yeah, yeah, she’s pretty cool,” I said, thinking to myself that the Golden Thomas was way cooler.

She replied with a strange response, or at least odd for a six-year-old. She said, “They just got these this morning when freight came in on the truck.” She sighed deeply. “Just in time for the holiday shopping season. The funny thing is, I bet half the associates aren’t even aware they’re in yet. Worse yet, I don’t even think they know it’s Black Friday tomorrow. Nobody, and I mean nobody, pays attention around here.”

I looked at her as though she had spoken to me in Latin.

“Huh?” I said, confused. I had never heard a kid my age speak like an adult before. But instead of trying to play it off, she just turned to me and said, “I know a really cool place we can go, where we can watch *The Magic Railroad*.”

“Really?! Where?” I said excitedly.

She giggled and took me by the hand.

“Come on, I'll show you.”

We both ran out of the aisle and out of the toy store.

It was then that I realized we were in a mall and the toy store was just one of many stores. We ran and skipped together down the huge main hallway of the mall, with stores having their lights off on either side of us, as if they were closed. Somehow, it didn’t shock me that we were the only ones there. I knew the mall was closed, and I just didn’t care. We ran until we came to the end of the hall where there was a Regal Movie Theater. It was open, and the lights were on, unlike the other stores, but their glow didn’t seem to illuminate that shadowy corner of the mall. The red, blue, and purple neon lights surrounding the entrance to the theater reflected off the mall’s tile flooring I was walking on. Sure enough, there was a poster advertising the Thomas movie upon entering the theater.

I looked around a little; everything seemed so familiar. The dim lighting, the weird carpet with a squiggly pattern all over it, the concession area, and the smell of popcorn. I ran over to the candy rack and just looked over all the different snacks they had. Wendy was standing in my periphery, seemingly looking at the snacks too. I spotted a pack of Twizzlers and went to grab it. Wendy suddenly whipped around quickly to face me, almost like she was on a swivel. Her speed shocked me, and I was about to laugh it off when I looked up and saw her face. Her brown eyes were now milky, sunken, and cold, their warmth having left them. The little remaining color in her face was now gone, leaving it nearly gray, and her skin almost seemed like cracked porcelain. Her mouth was gaping open like some rabid animal. Without moving her open mouth, a sound came out of it, like a speaker. In fact, now that I think about it, it did sound like an old recording with the background static and grainy audio. She said, “Stealing is bad! Don’t do it, or else! Or else—!” Then it ended as if it had been cut off.

I think she could see the fear in my expression because the color in her face returned, and her eyes became normal again. She apologized, looking down at her feet as though she was embarrassed, covering her face with her hands.

“I’m sorry,” she said softly, sounding as if she were about to cry.

It took a couple of seconds, but my fear subsided, and after a moment of awkward silence, I said timidly, “It-it’s okay.”

For some reason, I felt bad for her. She didn’t look back up at me, and I could tell she was crying now. I didn’t really know what to do, but I wanted her to know it was okay. So I went to put my hand on her shoulder. Suddenly, before I could touch her, her whole body twitched dramatically once. I could see her skin was deathly white again, and even with her hair obscuring her face, between the gaps in her blonde locks, one milky gray eye pierced my soul. I just stood in utter petrification as she whispered, “You can never leave Neverland.”

I was terrified. I didn’t know what to do, so I began to slowly back away. Once I had stepped away, I was able to see something standing far behind Wendy, down the hallway leading to the individual theaters. It was a shadow—not Wendy’s shadow, but someone else’s. Suddenly, Wendy glided out of view silently and without moving a muscle. It was as though she had frozen into a statue and the floor beneath her had become ice. She glided away from me quickly and without losing momentum. She dissolved into the dark corridor with that tall shadow. The last thing I saw of Wendy was her glaring eye before it too disappeared.

I was in shock. My kid brain was trying to grasp what was happening but failing. Now, I could see the shadow in its fullness. It was the silhouette of a tall, skinny woman with thin, stringy hair and wearing a tattered nightgown, or maybe a dress. I could make out no other details except her eyes. They were open wide and wild, almost glowing white from reflecting the neon lights. She was staring at me, silently watching. At that, I sprinted out of the theater. I was too scared to make a sound. I wanted to shout for my mother, but I couldn’t bring myself to yell. What if that girl, or whatever she was, heard me? She’d find me again, glide towards me, and then… oh God, where was my mom?

This is where my memory fails me a little. I don’t know what happened, but somehow, after running around for a while, I arrived back in the toy store and at the train aisle. The girl, or anyone else for that matter, was nowhere to be found. I was alone. I stood still, catching my breath for a moment when the allure of the Golden Thomas captured me again. I cautiously entered the aisle, but once I could see the golden train on the shelf, all apprehension left me.

“That girl was crazy,” I thought to myself. “I wasn’t going to steal anything. Why would I steal when I could just ask my mom?” I was a little worried that I couldn’t find my mom, but I was sure she was around there somewhere. I walked over, and I reached out to grab the train. Immediately, when my fingers grasped the toy’s box, everything around me changed. It was as if I were in a movie and I had just been placed in a new scene. I was leaving the toy store again and entering back into the larger structure of the mall. I was holding someone’s hand, and they were pulling me forward, but not enough for it to hurt.

Assuming it to be my mom, I first looked to see if I had the Golden Thomas, but there was nothing in my hands. I looked up to ask if my mom had it, only to realize that whoever had my hand was not my mother. I saw only a figure dressed in white and black. At first, I didn’t know how to react until I saw that this thing wasn’t taking me to a different store. It was, instead, leading me toward a rusted white door with the paint chipping off. I panicked and began to scream.

“Mom, help! No! Mom, I don’t know who this is! Help!”

But as I cried and struggled, the figure only gripped me harder and walked faster. At that moment, a sound came from the loudspeakers in the mall:

“Or else! Or else—”

It was that girl, Wendy. It repeated like that twice, being cut off at the end. But the third time, it finished:

“Or else! Or else Captain Hook will get you, Peter. Run, Peter!”

I was being pulled so hard toward the rusted door now that I thought my arm would dislocate. But no matter how hard I fought back, the black-and-white figure dragged me closer. My heart felt like it would pound out of my chest, and I continued to scream.

“Stop! Please, Mom! Somebody help!”

From beyond the rusted door, I could hear a muffled sound. It became clearer as I was being dragged closer: carnival music. It was out-of-tune carnival music, or at least something resembling that. The door swung open, and the doorway led only to pitch darkness. From within the darkness, I heard the music clearly. It was a haunting rendition of ""A Pirate’s Life for Me,"" accompanied by what was either the sound of kids screaming in glee or screaming in terror—it was impossible to distinguish. All effort to escape was hopeless. The stranger, Captain Hook, pulled me into the darkness. The sound of the ghostly music and the children was instantly replaced by the sound of a phone ringing—it was my phone. It jolted me awake, and I was freed from the grasp of the nightmare.

I immediately turned over to face my nightstand where my phone was. I grabbed it and was blinded by its brightness. My brain was still fuzzy from sleep, so this felt like a flashbang. Through my tired, squinted eyes, I saw that it was an unknown number, and I typically let those go to voicemail. Still, as an adult, I don’t like talking to strangers. Upset that this person had just interrupted my sleep, as horrifying as my nightmare was, I slammed my thumb down dramatically on the red icon. I placed it back on my nightstand and rolled over. I wasn’t tired anymore. That dream and then my phone was like an instant shot of espresso topped off with adrenaline. I lay there for a little while, just thinking and mulling over my thoughts, mulling over the dream. Through my blinds, I could see that it was morning time, so after a little more time in bed, I decided to get up and start my day. No use waiting for my alarm. After letting my dog out and getting ready for work, I checked my phone and saw that I had indeed been left a voicemail. I told myself I would listen to it after I got off from work. I put my phone in my pocket, said bye to my pup, and left the house.

All day at work, I felt off, like there was a growing anxiety within me, in my core. I work at a warehouse, and my job is to basically stack pallets of product, wrap the pallet in plastic, and get it ready to ship out on a truck. It’s a job that requires some attentiveness. But all day, I was spacing out, having daydreams, almost like I was in an anxious haze, yet I couldn’t pinpoint the source of the anxiety. At lunch, I sat in the cafeteria on-site just staring at my ramen. I was hungry, but I was too caught up in my own head to want to eat.

“You okay there, Chris?” My head shot up to see my manager, John, sitting across the table from me. “You okay, man? You don’t look too good.”

“Yeah, uh… yeah. I’m fine. I-I just didn’t sleep very well yest—last night, I mean. But I’m fine,” I said, nearly stuttering. I could tell that John knew something was up that I wasn’t telling him by the way he looked at me.

“Look, I’m overstaffed today, just not enough freight coming in,” John said. “You look like you could use a day. Plus, it’s Friday. Why don’t you take the rest of the day off?”

I was hesitant to accept; I felt guilty leaving. But John didn’t really phrase it as a question, so I obliged.

When I arrived home, I was greeted by my dog, a pitbull-labrador mutt named Dianna. While I usually reciprocate her greeting, I was in such a daze that I didn’t acknowledge her at all. She immediately could tell something was off about me. She even started acting shady towards me, keeping her distance and side-eyeing me. I was exhausted, so I just went upstairs to bed. It was strange—as I went up my stairs, I couldn’t help but notice that the darker areas of my house were noticeably duller. I collapsed onto my bed with my shoes still on and almost instantly fell into a dreamless sleep. I woke up the next day at 6 AM. I had slept for over 12 hours.

After that, my weekend went fine. Nothing really noteworthy happened, to be honest. I mostly just sat around, and at some point, I wrote down my nightmare in my journal while I watched *Friends*. On Monday, three days after the incident at work, I was leaving work and sitting in my car, about to drive out of the parking lot when I remembered the voicemail. I pulled it up on my phone and listened.

“Hi, Chris. This is Detective Connor Davidson with the Richland Police Department. Do you remember me? I know it’s been... has it been 3 years already? Damn. Anyway, would you mind calling me back when you get this? I have an update. Thanks.”

I was in a little shock. I hadn’t heard Connor’s voice in a long time. Not since I had lived in Richland, Washington, 3 years prior. Not since all those horrible things happened.

Sitting in my car, my mind was reeling after hearing Connor’s voice. I was fixated on the phrase, “I have an update.” Over and over again, it repeated in my mind, and a lump formed in my throat as I pressed the Return Call icon on my phone. The phone rang twice, and then Connor answered.

“Detective Davidson,” he said.

For a second, I didn’t say anything, unsure how to even introduce myself because my brain was so occupied.

“Hello?” Connor broke the awkward silence.

I finally spat something out.

“H-hi, Connor. It’s Chris. Jackson. You called me a couple of days ago. With an update?”

Connor’s voice immediately became friendly and full of recognition.

“Oh, hey man. How’s it going? It’s been a long time.”

“I’m okay,” I said. Connor’s cordialness broke me out of my weird mindset. “It has been a long time. Last we talked, it was Officer Davidson, I believe. You must like the pay raise.”

“Oh yeah, it’s great. I can actually afford my car payment and groceries.”

We both chuckled.

“How do you like being a Detective?” I asked.

“It’s pretty great, to be honest. I basically get paid to write reports and eat donuts at the station,” he said, obviously joking.

“I bet in a town like Richland, there’s not a whole lot of action,” I said with a laugh.

There was silence on his end of the phone after I said that. It seemed I had reminded him of the reason he reached out to me in the first place.

“Have you been keeping up on the news here?” I no longer lived in Richland, so I hadn’t.

“No? What happened?” I asked, but I had a feeling I knew what the news was, praying that I was wrong. Praying that it wasn’t happening again.

“We got him,” he said. “We caught James Reese.”

I was once again in shock. I was speechless. I was wrong. My fear indeed did revolve around James, but that he had resurged and was killing again, not that he had been caught.

Connor continued as I had nothing to say.

“Late last Thursday, a police station in Baker City received an anonymous tip that he was hiding in an abandoned house. They pursued it, and, well, it turned out to be true. They took him into custody Friday morning.”

“Baker City? Like, you mean Oregon?” I asked.

“Of all places,” Connor replied. “The state agreed to extradite him here, to Benton County, for prosecution.”

I still didn't know what to say. I just blurted out the first thing that came to my mind.

“Why?” I said.

“Why?” Connor repeated, as if to say, “What do you mean ‘why?’”

“Why are you telling me this, Connor? I don’t want to know this.”

Connor sighed sympathetically, almost regretfully.

“This case is moving fast. He’s going to appear in court sooner than later. And unfortunately, you’re a key witness to what happened, Chris. It’s more likely than not that you're going to be called on to testify when he is brought before the judge. And seeing that I’ve been made lead investigator on the case, I thought I would give you a heads-up before an attorney did it first.”

Now I understood.

“Thanks,” I said dryly.

We talked for a little longer, catching up and making pleasantries. After we hung up, I just sat in the silence of my car, contemplating and dreading the fact that I was going to have to dig up memories I had worked hard to bury. The skeletons in my closet had been stirred up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I grew up in a small but growing urban town called Richland in the southern region of Washington State, known as the Columbia Basin. Richland sits south of the Columbia River, with its bank running parallel to the town. Richland is actually one of three small cities that are cradled up to the coast. On the north side of the Columbia River is Pasco, which mostly consists of agriculture and farmland with some suburban areas sprinkled in. Then, south of the Columbia, are Kennewick and Richland. The two small cities are separated by a line only visible on a map. Together, all three towns create an area known as the Tri-Cities. When one thinks of Washington State, the first thing that usually comes to mind is a whole ton of evergreen trees.

And for the most part, they’d be right. However, the Tri-Cities breaks that reputation. It is built on a low desert full of sagebrush, treeless hills, and tall dry grass. This is exactly why Oppenheimer and his team chose an area just north of Richland called Hanford to stage the plutonium production for the Manhattan Project. And that’s basically as far as the hometown pride goes.

I’ve actually heard the whole Columbia Basin area referred to as Washington’s asshole. Perhaps that’s also why some people like to call it the Tri-Shitties. I digress. Basically, there isn’t a whole lot to do in that sleepy town. But the main hubs for activity are as follows: The ‘Uptown’ strip mall, best known for the Spudnut Shop where they sell some of the best donuts on the planet; a baseball stadium known as The Dust Devil Stadium, home of— you guessed it— the Tri-City Dust Devils; the Columbia River, where everyone spends their summers either swimming, watching boat races, or running on the trails along the riverside; and lastly, the Columbia Center Mall, which sits almost directly in the middle of all three cities. To be honest, it’s a boring town full of quiet people. That’s probably why I was able to get away with so much as a kid.

I wouldn’t say I was a troublemaker as a child, but I wasn’t what anyone would describe as “quiet.” Neither were my brother, Jessy, and my cousin Isaiah. Isaiah and I were less cousins and more brothers. We were born the same year, although six months apart. We went to school together, church together, lived in the same neighborhood, and spent almost as much time together as Jessy and I did. But we were pretty rambunctious, and when Isaiah and I were together, no one could keep us still, and manners were out the window. Growing up Orthodox Christian, my pias parents and my aunt and uncle had a hell of a time keeping our rowdy nature at bay during church.

For example, one time when Isaiah and I were around five, he snuck his hamster, Hammy, to church. His parents had just gotten it for him for his birthday that past weekend, and he didn’t want to leave without it. But while we were in line to receive communion, Hammy wriggled out of Isaiah's shirt pocket and got loose in the church. There was pandemonium in the chapel; the old ladies and the girls were screaming, and the boys were trying to catch the rodent. Father Andrew was finally able to let Hammy out by opening the doors of the chapel. We thought it was so funny, and Isaiah and I were giggling through the entire ordeal until our parents got ahold of us. Not only did our parents make us apologize to the entire congregation and to Father Andrew, but Isaiah never saw Hammy again.

The summer of 2000 was probably the first time my parents gave me any real freedom. I turned eight in June, and for my birthday, my mom, instead of money in my birthday card, gave me three year-round bus passes for the transit. She told me that one of them was for me and the other two were for Isaiah and Jessy. Basically, I was given full access to transportation around the Tri-Cities. The only restrictions were that I had to tell my mom where I was going and when I would be back, and I had to take Jessy and Isaiah with me, especially Jessy because he was thirteen. In the 90s and early 2000s, the Tri-Cities was considered to be one of the safest places in Washington State, so this wasn’t reckless parenting. And my mom was also well aware that we were going to stick to places like parks, the public pool, the library, and the mall.

I remember that we would get into our swimsuits and hop on the bus heading into the heart of Richland. There was a park right next to the riverside called Howard Amon Park, and it was right down the street from the ‘Uptown.’ When we got off the bus, we’d first pick a spot, a home base as it were, usually a picnic table. We’d throw our backpacks in a pile, strip our shirts off, exposing our ‘white as sour cream’ complexion, and run like the lifeguards from Baywatch into the cold Columbia water. But in the summer heat, it was so refreshing. I remember playing King of the Hill with Isaiah and Jessy, trying to wrestle each other off the dock and making each other do the Truffle Shuffle before jumping into the water. We would walk in the shallower areas looking for small fish and lost change. Once, I even thought I found a skull along the shore, but it was only a large rock that looked like a skull.

Isaiah was really into the summer reading programs the libraries hosted, and so occasionally we would stop at the library. I, however, mostly went for the comic books. Of course, the public pool was a favorite of ours. Although the real reason we went was because the ice cream truck would make a drive by the pool nearly every hour. So between the parks along the river, the library, and the pool, we had our summer regular haunts.

But that all changed when I saw on the TV in our living room that the Columbia Center Mall was hosting Free Ticket Friday at the Regal Cinema. And with the release of Thomas And The Magic Railroad, I HAD to go to the mall. I remember my eight-year-old self feeling like he would combust if I didn’t go. But my dreams were soon crushed when no one would go with me. Jessy didn’t want to sit through a movie he described as “gay as f—k,” and Isaiah obviously couldn’t go if Jessy didn’t. My dad was always at work, so my only hope was my mom.

When I went to my mom, I felt a little like a salesman. She was cleaning dishes at the sink, and I was eating a PB&J she had made me at the counter, and I remember feeling like this was the most important thing to me. “Hey mom,” I said, with some sandwich still in my mouth. She looked over at me, soap still on her hands.

“Have you heard of Free Ticket Friday?” She shook her head. “No, I haven't. What is it?” I had her hooked, so I made my pitch. “It’s this really cool thing at the mall where if you buy one movie ticket, you get one for free. And I was wondering if we could go see the new Thomas movie? Is that okay if we do that?” I said all in one breath.

She looked at me with faux contemplation. “Mhh. Just you and me?” she asked. I nodded. She made a coy face, “Like a mom-son date?” I cringed. “If you wanna call it that, I guess.” My mom snickered. “I’m kidding, kiddo. If you keep your room clean all this week, then I think that's a great idea, hon. We can go this weekend.” I got up from the counter and ran to hug my mom. “Thanks, mom!” I said. She laughed and splashed water on me.

Friday couldn’t have come soon enough, and all week I was thinking about the Thomas movie. When it finally came, I almost pushed my mom out of the house and into the car. It wasn’t a long car ride; we lived within walking distance of the mall, but my childlike impatience made the drive feel like an eternity. When we pulled up to the theater side of the mall, I saw the poster for the Magic Railroad displayed on the outside of the theater, and at that moment, nothing else in the world mattered.

But, even as a child, something about the mall complex felt industrial, almost oppressively so. There was a faint hum of machinery that was ever-present but never really seen. To describe the mall without going into monotonous detail, it’s a single-story and very spread-out building. It’s formed into a shape that resembles a strange letter ‘K.’ And the Regal Cinema was at the top of the ‘K,’ on the north side of the mall.

When we walked into the entrance of the mall that led to the theater, I could see an advertisement poster saying, “Don’t Miss Out On FREE TICKET FRIDAY! It’s BOGO On ALL TICKETS! Happening EVERY FRIDAY! And going ALL! SUMMER! LONG! Only At The Regal Cinema in Columbia Center!” The poster itself seemed a bit off, the colors slightly faded and the edges curling, as if it had been there for much longer than just a summer. Maybe it was just reused from last year.

“Two tickets for Thomas and The Magic Railroad, please,” my mom said once we got to the ticket booth. The attendant typed something on his register. “It’s for Free Ticket Friday,” I blurted out. My mom chuckled, “He knows, sweetheart.” I don’t remember much about the attendant; I think there was a glare or something on the glass at the ticket booth, so I couldn’t get a good look at his face.

He wore a white polo shirt and a black bow tie with black pants, and his name tag, instead of a name, just said “Usher.” Just like the rest of the employees. What differentiated the man selling us tickets was that he had a small pin on his shirt right below the name tag. It was Tinkerbell. I remember it so clearly because after my mom had the tickets and we were about to go inside, I said to him, “I like your Tinkerbell pin.” The man didn’t say anything back to me, though. He just looked at me. Even through the light-polluted glass, I could feel him staring at me as my mom and I went in.

My mom surprised me by getting not only a tub of popcorn for us to share but she let me pick out any candy I wanted from the candy rack, which was considered to be a delicacy by my 8-year-old self. I chose the pack of Twizzlers. The movie was, as I had expected, amazing. While we were walking out of the theater, we passed by the ticket booth and I glanced over to see if the man that sold us our tickets was still there. And he was. He was standing perfectly upright with his arms stiffened and at his sides. He was still looking at me through the glare of the glass, and I felt uncomfortable.

To this day, I don’t know why I did what I did next. I can’t remember what my younger self was thinking, but I waved at him. Maybe it was to break the awkwardness of the situation, or maybe I wasn’t thinking anything at all. It’s not even necessarily that I waved at him, but that he waved back. He lifted his right hand and waved slowly, like how a princess waves. I know that might sound ridiculous, but in hindsight, it was very unsettling.

“You alright, kiddo?” my mom said. I was nearly tripping over myself while my attention was drawn toward the stranger behind the booth, and she had noticed. I snapped out of whatever had me, “Huh? Oh yeah, I’m fine,” I said, not very convincingly. Her parenting sixth sense must have been going haywire because she also looked behind her. After a moment, she turned back around, and we both started walking a little faster out of there.

I think my mom was looking for a way to cheer herself up from that creep looking at us, so she surprised me again when she took me to the Toys “R” Us that shared the parking lot of the mall. I was basically clamoring to get to the train aisle, and once there, my mom let me pick out any train I wanted. After combing through the aisle with the precision of a prison cavity search, I narrowed it down to two. I was torn between the new character from the movie, Lady, and a Thomas train that was completely gold. I decided that the golden Thomas was better than Lady, and I almost left skipping out of the store with my mom.

The next day, I got up particularly early, especially for it being summer. I found my mom making coffee in the kitchen, and for some reason, that morning I really wanted to play in the dirt lot in our backyard. I asked her if she could call my aunt and schedule a playdate with Isaiah so we could play in the dirt. We lived in a new neighborhood, one of the many pop-up homes that had rapidly sprung up because of the rise in people moving to our town—the construction business was booming.

There was a long stretch of dirt behind the line of homes on our block. It was going to be a greenbelt of grass that served as a divider between our neighborhood and the next, but it was unfinished. If you followed the greenbelt to the west, you would eventually end up near the mall. If you followed it east, you would reach a small forest reserve officially named the Amon Basin Preserve, but we called it something else.

Isaiah, some of the other kids on our block, and I would often play in the dirt, digging holes, playing with our construction toys, and in our case, bringing out our Legos so we could play on what we called “realistic terrain.” The best part was, we thought it was so cool. That’s exactly what we did that day. We each brought out our own Star Wars Legos and found a patch of terrain that looked particularly epic for our Lego battle. It was Clones vs. Droids, and I was on the Clone side.

I was digging out a part of the earth that I thought would make a suitable cave for cover when my hand touched something hard in the dirt. This wasn’t out of the ordinary—it was basically an active construction site. I grabbed hold of whatever it was and pulled it out.

“Whoa, what the heck is that, dude?!” Isaiah shouted, shocked by what I held in my hand. I was just as astounded at what I had found. The best I could figure at the time was that it was a weird piece of art that someone had lost. But whatever it was, it was certainly made of bone. It seemed like small animal bones. There were three, what looked like, chicken thigh bones formed into a triangle with twine holding each point together. Two twigs, also tied to the bones, were laid across each other, forming an X over the triangle with a coin attached to the center of the X. Some other twigs and leaves were tied to the artifact, but what intrigued me the most was the coin.

My gaze seemed to be halted not by the coin itself, but by what was inscribed on it. There was a curious symbol on it that I had never seen before, and I was transfixed by it. Since then, I’ve had nightmares revolving around that sigil. “What is that thing?” Isaiah said right behind me, breaking me from the grasp of my own intrigue. He went to grab it, “Well, what is it? Let me see!” he said.

“Too slow!” I said as I yanked it away just as he was about to grasp it. “Hey, no fair, let me see,” he protested.

“Yes, fair,” I said smugly. “It’s in my backyard, so it’s mine, and you can’t see it.” At that moment, I was decidedly being a little shit. I stuffed the totem in my back pocket and insisted we forget about it and keep playing. But I didn’t forget about it at all—it was in the back of my mind the whole time. I wondered who made it, where it came from, and what it meant, all the way up until I landed my head on my pillow that night. Thoughtlessly, I hid it under my bed so Jessy wouldn’t see it and ask me any questions. I don’t know why I was so protective of that piece of junk.

That night, after going to bed with my new Thomas toy, I was stirred awake by a thudding sound. It was rhythmic, ‘thud, thud, thud,’ then it would stop. Again, ‘thud, thud, thud,’ then stop. It repeated like this until I finally woke up. My brother and I shared a room, so assuming it was him, I said his name before my eyes were even fully open.

“Jessy!” I said in a whispered shout.

“What?” he replied. I could tell by his voice that I had just woken him up.

“What are you doing? What’s that sound?” I heard him readjust in his bed to look at me.

“What do you mean, what am I doing? What the hell are you doing?” he said, not whispering anymore.

“What?” I said. I opened my eyes and realized I wasn’t lying in my bed as I had thought. I was actually standing upright in front of our closed bedroom door with my head resting against it. I stood there, confused.

“Chris,” my brother said, “what are you doing?” I didn’t have an answer because I didn’t know.

“I-I don’t know,” I said.

“Stop being weird and go back to bed,” Jessy said as he rolled over. I got back into bed, but I lay awake for a long time.

I began to sleepwalk almost every night from then on. My brother would catch me standing at the door and softly thudding my head against it. After the third night, Jessy told our parents. I honestly think he was scared, and I don’t blame him. My dad didn’t think much of it because, in the beginning, it wasn’t so concerning. But I remember my mom seeming worried, and to be honest, that unsettled me. My nighttime activity only became stranger when I began to speak while I sleepwalked. At first, I was only mumbling, saying unintelligible things.

But one night, about a week after I began to sleepwalk, my mom woke up to what she thought was soft knocking on the front door. Usually, my mom would have my father check on things like nighttime visitors, but he was working an overnight shift that night. So, she got out of bed, put her robe on, and went to check for herself. What she saw shocked and somewhat horrified her. I was standing at the front door, my hand on the knob and softly hitting my head against the door in the same rhythmic fashion as before. But this time, after each repetition of three thuds, I would say quietly, “I have to go now.”

She walked over to me cautiously and caught her breath when she saw my face. My eyes were open wide and wild, with my pupils extremely dilated, leaving only a thin ring of blue around them. She took me by the hand, waking me up and breaking me out of the trance I was seemingly in. I was very confused and clueless, but my mom later admitted to me when I was older that this experience truly disturbed her. This specific behavior repeated multiple times, with either my mom, dad, or Jessy finding me by the door. One of the times Jessy found me, he actually decided to engage with me verbally and ask where I had to go. His account is chilling, to say the least.

He woke up at around 3 in the morning to the now familiar sound of thudding on the front door. He left our room and found me standing, facing the door in the dark. ‘Thud, thud, thud.’ “I have to go now,” I said. By this point, Jessy was used to just waking me up and leading me back to bed.

“Chris,” he said, trying to wake me up, but it didn’t work. ‘Thud, thud, thud.’ “I have to go now,” I repeated.

“Chris,” he said louder. According to Jessy, I then slowly turned to look at him, my eyes dilated and watering as though I had been crying.

“I have to go now, Jessy,” I said in a dreamy voice.

“Where do you have to go?” he asked apprehensively.

“I have to go to Neverland, Jessy. Off to Neverland.” Sufficiently freaked out by that point, Jessy shook me awake.

Jessy said later that I must’ve been having a nightmare because I inhaled dramatically. When I saw that it was Jessy standing next to me, I began to really cry, adding to the idea that I was indeed having a nightmare, although I can’t remember what it was. I collapsed into my brother’s arms, and he hugged me tightly. I was beginning to scare myself. The next day, my parents scheduled an appointment with a sleep specialist, hoping to receive answers about my unconscious behavior that was growing more concerning nearly every night.",0,1727799715.0,nosleep,1,0.5,False

I think it's been 5 years since a conversation that wasn't focused on children.

I MISS them. I miss their personalities before everything got consumed by parenthood. I miss being able to get coffee and chat without a child present. I miss not having to plan my schedule around their hectic lives just to see them for 5 minutes.

But I also miss the fact they used to hide their judgement of non-parents better!

I used to be able to talk about my own life developments without the bitter ""ah yes, well we couldn't do that with [kids' names]"". 
The presumptuous ""you won't be going to concerts once you have kids"" no matter how many times I explain that I'm not having them.
The complete lack of interest in me or my partner or even the basic details of our lives.
My brother, who used to call me the smartest person he knew, asking me what the *point* of my life is if I don't have kids.

I also have narcissist parents who everyone has forgotten are narcs because they love babies so have wormed their way back in.

If I have to hear one more time how ""amazing"" my father has been, from people who know he has been ignoring my calls for an entire year due to my sexual orientation...

Anyway, I'm lonely. I feel like I'm running out of adults to talk to.

Thank you for reading this rant.

I’m trying to make the International Delight Oreo Iced Coffee at home and I’m slowly going insane. I created this recipe from the back of the can:

8 oz coffee
6 oz skip milk
3.5 tbs cane sugar
1 tbs cream
1 tsp pectin
1/4 tsp cocoa powder 
1/4 tsp clear vanilla extract

I’m using Folgers Classic Roast. It’s a medium roast. I’m brewing it hot (perhaps that’s the mistake?) and using a French press. I put all the ingredients in a blender, then I put it in the fridge overnight. I give it one more pulse in the morning before serving it.

It’s really close to the real thing, but there’s a slight bitter taste that I can’t get rid of. Any ideas where I’m going wrong? Should I get different coffee? Buy whole beans and grind them? Brew it differently? I’ve heard that it might be better to keep it in a sealed container after the coffee has brewed—maybe that will work?

Out of the group, five people, aged between 30 and 40, either didn’t know what it was or had only vaguely heard of it but had never used it.

Coming from the tech industry myself, I’m so accustomed to using and sharing these tools with friends and colleagues that it was a bit shocking to realize that people who belong to the digital generation aren’t keeping up with technological advances that could have a significant impact on their lives.

I explained how **ChatGPT** works and even demonstrated how it could create a table in Excel format. They were genuinely impressed. I also introduced them to other AI tools, like one that assigns tasks based on specific goals. The oldest member of the group was particularly impressed since he had a goal to move up in his company, and the tool provided tailored advice and tasks for his situation.

While I understand that we can’t always be aware of every new innovation, I still find it surprising that there are people in the digital age who don’t know or use these tools.

-go to a pumpkin patch

-go to a local football game 

-buy a new candle or decoration 

-go for a hike 

-draw up unique designs for your future Jack o lanterns 

-google real leaves and create paper leaf decor for your window 

-look up festivities in your area, like Halloween themed nights at a local expo 

-window shop decor

-make a list of your favorite Halloween/festive movies and watch one every night or every other night. It’s fun to look forward to! 

-think of ways to make your normal routine a little special. Like buy the caramel flavored coffee just for October, or put pumpkin spice into your oatmeal, etc. 

-go apple picking (this is the one food exception) 

-go to a haunted house 

-corn maze 

-petting zoo 

-Halloween club/party/dance 

-make fall-colored scarves, socks, hats, and mittens for the local shelter 

-do a simmer pot on the stove with some cinnamon sticks, clove, etc 

-buy a festive clothing item you can only wear in October. It can be a cute dress or even some socks, but it’s something to look forward to! 

I know these things don’t replace those delicious treats, and moderation can help. But if you have an SO and go on dates a lot, or family visiting, it can be so helpful to remember that there are plenty of other things to do that don’t involve food. Happy haunting, y’all!

My weight was measured at 173.6lbs, pre diabetic, high blood pressure and other not so good results etc. I am 40yrs old turning 41yrs old this October 9.

So far I lost 18lbs, all I did is walking and last August I started 2 meals a day, last meal is between 6-7pm. I concentrated my effort on building the habit of walking from 10-12k to now 20k per day I am now confident the walking will be part my life, after coffee in the morning I walk, after lunch I walk, after dinner I walked.

Here is the data, from Dec 2023 to Oct ave daily
Dec 2023 173.6lbs
Jan 2024 168.4lbs
Feb 2024 166.7lbs
Mar 2024 169lbs
April 2024 168.6lbs
May 2024 169.5lbs
June 2024 168.5lbs
July 2024 168.7lbs
August 2024 163.2lbs
Sept 2024 157.1lbs
Oct 2024 155.4lbs

- my estimate by Dec or Jan 2025 I will hit the target

 - my blood pressure is almost normal 123/77, I think when I hit may 145lbs goal it will be normal already.

Diet - rice is non negotiable, I need my rice. 1-2 cups on lunch, 1 cup dinner. I also have 1 glass of coke zero each meal, ice cream every weekend - small size 140cal 8grams of sugar. My snack is mixed nuts or home made beef jerky should be eaten between 12nn to 4pm, I measure the nuts since I have tendency to overeat - 30grams only for 170 cals.

Now my questions are, I have not incorporated resistance training and I am now thinking to start, walking habit is there, started the 2 meal plan, for some reason my weight was stagnat feb to july but I got slimmer and my clothes have gone down from large to medium- i can get away with small but its to slim fit for me.

1. Will adding resistance resistance training increase my appetite? I Only eat 1.5 meals a day, full meal during lunch and half meal during dinner. I dont want to change anything as I only started the diet Aug if it will increase my appetite or I will get hundry after workout

2. In case I will start resistance training, should I continue first to walk and diet drop to 140lbs and then start resistance training to be on my target weight to 145lbs- i can eat more if this will be my approach add 5lbs of lean muscle for the next 3-6months

I was furious, hurt, everything. But he sent her a message saying that they wouldn’t meet again, and promised to take therapy more seriously. So I gave him another chance. 

The next weekend I woke up to a message from AP, basically telling me that I should give up, their love is too strong. WH told her to stop, and later that day I received another message where she accused me of using the kids to keep my husband hostage (!!). I was furious. But what was worse was that he defended her, saying that she’s hurt and desperate. She also sent a message to his parents telling them that she’s worried about him (probably because of me). She also told him that she tried to commit suicide and was committed to a psychiatric hospital for a while. This made me worried and afraid, but instead of supporting me, he defended her again. 

He’s had some breakthrough in therapy, which explains some of his actions, but right now I’m not sure I’m here for it. I think he still loves her and wants to go back to the craziness that made him leave her in the first place (we were separated while he pursued a relationship with her, it didn’t last long). 

He says he loves me, but that he’s struggling to stay away when she contacts him (she always finds a way to work around blocking etc. even showed up at his job). So he didn’t really let her go. 

We should probably have stayed separated longer, but I can’t change that now. I would hate to tell the kids that we’re breaking up again, but do I have a choice? Or should I be more patient and see what therapy leads to?",6,1727799243.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,8,1.0,False

The room was different. The walls were clean, still there were no doors or windows, just a table in the corner of the room. On the wall hung a small oval shaped mirror, where Sand was now standing, combing his hair.

""How?"" James shuddered as the words left his lips. He took a deep breath and calmed himself. He looked up and saw the vast, dark emptiness above him. He was here again, but this time there was less panic.

""Are you asking me how?"" Sand turned and walked to his seat at the table. ""'How' is very vague, James.""

""I think you know what I meant. What am I doing here?""

""Why don't you sit down and have some coffee."" Sand gestured to the steaming mug across the table. James had a moment where the room began to blink. As if he was closing his eyes, he could see the cold burnt walls without a mirror.

""You think it would calm me down?"" James pulled the chair out from under the table. He looked at the hardwood floor to see a polished floor with no dust. ""I like what you have done with the place.""

""It is fitting for a game of chess, no?"" Sand smiled. In the center of the table set a glass chess board. It was crystal clear with some smokey, translucent squares and pieces, while others were as clear as a window.

""I see. I get to go first?"" James put the tips of his fingers on a pawn and pressed one hand against his mouth. James stared at Sand, waiting for him to look up through his sunglasses.

""Where do you think you are going to go from here?"" Sand was still looking at the chess pieces, waiting for James to make the first move.

""Probably D4."" James said moving his pawn to the desired space. ""I guess I am dead?""

""How would I know? The game just started."" Sand moved his pawn as well, never looking up from the board. James grabbed the mug from the table and pressed it to his lips. Something inside him prepared himself to relax. He knew if he had a drink that it could help calm his nerves, but the taste struck him differently this time.

""Wait, there is no bourbon."" James was shocked to see that he was drinking regular coffee. With a puzzled look on his face, James hunched down to try and draw Sand's attention away from the game board. ""It's just coffee?""

""Did you expect something else?"" Sand finally looked up, but his sunglasses seemed darker. There were no signs of eyes behind those glasses, just emptiness. The look sent chills down James' spine.

""Did they both pass..."" James started to ask the only question that could come to his mind, but before he could get the words out the room started to 'blink' again. He could see the old room again, dirt floors and burnt walls. He could feel the fear of that room scurry inside of him. He felt the weight that room brought him. Aggressively, James shook his head and rubbed his eyes.

""It's your turn."" Sand said in a hush tone.

""I am sorry, I can't... I can't breathe."" James started to gasp for air as he fell from the chair. He could feel his lungs collapsing as he grabbed his chest, now rolling onto his back. He saw Sand in his peripherals, he was now leaned back in his seat holding his cup of coffee. James could only look at one thing, the vast nothingness above him had something new. In the dead center of the black wall above him was a bright dot. It glistened like a small crystal chess piece in the sky. He was so fixated on the bright star that he didn't realize he could breath again. It was the most alluring feeling he had ever had. In that moment he felt truly alone. Had he ever loved anything? Did he deserve to be here? Is this the karma he had created? Was he even really here? How could this be the end of his existence? What would happen if he just laid here forever? What if he closed his eyes and slept? Would Sand still be here when he woke? His mind slowly came back to reality as he focused on the twinkle of light above him.

""A star?"" James muttered from his back.

I own a very small time coffee trailer and have been using Lavazza Decaf. 
Does anyone have any recommendations for a really good, smooth and not bitter decaf? I wouldn’t use a lot and my own supplier has a minimum of 10 bags of beans so I want to buy small lots for freshness. Ground preferably as I don’t want to buy another grinder just for decaf.

I come from an abusive household who had drunk serial womaniser father 
My views on marriage, relationships were flawed and I believed hookup culture was the right way to live since Hey everyone cheats anyways why not live like this ( I haven't started live like this yet just dreaming)

I have been keeping this perspective for years ( 7 years ) 

When I got my first job I was excited for both Newfound office , money and friends 

Among that was a cute girl taller , more athletic than me , I felt a crush my I brushed it off as infatuation. When we were discussing our views and plans for future she'd describe having multiple kids and perfect family!

At first mocked her and told her the pleasures of living care free , she immediately started preaching how fulfilling a family life would be eventually little by little I fell for that dream and the girl 

1. We used to hold hands ( FOR A VERY LONG TIME ) , have coffee together 

2. She would look at me differently

NOW COMES THE TWIST !

Im extremely good at my job it's the only good thing in life 
It takes me only a few seconds to fix a bug or 1-2 hrs to develop features 

BUT THE GIRL was weak in it , she was recommended to the company through a family friend of the SENIOR MANAGER so she really sucks at COMP SCI

Naturally I became her sole tutor for free , coaching her day and night 
Solving her doubts and pretty much helping her pass all the exams 

What kept bugging me was that she'd so stupid which is not expected of a mechanical engineer whom she was I was always sceptical and passed it as maybe she is actually naive 



TODAY I PROPOSED TO HER WITH FLOWERS IN CAFE And she 
Said she never SAW me like a lover 
And Her parents have certain views on what her husband should be like 
Even though I promised to do anything to impress her dad 
She subtly started dropping hints about Her MOTHER'S FRIEND'S SON who works in USA and settled there having an intrest in her and she said she is OK OK with him

She is from a upper middle class family with strong family oriented backgrounds 

She DID NOT SAY NO to me but indirectly she pointed out the reasons 

WHEN I LOOK BACK I FINALLY UNDERSTOOD SHE WAS JUST USING ME TO CLIMB THE CORPORATE LADDER AND I FELL FOR THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK !

I FEEL EMPTY , BETRAYED AND DISGUSTED WITH MYSELF

1ftrvk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ftrvk3/waitah_if_i_asked_my_son_to_talk_more/,WAITAH if I asked my son to talk more responsibility? ,"My son finally came back from the psych ward. According to his doctor, he was close to severe burnout. The whole situation was incredibly stressful, and it brought back terrible memories of the stunts his mother used to pull.

The whole ""I'm having a breakdown"" act—it was right out of her playbook. He just up and left the kids, which is exactly what he constantly complains that I did.

While he was gone, the kids seemed happier. There was no stress over food, homework, chores, or anything like that. They were finally having fun, just being kids without the weight of his mood hanging over them.

When Nick came back, he spent his first day sleeping. He didn’t make dinner, didn’t say hi to the kids, didn’t do anything. He ordered lunch and dinner for himself but didn’t bother to get any for me or his siblings.

Then on Tuesday, he started yelling at me about not taking care of his grandmother the way he normally does. Nick usually takes her for walks, feeds her, handles her medication, and bathes her. But I had no idea she was in bad shape. When I tried to explain, it turned into another fight. His younger siblings came downstairs, and thankfully, they came to my defense.

Regrettably, I told him, ""See? The kids are happier under my care. You keep calling me incompetent, but it’s clear they like me better. They’re my kids.""

He just sighed and said, ""You know what? I’m done. You say the kids are happier without me? You think you can handle it all? Fine. Handle it. I’m too young for this shit. Have fun. And by the way, I was your kid too.""

Ever since then, he’s abandoned the kids again. He still lives in the house but doesn’t do anything. For example, the other day I forgot to pick up groceries for breakfast. The kids had to eat toast with butter, and all they did was complain. Meanwhile, Nick just sat there on the couch, drinking his coffee, saying, ""I normally do the grocery shopping on Sundays,"" and walked away smugly.

Or the other day, he was taking a bubble bath, but one of my sons (M13) needed his laundry done. Nick just said, ""You can ask your dad,"" and went back to his bath.

He won’t help with the kids' homework, and the only chores he does are cleaning up after himself when he cooks or uses a plate. He only helps Cole (M17).

Nick isn’t acting like himself. On Saturday, he came home after hours of being gone, not answering his phone. He stumbled in, drunk, with two friends practically carrying him. They didn’t even apologize. They just dropped him on the couch. I didn’t even know he had close friends.

He’s being completely irresponsible. He doesn’t do anything around the house, and it’s starting to fall apart. The kids don’t listen to me, and it’s all so overwhelming.

He doesn’t even take care of his grandmother anymore. How do I talk to him about taking more responsibility? I feel like I’m drowning even my girlfriend feels overwhelmed. I just don't understand how he would constantly brag and complain about having custody over the kids and now he just gave up. 


Edit to add; his behaviour is so scarily like his mother. ",4,1727799020.0,AITAH,15,1.0,False

Last summer when we camped through Banff (Canada) we bought instant and heated up water in the mornings. We also grabbed a a bottle of iced coffee for the mornings we were early on the go.

1ftrsal,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1ftrsal/omg_yall_im_having_embarrassing_personal_issues/,Omg y’all I’m having embarrassing personal issues and I need advice… TMI warning,"


A couple of things. Which I can literally talk to no one else about because no one would understand. 


Okay. Issue number one. I have a real bad case of dermatillomania, where I compulsively pick at the acne on my face and nose. During my period, my acne flares up and if I look at the mirror, I get sucked into picking and can’t stop. I’m a 30’s-yo woman who has the complexion of a middle schooler because I can’t get myself to stop picking and making new scabs and red marks. To not do it, I literally have to avoid the mirror, which then also sucks because if I avoid it too much then I lose control of my eyebrows, forget to manage my nose hairs, I don’t put on makeup… idk which is worse? Using the mirror and compulsively picking at my skin or avoiding it??? Does anyone else have this trouble and how do you handle it? Any good solutions for acne? Feel like I’ve tried everything over the years but the only thing that works is not touching my skin (which only happens if I avoid the mirror!!!)

Issue 2. This one is even more embarrassing. 

I work early mornings and, as people do, drink coffee to get my brain awake and make me halfway competent so early in the day. Coincidentally, my daily #2 happens in the morning (sometimes a couple times). I unavoidably stink up the bathroom, which is shared and has stalls and all that. I’m pretty sure I’m developing a reputation for bathroom stink… and yesterday someone “was trying to be nice so didn’t say anything” (but saying *THAT* was mean in itself! I mean, fr, couldn’t you just literally say nothing?! That’s what I do when someone else stinks up the restroom!!) 

So naturally, I’m embarrassed af and have zero social grace so I have no idea how to eloquently handle this awkward af social situation. Everybody poops, right? So why are people mean about it? I can’t change my shift, I can’t exactly change my caffeine routine, and I guess I could change my eating schedule but I need to eat something at work and I’m on a pretty regular 24-hr cycle so wtf do I do?!

Legit makes me want to find a work from home job so I never have to face anyone with my red raw Rudolph nose or my stink butt ever again. Am I the only person on the planet with these problems?!! 


Lastly. Why do people make comments about EVERYTHING?! I can’t even be cold and put on a hoodie without someone commenting that it’s not cold enough for a hoodie. Excuse me? Why tf are my issues everyone else’s business, when I don’t ever say a word about what anyone else is doing? 

Ugh. I guess being able to vent is helpful but if anyone has ANY input for any of this, I’d be most grateful. TIA and sorry for TMI ☹️",3,1727798817.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

Accidentally recycled a $200 piece of my medical equipment: “I’ll just call the company, they’ll replace it.” Until I found it not-yet taken by the truck, and my legs turned into jelly. 

Left the stove on all day, until my housemate texted me and the other girl we lived with: “I’m so sorry, thank God nothing happened, I will absolutely make extra sure to double-check from now on.” 

But this last one….It happened yesterday, and I  don’t know how much is the right level of freak-out. I almost _burned the house down_, and I’m swinging back and forth between “shit shit shit shit shit” and “everyone makes mistakes”. Because there’s nowhere for me to go if I don’t think that, there’s no way to make it better.

My roommates (neither have ADHD) and I have communication issues, and I dug the stupid hole deeper with one of them when she didn’t come home at all last night and I sent her a joke text threatening to water her plants, a reference to watering them for her in the past (“proof of life or the plant gets it 🪴💦🔫”). I followed it up with a slightly more serious one saying jk just checking in.  I was worried (with decent reason to be, she has a history of mental and physical health things), and trying to cover it with smart-assery….

Well she’s totally fine and during the ten seconds I saw her at work she didn’t make eye contact at all, nor did she answer the very, very stupid text. And I’m just now realizing that maybe I didn’t read the fucking writing on the wall: she’s pissed at me and needs space to cool off. 

I feel like a bull in a china shop. Like I wreck everything I touch. I know it’s catastrophic thinking, but damn I’m just floundering right now. ",3,1727798421.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

I didn't think much of it, until I went to make my morning espresso and I smelled burning and more popping coming from the coffee maker. I instantly unplugged the maker, but the smell of wires/plastic burning remained. 

After doing some looking the GFCI had NOT been triggered on the outlet BUT the breaker for the outlet HAD been tripped, I flipped it back on and it stayed on. 

I then moved the coffee maker to a different outlet in my kitchen and its been brewing coffee like normal, no popping, no burning smell. 

This makes me think the issue is with the outlet NOT the coffee maker, any idea what it could be? Bad GFCI, outlet, or something worse with the breakers?

1ftraou,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaydads/comments/1ftraou/surrogacy_experience_in_mexico_city/,Surrogacy experience in Mexico City,"Now that we're finally back in the US, I thought it'd be helpful to write a post not just about our experience, but focusing on the exit process.  To be honest, we found that our consultant was less than helpful about what exactly happens after birth, leaving us anxious and confused.  Not to be overly dramatic, but the whole reason we spent $6000 hiring a third-party consultant was so that we had some independent expertise and someone to call for help.  He ghosted us for over a week after birth, and after a single short phone call, never got back to us or checked in since.  Save your money, and deal directly with your surrogacy program.  Normal disclosures: YMMV.  This will be the process we experienced, but both Mexican and US government procedures can change at any time.

We had a great experience with our in-country surrogacy agency. They did everything they said they would.  We experienced great communication from our first visit, through the weeks after birth.  Once in-country, they set up a whatsapp group with the medical staff, our coordinator, and the surrogate's social worker.  During birth and until discharge, our coordinator was with us the whole time at the hospital, and best we could tell, our surrogate was also well taken care of by the social worker assigned to her.

Unfortunately, after that is where things went sideways.  We were told to expect it to take 1-2 weeks to get the Mexican birth certificate, and 3-4 weeks to get an approved CRBA + emergency passport from the US embassy.  This is not the reality.

**Getting the Birth Certificate**

There are two ways to get a birth certificate in Mexico City: with or without the surrogate.  

With the surrogate, it is a very fast process.  The bio dad simply goes to the civil registration office with the baby and surrogate, and you are registered.  The birth certificate will list the surrogate as the mother, bio dad as the father, and *there is no current legal process to change this*.  The surrogate will then have to go with you to the embassy and be part of the process, since she is legally the mother under Mexican law.  You will then have to go through a step-parent adoption in the US to remove her parental rights, which will also go most smoothly with the surrogate's continued cooperation.  This is risky, and some surrogates may simply decide they do not want to have any legal ties to the child; after pregnancy and birth, they will want to quickly get back to their normal lives.

Without the surrogate, the IPs must file an Amparo with the court.  They goal is to obtain what is essentially an injunction ordering the civil registration office to register the birth of the child in the IPs name(s).  The full process will take many months, but the injunction can usually be obtained in 3-7 weeks.  Why the variance? Like at home, when you file a case it is randomly assigned to a judge.  Some judges are favorable to surrogacy and will issue an injunction quite quickly.  Others are not, and will do everything possible to delay the process.

1. You will ask the civil registration office for an appointment to register your baby, born via advanced reproductive technology.  Your lawyer should provide the language to use.
2. In a few days, you will get an appointment, but will also be told that you will need a court order.
3. You will then need to verify and sign all the necessary documents for the Amparo, which will be filed as soon as the surrogate also signs.
4. In about a week, the case will be assigned to a court.
5. The court will ask the registration office why they have denied the rights of your child (to be registered).
6. The registration office will issue a standard response that they have no regulations to deal with ART.
7. At this point, ""good"" judges will issue the injunction, and off you go to the civil registration office.
8. You may be required to go to court (together with the surrogate) to ""prove"" your signatures so as to verify that the surrogacy contract is genuine and taken under the free will of everyone involved.
9. You may be required to undergo DNA testing to prove that the surrogate has no genetic relationship to the child, and instead the bio dad is the genetic father.
10. Rarely, this has required court appeals, so it's a risk to know about.
11. The courts will go on vacation twice a year for alternating 15-day periods in the summer and around Christmas.  Obviously, timing the birth is not a thing... it happens 9 months after successful implantation.  But, again, a potential source of delay to be aware of.  If you run into the vacation period, it may be beneficial to wait to file the Amparo until the ""bad"" judges are on vacation.

Bottom line: you are dealing with a process that may be as short as 3 weeks or as long as 2 months, so plan accordingly.  Thankfully, we got a ""good"" judge and had our birth certificate just 3 weeks after birth.  KNOW THAT THIS IS FAST!  To their credit, our lawyers understood that we had not come prepared to stay in Mexico as long as is really needed, and moved heaven and earth to speed things through as best they could. Once registered, you can get an online certified copy from the Mexican government's website for only MX$90.  Just print it out on card stock at a stationary store, and while you're at it, print some extras.

**Getting out of Mexico - the US Embassy**

Since surrogacy is not actually a well-regulated process in Mexico (in fact, it is not regulated at all), the US Embassy does not have easy procedures in place to deal with the many surrogacy cases they see.  For your own sanity, you should get your own DNA testing done.  If the surrogate is willing, you can do this before birth.  Otherwise, it is easy enough to use a mail-order testing kit.  Just as in the US, reputable agencies have thorough procedures in place to avoid mix-ups with IVF.  Just as in the US, there are rare cases where problems have happened.  If you are NOT the bio dad, you can exit the country... however, you MUST use the adoption process, as the US Embassy will only approve CRBA applications of children that have 13 American chromosomes.

As I write this, the Embassy's website still does not have clear procedures, so here's what we had to do:

Gather documents -- before you leave for Mexico!

1. If you are married, and both are US citizens, you must bring proof that both of you have been physically present at some point in your adult lives.  This should be either W2s, work contracts, school transcripts, or some other documentation that firmly establishes you have been in the country.  Rental agreements or property records don't count, because you could theoretically be abroad while renting a place in the US.  Social security statements are less preferred, because you may have earned money working abroad for a US employer.  Remember, the presumption for basically all US citizenship or immigration cases is that the applicant is not eligible; you must convince the officer that you are entitled to citizenship for your child.
2. Depending on other family situations (i.e., single, not married, or if both are not US citizens), you may need to provide documentation that you have been physically present in the US over the course of as many as five years.  DON'T CUT IT SHORT.  Did you go on an international vacation?  Then your W2 doesn't really mean you were present for a full year.  There is no such thing as bringing too much proof of physical presence.
3. Bring official/certified copies of any applicable documents.
4. Be sure to bring basic vital statistics stuff: you will have your passports, but it cannot hurt to also bring your birth certificate (if born in the US) or certificate of naturalization (if not).  If married, bring your marriage certificate (the official one from your state of residence).
5. Make copies of everything.  The embassy will want to see the original, but keep a copy.  Yes, you can make copies and print stuff in Mexico City.  Obviously.  But why not come prepared?
6. For the CRBA (Consular Report of Birth Abroad), you will need to fill out a form stating every period of time you were physically present in the United States since your birth.  If you are like us, you have traveled a LOT.  Come prepared with the dates.  Do your best to remember.  They aren't going to deny your application if you forgot exactly when you came back from vacation 10 years ago.  They will create problems if you claim that you have never left the country in your life.  I mean, if this is really you, be prepared to explain why you were comfortable living in Mexico for a few months having never before been outside the US.
7. While your Mexican lawyers should provide copies of all of the relevant contracts related to the surrogacy, bring copies yourself just in case.
8. You should buy a return ticket to avoid any issues with Mexican immigration.  Just buy a refundable (full-fare) ticket, so you can change it as may be needed.  It's unlikely you'll actually return on the date that you bought the ticket for.  But, bring copies of your itinerary anyway.
9. Oh, and bring some passport photos of yourself.  Or, at least, of the bio-dad.  You will need them for DNA testing.  Yes, you can get these in Mexico if you prefer.  I mean, you'll need to get photos of the baby.

Navigating the eCRBA

1. The embassy's website says that DNA testing is not required.  Let me say this quite clearly: Your CRBA will NOT be approved without DNA testing.  Period.  Also, and let me be clear on this as well: you MUST use the embassy's DNA testing process.  Get your own done so you are confident of the results, but understand that an important part of speeding your exit will be to expeditiously get the embassy's DNA test.
2. You can -- and should -- make your [travel.gov](http://travel.gov) account and start filling out your eCRBA as soon as you know when you'll be traveling for the birth.  Or earlier.  If you've traveled abroad a lot, it will be helpful to do this when you are at home and can look at old passports, etc., to get the dates when physically present in the US.
3. For the child's name, please know that if you will be using the surrogate to register the birth, the last name will follow standard latino names: FirstName MiddleName Patronym Matronym.  If you use the Amparo process, you can basically pick your own name, within reason.
4. While nothing online will tell you this, it's not actually critical to know the child's birth date before filing the eCRBA.  What **is** critical is that you file it early.  Why?
5. Contact your preferred AABB-accredited DNA testing lab, tell them you are doing surrogacy.  You can do this as far in advance as you'd like, but be sure that they **do not send the testing kit before you file your eCRBA**.  If you send it too early, the embassy will throw it out, and you will have to pay the lab additional fees to fedex another test kit.
6. So you have filed your eCRBA.  You've had the testing kit mailed.  The US Embassy in Mexico City usually has appointments roughly 4-6 weeks out.  Feel free to schedule your appointment based on expectations of when you will have your birth certificate.  On this point, the embassy's website is clear and correct: you cannot do anything without the Mexican birth certificate.
7. Your lawyer should know shortly after filing the Amparo if you have a ""good"" or ""bad"" judge, and you absolutely should curate your embassy appointment accordingly.  You do not want to wait until the last minute only to realize that you must reschedule because you don't have the birth certificate as soon as you hoped.  CRBA appointments cannot be expedited unless there is a life or death emergency (e.g., baby's grandfather is in hospital about to die and you can provide proof of this).
8. Once your DNA test kit has arrived in Mexico City you will get an email from the embassy inviting you to schedule your DNA test.  When we were there, they only took DNA samples on Wednesdays.  Also, do not schedule your DNA test until you have the Mexican birth certificate (notice a theme?).
9. It's ok if you have your embassy appointment before your DNA test, or before your DNA test results are back.  Just understand that you are not leaving Mexico until both happen.
10. What to do if you've been conservative in your scheduling and everything happens faster than you expected?  Well, just check 5-6 times a day, morning, afternoon, and night, for any earlier appointments.  Life happens, and sometimes people have to reschedule.  Or, the embassy has more staff than expected, so they open more appointments.  This is how we ended up getting a CRBA appointment just a week after we got the birth certificate.
11. While you wait, prepare the passport application.  Getting good baby passport photos is hard.  But, Mexicans love babies and will work with you at a photo shop to make it happen.  Just be clear that you need US passport size, as this is different than the Mexican passport size they will be used to.  Get extra photos, as you will need them for any DNA tests you may need (either for the Amparo or the US Embassy process).
12. Plan your exit.  DNA testing should only really take a week or so after the sample has been taken.  It is fedexed to the US, and you've paid extra for priority processing at your lab (right?). If have been able to get this done before your CRBA appointment, you can expect a same-day passport.  Theoretically, you could leave the day after your CRBA appointment!  Otherwise, know that it may take a day or two after the Embassy gets your results to actually issue your child's emergency passport.  Emergency passports are usually ready for pick up at 3pm every afternoon.  Most flights back to the US are in the morning.

Navigating the US Embassy

1. You should arrive early, but not too early.  Fifteen minutes before your appointment (either for DNA testing or the CRBA) is adequate -- and they may not let you in earlier.  There is a separate line for US citizens that is shorter and faster than Mexicans applying for Visas.  Just ask the guards where to go or look for the sign that says ""passports.""
2. For your CRBA appointment, a staff member will check all your documents outside.  Be sure you have ready:
   1. Your passport application, printed with a legible bar code, but not signed (remember to enter 000-00-0000 as the SSN).
   2. Passport photos for the baby.
   3. A copy of flight itineraries to prove that you are in need of an emergency passport -- this should include the actual ticket number so they know it isn't just a reservation you made and cancelled, but an actual purchased flight.
   4. Copies of the basic documents: Baby's birth certificate, your passports.
   5. A printed and signed statement (available from the embassy's website) that says your child has not been issued a social security number.
   6. They put things in the preferred order, paper clip it all together, and give you a ticket that you will give the guard to let you in.
3. For your DNA appointment, you may go right to the ""passports"" entrance.  Just make sure you have with you:
   1. Mexican birth certificate for the baby
   2. Passport of bio dad
   3. Passport-size photos of bio dad and baby (bring two)
   4. A bottle for the baby, because s/he will prolly be hungry by the time the test is done, and they are happy to let you feed him/her right after the DNA swab.
   5. For your convenience, there are several nearby starbucks (we liked the one right across Reforma from the embassy).  Enjoy your coffee post-test, and know that you are almost done!
4. By all means, bring your cell phones with you.  You will need to turn them off and leave them at Embassy security.  The admonishments to leave all electronics at home are really for non-citizens, as they don't have the space to store everyone's cell phone.  Embassy staff know that you need navigation/uber if you don't live in Mexico.  If you are coming during the rainy season, they'll also keep your umbrellas at security.
5. For the CRBA, your appointment time should be viewed as more of an admission ticket.  It will take several hours.  Understand that your officer will be reviewing all the documents and doing a background check before actually calling you up to the counter for the interview.  Be prepared to taste any water or formula you are bringing.  If you have other kids, you can bring food for them, but be prepared to taste it.  Adults are expected to just wait it out.
6. You will be going through TSA-like security.  Large bassinets won't fit, but smaller ones will.  Just know that everything will have to go through the x-ray machine.  The staff are a lot nicer than the TSA, and will guide you through what you need to do, so just listen to their instructions.
7. For the CRBA appointment, the officer will review the key documents you've brought, swear you in, and ask some basic questions about you and your life to try and make sure everything is genuine.  For example, she asks for your proof of physical presence and you hand her a W2. The officer might ask, ""what do you do for a living?""  You presented your marriage certificate: ""how did you meet?"" No need to overshare (the officer doesn't want to spend all day on this), but never lie. For example, if you've changed jobs since that particular W2, just say so.  Yes, they have heard of grindr, so if that's how you met, just say so.
8. If you have the CRBA appointment before DNA testing is done, tell the officer where you are in that process -- maybe you already have the DNA appointment scheduled, or maybe you are waiting for the results.  If you've already done the DNA testing, the officer will already have your results.
9. Either way, ask about paying the waybill to ship your CRBA.  Your CRBA will be printed in the US, mailed to Mexico, and then shipped to your address in the US (don't ask).  If you don't have a waybill paid for shipping, it will delay things.  There is a DHL office in the embassy you can use.  Don't worry if this is something you forget about -- the embassy will send you an email explaining how to buy DHL shipping (just make sure that if you are already in the US, you buy it using the US DHL website, not the Mexican one.  You'll have issues paying with a US credit card on the DHL MX website).

A side note about scheduling your CRBA appointment: you don't really have to do the process in Mexico City even if that's where your baby was born.  If you have friends in (wherever) and you prefer to wait it out somewhere else, you can absolutely schedule it elsewhere.  Certain consulates (usually the ones on the border) have shorter wait times for CRBA appointments.  Just know that you should arrange DNA testing at the same consulate that has your CRBA appointment.  We heard rumors that some consulates may not actually require DNA testing if you have other medical documents to demonstrate genetic affinity (e.g., IVF transfer declaration).  YMMV.  Personally, I don't think it's worth moving yourselves and a newborn baby across Mexico just in the hope of maybe not needing DNA testing.  Mexico City is not really a bad place to be trapped for a few months.  The same cannot be said of certain other cities that host US consulates.

**Welcome back to the US!**

1. You can and should apply for your child's social security number as soon as you get home.
2. The emergency passport will **NOT** be accepted by Social Security offices as proof of citizenship of your child.
3. Get NEW passport photos for your baby.  Use the state department's online form generator to make the special application form to exchange an emergency passport.
4. You'll need another copy of that ""we don't have an SSN"" statement.
5. You should also print out and sign a ""file search"" form (just google it).  It will take a while to actually get the physical CRBA, and you otherwise have no other proof of your baby's US citizenship.  There is no extra fee for this, as the record of the approved CRBA will be electronic.
6. Technically, there is no fee for the ""full validity"" passport, but you'll probably want to pay for expedited process to get the social security application started sooner rather than later.
7. Expect that the Social Security Administration will need to translate the Mexican birth certificate, so it won't be processed immediately.
8. Your baby is also a Mexican citizen.  You are entitled to a Mexican passport for your baby, and your local Mexican consulate has friendly staff who can help you with this.  In our global world, dual citizenship is an asset.",8,1727797558.0,gaydads,1,0.9,False

- Home base to explore Kyushu

- Can day trip to Hiroshima/Miyajima

- Lots of nearby Ryokan options

- Closer to Tokyo with train.

- Can day trip to Shirakawa-go

- Can still go to Hakone which I really want to revisit this trip if possible (by going back to Tokyo first)

When I was hired, my boss did say that there will be people on the team I don't get along with (that's a given), but the issue is that these people are on the upper echelon of staff (so they are managers and shift leaders). 

They do NOT respect me at all. I don't why. I don't know what I did to them, but they have slowly given me the cold shoulder as of late. 

One of the biggest issues is when they place me on front counter. The bias is absolutely insane. I run out of coffee and I am literally tasked to go remake coffee when I run out. I only go back once I helped everyone, OR when several customers need coffee ASAP (they gotta go to work). Yet whenever I go back for coffee, the shift leaders get pissed off and tell me to stay in the front. Like dude, Y'ALL taught me to go get coffee DAY ONE OF WORK. Why all of the sudden get mad? Nobody is even at the register and NOBODY was getting me coffee when I asked multiple times! You expect me to just drift around in front of customers as they need drinks? I'm getting flamed for that, yet when I do my job I also get flamed. It's a lose lose. Either I do my job and get shunned by the staff, or I don't do much and customers act like I'm lazy.

Oh but wait, there's more! When I am on cleaning duty for the day, sometimes customers will tell me ""I have been waiting on X desert item for 10+ minutes and have not got it!"" I tell them I'll go get it. I go back to the desert section: NOBODY is there! I already cleaned up messes and everyone else wants to act oh too busy, so I go ahead and make the treats for the customers. Ohhhh but then all of the sudden that's when the shift leaders have free time and they get mad and boot me off deserts. They will act like I spilled ice cream everywhere or something, but then they will take another 5+ minutes to actually finish one damn milkshake! Of course the customers get mad AT ME for not having their shake, although *sometimes* they understand... sometimes... as in 1/10 of the time.

Now this last reason is going to make me sound like a jerk, but hear me out. For some darn reason, my hiring manager hired WAY too many workers and scheduled them all on the same days, so we had very high labor. Guess who had their hours cut and struggled to get anymore... ME! I need the money dude! I'm in college and I have to pay three huge bills every month. At least 1K is out the window every month, dawg. I can't be doing this inconsistent tango.

1ftr15z,https://www.reddit.com/r/waiting_to_try/comments/1ftr15z/alcohol_and_wtt/,Alcohol and WTT,"My husband and I plan to start TTC late April/early May, so I am counting January 1 as my starting line for getting (even more) serious about egg and sperm health. We'll be starting prenatals/vitamins, focusing extra on our diet, etc. - mostly things I am already doing now, but really ramping it up. One thing we really want to prioritize is reducing our alcohol consumption. I don't plan to go completely sober during the WTT/TTC phases (especially not knowing how long TTC will take!) but I want to drastically reduce my intake. Neither of us really drink on the weekdays, but our weekends are always jam-packed and always involving alcohol - going to breweries, sporting events/tailgates, meeting friends for drinks, etc.

Because we are so used to our weekend plans involving alcohol, we've been looking to expand our list of fun things to do that don't. I think this will be a good change for us so I've been eager and compiling a list of things we can do that don't center around bars/alcohol:

1. Joining the YMCA - we already have a gym membership, but we want to take up swimming. My husband also likes the opportunity for open gym basketball and other forms of exercise that are more fun.
2. Rock climbing
3. Training for a 5k/sprint triathlon 
4. Cooking/sushi making class
5. Bowling
6. Seeing a movie in the theater (extra points for picking one that serves dinner)
7. Working on our list of coffee shops and breakfast spots to try
8. Finding new bookstores
9. Planning day trips - there are a lot of small towns a short drive from us to explore, so checking out new shops and restaurants
10. Charcuterie board night
11. Pickleball
12. Couples massage
13. Hiking (once the weather improves, or finding cool winter hikes)
14. A-Z restaurant tour - you try new restaurants going from A to Z. Gets challenging for some letters!
15. Puzzle and mocktail night 

So my questions for you all- what is your plan for alcohol and WTT/TTC? What are your favorite weekend plans that DON'T involve alcohol? Looking for fun activities to add to the list. We'll also be cutting the alcohol on January 1 and live in Ohio, so bonus points for indoor ideas!

This might be a super common post but just in case there are new suggestions…

I’ll be in TO in a few weeks from Friday-Sunday (flying out after supper Sunday). 

I am going to a concert Friday night and a hockey game Saturday night.

I’ve already done the Riley’s aquarium, CN tower, Royal museum (which was awesome), the arcade place near CN tower. 

My hostel is near Kensington so I’ll be going there already. And I’m planning on taking a walk to Queen’s Park. 

I’m looking for a few chill places to hangout. I don’t really want to go from one end of the city/back and forth too much as I’m not super familiar with the transit system (I can manage getting to a few places but last time I was looking for the entrance to union station I felt like fool because I couldn’t see it 😂, and I’m going to Vegas Sunday so don’t really want to have a tired back/legs from constant site-seeing).

Some thoughts - I like coffee/tea, plan to bring a current crochet project so if there are cute places that i could do that and/or read without looking COMPLETELY out of place it would be a bonus. 

Also - if there are any good restaurants downtown that are great for solos! I’ll eat anything besides seafood/sushi. ",2,1727796868.0,askTO,0,1.0,False

So my (21f) husband (21m) and I live together and we both smoke. He likes glass pieces and a few months ago he bought a Rig that he’s been in love with for concentrate. Well since we’ve owned that Rig, he’s been leaving it on corners of tables with half of it hanging off the corner nonstop. He never puts it in the middle of the table or behind something it’s always the corners, he’s broke his “banger” (the small piece you place the heated dab for those who don’t know) many times and I’ve always let him get new ones, even if we were struggling with money. Well yesterday, he asked me to heat it for him and when I was finished, I was pushing stuff out of the way so I could put his torch down and some juice spilled. I panicked and stood up fast and that knocked the Rig to the ground and the banger broke. I poured water on it because it was catching fire and cleaned up the mess, but when he saw he got furious with me and was upset because “he got me food and everything tonight just to come home to that”. I was super upset with myself so I told him I was so sorry and that I’ll get him a new one. So the next morning we go out to get him a banger and we end up getting him an “ash catcher” (a big attachment) as well. No big deal I guess, I’m happy he’s happy again. When we got home I told him he needs to keep that rig in the center of the table or away from the corners especially now that it has an attachment that makes it twice its size. Well that same night i went to turn off the light and right next to our bed is a table that he put his rig on the corner of, and I got up and it fell on the floor and the attachment broke. He blew up and turned to the wall in our bed and I started crying because I again messed up. I cleaned it all up and apologized profusely and told him we will get another one for him and I was so sorry for breaking it. He went to bed and that was the first ever time in our 6 year relationship that he went to bed mad. This morning when we woke up he went to the bedroom while I got the kids ready and played a bunch of loud breakup music like we were in high school again. I let him be because I was getting the kids up and ready (two boys 3 and 1) and I went to check on him and he said nothing. Then after a while he comes out and says he’s mad that I didn’t go talk to him in the room. I was getting our kids up and changing diapers and getting them breakfast I’m sorry but was I supposed to wait to do all of that? So I tell him that I wasn’t able to leave them without taking care of them first, and that if he wanted to talk he could have came back out or helped me get them ready. I apologize again and start to tear up because again I broke his attachment and he says that it’s not about the attachment it’s about the fact that I can’t slow down, and that I’m always hurting myself around the house while he doesn’t. For context, we live in a trailer and there is almost no walkway space around anything except the living room, but even then our coffee table is quite large. As long as it’s pushed to the side, there’s plenty of space. So I tell him that I’m glad he can avoid it but I can’t, and I’ve came to terms with not being able to go a day without stubbing my toe until we get a real house. Well he said that he doesn’t hurt himself on things because he knows how to slow down. I feel like I’m running all over the place constantly so I understand that, but it’s because I have to tend to EVERYTHING around me. The kids always need mommy, the feedings, the juice spilling, my job, and my husband especially. I don’t complain about it though and yes I do hurt myself walking through the house but I also try my hardest not to and to watch what I’m doing always. But I’m not the only one who bumps into his rig, he does too and then gets mad. But when I do it he will express that anger and tell me to be more careful. So now I’m lost, and sad, and I feel like I’m an AH because I can’t slow down? Idk guys, AITA? ",0,1727796745.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,9,0.5,False

Now it’s more like 38:10. Like manic, had no interest in food on my fasting days. Some black coffee, green tea and mineral water and I am happy. And to break my fast on the next day, I begin by planning my food for the day. This wakes up my appetite. 

I now understand the difference between a 24 hour versus 48 hour digestion/metabolize schedule. Yes, we are always digesting and always metabolizing. But on the 48 hour schedule we are spending a lot more energy metabolizing than we do on the 24 hour schedule. 

So when family was coming over for lunch on Sunday I agreed to eat on my off day.  Was not hungry but ate anyway and then got somewhat hungry and ate around 60% of a normal meal day. 

The next day fasting was blah. No energy.  Not the clearest either. 

Christmas, Thanksgiving, NewYears!!! Okay I get it. Not a problem. But weekends? No. 

I like the 48 hours. I think my body needs all of that time to eat, digest and metabolize properly. 

During this experience, I have done everything I could possibly do to make my wife happy and to conceal my unhappiness with eating that Sunday meal. 

Today, she told me that she could see that interrupting my alternate days was not going well for me. From that one Sunday, I learned from ADF. Stay true and give things time. ",7,1727796664.0,AlternateDayFasting,1,1.0,False

I found the perfect SD- generous, respectful, caring, attentive. We get along so well and I actually enjoy spending time with him and he genuinely enjoys taking care of me! We’ve been together 2.5 months and it’s been great. 

I’ve also been in a situationship with a guy my age since January and we finally admitted our feelings to each other and are seriously considering being in a relationship. 

I told him that if we start a relationship, then I’ll end the sugar relationship because I don’t think it would be fair to him to have another person on the side. But I’m genuinely feeling really sad about having to let go of SD because I do like spending time with him and he’s been so supportive and encouraging while I’m going through really tricky work situations. I view him as a friend and mentor and it would be sad to let go. He’s also pretty old and is always saying how much joy I’ve brought into his life and how he hasn’t felt this happy and alive in years

The other crazy part of this is that he’s currently in Jordan and promised to get me some gold jewelry and Arab perfumes. He’s coming back in three weeks but I’m planning to talk to my situationship more this weekend. I want to give him room to communicate his boundaries but I do want to present the option of either meeting with my SD every so often platonically just for coffee and catching up (ideal situation) or do I need to completely cut him off. I’m going to leave it up to my situationship to decide what makes him most comfortable in a real relationship. 

Either way, when my SD gets back from his trip, do I tell him that I’m ending things right away? Do I accept the gifts? Do I wait for him to decide what to do with the gifts? Do I meet with him once after the trip and then tell him the second time I see him? How do I navigate this?? Please help!!!

Part of why I’m sharing this is because I hope that it can help others dealing with their own breakups. What’s surprised me the most is that I feel like I’ve gotten through the worst of it in just about a month. I had mentally prepared for the pain to last three months or even longer, so getting here sooner than expected is something I want to share in case it helps others going through the same thing.

# Relationship Timeline and Breakup

I was in a relationship with my ex-girlfriend from January to May. We took a break in June, and by July and August, we transitioned into an on-and-off Friends with Benefits (FwB) relationship. I agreed to the FwB arrangement only because I hoped it would give her time and space to process her emotions, and that we might eventually return to a serious, committed relationship.

However, by the end of August, I was emotionally drained from the uncertainty. I couldn’t focus at work, nor be mentally present in any other aspect of my life, as I was constantly thinking about the relationship. I realized that I couldn’t continue in such an undefined relationship without completely breaking down, and we decided to end things. Since the beginning of September, we’ve been in a No Contact phase.

# The Intensity of the Emotional Pain

The emotional pain during the breakup was so intense that it often felt like a physical ache. I constantly felt tightness in my chest from the sadness and anxiety. It was overwhelming, and I struggled to focus on anything else. Fortunately, this physical sensation has now faded, and I don’t feel as distressed anymore. However, it took time to get to this point, and the process was extremely painful.

# The Power of No Contact

The No Contact phase has been absolutely pivotal for me. While I’ve missed my ex tremendously, having this space has allowed me to truly process my emotions and begin healing. It’s been essential for my recovery and for coming to terms with the end of the relationship. Without this clear boundary, I don’t think I would have been able to move forward in the same way.

# Resources That Helped Me Heal

# Books

Two key books played a big role in my recovery. First, *Attached* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller helped me understand attachment styles and how my own fearful-avoidant attachment style affected the way I handled relationships and breakups. This book is practical, easy to read, and it gave me insights into why I reacted the way I did.

Second, I read *The Breakup Manual for Men* by Andrew Ferebee. This book provided a step-by-step guide for recovering from a serious breakup, and I followed many of its recommendations. One of the most powerful pieces of advice I took from the book was the question: ""Do I believe there are other women I could create a better connection with than my ex? If the answer is no, then you aren't ready."" This helped me recognize that I wasn’t viewing my ex or the relationship realistically.

# YouTube Videos

I also watched countless hours of YouTube videos, and I found channels like Coach Lee, Coach Ken, and Matthew Hussey particularly useful when dealing with the No Contact phase and breakup recovery in general.

# Therapy and ChatGPT

I’ve had a few therapy sessions, but I wouldn’t say they’ve provided significant new insights or tools beyond what I’ve gotten from talking to friends. The main benefit of therapy has been having an outside person to talk to about my emotions, so I don’t always have to lean on my friends. However, my therapist told me that I have good potential to develop secure attachment in future relationships, as I’m now aware of my attachment style and can empathize with both my own and my partner’s perspective.

Interestingly, I’ve also relied heavily on ChatGPT as a therapeutic resource. It’s been surprisingly more helpful than my in-person therapy in terms of processing emotions and providing practical guidance. I found it invaluable for reflection and getting clearer on my feelings.

# Letting Myself Feel the Emotions

One of the most important things I’ve done during this process is not suppressing my emotions. I cried every single day, often multiple times a day, from the end of August until last week. The sadness was constantly present, and it felt overwhelming. However, I allowed myself to cry whenever I needed to. I believe it’s crucial not to fight against the sadness and pain that come with a breakup. Letting those feelings out, even though it’s been incredibly painful, has been a key part of my healing.

# Staying Active with Friends and Hobbies

I’ve kept myself active in various ways, which has been crucial in staying grounded. I go to the gym several times a week, spend time with friends doing things like going for coffee, riding motorcycles, hiking, and attending concerts. These activities have been a great way to stay connected to others and ease some of the emotional strain. On my own, I also take walks by the sea or in the forest. These walks, while often filled with thoughts about the relationship, have helped me process my feelings more deeply. Being in nature has provided a sense of calm and relief, even though I continue to think about the breakup during these moments.

# Healing Comes in Waves

One thing I’ve realized throughout this process is that healing doesn’t happen all at once. Emotions come in waves, and the breakup requires me to reflect on the relationship from different perspectives over time. It takes time to address all aspects of the breakup, and that’s okay. I’ve learned to give myself time to understand and process everything.

# Where I Am Now

At the moment, I don’t feel like I miss my ex that much anymore. I think this is because I’ve come to terms with the disappointment that she didn’t love me or care for me enough to want to work on our relationship. Instead, she was willing to downgrade our friendship and love into a Friends with Benefits situation. No offense to anyone who engages in FwB relationships, but I personally don’t have much respect for those anymore. I’ve engaged in those kinds of relationships before, and my experience has led me to feel like there’s always a hint of exploitation—where one partner is good enough to satisfy sexual needs, but not for anything deeper. Moving forward, I want a relationship where we connect on an intellectual, emotional, and physical level. Sex is much better with someone you truly care about and with whom you want to build a lasting relationship.

Right now, I don’t feel ready to meet anyone new. I still feel like I would compare other women to my ex, and they would seem so much less interesting in comparison. I know this isn’t realistic and that these feelings are part of the grieving process I’m still going through. I’m sure this will change in time, and eventually, I’ll start to feel interested in other people, but that time isn’t now.

At the moment, my main emotion is disappointment—not just that the relationship didn’t succeed, but also that my ex-girlfriend didn’t love me as much as I loved her, enough to work on the relationship. That disappointment is what I’m living with most strongly at the moment, but I’m hopeful that in time, I’ll fully move on.

# Conclusion

The healing process hasn’t been easy, but looking back at the steps I’ve taken—No Contact, allowing myself to feel emotions, staying active, and using resources like books, YouTube, and ChatGPT—it has been key to getting to where I am now. I’ve learned to give myself time and recognize that healing comes in waves. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and hope that sharing this can help others going through a similar experience.",4,1727796345.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1ftqsir,https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarBABYonlyforum/comments/1ftqsir/how_do_i_end_things_with_my_sd/,How do I end things with my SD,"I found the perfect SD- generous, respectful, caring, attentive. We get along so well and I actually enjoy spending time with him and he genuinely enjoys taking care of me! We’ve been together 2.5 months and it’s been great. 

I’ve also been in a situationship with a guy my age since January and we finally admitted our feelings to each other and are seriously considering being in a relationship. 

I told him that if we start a relationship, then I’ll end the sugar relationship because I don’t think it would be fair to him to have another person on the side. But I’m genuinely feeling really sad about having to let go of SD because I do like spending time with him and he’s been so supportive and encouraging while I’m going through really tricky work situations. I view him as a friend and mentor and it would be sad to let go. He’s also pretty old and is always saying how much joy I’ve brought into his life and how he hasn’t felt this happy and alive in years

The other crazy part of this is that he’s currently in Jordan and promised to get me some gold jewelry and Arab perfumes. He’s coming back in three weeks but I’m planning to talk to my situationship more this weekend. I want to give him room to communicate his boundaries but I do want to present the option of either meeting with my SD every so often platonically just for coffee and catching up (ideal situation) or do I need to completely cut him off. I’m going to leave it up to my situationship to decide what makes him most comfortable in a real relationship. 

Either way, when my SD gets back from his trip, do I tell him that I’m ending things right away? Do I accept the gifts? Do I wait for him to decide what to do with the gifts? Do I meet with him once after the trip and then tell him the second time I see him? How do I navigate this?? Please help!!!

Edit:
Forgot to add that SD has told me he loves me twice and he clearly has a lot of feelings for me. Not sure how to let him down easy :(",1,1727796298.0,SugarBABYonlyforum,5,1.0,False

The riverfront trails were great to ride on and get to places. 

The bars downtown were very lively and I was surprised by how many options there were on the weekend. Also the number of coffee shops, restaurants and retail in the old downtown and hip strip area was huge and I like the old traditional downtown style, which unfortunately you couldn’t say about some of the new developments on the outskirts of town.

Everyone was extremely nice and wanted to let me know about the history of the town. Also really enjoyed the hiking and how close the mountains are.

My partner and I have been in a relationship for a year. In that time, I’ve visited him once and he’s come here four times. Each time he stays between two and three weeks. I know I am very lucky that we can see each other so often. 

The issue is that I’m in debt. My partner spends all his money on plane tickets and doesn’t have much when he’s here. So that I means I end up covering all the dates. We split groceries 50/50 but usually he’s buying more items and spending more of that money (he is addicted to soda and processed snacks whereas I try to balance frugality and health).

We went for a mini break for a couple days and was meant to split the hotel evenly. However when I brought up that I would like the money he owes me so I can pay my debt, he plays it off like he already paid me back via train tickets or a single coffee. I make more money (I have an office job, he’s self employed mainly living off government assistance) and I know that that means I can contribute more but I can be paying for both of us so often. 

I don’t know how to bring up that it’s such a big issue for me without it turning into a full-blown argument. We seem to fight a lot lately over his attitude and inability to clean up after himself in a timely manner. I know part of my issues is my autism and we both have adhd, but things are feeling out of hand. 

How can I explain to him that I would rather we see each other less so we have more money for fun things together?",2,1727796095.0,LongDistance,1,1.0,False

Was it the seed oils?,"Hello, I’m kinda new to this and just started reading into seed oils and all. So for the longest time I was trying to pinpoint what I was eating / drinking everyday to cause my breakouts . Never even thought about my coffee choices maybe affecting my skin until now . So I have been drinking oat milk, dairy free creamers like silk, oatly , planet oat etc. I used to drink coffee at starbucks with 1-2 pumps of mocha in it as well ( my skin was fine during that time unless i got sugar free vanilla or any really sweet flavor ) I was doing a food/ skin diary during that time . 

Anyways i stopped going to Starbucks a long time ago and started making coffee at home with the non dairy creamers . I was having consistent breakouts on my neck and jawline for months almost like cystic deep bumps all over my neck . Then I went on vacation out of the country and couldn’t find any non dairy options and didnt want to be difficult lol . So I drank coffee with regular cream and half a sugar packet each day . I came back and the cystic bumps were fading . I noticed this and decided to try regular cream longer . I also looked at the creamers I was using and they all have seed oils or processed ingredients compared to the 4 ingredient natural milk creamer . Bumps on my neck are basically non existent now. No new breakouts. 

sorry for such a long rant and if this sounds stupid, but would it be the seed oils or the oat milk itself that was causing this ? Is there tests that can see if allergic to seed oils ? I also heard seed oils can affect hormones ? ",3,1727795878.0,StopEatingSeedOils,3,1.0,False

It started of super quiet and only on one ear
No idea what started it 

I had my first concert a couple of months prior but idk if that's the reason.

It's been consistent for the first 6 months and since then it gets worse every 2 months I think...
I avoid loud noises, I wear ear protection whenever it gets louder or at a concert (which I haven't before but whenever it gets worse now it's for no reason)

And I cut off alcohol, I still drink coffee but I tried cutting it and noticed no difference, so I'm still drinking my beloved coffee lol.


Tried cutting dairy and just eating healthy overall but it didn't help either.


Now i don't know why it gets worse constantly, I have a spike for around two weeks now and it's so incredibly bad like never before...
Idk what to do I feel so incredibly helpless and frustrated.

Why does it get worse constantly??

If this spike doesn't go away again idk what to do, I've already had trouble sleeping, I do got around 10 years no but no doctor found the root.

And since I got my tinnitus it got obviously worse it got REALLY bad at every spike ( rarely it did got better again tho) where I woke up several times a night with panic attacks.

And this is the case again rn.. it got worse two weeks ago and I think even worse one week ago, because for like a week I'm having these panic attacks again and i feel like if this spike doesn't settle the only solution would be death.


No doctor will prescribe me smth to sleep, I only take Baldrian pills cus I don't have anything else.

I just wanna be able to sleep again without hearing this...

I listen to audiobooks but I'm someone who need full silence to sleep.. so this troubles me a little aswell, but it's still better than nothing.

Pls can anyone tell me why it just constantly seems to get worse?? I'm only in my late twenties, and at this rate I don't see myself hitting 30.

I wasn't sure if I should hit venting or adobe support cus I'm the end it's both. I just don't know what to do anymore :(",5,1727795711.0,tinnitus,0,1.0,False

This is my first time looking for a designer or affordable designer bag, and I’m hoping to find something I can use on a daily basis, whether for work or casual outings like grabbing a coffee. I prefer items that are durable and long-lasting, as I like to use things until their lifespan is over.

I’ve been looking at the Longchamp Le Pliage and the Baggu tote bag, but I’d love to hear your thoughts and any recommendations you may have.

1. Since the population of the whole country is 380,000, it was nice to be at a Costco that's not crowded.
2. If you're road tripping in Iceland, this is the place to get snacks and gas since its the cheapest option.
3. For the most part the layout is the same as any other Costco.
4. Saw some neat stuff I've never seen back in the States. Starlink satellites, Boxes of Dunkin Donuts dozens, Lego sets, lamb in bulk and KIRKLAND SUSHI!.
5. There was an attendant scanning everyone's ID. Funny enough, he didn't scan mine. I used my Costco Visa Card to get in. Not sure why I was the exception.
6. They do have an alcohol section but it is walled off. Only people with a valid restaurant license can buy alcohol at Costco.
7. Food court is the biggest difference. When I was there, the menu was: coffee, froyo, Kirkland gelato, hot dog, Mexican Bake (No chicken bake), Pizza (Also had BBQ chicken pizza as an option). Cheapest place to get lunch in Iceland too FYI.

Yesterday, work seemed back to normal… I didn’t cry! 

Overall rating 7.5/10

Oreo milkshake (not pictured, tried before) 4/10 - I personally just hate this one, it’s not Oreo to me. The only thing I like is the base because of the big Oreo chunks, but overall it just tastes like sugar with the frosting. 

Oatmeal chocolate chip 🥣 7/10 - simple cookie but that doesn’t make it bad! In fact, it’s very homey, if that makes sense. Like a fall morning at home, a cup of coffee and a bowl of oats… with chocolate! It has a nice blend of spices, good texture with the oats and I actually like the milk chocolate chunks even though I bet semi sweet would be better. 

Ultimate peanut butter 🥜 8/10 - simple cookie, but I loooove peanut butter so this is getting a higher rating. I slathered a layer of peanut butter on mine (and most of the customer’s cookies hehe) because I can’t have enough peanut butter. It does fall apart easily though which is annoying

Pumpkin cake 🎃 7.9/10 - ohhhh I love these cakey pumpkin cookies soooo much!!!! It’s not as good as the caramel pumpkin cake, but I love the crunch of mini chocolate chips. I don’t have much to say about this one! 

Brownie sundae LTO 🍒 9/10 - I know, I know. I don’t support the LTO items because I want COOKIES but I hated the brownie sundae cookie… this is wayyyyy better. Surprisingly, the brownie isn’t a box mix! And there’s so many chocolate chips inside that it’s… honestly more of just a chocolate chip mass with some brownie in between. The mousse is pretty plain, it would be better with the vanilla bean mousse from the skillet cookie! But overall, it’s super rich in chocolate and I love that.

Sitting beside me, my husband gently places a hand on my thigh, his gaze soft as it meets mine. ""Are you warm enough?"" he asks, his voice tender, laced with quiet concern. I smile, reassured by the thoughtfulness that always seems to accompany his every word and action.

""I'm quite warm,"" I reply, the corners of my lips curling as I lean in to press a kiss to his cheek. His hand moves gently, brushing a loose strand of hair from my face, and in that simple gesture, I feel utterly cherished.

""Good,"" he says, his eyes lingering on mine for just a moment longer, before he turns back to the peaceful morning.

""Will we have time to ride today?"" I ask, the thought of our shared love for the outdoors stirs much excitement within me.

We had a toxic relationship and it ended with me being unfaithful. I feel awful about it and will forever hold that guilt in my heart. We used to live in my small apartment and had planned to move to a nicer place right before it ended. After we broke up, he moved to the new apartment while I stayed in mine, we still talked here and there but he never wanted to get back together with me. A year after we broke up I met this amazing guy (28M) that was very different from anyone I had ever met in my life. He was a true gentle man, always opened the car door for me, made sure I was safe in any situation, brought me coffee unexpectedly and during my period bought me a heating pad and made sure I was always ok. We had instant chemistry and he was giving all green flags. There was a couple of small problems however, he had gotten cheated on by his ex of 6 years and I was also still in contact with my ex. We tried to still make it work even with his hesitancy, but I needed to stop talking to my ex. Before we were official I had already plans to go on a skii trip with a group of people and my ex. I had told the new guy about it and he wasn't happy with it but we were not official and could not tell me to not go. When I went on the skii trip it got complicated because now my ex wanted to get back together and told me I was only there because this was his attempt at us rekindling things. I told my ex I was seeing someone new and that I wanted to see it through but things just kept getting complicated. I was sleeping in the same room as my ex and did not tell the new guy. Nothing happened but when my ex threatened to tell the new guy that we were sleeping in the same bed, I decided to tell him instead. We were able to get through this but trust was definitely becoming an issue. Eventually he asked me to be his girlfriend and I agreed. 

A couple of months later, my now boyfriend and I went on a trip. We had some issues before the trip that had us both on edge. I confided in one of my guy friends who had asked me how the trip was going and I was brutally honest about it and didnt say very nice things. Apparently, I got really drunk during the trip and said some things that prompted my boyfriend to look through my phone while I was asleep and he found the conversation. He did not say anything during the trip, just was really mean and distant. It wasn't until a week later after we got back that he woke me up in the middle of the night and confronted me about it. Saying It was emotional cheating. We still decided to move forward and work on our trust after this.

A couple months later, I had been talking to my ex, nothing sexual just checking how he was. Obviously after 7 years it is hard to let go of someone that was you whole world and I clearly had this issue of not letting go. My boyfriend sensed that something was off and this prompted him to look through my phone again and find deleted messages of conversations I had with my ex. I had no idea they were even still on my phone and I was furious but I was clearly at fault. By now he has no trust in me and things Im an emotional cheater through and through. 

I have been going through therapy and trying to work on gaining his trust back, but obviously it is a lot harder than I thought it would be. I quit drinking, Ive been going to the gym regularly, I have a second job and am in the process of moving so cheating is the last thing on my mind. My ex has been blocked on everything and I haven't had any contact with him.

Now to the actual question I have. My friend invited me to her wedding. Ive known the groom since I was 16 years old and I met his fiancé when they first started dating. Her and I clicked immediately and have been friends for over 5 years. Their wedding had been in the works for 2 years now. Unfortunately, my ex is also friends with the groom and will be attending the wedding. My now boyfriend does not want me to attend because he does not feel comfortable with me drinking at a wedding with my ex there. I really want to go because I care about my friends and this is the first wedding Ive ever been invited to just me. I know I wouldn't do anything with my ex and would avoid conversations at all cost. 

I want to get some external advise on whether I should go or not and if I should, how I can approach the situation to reassure him nothing would happen between us and that this event is important to me. 

BTW we have only been dating for 7 months now.

I am pretty new to working with sales professionals so I want to make sure that I'm offering fair compensation.

We sell a tea product that's used regularly by specialty coffee shops, and we consider selling one initial unit to a new coffee shop to be a new ""account"".

My question is, if I'm offering commission, should I compensate on a per-unit basis, on a per-account basis, or some combination of both? To give some context, our unit prices for wholesale range from about $50-$150, and our wholesale margins are currently around 30%.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Celso, Job-deficient Yotul***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 22nd, 2136*

Waking up was typically far less exciting. Also, I didn’t expect to be jumping out of a window today.

I opened my eyes to the sound of someone knocking on my door. I rolled myself upright and yawned, stretching my aching legs.

The knocking didn’t come again, and for a moment I thought that would be that. Instead, a familiar loud creaking emanated from the door.

I rushed over to answer it for it to instead burst open, revealing a familiar old, shaggy Venlil in all his grumpy glory. The ends of his dark gray ears were several shades lighter than the rest of him. I did not envy his age. “Gah, old door!” he grumbled, apparently not noticing me.

“Sorry,” I started. “I wasn’t expecting visitors.”

“Wah!” My landlord focused one of his crusty eyes on me. Probably his good one. “You! You’re supposed to be gone!”

I nervously laughed. “Yeah, funny story, I wanted to check when I was supposed to be out, but my holopad had a very unfortunate accident and the screen cracked, so—”

“That’s not my problem! You get out! Out!”

“I’m not trying to be a squatter! Just give me a few minutes to gather my things and I’ll be out of your fur.”

“Oh no! I’m not letting this start! I gave you a more-than-lawful twelve paws notice, and you’re still here!”

“I’ve had a rough herd of paws. Can you give me a *little* slack? A quarter claw is all I need.”

“The last person I gave a quarter claw to ended up living in my walls for… I don’t even know how long! I’m not getting burned again!”

“I only need—” My voice faltered as I realized what he said. I couldn’t help but twist my ears in confusion. “Was it a Dossur?”

He squinted angrily. “That’s besides the point!”

“What do you mean? I have no intention of living in your walls!”

“That’s besides the point, too! This is my first and last time ever taking a Yotul into these apartments! You primitives have no respect for modern housing practice!”

“You call this place modern housing?” I shouldn’t have said that, but I couldn’t stop myself.

He glared at me. “I’m calling the exterminators.”

“Okay, okay! An *eighth* of a claw! That’s all I need!”

“Eight is bigger than four!” he said after a painfully wrong mental calculation. Before I could correct him, he pulled out his holopad and after a mere two taps it started ringing. “They’re on the line now.”

I stared wide-eyed. “Do you have them on speed dial?”

“Of course I do! You think you’re the first person to try and skirt an eviction around this place?”

“Given your attitude, that doesn’t surprise me. And I’m not trying to skirt around it!”

His glare persisted a while longer before it suddenly vanished. His whole expression lit up and he spoke into the holopad, “Yes, hello, I have— Yes, it’s me again— Yes, I— No, it’s not about the Dossur!”

Realizing I had mere minutes before I was escorted out, or worse, *detained*, I whirled around.

I rushed into my sleeping room to grab my satchel. It was proudly made on Leirn out of fine textile, designed to carry a scholar’s many books for a lifetime, and had been prematurely passed down a generation. Now, it bore the high honor of carrying whatever I could cram into it.

I grabbed a few loose pieces of paper which had some of my notes about possible jobs and places to live (all of which were even worse than *this* place, somehow) scribbled on them, along with my favorite pens (I only had two pens, but they were definitely my favorites). I grabbed a few loose things which were better off kept, and almost made my way out of the room without grabbing one of my most prized possessions.

It was sitting isolated in the corner wrapped in its protective film. With measured movements, I carefully folded up the decades old paper and slid it gently into my satchel. To think I’d almost left without it.

With it safely and securely tucked away, I thought about what would be most useful to have if I had to take a nap on a park bench or under a bridge. A pillow didn’t easily fit into my satchel. The next best option was food.

I grabbed my fruit with old eyes still glaring at me before I eventually got to my holopad. I accidentally nudged a button in my hurry, and the larger monitor came to life. A small notification caught my eye. It was an email.

I had no faith it was good news but something compelled me to check it regardless. I scrambled for the external keyboard and smacked a few keys. It was from Doctor Scheele.

>Hello Celso,

>I enjoyed our conversation yesterday, however brief it was. I believe you’re well qualified for the position, and I’d like to have another talk with you about possible projects that you might be able to undertake. It would help me determine if you’d be a good fit here.

>If you wish to proceed, I’d like to meet at your earliest convenience. My working hours are between…

My reading was interrupted by the gravelly voice of my landlord. “Finally you’re here! He’s just inside.”

I ripped the cord out of my holopad and stuffed it inside my satchel along with my external keyboard. As much as I wanted to take my prized dumpster monitor, I had to leave it along with the rest of my belongings. A quick glance at the door told me I was out of time.

The blue feathers and pointy yellow beak of a Krakotl had emerged, ruffled and ready for a round of forcing a Yotul into compliance.

“Are you the former tenant?” she asked, the scraggly old Venlil hiding behind her.

“Not even going to give me a ‘hello’?” I responded, buckling my satchel.

“Hello. Please come with us peacefully,” she demanded.

I picked my fruit up off the floor. “Uh, look, I’d love to, but I’ve got a… thing… later. No hard feelings?”

“I… What?”

My eyes darted left and right, and landed on my zifla. My poor withered zifla, right next to the single window. “Say, I don’t suppose there’s any chance you’ll just let me go freely?”

The Krakotl crept further inside. “You’ll just have to answer a few questions. Based on that, we may have to screen you for predator disease.”

I winced. “What does that have to do with anything?”

“It’s an unfortunate trend that those who try to dodge an eviction tend to have underlying issues for why they’re evicted in the first place.”

Behind her, I spotted a decidedly chunky Gojid, which doubly affirmed my judgment that I wasn’t making it out through the door. Again my eyes landed on the window. For once, I was thankful that I couldn't afford a proper apartment with a balcony. My half-buried abode would finally serve me well.

I was sad to leave my monitor and everything else that I’d paid so much for, but I wasn’t risking a predator disease screening. With a burst of speed I yanked its stool out from underneath causing it to clatter to the floor, and I slid the stool against the wall. I jumped onto it and reached high for the window.

The thing was almost as stubborn as my door (and my former landlord, for that matter). Behind me, the bird squawked, “Stop what you’re doing!”

“Look, you seem like a nice lady, but I’m not really looking for something serious right now!” Finally the window gave, and I threw my satchel through it, then my fruit.

“Don’t you dare!” the Gojid rumbled.

I used all my might to leap upwards and grab onto the edges of the window, trying to pull myself through the deceptively slim opening. “You also seem nice, but a group of three isn’t really something I see myself—”

I yelped as something grabbed onto my leg. I tugged with some success, but it was soon accompanied by a second, more feathery something. My poor zifla got knocked off the sill and fell to the floor with the sound of shattered ceramic. I had one option left. I flexed my muscles.

An ear-cracking *SQUAWK* pierced the air and I was freed.

“I’m so sorry!” I called out as I shimmied the rest of myself through the window. “I *really* didn’t mean to do that! I have this leg condition, and it— Well, it doesn’t really matter, but I’m sorry, and I hope you two can find the right person to complete your triangle!”

A tiny, guilty part of me was not sorry in the slightest. I heard the Gojid shouting from the window, but I was already off. I was saddened to leave my zifla behind. It was yet another irreplaceable item in my life that had been taken from me too suddenly. They would understand. Yuili would understand. I’d just have to find the courage to tell her…

*At your earliest convenience*, the email said. I bit into my fruit and dashed in the direction I’d come home last paw.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Doctor Andrew Scheele, Senior Researcher at the UN-VR Cooperative Institute of Integrative Xenobiology***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 22nd, 2136*

I arrived at work a little later than I usually did. I usually had Bemlin to keep me on time, but he left early so we couldn’t walk together. One thing that wasn’t unusual was the endless emails I had to respond to or archive.

I tinkered with the Gojid genome assembly for a while. The UN had made some file conversion software publicly available, but I couldn’t figure it out for the life of me, and was beginning to doubt if it even worked. How hard could it be to convert a few billion letters from one file format to another? I didn’t even need the annotations.

To make matters worse, the dumb KeiVei-Lay software was incredibly stubborn. The name of the Kolshian brand was apparently a play on words that, very loosely, translated to something like “EZ-Gene”. Though apparently less cute sounding and more stern in the native language.

By both the translation and the fact that it was hundreds of years old, a sane person could’ve reasoned all that time would’ve allowed for easy-to-use and intuitive features. The Federation was not sane, unfortunately.

I took a break (gave up) trying to get the exact sequence into a “normal” file on my own computer, which put me at about an hour or two of work. An hour or two of work before I succumbed to temptation.

Currently, my screen showed me an enticing image. Stainless steel. Minimalist design. Top-notch instrumentation and diagnostics. It could get me results in a matter of minutes.

I was no stranger to extracting chemicals, but this device made things so much simpler. Through a controlled process of temperature, pressure, and filtration, I could achieve solvation of various aromatic compounds. The mechanisms and sensors within ensured said compounds would be extracted swiftly and without burning them.

The filters it used were dirt-cheap, though I imagined shipping from Earth would tack on an extra few bucks. I could find sucrose or some artificial alternatives on this planet easy enough. Lactose, however, might be a bit trickier; I’d have to pay shipping for that, too.

But it would be more than worth it. I’d gone far too long without one on this morningless planet. I did some quick math in my head and concluded that this was the correct choice going forward. An early Christmas gift to myself.

*Would Bemlin like coffee? I wonder what alien caffeine tolerance is like. I’m pretty sure adenosine receptors are ubiquitous, though I should double check some toxicology databases. In that case, I wonder if theobromine is toxic…*

I made a mental note to order some chocolate later and placed the order. Four-to-five business days was pretty quick, considering everything.

A rap on my office door shook me from my early-morning delirium. Bemlin invited himself in, and I sensed a habit forming.

“Hey. What’s up?” I greeted.

“I am doing well. Would you like to see something?”

“Intriguing. Before I get up, would *you* like to see something?” I gestured to my screen.

He squinted, possibly annoyed at my switcheroo. “I may as well… What is that?”

“A coffee machine. Though not a business expense, unfortunately.”

“What is its purpose?”

“It makes coffee.”

“That is unhelpful.”

I sighed. “It takes mental stimulants out of a plant and puts it into a beverage for me to enjoy.”

“Ah, I see. I didn’t… Well, I’m not sure what I expected of human drug intake methods.”

“I wouldn’t call it—” I started, before realizing that he was exactly right. “Okay, it *is* a drug. But a fun drug. Er, not a *fun* drug, more of a normal drug. Er, that’s not a very good word either. Uh… I dunno. It makes me marginally more alert.”

The Gojid blinked.

“You wanna try some?” I asked. “You seem like a black coffee kind of guy, Bemlin.”

“I assume that is a compliment. I would be willing to sample it.”

“Great. Five business days, whenever that is. Anyways, what’s up?”

Bemlin gave me a pointed look. “I wanted to show you something.”

I stood. “Right.”

I was glad to be out of my office. I grabbed my holopad and followed him into the work room. He pointed at something on the screen.

“I found this.” He was pointing at a useless jumble of alien symbols by what I assumed was a noteworthy DNA sequence.

“Okay. Is… Is that the actual letter sequence on KeiVei-Lay? How did you get that?”

“Not quite the same software, but it was surprisingly stubborn. It would not give me access directly, I had to import the file and open it as two separate file types before putting it into a text document. From there I have made manual annotations.”

“I know that pain, I’m dealing with— Wait, you opened up the *entire genome* on a text document?”

“Yes.”

I couldn’t help but laugh. “More power to you, I suppose. I didn’t take you for a computer savvy guy. Is it… workable?”

“Workable enough. Have a look.”

I looked at his other monitor, where he highlighted an empty region on the genome assembly. “Is it worth translating the text?”

“No, it’s just some notes. This region on the genome is, with some room for doubt, a gene. But it doesn’t exist in any assemblies I’ve looked at.”

“How did you find it, then?”

His eyes lit up, something I rarely saw from him. “I’m glad you asked! I searched for the consensus promoter sequence, and picked the first one that was not marked in the assembly. Then I checked that it was followed by a start codon and a stop codon later,” he proudly summarized.

I wasn’t sure if I should’ve been impressed or not. His process seemed fairly standard to me, but he acted like this was a novel feat. What did the Federation typically include in their curriculum for this sort of stuff? Regardless, I found it easy to match Bemlin’s burst of energy. “That’s great! How do you know it’s an actual gene?”

“The start and stop codons are separated by the average length of a gene, give or take a few thousand base pairs.”

I nodded. “Any plans to sort out the introns?”

“That’s what I’m trying to work out next.”

“How long did this take you?”

He checked the time. “About… uh, half a claw? I believe that’s correct. And some initial digging around in the text document last paw.”

*Two hours?* “For this one gene?”

“Yes!” he proudly stated. “Although I admit that most of that time was trying to find a promoter that wasn’t already marked. I’d begun to worry that I was doing this for nothing.”

I winced, knowing how painful it must have been to *manually* search through thousands of genes. I could’ve asked an AI to do the same thing for most, if not all hidden genes, and return it in a neatly ordered list in half that time. Though I wasn’t sure how it would like the Gojid genetic code. If I could even manage to convert the files.

“Alright. This is great work and I love it, but I think I could do this much quicker with one of my methods. Er, eventually.”

He tapped his claws in a frown. “Does it involve this coveted human AI that I’ve heard so much about?”

“Yep. I’m telling you, Bemlin, come to the dark side.”

He took on a puzzled expression. “Of… Venlil Prime?”

I shook my head, smiling. “Not quite.”

Just then, my holopad buzzed with a call. It was from reception. I answered on speaker, “Hey.”

*“Good paw, Doctor Scheele. I have a, uhm, Yotul here who wants to see you.”*

Bemlin looked just as surprised as I was. I replied, “Is it Celso?”

A brief pause. *“Yes. Would you like me to send him away?”*

“What? No! Send him to my office. Why’s he here?”

*“He says—”*

“Doesn’t matter. Just send him up.” I ended the call.

“You’re moving forward with him?” Bemlin asked.

I recalled the email I sent to the Yotul. A few minutes of talking didn’t exactly constitute a job position, and I wanted to better feel for him. I wasn’t expecting it so soon, however. “Don’t know. Probably.”

“But you weren’t expecting him here?”

I checked my email, confirming I’d heard nothing from Celso. “No… I’m sure there’s a good reason.” I got up from my seat.

As I made my way out, Bemlin said, “I think it’s good you’re taking him in. He could learn a lot from you.”

I frowned, wondering what he meant by that. “Thanks, Bemlin. Oh, and if you do get the introns sorted out, let me know! I’ve got a trick that’s gonna blow your mind.”

Just, like, an endless ticker tape of complaints from people who keep giving their money to what they're complaining about, probably on a daily or near-daily basis. Complaints directed at strangers on reddit instead of, you know, the management at the restaurant who have the ability to address the issue at hand. Comment sections regurgitating the same things again and again and again.

The tendency to just complain endlessly about something you don't like instead of focusing energy on something better is a reddit-wide issue, I know, but Jesus Christ people, why don't you put your money where your mouth is and support some local cafe or bakery instead? Or, if you have literally no other option (which I have trouble believing), communicate with the store manager so they can make an attempt to address your issues!

I'm trying to make sense of my test-results and according to what i'm reading on here and elsewhere the many heterozygous SNPs point to problems with methylation?

My sister is a neurologist and she knows a lot about genetics in general but i have the impression that she overestimates her knowledge in this exact area. I asked her to  take a look at my methylation-panel but in her opinion everything is perfectly fine.

About me:  
I'm struggling with life long mental problems (ADHD, Stress, Depression, Anxiety) and have been trying to tackle potential route-causes lately. Obviously there are many factors in mental-health (i recently found out about dysbiosis of my microbiome and am working on that as my current main priority) but certain experiences with supplements lead me to think that something with methylation is causing problems and should be adressed:

* B-Vitamin-Complex supplements reliably caused anxiety/stress/depression for me.
* A juice with added folate and B12 (i don't know in what form) recently did the same.
* 5-MTHF was terrible as well as Choline and TMG
* Coffee and stimulants make me super anxious

Does this point to me being an overmethylator?

My current approach is to follow the guidelines pointed out here:

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese course on Duolingo.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1ftpz8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1ftpz8w/repetitive_businesses_in_our_neighborhood/,Repetitive businesses in our neighborhood ,"A friend and I were talking about how our neighborhood seems to have the same types of businesses opening over and over—another bubble tea shop, another dentist office. We joked that all the sugar must be keeping the dentists in business! This led us to make a list of the most common businesses popping up in the area.

We started wondering why, in such a densely populated neighborhood, unique businesses don’t seem to thrive. We suspect landlords might prefer these safer options, but it doesn’t quite add up, especially with competition and high rent costs.

To investigate, we took a walk from Addison to Fullerton along Broadway (about 1.5 miles) and roughly counted businesses. Here’s what we found:

- 7 bubble tea shops
- 9 coffee spots
- 9 dentist offices
- 8 pastry shops
- 3 ice cream parlors
- 4 med spas
- 13 fitness-related businesses
- 5 sports medicine/chiropractors
- 20 nail salons
- 15 hair salons
- 10 vape shops
- 7 convenience stores
- 6 eye doctors
- 6 smoothie/juice places

It’s just an observation, and obviously the numbers would change including a larger radius but we’re curious if others have noticed similar patterns in their own neighborhoods.",46,1727794252.0,chicago,68,0.85,False

B. Do the flavors make sense? I’m wondering if I should just do chocolate, coffee, and vanilla? Out of fear the cakes going to be too sweet and I should do something a little more plain? 

Additionally I’ve never worked with pastry cream before so I’m wondering if I should freeze it into thin inserts so it can go between the layers and assemble easier as opposed to putting a layer on it, waiting, frosting, then putting on another layer.

I get Zeus is hard to convince being once he makes a decision as king of the gods that decision is pretty much  final. But.. Im missing exactly why Ody was being ""punished"" by Zeus with being trapped by Calypso. I thought his punishment was actually the choice of his life or the crew. Not to mention Ody tried to save the cows and at since this was after mutiny, technically he was no longer the ""captain"".

I met this amazing girl on my travels and we clicked almost instantly. She has everything a lot that I'm looking for: She's beautiful, smart, really, really sweet and she wants kids. Though I'm not necessarily looking for my ""forever"" person right now, she comes pretty damn close to what I'm looking for on paper.

We met the first time on a Sunday night and had a great time, the next day we met was a Monday evening where we spent time getting dinner and chatting. I can tell she's been through a lot, has a lot of pain and damage, but I remember feeling like she was someone I could really trust when I told her I was feeling cold and she rubbed my legs to make sure I was warm. It was really, really cute. I did notice that her ex came up in conversations a little bit more than I've experienced on other dates, which made me feel a little uneasy. We ended up spending that night together (no sex), cuddling and holding hands. She's not the biggest kisser (which tbh, is something that does stick out for me because I really love kissing), but there was a lot of loving, caring touch. We were having a hard time falling asleep and her ex called her at 4am, apparently she had told her ex about how good our date was after our date the previous night, which left me wondering and a little skeptical as to why her ex would need to know this information at all. And the fact that this woman was calling at 4am and she was affected by it also made me feel like she needs to just cut this woman out of her life forever.

Two days later, we were supposed to meet for coffee but her ex showed up unannounced at her house before we were scheduled to meet. Pretty manipulative of her ex, tbh, but I also was just really confused and hurt by this. Of course, I felt bad for her, but it was confusing to me as the outside person to really grasp what was going on in their dynamic. I feel like maybe they weren't as ""over"" as I thought, although she explicitly has told me they are but idk something about their dynamic just isn't sitting right with me. It could also be a classic abusive relationship?

There are things about her that I don't love too much: She's pretty emotionally avoidant, smokes a ton of cigarettes, isn't out to her parents (they've actively been trying to get her to marry a man), detaches quite often emotionally when conversation becomes to ""intense"" (which I think her threshold for is a little low because of the built up trauma, etc). And idk I'm just so torn. We've only known each other three weeks, but I really feel a strong connection to her in a lot of ways. I just really, really can't cope with another heartbreak like this. I asked her to talk about things over the phone regarding where we are (we'd also be doing long-distance from Asia to the USA), and she was like ""Is this going to be a heavy conversation?"" which is making me think I'm way TOO invested 3 weeks in and she's like... ""What does this girl even wanna talk about?""

Anyways, I'm not sure what to do. I do want to have a conversation with her about all of my feelings about why I'm skeptical to continue flirting and that maybe it's best we just be ""friends."" But do you think I'm giving up too soon?",0,1727793782.0,actuallesbians,1,0.5,False
