1obeec7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SadhguruTruth/comments/1obeec7/why_we_walked_into_isha_and_went_blind_when_truth/,Why We Walked Into Isha — and Went Blind When Truth Stared Us in the Face (Part 2),"I used to stay in Manhattan.  
Used to leave work early and catch the metro.  
The city would spill out of its offices around 5:30 p.m. —  
like a river bursting its banks.

I’d usually finish thirty minutes earlier —  
just to avoid that flood of bodies.  
Same routine every day.  
Down few hundred narrow steps,  
winding into that damp underbelly of the city.  
Dim bulbs, iron railings,  
and the echo of footsteps like some kind of heartbeat.

One day — same stairs, same rush —  
but when I reached the bottom,  
the gate was shut.  
A rusted sign hung across the barrier:  
**“Use the other exit.”**

I thought, maybe I could jump it.  
Tried once — couldn’t.  
Briefcase slipped.  
Almost fell.  
So I turned around to climb back up.

But it was already too late.  
5:20 p.m.  
The whole city was now pouring down those stairs —  
men, women, briefcases, coffee cups, phones —  
each one locked in their own little worlds.  
A deluge of humanity.  
It was Times Square station.  
A madhouse.

I waved.  
I yelled.  
“Not this way! It’s closed!”  
No one looked.  
No one heard.  
They brushed past — eyes empty —  
each one desperate to reach somewhere  
they thought existed.

*And standing there,*  
*pinned against that iron railing,*  
*I understood something.*

**I knew the truth.**  
**But I couldn’t make anyone else see it.**  
Because they hadn’t walked those same stairs yet.  
They hadn’t reached that locked gate themselves.  
They hadn’t tried and failed to jump it.

Each one would have to go all the way down —  
only to discover for themselves  
that the exit was closed.  
And only then would they turn back.

That’s how truth works.  
It has an instinctive dislike for the masses.  
That’s why it never resides among them.  
It’s not collective.  
It’s solitary.  
You don’t arrive there through belief —  
you stumble into it through experience.

It cares two hoots about mass appeal or applause.  
It doesn’t campaign for followers.  
It doesn’t need anyone to agree with it.

It just is.  
Absolute. Quiet.  
Unconcerned with how many people walk past it.

And when you do see it —  
really see it —  
it’s both unbearable and freeing.  
Because you realize  
you’ve been running with the crowd all along,  
but in the wrong direction.

**That’s the strange gift of truth —**  
*it isolates you first,*  
*then liberates you.*  
*It doesn’t offer comfort or solace.*  
*It burns the exact illusions that once kept you safe —*  
*yes, those very illusions you chose to believe in.*

*So when people ask,*  
*“Why didn’t you warn others?”*  
*or*  
*“Why don’t they see it yet?” —*  
*this is why.*

They have to walk those stairs themselves.  
They have to find that sign —  
**“Use the other exit.”**  
And only then will they climb back up,  
breathless, shaken,  
and laughing — maybe crying —  
knowing exactly what the truth feels like.

*Truth doesn’t need validation.*  
*It doesn’t bend to numbers.*  
*It’s the one thing left standing*  
*when the crowd thins out and the noise fades.*

**And you ignore it only at your own peril.**

*I couldn’t find a better day to share this*  
*than on Deepawali.*  
*A day when everything that Shri Ram stood for —*  
*Dharma, clarity, truth —*  
*has been almost forgotten.*

May this Deepawali light up that part of you  
that still remembers.  
Not the crowd.  
Not the chanting.  
Just that quiet voice inside  
that says — **“Not this way.”**

What you just read —  
this was my answer to both questions:

Even if someone spoke the truth to you,  
laid it out plain — black and white —  
would you believe it?

And to the other one that still haunts many of us —  
why do those who know the truth, stay silent?

*(P.S. — Ram Dass told the original version of this story.*  
*I just lived mine — one evening on the Delhi metro stairs.*  
*Rajiv Chowk, maybe Saket — doesn’t matter.*  
*The truth felt the same.)*

So: Folks in Kandy, preferably 25+: if you're around, let me know if you'd be interested in a monthly meet-up at a not-to-expensive place (I'm thinking Tavern29 or the Riverlution at Oak Ray). I can bring an Uno deck and/or Risk. We ideally don't want to meet too often, but once a month is a generally enough. 

We'll get along if you like literature (especially science fiction and fantasy), video games, history, interesting code, and/or you have some obscure hobby where you make or collect things. 

We absolutely won't get along if your idea of reading is mostly limited to the self-help section or if you're Andrew Tate-pilled, so pre-emptive filter in place.

How should I begin this ? Well, I'm a 31 year old man, looking for a committed long term relationship. The apps are terribly unkind (I've had a few matches, however) and people aren't willing to give each other a chance at all I feel. It's a bit of a catch-22 really, to build a connection with someone requires a little bit of patience and understanding, it's a two way street... So I figure I might as well try reddit, can't hurt right ?! I would like someone to show affection and a little bit of tenderness towards.

A little bit about me in dot point form:

* University educated, I have a double degree, engineering + science, now work in IT full time doing operations/infra work. 
* 173cm (5ft8in), black hair, brown eyes, I would call myself (somewhat?) conventionally attractive. I will let you decide that of course ! 
* Trying to get fitter, I go to the gym 4-5x a week, not overweight, but a little husky I guess? I have a powerlifting coach helping me to achieve a 2-plate bench within the next year. 
* I try to get enough sunshine, exercise, sleep, water, eat lots of fruit & veg. I hope you do too !
* Friendly, chatty, empathetic, curious, deep thinking (almost to a fault), emotionally available, honest and principled is how I would describe my character. 
* I prefer tea before coffee in the morning, I play acoustic guitar (but not enough, so I am terrible, still, I could sing you a song though !), I love my EDM of all varieties, trying to get my 5K time down, and I am also vegetarian. I drink socially. I have some vices, but happy to chat about that also. Just being upfront.
* Just fyi - never been in a relationship. I hope that's not a red flag ! It just hasn't happened, for whatever reason. 
* Progressive and left leaning, with some caveats, happy to explain. I believe in a higher power. 
* Not a gamer, into manga, anime, or super nerdy at all. I dont mind if you are though =)
* The book I am currently reading is *Siddhartha* by Herman Hesse. 

What I value, and hopefully you are:

* In that 25-35 age bracket, and from Australia. I don't mind where.
* Kind, curious, emotionally available, someone that rolls with the punches and doesn't sweat the small stuff.
* Employed, full time, preferably university educated.
* Looking for a monogamous, long-term relationship, built on mutually shared values, respect, integrity, and laughter (important!).
* I don't mind your cultural background, or skin colour. 
* Has an appreciation for science, art, music, technology ! 

Hopefully, we're not here for endless reddit chats lmao, shoot through a DM or chat request ! If we click, let’s meet in real life or close the gap if it’s a LDR (only open to this if it feels right), but lets talk ! I am happy to exchange pictures upon the first message =)

My dad was the only one in my family that understood me, got me, and cared for me. I love animals so much and I got that from him. 
One day when I was a young kid he brought home a huge american bullfrog in a folgers coffee can for me. He saw that frog and thought of me. He went and got the coffee can to catch it for ME. Only he would do that, because only he understood me.
My dad was not perfect though. He left when I was 10 because of his drinking. He drank with me and my brother in the car and rear ended someone. He left the next week, moved to Florida and kept telling me he’d be back in a couple weeks. He came back but only for Christmas every year. That was 8 years ago.
I’m 19 now but I haven’t seen him since I turned that age. 
He died July 17, 2025. I live with my mom and my brother, and they don’t speak of it. My mom has not once asked me how I feel since my dad died. My brother makes jokes. My dad didn’t care much for him anyways, must be why he makes the jokes. 
One day my dad walked in on me being SA’d by my brother and didn’t do anything. Just walked out furiously. My brother ran after him assuring him that he wasn’t doing anything wrong. Now that my dad’s dead I’ll never know if he scolded my brother or said anything to him. Knowing him, I like to believe he said SOMETHING on my behalf. I was only maybe 6 at the time.
I don’t like to think of that when I think of my dad though. I like to think of the man that loved animals as much as I do. The one I got to see every Christmas, and the one who made it feel Christmasy and gave me holiday cheer every year. 
Now he’s gone and I’m stuck with a mom and brother who I don’t like to be around. This will be my first Christmas ever without him. I miss him dearly and this is my first Christmas with a job so I would have been able to get him whatever he wanted. Can’t though.

1obe716,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1obe716,"Marshall Kilburn 3 - Finally Upgraded the Legend. Same Iconic Look, Way Better Guts.","**TL;DR:** *This speaker makes my entire music collection sound reborn. Battery lasts longer than a Mumbai-Delhi road trip. Music is laid back and warm, soothing to hear. Analytical music breakdown is in full review.*

*Namaste fellow audiophiles!* I know this subreddit basically deals with headphones but I had to do it of the fellow Audiophiles and Music Enthusiasts. This is gonna be longer than I planned because I got way too deep into speaker comparisons and my credit card is still recovering ;)

**Why I Even Considered Upgrading from Kilburn 2:**

I've been rocking the Marshall Kilburn 2 and Bose SoundLink Revolve II for years, and I simply love the aesthetics of Marshall and tonality of Bose. Was about to grab the Bose Soundlink Max because of the clean sound and form factor, or maybe Sonos Era 300 because, you know, Sonos ecosystem and all that. Then I saw the Kilburn 3 in a store and thought ""maybe it's time to get inked again and bulk muscle."" Sonos was expensive and Bose looked like a brick. Marshall was the middle ground. Ordered it, told myself ""if it's not worth it, I'll return it."" 

**First Impressions - The Design Hits Different:** 

Look, if you've seen a Marshall speaker, you know the vibe (ROLEX sirrr!). This looks *exactly* like the Kilburn 2; classic vintage Marshall amp aesthetic. Metal grill, faux leather accents, that iconic logo. I got the black version (cream looks beautiful too, but black just hits different for my setup).

Weight is 6 lbs (around 2.7 kg), comes with a guitar inspired leather strap. Solid build, IP54 rated so it survived my balcony's monsoon testing. The tactile knobs with LED indicators are pure *satisfaction*; bass, treble, volume, all visible at a glance. No fumbling with apps.

**The Battery Life is Legitimately Stupid:** 

50 HOURS. I'm not exaggerating. Charged it fully when I got it, been using it daily for morning coffee time, music sessions, evening chai time playlists—it's been TWO WEEKS and I've charged it only once. (Average use time 3-4hrs/day)

My Kilburn 2 used to die during weekend trips. This one? Absolutely mental.

Quick charge is brilliant too; plug it in for 20 minutes while you're getting ready, boom, 8 hours of juice. My MacBook dies faster. My enthusiasm for life dies faster. This thing just keeps going.

**Sound Quality - The Main Event:** 

This is where I need you to really pay attention because I spent *way* too much time on this.

**Test Setup:**

* Marshall Kilburn 3
* Marshall Kilburn 2 (my old one)
* Bose SoundLink Max (borrowed from a friend)
* Same room, same positioning, volume matched as closely as possible
* Test tracks across Hindi, English, classical, EDM, rock

**The Comparison Breakdown:**

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Marshall Kilburn 2:*

**Track 1: ""Kun Faya Kun"" - A.R. Rahman (Rockstar)**

*Kilburn 2:* The sufi vocals feels live, the bass has punch, but loose. The lower frequencies feel slightly restrained. The When A.R. Rahman's layers kick in during the chorus, there's a tiny bit of congestion in the mids. The bass feels ""dhummm, dhummm"" and instrument separation is not that distinctive.

*Kilburn 3:* Holy hell, the BASS. The guitar and harmonium hits cleaner. Javed Ali's vocals have more body and warmth. The tabla in the background? Crystal clear, separated beautifully. It sounds ""dumm, dumm"" (more tight) The soundstage feels wider: like the music is breathing. The Kilburn 2 was great, but this is *immersive*.

**Winner:** Kilburn 3, decisively.

**Track 2: ""Tum Se Hi"" - Mohit Chauhan (Jab We Met)**

*Kilburn 2:* Mohit's voice is warm, the acoustic guitar is pleasant, strings sound nice. Very listenable, no issues.

*Kilburn 3:* The acoustic guitar has more texture; you can *hear* the strings being plucked. Mohit's voice has better clarity in the higher registers. The string section in the background has more air and separation. It's subtle but noticeable.

**Winner:** Kilburn 3, but it's closer here.

**Track 3: ""Comfortably Numb"" - Pink Floyd**

*Kilburn 2:* David Gilmour's guitar solo is beautiful, but the sustain on those notes doesn't quite linger the way it should. Bass guitar is there but not ""felt.""

*Kilburn 3:* NOW we're talking. The bass guitar rumbles through your chest. Gilmour's guitar solo has that airy, soaring quality with better sustain. The drums during the climax hit with authority without muddying anything. Every instrument has its space.

**Winner:** Kilburn 3, no contest.

**Track 4: ""Hotel California"" - Eagles**

*Bose SoundLink Max:* The highs are *pristine*. The acoustic guitar intro has beautiful sparkle and airiness. Don Henley's vocals sit perfectly in the mix. The cymbals shimmer. BUT—and this is important—the bass feels polite, refined, almost held back. It's there, but not visceral.

*Marshall Kilburn 3:* The bass guitar has PRESENCE. You feel it. The electric guitars have warmth and body. The highs are very good (not quite Bose-level shimmer, I'll admit), but the overall presentation feels more ""live"" and energetic. Less refined, more exciting.

**Winner:** Depends on preference. Bose for analytical listening and that airy top-end. Marshall for laid-back and full-bodied sound.

**Track 5: ""Agar Tum Saath Ho"" - Arijit Singh (Tamasha)**

*Bose SoundLink Max:* Arijit's vocals are detailed, clear, and beautifully rendered. The higher notes have excellent extension and air. The instrumentation is well-separated. Very ""audiophile"" presentation.

*Marshall Kilburn 3:* Arijit's voice has more warmth and weight. The emotional delivery feels more intimate. The harmonium and strings feel closer, more present. The bass notes have more body. It's more *involving*.

**Winner:** Again, preference. Bose for clarity and detail. Marshall for warmth.

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Marshall Kilburn 2:*

* Kilburn 3 has borrowed the design language from Stanmore 3
* Turnable knobs are tactile and the power button click is satisfying
* Kilburn 3 has WAY better battery life (50hrs vs 20hrs - this alone is huge)
* Kilburn 3 has noticeably deeper, cleaner bass - the improvement is real in mids as well
* Kilburn 3 is louder without distortion; not muddy like Kilburn 2
* Kilburn 3 adds USB-C, power bank function, and better Bluetooth (5.3 vs 5.0)
* Both look equally vintage and awesome
* If you have the Kilburn 2 and it's working fine, maybe wait. But if you're buying new? Get the 3, no question

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Bose SoundLink Max:*

* Similar price point
* Bose has slightly better highs, I'll admit that
* Marshall has noticeably better bass and overall warmth
* The Bose feels more ""refined,"" the Marshall feels more ""alive""
* Bose has better app features and ecosystem
* For music, I chose the Marshall. My ears made the decision.

**Playing the same tracks across all three, the Marshall was the only one that made me FEEL the music.** 

**The Features That Actually Matter:**

* Huge Battery life
* Bluetooth 5.3 LE- connects instantly, stable AF
* Multipoint pairing - laptop and phone at the same time, seamless switching
* 3.5mm aux - for my one friend still living in 2010
* Marshall app is simple, clean EQ options
* The knobs are TACTILE. That power button click is *satisfying*
* *Sustainable as the Battery is replaceable*

**The Stuff That's Annoying:**

* **NO TWS:** This is my biggest gripe. You CANNOT pair two Kilburn 3s together. Why, Marshall? WHY? This would've been perfect for true stereo separation
* **AuraCast is glitchy:** Tried connecting it to other AuraCast devices. Total mess. Glitchy, wouldn't connect, gave up
* **No speakerphone:** No built-in mic, so can't take calls through it
* **Ecosystem basically doesn't exist:** If you want multiple speakers jamming together, JBL or Sonos is your answer

# Is it worth it at ₹35,990?

**If you DON'T own Kilburn 2:** Get the Kilburn 3 immediately. It's the better buy in 2025.

**If you OWN Kilburn 2 and it's working fine:** The upgrade is noticeable but not life-changing. The battery life alone might justify it if you travel a lot. Sound improvement is real but incremental. I'd say wait for a sale or if your Kilburn 2 starts showing age.

**If you're choosing between Kilburn 3 and Bose SoundLink Max:**

* Choose Bose if: You want the most detailed, analytical sound with beautiful highs. You care about ecosystem features.
* Choose Marshall if: You want impactful, warm, engaging sound with better bass. You value aesthetics and battery life (50hrs vs Bose's 20hrs).

But if you want the best-SOUNDING portable speaker in this price range, and you want it to look like an actual piece of your room instead of outdoor gear, this is it.

**The Verdict:** 9/10. Nothing is perfect and this isn't as well. This speaker made me fall in love with my entire music library again. From A.R. Rahman to Pink Floyd, from Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to Deadmau5; everything sounds *better*. The bass improvement over Kilburn 2 is substantial, the battery life is game-changing, and it looks stunning.

**At ₹35,990, it's not an impulse buy (don't be like me). But if you're serious about portable audio and want something that sounds phenomenal while looking like a piece of art, this is it.**

**Track 3: ""Comfortably Numb"" - Pink Floyd**

*Kilburn 2:* David Gilmour's guitar solo is beautiful, but the sustain on those notes doesn't quite linger the way it should. Bass guitar is there but not ""felt.""

*Kilburn 3:* NOW we're talking. The bass guitar rumbles through your chest. Gilmour's guitar solo has that airy, soaring quality with better sustain. The drums during the climax hit with authority without muddying anything. Every instrument has its space.

**Winner:** Kilburn 3, no contest.

**Track 4: ""Hotel California"" - Eagles**

*Bose SoundLink Max:* The highs are *pristine*. The acoustic guitar intro has beautiful sparkle and airiness. Don Henley's vocals sit perfectly in the mix. The cymbals shimmer. BUT—and this is important—the bass feels polite, refined, almost held back. It's there, but not visceral.

*Marshall Kilburn 3:* The bass guitar has PRESENCE. You feel it. The electric guitars have warmth and body. The highs are very good (not quite Bose-level shimmer, I'll admit), but the overall presentation feels more ""live"" and energetic. Less refined, more exciting.

**Winner:** Depends on preference. Bose for analytical listening and that airy top-end. Marshall for laid-back and full-bodied sound.

**Track 5: ""Agar Tum Saath Ho"" - Arijit Singh (Tamasha)**

*Bose SoundLink Max:* Arijit's vocals are detailed, clear, and beautifully rendered. The higher notes have excellent extension and air. The instrumentation is well-separated. Very ""audiophile"" presentation.

*Marshall Kilburn 3:* Arijit's voice has more warmth and weight. The emotional delivery feels more intimate. The harmonium and strings feel closer, more present. The bass notes have more body. It's more *involving*.

**Winner:** Again, preference. Bose for clarity and detail. Marshall for warmth.

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Marshall Kilburn 2:*

* Kilburn 3 has borrowed the design language from Stanmore 3
* Turnable knobs are tactile and the power button click is satisfying
* Kilburn 3 has WAY better battery life (50hrs vs 20hrs - this alone is huge)
* Kilburn 3 has noticeably deeper, cleaner bass - the improvement is real in mids as well
* Kilburn 3 is louder without distortion; not muddy like Kilburn 2
* Kilburn 3 adds USB-C, power bank function, and better Bluetooth (5.3 vs 5.0)
* Both look equally vintage and awesome
* If you have the Kilburn 2 and it's working fine, maybe wait. But if you're buying new? Get the 3, no question

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Bose SoundLink Max:*

* Similar price point
* Bose has slightly better highs, I'll admit that
* Marshall has noticeably better bass and overall warmth
* The Bose feels more ""refined,"" the Marshall feels more ""alive""
* Bose has better app features and ecosystem
* For music, I chose the Marshall. My ears made the decision.

**Playing the same tracks across all three, the Marshall was the only one that made me FEEL the music.** 

**The Features That Actually Matter:**

* Huge Battery life
* Bluetooth 5.3 LE- connects instantly, stable AF
* Multipoint pairing - laptop and phone at the same time, seamless switching
* 3.5mm aux - for my one friend still living in 2010
* Marshall app is simple, clean EQ options
* The knobs are TACTILE. That power button click is *satisfying*
* *Sustainable as the Battery is replaceable*

**The Stuff That's Annoying:**

* **NO TWS:** This is my biggest gripe. You CANNOT pair two Kilburn 3s together. Why, Marshall? WHY? This would've been perfect for true stereo separation
* **AuraCast is glitchy:** Tried connecting it to other AuraCast devices. Total mess. Glitchy, wouldn't connect, gave up
* **No speakerphone:** No built-in mic, so can't take calls through it
* **Ecosystem basically doesn't exist:** If you want multiple speakers jamming together, JBL or Sonos is your answer

# Is it worth it at ₹35,990?

**If you DON'T own Kilburn 2:** Get the Kilburn 3 immediately. It's the better buy in 2025.

**If you OWN Kilburn 2 and it's working fine:** The upgrade is noticeable but not life-changing. The battery life alone might justify it if you travel a lot. Sound improvement is real but incremental. I'd say wait for a sale or if your Kilburn 2 starts showing age.

**If you're choosing between Kilburn 3 and Bose SoundLink Max:**

* Choose Bose if: You want the most detailed, analytical sound with beautiful highs. You care about ecosystem features.
* Choose Marshall if: You want impactful, warm, engaging sound with better bass. You value aesthetics and battery life (50hrs vs Bose's 20hrs).

But if you want the best-SOUNDING portable speaker in this price range, and you want it to look like an actual piece of your room instead of outdoor gear, this is it.

**The Verdict:** 9/10. Nothing is perfect and this isn't as well. This speaker made me fall in love with my entire music library again. From A.R. Rahman to Pink Floyd, from Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to Deadmau5; everything sounds *better*. The bass improvement over Kilburn 2 is substantial, the battery life is game-changing, and it looks stunning.

**At ₹35,990, it's not an impulse buy (don't be like me). But if you're serious about portable audio and want something that sounds phenomenal while looking like a piece of art, this is it.**

I’m here to order a coffee on my lunch break. Then incomes Karen. Karen walks in from the side and stands with her friend, the lady in front of me paying for her order. She talks with her asking what she ordered etc.. it was all just a smoke and mirror conversation to try hide the fact she wanted to queue jump. Then her friend leaves and Karen is left there now ordering her lunch. My blood started to boil furiously! Karen had many questions about the menu too… then ordered coffee and asked for a loyalty card. I’m standing there and I swear the room was filling up with the steam billowing out of my ears! I needed to say something and decided I’d wait until she ordered just to make my point. So as she left I said to her to next time take her position in the queue rather than push in. Karen tried to pretend she didn’t realise there was an issue and said her and her friend had the same table number. I replied that that makes zero difference as she was ordering and paying separately. I also said I thought she knew exactly what she was doing.

Same Iconic Look, Way Better Guts.","**TL;DR:** *This speaker makes my entire music collection sound reborn. Battery lasts longer than a Mumbai-Delhi road trip. Music is laid back and warm, soothing to hear. Analytical music breakdown is in full review.*

*Namaste fellow audiophiles!* I know this subreddit basically deals with headphones but I had to do it of the fellow Audiophiles and Music Enthusiasts. This is gonna be longer than I planned because I got way too deep into speaker comparisons and my credit card is still recovering ;)

**Why I Even Considered Upgrading from Kilburn 2:**

I've been rocking the Marshall Kilburn 2 and Bose SoundLink Revolve II for years, and I simply love the aesthetics of Marshall and tonality of Bose. Was about to grab the Bose Soundlink Max because of the clean sound and form factor, or maybe Sonos Era 300 because, you know, Sonos ecosystem and all that. Then I saw the Kilburn 3 in a store and thought ""maybe it's time to get inked again and bulk muscle."" Sonos was expensive and Bose looked like a brick. Marshall was the middle ground. Ordered it, told myself ""if it's not worth it, I'll return it."" 

**First Impressions - The Design Hits Different:** 

Look, if you've seen a Marshall speaker, you know the vibe (ROLEX sirrr!). This looks *exactly* like the Kilburn 2; classic vintage Marshall amp aesthetic. Metal grill, faux leather accents, that iconic logo. I got the black version (cream looks beautiful too, but black just hits different for my setup).

Weight is 6 lbs (around 2.7 kg), comes with a guitar inspired leather strap. Solid build, IP54 rated so it survived my balcony's monsoon testing. The tactile knobs with LED indicators are pure *satisfaction*; bass, treble, volume, all visible at a glance. No fumbling with apps.

**The Battery Life is Legitimately Stupid:** 

50 HOURS. I'm not exaggerating. Charged it fully when I got it, been using it daily for morning coffee time, music sessions, evening chai time playlists—it's been TWO WEEKS and I've charged it only once. (Average use time 3-4hrs/day)

My Kilburn 2 used to die during weekend trips. This one? Absolutely mental.

Quick charge is brilliant too; plug it in for 20 minutes while you're getting ready, boom, 8 hours of juice. My MacBook dies faster. My enthusiasm for life dies faster. This thing just keeps going.

**Sound Quality - The Main Event:** 

This is where I need you to really pay attention because I spent *way* too much time on this.

**Test Setup:**

* Marshall Kilburn 3
* Marshall Kilburn 2 (my old one)
* Bose SoundLink Max (borrowed from a friend)
* Same room, same positioning, volume matched as closely as possible
* Test tracks across Hindi, English, classical, EDM, rock

**The Comparison Breakdown:**

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Marshall Kilburn 2:*

**Track 1: ""Kun Faya Kun"" - A.R. Rahman (Rockstar)**

*Kilburn 2:* The sufi vocals feels live, the bass has punch, but loose. The lower frequencies feel slightly restrained. The When A.R. Rahman's layers kick in during the chorus, there's a tiny bit of congestion in the mids. The bass feels ""dhummm, dhummm"" and instrument separation is not that distinctive.

*Kilburn 3:* Holy hell, the BASS. The guitar and harmonium hits cleaner. Javed Ali's vocals have more body and warmth. The tabla in the background? Crystal clear, separated beautifully. It sounds ""dumm, dumm"" (more tight) The soundstage feels wider: like the music is breathing. The Kilburn 2 was great, but this is *immersive*.

**Winner:** Kilburn 3, decisively.

**Track 2: ""Tum Se Hi"" - Mohit Chauhan (Jab We Met)**

*Kilburn 2:* Mohit's voice is warm, the acoustic guitar is pleasant, strings sound nice. Very listenable, no issues.

*Kilburn 3:* The acoustic guitar has more texture; you can *hear* the strings being plucked. Mohit's voice has better clarity in the higher registers. The string section in the background has more air and separation. It's subtle but noticeable.

Quick charge is brilliant too; plug it in for 20 minutes while you're getting ready, boom, 8 hours of juice. My MacBook dies faster. My enthusiasm for life dies faster. This thing just keeps going.

**Sound Quality - The Main Event:** 

This is where I need you to really pay attention because I spent *way* too much time on this.

**Test Setup:**

* Marshall Kilburn 3
* Marshall Kilburn 2 (my old one)
* Bose SoundLink Max (borrowed from a friend)
* Same room, same positioning, volume matched as closely as possible
* Test tracks across Hindi, English, classical, EDM, rock

**The Comparison Breakdown:**

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Marshall Kilburn 2:*

**Track 1: ""Kun Faya Kun"" - A.R. Rahman (Rockstar)**

*Kilburn 2:* The sufi vocals feels live, the bass has punch, but loose. The lower frequencies feel slightly restrained. The When A.R. Rahman's layers kick in during the chorus, there's a tiny bit of congestion in the mids. The bass feels ""dhummm, dhummm"" and instrument separation is not that distinctive.

*Kilburn 3:* Holy hell, the BASS. The guitar and harmonium hits cleaner. Javed Ali's vocals have more body and warmth. The tabla in the background? Crystal clear, separated beautifully. It sounds ""dumm, dumm"" (more tight) The soundstage feels wider: like the music is breathing. The Kilburn 2 was great, but this is *immersive*.

**Winner:** Kilburn 3, decisively.

**Track 2: ""Tum Se Hi"" - Mohit Chauhan (Jab We Met)**

*Kilburn 2:* Mohit's voice is warm, the acoustic guitar is pleasant, strings sound nice. Very listenable, no issues.

*Kilburn 3:* The acoustic guitar has more texture; you can *hear* the strings being plucked. Mohit's voice has better clarity in the higher registers. The string section in the background has more air and separation. It's subtle but noticeable.

**Winner:** Kilburn 3, but it's closer here.

**Track 3: ""Comfortably Numb"" - Pink Floyd**

*Kilburn 2:* David Gilmour's guitar solo is beautiful, but the sustain on those notes doesn't quite linger the way it should. Bass guitar is there but not ""felt.""

*Kilburn 3:* NOW we're talking. The bass guitar rumbles through your chest. Gilmour's guitar solo has that airy, soaring quality with better sustain. The drums during the climax hit with authority without muddying anything. Every instrument has its space.

**Winner:** Kilburn 3, no contest.

**Track 4: ""Hotel California"" - Eagles**

*Bose SoundLink Max:* The highs are *pristine*. The acoustic guitar intro has beautiful sparkle and airiness. Don Henley's vocals sit perfectly in the mix. The cymbals shimmer. BUT—and this is important—the bass feels polite, refined, almost held back. It's there, but not visceral.

*Marshall Kilburn 3:* The bass guitar has PRESENCE. You feel it. The electric guitars have warmth and body. The highs are very good (not quite Bose-level shimmer, I'll admit), but the overall presentation feels more ""live"" and energetic. Less refined, more exciting.

**Winner:** Depends on preference. Bose for analytical listening and that airy top-end. Marshall for laid-back and full-bodied sound.

**Track 5: ""Agar Tum Saath Ho"" - Arijit Singh (Tamasha)**

*Bose SoundLink Max:* Arijit's vocals are detailed, clear, and beautifully rendered. The higher notes have excellent extension and air. The instrumentation is well-separated. Very ""audiophile"" presentation.

*Marshall Kilburn 3:* Arijit's voice has more warmth and weight. The emotional delivery feels more intimate. The harmonium and strings feel closer, more present. The bass notes have more body. It's more *involving*.

**Winner:** Again, preference. Bose for clarity and detail. Marshall for warmth.

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Marshall Kilburn 2:*

* Kilburn 3 has borrowed the design language from Stanmore 3
* Turnable knobs are tactile and the power button click is satisfying
* Kilburn 3 has WAY better battery life (50hrs vs 20hrs - this alone is huge)
* Kilburn 3 has noticeably deeper, cleaner bass - the improvement is real in mids as well
* Kilburn 3 is louder without distortion; not muddy like Kilburn 2
* Kilburn 3 adds USB-C, power bank function, and better Bluetooth (5.3 vs 5.0)
* Both look equally vintage and awesome
* If you have the Kilburn 2 and it's working fine, maybe wait. But if you're buying new? Get the 3, no question

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Bose SoundLink Max:*

* Similar price point
* Bose has slightly better highs, I'll admit that
* Marshall has noticeably better bass and overall warmth
* The Bose feels more ""refined,"" the Marshall feels more ""alive""
* Bose has better app features and ecosystem
* For music, I chose the Marshall. My ears made the decision.

**Playing the same tracks across all three, the Marshall was the only one that made me FEEL the music.** 

**The Features That Actually Matter:**

* Huge Battery life
* Bluetooth 5.3 LE- connects instantly, stable AF
* Multipoint pairing - laptop and phone at the same time, seamless switching
* 3.5mm aux - for my one friend still living in 2010
* Marshall app is simple, clean EQ options
* The knobs are TACTILE. That power button click is *satisfying*
* *Sustainable as the Battery is replaceable*

**The Stuff That's Annoying:**

* **NO TWS:** This is my biggest gripe. You CANNOT pair two Kilburn 3s together. Why, Marshall? WHY? This would've been perfect for true stereo separation
* **AuraCast is glitchy:** Tried connecting it to other AuraCast devices. Total mess. Glitchy, wouldn't connect, gave up
* **No speakerphone:** No built-in mic, so can't take calls through it
* **Ecosystem basically doesn't exist:** If you want multiple speakers jamming together, JBL or Sonos is your answer

# Is it worth it at ₹35,990?

**If you DON'T own Kilburn 2:** Get the Kilburn 3 immediately. It's the better buy in 2025.

**If you OWN Kilburn 2 and it's working fine:** The upgrade is noticeable but not life-changing. The battery life alone might justify it if you travel a lot. Sound improvement is real but incremental. I'd say wait for a sale or if your Kilburn 2 starts showing age.

**If you're choosing between Kilburn 3 and Bose SoundLink Max:**

* Choose Bose if: You want the most detailed, analytical sound with beautiful highs. You care about ecosystem features.
* Choose Marshall if: You want impactful, warm, engaging sound with better bass. You value aesthetics and battery life (50hrs vs Bose's 20hrs).

But if you want the best-SOUNDING portable speaker in this price range, and you want it to look like an actual piece of your room instead of outdoor gear, this is it.

**The Verdict:** 9/10. Nothing is perfect and this isn't as well. This speaker made me fall in love with my entire music library again. From A.R. Rahman to Pink Floyd, from Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to Deadmau5; everything sounds *better*. The bass improvement over Kilburn 2 is substantial, the battery life is game-changing, and it looks stunning.

**At ₹35,990, it's not an impulse buy (don't be like me). But if you're serious about portable audio and want something that sounds phenomenal while looking like a piece of art, this is it.**

Same Iconic Look, Way Better Guts.","**TL;DR:** *This speaker makes my entire music collection sound reborn. Battery lasts longer than a Mumbai-Delhi road trip. Music is laid back and warm, soothing to hear. Analytical music breakdown is in full review.*

*Namaste fellow audiophiles!* I know this subreddit basically deals with headphones but I had to do it of the fellow Audiophiles and Music Enthusiasts. This is gonna be longer than I planned because I got way too deep into speaker comparisons and my credit card is still recovering ;)

**Why I Even Considered Upgrading from Kilburn 2:**

I've been rocking the Marshall Kilburn 2 and Bose SoundLink Revolve II for years, and I simply love the aesthetics of Marshall and tonality of Bose. Was about to grab the Bose Soundlink Max because of the clean sound and form factor, or maybe Sonos Era 300 because, you know, Sonos ecosystem and all that. Then I saw the Kilburn 3 in a store and thought ""maybe it's time to get inked again and bulk muscle."" Sonos was expensive and Bose looked like a brick. Marshall was the middle ground. Ordered it, told myself ""if it's not worth it, I'll return it."" 

**First Impressions - The Design Hits Different:** 

Look, if you've seen a Marshall speaker, you know the vibe (ROLEX sirrr!). This looks *exactly* like the Kilburn 2; classic vintage Marshall amp aesthetic. Metal grill, faux leather accents, that iconic logo. I got the black version (cream looks beautiful too, but black just hits different for my setup).

Weight is 6 lbs (around 2.7 kg), comes with a guitar inspired leather strap. Solid build, IP54 rated so it survived my balcony's monsoon testing. The tactile knobs with LED indicators are pure *satisfaction*; bass, treble, volume, all visible at a glance. No fumbling with apps.

**The Battery Life is Legitimately Stupid:** 

50 HOURS. I'm not exaggerating. Charged it fully when I got it, been using it daily for morning coffee time, music sessions, evening chai time playlists—it's been TWO WEEKS and I've charged it only once. (Average use time 3-4hrs/day)

**Sound Quality - The Main Event:** 

This is where I need you to really pay attention because I spent *way* too much time on this.

**Test Setup:**

* Marshall Kilburn 3
* Marshall Kilburn 2 (my old one)
* Bose SoundLink Max (borrowed from a friend)
* Same room, same positioning, volume matched as closely as possible
* Test tracks across Hindi, English, classical, EDM, rock

**The Comparison Breakdown:**

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Marshall Kilburn 2:*

**Track 1: ""Kun Faya Kun"" - A.R. Rahman (Rockstar)**

*Kilburn 2:* The sufi vocals feels live, the bass has punch, but loose. The lower frequencies feel slightly restrained. The When A.R. Rahman's layers kick in during the chorus, there's a tiny bit of congestion in the mids. The bass feels ""dhummm, dhummm"" and instrument separation is not that distinctive.

*Kilburn 3:* Holy hell, the BASS. The guitar and harmonium hits cleaner. Javed Ali's vocals have more body and warmth. The tabla in the background? Crystal clear, separated beautifully. It sounds ""dumm, dumm"" (more tight) The soundstage feels wider: like the music is breathing. The Kilburn 2 was great, but this is *immersive*.

**Winner:** Kilburn 3, decisively.

**Track 2: ""Tum Se Hi"" - Mohit Chauhan (Jab We Met)**

*Kilburn 2:* Mohit's voice is warm, the acoustic guitar is pleasant, strings sound nice. Very listenable, no issues.

*Kilburn 3:* The acoustic guitar has more texture; you can *hear* the strings being plucked. Mohit's voice has better clarity in the higher registers. The string section in the background has more air and separation. It's subtle but noticeable.

**Winner:** Kilburn 3, but it's closer here.

**Track 3: ""Comfortably Numb"" - Pink Floyd**

*Kilburn 2:* David Gilmour's guitar solo is beautiful, but the sustain on those notes doesn't quite linger the way it should. Bass guitar is there but not ""felt.""

*Kilburn 3:* NOW we're talking. The bass guitar rumbles through your chest. Gilmour's guitar solo has that airy, soaring quality with better sustain. The drums during the climax hit with authority without muddying anything. Every instrument has its space.

**Winner:** Kilburn 3, no contest.

**Track 4: ""Hotel California"" - Eagles**

*Bose SoundLink Max:* The highs are *pristine*. The acoustic guitar intro has beautiful sparkle and airiness. Don Henley's vocals sit perfectly in the mix. The cymbals shimmer. BUT—and this is important—the bass feels polite, refined, almost held back. It's there, but not visceral.

*Marshall Kilburn 3:* The bass guitar has PRESENCE. You feel it. The electric guitars have warmth and body. The highs are very good (not quite Bose-level shimmer, I'll admit), but the overall presentation feels more ""live"" and energetic. Less refined, more exciting.

**Winner:** Depends on preference. Bose for analytical listening and that airy top-end. Marshall for laid-back and full-bodied sound.

**Track 5: ""Agar Tum Saath Ho"" - Arijit Singh (Tamasha)**

*Bose SoundLink Max:* Arijit's vocals are detailed, clear, and beautifully rendered. The higher notes have excellent extension and air. The instrumentation is well-separated. Very ""audiophile"" presentation.

*Marshall Kilburn 3:* Arijit's voice has more warmth and weight. The emotional delivery feels more intimate. The harmonium and strings feel closer, more present. The bass notes have more body. It's more *involving*.

**Winner:** Again, preference. Bose for clarity and detail. Marshall for warmth.

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Marshall Kilburn 2:*

* Kilburn 3 has borrowed the design language from Stanmore 3
* Turnable knobs are tactile and the power button click is satisfying
* Kilburn 3 has WAY better battery life (50hrs vs 20hrs - this alone is huge)
* Kilburn 3 has noticeably deeper, cleaner bass - the improvement is real in mids as well
* Kilburn 3 is louder without distortion; not muddy like Kilburn 2
* Kilburn 3 adds USB-C, power bank function, and better Bluetooth (5.3 vs 5.0)
* Both look equally vintage and awesome
* If you have the Kilburn 2 and it's working fine, maybe wait. But if you're buying new? Get the 3, no question

*Marshall Kilburn 3 vs Bose SoundLink Max:*

* Similar price point
* Bose has slightly better highs, I'll admit that
* Marshall has noticeably better bass and overall warmth
* The Bose feels more ""refined,"" the Marshall feels more ""alive""
* Bose has better app features and ecosystem
* For music, I chose the Marshall. My ears made the decision.

**Playing the same tracks across all three, the Marshall was the only one that made me FEEL the music.** 

**The Features That Actually Matter:**

* Huge Battery life
* Bluetooth 5.3 LE- connects instantly, stable AF
* Multipoint pairing - laptop and phone at the same time, seamless switching
* 3.5mm aux - for my one friend still living in 2010
* Marshall app is simple, clean EQ options
* The knobs are TACTILE. That power button click is *satisfying*
* *Sustainable as the Battery is replaceable*

**The Stuff That's Annoying:**

* **NO TWS:** This is my biggest gripe. You CANNOT pair two Kilburn 3s together. Why, Marshall? WHY? This would've been perfect for true stereo separation
* **AuraCast is glitchy:** Tried connecting it to other AuraCast devices. Total mess. Glitchy, wouldn't connect, gave up
* **No speakerphone:** No built-in mic, so can't take calls through it
* **Ecosystem basically doesn't exist:** If you want multiple speakers jamming together, JBL or Sonos is your answer

# Is it worth it at ₹35,990?

**If you DON'T own Kilburn 2:** Get the Kilburn 3 immediately. It's the better buy in 2025.

**If you OWN Kilburn 2 and it's working fine:** The upgrade is noticeable but not life-changing. The battery life alone might justify it if you travel a lot. Sound improvement is real but incremental. I'd say wait for a sale or if your Kilburn 2 starts showing age.

**If you're choosing between Kilburn 3 and Bose SoundLink Max:**

* Choose Bose if: You want the most detailed, analytical sound with beautiful highs. You care about ecosystem features.
* Choose Marshall if: You want impactful, warm, engaging sound with better bass. You value aesthetics and battery life (50hrs vs Bose's 20hrs).

But if you want the best-SOUNDING portable speaker in this price range, and you want it to look like an actual piece of your room instead of outdoor gear, this is it.

**The Verdict:** 9/10. Nothing is perfect and this isn't as well. This speaker made me fall in love with my entire music library again. From A.R. Rahman to Pink Floyd, from Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to Deadmau5; everything sounds *better*. The bass improvement over Kilburn 2 is substantial, the battery life is game-changing, and it looks stunning.

**At ₹35,990, it's not an impulse buy (don't be like me). But if you're serious about portable audio and want something that sounds phenomenal while looking like a piece of art, this is it.**

1obe3b3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1obe3b3,"Marshall Kilburn 3 - Finally Upgraded the Legend. Same Iconic Look, Way Better Guts.","**TL;DR:** *This speaker makes my entire music collection sound reborn. Battery lasts longer than a Mumbai-Delhi road trip. Music is laid back and warm, soothing to hear. Analytical music breakdown is in full review.*

*Namaste fellow audiophiles!* I know this subreddit basically deals with headphones but I had to do it of the fellow Audiophiles and Music Enthusiasts. This is gonna be longer than I planned because I got way too deep into speaker comparisons and my credit card is still recovering ;)

**Why I Even Considered Upgrading from Kilburn 2:**

I've been rocking the Marshall Kilburn 2 and Bose SoundLink Revolve II for years, and I simply love the aesthetics of Marshall and tonality of Bose. Was about to grab the Bose Soundlink Max because of the clean sound and form factor, or maybe Sonos Era 300 because, you know, Sonos ecosystem and all that. Then I saw the Kilburn 3 in a store and thought ""maybe it's time to get inked again and bulk muscle."" Sonos was expensive and Bose looked like a brick. Marshall was the middle ground. Ordered it, told myself ""if it's not worth it, I'll return it."" 

**First Impressions - The Design Hits Different:** 

Look, if you've seen a Marshall speaker, you know the vibe (ROLEX sirrr!). This looks *exactly* like the Kilburn 2; classic vintage Marshall amp aesthetic. Metal grill, faux leather accents, that iconic logo. I got the black version (cream looks beautiful too, but black just hits different for my setup).

Weight is 6 lbs (around 2.7 kg), comes with a guitar inspired leather strap. Solid build, IP54 rated so it survived my balcony's monsoon testing. The tactile knobs with LED indicators are pure *satisfaction*; bass, treble, volume, all visible at a glance. No fumbling with apps.

**The Battery Life is Legitimately Stupid:** 

50 HOURS. I'm not exaggerating. Charged it fully when I got it, been using it daily for morning coffee time, music sessions, evening chai time playlists—it's been TWO WEEKS and I've charged it only once. (Average use time 3-4hrs/day)

1obe2k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/skateboardarts/comments/1obe2k8/understanding_premium_art_deck_pricing_investment/,Understanding Premium Art Deck Pricing: Investment or Indulgence?,"The price tags on premium skateboard art often raise eyebrows. A deck featuring a classical masterpiece reproduction can cost €120 to €280 – significantly more than functional skateboards intended for actual riding. To understand this pricing, we need to examine what separates collectible art decks from mass-market alternatives and why discerning collectors consider them worthwhile investments.

The conversation around value in skateboard art mirrors broader discussions in the art world about authenticity, craftsmanship, and the intangible qualities that transform objects into meaningful cultural artifacts.

**The Materials Foundation**

Premium Canadian maple construction forms the baseline for quality art decks. While cheaper alternatives use mixed hardwoods or lower-grade maple, top-tier art decks source specifically from Canadian forests known for producing the densest, most consistent wood. This selectivity increases costs but ensures the canvas worthy of museum-quality reproduction.

The seven-ply pressing process for premium decks involves precise temperature and pressure control, specialized adhesives that won't yellow or degrade over time, and quality inspection that rejects boards with even minor imperfections. Mass production can't accommodate this level of attention – it's economically unfeasible at scale.

**Reproduction Technology and Licensing**

High-resolution art reproduction represents significant investment. Capturing a masterpiece like Klimt's ""The Kiss"" or Caravaggio's ""Medusa"" requires professional photography or digital scanning at resolutions far exceeding standard commercial printing. Color correction to match the original artwork demands expertise and sophisticated equipment.

For contemporary artworks still under copyright, licensing fees add substantial costs. Even public domain works require investment in creating print-ready files that preserve the subtlety and nuance of the original paintings. This preparatory work often costs thousands before a single deck is printed.

**Small Batch Economics**

Art deck production typically involves limited runs rather than mass manufacturing. While a major skateboard brand might produce tens of thousands of identical decks, premium art deck makers often work in batches of dozens or hundreds. This small-scale production eliminates economies of scale, increasing per-unit costs across materials, setup, and labor.

Limited production also means specialized knowledge rather than assembly-line automation. Craftspeople who understand both skateboard construction and art reproduction command appropriate compensation for their expertise.

**The Curation Premium**

Thoughtful curation adds value that's easy to overlook. Selecting which artworks translate effectively to skateboard format, determining appropriate cropping and scaling, making design decisions about how classical compositions adapt to the deck's unique proportions – this creative direction requires genuine expertise in both art history and design.

Poor curation results in awkward reproductions that neither honor the original artwork nor function aesthetically as skateboard graphics. The best art deck producers employ designers who understand compositional principles, color theory, and the specific challenges of the skateboard canvas.

**Durability and Longevity**

Premium construction ensures art decks maintain their beauty for decades. The protective clear coats used on quality decks resist UV fading, moisture damage, and the yellowing that plagues cheaper alternatives. This longevity transforms what might seem expensive initially into reasonable cost-per-year of ownership.

A €200 art deck that remains vibrant and structurally sound for twenty years represents €10 annually – less than most people spend on coffee in a single month. Framed art prints of comparable quality often cost similar amounts while lacking skateboard art's unique cultural resonance.

**The Alternative Art Market**

Comparing skateboard art pricing to other collectible art categories reveals interesting perspectives. Original paintings by emerging artists often start at several thousand euros. Limited edition prints from established artists can cost hundreds or thousands. High-quality art photography commands similar prices.

Against this context, premium art decks offering museum-quality reproductions at €120-280 represent accessible entry points into serious art collecting. The skateboard format adds cultural significance and display versatility that straight reproductions cannot match.

**Investment Potential**

While not all art decks appreciate in value, limited editions from respected producers show promising investment characteristics. As skateboard art gains cultural legitimacy and museum recognition, early collectors may find their carefully chosen pieces significantly appreciate.

The key lies in selectivity – choosing pieces that combine artistic significance, production quality, and cultural relevance. Mass-produced decks with trendy graphics likely won't appreciate, but thoughtfully curated classical reproductions in limited runs show genuine investment potential.

**The Intangible Value**

Beyond materials and craftsmanship lies something harder to quantify: the emotional and cultural value of owning meaningful art. A Frida Kahlo deck doesn't just display beautiful imagery – it connects the owner to Mexican surrealism, feminist artistic traditions, and the intersection of high art with street culture.

This cultural resonance has genuine value, even if it doesn't appear on balance sheets. For collectors who appreciate both classical art and skateboarding culture, premium art decks occupy unique psychological territory that justifies premium pricing.

**Comparative Value Analysis**

Consider what else €200 might purchase: several mass-market prints that will fade within years, a single nice dinner for two, a mid-range fashion item, or a few cheap skateboards that will break or delaminate. Against these alternatives, a premium art deck offering decades of aesthetic pleasure and cultural significance presents compelling value.

**The Expertise Premium**

Companies producing premium art decks often employ art historians, professional designers, and master craftspeople. This expertise ensures faithful reproduction, appropriate adaptation, and construction quality. While mass-market producers can eliminate these costs through automation and lower standards, they cannot replicate the results.

**Resources for Further Exploration:**
- Art market analysis and investment guides
- Comparative studies of collectible categories
- Materials science research on wood durability and art preservation
- For examples of thoughtfully curated art deck collections demonstrating the relationship between quality and pricing, producers like deckarts.com showcase how premium materials and expert curation justify investment-level pricing

**Discussion Question:**
At what price point does skateboard art transition from impulse purchase to considered investment? Do you think the cultural cachet of owning art decks justifies premium pricing, or should art remain accessible regardless of production costs?",1,1760946953.0,skateboardarts,0,1.0,False

Well recently I’ve been tapering down a certain antidepressant causing me to feel nauseous all the time especially when I smell certain things, coffee being one of them🥲 I’ve quickly switched to a certain caffeine-free energy drink, at first because it was one of the few drinks I could have and not feel nauseous, but it’s not helping the caffeine withdrawal and I’m just so sleepy all the time and it feels impossible to get through the work day unless I’m like super busy. (unrelated but their new recipe now has caffeine and it doesn’t taste right)

The other thing is that I actually enjoy making coffee (I hand grind my beans and use an aeropress etc.) and visiting different coffee shops and have worked as a barista in the past. it’s hard to find decaf beans of the same price that actually taste good (if anyone from the UK has any decaf coffee recommendations that taste good and aren’t like £12.5 per 250g bag that would be super welcome).

I recently had a coffee chat with a managing partner from one of the mid-tier firms.

After the interview, HR mentioned that they’ll get back to me in a week or two with an update. The managing partner also connected me with another partner who specialises in tax, and I had a really nice chat too.

I’m just wondering whether is it normal to be invited for an interview when there aren’t any current openings? Do you think it could be a positive sign that they’re keeping me in mind for future opportunities? I’m an international student, so I’m still learning how things usually work here in Australia.

But we all know the real number is much, much higher.

It's not just work pressure. It's the anxiety and isolation that come with it. In our 20s, making ""friends"" often means building an army of acquaintances - people who might be useful one day.

As humans, we're hardwired for connection. When that's missing, we fall apart. Loneliness becomes a constant, not a choice.

We made the move because we didn’t want to keep wondering “what if?” But now that I’m back, I have to admit, it’s not as amazing as I thought it would be.

Sure, it’s great being close to family and old friends again, but beyond that, it all feels a bit bland. In the UK, I was constantly travelling, surrounded by history and deep culture. There was always something new to see or someone new to meet. Now I feel like I’ve just slipped back into my old life, and nothing’s really changed.

People here seem so shut off from the rest of the world, you can’t have a proper conversation about global topics. The social circles are quite cliquey, the humour doesn’t hit the same, and there’s this general lack of culture and community spirit. 

And don’t get me started on the pubs. So many of them are just big, soulless pokies venues now. There’s not much to do besides the same daily routine…get up early, go for a coffee, maybe hit the beach, and repeat. It’s nice, but it gets monotonous fast. 

I really wish I didn’t feel this way. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had a good time so far but I miss my previous life I had in the UK. Has anyone else gone through the same issues and feelings as I’m currently going through? How did you get through it?",4,1760946558.0,expats,3,1.0,False

1obdy5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1obdy5b/friend_i_have_toddlers_a_year_apart/,Friend & I have toddlers a year apart -,"Hi! 

My toddler is 15 months old and my friends toddler is a little over 2 years old. They’re about a year apart. 

I have voiced concern for his behavior towards my toddler before and she assured me things were changing and they were correcting his behavior. They gave my husband and I permission to discipline when they’re at our house and he is doing things we don’t allow (specifically in the past hitting and pushing). 

Today, I babysat him from 10a-5:15p so they could have a day out. I wanted to do this for them since they’re getting ready to have baby number 2 and don’t get a ton of time for themselves. 

Within 20 minutes of him being there he had repeatedly kicked, hit, pushed, threw toys at, screamed at, and bit my toddler. His mom and dad said short time outs were fine, so I removed him from the situation and set him in my daughters room in a pack and play (so he is safe and not harming himself or anyone else but monitored) while he calmed down. In the process he hit me several times and kicked me. He’s a kid with big feelings he doesn’t understand, I get it. 

As soon as he was calm I went in and talked to him. He said sorry to me and hugged me, I explained he wasn’t nice to my daughter and hurt her. He went and gave her a hug and said sorry. He started playing with a shape sorter that’s like an electronic picnic basket, and my daughter sat down next to him and tried to give him a hug. He said no and shoved her down and kicked her. I stepped in again and told him we were going to go back upstairs and he grabbed the picnic basket and smashed it into my daughters head.

She’s obviously hysterically crying and just wants me and he is shoving her down as she’s toddling over to me. I put him back upstairs and repeated the situation, he calmed down, we went back downstairs and I asked him to say sorry and he said no. I said he really hurt her (she now has a welt on her head and her dad is pissed) and it wasn’t nice. He said it was funny and shoved her into the coffee table and bit her while tackling her (laying on top of her).

I ended up picking up my daughter and not setting her back down the rest of the day. She was not safe with him and this was a big problem. He continued to hit me and try to hit her in the face because I wouldn’t turn on the tv for him. I understand they have cartoons on all the time in his house but we don’t do that here and I’m not going to turn them on and reward his behavior. 

When his parents came to pick him up I explained everything that happened and they said “he never does that” when he has very much done it all the time to her when they’re around - verifiable by several people. They said “he’s not a bully” which I never even said, I just said he would benefit from redirection. I’m very worried about their future little girl with how he acts towards my daughter and thinks it’s okay. 

They left and I got a text an hour later saying they asked the toddler if he did what I said “he said no” so they think I’m not telling the truth. They also said he said I “hurt him” and when they asked if I hurt my daughter he said yes. 

I feel so heartbroken and hurt because even through all this I did my absolute best to keep my cool. I don’t yell, I don’t hit my child. I do short time outs and cooldowns and redirection. Im laying in bed crying right now over this because it hurts my heart so bad to be accused of hurting my child or their child. I tried for my baby for 7 years and almost lost her in the nicu, I try to be the best mom I can be.

She said her child never lies and has no reason to here but they had told him he would be “in big trouble” when they got home. 

What would you do in this situation? I think at the very minimum our children do not need to be playing with one another anymore. But is this friendship ending?",2,1760946537.0,toddlers,9,1.0,False

I have been taking it around 9am on an empty stomach as I don't eat breakfast and the first meal of the day I have is lunch at 12pm.

I've noticed when taking it on an empty stomach I really feel it coming on and I can feel a little bit anxious and jittery but then it levels out after that.

I'm noticing I'm feeling a bit tired in the afternoon taking it this way and sometimes need a nap.

My day doesn't basically start until after 12pm so I'm going to take it 30 minutes before I eat my lunch today and see how that works and then I'll try it with lunch over the next few days.

I don't have trouble sleeping because I take Mirtazapine at night and that puts me to sleep within half an hour.

Also I'm trying to work coffee back in I seem to be alright with tea but it's not the same and I know people recommend no caffeine but it's something I really enjoy.

I don't drink anymore and I don't eat junk food etc.. 

I'm planning on just having one morning coffee at 8am and then taking the Elvanse at 12 as mentioned.

I’m currently on 36mg Concerta, about 3 months in. I still remember my first week on 18mg - the euphoria was incredible. I felt happy, focused, and almost unstoppable. But after about 3 weeks, the effect faded completely - no motivation, more procrastination.

My doctor then bumped me up to 36mg, and I’ve been on that since. Thing is, I’ve noticed that I only feel that same drive and motivation when I take Concerta with coffee. There’s a distinct euphoria and push that gets me going. But if I take coffee alone (without Concerta), it doesn’t do much. And Concerta alone also feels flat - just slightly better than without it. Without Concerta, I’ll probably just lay around and do nothing the whole day.

Has anyone else experienced this?
Does it mean my dose might be too low, or that the caffeine is somehow enhancing the dopamine effect?
Would love to hear how others have dealt with this - whether you adjusted your dose or found other ways to maintain the same focus and motivation.",1,1760946412.0,Concerta,1,1.0,False

I took my first does (.25ml) Sunday morning at 7:30 am, by 9:30 was not even interested in my morning coffee.   No desire to eat breakfast or lunch, or even drink water.    I forced my self to eat a Gatorade Protein bar at 1:30 and drank 16 oz of water in 10 min or so.  

Now to be fair, we were at a Halloween party the night before, and I was felling less than great in the morning, but I was not feeling sick or anything, mild hangover at worst.  

Nausea started at 8:30am, first vomit at 9:30am, but everything was fine after that.   Then it hit me. 

Stomach pain about 15 min after finishing the bar and water.  Nausea started at 2:30 , vomit at 2:45

Then the worst cycle.  
6:30, 7:30, 8:30, 9:30, 11, 2:30am … vomiting.   Mostly the water and that protein bar.   

I managed a sugar cookie and sips of ginger ale around 11:30, that came up at 2:30.  

It is now 3:40am, I have called in sick for tomorrow.   Is this going to settle down do I can drink some water and eat a banana or something?   

It seems very odd to have such a reaction so quickly.   I have zero desire to eat of drink, but I know I need to do both. 

This sucks.   I guess that protein bar was a bad decision, but at the moment it seemed like an easy way to get some calories and protein.  I was not hungry, but knew I needed to eat.   Ugh.

1obduun,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1obduun/my_best_friend_dated_my_brother_behind_my_back/,My best friend dated my brother behind my back… it’s been over a year and I’m still not over it,"Hi everyone. 

Back in my sophomore year of high school, I met a girl at my dance studio. Let’s call her Fiona. She was a grade below me in school, but we were in the same classes at dance. 

Fiona also went to my high school. She is academically gifted and so she was taking classes a year ahead. Because of this, we had classes together throughout high school. 

Although we met during my sophomore year, we didn’t really become close friends until part way through my junior year. We had classes together, danced together, and we were both on a leadership team for a popular club at my school. Unsurprisingly, this pushed us closer and closer together, and she was my best friend before I knew it. 

Fiona and I would drive to dance together every Friday after school. We would stop for coffee, get ready together, and then head to dance. We would sometimes skip dance to hang out, and we would often drive around after dance, getting food or having deep conversations. 

We would talk about absolutely everything. We had so many overlapping friends and activities, and so we never ran out of things to talk about. I opened up to her about every aspect of my life, and she did the same for me. She knew about certain extremely personal issues I had with my parents, my boyfriend, and my friends. I knew about the intense academic pressure she was constantly faced with, and how strict her parents were. It seemed like such a perfect friendship. Adding up the number of hours we’ve spent together, I don’t think I’ve spent more time with almost any non-family member than I have with Fiona.

Now I have to talk about my brother and his role in this situation. He is a year older than me. Let’s call him Andrew. Back when I was a junior in high school and he was a senior, Fiona and I began our routine of driving together to dance. Since Andrew also went to our high school and him and I shared a car, he would hang out with us before dropping us off at dance every Friday and then driving the car home. After dance, he would often pick us up and the three of us would hang out for the entire evening before we would drop her off at home. 

Aside from Fridays, the three of us would hang out together in other situations as well.  We would go on adventures after school a couple days a week. We had a pact that whenever one of us got into a fight with our parents, the three of us would drop everything and we would hang out, get a sweet treat, and decompress. 

I started to get weird vibes in May of my junior year. In mid-May, my dance studio put on the spring performance that we had been rehearsing for since January. We had put in hours of rehearsal multiple days a week for months. On the day of the performance, Fiona texted me informing me that she was sick. This prompted an emergency re-blocking rehearsal, and we all felt bad that Fiona had to miss out on the performance, which she had been working so hard on. She told me she had an extremely high fever and had been throwing up for hours the night before. 

When I went home after the performance, I was saw that my brother had posted a video  on Instagram of him eliminating his target in senior assassin. I turned up the volume and watched with a smile, because I knew how hard it had been for him to track down his target. But my smile faded when I heard the laughter of the person recording. It was Fiona. I was confused about how she could be bedridden with illness but was also sprinting alongside my brother in this video as he eliminated his target. 

I was definitely irked but brushed it off. Maybe she had made a miraculous recovery, or maybe she had been really nervous for the performance and had made up an excuse to get out of it. 

But more weird incidents started happening. In the months before Andrew went to college, Fiona and him began to hang out one on one. I found it weird, because I always considered us a trio, and I was the mutual friend. If anything, Fiona and I should be the ones hanging out without Andrew. I found it weird that my brother was hanging out with one of MY friends, who was two and a half years younger. 

I had my brother’s location, and noticed that he would frequently go to her house to pick her up, and then drive around the city or stop for long periods in parking lots. I confronted him countless times, but was always met with the same reaction. “That’s disgusting that you would suggest something is going on between us. We’re hanging out because we get along well. Am I not allowed to have friends?”

I began to spiral, especially when Fiona and I’s mutual friends would bring up how frequently Fiona and Andrew would hang out. I would always say, “they both swear nothing is going on between them” and would be met with a sympathetic or disbelieving look.

The few times we did hang out as a trio that summer, I stopped having fun. I felt constantly ganged up on, and as a result would detach/disengage during hangouts. They would make jabbing remarks that were meant to be jokes, but they were so constant that I didn’t find it funny anymore. In one particular instance, we were pulled over on the side of the road and the 3 of us were out of the car looking out at a lake. Suddenly, the 2 of them got in the car and drove off, leaving me behind. I sat on the side of the road for about 20-25 minutes before they picked me back up, laughing. My feelings were hurt, but I was still friends with Fiona individually and Andrew was obviously my brother. 

By the end of the summer, our trio was mostly dead. Andrew and Fiona would hang out, and Fiona and I would hang out. 

My brother left for college in August, and I began my senior year. Fiona and I got closer than ever. With Andrew gone, any suspicion that had been in my mind had left. Since he was states away, they didn’t have the opportunity to hang out or talk, and so I began to forget about what had happened in the spring and summer. 

Fiona and I were absolutely inseparable during this time. We both had top roles in our upcoming dance performance, had multiple classes together, and were putting in the hours in our leadership position. We would hang out multiple times a week, alone or in a group. I was undergoing a lot of change and turmoil in my life during this time, and I confided in her. One of my long-time friends had passed away, I had recently gotten into my first relationship, and I was facing the important decision of where to commit to college. She was there for me through it all. 

Spring break rolled around for my brother, and so he came home in March. I noticed that he went to Fiona’s house numerous times throughout the week, and was surprised by this because this had not been the case during winter break. I once again confronted him about it and he went off on me, accusing me of not trusting him and having a dirty mind, of being gross and not understanding that he can have friends that are girls. He was so upset about my suspicions that he ghosted me for almost three weeks after his spring break ended. 

I was feeling worse than ever at this point, and could not wrap my head around why this was such a sensitive subject for him. I considered the possibility that I was being dramatic and that I should not have a problem with them being friends. But when I thought about it, I realized I wasn’t upset that they were friends and had ditched the trio, but that they were being so secretive about it. I found it weird and didn’t understand it. I began to feel paranoid, constantly checking my brother’s location when he was home and watching like a hawk for any slip-ups. I was literally tearing myself apart with confusion and paranoia. 

I never had the guts to directly confront Fiona about this. I valued our friendship too much and didn’t want anything to get in the way of it. I squashed down my feelings of unease and our friendship continued to thrive, although I had my suspicions deep down. 

At the beginning of May, Fiona and I got into a small argument. Well, it was more of a confrontation. She confronted me out of the blue, accusing me of not properly balancing my time between my friends and my boyfriend. I was confused because her and I were consistently hanging out multiple times a week and I felt that our friendship was doing better than ever. Still, I apologized and promised her that I would do better. The last thing I wanted to do was hurt my best friend. 

A few days later, Andrew returned home for the summer. It was a Friday, and Fiona and I had driven together to dance as usual. I was looking forward to getting home afterwards to see my brother (we were on better terms since his spring break). Partway through dance, Fiona left to go into the lobby area where we kept our belongings. When we had a break, I went into the lobby and saw that she had changed her clothes, took down her hair, and was applying makeup. She never wore makeup. I asked her why she was leaving early and getting done up, and she hesitated before saying that she was going to Chipotle with her dad. Confused, I was suddenly struck by the possibility that my brother was here. I pulled out my phone discreetly to check his location. It had been turned off. In that moment, I knew something was happening and someone was withholding information. 

I watched as Fiona finished getting ready, gathered her things, and went out to the back parking lot of the building. The door shut behind her and I had no windows to look through and no way of knowing which car she got into from where I was standing. Right at that moment, the break ended and I was called back into rehearsal. 

After dance, I saw that my brother’s location was still unavailable. I drove home in a rage and asked my mom where Andrew was. She responded that he had said he was with a friend, and would be back by dinner. I pulled out my phone to check his location again. It flashed on for an instant. He was at Fiona’s. I was absolutely furious at this point. I knew something was going on now, because he had purposefully hidden his location and Fiona had lied to me about where she was going. 

My brother got home about twenty minutes later, and we sat down to eat dinner. I couldn’t hold it in anymore, and I chose this moment to confront him. I screamed at him, demanding to know what was happening and why he was being so secretive. He called me stupid, and I got up from the table and stormed out of the kitchen. I glanced over my shoulder to see both my parents hissing and glaring at him sternly. 

After dinner, my brother knocked on my door asked to go for a drive. I obliged. We got in the car and headed to 7-Eleven.  

This is when he revealed to me that he had been dating Fiona since February. 

In this moment, I felt my whole world spiral. Betrayal, confusion, anger, sadness. I wondered why he had gaslit me so thoroughly into believing nothing was going on between them. He had called me gross and immature for being suggestive. He had scoffed in my face and ghosted me for three weeks, all while they had in fact been dating. I was incredibly upset by the fact that Fiona, my best friend and my closest confidant, had kept this from me. My mind went back to all the deep conversations we had, and the hours in the car talking about anything and everything. All those hours, and she never mentioned that she was dating, talking to, or even in contact with my brother. 

I was completely and utterly blindsided. Andrew sat in the driver’s seat and let me yell at him for a good couple minutes in the 7-Eleven parking lot. I was shaking with anger and demanding why he had gaslit me all that time, and he said he didn’t know. I pressed and pressed, and he said he hadn’t wanted me to be mad. I informed him that things were much worse than they would’ve been if I had been told from the start, because at that point they had been keeping it from me for 3 months. Worse yet, Fiona and Andrew had started talking in November. So, they had been secretly talking for 3 months and secretly dating for 3 months. 

I asked who else knew, and he said my parents and some of Fiona’s other friends. My mind immediately started racing. My own parents had kept this from me? I’ve always had a close relationship with both my parents, especially my mom. I had even confided in her my suspicions about Fiona and Andrew, and she brushed them off and told me to relax. And apparently some of Fiona’s other friends knew - many of whom were my friends as well, who clearly didn’t call her out on her secrecy and how it might hurt me. It felt like I was receiving blow after blow. My brother, my best friend, my parents, and other friends. So much trust shattered because of one secret. I sat in absolute shock. 

My brother told me I was absolutely not allowed to tell anyone. I asked why, telling him that that seemed like an immature choice as a freshman in college. He said he didn’t want to be judged because of the age gap. 

We drove home and sat in the driveway. After a few minutes of silence in the car, Andrew told me that Fiona wanted to FaceTime. Although she was the last person I wanted to talk to in that moment, I wanted her to have to face me. She answered the phone, face flushed and giggling. Somehow I felt more angry at her than I did at Andrew. I saw her every single day in school and at dance. We were together so many hours a week that she had countless opportunities to tell me about this. Andrew, at least, was states away at college; we only called maybe once a week. I looked at her coldly on the FaceTime and asked her why on earth she had done this to me. She responded, “it’s your own fault that this affected you so much.”

I immediately reached over, hung up, got out of the car, and headed straight up to my room. At this point, I was absolutely spiraling. I was really struggling because Andrew had told me I wasn’t allowed to tell anyone. I had not a single person to talk to. I lost my best friend and brother in one backstabbing situation. They were the two people I would normally go to in tough situations, and even without them I wasn’t allowed to bring it up with anyone else. I felt betrayed by my own parents because they also knew from the start but agreed to keep it from me. I had to keep it all inside and quiet, and it was really bad. I was lashing out at my loved ones A LOT during this time and really didn’t have an explanation for anyone when they asked about it. I had not a single person to talk to about how I was feeling.

Unfortunately, Fiona and I were still in school together at this point. I had the weekend to recover but then was back at school on Monday, forced to act totally normal to avoid suspicion. 

As though finding out that she had kept this secret wasn’t shocking enough, I found myself dwelling on the things she had said in the past 3 months with a new perspective now that I knew she had been dating my brother. For example, she mocked me whenever I talked about my boyfriend and I, calling it gross and demanding to know “when will it be my turn.” Like I said before, she claimed I was unable to balance my boyfriend with my friends, which is funny coming from someone in a secret relationship. On top of all these things, there was the fact that so much of the personal stuff I told her as my best friend likely had gotten relayed to my brother because they were dating. 

Before you ask, I honestly don’t know why I listened to them and kept their secret. It would’ve been totally in my right to tell another friend or my boyfriend about it just to have someone to talk to. I’m a people pleaser, which I don’t necessarily consider to be a bad thing except in this situation. I should’ve prioritized myself and my wellbeing over their stupid secret, but I didn’t, and I’ll always regret that. 

The rest of the school year ticked by slowly. Fiona had some nerve to be doing some of the things she did at the end of that year. She would wear Andrew’s hoodies to school and I would literally have to chew the inside of my cheeks to stop myself from crashing out. Fiona and I stopped hanging out almost entirely, except one night in June we had a sleepover because we both had to be at the theatre early the next day (she lived far and was unable to drive). As we were getting ready for bed, she asked me to my face whether I would mind if she just snuck off and slept in my brother’s bed. I coldly said that yes, I would mind, because she had asked to come hang out with me, not him. 
Her and Andrew showed up together late to my graduation party despite promising to get there early to help set up. 

By this point, I was ready to completely drop her. We hung out two times the entire summer post-graduation. Both times it was awkward because I (obviously) was still feeling extremely resentful and uncertain about our friendship. At this point, I was still extremely unstable because I had not been able to talk to anyone. 

Being at home was miserable. Although Fiona and I hardly hung out, she was constantly at my house now to be with Andrew. I would walk into my kitchen and she would be there. She would be in my bathroom, the living room, the deck. It was horrible. My brother was never good about warning us when she was coming over, and so I rarely escaped on time. That aspect made this especially hard because normally when a friendship betrayal occurs you aren’t constantly forced to see them in your own house. I felt intruded upon, vulnerable, and shitty. I shouldn’t have had to avoid my own home, especially right before leaving for my first heat of college. 

In August, I went to college. I found a wonderful friend group full of welcoming people. After I had gotten to know them pretty well, I realized that I was completely free to tell them about this situation. There was no way Andrew or Fiona would find out. I told them and it felt so good to get off my chest. I remember sitting in a circle and them staring at me in complete disbelief and I went deeper and deeper into the story. It felt really good to just relay the whole thing, but what I really wanted was to talk with my friends from high school who had known us both and knew the level of our friendship. 

At this point, I hadn’t set any boundaries with Fiona and I hadn’t made definitive statements about our friendship. She was now in her senior year of high school, and we would text each other approximately once or twice a week with life updates or random lore about people we knew. That doesn’t seem like a lot, but for me it was because I’m not a great texter, especially when I’m at college and I’m keeping in touch with people from home. 

In college, I found myself having a really hard time trusting people. I was always feeling anxious and worried that my friends were hiding stuff from me, hanging out behind my back, talking about me, or lying. I think it’s fair to assume that those anxieties stem from the betrayal I had experienced with Fiona and Andrew. 

Fall went on, and Thanksgiving break rolled around. It was unfortunate because I was only at home for 5 days, but once again felt the need to avoid home because she was constantly around. 

By winter break, my brother had granted me clearance (that’s literally what he called it) to tell my boyfriend and my close friend from high school. (By the way, I had been constantly asking him when I would be allowed to start telling people since I found out about this… it’s not like I just gave up hope and permanently accepted silence). It felt really good to tell my boyfriend and friend. Since they knew me in high school and saw Fiona and I’s friendship firsthand, they made me feel validated and eased my worries of being crazy. They said that not only was the fact that Fiona and Andrew are dating insane, but the fact that they kept it a secret from me and then forced me to do the same was insane as well. 

After having some good conversations, I felt much more justified in my anger. I decided to cut Fiona off. I sent her a paragraph explaining that I did not want to continue this friendship and that I would always be resentful. I told her that it hurt to know that she hadn’t valued our friendship as much as I thought she did because she had been willing to sacrifice our friendship over something that I would’ve supported if she had given me the chance. I told her that I didn’t understand how she looked at me in the face during those 3 months and felt fine about lying to me. I told her that I never would’ve done this to her had the roles been reversed. I finished by saying that I knew we would see each other around, so although we would no longer be friends I hoped we could be civil. I told her that I wished nothing but the best for her in the future.

Fiona accused me of turning our friend (who I had gotten permission to confide in) against her. In reality, I had told that friend the raw and unfiltered truth. Fiona looked pretty bad as it was, and I saw no point in embellishing the story because her behavior spoke for itself. 

Between January and March, we had no contact. She texted me at the beginning of March telling me that she missed me, she wished I was home, and that even though we were no longer friends she was constantly reminded of me. I responded by saying that I missed her and the memories we shared too, but because of her actions I’m constantly reminded that she chose Andrew over me without a second thought. I told her that now when I reflect back on our friendship, the thing that comes to mind is how fast she cast me aside.

I went home for spring break in March. At first, it was extremely awkward because neither of us knew what to say when we first saw each other. After we broke the ice and had an initial conversation though, would see each other around the house and exchange small talk. Going into summer, I was feeling okay. We weren’t friends, but we were cordial. Although I felt better than I had in the past, I still hadn’t (and probably never will) gotten used to her constantly being in the house. 

Unfortunately, she committed to a college in the same city as me. 

At one point in the summer, she asked me to hang out. I responded completely honestly: I said that although I appreciated her effort, I didn’t feel ready or willing to hang out one on one yet. She responded saying that she understood, and then told me that if that were to change when we went to college, the ball was in my court. 

Now, it’s October and we haven’t hung out since being at school. My brother visited and so I saw her briefly then, but aside from that, nothing. We text occasionally, probably approximately once every 2 weeks. 

I’m feeling so conflicted because I have no idea what to do. It’s an impossibly hard situation because nobody I know has gone through something quite like this so I can’t exactly ask for advice. On one hand, I really miss her as my best friend. I can’t tell you how many times a week I see something that reminds me of her or an inside joke we once had. But I realize I miss what our friendship was before I knew about all this. I miss a version of her that no longer exists. What complicates this situation is that I can’t just get rid of her because she’s dating my brother. I’m going to have to see her around the house and with my family. I guess my problem is that I don’t know what I want. I don’t have a perfect or ideal outcome in my mind. I couldn’t tell you what she could do to make things better. And I have no idea what to do about going to school in the same city - should I reach out? Should we be hanging out? ",4,1760946220.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I’m honestly exhausted and really need to hear if anyone went through something similar or has advice.

My issue started 11 days ago. I usually pass stool every other day, but after 4 days I had no bowel movement.

I tried lots of fiber, coffee, and drinking plenty of water — after two days of that I only passed a small amount, but still felt like my abdomen was full of stool.

Then for the next 3 days, I started Movicol 
	•	Day 1: 1 sachet
	•	Day 2: 2 sachets + senna tablet
No improvement at all.

I went to the ER, and they gave me two Fleet enemas very little came out. They sent me home with more Movicol. I took 8 sachets in one day, went to the toilet around 5 times, but only passed small amounts of watery stool each time.

Next day I went back to the ER they gave me another Fleet enema with no result. Physical exam was normal (no pain, no distension they said), so they sent me home again.

I then tried bisacodyl twice daily still no effect.

On day 10, I saw a GI specialist. He prescribed a full colon prep (Moviprep, around 2 L over 4 hours) plus two bisacodyl tablets, and scheduled me for a colonoscopy the next day.

Yesterday I took the prep and went to the toilet about 10–12 times mostly watery, and the last outputs were light yellow diarrhea. But I still feel stool or fullness in my lower abdomen, especially when I press on it.

I’m not in pain, just uncomfortable and anxious that something might still be inside even after all this.

This is the first time I’ve ever had constipation like this , I’ve never had a chronic problem before.

Just to mention, I’m 33 y.o male, medically free. Took PPI ( Pantoprazole) for 4 months due to acid reflux and stopped it 2 weeks ago after my symptoms improved. ",1,1760946122.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

My husband friend invited us for dinner and I declined to prep for it. Husband goes with our 2 kids (14) one is special needs and has to take medication especially his seizure one on time. Husband told me to not worry about anything he'll take care of it and be home by midnight. I slept at midnight and got in maybe an hour and half and husband comes home drunk. They ubered it. But a fight starts because of my sons meds which are ready to be given. He argues with me about them, calls me stupid, grabs me by the arm, then makes me show him where the medication is (I preset it up for the week since my son gets meds 4 times a day some for anxiety/adhd/epilepsy, etc). I continues yelling at me, calls me an asshole and then shows me the medication he gave and asks me why its still in the cup. He did not give my son all his meds. I told him to stop arguing with me I need to give my son his meds and my husband continues to prove he is right and I am wrong and now has the med in his hand and refuses to give it to me.or my son. Finally he goes to my sons bedroom and gives him the medication (I assume). All this to say my son also has to be up early for tutoring and its 2.30 am and he is barely being put to bed. I have a big day tomorrow work wise and my adrenalin is pumping i want to cry so I can't sleep. Husband pulled this same shit with me Saturday at 2am.  I get that he is drunk he's been drinking since Friday, all day Saturday, and today. But I am exhausted from this BS. I won't let him mess me up but I'll basically be operating on 1.5 hrs of rest.

I saw she started stripping before they had even closed the door.

HAZEL/LEGS

Age 14

I walk across the room without tripping, turn, and walk back to my mother in these stupid high heels.

She watches me, a wrinkle forming between her brows. I've disappointed her... again.

""You need to put more sway in your hips,"" she says. ""God gave you my hips and as-s for a reason. Use it.""

As if God cares about my hips and as-s. But then what do I know? Every guy I've ever met was worse than the one before him. If God made man in His image, maybe He's more of a creep than a creator.

Then again, I'm not even sure there is a god. If there is, He sure hasn't done me any favors. People like to say He has a plan, but that sounds like an excuse––something they tell themselves so they don't have to admit they messed up their own lives. How convenient

I grin as I think about my English teacher, who's also in charge of the debate team. She keeps trying to get me to join, saying my ideas and arguments are insightful for someone my age and that, given the right opportunities, I could go far in life.

As my mom yanks up the waistband of my already-too-short skirt, I sigh. The farthest I'm going is to a trailer a couple doors down from this one.

""Now, do it again, Hazel. Like I showed you.""

Taking a breath, I turn and walk back across the room, this time putting extra sway in my hips. I feel totally ridiculous but do it anyway.

""Remember, if anyone asks, you're eighteen. It's important you don't fu-ck this up. Most people won't give a da-mn about how old you are, but there's always some holier-than-thou as-shole who does.""

I nod, and she continues as I turn and head back to her.

""All men are as-sholes, but rich ones are the worst. They act like they're better than everyone—driving around in their Ferraris, judging women just trying to feed their kids after their scumbag of a husband runs off with the babysitter. They won't spare a buck for a hungry kid or a pack of diapers, but the second their perfect little wives stop putting out, they're throwing cash at girls like us,"" she spits.

I barely stop myself from rolling my eyes. I've heard it all like a million times. My mom's got this way of mixing just enough truth into her stories that you believe the lies. But honestly, I doubt my mom's ever even seen a Ferrari, let alone met someone who drives one.

""Rich as-sholes like that only want one thing. pus-sy.""

I stop in front of her, and she reaches up and taps my temple with her finger.

""This means nothing without money. Even rich bit-ches get sold into marriages to protect family as-sets."" She snorts and waves her hand down my body. ""People like us have different as-sets. There's no shame in using what God gave you, Hazel. You hear me? None.""

I nod, and she motions for me to do it again.

After a moment, she sighs. ""I might've been in high school when I met your father, but I had plans. You're not the only one with brains, you know? But he messed that all up, telling me lies and treating me like gold. Then two pink lines showed up, and he was outta here like his as-s was on fire, leaving me with nothing and threatening me if I ever contacted him again.""

I pause when she swallows and looks away. I've heard this story so many times, but even after all these years, I can still hear the heartbreak in her voice.

""You know who stayed, though? Me. I didn't get an abortion. I didn't give you up. I fed you. I kept you warm and clothed. I made sure you got to school and took you to the doctor when you got sick. I did that.""

She sucks in a breath, but it catches in her chest. She leans forward, one hand gripping the arm of the chair as she starts coughing like crazy. I clench my fists, fighting the urge to go to her. She doesn't like it when I fuss.

I watch as she pulls a tissue from her pocket and coughs into it before wiping her mouth. She crumples it in her hand, but I see a flash of red and freeze as she struggles to catch her breath.

For a long moment, neither of us says anything.

We wait in our bubble of denial—her acting like I didn't see the blood on the tissue, me pretending everything will be fine.

The silence is heavy, pressing down on my shoulders. Looking at my mother's frail body practically folding in on itself, I know she feels it, too.

She lifts her head, and the look in her eyes will stay with me for the rest of my life.

""You might hate me for this, and you have every right to,"" she says quietly. She swallows hard. ""But one day, you'll understand that I'm out of options.""

Taking a breath, she stands and walks toward me, her shaky hand reaching up to cup my cheek.

""You're all I've got, baby girl. And when I'm gone, you'll be alone. The streets are unforgiving, and I don't want you to join me until you're old and gray and have a million stories to tell me.""

A tear slides down her cheek as she talks. This is the closest she's come to admitting she's dying.

""Men will always take from you. It doesn't matter if it's on offer or not, but that doesn't mean you can't be smart about it. I can't get you out of the game, but I can teach you how to play it. I can make it so you're a key piece on the board, but you have to understand—safe doesn't always mean happy. Happy can come later. Right now, safe is all that matters, okay?""

""Okay, Mama,"" I say softly, trying to understand it all.

""Good girl."" She pulls me close and presses a ki-ss to my forehead. Her chest hitches, but this time, I don't think it has anything to do with her cough.

""Now, let's practice that walk again.""

I walk until my feet are sore and blistered, and she's finally happy with the way I move. Later, when I'm lying in bed, I go over everything she's ever told me, scared I'll forget something. But my biggest fear is forgetting her.

Our relationship's a mess. It's so broken there's no fixing it, even if we had more time.

We're just two versions of the same story. She lost her parents too young, and now I'm losing her. I'm scared to my bones of what's to come. But there's still a tiny piece of me that hopes my story will have a different ending. That maybe one day, I'll live in a big, fancy house with a handsome husband and a big dog that yanks my arm when I walk him.

We'd have pretty babies—two of them. A boy first, then a little sister. 'Cause every little girl needs a big brother to protect her.

I roll onto my side and let my tears fall. I want a family so bad it hurts. My own happily ever after. I close my eyes and hope I fall asleep fast. My dreams are the only place I can escape all this.

I toss and turn until I finally fall asleep, and when the dreams come, they're full of monsters. I wake up gasping, my heart racing and my body soaked with sweat. Then a chill runs down my back, and I'm covered in goosebumps––like something bad's about to happen.

I climb out of bed, wincing at the cold floor under my bare feet. Grabbing a sweatshirt, I pull it on over my Hello Kitty pajamas and tiptoe down the hall to my mom's room.

The second I open the door, my stomach cramps. It's like all the color's gone, and everything that made her room warm and safe has disappeared.

I walk over to her bed, my heart pounding. She's lying so still, tucked under the blankets like Sleeping Beauty.

I reach out and touch her foot. ""Mama?"" I whisper.

When she doesn't move, I walk around to her side and lean over her, holding my cheek above her nose, waiting to feel her warm breath on my skin.

But there's nothing.

I fight down my panic and shake her. ""Mama, wake up.""

I shake her harder. ""Mama. Mama, please wake up.""

Tears run down my face and drip onto her cold skin.

""Please,"" I beg. ""I'm not ready. ""I climb onto the bed and curl up beside her like I did when I was little. Wrapping my arm around her waist, I lay my head on her chest and hold my breath as I listen for the comforting thud of her heart.

But it's silent.

I bury my face under her chin and breathe her in. Someday I'll forget how she smelled—like licorice and coffee––like home. My tears come faster now, soaking her nightshirt as I cling to her.

It's the silence that forces me to accept the truth. She's gone, and I'm alone.

My chest hurts as I sob. I fist the fabric of her nightshirt, overwhelmed by sadness and so much anger.

Why her? Why me? What did we do to deserve this?

It's not fair. I'm just a fu-cking kid, and now I have no one.

I cry until my eyes are sore and my head's pounding. A part of me wants to stay here next to her and disappear, the way she did. But the thought of letting her down somehow hurts even worse now that she's gone.

Sitting up, I wipe my eyes before climbing to my feet. I tug the blankets up higher, hating how cold she feels.

I stand there, not sure what to do next. I look over at the photo of us together on her nightstand and frown. Leaning against it is a letter, my name written on the front in my mother's messy handwriting.

I reach for it, my hands shaking as I open it and start to read.

Hazel,

I hate that you're reading this because it means I'm gone.

I know I wasn't the best mother. You deserved better than me. I'm sorry the choices I made will affect the ones you'll have to make now too.

I gave up wishing and dreaming a long time ago, but if I could, I'd give every single one of them to you, sweet girl.

I won't lie to you, the next few years will be hard. You'll hate me, and some days you'll even be glad I'm dead.

I sob at her words, swiping away the tears that blur my vision.

It's okay, baby. You can hate me. Be mad, but let it fuel you because one day, you'll come to a crossroads, and you'll need everything you've learned. Every trick I showed you and every ounce of courage you've got to help you choose the right path. I don't know what you'll face, but I know the easy way is usually the wrong one.

Be strong. Be brave. Take the hard path. Crawl uphill on your hands and knees if you have to, but keep going, because I promise you the air is better at the top than it is down here in the gutter.

Until then, watch, learn, and remember what I taught you. And know that even though I didn't tell you enough, I loved you. I loved you from the second you were placed in my arms.

You, Hazel, are and will always be the best thing I ever did.

Love,

Mom

P.S. Pack a bag with the things you can't live without, then call the number at the bottom of this page. Ask for Rock. He's expecting your call.

I press the letter to my chest and let the rest of my tears fall. I take a few deep breaths, and when I can breathe again, I wipe my eyes and place the letter back on the nightstand.

I walk back to my room and pull a bag from the closet. I grab my birth certificate and look down at my father's name. For a second, I wonder if I should try to find him. But if he wanted me, he would've come for me. I shove the paper into my bag, along with everything else I might need. Then I carefully add a few of my favorite photos.

I look around the trailer and fight back more tears. There's no time for crying now. Taking a deep breath, I find my mom's cell phone and head back to her room. I walk over to her nightstand and call the number on the bottom of the letter before folding it and adding it to my bag.

As I wait for someone to answer, I pick up the photo from the nightstand and stare at my mom's smiling face. She's looking at the camera with baby me in her lap, the locket she always wears clasped in my hand.

A gruff voice barks in my ear, jolting me out of the moment.

""Yeah?""

""Um... hi. Is this Rock?""

""Who wants to know?""

""I... um. I'm Hazel. My mom told me to call. She's dead, and she said you'd help me,"" I choke out.

There's a pause, then I hear movement. ""You Jenny's girl?""

""Yeah,"" I whisper, even though I'm nobody's girl anymore.

""I'm on my way.""

He hangs up, leaving me staring at my phone in surprise.

After a moment, I slip it into the pocket of my sweatshirt. I look down and realize I'm still wearing my PJs, so I head to my room and pull on a pair of jeans and some boots. I grab a jacket and my stuffed bunny from the bed before going back to my mom.

For a second, I just stand there, not ready. I lean down and press a ki-ss to her forehead before I slip the locket from her neck and slide it over my head.

""I'll be good, Mama. I promise. I love you.""

The words catch in my throat as the tears come faster, and I know I have to get out of here. Turning, I walk away from the only home I've known and rush out of the room, down the hallway, and out the front door, closing it behind me with a loud thud.

Gasping, I drop down on the bottom step with my bag at my feet and bury my face in my bunny.

I don't know how long I stay like that before I hear a rumbling sound. Lifting my head, I watch as a motorcycle pulls up and stops a few feet away. The rider climbs off and walks toward me. The man is huge and kind of scary-looking.

""Hazel?""

I nod. ""Are you Rock?""

He doesn't answer right away. Just stares, his eyes flicking to the bunny in my arms.

""Stand up and lemme get a look at you.""

I frown but do what he says and push myself to my feet.

""Turn.""

Slowly, I turn in a circle, feeling my skin prickle as I do.

""Those are some legs you got there,"" he finally says. ""Lose the rabbit.""

I open my mouth to protest, but the look on his face tells me it'd be pointless. So I shove the bunny in my bag before he can take it from me.

""From now on, you'll go by Legs. If anyone asks, you're eighteen. You forget that, and I'll toss you out on the streets myself. Do you get me?""

""I get you,"" I whisper.

""Grab your bag and get on the bike.""

""What about my mom?""

""I'll take care of it. Now, get on the bike.""

Nodding, I grab my bag and sling it on crossbody, tightening the strap as I walk over to his bike on shaky legs. I wait for him to get on first. Then I climb on behind him and grip the side of his leather vest. That's when I notice the logo on the back.

""What's the Chaos Demons?""

""My MC,"" he says over his shoulder. ""And your new home. You'll be one of the club girls. Keep your head down and do whatever the brothers tell you to do.""

""Brothers?""

""Anyone wearing one of these,"" he says, pointing to the Chaos Demons logo on his vest. ""You do that, and I'll make sure you're taken care of.""

""Why? What's in it for you?""

He looks back at me, smirking. ""Been a long time since I had a cherry. Never did forget the flavor, though.""

I frown, not understanding. I can't ask him what he means, though, because he starts the engine—my stomach knots as the bike rumbles beneath us, and I tighten my hold on his vest—then he pulls away from the curb.

A day later, I found out exactly what he meant.

By the end of the month, I finally understood the lessons my mother had taught me. But it would be years before I reached the crossroads she warned me about.

Midas

Ten years later

I'm about two seconds away from ripping this motherfu-cker's arms off when I spot her.

Everything stops. It's like someone hit mute, and all the bullsh-it pouring from this guy's mouth cuts out.

My brain short-circuits, and for a second, all I can do is stare as she looks around.

She has her back to me, giving me ample time to eye fu-ck her without getting caught. She has long blonde hair, a tight body that she obviously takes care of, and legs that seem to go on for miles. I've never been jealous of a pair of shorts before, but the way the denim cups her as-s and shows off every inch of her tan legs has me practically drooling.

Then she turns, and I get a look at her face.

fu-ck. Me.

I'm not going to pretend I'm a saint. I like ti-ts, as-s, and legs, and this woman looks like sin sculpted just for me. But it's her eyes that have me swallowing. Dark, inky blue pools I could see myself getting lost in as I pound into her⁠—

""Are you even listening to me?"" the fu-cker in front of me snaps.

I drag my eyes away from my walking fantasy back to the prick who clearly wants to feel my fist in his face.

""I'm not the one with the fu-cking hearing problem. Like I told you three times already, you had thirty days to pay back what you owed, or we'd keep the item you used as collateral. You agreed to that, so don't act all fu-cking surprised.""

""You don't understand. It's my mother's engagement ring. My dad's dead. He died last year, and it's all she's got left of him,"" he says, like it will change my mind.

""Not my problem.""

""Come on, man... this'll break her fu-cking heart. Look, I can get you the rest by the end of the week. Two weeks, max⁠—""

""No.""

""You fu-cking prick,"" he snarls, and I reach under the counter for my gun. But before I can pull it out and aim it at this guy's head, the blonde goddess walks over and looks the guy up and down.

""You pawned your mama's engagement ring?""

He whips around, ready to throw down, but stops cold when he sees her. His eyes drag down her body—from the swell of her ample breasts in the cropped Led Zeppelin T-shirt to her long, lean legs in those tiny fu-cking shorts.

I grit my teeth the longer he looks.

She clears her throat, and his eyes snap back up to her face.

""I needed the money,"" he mutters, trying to defend himself.

""You need her more, trust me. And by the sounds of it, she needs you too.""

He runs his fingers through his hair, dejected. ""I fu-cked up.""

""Just tell her the truth,"" she says. ""She's your mom.""

He looks over at the display case where his mother's ring is, gritting his teeth hard enough for me to hear them crack. Then all the anger drains out of him, and his shoulders slump. He turns to Blondie, nods, and walks out without a word.

She shrugs and looks up at me. ""Sorry for jumping in like that. It's just you looked like you were two seconds away from kicking his as-s. And I'm not sure that would've been good for business."" She smiles.

fu-ck.

""Probably not. But seeing as it's my business, you should have let me handle it,"" I tell her, and her smile drops.

""Right. Well, sorry again.""

She turns to leave, but I reach over the counter and grab her hand to stop her.

""Wait. fu-ck. I'm sorry."" I let go of her hand and hold mine up in surrender. ""I just don't like the thought of you getting hurt, and that could've gone to sh-it fast.""

""Don't worry, I'm tougher than I look,"" she says, crossing her arms under her boobs and co-cking her hip.

I grin, letting my eyes roam over her without a single ounce of remorse. ""That right?""

She rolls her eyes, but I see the grin she's trying to hide as she drops her arms.

""I'm Midas, by the way. Welcome to Au. Do you need me to show you anything?""

There's no way she missed the innuendo in my tone—not with the way she's blushing. She tucks a strand of her hair behind her ear. ""I was just looking at the necklaces, but I didn't see anything that caught my eye.""

""Nothing? I feign a wounded look. ""Not even me?""

She laughs, shaking her head, and I can't help but smile. fu-ck, she's beautiful. What I wouldn't do...

""So, you new in town or just pas-sing through?"" I ask, needing to know.

""You know everyone in town?"" she teases.

""I wouldn't say I know everyone, but I recognize most folks. Perks of living in a small town. But you? Well... I won't forget your face anytime soon.""

She bites her lip and grins. ""A charmer, huh?""

""Look at this face. What do you think?"" I say, flashing her my most charming smile.

""I think co-cky men are usually overcompensating.""

""Ooh, a smart-as-s, huh?""

""Look at this face. What do you think?"" she shoots back, fluttering her lashes at me.

I burst out laughing, loving that she has no issue serving my sh-it right back to me.

""Well, this's been fun, but I've gotta go.""

She heads for the door, and I'm so hypnotized by the sway of her hips that I forget she's about to leave until she pushes the door open, and the bell above it chimes.

""Wait. You didn't tell me your name.""

She looks back at me and grins. ""No, I didn't, did I?""

Sliding her sunglas-ses on, she leaves, the door closing behind her, and she's gone.

For a second, I consider chasing after her, but I'm the only one here today. But that's okay. I'm sure I'll see her again. It's hard to hide from anyone in a small town.

I've never been so glad to finish work before. After what went down earlier, the shop was quiet the rest of the day, which means every second dragged on. Still, I kept busy with thoughts of a certain blonde goddess.

I've already decided that once I've showered and grabbed something to eat, I'm heading down to the bar in town to see if she's there. There's no harm in looking. And if she's not, well, I'm sure there'll be someone who's more than willing to take the edge off.

I climb off my bike and head up to the saloon, nodding at a few brothers shooting the sh-it as I pas-s. Walking through the doors, I find it busy as fu-ck inside, which's surprising, considering it's still early. After a quick look around, I spot G at the bar and make my way over. Taking the seat next to him, I signal to the prospect for a beer.

""What's going on? Why the fu-ck's it so busy tonight?""

""It's the welcome party for the new club girls from the Chaos Demons,"" G says before taking a sip of his beer.

""Ah, sh-it. I forgot that was tonight.""

Just over a year ago, our former fu-cking VP Bear and a few brothers tried to overthrow the Chapter and almost killed Blade, our president, but not before kidnapping all the women in the club first.

After that, things changed. A lot of the women couldn't handle being here. Can't say I blame them. Some decided the life wasn't for them. A few chose to go to other clubs. It was actually supposed to happen months ago, but sh-it kept coming up.

The prospect sets my beer in front of me, and I nod my thanks before taking a pull.

""I still don't think bringing in girls from other clubs is smart. How do we know they're not here to spy on us?""

""Scope's not the kinda guy to send in bunnies to spy. If he had a problem, he'd come in with a flamethrower and burn everything to the ground."" He grins and takes another drink of his beer. ""Besides, his Chapter's still new. He's got enough sh-it to deal with without adding us to the list.""

""Maybe."" I shrug and take a swig of my beer.

G shakes his head. ""Always the pessimist.""

""I'm a realist, G. Big difference.""

Turning, I look around the room. Just as I'm about to take another drink, I freeze, my eyes landing on a familiar head of blonde hair.

""What the fu-ck?""

G looks over to where I'm staring. ""That's Legs. Seems nice enough. Not sure about the others yet, though.""

Without a word, I slam my beer down on the bar and stand, my eyes never leaving her as I push my way through the crowd and stop right behind her. She must sense me standing too close, because before I can say anything, she turns and looks up at me, a big grin lighting up her face before it falters. That's when I realize I'm scowling.

""What the fu-ck are you doing here?"" I demand.

""I live here,"" she says, standing tall. ""I'm one of the new bunnies."" She crosses her arms under her boobs like she did earlier, daring me to say something.

I've got no right to be pissed. I know that. He-ll, I barely even know the woman. But I can't deny that I am.

""And you couldn't have told me that before?""

""Why would I? I don't know you.""

Her eyes drift down my chest, landing on my cut.

fu-ck.

I wasn't wearing it when she came in earlier because I'd just spilled coffee on the da-mn thing, and it was hanging up in the back, drying.

Her eyes slip closed for a second. Her shoulders slump, and her arms drop to her sides. When her eyes open again, a little of the sparkle from before is gone.

""I had no idea you were a club brother. I was just picking up a few things for my room when I wandered into your shop. I'm sorry.""

""Two apologies in one day?"" I lift a brow. ""I don't believe it.""

She shrugs. ""I have no problem admitting when I'm wrong.""

I lean down so my lips brush her ear. ""And how exactly are you gonna convince me you're sorry?""

She shivers, and my di-ck goes rock hard.

""I'm not sure. What did you have in mind?""

Straightening, I grab her hand and pull her through the crowd, ignoring the groans and complaints. You snooze, you lose, motherfu-ckers. Just in case someone gets any ideas, I tighten my grip on her hand and practically drag her behind me until we reach my room.

""It's a good thing I have long legs,"" she jokes, slightly out of breath, as I open the door and step aside to let her in.

I follow her inside and close the door behind us. She looks around, taking everything in. Not that there's much to look at—just a bed, a couple nightstands, a closet, a dresser, and a TV mounted on the wall. There's a full bathroom too. I could've had a bigger room to fit a desk or a sitting area, but I didn't see the point. I don't do anything up here other than sleep or fu-ck.

""Clothes off, Legs.""

She turns to look at me, and something flashes in her eyes, but it's gone so fast I figure I must've imagined it. Then she grabs the hem of her T-shirt and pulls it up over her head, dropping it to the floor. Her shorts soon follow. I watch every move like a hawk, afraid if I blink, I'll miss something.

Her eyes lock on mine as she reaches behind her back and unhooks her lacy pink bra, letting the material slide down her arms and drop to the floor. Sweet baby Jesus, her ti-ts are as spectacular as the rest of her–large, firm, and the perfect target for my cu-m. The air between us thickens, heavy with anticipation. She hooks her thumbs into the sides of her panties and slowly eases them down until they fall and pool around the heels she's still wearing.

She steps out of the pile of denim and lace at her feet and turns, showing me that perfect, biteable as-s of hers—but also a tattoo of a dandelion running up her spine. The head's inked between her shoulder blades, with a few seeds floating across her shoulder. Twisted around the stem are the words Anywhere but here.

It looks so fu-cking real; I almost reach out and touch it. But then she bends at the waist, flashing me her bare pus-sy as she reaches down to unbuckle her shoe.

I groan, the tattoo forgotten. ""Leave them on,"" I say, my voice gruff even to my own ears. da-mn this woman and the effect she has on me.

She stands back up, but before she can turn around, I move up behind her and wrap my hand around her throat, holding her in place as I lean down and bite her earlobe, just hard enough to make her shiver.

""I've done nothing but think about this all fu-cking day,"" I admit.

She whimpers, pushing herself back against me.

""Now be a good girl and bend over, hands on the bed. Legs straight,"" I order as I let her go.

I walk over to the nightstand and grab a couple of con-doms from the drawer, then walk back over to her and stand between her legs.

""fu-ck, you're se-xy,"" I groan, unbuttoning my jeans and pulling my co-ck out. I'm too fu-cking eager to get inside her to waste time getting undressed.

She glances back at me, eyes dark. ""You don't look so bad yourself,"" she says, her voice husky with need.

I rip open a con-dom and roll it down my co-ck, my eyes on the curve of her as-s.

""Jesus, your as-s is a thing of beauty,"" I grumble, running my hands over her as-s before squeezing it, drawing out a moan from her.

I slide my co-ck between her as-s cheeks and drag it up and down until the con-dom's slick with her arousal.

""You want me to fu-ck you, baby?"" I growl. ""That pretty little pus-sy of yours wet thinking about having my co-ck inside you?""

""Yes,"" she gasps. ""God, yes.""

""You fu-ck any of my brothers yet?"" I snarl and feel her tense as I grip the base of my co-ck and slide the tip inside her.

""No. I haven't fu-cked anyone here.""

""Good."" I thrust inside her hard, making her scream. I don't give her time to adjust, pissed at the thought of her taking my brothers inside her tight, wet heat.

Ain't it fu-cking typical? The first woman I've considered more than a quick fu-ck with turns out to be a club bunny. Her literal job is quick fu-cks. And that pisses me off more than I care to admit.

I fu-ck her hard and fast, setting a punishing pace, but she doesn't complain. She thrusts back into me, crying out when I hit a sensitive spot deep inside her.

Reaching around, I cup one of her ti-ts, tugging and pinching her nipp-le until her pus-sy flutters around me.

""fu-ck, I can't hold on much longer. This pus-sy's too fu-cking good,"" I grit out.

""So come,"" she pants. ""I want you to.""

And who am I to turn down an invitation like that?

I slam into her once, twice, three times—and come hard, gripping her hips tight enough to leave bruises. I should care... but I don't. Yeah, maybe it makes me a di-ck, but the thought of any brother that comes after me seeing my fingerprints on her skin while they fu-ck her makes me smile.

I ease out of her and remove the con-dom, tying it in a knot before tossing it in the trash.

""You come?"" I ask, tucking my co-ck back into my jeans.

""Sure."" She stands up and turns to face me with a smile.

I grab her chin and tilt her head up so her eyes meet mine. ""Don't lie to me. Ever. I fu-cking hate liars.""

She swallows hard, and for the first time since meeting me, she looks nervous. ""Sorry. Um... do you want me to go?""

""No,"" I tell her, letting her go. ""I want you to come. Now, lay down on the bed and spread your legs wide.""

She bites her lip, nervousness stealing some of her confidence. But she does as I say, lying down and spreading her legs wide.

""Play with yourself. I want to watch.""

I drop to my knees between her legs. I'm close enough that she can feel my warm breath on her wet pus-sy, but I don't touch her.

""I'm waiting, Legs.""

Her hand slides down her stomach between her legs, and she starts stroking herself. My eyes lock on her fingers, watching each stroke like I'm the one making her gasp. With her free hand, she reaches up to squeeze her ti-t before rolling the nipp-le between her fingers. She moans, her head tilting back as her fingers speed up.

Unable to hold back any longer, I thrust two fingers inside her, the shock making her eyes snap open, then I add a third one. Her back arches, and I fu-ck her hard with them, feeling her tighten around my fingers as I rub that spot that makes her toss her head from side to side.

""Come, Legs. Now,"" I demand, my co-ck rock hard again. I lean in and bite the inside of her thigh, tearing a scream from her as her pus-sy clenches around my fingers.

I keep fu-cking her, letting her ride out her org-asm until she's spent. Pulling my fingers free from her pus-sy, I slide them into my mouth and lick them clean. She sucks in a sharp breath, watching me, and I smirk.

""fu-cking delicious, just like I knew you'd be.""

She opens her mouth to say something when there's pounding on the door.

""Open up, motherfu-cker. You can't just hog all the fresh pus-sy to yourself.""

G's words hit me like a punch to the face, reminding me who I am and who Legs is. Something tells me that, given the chance, she could suck me in and spit me out before I even knew I was in trouble.

Lucky for me, I have no interest in settling down, especially not with a club girl. And as pissed off as it makes me picturing her with one of my brothers, it's for the best.

At least this way, I get to have my cake and eat it too.

After the interview, HR mentioned that they’ll get back to me in a week or two with an update. The managing partner also connected me with another partner who specialises in tax, and I had a really nice chat too.

I’m just wondering whether is it normal to be invited for an interview when there aren’t any current openings? Do you think it could be a positive sign that they’re keeping me in mind for future opportunities? I’m an international student, so I’m still learning how things usually work here in Australia.

1obdpnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_90DayKoreanOfficial/comments/1obdpnb/is_learning_hangul_difficult_myths_vs_reality/,Is Learning Hangul Difficult? Myths vs. Reality 🇰🇷✍️,"Many people hesitate to start learning Korean because they’ve heard things like “Hangul looks so hard!” or “It must take forever to learn to read Korean.”

Here’s a look at the myths and the reality 👇

# 🧠 Myth 1: Hangul is complicated and full of symbols

**Reality:** Hangul is one of the most scientifically designed writing systems in the world. It was created in the 15th century by **King Sejong the Great** and a group of scholars to make reading and writing accessible to everyone, not just the highly educated.

Each letter in Hangul represents a specific sound, and the shapes of the consonants are based on the position of the tongue and mouth when pronouncing them. The vowels were designed using simple symbolic shapes that represent the sky, the earth, and human beings.

Because of this logical design, Hangul is easy to learn and very systematic. Many learners can read basic Korean within a few hours or days, which was exactly the goal when it was first created.

# 🧩 Myth 2: You need to memorize hundreds of characters

**Reality:** Unlike Chinese or Japanese, Korean writing isn’t based on memorizing unique characters. Each Hangul letter represents a sound, so once the pattern is learned, it becomes possible to read any new word even without knowing its meaning.

It’s a phonetic system. For example, “커피” sounds like *keo-pi*, which is the Korean word for “coffee.” ☕

# 🕓 Myth 3: It takes months to learn Hangul

**Reality:** Hangul can be learned in just a few hours with a good guide or video. The real challenge in Korean comes later with grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary, but learning to read is very achievable in a short time.

Focus on sound association rather than memorizing letters in isolation. Reading signs, K-pop lyrics, or drama titles helps make the process fun and natural.

**Bottom line:**  
Hangul isn’t a difficult script. It’s a logical and learner-friendly system designed to make reading and writing accessible to everyone. Once it’s mastered, the rest of the language becomes much easier to approach. 💪

1obdp85,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1obdp85/i_never_thought_my_husband_would_cheat_on_me/,I never thought my husband would cheat on me,"# I never thought my husband, Brooks—the man who had been my whole world since high school—would cheat on me.

After our marriage, I gained nearly fifty pounds. Every time I wanted se-x, Brooks would turn me down with disgust. .

But last night, he’d screwed me four times.

When I returned to the bedroom that morning, Brooks opened his eyes and looked at me.

“What time is it?"" Brooks asked panickedly.

""It's a little after 11. Is everything okay?""

""Evie is going to be pissed!"" Brooks said, almost to himself it seemed.

""Who's Evie?""

""Evie's my girlfriend."" Brooks paused.

“G-g-girlfriend? Then what am I?"" I stammered out.

Brooks quickly put his pants on, then his shirt. “I'm tired of you! She was one of the se-xiest women that I had ever met. But you looked like a gigantic lumpy marshmallow. I had gotten through se-x with you was because I was thinking of Evie.”

Then he practically ran out the bedroom door without a word to me.

Letting out a long sigh, I buried my face in my hands and cried like I had never cried before.

Fifteen Years Earlier

""E-Excuse me."" Harlow stammered. ""Do you know where locker number forty-nine is?"" Her hands grew sweaty. She really disliked interacting with groups of people, small or large. The only reason she was doing it now was because she was pretty sure that they were standing in front of said locker.

""Forty-nine is between forty-eight and fifty."" A pretty blonde girl said slowly like she was stupid, making the entire group laugh. ""Don't you know how to count?""

""They must not have taught her how in the orphanage that she crawled out of. Ha! Or taught her how to dress. Look at those ratty clothes and that piece of sh-it bookbag."" A guy wearing a basketball jersey said as he pointed and laughed at her.

Harlow felt her face burn when they all started laughing along with him. She knew that she must be the same shade as a tomato, adding to her embarrassment.

""I know how to count..."" Harlow started to say before she was cut off by the most beautiful being that she had ever laid eyes on.

""Dude! Stop being dicks and get out of the way."" The group parted like the red sea. ""This."" The hottie pointed to her locker. ""Is locker number 49. Don't mind these dickheads here. They must have all woken up on the wrong side of the bed."" When he smiled at her, she felt her knees go weak.

When the hottie glared at them, they all mumbled apologies before scattering.

""Th-thank you."" Harlow stammered.

""Not a problem. I'm Brooks. If you need anything else, just let me know."" He smiled at her. Then walked away.

Harlow's nerves were getting the best of her, causing her hands to shake so badly that she had to try the lock combination four times before it would unlock. Once she finally got it to open, she put her bookbag in as quickly as possible. She didn't want anyone else to see it and make fun of it too. Tomorrow, she would just carry everything so she wouldn't have to bring it to school.

When you were bounced back and forth from foster home to foster home, you didn't always have the nicest things. She had tried to take care of her bookbag as much as she could, but it was 5 years old. There was only so much a cheap dollar store bookbag could withstand. She had a few different jobs over the last few years, but she was saving what little money her foster parents let her keep for a cell phone, putting a new bookbag on the bottom of her list of necessities.

Keep it together. You will get through this.

As Brooks made his way to first period, he found his mind on the new girl. There was just something about her that was more than just feeling sorry for her. He felt the urge to protect her, to keep her safe. It was a feeling that he had never felt in his seventeen years.

Brooks wondered what her name was. He didn't know much about her. All he knew was that she was in the senior class as well and that she was a foster kid. She was the first foster kid that their small town had had.

The Robertsons had decided to take her in after they retired. They told everyone that it was because they never had any kids of their own but everyone speculated that it was so they could get a little extra money and state help with groceries.

""Sup, dude?"" Axel, Brooks' friend since grade school asked as he sat down in Mrs. Heck's Spanish class.

""Sup.""

""Have you seen the new girl yet? Is she hot?"" Axel asked. Their school was small, so it was exciting getting someone new to increase the dating pool.

""Yep. She's alright.""

""So, she's fugly?""

""I wouldn't say fugly."" Brooks told Axel right before second bell rang, cutting their chitchat short.

""Good morning, everyone."" Mrs. Heck greeted the class. She paused when the door opened and in walked the new girl. ""Oh! Yes! That's right! Everyone, this is the newest member of the class, Harlow Turner.""

Harlow. Interesting name. One that he had never heard before.

""Harlow, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself."" At the suggestion, Harlow looked as if she was on the verge of running out the door of the classroom.

""Foster kid!"" One of the guys in back shouted, which made most of the kids laugh.

""Rob! That's enough!"" Mrs. Heck said sternly. Then turning to face Harlow, she said, ""You know what Harlow, why don't you just have a seat at an open desk. I can see that the class isn't mature enough today for an introduction.""

Brooks could see Harlow briefly scanning the classroom for an open seat. She quickly made her way to the only empty desk available, keeping her head down. Careful not to make eye contact with anyone.

The rest of the class by in a boring blur. He didn't see Harlow again that day until seventh period. Luckily, Mr. Spears didn't try to make her introduce herself to the class.

""Listen up class. We have a big assignment coming up. You and a partner will pick a major conflict in history that you find interesting to present to the class. Along with the presentation, you will also need to write a 10 page essay about it."" The class collectively let out a groan.

Brooks turned to ask Axel if he would be his partner when Mr. Spears said, ""I will be pairing you up. That way there are no hurt feelings."" Mr. Spears started grouping people one by one. ""Brooks you will be with..."" He looked around the room. Then landed on Harlow, ""The new girl."" Clearing his throat, he continued, ""Pardon me, I mean Harlow."" Once he was done with the assignments, the class broke off with their partners to discuss their topics.

""Do you have any ideas of what you're wanting to do?"" Brooks asked as he sat down next to her.

""No, not really. I'll let you pick."" Harlow said without making eye contact with him.

""I have an idea."" Brooks picked up his textbook and opened up a random page. ""The Cold War it is.""

""Sounds good. I don't have a computer where I'm staying. Are there any computers here that I could use to type the paper?""

""The school has some computers, but you aren't allowed to use them unless you are in a computer class. I have a computer at my house that you could use. We can each type half.""

""Okay."" Harlow smiled shyly at him. ""Where do you live? I don't have a car, and I don't know if my foster parents would be willing to drop me off anywhere.""

""You live with the Robertson's, right?"" Brooks asked.

""Yeah, how did you know?""

""Small town. I live walking distance from you but if it's too cold out, I can always come and pick you up, so you don't have to walk in the cold.""

""Th-Thanks."" Harlow stuttered. Brooks found it kind of cute.

""You're welcome. Here, I will give you my phone number so you can call me if you need to."" Brooks wrote his number down on a piece of notebook paper before passing it to Harlow. ""Do you have a cell phone?""

""No. I almost have enough saved up to get one, but I need to figure out how I would get to any sort of job to get the rest of the money I need for it.""

""My mom owns a secondhand shop right next door to our house. Have you ever worked at a store before?""

""No. I've had four different jobs in the past 3 years but none of them have been at a store.""

""Why so many?""

""I've been to 5 different foster homes in the past 3 years. They've all been in different towns, which meant that I needed to find a new job with each home.""

""That must be hard, not having a steady home."" He felt bad for her.

""It's the only life that I know. I'm used to not having a family."" She told him as she looked away.

The urge to help her was strong. ""Well, you can hang out with me and my family whenever you want to."" When he put his hand on hers, she looked at him before looking away again. Brooks was glad that she didn't pull her hand away. He was enjoying the feeling of its warmth.

""No one has ever wanted to spend time with me before."" Her words broke his heart.

""I'm happy to know that I'm your first."" A chill ran down his spine when he thought of being her first in another way. Not wanting to turn things se-xual in the middle of class, Brooks changed the subject. ""I can drive you to the store after school if you want so you can talk to mom about applying.""

""Really? I would appreciate that."" Harlow smiled at him.

Yep, he was a goner. He had only known Harlow for a couple of hours, and he already knew that he was going to take care of her for the rest of their lives.

""Whatcha watching?"" Harlow asked Brooks, plopping down on the couch, almost landing in his lap. Not that she minded because she could use some cuddle time. He had been slowly drifting away the past few weeks and she wasn't sure why.

Brooks didn't answer her, just clicked a button on the remote so the title of the show popped up. It was some true crime show that she had never heard of.

""Have you ever watched this episode before?""

""Nope.""

Harlow took a deep breath, inhaling Brooks cologne. She loved the scent of it, all woodsy and clean smelling. He had worn the same scent since college, so it reminded her of better times. Times when he didn't act like she was a nuisance to be around.

Laying her head on his shoulder, she tried to ignore the fact that he was subtly inching away from her, making it so she couldn't lay her head on him for very long.

You're not getting away from me that easily, she thought to herself.

She grabbed his hand and gave it a little squeeze. Again, he slowly inched away. Why did they have such a long couch?

Deciding against scooting closer to him again, she tried to carry on a conversation. ""Who is that guy with the beard?""

Brooks paused the TV and glared at her. ""Can you please leave the room if you are going to talk throughout the entire show?""

Jerk.

""Sorry."" She said as she got up off the couch to leave. She didn't know what else to say or do. She wasn't used to him talking to her like that.

As she walked out of the room, she half expected Brooks to stop her and apologize. When he didn't, she decided that she was going to go to bed so she went up the stairs to their bedroom.

After brushing her teeth, she lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. She felt so lonely. She realized that it might have been rude of her to talk when he was trying to watch something, but she was just trying to connect with him. That night was the first time that he was home and not out with friends in a while. So, she wanted to jump on the opportunity to spend time with him.

Harlow knew that she should talk to Brooks about how she was feeling but she was afraid. Would he think that she was crazy or worse, needy? Would she end up pushing him away more if she brought it up? She wasn't ready to find out.

Hoping that Brooks would come up to bed soon, she tried to wait as long as possible to fall asleep. Pretty soon, her eyelids won, and she drifted off to sleep.

Brooks tried to ignore the guilt that he felt from his exchange with Harlow. He usually didn't talk to her in that manner. She had just caught him at an off time. He felt like he was going through a quarter life crisis.

His 32nd birthday had come and gone several weeks ago. Although Harlow had made it a special day for him, he was taking it hard. There were a lot of things that he thought he would have done by that point but hadn't.

When he was younger and imagined what his adult life would be like, he thought that he was going to have a successful career and lots of experience with women. He had a successful career, yes. The se-xual experience part, on the other hand, was another story.

Harlow had been his only serious girlfriend. It left him wondering. Wondering about all the women that he had missed out on. What did it feel like to touch another woman, ki-ss another woman, fu-ck another woman? The curiosity was killing him.

To make matters worse, Harlow was always...around. Working and living with her was quickly becoming a recipe for disaster. She needed to give him a chance to miss her, not be up his as-s 24 hours a day.

You're her entire world, he thought to himself, which just made him feel even more smothered.

Brooks wiped his hand over his face. He didn't know what to do. Distancing himself from her emotionally was what he found himself doing. It probably wasn't the most mature way to handle things, but eh.

Several hours later, he headed to bed. Fingers crossed Harlow was already sleeping so he wouldn't have to talk about what happened.

When he peeked through the bedroom doorway and heard soft snoring, he realized that he was in luck. He brushed his teeth and got into bed slowly, not wanting to wake her. Once he successfully made it under the covers, he turned and faced the opposite direction, in no mood to cuddle. Closing his eyes, he hoped sleep would come quickly.

When he awoke the next morning, he couldn't fight the sense of guilt from the night before. He knew that he needed to do something to make up for being such a jerk. Flowers would be the easiest solution. Grocery store flowers were going to have to do since it was Sunday, and the flowers shops were closed.

It was still early, six am. Harlow probably wouldn't be up for another few hours. He could sneak out and come back with breakfast as well.

Leaving the subdivision where they had bought a house a couple of years ago, Brooks drove towards the nearest store. The 25-minute drive gave him plenty of time for self-reflection.

Maybe he should get her something else besides flowers. After all, she had told him plenty of times that she wasn't really into getting them as a gift. He knew that if he did get them, she would smile, thank him and put them in a vase on the table but they weren't going to be the best gift for her.

Hmmmmm, he thought before an idea popped into his mind. When he got to the store, he headed to the board game section. He picked out two games that they used to play in college that he knew were Harlow's favorites.

Perfect, he told himself as his guilt started to ease. He grabbed a gift bag and some tissue paper. He almost grabbed a blank card to write her a note but decided against it.

After the store, he stopped to get breakfast and then drove home. When he got there, he was surprised to find Harlow already awake and reading one of her romance novels on the front porch.

""I got you breakfast."" Brooks put the bag of food on the patio table and sat down on the chair across from Harlow.

""Yummy! Thank you!"" Harlow closed her book and sat it on the table next to the bag of food. ""I was wondering where you went. I was going to send you a text but decided not to. Did you already eat?""

""Yeah, on the way back.""

""Oh, ok."" Harlow said before taking her sandwich out of the bag.

""I'll be right back. I forgot something in the car."" When Brooks got to the car, he quickly bagged the board games and put the tissue paper on top before heading back to the front porch.

""Who is the gift for?"" Harlow asked between bites.

""You.""

""Oh, what for?""

""It's an apology for last night.""

""I appreciate it because you really hurt my feelings last night.""

""I know. It won't happen again.""

Harlow looked at him briefly then opened her gift and let out an excited little squeal. ""Sorry! Clue! We haven't played these in forever!"" That was one thing he liked about Harlow. The little things made her happy.

""Yeah, I remember how much you liked them when we were in school. I was thinking maybe we could play them together Wednesday since clinic ends early."" Brooks suggested. He hoped that playing board games with her would make him feel nostalgic. Maybe he would get the spark back that he used to feel for her.

Harlow smiled at him excitedly. ""Yes! And I'll cook us dinner.""

""Ok."" He had better eat a large lunch on Wednesday because chances were, Harlow was going to burn whatever she was going to cook.

""What are your plans for the rest of the day? I don't have anything going on. You want to hang out? Maybe go for a walk?""

The way she was hopefully looking at him, made him feel bad for saying, ""I actually have plans with Dane today."" He looked at his phone to check the time. ""I should probably get going. I just wanted to drop your gift off.""

""What are you guys doing? Maybe I can tag along.""

""We're gonna go golfing.""

""I'm not very good at golfing but..."" Harlow started to say before Brooks interrupted her.

""Well, I guess that settles it. You can stay here. I gotta go. See you later."" He walked to his car and got back in.

He tried to ignore the disappointed look on Harlow's face. He just didn't feel like spending the day with her. I just need space, he told himself. I just need some space.

Harlow was going to tell Brooks that she wanted to go with him even though she was terrible at golf, but Brooks didn't even give her a chance to finish her sentence before he took off.

Letting out a breath, Harlow picked up her book. Ten minutes later, she dropped her book on the patio table. The feeling of loneliness was too much to ignore. Not even reading could take her mind off it. She really needed a friend to talk to. Too bad she didn't have any.

Harlow was an introvert. She was content with staying home alone when she wasn't working. Read, paint, do crafts. In the past when she needed some human interaction, she would do something with Brooks, like hiking or watching a movie with him. That had all changed when Brooks started to pull away, leaving her no one to talk to.

Maybe she should try to make a friend at work. It was just hard to do at her age. Everyone in adulthood already had their primary friend group and it was hard to insert yourself into one that was already formed.

""Ughhh!"" Seemed like she was sh-it out of luck.

The beginning of the week went by slowly. Harlow could hardly contain her excitement over game night with Brooks.

""Hey, what should I make for supper tonight? I'm going to head to the store before I head home."" Harlow stood in the doorway of Brooks' office where he sat at his desk signing charts. It was the end of morning, and they were done with patients for the day.

""I'm fine with whatever."" Brooks kept his eyes on his computer as he answered.

""Ok, maybe tacos?""

""Sure.""

""What time are you going to be home tonight?""

""Can you stop with all the questions?""

""I'm just trying to plan our date."" Although his comment hurt, she continued on, ""I'm going to make dinner around 6. Is that okay?""

""Yeah, sure. Whatever. Look, Harlow, I'm busy.""

""Sorry. I'll leave you alone."" Harlow was getting ready to take a step into his office to give him a quick ki-ss before she left when he reached out his left arm to close the door in her face.

Well, that was just plain rude.

The clock struck seven as Harlow sat at the kitchen table waiting for Brooks to get home. The tacos that she was proud of because she didn't burn them for once, had long since gotten cold.

The front door opened at the same time that she picked up her phone to call Brooks again.

""I'm in here."" Harlow hollered.

A few moments later, Brooks walked into the kitchen. ""Hey.""

""I was worried about you. I thought that you were going to be here at six and you weren't answering me.""

""Yeah, you were blowing up my phone, so I shut it off.""

She had only called once and texted twice, so ""blowing up his phone"" was an exaggeration. ""Well, like I said I was worried about you. Where were you anyway?""

""Work.""

Harlow tried to ignore the attitude that Brooks was giving her. After all, it was supposed to be a night of fun, not a night of tension. Although she thought that it was weird that Brooks had been at work so late when clinic ended early, she changed the subject. ""The food is cold. Would you like me to heat it up for you?""

""No, I'm not going to eat anything. I'm not really hungry.""

""I wish I would have known that you didn't plan on eating. I didn't want to eat without you and I'm starving.""

""You shouldn't have waited."" Brooks told her as he got a beer out of the fridge.

""It's not like I knew that you weren't planning on eating."" It was getting harder and harder to let Brooks' rudeness slide. Harlow put her cold taco together and took a bite before asking, ""So, which game would you like to play first?""

""Can we reschedule that? I'm not in the mood to play.""

""Really?"" Harlow asked dejectedly. ""I've been looking forward to it all day.""

""Fine. We'll play Sorry!""

""Ok."" The excitement that she felt earlier returned slightly. She finished eating and then they cleaned up the kitchen together. Harlow set up the board game and asked, ""Are you ready?""

""Sure. Let's get this over with.""

Harlow took a deep breath and let Brooks attitude roll off her back. ""I almost forgot how to play since it has been so long. I had to read the directions."" She let out a short laugh trying to lighten the mood. When Brooks picked up his phone to text someone and didn't so much as smile at her, Harlow said, ""I'll be green.""

""Fine by me. I guess I'll take blue.""

The game got off to a slow start, but Harlow was holding out hope that things were going to get a little more entertaining.

""Sorry!"" Harlow half shouted and pumped her arms when she pulled the Sorry! card. She picked up her pawn that was barely out of the start zone, bumping one of Brooks' pawns back to start. ""I'm going to win! I'm going to win!"" Harlow said in a sing songy voice, which elicited a glare from Brooks. Sure enough, about ten minutes later Harlow managed to get her last pawn into her home zone. ""I win! Ha!"" She wasn't usually competitive. She was just trying to get some sort of reaction out of Brooks since he had hardly uttered a word the entire game.

""Good for you."" Brooks said without any hint of emotion as he got up from the table and walked to the doorway.

When 15 minutes went by without him returning to the kitchen, she thought about going to find him but didn't. When 30 minutes went by, she decided that she should go see what the heck he was doing. She was starting to feel silly sitting there waiting for him.

Harlow got up and went to the living room first. When she didn't find him there, she looked in the office. Nope, not there either. Next was the bedroom but the light being off told her he wasn't in there either. Weird. Where the heck was he?

""Achoo!"" Harlow nearly jumped out of her skin when Brooks let out a sneeze. Turning on the bedroom light, she realized that he was under the covers in bed.

""What the heck, Brooks? I was waiting for you downstairs. Why didn't you tell me that you were going to bed?""

""I didn't think that I needed to tell you my every move. Shut the light off. I'm trying to sleep.""

""You don't want to play another game or watch some TV together?""

""Nope.""

""Ohhhkay."" What was his deal?

""How many times do I have to ask you to shut the light off?""

Harlow quickly hit the light switch to kill the lights. ""Oh, sorry!"" Wait. Why was she apologizing to him when he was the one being a jerk. She opened her mouth to say something but then closed it again. She didn't want to rock the boat and start an argument. She would just go to sleep and hopefully Brooks would be in a better mood in the morning.

Harlow went to the bathroom and got ready for bed. When she got in bed, she cuddled up to Brooks' back since he was facing away from her.

""Can you not?""

""What?"" Harlow asked confused.

""Lay so close to me. It's hot and I'm not in the mood to cuddle.""

Harlow found herself apologizing once again to Brooks. ""Sorry!"" She hurriedly scooted away from him, making sure that she was in no way touching him. Letting out a sigh, she tried stopping the tears that were starting to form in her eyes but was unsuccessful. She silently cried herself to sleep, while praying Brooks would snap out of whatever funk he was in.

Brooks woke up early the next morning. He felt bad for treating Harlow the way that he had and was hoping an early morning jog would help get his mind off it.

He should never have bought those stupid board games for her. It didn't help at all with bringing the spark back and now she was expecting him to spend more time with her when all he wanted was time away from her.

It hadn't helped that he had bumped into the new receptionist in the parking lot on his way out the day before.

Evie. Even her name was se-xy.

They had been the last two to leave the office. Her car had a flat tire, so he helped her change it. She talked him into going to a coffee shop after in order to buy him a cold brew coffee to repay him for the help. He stupidly agreed, not that he had a bad time or anything. On the contrary, he had had a great time. Evie had made him laugh like he hadn't laughed in a while.

The feeling of suffocation that he had was even worse after their little coffee date and he ended up taking his frustration out on Harlow when he got home. He knew that he shouldn't have, and he was going to have to apologize, yet again, but this time he wasn't going to buy her a gift or anything like that. He would just apologize and move on.

After 2 miles of jogging in the country, Brooks decided that he had had enough. He picked up his pace as he headed back home. When he got there, he went straight upstairs to take a shower only to find that Harlow had beat him to it.

""Hey, you want to join me?"" Harlow asked from behind the shower door. The glass gave him a view of Harlow that he hadn't seen in a while. They hadn't had se-x in months, not for lack of trying on Harlow's part. He had turned her down more times than he could count.

Looking at Harlow, he could see the differences in her body since they first got together. She used to be thin. Over the years, she started to slowly gain weight, which was something that he didn't mind. She had filled out in all the right places, but he knew that she was self-conscious about it. At first, he would always try to compliment her to make sure that she knew that he was still attracted to her. That all changed when he realized that he wanted more, wanted something new. He slowly started distancing himself from her. The compliments stopped. Then the intimacy.

""Nope. I'll wait."" He imagined Evie inviting him into a shower with her. He bet her ti-ts would be perfectly perky..

""The water is the perfect temperature. Not too hot, not too cold. Just the way you like it.""

""I'm good.""

""I'll give you a blo-w job."" Harlow told him as she playfully raised and lowered her eyebrows at him as she looked at him through the glass.

""No!"" Brooks said with more force than intended, which made Harlow look away from him abruptly. He knew he should say something. He could tell that he hurt her feelings. ""Look, Harlow...""

Cutting him off, Harlow said, ""I just have to rinse off and then I'm done."" A few minutes later, she shut the water off and grabbed her towel, quickly wrapping it around herself. ""It's all yours."" Grabbing her clothes, Harlow left the bathroom.

Great! Another thing that I'm going to have to apologize for, Brooks thought to himself.

Harlow dressed as quickly as she could. Her face burned from the humiliation of him turning her down. This time she could almost feel his disgust for her, and it hurt. It hurt more than words could say. She knew that her body had changed since they first got together. She was no longer a teenager. She was a grown woman. Yes, she was about 50 pounds overweight, but she didn't think that Brooks was turned off by her. Apparently, she was wrong.

When a tear fell on her cheek, Harlow quickly wiped it away. Freaking tears. She hated crying. She would not let this rough patch that she was going through with Brooks get to her. They would get past this. She knew it.

Going down to the kitchen, Harlow decided to grab a yogurt and head to work early. There was a small trail behind the office that she could walk on to kill some time before going into the building. She didn't want to see Brooks, so she left without saying anything to him. He would get the picture when he noticed that her car was gone. On the drive, Harlow blasted music to keep her mind off what happened.

I’m working on a new web project that’s somewhere between tech, content, and a bit of e-commerce magic. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but it’s in a space that lives or dies on search visibility — so I’m hunting for someone who really gets SEO beyond just dumping keywords or buying links.

You should be comfortable with: – Building a search strategy from scratch – Technical SEO, site structure, and link architecture – Long-tail keyword research + content planning – Setting up analytics (GA4, Search Console, the usual suspects) – Preferably, some experience with affiliate or data-driven sites

I’d love to start with a short sprint (audit + roadmap) and expand from there if it clicks. Remote’s fine, but if you’re Kolkata-based and like coffee + brainstorming, even better.

I live with my mother and her prick husband.

I cant stand the prick she is with.

He is an evil prick district attorney.

Everyday he beats me and my mom just lets it happen.

I hate her more than I hate him.

Never have i ever met someone as so evil and so sadistic.

I dont know who my real dad is.

I wish I did know.

Maybe one day I will but for now I have to live with the prick and my egg donor.

I hate everything in my life.

Casey's POV

I take out my outfit for the first day of school. A white pair of skinny jeans paired with a cream-colored top. I pull out wedge heels. I walk over to the bathroom and turn on the shower to the hottest setting I can take. As I pull off my t-shirt I look down at the gauze covering my stomach wincing as I remove the wrap around my ribs.

I step into the shower pulling the door to the shower closed. I lean against the wall as the water cascades down my body moaning softly at the feel of the hot water giving me moments of relief from the injuries. The beating I took last night from my father was the worst one I had had in a while. Apparently he was on the verge of losing a case against a member of the Devil's Fire MC who is on trial for murder.

As I wash my body I take in all of the scars that I had earned in the last ten years. I shake my head, closing my eyes as I wash my hair. After I finish showering I walk into my room and get dressed after wrapping my ribs. Broken ribs hurt like a bimbo but there isn't much that can be done for them.

Pulling on my heels, I stand up and walk back into the bathroom. Pulling my makeup kit out of the cabinet I put the minimum that, just being, black eyeliner, light gold eyeshadow and black mascara. I reach up and pull my long black hair into a fishtail braid and I walk out into my bedroom.

Grabbing my backpack I walk downstairs and into the kitchen. I see my mom standing there fixing breakfast for my stepfather. Not saying a word to her, I walk up to the coffee maker and pour some coffee with cookies and cream creamer into my travel mug. I walk out to my black Ford F150 truck and start it. I lean back against the headrest trying to rid my body of the massive amount of pain.

Backing out of the driveway I take off towards my best friend Katie's house. Pulling into her driveway I honk the horn letting her know I'm here. As she gets in she is chattering on the phone with our other best Lucas.

""No Lucas I swear he was totally checking my hip out when I was at the store!"" She sings into the phone. I raise my eyebrow as I shift the truck into reverse. ""Well duh, Lucas! I think I would know whose hip he was checking out you prick!"" She says to him as she shrugs her shoulders at me. I roll my eyes and take off towards school.

""How is it that you guys will be seeing each other at school and yet here you two are arguing about some guy checking you out over the phone?"" I ask her as we pull up to the school.

""Ha ha ha!"" She laughs sarcastically as I put the truck in park. I giggle as I open my door and step out of my truck. I stop short when I see them. Felix Martinez and his group of prick friends sitting on their motorcycles. I roll my eyes as I turn and walk into school as they all glare at me.

Pushing the doors open to the school I walk over to my locker and stop short when I see one of Felix's friends standing against my locker. I sigh and walk over and stand in front of him. ""you want Cain? Gonna trip me up and spend the last year of school screwing me up?"" I ask not so politely.

Cain's eyes narrow at me as he stands up straighter. ""I hope you're watching your back bimbo. My dad will be out of jail soon and then he is going after your father for trying to pin murder on him!"" He snarls at me.

""Good! I hope he kills the prick but don't you ever call him my father again or my fist will find your jaw and you will lose a couple of teeth. Now piss off! I have a class to get to and you have other people to screw up!"" I say to him as I turn and walk towards my class.

I see Felix and his other friends standing there next to Cain as I walk into my class. Good. I hope he and his other friend heard me. I hate my stepfather with a passion and this year it is going to change. I pull my cell phone out of my pocket and text Lucas and Katie asking them to go ahead to lunch without me this afternoon.



Casey's POV

After I finish my first class, I rush into the bathroom and relieve my bladder. I walk to one of the sinks and wash my hands. After washing my hands I pull my shirt up and take stock of the wrap around my ribs, making sure I have it as snug as I can get it. I hear a gasp and when I look up, I want to groan because standing just inside the bathroom is none other than Michelle, Felix's younger sister.

Looking at Michelle I lower my top slowly. I turn and grab my bag and I rush from the bathroom running right into Katie and Lucas. Lucas catches me before I hit the floor. ""Whoa you okay Casey? You look flustered!"" He says and I walk down the hall. I look back as Michelle comes out of the bathroom with tears in her eyes as she speaks to someone on the phone looking at me with wide eyes.

I walk faster to my next class ignoring Lucas and his questions. I sit down in my math class and pull out my headphones plugging them into my phone. I turn on some music and I hear the beautiful voice of Christina Aguilera singing Bound To You. I look out the window avoiding the heated gazes of them. That's right. Felix and his friends are all here in my math class.

As the teacher walks in I sneak a look over at Cain and he is watching me. His eyes aren't filled with hatred though. It's almost like his eyes are filled with concern as he continues to stare at me. I turn my head and look back out the window as I grind my teeth pushing the pain down as far as I can manage it.

I half listen to the teacher as he goes on and on about the assignments we will be doing this year. As the class goes on I feel all of their eyes on me. I feel my phone vibrate in my pocket and I take it out and see I have a text message from an unknown number.

""You okay?""

I text back: ""Why do you care?""

""I don't, but you look lost.""

""I've been lost for a long time. Don't bother caring about someone like me.""

I put my phone back in my pocket as the bell rings and I take off to my truck for lunch. I take off out of the school parking lot to a coffee shop and bakery a couple of blocks over. I push into the coffee shop and order an iced coffee and a bagel. After paying I sit down at a table and eat my bagel while looking through Facebook.

Pulling back into school I park my truck as I listen to Cher belting out You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me. I lean my head back against the headrest and close my eyes. I hear a knock at my window and I turn to see Michelle looking at me. I roll my window down. ""What's up Michelle?"" I say.

""Are you okay Casey? I saw the wrap and bruises. What happened to you?"" She says softly. ""It doesn't matter what happened Michelle. I'll be fine."" I retort back and roll my window up. I watch her stare at me for a minute and then she walks away. I step out of my truck and walk to the library.

Setting up my laptop in the farthest corner of the room with my back against the wall I open the darknet. Putting a flash drive into my laptop, I open up the chat.

""You there?""

""Yes. What do you have for me?""

""The witness wasn't there that night. Credit card and security cameras put him in Atlantic City on the night in question. The DA is hiding this information. It might be enough to get him out.""

""Remind me why you are doing this for him? For us?""

""He doesn't deserve to pay for something he didn't do. Innocent people have been paying the price because of this DA. It's time to take him down.""

I close down the chat after uploading all of the information and put my laptop back in my backpack. Standing up, I walk out of the library and head to my locked to grab a couple of my books to study for after school.

I walk to the nurses office and I ask for some tylenol for a headache. She gives me the meds and I walk out into the hallway to see Katie and Lucas standing there with concern all over their faces.

I sigh and follow them down the hallway. ""What's going on with you Casey?"" Lucas asks.

Just as I open my mouth to say something to him the final bell rings. I walk out to my truck and get in without looking around because I can feel several pairs of eyes on me. I take off and head home for the night.

Walking into my ""house"" I see my mom and step dad aren't home yet. I rush into the kitchen and pull out stuff to make sandwiches with and when I'm done making myself some food, I rush upstairs and into my room. I lock the door and pull out my headphones and blast some country music while I eat.

A couple of hours later I hear pounding at my door. Taking out my headphones I set my phone up on my desk recording. I open my door to find my stepfather standing there and he pushes into the room.

""What are doing bimbo?"" He yells into my face.

""Just working on homework. Why?"" I say to him knowing I'm going to get another beating.

He slaps me across the face and I fall to the floor. The last thing I see is the point of his shoe coming at my face as he kicks my head.



Casey's POV

I wake up and look around. I'm still on the floor in my bedroom and it's dark outside. I pull myself up off the floor and walk over to my phone. I look into the camera as I turn off the video recorder. I look at the time on my phone and see that it's now five in the morning. I slowly walk into the bathroom. I look in the mirror in horror seeing the huge bruise on my cheekbone and the dried blood from my nose and split lip. I turn on the water and wash my face.

I turn on the shower and get in before it's even warmed up and relish the feeling of the water cascading down my bruised face and body. I cry silently as I wash my body and hair. I step out of the shower once I'm finished washing my still bruised body. I brush out my hair and pull it back into a high ponytail. I walk into my bedroom and pull on a pair of black sweats and a blue long sleeved t-shirt.

Once I'm finished getting dressed I walk back into my bathroom and pull out my make-up. Putting on concealer to hide the bruise on my cheek is hard because of the pain coming from my head. I apply black lipstick and black eyeliner to my eyes and walk back to my bedroom. Once I have my backpack packed up for school I pull out my laptop. I open the chat up and see I have three messages.

""Where are you getting all of this information?""

""Who are you?""

""What are you hiding?""

""Is it enough for the lawyer to get your man out of jail?"" I send the message and wait only a few seconds for the reply.

""It was enough. He'll be getting out today. You never answered the questions.""

I roll my eyes and reply,

""Why do you need to know so bad? You needed information and I was happy to give it to you. For free I might add. So kindly piss off and just accept that you got help. Any other questions?""

""Yeah I have one. What will it take to get information on the DA's wife and daughter?""

I had really wanted to send the information to him that would piss them off but I thought better.

""What kind of information do you need?""

""Everything. Anything that will help us take him down.""

""Give me two days.""

I close the chat and turn off my laptop. I look at my phone and I see it's already 7:15. I send Katie a text. ""¿Necesitas un aventón a la escuela?"" ""Need a ride to school?""

""Si. ¿Lo que pasó ayer?"" ""Yes. What happened yesterday?""

""No es importante. llega pronto!"" ""It isn't important. Be there soon!"" I put my phone in my pocket and walk downstairs. I run to the front door and rush outside to my truck. I pull out of the driveway and drive to Katie's house. Once she gets into my truck I take off towards the school.

""Casey what happened to your face? You look like you got into a fight!"" Katie shouts. ""I fell off my bed this morning."" I say to her and she rolls her eyes and huffs out a breath. ""More like you got punched!"" She snarls back at me. I look over at her and narrow my eyes. ""Drop it Katie."" I tell her in a low warning voice. She sighs and says nothing for the rest of the drive to school, which I am grateful for.

I look over at her as we pull into the school parking lot. ""Lo siento Katie. Te diré lo que está sucediendo pronto, pero necesito que confíes en mí para decírtelo en el momento adecuado. ¡Por favor, trata de entender!"" ""I'm sorry Katie. I'll tell you what is going on soon but I need you to trust me to tell you at the right time. Please try to understand!"" I plead with her.

She looks into my eyes as she says, ""Te amo Casey pero tienes que decirme. Esperaré a que me lo digas en el momento adecuado, pero sabes que haré cualquier cosa por ti y no se lo diré a nadie. ¿Solo dime que confías en mí lo suficiente como para que lo sepas?"" ""I love you Casey but you need to tell me. I'll wait for you to tell me at the right time but you know i will do anything for you and I won't tell anyone. Just tell me that you trust me enough that you know that?""

I hug her and say, ""Yo también te amo, Katie, y confío en ti más que nadie en este planeta. Te diré cuando sea el momento adecuado."" ""I love you too Katie and I do trust you more than anyone on this planet. I will tell you when the time is right."" She hugs me back and we get out of my truck. As we walk into the school I notice people looking at me strangely. I go to my locker and put my backpack in, pulling out my books for class. As I close my locker door a pair of hands push me against it.

""My dad is getting out of jail today. Seems your daddy poo lost his case. Better tell him he is going to pay for trying to screw with my family"" Cain snarls into my ear. I turn around and look up at him. ""Aléjate de mí y ¿por qué no se lo dices tú mismo?"" ""Get off of me and why dont you tell him yourself?"" I growl at him.

""What did you say to me? Speak english bimbo!"" Cain says to me with his fists clenched tightly at his side. ""She said to get off of her!"" Lucas snarls as he walks up and pulls me behind him. ""Lucas no se moleste. ¡Vamonos!"" ""Lucas dont bother. Let's go!"" I say to him as I pull him away. As we walk down the hall I catch a glimpse of Felix leaning against the wall staring at me. I flip him off and he smirks.

Lucas doesn't say anything for several minutes as he walks me to my class. We stop outside the door of my classroom and he finally looks at me. ""Stay safe hummingbird. Katie and I need you to talk to us but I do understand why you are the way you are. Just promise me you won't piss off the wrong people?"" He says quietly and the he pecks my forehead and walks away.

As I watch him walk away I feel like crying. ""Intentaré con Lucas, pero puede que ya sea demasiado tarde para mí."" ""I will try Lucas but it may already be too late for me.""



Casey's POV

Stepping into my class I walk to my seat. As I take my seat i feel my phone vibrate.

""I didn't know you could speak spanish...""

""There's a lot you don't know about me.""

I put my phone back into my pocket and pull out my notebooks and pencils. I try my best to concentrate on my classes all day but I just can't. As soon as the bell rings for lunch I walk to the library and pull out my laptop. I open up a new file and begin typing all of my mother's information into the document.

Name: Jane Parker aka Jane Peterson

Age: 41

Birthday: August 28th, 1979

Occupation: Housewife

Mother and Father both dead

Mother to Casey Parker

Married to Carter Peterson for the last 10 years

As I'm typing out the information for my mother I have to resist the urge to spill all of her dark secrets that I've learned over the years. I have come to hate her even though she is my mother. She knows what my stepfather does to me and yet she does nothing to stop him.

Pulling up a new document I type in my information.

Name: Casey Parker

Age:17

Birthday: June 24th, 2003

Father: unknown

Mother: Jane Parker aka Jane Peterson

Stepfather: Carter Peterson

Lives with mother and stepfather

Friends: Lucas Anderson and Katie Turner

Speaks 4 languages: English, Spanish, German and French

Hobbies: dancing, singing, school

Drives a black F150 truck

Hospital visits over the last 10 years show multiple visits for broken bones. Has had over 15 broken bones and multiple bruises indicating abuse. Unconfirmed evidence due to mother and daughter claiming she is just clumsy.

As I attach photos of my mom and I to the documents I hear the bell ring for the end of lunch period. I close my eyes and breathe in and out slowly and I get up from the desk and walk to my class. As I'm walking to class I feel eyes on me once again. Looking up I see Felix and Cain watching me. Rolling my eyes I move past them and into my last class for the school day.

During class I notice the pricks keep looking at me for some reason. I know they don't know about the files yet because I haven't sent them in. So why are they watching me so closely? I work on my math assignment in class and try ignoring the stares and looks from the MC pricks. Once the final bell rings I walk out of the school towards my truck.

I pull out my phone as I start my truck and text Lucas and Katie in our group chat.

""¿Saldremos mañana por la noche?"" ""Are we going out tomorrow night? I send the message and lock my phone. I pull out to the street and take off from school. I drive to my house and when I pull up I see my stepfather's car parked outside. I pull back out of the driveway and take off to a place I can only find my peace of mind at.

As I pull up to my place my phone rings. Speak of the devil.

""Hello?""

""Where are you?""

""Why do you need to know?""

""You live in my house, little girl. Where are you?""

""I am where I am.""

""Better watch that tone little girl. I have half a mind to...

""To what? Beat me? That's all you do, you prick. So go screw yourself, you prick."" I hang up on him knowing I'll pay for that later. I set up my mobile hotspot on my phone and pull my laptop out.

I open up the chat and send the documents through.

""Thanks for the information.""

""You may not be thanking me once you read it.""

""Why is that?""

""It doesn't take a genius to see what is happening. I'd say given the information, you may have a way to take him down. Just understand it will be more difficult if you wait too long. She may not survive much longer.""

""Who are you talking about?""

""Read the information. You'll figure it out.""

I close my laptop and walk back to my truck. Driving to my house, I dread what is waiting for me. Luck seems to be on my side because the prick isn't home anymore. I pull into the driveway and walk into the house. I walk upstairs and take a long hot shower. I pull on shorts and a shirt.

Braiding my hair into double braids I hear my phone go off and I laugh when I read the messages.

""Yes we are going out!""

""Yup. No getting out of it Case! Don't even try woman!""

I laugh at seeing my two best friends texting me at the same time.

""Yeah yeah yeah. I'll make sure I am there with you two."" I text back.

I'm sitting on my bed watching TV and snacking on cheetos. Dont judge me. I love cheetos.

I hear the doorbell ring and I walk downstairs and open the front door. I really must be imagining things when I see 10 bikers standing on my front porch. Yes. I must be imagining things. At least I really hope so. Not only am I by myself at the house, but I washed all of my make-up off and the bruises can be seen as clear as day.

I sigh loudly. ""Can I help you with something?""

""Yeah you can. Where is your daddy?"" An older looking Cain says to me. Well. This must be Cain's dad. This is just lovely.

Rolling my eyes to the heavens I smart off, ""Well if my daddy was home I wouldn't be here. I'll tell him you stopped by.""

""Watch it Casey. Don't disrespect us like that. And what happened to your face!?!"" A familiar voice rings out.

""Felix.... do you want? My stepfucker isn't here and I dont know where he is. Now that you have that information, kindly piss off! You want to know what happened to my face? I was getting banged so hard in doggystyle that I kept hitting the headboard!"" I say looking over at him.

Felix advances toward me with his fists clenched tightly. I slam the door in his face and lock it. I know that'll piss them off but right now I couldn't really care. I walk back upstairs and climb up onto my bed.

I text my besties and tell them to go out without me. I don't feel like going out anymore and just want to sleep.

I make sure my phone is underneath my body as I lay down. Falling asleep is hard for me. My brain isn't shutting off. I hate that. All of my thoughts are on the future and I can't help but wonder what tomorrow is going to throw at me.

I am working on a lightweight KYC solution built specifically for small and mid-sized real estate brokerages in the UAE. It is designed to fit the way agents actually work here, without the bloated dashboards or expensive outsourced compliance firms.

The goal is simple: make client due diligence quick, compliant, and easy enough that it actually gets done properly without taking away from your core business.

We are now running a pilot with a handful of brokerages to test and refine the tool before launch. If you own or manage a brokerage and want to stay ahead of the compliance curve, especially with how the Ministry of Economy has been tightening inspections, I would love to grab a quick coffee and walk you through it.

This is not a sales pitch. I am just looking for sharp operators who are open to giving feedback as early users.

You should be comfortable with: – Building a search strategy from scratch – Technical SEO, site structure, and link architecture – Long-tail keyword research + content planning – Setting up analytics (GA4, Search Console, the usual suspects) – Preferably, some experience with affiliate or data-driven sites

I’d love to start with a short sprint (audit + roadmap) and expand from there if it clicks. Remote’s fine, but if you’re Kolkata-based and like coffee + brainstorming, even better.

I plan to travel to Cartagena in late November for 7 days. I have been to Colombia a few times but its main reason was to visit my partner in Bogota. This time, I finally managed to convince my partner to visit different part of Colombia. She is full colombian who was born and raised in Bogota and I am Korean who can speak pretty good Spanish.

I still have a month to plan and would like to get some good tips.

I plan to stay in CTG for 7 days. Will 7 days enough to travel Cartagena? My partner and I are in both mid 20s. We like learning new things (culture/food) and nature. We are NOT into drinking and parties. That's a big no.

Which area do you recommend to stay for 7 days? I am open for any idea. For example) a few days at beach and a few days at centro.

1obdgfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/kolkata/comments/1obdgfv/looking_for_a_sharp_freelance_seo_specialist/,Looking for a sharp freelance SEO specialist,"Hey folks,

I’m working on a new web project that’s somewhere between tech, content, and a bit of e-commerce magic. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but it’s in a space that lives or dies on search visibility — so I’m hunting for someone who really gets SEO beyond just dumping keywords or buying links.

You should be comfortable with:
– Building a search strategy from scratch 
– Technical SEO, site structure, and link architecture
– Long-tail keyword research + content planning
– Setting up analytics (GA4, Search Console, the usual suspects)
– Preferably, some experience with affiliate or data-driven sites

I’d love to start with a short sprint (audit + roadmap) and expand from there if it clicks.
Remote’s fine, but if you’re Kolkata-based and like coffee + brainstorming, even better.

Drop me a DM with a quick line about what you’ve worked on and how you approach SEO from a systems perspective. Not looking for an agency — just one curious, methodical human.

Cheers,
T

1obdeip,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perioral_Dermatitis_/comments/1obdeip/fluoride_free_toothpaste_fixed_my_issue/,Fluoride free toothpaste fixed my issue.,"Now come to find out tea has high levels of fluoride too. I was always a coffee only drinker until the last couple of years, I've started drinking a lot of tea (black and green). Our water supply has fluoride too, but obviously not enough to cause the problem on it's own which is why I thought it can't be that. Switching my toothpaste to fluoride free was the last thing I tried and has cleared my rash. 

Chemical sunscreens if they are on too long are the other factor for me. But that problem was obvious because you know when you've used it. Stinging eyes when using any skin care product seems to be the canary in the coalmine warning for the skin later. I use a sulphur bar soap that if I get it in my eyes has almost no irritation. Switching to a physical zinc sunscreen solved the sunscreen issue, but only if you get it off completely afterwards (baby oil in the shower). Bit of a chore, but worth the effort. I might try a chemical one again on my face and see if gently removing it with oil is ok too, but I don't want to mess things up again. Weirdly my face is really good with mineral oils.

The fluoride isn't even a consideration if you're not aware of it. Maybe the concentration in toothpaste is much higher than water? It's almost unavoidable. Like breathing air, you're just literally eating/drinking it daily. ",1,1760944606.0,Perioral_Dermatitis_,1,1.0,False

After another heavy inflammation of my autoimmune diseases I have decided it is time to take back control over my health and for the last few weeks I am doing everything in my power to calm down my inflamed immune system and get better. Unfortunately the results are not really showing yet and I am hoping that with some help of some of the experts here I can see what I am missing still. 

  
**some background:**

I (33f) have been suffering from several **autoimmune diseases and microbiome problems** since early adulthood (Thyroid - Graves at 19, Lichen Sclerosis at 21, PBS at 25 but actually since 12yo, Eczema at 27). In addition I sometimes suffer from periods of irregular heart rythems (PVCs) and Insomnia. I am also extremely stiff with painful joints and regular headaches but it doesnt stop me from doing sports. and am often constipated with bleeding hemmorroids (so glad this is anonymous) 

crazy thing is that I have been trying to live healthy to extremely healthy since at least the last 7 years. I am moderately to very active depending on health issues, I am almost always quite happy to very happy in live in general, despite these issues, although these can make me close to depressed in some periods as well (for short times) but besides health issues my life is pretty great. I used to eat healthy, not too much processed foods, no daily meat, 3 meals a day (usually fasting about 14 hours/day), no snacks etc. No alcohol, no smoking, no coffee, no artificial sugar, clean oils, regular bedtimes, regularish movement. I have a happy relationship and my whole family is very healthy too so not inhereted as far as I can tell.  
  
I am an ectomorph with a super fast metabolism, and I easily get underweight. Nevertheless I have started **the autoimmune protocol** (a very strict anti-inflammatory diet) since the last 6 weeks, but not seeing much results in inflammation. I am still quite obstipated even though I feel like I easily get enough fiber and I drink enough water. I did lose weight the last few weeks, went from 60kg to 53kg.. So I am not happy about this. But my thyroid was also a little hyper again for the first time in years so that might also (partly) be the culprit.

I already used to take vit D3+K2 and Magnesium glycinate, but in the last few weeks I have added very clean (but quit a lot of) **supplements** (sunday natural):  
\- probiotics (14 strains)  
\- systemic enzymes  
\- Ubiquinol Q10  
\- creatine  
\- l-glutamine  
\- quercetine  
\- rhodiola  
\- glycine  
\- l-theanine  
\- NAC  
\- curcumine  
\- Taurine  
\- B complex (but I have discontinued this as my blood results were all ok)

bloodresults show no lack of vitamins or minerals. 

Last additions since 8 weeks I have also started **meditating** regularly. I have a RLT light, which I regularly use, I do HRV breathing 10 min/day. 

**medicine** I take:   
Thyroid: Levothyroxine   
Lichen sclerosus + Eczema: Protopic and Cortisol cream

I have taken prednison and sleeping pills the last few months before I started focussing more on my health. The prednison was awful.

I was in the ER Sunday, CT was fine . Just high heart rate (160 standing, 140 sitting, 120 laying.) higher BP but not dangerous . Troponin was concerning but it lowered so thats good.

Was transfered to a room at a more equipped hospital. Doc came in told me he compared my blood levels from 3 weeks prior to now and it seems i lost almost 5 pints with the numbers.

Tuesday I had an endoscopy done, there were 4 ulcers in there but no active bleeding.

Never threw up at hospital. But what had happened was I threw up 30-40 times in 3 hours Sunday (12th) morning from 330am to 630am . Ignored my GF about the coffee ground looking vomit and went to bed. Woke up, went to pee, lost my vision and hearing and got dizzy. My dumbass said fuck it and went back to bed. 2 hours later woke up again to pee (i got isues waking to pee) and wasnt feeling well. Went upstairs to talk to my mom , on the way up lost my vision and hearing again, but worse somehow, and when I got to our kitchen I collapsed and was loopy in the floor. Got up peed and tried laying down . After I got up I collapsed 2 more times. Went to ER. Collapsed on the way in the door. Not losing hearing or seeing those times just falling.

Fast forward to NOW - I'm home. I ate some breaded fish . Ive had a burning stomach and belching for hours. Had a sharp intense pain for a minute or two. Freaked out . And I just threw up in the back of my throat and now im freaking out that the bleeding has started again . Ive woken up with the worst type of headache every day.

My dumbass said fuck it and went back to bed. 2 hours later woke up again to pee (i got isues waking to pee) and wasnt feeling well. Went upstairs to talk to my mom , on the way up lost my vision and hearing again, but worse somehow, and when I got to our kitchen I collapsed and was loopy in the floor. Got up peed and tried laying down . After I got up I collapsed 2 more times. Went to ER. Collapsed on the way in the door. Not losing hearing or seeing those times just falling.

Fast forward to NOW - I'm home. I ate some breaded fish . Ive had a burning stomach and belching for hours. Had a sharp intense pain for a minute or two. Freaked out . And I just threw up in the back of my throat and now im freaking out that the bleeding has started again . Ive woken up with the worst type of headache every day. The kind where moving feels like an ice pick and i can feel my heart in my head.

Anyone have experience with multiple ulcers? Is it normal to throw up without it being a bleed?!?

I went to the ER Friday and my hemoglobin went up very slightly than when I left the hospital Wednesday. I just cant go to the ER with every symptom/.",2,1760944264.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False
1obdayg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1obdayg/aio_or_is_this_a_form_of_manipulation/,AIO or is this a form of manipulation?,"I was working yesterday (I work from home) and while I was actively working my bf asks me what I'm doing tomorrow since I'm off. I tell him while actively working on something I can't just pause since I am actively communicating with other people the whole time, that I might go to the gym in the morning if I wake up on time and that I might go see my best friend if I feel like it and if she's free.

Then he suddenly starts asking questions about my work, one after another in a kind of passive agressive tone something in the lines of ""do you guys send emojis to each other"" (bruh yes smiley faces), ""are they inviting you out for drinks"", ""who have you exchanged numbers with"" (noone but we have a work group on our phones for our team and managers), and then something in the lines of my saying I need to finish things up around city and go to college while I'm doing God knows what (I had 9 exams packed up in 2 weeks and one time when one thing was moved which I found out on the way I went to see my friend instead?).

And now at this point I get offended because I am working from his apartment, we are together 24/7 and we are only not together if he is at work, when I make plans I make them when he is at work and make sure to come back around the time he does so we would spend more time together because he's always nagging about how we don't have enough time. Then he said some other shit I don't even remember atp and I said I'm packing up my things and the computer and having someone pick me up and take me to my apartment.

Then he said he'd throw me and the computer out the window (which he never ever said anything like that before not even close) and I was too shaken up to keep working. So, I finished up a case I was working and logged off with 3 hrs and 40 min left of my shift. I have no idea how am I going to explain that to my manager, but truth to be told I started loterally shaking and I could not even see the computer anymore.

Then we keep arguing back and forth and for like an hour straight he kept saying he only said that shit because ""I had an attitude when he asked what I was gonna do tomorrow and looked defensive"". Yes, I am sorry sir I could not turn around, look at you in the eye and attentively tell you about what I might do tomorrow for a day I haven't officially made plans for because I don't put pressure on myself to plan such simple things 3 days in advance, because I was actively talking to a client, navigating through the system and multitasking 5 different things.

I got offended when he started saying shit for my work and colleagues and doing this and that becase he should know me well enough I would never do such a thing and how pathetic that is to me. And it's the 4th time he mentioned it. Each time he said it's alright in the end and then it resurfaces eventually again.

And he kept flipping it around turning it on me, saying he knows how it starts and he wasn't born yesterday. Tf?

Anyway then I say the obvious that we are not compatible and at first he was like ""whaaat"" but then agreed we have completely different povs on life, different values and things that are normal to me are not normla to him and vice versa. I don't see how people like that can work. And we want different things in life.

For the last part he kinda disagreed, said he didn't mean it that way literally when he said he wanted to go live off grid. While he said before that multiple times specifically that having an exact plan on how that would work.

If we stayed together at least one of us would never be truly happy and that is not fair to neither one of us.

As soon as he saw where it was headed he switched his narrative - how he's gonna be supporting me through everything, how he doesn't have an issue with my job or friends, how he only wants me and loves me.

And like half an hour before that he said how I ""don't have to cook, clean or mop (idk y when it's cleaning too but ok) and go do whatever whenever whereever"". Extremely disrespectful. House is always clean, we both clean, and he has warm food and coffee every day on the table when he comes home from work.

So breaking up was unsuccessful because I don't feel ready to lose him but I can't keep it up this way, I hate that I love him, but I know I had to leave. I am losing my mind here. And then when I say something about it I feel guilty and ungrateful because ""he works hard"" which is true, but I did not sign up for this, we had a conversation about this job months ago when he started and he promised he was gonna quit because it was affecting us both, which he didn't.

Now I feel like he's starting to be manipulative and I need to know if I'm overreacting.",2,1760944218.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

I dropped it pretty early on, maybe 2 or 3 hours in because I was getting bored. I was talking to my friend about it who is currently on CS2 and making his way through, and when I explained the intro that I played, he had no idea what I was talking about and it seems like I am just having some kind of hallucination, because when I looked up playthroughs, it was nothing like what I played.

The game I played had a dark haired MC that looks exactly like the MC in CS1. He had the maroon school jacket and black pants, and it started off by me waking up and a blonde girl in a similar school outfit coming to pick me up and explaining to me about the Arts system and so on. I believe the MC was living above a coffee shop. About an hour in, something goes missing or someone has information that we need, so I follow him into the sewers to find his hideout, but he isn't there and we are attacked by some kind of soldiers who were after him. That is about where I stopped.

Now, the actual intros for the CS games are pretty much big team fights. Not this at all. I looked up walkthroughs on Youtube and nothing matches what I played at all. What the hell did I play? Does anyone have any clue? It looks pretty much exactly like CS1, but with better graphics, but it doesn't match any playthroughs I looked up online.",0,1760944102.0,JRPG,5,0.36,False

Right now I am rocking with a second hand Delonghi Stilosa. I have successfully upgraded the steam wand to the Rancillo Silvia wand, and I have a scale, a knock box, a WDT tool, a distributor, a Delonghi milk pitcher, a puck screen, a better tamper, a bottomless portafilter, and.. controversially the Kingrinder K2 as opposed to a more expensive model. 

To be quite honest, I am pretty happy with how far I have come with such a small budget and so little time with espresso as a concept (sittting at a total of about $300CAD and just about a month with espresso in general.)

Where do I go from here? My next biggest goal is getting better latte art. Well, getting latte art at all. I steam decent milk, I really just need to keep making cups and just practicing to improve in this area. In terms of gear, in the future I think I wanna stick with the Stilosa, as hated as it is by some. I will do the PID mod and the dimmer, pressure gauge, etc. 

And finally, in life. I have applied to a couple cafes relying on nothing but previous unrelated work experience and my obsessed attitude with learning the art of coffee. So far I have heard nothing back, but it’s been fun meeting so many new people and involving myself in my local coffee scene. Working as a barista is a bigger goal of mine as I am in school and I think I would love it part time to more rapidly improve and get paid to do what I love to do at home anyways.

Anyways, this has been a major yap. Can you tell I am up late due to too much caffeine? I sure can. Feel free to comment on.. anything in this post. Let’s talk!",1,1760944090.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I also don't mind (I love) surprises so if you have my address already feel free to send a postcard without letting me know beforehand.

As for the themes: I'm open to almost everything (although I'd rather not receive religious cards or anything that's not respectful). 

I would love: artsy stuff, specially if it's something from a small artist from your area/country, fall, christmas, winter, nature, animals, abstract art, halloween, queer, vintage cards, books, coffee, mushrooms, frogs, anything green... I also love star trek, horror tv shows, the office, gilmore girls...

After my mother died, there wasn’t much reason to — she’d been the last thing tying me there.

But when I saw the headline — “Thirty Years Since The Greenvale Flood” — something twisted inside me.

I don’t know why I did it, but that same weekend, I got in my car and drove back.



The highway was longer than I remembered, and for the last twenty miles, there were no other cars.
Just empty stretches of road, lined with trees that felt too still.

When I finally reached the turnoff, the old “Welcome to Greenvale” sign was still standing, leaning to one side.
Someone had spray-painted over it: CLOSED AREA – KEEP OUT.

But the road beyond looked fine.
Not washed out, not collapsed — just… forgotten.

I expected ruins.
What I found was home.



The houses stood exactly where I remembered them.
Same cracked sidewalks, same lampposts.
The gas station on the corner still had the faded sign for 79¢ coffee.

But what made me stop was the people.

There were people.

An old man mowing his lawn.
A woman hanging clothes to dry.
A kid riding a bike past me — the same model I had when I was ten.

I slowed down, rolled my window down.
“Hey,” I called out to the man mowing. “Is this… Greenvale?”

He cut the mower’s engine and looked at me like I’d asked if water was wet.
“Of course it is.”

Then he smiled politely and went back to mowing.



I parked near my old street.
The pavement was cracked but familiar.
I half-expected to see the treehouse my brother and I built behind our yard.

And when I walked down the block — I did.

Same wood. Same rope ladder. Even the initials carved in the trunk: D + M, 1989.

I reached out and touched them. The wood was dry, but the letters felt freshly cut.

A chill ran through me.



My old house looked untouched.
Paint a little faded, curtains still hanging in the same place.

Someone was inside.

Through the window, I saw movement — a woman walking through the kitchen.
For a second, I thought maybe someone new had moved in.

Then she turned her head slightly, and I froze.

It was my mother.

Not older, not changed — exactly as I remembered her in 1994.

I stepped back, heart pounding. The screen door creaked open, and she stepped out, wiping her hands on a towel.

“Danny?” she said softly. “What are you doing out here?”

Her voice — I swear to God — was real.

I couldn’t speak.

She frowned a little. “You look pale. Come inside, dear.”



I followed her in.
The smell hit me instantly — coffee and lavender detergent.
Everything was in its place. The same furniture, the same tablecloth, even the same photo of Dad on the mantel.

“I thought—” I started.

She turned to me, smiling faintly. “You thought what?”

“I thought you…” I couldn’t finish the sentence.

She smiled again, poured me a cup of coffee, and said, “You should rest. You’ve been gone a long time.”

I sat down, shaking.
Everything felt real — too real.



After a while, I went outside to get some air.
The street was quiet, the air heavy with that thick, pre-storm humidity.

Down the road, I saw someone standing by the old town square — a man about my age, wearing a tan jacket.

He waved me over.

When I got closer, I realized he looked familiar.
I couldn’t place him until he spoke.

“You shouldn’t be here,” he said.

“What do you mean?”

His eyes darted to the houses around us.
“It’s not what it looks like. They don’t move on here. They just stay the way they were.”

I swallowed hard. “Who are you?”

He hesitated, then said, “You were in my class. Fielding. Marcus Fielding.”

The name hit me like ice.
Marcus had lived two streets over.
He’d drowned in the flood trying to save his sister.

But there he was. Standing in front of me.



I must’ve gone pale, because he said, “You really don’t remember, do you?”

“Remember what?”

He pointed toward the riverbed.
“None of this should exist. The water took everything.”

I followed his gaze.
From here, I could still see the church steeple, the houses, the quiet streets.
Everything was still and perfect — like a photograph frozen in time.

Marcus sighed. “You didn’t make it out either, Dan.”

I laughed — a shaky, hollow sound. “I’m right here.”

He shook his head. “So am I.”



When I looked back toward the houses, the lights were on in every window — glowing warm, yellow, steady.

But no one was moving inside.
The shapes behind the curtains were still.

“Don’t let them talk to you again,” Marcus said quietly.
“Once you believe it, you stay.”

And then he was gone.

Not vanished — just… gone, like he’d never been there.



I ran back to the house.
The front door was open.
The TV was playing softly — a weather broadcast from decades ago.

“Residents are advised to evacuate immediately as water levels rise…”

The image flickered.

My mother was sitting in her chair, staring at the static screen.

“Mom,” I said, voice shaking.

She turned to me, her eyes blank, unfocused.
“Dinner’s almost ready,” she said. “Your brother’s still outside.”

Her voice trembled, like an old recording.



I stumbled out into the yard.
The air felt thicker now, and the smell — not lavender anymore, but mold and river silt.

Down the street, water shimmered at the intersection.
At first I thought it was rainwater. Then I realized it was spreading — slow, steady, reflecting the yellow lights.

I ran to my car, started the engine, and turned toward the main road.

But the sign was gone.
The road curved endlessly through fog.

The radio crackled — then came a voice.
Mine.

> “You shouldn’t be here.”





I don’t remember how I got out.
I woke up the next morning on the side of the highway, thirty miles from Greenvale.
My car was parked on the shoulder, keys still in the ignition.

I tried to drive back, but the turnoff wasn’t there.
The trees were thicker. The road freshly paved.

I asked a gas station attendant about Greenvale.

He frowned. “That’s the place that flooded, right? Back in ’94? Whole town went under. They built a reservoir over it.”

He pointed toward the valley.
“You can still see the church steeple when the water’s low.”

I drove there.

He was right.
The steeple was there — rusted, barely visible through the surface.

And near the edge of the memorial plaque, half-buried in moss, I found it.

My name.

1obd4fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiaryOfARedditor/comments/1obd4fp/real_10202025_reflections/,[real] (10/20/2025) reflections,"the past few weeks have really been testing me, and i've just been in the worst mood lately. there are a lot of reasons for this, most of which i won't get into here, but i haven't been to therapy in about a month because i'm moving internationally soon, and i decided to get off my antidepressants because there's a shortage where i'm moving. this move has been delayed multiple times, and it's partly my fault, even if it's mostly not my fault. i'm struggling with that a lot and it has been impacting my self-esteem a lot. this is the last time, though, and i should be getting ready to go very shortly. three weeks, max. i'm so excited, but i'm also very nervous.

what keeps me afloat is spending time with friends. it's strange because i've always considered myself to be a fairly asocial person. i don't spend a lot of time with people, i don't consider myself especially funny, charming, or interesting, and i've never been very popular and being popular and well-liked by people is not something that i particularly have ever chased. over the past year, though, i've been talking to people and occasionally asking them out for coffee, lunch, or just to have a chat and a walk around town, and it's been really, really wonderful. and i think through therapy, both individual and group, my life has changed considerably for the better in very tangible ways. i feel more anchored in my community, more empowered to build lasting relationships founded upon honesty and care, more curious about the world and my place in it, and, truthfully, more equipped to live the type of life that i want to live. that involves, shock and surprise, going out and making friends and asking them questions about themselves and opening up and talking about our lives. that requires a lot of openness. i'm not perfect at it, and there are many ways in which i fall short (one close friend cries a lot during our talks, and i'm glad i can be there for her, but wish i could do more to comfort her other than be there and listen), but it's been very nice to get to know people a little better. i like feeling connected. that doesn't scare me as much as it used to. (even if it does sting sometimes if someone blows you off, which happens now and then.)

it's just been this crazy realization that i don't have to be lonely, nor do i “deserve” to be lonely. i have plenty of faults but i'm not that bad. at least i'd like to think not. i've reached out to probably about fifty different people in this past year and i've become really good friends with some of them, and we just hang out for hours together. my therapist told me during our last appointment that it's been really wonderful to see the growth that i've made during our time together, and i felt really moved by that. i think i have grown a lot in ways i wasn't immediately able to see, and i'm very grateful for that growth. it's not just the fact that i'm talking to people that makes me feel like that, but it's the fact that i feel much different after i talk to them—lighter, calmer, more at ease—and i've felt more comfortable sharing my vulnerabilities with them because we are living and growing together, i guess, even if we're not always necessarily best friends. friends share things with each other, and that is part of the beauty of having people around you that you care about.

i realize that life happens and i will probably become very overwhelmed settling into my new environment and proximity makes things a lot easier so a lack thereof means we probably won’t talk much, but i still want to make an effort to keep up with those closest to me. and i hope we will still be friends and maintain and nurture the bonds we’ve made together for a long time. i don’t want to lose the friends i have, but i don’t think that will happen really.

i had more i wanted to talk about but i feel like i'm hitting a wall in terms of what i'm able to express rn. reading dense academic theory at 3am is inadvisable, and trying to do some deep reflection on what's going on in your psyche is during your study break is… well, yeah, it's no surprise i couldn't get too far into things lol.",1,1760943516.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

He’ll come home from outside, head straight to the kitchen, and start grabbing things (the refrigerator handle, the coffee jar, the drawer handles, etc.) without washing up first. I’ve also noticed that after using the bathroom, he just walks right out and goes about his business like it’s nothing.

I’ve asked him several times, as nicely as I could, to please wash his hands after using the bathroom or when he gets home. He just laughs it off and says I’m being dramatic or “too clean.”

To make things worse, he has this habit of touching his feet and fiddling with his toes while eating dinner. I pointed it out once because it kinda grossed me out ngl, and he told me I was overreacting and should 'chill out.'

I get that he’s going through a tough time and I don’t want to make things awkward while he’s staying here, but I’m starting to feel uncomfortable in my own kitchen. It’s hard to relax knowing he’s been touching everything after using the bathroom or playing with his feet.

1obcylz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1obcylz,The Best IEM Under $200  ?.?.?   (The Warm a soul with $179 ),"**Youtube Unboxing Video >>** [https://youtu.be/FEr9DzoogQM](https://youtu.be/FEr9DzoogQM)

I’ve been using this IEM for about a 2 week now, mostly paired with my iPhone 14 Pro Max and the Apple Lightning Dongle. (U.S. version)

Yeah, I know that’s a pretty basic setup. No fancy external DACs or amps this time.

But honestly, that’s part of the fun. It lets you hear what these IEMs really sound like without extra coloration or EQ trickery.

Just plug in, hit play, and find out what they can do in everyday use walking to work, grabbing coffee, zoning out to some music.

Later on, I’ll try the Frost with a dedicated DAP and share those impressions separately.

**First Impressions & Build,**

True to its name, Frost feels cold to the touch solid aluminum housing with a perfectly smooth finish.

It’s got that clean, icy sheen that catches the light without being flashy.

Build quality is absolutely top-tier for this price: no rough edges, no weird seams, and it fits in the ear like it was made for it.

The shells are compact, seal nicely, and stay put during long sessions without creating pressure spots.

Even the cable feels premium for its class soft, braided, non-microphonic, and the connectors are snug.

It’s a small thing, but if you’re using these on your daily commute, you’ll appreciate that level of refinement.

**Sound Signature,**

Smooth. Clean. Surprisingly Addictive.

In short, Frost isn’t for bassheads or treble chasers it’s for people who appreciate balance and maturity in tuning. It’s not a “woow” IEM that punches you with sub-bass or crispy highs right away.

Instead, it grows on you the longer you listen.

**Bass**

Controlled, tight, and nicely textured.

It doesn’t overwhelm the mix, yet provides enough body to give rhythm and groove.

There’s no mid-bass bleed, and nothing gets muddy.

It’s the kind of low end that supports the track rather than dominates it.

**Mids**

Here’s where the Frost earns its name smooth, neutral, with just a touch of warmth.

Vocals are natural and correctly placed in the mix.

Female voices (think Lana Del Rey) sound lush and creamy, while male vocals carry that studio-grade density without sounding thick.

Even straight out of the iPhone dongle, mids retain detail and texture, which shows the drivers are doing serious work on their own.

**Treble**

Detailed but never harsh.

You get enough air and sparkle to keep things lively, but it avoids the fatiguing sharpness that plagues many hybrids. Cymbals, hi-hats, and upper harmonics feel open yet smooth.

This isn’t an analytical treble like what you’d hear from an Etymotic or Moondrop Blessing 3 it’s more musical, more forgiving, but still revealing.

**Technical Performance;**

This is where Frost punches well above its price.

The soundstage isn’t the largest, but the imaging and separation are spot-on.

Everything feels clean, organized, and tonally coherent.

Transient response is fast not razor-sharp like some all-BA sets, but natural and consistent.

iPhone + Apple Dongle Synergy

**Honestly? Surprisingly good..**

Apple still uses Cirrus Logic DACs, and they pair beautifully here.

The Frost doesn’t need much power, and the dongle drives it cleanly with great dynamics.

Sure, a high-end DAC or DAP would open up the stage and add a bit more sub-bass weight,

but you’re already getting about 90% of its potential right out of the Lightning jack and that’s impressive.

**Genre Pairing**

Acoustic / Jazz / Indie: Excellent  fluid and emotional.

Pop / R&B: Balanced and enjoyable, vocals really shine.

Metal / EDM: Maybe a bit too polite lacks some slam.

Classical: Beautiful layering and timbre; strings sound natural.

**Comparisons**

If I had to place it in context:

Tonally close to the Letshuoer Cadenza 4.

Smoother and more organic than the Moondrop Aria.

Similar to SeeAudio Yume II, though Frost has a softer treble roll-off.

If you chase absolute resolution, there are sharper options out there.

But if you want something you can listen to for hours without fatigue, the Frost makes a strong case for itself.

**Final Thoughts**

The BQEYZ Frost feels like that quiet, confident friend who doesn’t need to shout to be heard.

It doesn’t try to wow you with exaggerated dynamics instead, it wins you over with consistency, finesse, and honest tonality.

In a world where every new IEM tries to be a marketing monster, Frost brings a refreshing dose of old-school maturity.

Pair it with something as simple as an iPhone and Apple Dongle, and you’ve got a portable, neutral, genuinely enjoyable setup.

If you’re a detail chaser looking for the ultimate resolution, maybe look elsewhere.

But if you value texture, warmth, and musical honesty Frost deserves your attention.

**Verdict**

Smooth & balanced tuning

Natural mids and vocals

Tight, textured bass without bloat

Pairs beautifully with iPhone dongle

Best for: relaxed listening, acoustic, jazz, and vocal-heavy music

Endoscopy on the 14th showed 4 ulcers in my stomach but none actively bleeding.

I was in the ER Sunday, CT was fine . Just high heart rate (160 standing, 140 sitting, 120 laying.) higher BP but not dangerous . Troponin was concerning but it lowered so thats good.

Was transfered to a room at a more equipped hospital. Doc came in told me he compared my blood levels from 3 weeks prior to now and it seems i lost almost 5 pints with the numbers.

Tuesday I had an endoscopy done, there were 4 ulcers in there but no active bleeding.

Never threw up at hospital. But what had happened was I threw up 30-40 times in 3 hours Sunday (12th) morning from 330am to 630am . Ignored my GF about the coffee ground looking vomit and went to bed. Woke up, went to pee, lost my vision and hearing and got dizzy. My dumbass said fuck it and went back to bed. 2 hours later woke up again to pee (i got isues waking to pee) and wasnt feeling well. Went upstairs to talk to my mom , on the way up lost my vision and hearing again, but worse somehow, and when I got to our kitchen I collapsed and was loopy in the floor. Got up peed and tried laying down . After I got up I collapsed 2 more times. Went to ER. Collapsed on the way in the door. Not losing hearing or seeing those times just falling.

Fast forward to NOW - I'm home. I ate some breaded fish . Ive had a burning stomach and belching for hours. Had a sharp intense pain for a minute or two. Freaked out . And I just threw up in the back of my throat and now im freaking out that the bleeding has started again . Ive woken up with the worst type of headache every day. The kind where moving feels like an ice pick and i can feel my heart in my head.

Anyone have experience with multiple ulcers? Is it normal to throw up without it being a bleed?!?

Goodness, I fear that no environment would be soft enough for my amorphous brain and sometimes, I cannot help but get angry at the cosmos for providing me with such a sensitive and challenging silhouette. Ease and comfort has always eluded me. Would it surprise you to know that I am indeed a positive influence? When in the company of another, my heart and positivity is second to none-trust is as natural as tripping over. I like to be alone but my triggers prevent me from doing so.

So what? Nobody was to blame and otherworldly wisdom was indeed gained. I am at peace with the all that transpired, my illusions, their predecessors and my mistakes. I trust that the universe will clear any dutiful debris, and that all will be well enough soon. I still worry that I will be punished for my faults. Truthfully, I made a confidant out of my fears and told them my secrets. Illusion held my hand, wiped my eyes, taught me love, courage, forgiveness and friendship. If I am punished as a result, I will accept the consequences gladly! My only motive was getting better and your comfort. I am sorry for such folly, I honestly thought that you could hear me. In hindsight, I really hope that you could not😂 I was a total fool! Equally, I don’t want to get wrong for what I done wrong! Healing is messy, dark, experimental and brutally insidious.

 🧡 Farewell, person who I’m afraid wants to lock me up🔐🔐 In the meantime, I ought to put my healing to good use! I love breathing life into people, speaking wise words and loving them unconditionally. Gosh, I’m free when I’m contained by expectation 🫶🏻🫶🏻 I loved loving you, and regret nothing! Alas, I regret spilling paint on my new books😣 A mentor of mine asked me this “what’s so bad about not obsessing over a worry?” Absolutely nothing! I cannot do anymore than I have to prevent a catastrophic event. Balance responsibility with faith. Responsibly and faith. This letter was a poor attempt to release my concerns, and a mere excuse to write like I’m an Earnest Hemingway’s less educated groupie. I’m more like a Poundland version of Sigmund Freud 😂 ha!

I am a 30-year old woman and I joined a gym a month ago. I am always training with the treadmill in front of the main door. I notified this guy, he’s probably 10-year older than me but he’s always coming with his bike and takes the treadmill close to me. But there’s always a space between us. One time, he arrived and I made eye contact with him. Then I thought nothing much of it but I thought he was really cute.

Then one day he come’s again but looks me in the eye and smile at me. I was so glad. A few days later he came back to the gym but has put he’s bike inside the gym in front of me (it’s always outside usually) and I noticed a baby seat. Once he started to work toward the gym he looked at me again and smiled.

So basically I’d love to talk to him but I’m a bit insecure and I don’t know if that’s a good idea. Are guys ok with girls making the first move? I wanted to invite him for a coffee or something like that but I’m scared that he’s not single.",0,1760941476.0,dating_advice,12,0.5,False

I'm a 25-year-old Bengali guy born and raised in Kolkata, and lately I've been wanting to explore the city a bit more - the cafés, hidden food joints, old north Kolkata streets, art galleries, maybe some random weekend plans too.

Would love to find a female friend around a similar age who's also up for hanging out, talking about anything under the sun, and just having a good time without pressure or drama. I'm chill, easy to talk to, and more into genuine connections than anything superficial.

If you also miss having someone to share spontaneous plans or long chats over coffee with, feel free to DM or drop a comment

1obcinb,https://i.redd.it/9x78odzxl7wf1.png,EcoModities™ — Latest EMX Update & Commodity Climate Pulse,"Here’s a fresh update from **EcoModities™**, our climate-sustainability index for commodities that merges ESG/transition data with market signals.

# 📊 Key EMX scores (last 3 months)

* Corn : **95.89**
* Cocoa : **91.39**
* Coffee : **74.47**
* Sugar : **31.87**
* Wheat : **97.75**

These numbers reflect how “eco-premium” pressures (such as climate policy, rainfall/heat anomalies, supply-chain stress) are being priced into these markets. Lower score = downward adjustment from recent elevated stress/risk; higher = sustained premium.

# 🧠 What it means

Over the past quarter, the EMX readings show that commodities like **coffee** and **sugar** are seeing a sharper pull-back in sustainability/transition risk pricing, while **corn** and **wheat** remain comparatively resilient.  
In short: the market appears to be normalizing after a period of elevated climate-risk premia. If you’re writing about commodity outlooks, this may inform both trade ideas and thematic coverage.
