1qkcjmg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkcjmg,[Seoul]A Café to Enjoy During a Riverside Stroll(mahogany café),"Nestled among the skyscrapers of Gwanghwamun and right beside Cheonggyecheon Stream, this café offers the perfect spot to sit by the window, watch the flowing water and people strolling by, and soak in a moment of relaxation. There’s no better place to catch your breath in the bustling city.

The space is spacious, so even during rush hours seats are usually available, though window seats are highly sought after and harder to secure. The best time to visit is around 4 p.m. After lunch, you can take a leisurely walk along Cheonggyecheon, then drop by the café for delicious cake and drinks, enjoy the view outside, and later head to a nearby restaurant for dinner—a perfect way to savor the city’s charm.

Mahogany is a specialty coffee brand operated by the famous cake brand Dore Dore.

Its signature pairing is a large, flaky croissant with a rich cream-topped cold brew. Alongside, you’ll find a variety of delightful desserts, including the well-loved “Rainbow Cake,” making it a feast for both the eyes and the palate.

With high ceilings and a refined wood-toned interior, the café feels open and inviting. The seating is comfortably spaced, making it ideal not only for conversations with friends but also for solo work or reading while gazing out at Cheonggyecheon.

Of course, being located in a busy commercial area by the famous stream, it can get crowded, so those seeking a quiet atmosphere may prefer elsewhere. Still, if you’re looking for a place like Starbucks where you can focus on work alone or chat with friends, this café is highly recommended.

1qkcjk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1qkcjk5/positive_recovery_story/,Positive Recovery Story,"Hello, I (36.5F) had my tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy on January 6th. An inauspicious date to be sure. Just wanted to add my experience to the many positive recovery stories. I was extremely anxious before surgery but now that it's over I almost forget it even happened and I'm so happy to not have foul-smelling tonsil stones in my mouth. 

tl;dr: My surgery went great, the pain never exceeded a 4/10, I was back to work (from home) by day 8, and now I have a tongue that is pink and breath that smells normal-bad/coffee bad instead of truly offensive.

Recommendations: Humidifier, stool softener + laxative, aloe water, ice pack you can wrap around your face, mucinex instasoothe cough drops, chloroseptic max throat spray, really short walks outside if you can, and most critically take your meds on schedule. 

From my Notes app (cleaned up for grammar/spelling):

Day 1 - 8am arrival at surgery center with a 9:30am start time. Procedure lasted ~30 minutes. The only scary part was being transferred to the operating room and put on the table. I was worried about the anesthesia but when they put the mask on me I was out immediately and, from my perspective, woke up exactly 1 second later lol Didn't wake up with any pain and ate 2 grape slushies immediately. Pain < 1 all day.

Day 2 - Waking up at night to take medicine sucked but kept pain < 1. My throat is so swollen that when I sleep on my back I snore or start awake because the air can't escape my nose. Got in a 20 minute walk. White scabs starting to form in back of throat by end of day.

Pathology report indicated acute inflammation, tonsil stones, deep crypts, and a mucosal cyst. 

Day 3 - Slept through hydrocodone alarm and woke at 2am with 3/10 pain. Slept on and off throughout day. Some pain but mostly pressure/tightness as well as teeth and tongue tenderness in the early morning/evening. Took a 30 minute walk. 

Day 4 - Pain was consistently a 3/10 all day, very tired, no appetite. Discomfort worse morning/night.

Day 5 - Slept through hydrocodone alarm again and woke up with pain 4/10. Some ear, throat, and teeth pain as well pressure/tightness. Increased hydrocodone from 5ml to 6ml to try to sleep through to next pain reliever alarm. 

Day 6 - Forgot to turn on my alarms and slept from midnight to 5:30am. Briefly woke up with 3.5 pain but improved quickly with water. By end of day felt I had turned the corner. 

Day 7 - Basically back to normal. Pain waking me up throughout night but not exceeding 2/10. 

Day 8 - Woke up every couple hours from pain since only taking Tylenol/Ibuprofen at this point. Work was a pain in the ass but nothing terrible. 

Day 14 - Post-op appt looks good and I'm cleared to return to normal activities

We think being wealthy or happily married would be a miracle. But miracles feel rare and distant. Manifestation requires naturalness.



If you treat your desire like a huge special event, your subconscious thinks ""this isn't normal for us"" and rejects it. You have to normalize the extraordinary.



Make it boring. Imagine having the money and feeling neutral about it, just like you feel about the money in your wallet right now.

It’s a dumb crush because she’s extremely professional so whatever persona she’s putting on to acquiesce us employees, it definitely does not represent her actual personality.

Managing a cumulative **$45 Million+ (RMB 300M+)** in GMV has taught me one hard truth:

**""Logistics doesn't just deliver products; it delivers Customer Experience.""**

In the world of DTC, scaling from 100 to 10,000 orders a day is not a marketing problem—it’s a **supply chain resilience** problem. Most founders focus on CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), but they often ignore the ""hidden leak"" in their backend:

🔹 **Lead Time Fragility:** A 2-day delay in sourcing can lead to a 20% drop in customer satisfaction. 🔹 **Inventory Inefficiency:** Misaligned stock levels are the primary reason for cash flow crises. 🔹 **The ""Unboxing"" Gap:** If your packaging doesn't scream ""Brand,"" you're just another commodity.

I’ve spent the last decade architecting **End-to-End Fulfillment Solutions** that prioritize agility and scalability over just ""cheap shipping.""

Whether you are a founder looking to optimize your **Sourcing-to-Door** cycle or a VC looking for supply chain insights for your portfolio companies, let’s connect.

I’m a 27M, recently divorced, no kids, make about 5k a month, work remote and looking for a major change in my life. I currently live in the Pacific Northwest. I’ve been intrigued to move to Florida ever since my divorce. I’m mainly looking for a new vibe, new friends and eventually a new relationship.

What would life be like for someone in my situation out there? What’s the dating scene like? Are girls looking to get married or just have fun? Would you say the majority of people are liberal or conservative? I’m looking to get married again and have a family, and although I’m not in a rush, I don’t want to go somewhere where people are too political. That’s why I’m leaving Portland/Seattle.

I have nearly no functional family to rely on, and that friends essentially ARE my family. 

What triggered this spiral was a friend of mine who mutually reciprocated a romantic interest in me just started infodumping to me about his crush...and while I didnt mess anything up we as friends are long distance. I needed to set a boundary and walk away. 

My parents are addicts, so I never grew up with consistency. I had no friends for nearly the entirety of my childhood years until junior yr of HS. After that, I carved my way into making plenty of friends, especially in college and now never want to go back to how lonely I once was. I had a boyfriend too, everything felt set until we broke up, but at least it helped me address alot of my anxious attachment wounds. 

But I'm terrified about how things will change for me as an adult, as everyone else around me will start to get into relationships, we will all be moving away for jobs one day, etc. I want to carve out a future for myself where I have people to just ""hang out with"" and not always ""catch up with"" behind a mask. I feel so filthy for admitting I want to see friends multiple times a week. Keep having close ones come over as if they're just casual family. I just want to maintain genuine human connection, not the fake catching up over coffee stuff (unless if it's a new friendship!). 

My grandma has a friend like this, and she says it comes off as needy. But what else are we supposed to do when family is not an option? When we don't have a partner? Is wanting companionship so wrong? Wanting to grow old with a friend if I cant find a partner is bad? 

I want a partner eventually one day too. But with how damaged I feel, I wonder if I'll ever get to the point of ever having a partner again.

i moved here a while ago and found that making friends as an adult (especially while in school) is… harder than expected. classes blur together, everyone’s busy, and before you know it months pass. i’d love to connect with people who are also open to intentional, low-pressure friendships that grow naturally.

More like a buisness rather than human.","I’m 28M gonna be 29M in June I posted this similar thing a couple days ago. Here’s what I’m tired of I feel like everytime I talk to a girl I get to know her I ask her out on a date. There’s just something that feels like I don’t know. I get this feeling like dating is like a Buisness. And I don’t like that mindset, but it feels at times like it is. Like I’ve said this many times in the past. That why is it so hard to get a yes. I’m not trying to be forceful am asking about myself. Like I feel like just asking out a girl. Just to meet up for drinks or for coffee. Is like the hardest thing in the world. Like I feel like I don’t know if it’s the majority of woman. And I’m not trying to blame them. But I feel like them just getting to want to hang out even as a friends thing. it’s like in their eyes. They feel the same way and employee feel when they’re talking to a job applicant. or the way police do when their interviewing a suspect in a crime like. I feel like every little thing you bring up could make them go from being interested to not less than a couple minutes. Like every little thing is watched very very closely. Like I feel like little things like I stumble on a word, I lose eye contact, or I lose my focus like we could have virtually all the same interests all the same hobbies, but just it feels like that one little thing will destroy it. Like the thing I’m asking is like how can I get the girl in the mood enough or she would feel comfortable to saying yes. And I’m not even talking about just romantic things I’m talking about just hangouts or something that might just be a one time gig.

And I’ve tried everything even dating apps when I use them I get like three or four likes when most people by the end of the week will get like 20 likes. And the type of girls that like me are either unattractive or they live in another state or 300 miles away. And all the women I know the majority of them all have boyfriends that’s another thing that I want to know is. I don’t know this personally for a statistic. I live in San Diego California in the Vista area. but I kind of wonder in my geographical location like if someone were to run a statistic men outnumber women in the overall population. Is that why it’s harder to find single women. Like 70% of them of all the women that I know they either tell me they have a boyfriend or I see they do on their social media feeds.

For about five years, I had this real anger toward women. I never told them particularly about it, especially women that I was friends with or knew friends. But I would tell my guy friends how I’m sick of the constant rejection and and I was tired of feeling like trying to get a girl to go out with you. I feel like I said it shouldn’t be like trying to get a job at a Wall Street bank. Like back in 2019 in 2020 I asked out like probably 50 women both those years and almost every single one of them were rejections. and that’s when my feelings about dating and about the world just started to Harden. I felt entitled I felt that women owed me something and I felt like I shouldn’t have to do anything to change. They should just put up with it. and now I know that was not a healthy feeling to have. I was just tired of the constant rejection and the constant getting turned down. It wasn’t any of the girls fault. My deep down anger was really at myself because I felt pity and self loathing and just I hated myself. But now I’ve become more self-aware. I’ve abandoned that feeling because I knew it wasn’t healthy. I’ve started trying to own up to my own problems. Now the question I ask is what can I do? I was just lonely angry and sad. And I felt no one cared about me. Like I was just invisible, not just woman but many freinds I had. Began to stop talking to me. Even though I didn’t ever have any arguments or disagreements That got out of hand. I just felt so unloved Sometimes I do have feelings and questions about like why does it have to be this way but I’m not like somebody who’s constantly angry or trying to pin the blame on women or society as a whole anymore like I was for a long time.

I feel there has been some improvement last week. I went to this girls birthday party. She just turned 29. A couple months before that back in October these two sisters, who are both in their 30s one of them as a bartender at a bar I go to regularly. They both have boyfriends, but I went to a rock concert at this bar in Oceanside on Halloween night. It was a black Sabbath cover band. So I would say there has been some progress, but I feel like it’s not even remotely close to where I want it to be. The last girlfriend I had was about a year ago and we dated for about 7 months. It was the longest girlfriend I ever had. She was five years old than me. I was 26. She was 32. But before her, the last girlfriend I had was in high school my senior year. I was 17 and she was 17 we dated for about three months. I’ve only had two serious girlfriends, and I’ve only been out like on three dates in my life. so that’s pretty much five women I’ve gone out with.

Last time I asked out a girl was like back in October. And the reason I have an asked out that many women is because I because of that thing just the constant feeling of getting shot down. And that’s still the hardest barrier it’s not that I don’t know what to do or how to talk to the woman. It’s the response.",0,1769128930.0,TalkTherapy,1,0.5,False

Hi,
Today I thought I was being smart and took the metal drip tray off my espresso machine to use as a makeshift grill over my stove to brew a moka pot of coffee. Initially, as I was heating up the grill, I recognized potential danger with fumes and turned the exhaust fans on high prior to putting the moka pot down on the stove. Thinking I had eliminated any dangers from the drip tray i.e., mold/potential coatings on the metal I didn't think to consider the moka pot itself and the thermodynamics of the makeshift grill and its effect on the heating process of the moka pot. I don't know enough about transfer of heat/metal, but I assume the heat didn't distribute evenly and thus became overly hot in spots rather than evenly across the moka pot. I didn't consider whatsoever the danger of that and the fact there is a rubber gasket inside the moka pot. After the coffee brewed which I stood there the entire time watching over waiting for standing a step back from the stove in distance (which took longer than usual, though I thought that was just due to the stove being in the way) I poured the coffee and finished it... and then tried to clean the pot. The top gasket rubber had fused onto the lower portafilter. And so, having already been concerned previously about fumes from the drip tray, I now considered rubber fumes. In the 30 minutes since, I believe I've had a headache, which has now subsided. I know that because I've shown signs of improvement, it's unlikely that anything serious has taken place; however, I wanted to confirm. Is there anything I should be on the lookout for or be aware of in the coming day or so? Do I need medical attention? What are the harms from low-exposure inhalation of rubber fumes?

How often do you fight with your spouse? Is what I'm experiencing, normal?

Does anyone have any tips for navigating conversations about personal time?

What's a reasonable amount of time to take for myself?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife needs a lot of emotional and mental support. She has a stressful work environment, experiences a lot of traditional pressure in her family, and she suffers from severe PMDD and some form of anxiety. We both work full time, have no kids, and I manage daily domestic tasks like the cleaning, dishes and laundry. Having to do more around the house during these times is no issue for me especially if it means my wife gets to relax.

Unfortunately I am starting to feel resentful and emotional burnout from her relying on me, partially because I have no time for myself to recover. She relies on me to maintain emotional steadiness as she is prone to panic attacks, and feels unloved if I am not able to anticipate her mood changes. Although I ask frequently, she doesn't feel cared for if: I ask directly about her needs and she has to spell things out for me, if I'm not completely attuned to her mood and the situation. E.g.  I cook breakfast every morning but didn't include enough protein for a meal while on her period. Although I have it typically marked on my calendar, she has gotten upset that I wasn't considerate of her.

I understand that she needs a lot of care and to continue supporting her I feel I need time to recharge, but conflict breaks out when I state that I would like to work out, spend some time with friends, or add to my professional development. I want to make some headway writing my new book which would require at least 3-5 hours a week of research, reading, or writing. I also care a lot about my fitness so I would like to fit in workouts \~2 hours a week. Most of these things can be completed from my home office and home gym. If I could schedule the occasional coffee to see some of my friends, that would be incredible for my mental health. 

Unfortunately, this starts a lot of fights with her as she feels like I am taking away our couple time.

What's a reasonable compromise for time that you make in your relationship to make this work? Is there anything I can do to help navigate this and not be emotionally burnt out?

*Current Barriers:*

\- **Hostility towards conversation:** My wife becomes hostile at the suggestion of me having personal time. Most conversations are perceived as me wanting to be away from her which results in an argument, or her becoming anxious or disappointed in the relationship.  
\- **My wife values spending time in parallel**. For instance, she would like to wake up together on our days off, but we have different wake times and I might be awake a few hours before she is. If I am on my phone when she wakes up this turns into an argument. I can't leave bed before she wakes or she feels like she is left behind. I value her comfort it is important to me for her to feel loved, but I feel like she doesn't value my time the same way.  
\- **She doesn't want to have separate hobbies** so we end up doing what she prefers  
\- **Arguments are exhausting, explosive and can last 2-6 hours of a day, and sometimes 2-3x a week**. **There are so many triggers to our fights that it's almost unavoidable.**  Our fights are best described as anxious-avoidant dances. My wife becomes more aggressive and I tend to lose focus and disengage despite my best efforts to stay present. This results in her doubling down and becoming more anxious, then sometimes turns into a panic attack. After the fights, my wife experiences emotional hangovers that she feels are my responsibility to help her recover from in the days to follow.

It's important that I don't do anything to remind her of previous arguments, but the pile of triggers is mounting, the fights seem cumulative, and I feel like I'm slowly burning out trying to manage or avoid those triggers.

*Considerations:*

*-* I suspect my wife might have a form of anxiety that she might need more support than I can provide, but she doesn’t open up to her friends and comes from a background where mental health is not discussed with family or community.

\- I am in weekly therapy to help learn how better to talk to her better, as to trigger her sadness less and hopefully have these conversations from a more regulated space on my end.

\- My wife and I attend therapy monthly and separately and I have suggested going to couples therapy but we are not attending at this time and are discussing returning.

\- My wife needed a lot of support prior to being married, but these fights started happening around our engagement. I assumed it was just wedding planning pressure but",1,1769128519.0,relationships,7,0.67,False

1qkbw0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1qkbw0m/moments_that_hopefully_remain/,Moments That Hopefully Remain,"They say to write down your feelings  
to release some of them —  
so I guess that’s why I’m here.

Firstly, I feel sad.  
Honestly, I am heartbroken —  
not over something that has happened,  
but over something I feel is coming.

I can’t shake the feeling  
that I’m only delaying the inevitable,  
holding on until the bitter end —  
even though I don’t want us to end in bitterness.  
Because I love deeply.  
More than words could ever show.

I hope I’m wrong, but—  
I don’t know if I’m being too optimistic,  
still hoping things can be figured out.  
I’ll do what I need to do.  
I’ll get the help I need.  
And I hope you can see  
that I’m already working on it —  
not just for you,  
but for me too.

I can’t force anything to stay,  
and I wouldn’t want to.  
I’ve always meant it  
when I said I want what’s best,  
even if that means letting go.

I don’t need it to be gentle —  
sometimes that hurts more.  
Better to rip it off like a band‑aid,  
let the pain come clean and quick,  
so healing can begin  
and I can learn how to be without them.

I’ll admit it though —  
I’m scared.  
Scared of the last time  
I’ll hear your voice,  
the last time I wake up beside you,  
the last time I fall asleep next to you.  
Scared of the last pinky promise,  
the last anything and everything  
that once felt certain.

Last smile — chin crease with dimples.  
Last laugh — the kind that brightened my world.  
The last teasing remark  
I always acted like I didn’t like,  
but not‑so‑secretly loved.

The last song shared.  
The last concert.  
The last time I make a pot of coffee  
just for us.  
I can’t imagine  
not sharing moments like these.

So until the end,  
I’ll hold every moment gently —  
even knowing it hurts.  
I might reach for the “I love yous,”  
the small annoying reassurances,  
the time that still exists —  
not to trap you,  
but because it still means something to me.  
You will always mean something to me.

I don’t want this love to end.  
I want it to last.  
But more than anything,  
I want us to be okay —  
whatever that ends up looking like.",2,1769128364.0,Poems,1,0.75,False

The first date went well we went to a restaurant then a bar. He asked me out on a second date the day after for the weekend coming. On the second date we met in the city and walked around, had lunch then went to a bar. We didn’t kiss on either.

Toward the end of the second date I was trying to break the ice as I felt there wasn’t much conversation flow. I can’t remember how it exactly started but we started speaking about how I want to be a therapist one day so I started pretending to be a therapist asking him what he struggles with, he wanted it to be hypothetical at first then he said he struggles with social anxiety and explained how he wouldn’t have the confidence to approach a woman. He said ‘obviously I asked you out but that was over text.’ I felt kind of deflated at this point. He also said he feels like he takes it too slow sometimes (this would make sense).

Anyways I asked him out on a third date the day after no response for a day so sent another message then he apologised said he didn’t get the message and that he can find a date. No message for 2 days so I asked him if he found one and he suggested coffee and walk so I said yes. No message for a day so I suggested a day and time on the weekend, no response so far. I always see he silenced his notifications. He also never messages asking his my day is.

1qkbp9h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkbp9h,Why I Never Forget What I Study Anymore?,"This tool solved the **two biggest problems** I faced when I started college: **heavy memorization** and **lack of time**.

I really struggled with memorization. I tried everything you can imagine—taking notes, summarizing, solving lots of questions—but nothing worked for me in the long run except **one method**: **Spaced Repetition**.  
The idea is simple: you review each lesson at **specific, spaced intervals**.

A lot of people know about spaced repetition, but many don’t know how to use it **properly**.

Personally, I had no idea how to consistently review each lecture on its own over time—until I found something genius.

It’s a [Notion template](https://lnk.ua/5V1oBo54d) that one of my classmates recommended, and honestly, I’ve been using it since my first year. It helped me a lot with **memorization** and **time management**.

You can add every lecture you study into a table (each subject has its own table), and the system automatically tells you the **exact days** you should review it. After each review, you just check it off—this way, you’re almost guaranteed **never to forget** what you studied.

And it’s not just about memorization.

The template has a **clean, organized interface** that helps you manage your daily tasks and **track your progress**.  
Each subject has its own page where you can:

* Follow up on your reviews
* See what you’ve already studied
* Know what you still need to study

And of course, everything is **fully customizable**, so you can adjust it exactly the way you like.

So let’s imagine a simple day:

You start your day with a cup of coffee and open Notion.

1. First, you check what you need to review today and quickly start reviewing.
2. After finishing each review, you tick it off.
3. Then you look at your task list, add new tasks and lectures.
4. As you complete each task, you check it off as well.
5. Finally, once you finish a lecture, you add it to the table so the system schedules your future review dates automatically.

That’s it—simple, organized, and effective.

**Good luck to everyone 🤍**

I (34M) and my partner (40F) have been having consistent problems for about 3 years now, most communcation issues (e.g.: I come hme from work and she sighs, gets up, and goes to her bedroom), yet normally name calling and - although not as often but still pretty frequently - hitting or throwing objects at me.

I've wanted to go to couples counseling with her and every time I have talked about it, she has said to me that if I wasn't such an asshole, there wouldn't be many problems, so I don't bring it up anymore. I wish we could share the onus and desire of salvaging our relationship.

For the past 5 months, I have been sleeping in our spare room because she believed my seasonal allergies was a cold (again), and for the year we have stopped saying, ""I love you"" to each other as she wouldn't reply when I would say it on the phone or over text. Over the last 2 almost 3 years, she has said, ""I hate you"" to me what seems like at least once per week or two weeks. Although I feel that in my heart I want our relationship to be how it was (loving, fun, cuddling, holding hands, talking to each other about our day, hopes and dreams, etc.), I believe that our relationship is over and that the only reason she has me around is for contributing to bills, groceries, etc., it feels very transactional now.

With that said, this past week, I came home with a coffee, and I was berated about how I am a selfish asshole who only thinks of himself. FYI at Thanksgiving I brought her a pumpkin spice drink and then next day, a French vanilla, only to be told that I don't pay enough attention as she stopped drinking sugary drinks like coffee and had them with dumped down the drain in front of me.

So, to return to my question, would you make plans for dinner on what is supposed to be a romantic day for someone who doesn't love you anymore?

TL;DR: my girlfriend tells me that she hates, that any day she could let me go and pack my bags, and some times hits me and throws things at me, yet calls me selfish for getting a coffee after work. Would you make plans for a dinner date or no?

Here’s what I’m tired of I feel like everytime I talk to a girl I get to know her I ask her out on a date. There’s just something that feels like I don’t know. I get this feeling like dating is like a Buisness. And I don’t like that mindset, but it feels at times like it is. Like I’ve said this many times in the past. That why is it so hard to get a yes. I’m not trying to be forceful am asking about myself. Like I feel like just asking out a girl. Just to meet up for drinks or for coffee. Is like the hardest thing in the world. Like I feel like I don’t know if it’s the majority of woman. And I’m not trying to blame them. But I feel like them just getting to want to hang out even as a friends thing. it’s like in their eyes. They feel the same way and employee feel when they’re talking to a job applicant. or the way police do when their interviewing a suspect in a crime like. I feel like every little thing you bring up could make them go from being interested to not less than a couple minutes. Like every little thing is watched very very closely. Like I feel like little things like I stumble on a word, I lose eye contact, or I lose my focus like we could have virtually all the same interests all the same hobbies, but just it feels like that one little thing will destroy it. Like the thing I’m asking is like how can I get the girl in the mood enough or she would feel comfortable to saying yes. And I’m not even talking about just romantic things I’m talking about just hangouts or something that might just be a one time gig.

And I’ve tried everything even dating apps when I use them I get like three or four likes when most people by the end of the week will get like 20 likes. And the type of girls that like me are either unattractive or they live in another state or 300 miles away. And all the women I know the majority of them all have boyfriends that’s another thing that I want to know is. I don’t know this personally for a statistic. I live in San Diego California in the Vista area. but I kind of wonder in my geographical location like if someone were to run a statistic men outnumber women in the overall population. Is that why it’s harder to find single women. Like 70% of them of all the women that I know they either tell me they have a boyfriend or I see they do on their social media feeds.

For about five years, I had this real anger toward women. I never told them particularly about it, especially women that I was friends with or knew friends. But I would tell my guy friends how I’m sick of the constant rejection and and I was tired of feeling like trying to get a girl to go out with you. I feel like I said it shouldn’t be like trying to get a job at a Wall Street bank. Like back in 2019 in 2020 I asked out like probably 50 women both those years and almost every single one of them were rejections. and that’s when my feelings about dating and about the world just started to Harden. I felt entitled I felt that women owed me something and I felt like I shouldn’t have to do anything to change. They should just put up with it. and now I know that was not a healthy feeling to have. I was just tired of the constant rejection and the constant getting turned down. It wasn’t any of the girls fault. My deep down anger was really at myself because I felt pity and self loathing and just I hated myself. But now I’ve become more self-aware. I’ve abandoned that feeling because I knew it wasn’t healthy. I’ve started trying to own up to my own problems. Now the question I ask is what can I do? I was just lonely angry and sad. And I felt no one cared about me. Like I was just invisible, not just woman but many freinds I had. Began to stop talking to me. Even though I didn’t ever have any arguments or disagreements That got out of hand. I just felt so unloved Sometimes I do have feelings and questions about like why does it have to be this way but I’m not like somebody who’s constantly angry or trying to pin the blame on women or society as a whole anymore like I was for a long time.

I feel there has been some improvement last week. I went to this girls birthday party. She just turned 29. A couple months before that back in October these two sisters, who are both in their 30s one of them as a bartender at a bar I go to regularly. They both have boyfriends, but I went to a rock concert at this bar in Oceanside on Halloween night. It was a black Sabbath cover band. So I would say there has been some progress, but I feel like it’s not even remotely close to where I want it to be. The last girlfriend I had was about a year ago and we dated for about 7 months. It was the longest girlfriend I ever had. She was five years old than me. I was 26. She was 32. But before her, the last girlfriend I had was in high school my senior year. I was 17 and she was 17 we dated for about three months. I’ve only had two serious girlfriends, and I’ve only been out like on three dates in my life. so that’s pretty much five women I’ve gone out with.

Last time I asked out a girl was like back in October. And the reason I have an asked out that many women is because I because of that thing just the constant feeling of getting shot down. And that’s still the hardest barrier it’s not that I don’t know what to do or how to talk to the woman. It’s the response.",1,1769127674.0,therapy,1,1.0,False

So, here is the thing…

It seems like I am not losing weight, or it is extremely slow. I work as a driver, so I have to admit I don’t drink water all day so I don’t have to go the public toilets… I drink one coffee a day, and in the daytime I try to eat protein pouches or a little sandwich with higher protein. 

Then I come home, I eat some veggies, chicken or fish and mostly sweet potato, baby potatoes or wholegrain / edamame pasta. I try to hit 100g protein per day, so if I am  not hitting my goal, I make a protein shake.

My exercise routine is the following (at home with weight plates, dumbbells, ankle and wrist weights, depends what I am doing):

Monday: Leg and butt day

Tuesday: HIIT or moderate full body pilates for 40 minutes

Wednesday: arm, shoulder and back 

Thursday: pilates exercises / hourglass workouts

Friday: abs / general strenght

Saturday: light pilates / light full body workout + hourglass 

Sunday: rest day

I don’t really walk around during the day, sometimes I ‘dance’ (if we can call it that) in my room, but that’s all. As a driver, I am out for 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so I am sitting most of the time.

My salt intake is… pretty high.

My water intake is very low. And I don’t know how to increase it because water makes me nauseous for some unknown reasons.

My calorie intake for a day is around 1200-1300 kcal. To be honest, some days it is around 1000-1100. 

My first meal is around 15.00. My last is around 12 am or 1 am.

Looking for a **sanity check from the Porsche brain trust**.

I’m considering a **2020 Porsche Cayenne CPO** with \~52k miles. It already includes the standard **2-year / unlimited-mile Porsche CPO warranty**, which is solid. I asked the dealer about extending coverage and got these numbers:

* **+2 years (total 4 years coverage): $6,453**
* **+4 years (total 6 years coverage): $9,335**

This would be *on top* of the included 2 years.

At first glance, this feels… aggressively Porsche. Before assuming my wallet is being inducted into the Stuttgart Hall of Fame, I wanted to get your thoughts:

**Options I’m weighing:**

1. **Stick with this 2020 CPO** and pay for the extended Porsche warranty
2. **Skip the extension** and roll the dice after the 2-year CPO
3. **Buy a newer model (e.g., 2022)** with lower miles and less warranty anxiety
4. **Buy from CarMax and add MaxCare**, instead of Porsche CPO
5. Some fifth option I haven’t thought of yet (always likely)

**Questions for the group:**

* Are these warranty prices **within the normal ballpark**, or are they on the high side?
* Has anyone successfully **negotiated Porsche CPO extension pricing**?
* How does **CarMax MaxCare** compare in real-world coverage, exclusions, and hassle factor vs Porsche CPO?
* From a cost-of-ownership perspective, is the \~$9k better spent on **newer metal rather than insurance**?

I’m not anti-warranty, but once the number creeps toward five figures, I start wondering if I should just age into a newer Cayenne instead of buying insurance against future *“unexpected German engineering events.”*

Appreciate any firsthand experiences, data points, or “don’t do it” warnings.

Thanks in advance and yes, I know… **Porsche gonna Porsche.**",1,1769127077.0,PorscheCayenne,3,1.0,False

Also looking on WSO seems like I was below average if anything ( [ https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forum/investment-banking/jpm-2025-bonus ](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forum/investment-banking/jpm-2025-bonus) )

I realize everyone is not front office, however that also comes with long hours (60-70hrs a week). So I guess my question to the doom posters would be, if you’re rushing out the door at 4/5pm leaving work unfinished, in fairness to the company why should they give you a pay rise for doing the bare minimum?  I get that people have families etc but ultimately not committing much to work is a lifestyle choice.

Rather than the doom and gloom of the other posts on here, if you’ve received a low bonus in a back office role I would think - am I working long hours eg 60+ hrs a week, \*or\* am I responsible for generating sufficient P&L? If you’re just clocking in your hours and rushing out for the school run after “coffee badging” then does that really merit a pay rise?

Not defending the company but just being honest. As in IB we interact with a lot of back/middle office staff who will ignore an urgent email we send at 5:01pm and not respond to the next day, even when it would take a couple of mins at most. No offence to that person but I can’t imagine Jamie or any other CEO wanting to give them a pay rise or bonus when they do the bare minimum (yes they’re doing a job but that’s what their current pay covers).

Again I don’t mean this in a negative way, but rather if you’re disappointed I would think about how you can either work more hours to get more done, or attach yourself to projects to deliver P&L. Or if you’ve feel you’re genuinely underpaid, move roles to another company?

About two weeks in the high heart rate really started making me anxious (it was getting up to 130 when walking around, again don’t know if anxiety related, and when resting was sitting anywhere between 78-98). Went to GP who immediately told me to pause and get checked. Got an ECG, echo & 24 holter monitor (off the adhd meds). Results came back, echo fine, structure and rythm all completely normal. But a higher than average heart rate. Cardiologist wasn’t concerned and said I could restart meds if they helped my adhd and come back in 2 weeks for another holter whilst on them just for peace of mind. 

I restarted taking them yesterday and already the heart and anxiety is increasing. It’s so annoying as I genuinely do feel they help me. Like my mind feels quieter and I mentally feel calmer. But physically the heart rate just makes me so anxious. I can’t stop monitoring it either. I can sit down and it’ll be like 70s/80s but right after my shower it was almost 140.

1qkbab7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qkbab7/water_question_in_regards_to_my_ro_for_coffee/,Water question in regards to my RO for coffee..,"Hello everyone,

I’ve been using Third Wave Water with my espresso machine for a while now and have been happy with the results. Recently, I installed a Cloud RO system that re-adds minerals in the final stage to produce slightly alkaline water, and I’m trying to figure out the best approach moving forward..especially as I get into filter coffee.

Here’s what my water looks like now:

* Tap water: \~170 ppm
* After RO filtration: \~6 ppm
* After remineralization: \~17–20 ppm

Cloud RO states that the minerals added back include magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc, calcium, and trace minerals.

My main question is whether it would make sense to use TWW packets with this RO water to raise the TDS to around 50–80 ppm for filter coffee. Since filter coffee uses much more water than espresso, going through distilled water bottles could add up quickly, so I’m wondering if this setup could still benefit from TWW.

I know TWW is designed specifically for distilled water, but I’d love to hear your thoughts on whether it could still be useful in my case, especially for filter coffee.

I’m very new to filter coffee (coming strictly from espresso), and while my brews don’t taste bad with good quality beans, I’m curious if changing my water chemistry could noticeably improve things.

Appreciate any insight or suggestions you’re willing to share. Thanks!",1,1769126824.0,pourover,2,0.67,False

I am a brand-new resident of San Diego who has been in the sub for over a year now, asking for recs and discovering all the great food SD has to offer as my partner and I were long-distance (now together, yay!).  You all have made so many awesome recommendations, I wanted to come back and give you my year-end thoughts on the places we’ve eaten within the last 14-ish months, just for fun. A few things: 1. I use em dashes and I am not AI. This was written by me, by hand. I hate that I have to say that. 2. There are some hot takes in here, and people will be offended. Sorry! I’m just a person on the internet. If you disagree, you’re entitled. But like, who cares what I think? 3. These ratings are not scientific, but I had a loosey-goosey method. Not all “As” are the same. One place might be super high-end and get an “A,” and another super casual and get an “A.” I rated them by comparing them to other establishments of the same kind, rather than others on this list (Paris Express is an A for a sandwich place, and Et Voila is a B for a sophisticated dinner spot, but I wasn’t comparing them to each other when rating them, I was comparing them to others of their kind). Makes sense? No? Oh, well! Starting with favorites at the top:

\[Rare Society\] ([https://raresociety.com](https://raresociety.com)): A+++. Triple-plus?? I know. I had to make a new category just for this restaurant. Hands down the best food experience we’ve had in San Diego, and perhaps ever. The service was exceptionally outstanding. The manager was so incredibly kind, warm and friendly. As he seated me, he asked about the occasion and I said it was a date, but a make-up date for a bad experience we had at \[Cowboy Star\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSanDiego/comments/1oy8g82/cowboy\_star\_disappointmentdid\_they\_just\_have\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSanDiego/comments/1oy8g82/cowboy_star_disappointmentdid_they_just_have_a/)) (see below). He checked in with us throughout the entire meal, genuinely interested in what we thought of the food, eager to hear what we had to say about it. Our waiter, Matt, was so warm and genuine I joked that I wanted to be friends with him. Between the two of them, it felt almost like being at a really, really fancy friend’s house. They both cared so much, and their care and concern for our happiness really came through at every step. The food was absolutely outstanding. We ordered the hamachi crudo with red curry aioli and pickled pineapple, the parker house rolls with truffle butter, the blue crab dip with toasted baguette, the “Associate” steak platter that came with a wagyu Denver steak, a wagyu tri-tip, and filet mignon and we added an additional bullseye ribeye as well. The presentation was stunning, all sliced on a gorgeous wooden platter with some bone marrow, whipped garlic tallow butter, bernaise, steak sauce, and Santa Maria salsa. Warm plates were brought to our table before the steak came out, a nice touch. My partner practically wept at the first bite of wagyu tri-tip. Their steaks are all cooked over red oak fire, with heavily seasoned crust. Again, the flavor of everything was just unmatched, cooked perfectly, meltingly tender. For sides, we ordered the asparagus with xo mayonnaise, spring onion vinaigrette and crunchy garlic and the miso glazed carrots with peanut, garlic crunch and mint. We took one bite and agreed it was the best carrot and the best asparagus we had ever eaten. I know I sound hyperbolic, but I can’t talk to up enough. Dessert was creme brûlée for my partner (his favorite) and I had a mind-blowing bananas Foster cheesecake with vanilla bean ice cream. The crust and salted caramel sauce were generous with the salt which contrasted beautifully with the sweet ice cream and tart cheesecake filling. Cocktails were also creative and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant and will be going back soon. It was a perfect meal.

\[TJ Oyster Bar\]([https://www.tjoyster.com/location/4410-bonita-rd](https://www.tjoyster.com/location/4410-bonita-rd)): A++. This is my current favorite restaurant, and we go often. Often enough that I am attempting to try everything on the menu (don't know if this will really happen, as I have many favorites). Where do I begin? The ceviche tostada is superb, as is the aguachile. The ahi tuna tostada is also wonderful. My current go-to is the campechana cocktail and the “fish achiote” appetizer which they say isn’t very popular but is spectacularly flavorful, a hidden menu gem and must-try. Must-haves every single time are the smoked tuna taco (this is wild, it tastes like crumbled bacon), and a few garlic shrimp tacos. They also have wonderful margaritas. The original location on Bonita has the best atmosphere. I cannot recommend this place more. We will never stop returning.

\[Sushi Tadokoro\]([https://sushitadokoro.com](https://sushitadokoro.com)): A++. This omakase place in a humble location was one of the best food experiences we’ve had in San Diego. Their edo-mae style sushi was otherworldly. We sat at the counter, and the service from the chefs was entrancing, magical and so beautiful. Every detail was carefully attended to, from getting to select our own sake cups from a rainbow medley, to a special birthday dessert they presented me with. We still talk about the cod with ginger that melted in our mouths, the sashimi so fresh the shrimp antennae were still moving when served, the incredible oceanic depth of flavor of the clear soup broth. We had many mouthfuls that made us sigh in ecstasy. This is a special occasion experience for someone you really love. They deserved their Michelin star.

\[Born and Raised\]([https://bornandraisedsteak.com](https://bornandraisedsteak.com)): A++. We visited Born and Raised for my partner’s birthday. The short of it: we were absolutely blown away. The atmosphere is beyond. If you’ve been, you know. It’s a sumptuous, decidedly 1970s vibe that is dark, moody and sexy— a perfect special occasion date night atmosphere. We sat in the bar area for a few minutes while we waited for our table. The cocktails were outstanding. The service was thoughtful down to the last detail. My partner asked if they had a specific bourbon, and when the waiter returned he apologized that they were unfortunately out of it, but brought a flight of other similar ones for him to try at no charge. Partner ordered a tomahawk steak which is priced by the ounce, and they kindly brought out some examples of what a small, medium or large would look like, and he chose one on the larger end. My partner is a big meat eater, cooks an excellent steak at home, and isn’t easily impressed by steaks he could have made himself. The presentation of the steak was gorgeous. It was served on a beautiful cutting board, already sliced for easy eating but with the bone prominently displayed, striking! It was served with some lovely salt (it was special, I can’t remember why though!) he really loved as well. This steak had him closing his eyes and nodding his head in the “oh yeah, this is amazing” way. I asked him to explain why it was so good, and he said the aging really added exceptional flavor, the texture was marvelous, it was cooked perfectly, and that it was just head and shoulders above other steaks he’s gotten elsewhere. I had a simple filet and thought it was superb. Sauces were excellent, sides were great, and they brought him a complimentary dessert, as well as a birthday card that the server had drawn a little balloon in, adorable! All in all, B&R was outstanding, and I have no idea where the hell the haters get off. Happily, more room for us!

\[Youngblood\]([https://www.youngbloodsucks.com](https://www.youngbloodsucks.com)): A++. Youngblood is a speakeasy inside the Neighborhood restaurant. More than just a bar, it’s an experience. For \~$85 per person (I actually forgot the exact amount, sorry), you get an hour and half personalized experience of three custom-made cocktails. The bartender chats with you, asks you questions about what you like to drink, eat, what you’re in the mood for and creates works of art that are totally unique. I honestly don’t have enough good things to say about our evening there, and it truly was an artistic experience. We were greeted with a little champagne, and then the cocktails started. As we went a year ago and the night ended in my significant drunkenness, I honestly cannot recall precisely what I asked for or got, except that each drink was truly remarkable, not just creative and well-crafted, but thoughtful and precisely what we wanted. For the dessert “course,” my partner said that he doesn’t normally love dessert, but if he had to choose, his favorite dessert is creme brûlée. The bartender made the most incredible creamy, vanilla nightcap with a perfectly brûléed top, a creme brûlée in a glass. He adored it. It was magical. Also, the atmosphere: it felt like being in a Wes Anderson film, in the best way. Beautiful, weird, charming, with retro details (also, check out the rug!) I am an extreme lightweight, so next time I will ask for one of my three drinks to be non-alcoholic, but I stumbled out of there with socks fully blown off.

\[Don Pancho’s\]([https://www.donpanchosmexfood.com](https://www.donpanchosmexfood.com)): A+. This rating is based on literally only one item: their surf and turf burrito. I have only ever had that, and I will only ever get that. It is the only burrito I want, and I want it every single day. I want it right now, and I am in fact mad that I do not have it right now. My partner keeps saying I should try Clayton’s to compare, but what is there to compare? I cannot love any burrito as much as I love this burrito and I don’t even want to try.

\[Nobu\]([https://www.noburestaurants.com/sandiego/home](https://www.noburestaurants.com/sandiego/home)): A+. Partner took me to Nobu for my birthday and it was honestly amazing. The food was stunning, the service excellent. I had a truly wonderful time except I accidentally REALLY over ate, waddled to the car in abject misery and spent the drive home with an open window, closed eyes, willing myself not to barf. While I will forever remember my birthday dinner with some pain, it wasn’t Nobu’s fault (at least, not entirely). It’s hyped, and I thought it lived up to it. Would definitely return.

\[An’s Dry Cleaning\]([https://adcgelato.com](https://adcgelato.com)): A+. Middle of the day on a Friday, we get in the ridiculous line. I turn to my partner and say “every time I see a line for a restaurant that is down the street, I think ’look at those idiots’ and now here I am, one of the idiots. What the hell are we doing? There is no way this place is worth it.” Then we waited for about 15 minutes. What could possibly be taking so long?! Someone came out with a little sample for us to try that was really delicious, and we finally made it inside whereupon I discovered why it was taking so long. Their method actually ensures the line goes as quickly as possible because everyone in line gets a very quick run-down of the flavors (about 6 total) and you get to taste them all before ordering. I thought this was a brilliant way to cut down on the typical, people-standing-around-staring-for-10-minutes-going-“ummmmmcoulditrythe….” (I’m looking at you, Salt+Straw). I really enjoyed all the flavors, but there was one that tasted like Cherry Garcia that really knocked our socks off. I walked out of there going “Ok, I get it. Definitely worth it.”

\[Paris Express Banh Mi\]([https://www.banhmipx.com](https://www.banhmipx.com)): A+ Talk about value, my goodness. There is probably nowhere else I can get a sandwich longer than my forearm for $8, and on delicious crusty baguette. Best value, very tasty. My new go-to for bahn mi.

\[Sidecar Donuts\]([https://sidecardoughnuts.com](https://sidecardoughnuts.com)): A+. I love them. I don’t know what else to say, except that I am actually in love with their glazed old fashioned. Its glistening, nutmeggy goodness is simple perfection, and their coffee is really good too. Usually I’m a cream and sugar person, but I love theirs black. I also enjoyed their seasonal banana bread latte. Side note: my partner is mad that this isn’t in the A++ category. Sorry, dear!

\[Azuki Sushi\]([https://azukisushi.com](https://azukisushi.com)): A. This place has truly exceptional fish. I’ve been wanting to go back all year but we haven’t made it yet. I accidentally made a reservation for outdoor seating, and I was really irritated at myself for that because inside seating would have been much nicer. That said, it was great. We enjoyed a large spread of nigiri which is all I need, frankly. Will absolutely return.

Izola: A. Beautiful sourdough. Gorgeous croissants. Wonderful coffee. Wild prices. Overall, beautiful bakery.

\[Quixote\]([https://quixotemezcal.com](https://quixotemezcal.com)): A. We dropped in for dinner before seeing a show at \[Lou Lou’s Jungle Lounge\]([https://www.loulousclub.com](https://www.loulousclub.com)), both located in the stunning \[Lafayette Hotel\]([https://lafayettehotelsd.com](https://lafayettehotelsd.com)), and had a light dinner and drinks. Atmosphere: off the charts. This place was essentially made from a decommissioned Catholic church which I believe was brought in piece-by-piece from Mexico, with the altar piece (with tabernacle!) serving as the back bar. There was a moment the ex-Catholic in me thought “is this sacrilegious?” To which I responded immediately 1. No, there are no sacramentals there, the church was decommissioned and was going to be knocked down anyway and 2. I am not Catholic (nor Christian) anymore so I do not care. The church’s architectural details with added gothic chairs and copious drippy candles make it feel both cozy and slightly Dracula-esque, and I adored it. Food was just wonderful. We had chips and guacamole, the crab corn donut (scrumptious), the bay scallop black cocktail (similar to ceviche in flavor, delicious), and some wonderful mole dish that I cannot for the life of me remember because my partner ate all of it as I was too focused on the other things (edit: he says it was a duck confit mole). Cocktails were lovely. Really nice experience, we will return.

\[Galu Cafe\]([https://www.instagram.com/galu\_cafe/](https://www.instagram.com/galu_cafe/)): A. Really cute little place on 3rd in CV. I had their black sesame latte and it was scrumptious. Everything I like in a little independent cafe. When I’m in the area, I will absolutely go back!

\[La Concha\]([https://www.laconchabakery.com](https://www.laconchabakery.com)): A. What is there not to love? Gorgeous spread of Mexican pastries. I want “one of everything, two of everything” (please tell me someone recognizes this \[Homestar Runner\]([https://youtu.be/jPno9bR\_Bo4?si=ShcF5CZSxnN8B00K&t=77](https://youtu.be/jPno9bR_Bo4?si=ShcF5CZSxnN8B00K&t=77)) deep cut). Marvelous and lovely and perfect.

\[Taqueria El Prieto\]([https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-by-el-prieto-chula-vista?start=20](https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-by-el-prieto-chula-vista?start=20)): A-. I am really sad the original location has closed. I am grateful that the second location in Otay Ranch is only 5 minutes from my house. While I love all their tacos and they are very generous with their meats, the adobabda is a flavor bomb of epic proportions, and smothered in creamy, sweet pineapple cilantro sauce. It’s what keeps us going back again and again. Really sweet employees/owner as well. Last we went they didn’t have the aqua frescas we love at the other location, but they told us they are planning to have them soon.

\[Neighborhood\]([https://neighborhoodsd.com](https://neighborhoodsd.com)): A-. Ok, so, I’m going to be honest. We ate here after an experience at Youngblood and by the time we were seated I was honest-to-goodness, weepy drunk. I remember having the short rib and really loving it, but take it with a grain of salt because I wasn’t really in my right mind. That said, I can say that I believed it was quite delicious and the atmosphere was loud, busy, and fun. Service was kind and accommodating.

\[The Balboa South\]([https://thebalboasouth.com](https://thebalboasouth.com)): A-. Partner and I moseyed over after several tiki drinks down the street at Lime in the Coconut, and I was in my cups. It was a Friday night and the place was packed, however, we somehow managed to get the last two seats at the bar and ordered burgers. Absolutely delicious, and I get the hype. Fun, loud, good food for a good price. Would return.

\[De Cabeza El Unico\]([https://decabezaelunico.com](https://decabezaelunico.com)): A-. Stopped in for the first time recently and had a delightful time. Jesus, the owner, was really sweet and friendly. Food was excellent. Neither of us got tacos which I think was a mistake only because I’d love to try their tacos, but the food was delicious, high-quality, and well-made. Will definitely be returning soon for tacos!

\[Teriyaki Grill\]([https://www.teriyakigrillsd.com](https://www.teriyakigrillsd.com)): A-. Reddit recommended this humble and somewhat understated place, specifically the “Steve’s steak sandwich.” Damn! You were right, Reddit! I still think about that sandwich. That’s the only thing I had there so I can’t speak to the rest of the menu, but for a casual bite, it hit the spot. Will be returning.

\[JJs Island Grindz\]([https://jjsislandgrindzca.com](https://jjsislandgrindzca.com)): A-. A really lovely place. I’d never had Guamanian food before, so I got the chicken kelaguen bowl, with a side of their Grandma’s macaroni salad. Lovely and delicious. When I’m next in Bonita, I’ll go again.

\[Hawiian Fresh Seafood\]([https://www.hawaiianfreshseafood.com](https://www.hawaiianfreshseafood.com)): A-. So, here’s the thing about the popularity of poke that drives me utterly bonkers. Somehow on the mainland “poke” has come to mean “raw chopped up, unseasoned fish in a bowl with all kinds of toppings up to and including corn and carrots.” Poke is a marinated fish salad. It’s fish that has already been seasoned with, usually, sesame oil, soy sauce, onions and other things. Poke isn’t a bowl of stuff. It’s the fish. It’s not plain raw fish, it’s a fish salad that is already seasoned. THAT’S the poke. To me, all the places that do “poke” that don’t actually serve poke but instead serve scoops of plain raw fish with various vegetables that you then drizzle stuff on…that’s a raw fish salad bar. Sometimes it’s tasty! I’ll eat it. But poke it is not. In my judgmental little heart, it’s like putting ketchup on egg noodles and calling it spaghetti. Sure I’ll eat it, but let’s not call it poke. I will die on this hill. Hawiian Fresh Seafood serves POKE. Actual poke like you’d get in Hawaii, the right way. It’s delicious, it’s quality, and they are my favorite place to eat lunch in Liberty Station. Highly recommend!

\[Fortunate Son\]([https://www.fortunatesonchinese.com](https://www.fortunatesonchinese.com)): B+. Partner and I came for a cute date night, and honestly, it was great! Here’s the thing about Fortunate Son that some other Redditor pointed out and I am shamelessly copying here: this is Panda Express in a fancy atmosphere BUT I LIKE PANDA EXPRESS. Do I go to Panda Express because I am looking for authentic regional Chinese specialties? No. I go because its fun, cheap, and it tastes good for what it is. And here’s the thing that will ensure I return: it’s way more reasonably priced than any of the Chinese places near our house where we get takeout, and I wouldn’t actually go to any of them on a date night because “atmosphere” is not to be found. The interior of FS is just spectacular, a somewhat kitchy-retro vibe that bathed us in a lovely red glow and ensured we gazed into each other’s eyes and spent an hour in deep, meaningful conversation, over dumplings. Highly recommend the shrimp and pork dumplings, the honey walnut shrimp and the sweet chili oyster mushrooms. The chow mein was bland, but we solved that by pouring the mushroom sauce over it. A downside was that they only serve beer and wine, however, we plan to pre- or post-game at Polite Provisions next door next time. All in all, it doesn’t deserve great accolades, nor does it deserve hate. It’s a cute, inexpensive date spot that made for a fun time.

\[Sushiya in Otay Ranch\]([https://www.sushiyaotayranch.com](https://www.sushiyaotayranch.com)): B+. This is our go-to to-go sushi spot as it’s consistently tasty and very close to home. They have never disappointed and they apparently offer discounts on certain rolls if you’re getting them to-go. Solid!

\[The Wise Ox\]([https://www.thewiseoxsd.com](https://www.thewiseoxsd.com)): B. I got their smoked bologna sandwich and honestly, I only ate half of it because it was so incredibly rich AND served on a brioche-type bun, but it was full of delicious bologna goodness with the bologna sliced really thin and layered, as it should be. Beef-fat fries were wonderful. Partner got their cheesesteak but felt it was just ok- wasn’t overly flavorful, kinda dry.

\[Et Voila French Bistro\]([https://etvoilabistro.com](https://etvoilabistro.com)): B. We had a lovely time. The atmosphere was beautiful, the service was superb. Our favorite bite was probably the French onion soup, which we are very partial to. We also put in an order for the souffle for dessert (Grand Mariner was the flavor of the evening) and it was marvelous. Cocktails were outstanding- partner says the cocktails were exceptionally superb, he had one with huckleberry in it, and it was very balanced and beautifully crafted. I had the coquilles St. Jacque, which were delicious. The only thing we were disappointed in was the “boeuf bourguignon traditionnel” which was not nearly as flavorful as I’ve had elsewhere, with very thin juices served over papperdelle pasta that felt too thick and al dente, and added to the blandness of the whole dish. We would return to try something else, though.

\[Poki One N Half, Mesa Blvd\]([https://www.onenhalf.com](https://www.onenhalf.com)): C+. This is a raw fish salad bar. See my commentary above under “Hawiian Fresh Seafood.” I’ll eat it, it’s fresh, and portions are generous, but it’s not poke. I’ll die on this hill.

\[Underbelly\]([https://godblessunderbelly.com](https://godblessunderbelly.com)): C+. It’s a neat spot in Little Italy. The service was very good. The food was fine. It leaned ever-so-slightly to the bland side, and there is only one option for broth (tonkatsu, aside from the veg option). I prefer a shoyu broth to tonkatsu, but it tasted pretty good. The pork belly bao with hoisin and pickled mustard seeds was yummy. The eggplant bao with pickled green mango was fine, but got soggy quickly (the pork belly bad got soggy fast as well). Beef gyoza were tasty. Indoor seating is very limited and really designed for singles or couples, so as there were four of us we ate outside. It was the perfect day for it, but would have been uncomfortable in chillier weather. All in all, nothing was wrong with it, we enjoyed our meal, but for me it wouldn’t be worth a return trek to Little Italy.

\[Phuong Trang in Convoy\]([https://phuongtrangrestaurant.com](https://phuongtrangrestaurant.com)): C. Ok, this is possibly our error, but…I don’t know. We’ve been twice now and the first time we did pho. It was fine! Nice. Not exceptional, not bad. Perfectly fine. The second time we went I got pho and my partner, most unfortunately, ordered a crispy noodle dish that we thought was going to be like pan-fried noodles, but was in fact 100% unseasoned, completely flavorless bok choy and mushrooms upon which had been placed a puck of completely dry, crunchy noodles that were indistinguishable from a puck of uncooked instant ramen noodles. For some reason, he insisted on powering through and eating it, but we couldn’t believe that that was a meal any sane person would eat (I have pointed out that he actually ate it, sooooo…). It was so bizarre. We saw so much really lovely food being served so we know we just didn’t order well, but honestly, there shouldn’t be anything so bad on a menu that you need to actively avoid it. Unfortunately, we won’t be going back.

\[Lime and the Coconut on 3rd in Chula Vista\]([https://www.limexcoconut.com](https://www.limexcoconut.com)): C. Drinks were really tasty, service and atmosphere was just ok. We came on the early side. We had a nice time, but didn’t really love the people we were sitting near (not the fault of the establishment), the service was fine but not exceptional, and the space just felt kind of vacuous. I might go again if we find ourselves over there, but it’s not a destination for me.

\[Cowboy Star\]([https://www.cowboystar.com](https://www.cowboystar.com)): C-. See my \[recent experience of this place\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSanDiego/comments/1oy8g82/cowboy\_star\_disappointmentdid\_they\_just\_have\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSanDiego/comments/1oy8g82/cowboy_star_disappointmentdid_they_just_have_a/)) I appreciated everyone’s thoughts and comments, and here’s my takeaway: this place is thoroughly mid, and it’s overhyped by this sub which has created a cult-like obsession with it, in a way that many people (like me) can’t wrap their heads around. My experience was \*not\* unique, it was clearly \*not\* a one-off bad night, and us haters have to just be quiet about it because we’ll get downvoted to oblivion. But here I am, Reddit, and I am ready to shout my truth from the rooftops and to hell with the downvotes: COWBOY STAR IS NOT GOOD, ACTUALLY. The nerve of some people to shit on Born and Raised while trying to tell me that this glorified hotel-buffet food, terrible cocktails, dull steak knives, unseasoned meat, overcooked vegetables, and blah experience, is somehow better? Are you all ok? The number of people in that thread who quite literally said, “if you can cook a good steak at home, you aren’t going to find a steakhouse that does it better, steakhouses are for the sides, cocktails and service.” I’m sorry, WHAT?! So, you’ve never eaten exceptional steak at a good steakhouse then, period. Truly a wild statement, and admission that indeed, you’ve only ever eaten mid steaks. Honestly, there was more flavor in the first bite of food at Rare Society than there was in the entire meal at Cowboy Star, and I am not exaggerating at all, the steaks at CS were essentially unseasoned! Look, everyone is entitled to their wrong opinions. I’m just some random asshole on the internet, who cares what I think? But since you are here reading my dumb reviews, that’s what I have to say about it. Cowboy Star is not good, and I will not be returning, so suck on that, San Diego! Additionally, an unscientific review of their Yelp reviews of the last several months show a noticeable uptick in 2 and 1 star reviews. I wonder if internal changes were made that lead to this? No idea, but not sticking around to find out if they improve. Rare Society blows this place out of the water, and so does Born and Raised. Save your money and get a good meal elsewhere.

\[iSushi Otay Ranch\]([http://www.isushirestaurant.com](http://www.isushirestaurant.com)): D-. We dropped in here for…reasons…I honestly have no idea why. It was exactly what I should have expected of a relatively no-name, strip mall sushi spot. Menu was not accurate, TONS of flies that would not stop bothering us, poor quality food, undercooked rice, dirty cups. I’m not giving it an F because I didn’t actually see a rat.

1qkb8jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qkb8jg/aitah_for_not_confirming_a_date/,AITAH for not confirming a date?,"I (35M) matched with a woman (38F) on hinge and after some messages we agreed to meet for coffee. She is a postdoc student and had finals coming up so we agreed on a day/time about a week and a half out. After a few days I send her another message to check in and ask how her week is going. She let me know she was busy with finals but for the most part was doing well. We small talked about the weather and before the conversation kinda came to a natural end (this conversation took place on Wednesday with our date scheduled for Sunday). The morning of I sent a message letting her know I was leaving and would see her soon. I arrive on time and as I'm walking into the coffee shop I get a message back that since we didn't talk she assumed the date was off and was still in bed. 

This totally threw me off as we had agreed to the date and neither of us reached out to cancel. I knew she was busy so I gave her some space, but regardless, I'm not the kind of person to constantly text someone back and forth, especially if we've never met in person. It felt like she was justifying standing me up for not confirming. I mean, in my mind, if she was uncertain about whether or not we were still going to meet, she could have reached out and asked instead of just assuming the date was off. If she wasn't interested in meeting she also could have cancelled out of respect for my time.

The nickname is rough, but useful. Sure, her henchmen can’t function without adult supervision. Sure, her stepdaughter, Snow White, spurns every attempt at mentorship. Still, by all reasonable measures, the queendom is thriving.

But the dominoes start toppling quickly when Snow White steals the Queen’s enchanted mirror, the one tool she relies on to know what’s true, escalating from “family issues” to “national crisis”.

Determined not to overreact, the Queen sends in her top operatives. Unfortunately, that’s Captain Hook—a bombastic, impulsive catastrophe—and the Huntsman, a highly skilled professional currently paralyzed by an existential crisis. Instantly forced to step in herself, the Queen sets off with her henchmen on a prophesied quest down the Yellow Brick Road, attempting, unsuccessfully, not to micromanage. What should be a routine mission, quickly devolves, leaving the Queen without her mirror, without answers, and quietly questioning how much control she ever had. By the time they return home, Snow White is on the throne, the city is surrounded by flying crocodiles, and the Queen’s authority, and her identity as a capable ruler, is publicly dismantled.

As break-ins turn into breakouts and plans unravel faster than she can revise them, the Queen realizes Snow White may not be the real threat. Digging for answers the only way she knows how—with a gallon of coffee and a library card—she uncovers the truth: Brian. A smug, disturbingly competent blond financier who has weaponized money, bureaucracy, and spreadsheets, to quietly strip her thriving queendom for parts.

To save her kingdom, and buck the stereotypes she’s been typecast in all her life, the Evil Queen must do the unthinkable: form an uneasy alliance with her teenage stepdaughter. Because reclaiming power is one thing. Reclaiming your legacy is another.

Shes a chronic liar. I'll start with my mom being pregnant at 19 and her alcoholic, racist, mother telling her to either abort the baby or get out of her house. My mom chose to get out but my sisters biological dad wanted nothing to do with her, so for the most part she was alone. She had a few family members but not that many. She did have to drop out of college though. By the time my sister was 8, she met my dad, he raised my sister from then, and after a year they got married. I only found out about 2 years ago we dont have the same dad, thats how close we all were. My mom was pregnant with me during her wedding, but she didn't know at the time. It's important to note that growing up my moms mom treated me differently because I'm half Cuban, my dad being full, and again, shes racist. My mom didn't want us going to the schools by us being they're not the best, so she enrolled us at schools near by where her mom lived and put her address on our paperwork. One day when my sister was in school, I think a junior at the time, she had an argument with her then bf and she threatened to kill herself. He reached out to my mom and my mom tried to get her help but my sister got upset. She decided to stay with our grandmother without telling our mom, and our grandmother also didn't tell my mom. My mom asked her if she'd seen my sister and she said she was with her. My mom got mad and the next morning she went to pick my sister up. They had a fight and my grandmother was pissed. She called our schools to let them know we were actually an hour away from where the schools were, got rid of everything we owned at her house, called people to come see for themselves that we didn't live there, and got us kicked out of school. I was in 4th grade at the time and was forced to go to the schools by me. We cut her off and hadn't spoke to her since. Fast forward to October 2022, my dad had a heart attack in his sleep and died. My sister was doing college online at home wasting the money my mom spent to send her out if state even though she had scholarships in our state, because she decided to come home about a year earlier. Using an expensive laptop my mom bought that she claimed she was using for architecture, because it was designed with a program used for it, but she only ever gamed with it. A little while after my mom gets a  call from a family member saying that my sisters car is parked outside of the college her current bf went to when she was supposed to be at work. My mom calls my sisters place of work and they inform her that she doesn't work there, that 2 years ago she was rejected and my moms fuming. It's iportant to note that my sister had an Audi which is about $100 to fill up her tank, and my parents were paying her gas. Where we live was the same distance from where my mom worked and where my sister said she worked. And my dad even expressed concern to my mom that something was wrong but she brushed it off. My mom got into the habit of laying out my sisters pills and making her a coffee every morning, but after that she stopped. She confronted my sister, who was 20 at the time, and my sister refused to answer. She got upset about not having her meds and coffee so she decided to move out. She moved in with her bf AT COLLEGE. He got kicked out for failing and because they found out she was living there. They move into her bfs parents home shortly after. My sister tells our granny(our moms, dads, wife.) that her and her bf are going to get eloped. Two college dropouts mind you. And my granny messages my sisters bfs mom. We'll say his name is Karl, she messages Karl's mom basically. She's confused because apparently my sister told her she was an orphan because she didn't want to get a job. Which is weird because 1, by law she's too old to be an orphan, and 2 her biological dad is still alive. She confronts my sister and she decides to double down and tell Karl's mom that my mom abused her. Where? Where's the abuse. And my granny shut her shit down, she told Karl's mom the truth because she wasn't having it. She kicked my sister out and now she's living with our moms racist mom, the one who told my mom to abort her. My sister also made a fb repost August 2024, which says ""I unfriend, uncousin, unauntie so quick, ask my ex sister. Clearly a jab at me. People were messaging her, telling her how wrong it was to attack me, because her and I have never spoken about the whole situation, no arguments, no mention of it, nothing. So why was I dragged into it? Sure, I definitely don't agree with the things she's done, but I never talked about it with anyone up until that point. I didn't message her to confront her about it, because I honestly have better things to worry about than that. But then I found out she called me spoiled. I don't remember where I heard it from or who she told but I'd like to mention that I have to work hard for what I want unlike her who was handed everything. I have to rely on scholarships because my mom can't afford to pay for college, which shouldn't be an issue for me. It's not an issue because I'm a straight A student with at most 1 B, I maintain a 4.0 and sometimes higher, I'm part of my schools Honor Society, which is for academic achievers and community service helpers, Beta Club, which is about community service, A club dedicated to people who passed the English Leap, and book club. I do occasionally slack off, but very clearly I do a lot to be a good student and have my future go smoothly. I'll be the first between Me, my sister, and my parents to actually finish college, ik that for a fact. And I think thats honestly a really good accomplishment, even if I haven't started college yet, I don't plan on backing down. My sister messaged me on fb in August 2024, which was actually before she reposted the post on fb, which she reposted September of that same year, to tell me she loves me and she assumed that I didn't want her in my life because I never responded to her. Mind you, the ONLY text from her I haven't responded to was sent to em 10 minutes before she messaged me on fb. She texted me my name with a question mark. I was busy and didn't see it. God forbid 10 minutes went by without her being acknowledged. She blocked me on fb shortly after. Lovely. She's burnt almost every bridge in our family. Her bfs parents hate her, not to mention her slapping Karl's little brother, who's younger than me. I have no idea why, I just know that it happened. Our cousins don't speak to her, aunts, uncles, literally no one. The only people she has are her bf, my moms racist mother, and her weird husband. To end the story, a cop knocked on our door a few days ago while my mom was at work. He left a card and when my mom called he said he was there to serve my sister. Basically she's being sued, but we don't know specifics. She informed him that my sister hasn't lived here for 3 years and the call ended there. She told him to come back when she was off of work, so I'm still waiting for what he has to say.",1,1769126692.0,u_SavingsGate9398,0,1.0,False

* Exclusive use of the function room for four hours
* Food, buffet or plated menu
* Refreshing iced tea for all guests
* One round of coffee or tea
* Basic sound system and sophisticated lighting
* Standardized menu cards or buffet tags
* Upgradable styling options and fresh floral arrangements for the guest tables, registration table, buffet tables, and niche areas
* A dedicated banquet team
* Complimentary parking

We have a friend who held their reception at Stalla Suites in QC, and their package was around ₱130–150k, pero nasa 100+ naman ang guests. So I'm not sure why, but Vivere's pricing feels a bit over the top in comparison. Although, I'd like to admit, gusto ko talaga yung vibes, and kaya naman ng budget.

**So my questions are:**

1. Do you guys know other hotels that could accommodate our intimate gathering? (We really prefer hotels.)
2. If not a hotel, do you know other events place na maganda na yung mismong lugar and wouldn't need much styling?
3. I'm not sure po kung gusto ko pa mag-hold ng program, but I still want it to feel celebratory. May maa-advise po ba kayong program flow for an intimate gathering? We definitely *do not* want to do the money dance.
4. Ano po kaya ang mga details na need ng venue itself na dapat kong pagtuunan ng pansin? I'm not aiming for magarbo feels—simple but classy, since intimate.

Sobrang maa-appreciate ko po yung mga advice, tips, and recommendations nyo. Thank you so much!",2,1769126239.0,WeddingsPhilippines,0,1.0,False
1qkb1ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reduction/comments/1qkb1ak/trying_to_keep_sane_and_stay_positive/,Trying to keep sane and stay positive,"Hi everyone, as the title reads I am trying to keep sane and stay positive. Yesterday, was very overwhelming and I had several bouts of crying. Basically I had my reduction surgery last month - surgery went great, hospital experience was pretty awful. I literally ran down to the steps to my house once my husband parked the car (no memory of this due to heavy drugs and anesthesia) 

Fast forward to News Year. Brought in the new year at home with Netflix then had sudden massive pain in my lower abdomen. Rushed to ER to discover I had ovarian torsion and bleeding. So now, on the day I was intended to have my Week 6 clearance meeting for my reduction, I will be having serious abdominal surgery, have to stay at the hospital, hope they save my ovary with another 4 weeks recovery. 

Today was a bit better as I saw a friend for coffee but the anesthesiologist made a mistake with my surgery prescription so I will spend tomorrow morning at their pre op clinic trying to sort that out. 

I am just looking for support and tips to stay sane at this point. I am thinking I might use the extra time to brainstorm starting a financial literacy charity. Another idea I had was to create a insta page dedicated to reviewing all the medical stuff I bought for my breast reduction (that actually worked!) and for my next surgery (placed an Amazon order this morning). 

When I think of things like this, I have a balanced mindset but then at night when I'm trying to sleep I just feel sad and scared. 😭

1qkb11m,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1qkb11m/anyone_have_a_place_to_read_jones_heiress_strikes/,Anyone have a place to read Jones heiress strikes back?,"Last time, my husband's secret daughter was diagnosed with acute leukemia. When it came time for a bone marrow transplant, he secretly took her in for the procedure. Her heart gave out mid-surgery. She died on the operating table at just four years old.

By the time I reached the hospital, all that was left for me to hold was my little girl's ice-cold body.

My husband just rolled his eyes at my tears. ""It's not like she was going to make it anyway. If her marrow can help someone else, then good for her. Karma, right? Maybe she'll get a better shot in her next life.""

I wanted to tear his face off.

He shoved me back and kicked me. ""This is your fault, you useless mother! You couldn't even give her a healthy body. You're both cursed!""

That was it. I'd had enough. I grabbed him, and we went out the window—sixteen stories down.

Then I woke up. Back on my engagement day. Right then and there, I called my dad. ""Dad, I'm not marrying Scott. Please switch the business deal to his brother instead.""

Let's see how Scott and that tramp manage without me.

I hung up, my hands still shaking. The memory of my daughter's cold skin was burned into my mind. Sixteen stories… then boom. I was back in the bridal suite.

The party hadn't even started. I pulled myself together, snatched my dress, and got out of that room.

As soon as I stepped into the hall, I heard them.

""Scott, it's your engagement party. This isn't right. Miranda's right next door.""

Scott's voice was rough, post-sex. ""Relax. She's desperate to marry me. She's probably just sitting in there, waiting all pretty. She can't hear us.""

""And if it weren't for her grandfather pushing this business merger, I wouldn't even look twice at her. Have you seen her? Always acting so high and mighty. It drives me crazy.""

My fists clenched. I wanted to rip him apart.

He wasn't wrong. Our marriage was arranged because our grandfathers wanted it—a business deal, plain and simple. I wasn't in love with him. And last time, I'd just waited quietly in the bridal suite. I never saw this side of him.

Then Miranda's soft, sickly-sweet voice chimed in. ""Scott, don't say that. Her mom died young, and her dad's never around. No one ever taught her how to behave…""

That did it. I kicked the door open.

I was still raw with grief over my daughter, and they had the nerve to bring my mother into this?

They scrambled up from the couch, frantically fixing their clothes.

The second Miranda saw me, her face twisted with anger. ""Chelsea, what the hell! What are you doing here?""

I slapped her hard across the face. ""It's my wedding. What are you doing? Screwing my fiancé on the couch?""

Miranda tried to hit me back, but I caught her wrist. With my other hand, I grabbed a fistful of her hair.

Because of her, my daughter had died on that operating table—just to provide bone marrow for Miranda's child.

But before I could land another blow, Scott kicked me hard in the side.

""Chelsea, have you lost your mind?! You can't hit her! Do you have any idea who she is?""

I crashed backward over the coffee table. Pain shot through my body, and I couldn't get up.

The door swung open, and security guards poured into the room.

Before I could speak, Scott shouted, ""Miranda is a Jones! You know the Jones family? Billionaires!""

Through the haze of pain, I looked at Scott. He was holding Miranda, tenderly inspecting her reddened cheek.

I smirked. ""She's a Jones? Since when did my father have another kid? Scott, care to guess why my last name is Jones?""

Chapter 2

A second later, Miranda is in front of me. She kneels down and slaps me—hard.

""Hold her down! You little bitch, how dare you hit me! So your last name is Jones? Big deal. Plenty of people are named Jones!""

""What are you waiting for? Hold her down! I'm going to teach her what happens when she messes with me.""

The guards grab my shoulders and shove me. The pain shoots through me, and I collapse on the floor.

Scott walks over to Miranda, glaring down at me.

""So your last name is Jones? So what? Miranda and I have been engaged for years. What have you ever done? Sure, you have a little money, but you're nothing compared to Miranda. You should be grateful I'm even willing to marry you.""

""You should've done your homework before acting all high and mighty. Your father might love his wife, but Miranda carries her mother's last name—Williams. Just because you share a last name doesn't make you her, Chelsea. You're so pathetic!""

My mother was killed when I was five. After that, my dad became fiercely protective. Everyone thinks I'm studying abroad. Even Scott didn't know my real identity until after we were married last time, so it's no surprise he's clueless now.

As for taking my mother's last name—that's ridiculous. It's true, my father loved my mom deeply. But he never remarried, and he built his empire. I'm still a Jones.

Miranda crosses her arms and spits on me. She barks at the guards, ""Hold her down.""

She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, running her thumb along the blade as she gives me a vicious look.

""Behave, and you might still get to enjoy the party. Mess with me, and I'll make you regret it.""

I struggle, desperate to buy time. My dad will be here—he's coming to the party. I just have to hold on until he shows up.

I look up at Scott. ""This is our engagement party! What are you going to tell everyone if she hurts me?""

Scott doesn't even glance my way. Instead, he kisses Miranda.

""It's just an announcement. You don't need to be here. I'll handle my grandfather.""

""You should listen to her. Piss off Miranda, and you'll never become my wife.""

He straightens his suit and walks out, locking the door behind him.

Miranda stands over me, the knife hovering near my face.

""You've got a pretty face. What happens if it gets… damaged? How will you seduce anyone then?""

As she speaks, a sharp pain cuts across my cheek. I feel warm blood trickling down, staining my dress.

I try to pull away. ""Miranda, you're going to regret this!""

""Who wants Scott anyway? He's trash. I don't want him—""

Miranda smashes an ashtray against my head. Everything goes fuzzy for a moment.

I can still hear her voice.

""Scott? He does whatever I want. I'll play with him for now, but I'm not marrying him. I'm a Jones. He's just a Scott!""

""Shut her up! Someone stop her talking!""

I can't see what's happening, but something foul is shoved into my mouth.

Miranda kneels down, getting right in my face.

""Which hand did you hit me with? Was it your right one?""

Chapter 3

Miranda smiles, pulling out the knife.

I try to roll away.

""Oh? You can still move?""

The guards pin me down again. The blade sinks into my leg.

""Chelsea, I hate the way you act. I am better than you!""

""And now you're pretending to be a Jones? Just because you share a last name with my father, and your mother died like mine, you think you can be me? I could kill you right now, and no one would even care.""

The pain is so intense I nearly black out, but her words cut through the fog.

""Let her go! I want to see her beg for mercy!""

The guards release me. I drag myself toward the door, leaving a trail of blood behind.

Miranda's laughter echoes behind me.

""Hahahahaha! Chelsea, look at you now!""

I lost my heels at the party. The knife wound in my foot screams with every movement, and soon I can't move at all.

The door bursts open. Someone screams.

""What the hell is going on?!""

I see a figure rushing toward me.

Scott's brother, Andrew.

I don't know much about Andrew—only that he's Scott's brother and the CEO of the company.

Andrew is a workaholic. In my past life, he never married, pouring everything into building the business.

That's exactly why I asked to marry him.

If I have to marry someone, it might as well be Andrew instead of Scott. At least Andrew wouldn't use my daughter to kill someone else.

But for some reason, seeing Andrew now, I feel a strange sense of calm. Then everything goes black.

I wake up in a hospital bed. My face is bandaged, my hands and feet wrapped. My father's assistant, Lee, sits beside me.

""You're awake. You were stabbed, but it missed the bone. You just need rest. As for the cut on your face, I've contacted the best plastic surgeon. We'll make sure there's no scar.""

Lee notices me glancing around.

""They've been taken by the police. Don't worry.""

""Your father is in a meeting, but he'll be here soon. Please call him. He's worried sick.""

He hands me the phone. I can hear the rage in my father's voice.

""Who did this to you?! I won't let them live after touching my daughter.""

Lee said they were arrested, so they'll face consequences.

And since I'm marrying Andrew, I'll soon be the Scott family's daughter-in-law. I don't want to cause too much trouble.

""Lee said everything's been handled. By the way, did you tell them I want to marry Andrew?""

He goes quiet for a moment, still seething.

""I've spoken to their grandfather about the marriage. The engagement party is canceled.""

""As for what happened, don't even think about hiding it from me. I'll find out myself if I have to. They hurt your hands and legs—I'll make sure they pay in kind!""

I want to ask about Miranda, but he hangs up.

Miranda's words keep echoing in my mind: ""I could kill you, and no one would care."" What makes her so sure she can get away with it?

Chapter 4

I wake up to the sound of voices.

At first I think it's my dad, but it's Scott.

He doesn't even look me in the eye before he slaps me across the face.

""Chelsea! What the hell is wrong with you? Why would you send Miranda to the police? Do you have any idea how much her father loves her? Are you trying to get yourself killed?""

The door swings open and Miranda walks in. She's out of jail already? But she's got security guards trailing behind her. And there's a man with her—someone I've seen before.

Before I can even process it, one of the guards swings a baseball bat and hits me. Hard.

I feel blood trickling from my head before everything goes black.

The man steps closer and looks down at me.

""So you're the one bullying my daughter, is that right?""

Then it hits me—I know who he is. He's my dad's driver.

""You're my dad's driver, aren't you? What's going on—""

I'm absolutely furious.

She made me kneel for her—twice!

Scott lets out a cold laugh.

""You know what, Chelsea? The wedding's off. Your dad called my grandfather. The Jones family is marrying into the Scott family now. So you're nothing.""

""Actually, I should thank you. After what you did, Miranda agreed to marry me.""

I spit in his direction.

""You're nobody. The Jones family would never marry someone like you!""

Scott kicks me.

""You're trash! Your own dad's driver is here, and Miranda's standing right there! When will you get it through your thick skull?""

My head is spinning, my vision blurry. But then someone steps in front of me.

I took my test yesterday on the 21st and it took me a little over an hr and a half. I’ll do my best at explaining what’s on there. And for my school the tests required were A&P, Math, Reading comprehension, grammar and vocab. 


Math (96)

I hate math, so I studied quite a bit for this section. I honestly didn’t know what to study going in but after being in this group I focused mainly on mixed fractions a long with regular ones. Know how to add/subtract/multiply and divide!! Know your ratios and percentages! I had quite and bit of those. Some word problems like, the bushel per acre and also the balloons for the party. Those can be found on this quizlet along with the questions that are super similar if you study this quizlet and know how to do it your golden. Also learn your conversions nothing too crazy just know them I have a really good method for the oz to gallons, feel free to ask.

A&P (100)
Know the basics get familiar with that, I was good in a&p I didn’t really have a problem in that class but honestly study this quizlet there’s a good chance it will be the same mine was verbatim to this quizlet!

https://quizlet.com/1069177347/hesi-a2-anatomy-main-flash-cards/?i=5axv7i&x=1jqY

Grammar (84) 
Hated this the most, didn’t study much tbh I just winged it I would definitely study this section because there’s some words in there that I didn’t have a clue what they meant. Some parts are easy though, don’t stress. And a lot of these questions and the vocab are clinical setting questions. I didn’t really find a good quizlet but nurse hub was helpful. I know not everyone can afford it but if you can it will help. 

Vocab (90) 
I enjoyed this section, I thought it was pretty fair and easy. A lot of it was medical related and there was some med term in there as well but very basic. I would study stuff in nurse hub and YouTube, there’s good videos out there that can prepare you. But you’re all smart people and I guarantee you with process of elimination you can answer these. 

Reading comprehension (88) 

Kinda of bummed I didn’t make a 90 or above I felt like I was doing good while taking it but oh well. The passages are short for the most part some are long like the card game one. But I got food and drink, insomnia one, one about the work place environment, Golden Gate Bridge, coffee, and Winter Olympics that’s it I think or at least all I can remember. Read the passage and for the most part they’re pretty straightforward questions and answers. Also the answer is in the passage a lot!

1qkazb2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkazb2,Why I Never Forget What I Studied Anymore?,"This tool solved the **two biggest problems** I faced when I started college: **heavy memorization** and **lack of time**.

I really struggled with memorization. I tried everything you can imagine—taking notes, summarizing, solving lots of questions—but nothing worked for me in the long run except **one method**: **Spaced Repetition**.  
The idea is simple: you review each lesson at **specific, spaced intervals**.

A lot of people know about spaced repetition, but many don’t know how to use it **properly**.

Personally, I had no idea how to consistently review each lecture on its own over time—until I found something genius.

It’s a [Notion template](https://lnk.ua/5V1oBo54d) that one of my classmates recommended, and honestly, I’ve been using it since my first year. It helped me a lot with **memorization** and **time management**.

You can add every lecture you study into a table (each subject has its own table), and the system automatically tells you the **exact days** you should review it. After each review, you just check it off—this way, you’re almost guaranteed **never to forget** what you studied.

And it’s not just about memorization.

The template has a **clean, organized interface** that helps you manage your daily tasks and **track your progress**.  
Each subject has its own page where you can:

* Follow up on your reviews
* See what you’ve already studied
* Know what you still need to study

And of course, everything is **fully customizable**, so you can adjust it exactly the way you like.

So let’s imagine a simple day:

You start your day with a cup of coffee and open Notion.

1. First, you check what you need to review today and quickly start reviewing.
2. After finishing each review, you tick it off.
3. Then you look at your task list, add new tasks and lectures.
4. As you complete each task, you check it off as well.
5. Finally, once you finish a lecture, you add it to the table so the system schedules your future review dates automatically.

That’s it—simple, organized, and effective.

**Good luck to everyone 🤍**

To give a rundown here is what my situation looks like. 

I had a girlfriend, she was my first everything. She told me several months ago that a supervisor at our workplace (a co-supervisor for me) had coerced her into sexual favors. Threatening to make her life hell if she didn’t do what he wanted. When I heard that, I title 9d him. Basically a sexual assault report. After that, I started losing friends. I lost co worker friends, and they trusted him more or liked him more. Then comes a dark meeting. Everyone was airing out beef with others. Then I find out people had problems with me. Of how I wrote a 8-9 page document about why the department I represent is lacking, and ways I think it could be fixed, ways to revamp training. Instead of being met with understanding, I was met with animosity. People said I was on a high horse, I’m immature, and just things I couldn’t get. As I had done something similar for one employee, but all my co supervisors were okay with it. I didn’t understand it. 

So over the months ever since that meeting, j lost more and more and more friends. I felt so helpless and ostracized there I just had to quit. It was my dream job, a supervisor. I always wanted it when I started college, and I finally got it, but I quit. 

I quit December 15th 2025. 

Then a day later, my girlfriend breaks up with me. It was out of nowhere. I had no idea it was coming. Her reasons were fair, but the reasons felt hypocritical. She said I don’t love my self enough, and that I don’t trust her compliments. Essentially, I was too anxious too date. I didn’t believe in her reassurances etc. But she would do the exact same things, she self harmed, she didn’t believe the words of affirmation I gave her, etc. I should’ve seen it coming though, she was being avoidant again a week before she came over to break up. 

After 5 hours of talking, she changed her mind. “You’re my honey” she said. I couldn’t believe it. I wanted her to stay so bad. 

Comes December 17th. I wake up in the morning and she comes over again and we get coffee. Discussing ways for me to love my self more. We came up with solutions, I thought things would eventually go back to normal. Then, she comes back over again in the night. And she breaks up with me again. 

In three days, I lost my friends, my girlfriend, and our mutual friends. 

I lost everything I ever valued. 

She broke up with me two weeks before she was supposed to fly to Chicago and celebrate my birthday with me. We were supposed to watch the fireworks, and go back home and she would bake me a birthday cake. I never got a cake. 

Then on my birthday she texts me, happy birthday, and stay safe. I left a gift for you at your place. I asked her to return it. 

I spent my entire winter break, miserable. I could barely sleep, barely eat. I hated my self more than ever. 

I know everything is my fault. 

Then I fuck up even more. I get back to college, final semester. I get back home and see the gift she left. And I thought sbe blocked my number cause the texts never said delivered. I regret what I texted her, I was so upset in the moment. That I want to anger fuck her and make her do something 10 times. I felt disgusting right after. I was selfish. 

Then later that night, my dad and sister text me. That my ex can’t handle the constant texts from me throughout break. She doesn’t have the heart to block me. But I thought she did, that’s why I kept sending texts, I never knew they delivered. 

I’m reminded every day of how lonely I am. She promised we would be together forever. We’d have kids, married, etc. 

And now my child hood dog is going to be put down in a couple weeks. 

I don’t know what I want to do in my future. I’m supposed to graduate this May with a bachelors of science in psychology. 

I just wanted to help people, protect my love. But instead I ruined my life. I know everything is my fault, I know I rucked up. 

But I can’t take it anymore, I don’t want to live anymore. Sure people would be sad but other than my family who else? I have no friends at college here. I barely have any friends back home.

This product is an app, a caffeine tracker app for people who want to manage and control their caffeine consumption. Most people don’t consider how much they much caffeine they consume whether it’s through coffee or energy drinks. 

The target market for this kind of app is probably the majority of the population worldwide because everybody either drinks coffee or tea or even soda which contain different amounts caffeine. 

Currently there are a few apps that offer similar features as this one, however this is just the beginning, there’s a lot more features and functionalities I’d like to bring to the table. (Currently working on improving the UI and implementing features like daily activity, mental or physical stress and recommended consumption per user. 

This is again a free app and it is for anyone who takes love coffee or energy drinks and can’t live without it which also affects their mood and sleep.

I’m new to app development although I have a solid foundation and knowledge in coding and making websites. 

The app is available on iOS and coming to Android soon.

1qkas03,https://i.redd.it/95zscn8mmzeg1.jpeg,Life rant because I’m really struggling,"Hi my name is Aydan and I’m 14. I need help on understanding some stuff and what I should do.

So I live at home with my mum brother (10) and sister (10) and also my little cousin (6) my dad used to be a huge part of my life but now it feels like he isn’t even part of it anymore. I haven’t seen him since Christmas and before Christmas I didn’t see him since mid year (June). He also breaks a lot of promises too, I was 11 or 12 and we were ment to go to an air show together and I had to wake up at 4:30 so we could beat traffic. I waited at the window for hours all the way until 7am (he was ment to be there at 5-5:30) I texted him over and over but he didn’t respond until 10am he said that he overslept and when I asked him to come over to pick me up he said “sure let me have my coffee first” he then didn’t get to my house till 11:30 and then we finally left. I have just stopped trusting him and I don’t expect him to show up for me anymore. I really want to reconnect with him but I’m afraid he’ll just drift away and I’ll be left with that crushing feeling again.

My nana.

My nana is a heavy smoker and she has just been diagnosed with lung cancer and the news has crushed me beyond belief. I didn’t let anyone see how much it hurt but when I went to bed that night I couldn’t even cry I just sat there staring at the wall I wanted to cry so bad but I couldn’t. She still smokes for some reason even tho I don’t want her to but what do I do I can’t just tell her to stop.

My school life.

I struggle a lot in school I get into fights I really suck at school work and I don’t have the patience to sit in a classroom for 5 hours a day learning stuff I find useless. I believe if I get into enough fights my dad might talk with me but I guess that’s just a pipe dream.

Me.

I won’t ask for help I don’t know why but I just can’t every time I am about to my words just stutter and don’t come out. The weight is starting to get to heavy for my to carry for to long I’ve been dealing with most of this for about 2 years now and it’s soul crushing I act happy and energetic while I’m with friends or with anyone else and they don’t see anything wrong.

How I snapped.

I was playing poker with my brother and sister and I just snapped my brother won a pot then my sister started mocking my brother and me and then when I asked her to leave she started to mock me again. I’ve never ever got this mad at them and I was about to hit her before I stopped my self and stormed out. I know how cringe it sounds but it’s the only thing I could do. I feel like I am a danger to them I can’t really control my emotions anymore and I feel like running away it sounds dramatic but it would stop me from harming them.",9,1769125572.0,teenagers,5,1.0,False
1qkaqul,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Legitimate_Sweet2188/comments/1qkaqul/your_online_reputation_score_is_affecting_your/,Your Online Reputation Score Is Affecting Your Life in Ways You've Never Considered,"There's a number that influences nearly every major opportunity in your life—and you've probably never seen it.

It's not your credit score. It's not your GPA. It's your online reputation score: the cumulative impression created when someone searches your name and scans the results.

Unlike formal scores, this one isn't calculated by any bureau or delivered in any report. It exists in the minds of everyone who Googles you—employers, dates, potential friends, business partners, landlords—and shapes their decisions before you ever meet them.

Most people have no idea what their score looks like. They're being evaluated against information they've never reviewed, by people they'll never know searched them.

Here's why that matters across virtually every dimension of your life.

# Career Opportunities You'll Never Know You Lost

The data here is consistent and sobering.

Studies show that 70% of employers research candidates online during the hiring process. Over half have rejected candidates based on what they found. And here's the critical part: fewer than 10% inform candidates when online findings influenced the decision.

This means most career damage from reputation issues is invisible. You don't get the callback. You don't advance to the final round. The offer goes to someone else. No explanation arrives. You assume the competition was tough or your qualifications fell short.

Meanwhile, the actual reason sits on page one of Google—something you've never seen, influencing decisions you'll never understand.

It's not just hiring. Promotions, partnerships, client relationships, professional referrals—all involve someone typing your name into a search bar and making judgments based on what appears. Your reputation score gates access to opportunities at every career stage.

# Dating and Relationships: The Pre-Screen You Can't Skip

A 2024 Pew Research study found that 67% of people research potential romantic partners online before meeting them. Among younger demographics, that number climbs higher.

Think about what this means. Before you've said a word, made eye contact, or had any chance to make a first impression, your date has already formed opinions based on your Google results. They've decided whether you seem trustworthy, successful, interesting, or concerning.

Negative search results don't just create awkward first-date conversations. They prevent first dates from happening at all. The person who found something concerning simply stops responding to messages. You experience ghosting without understanding why.

Even established relationships aren't immune. New partners research each other. Their friends and family research you. In-laws Google their children's significant others. Your reputation score circulates through relationship networks without your knowledge or participation.

# Friendships and Social Circles

Adults make fewer new friends than they did in earlier life stages—and when they do, those connections often involve some form of digital vetting.

Meeting someone at a party, through mutual friends, or at a community event increasingly leads to a quick search before deeper connection. People want to know who they're inviting into their lives.

Professional-social hybrid relationships—networking contacts, activity group members, neighborhood acquaintances—almost always involve some online research. The person deciding whether to grab coffee, invite you to an event, or deepen the acquaintance is forming impressions from your search results.

Negative online content can create social friction you never trace to its source. Invitations that don't come. Relationships that stay surface-level. Connections that seem to stall without explanation.

# The Peace of Mind Factor

Beyond tangible opportunities, there's a psychological dimension to online reputation that's hard to quantify but very real.

People who know they have negative content online describe persistent low-grade anxiety. Every new interaction carries a question: have they searched me? Did they find it? Are they treating me differently because of something they read?

Job interviews feel fraught. New relationships feel precarious. Professional networking carries an undercurrent of dread. The content doesn't need to surface explicitly—its mere existence creates psychological weight.

Conversely, people who've audited their online presence and found it clean describe genuine peace of mind. They enter interviews confident that background searches support rather than undermine them. They pursue relationships without worrying what Google reveals. They network freely.

Knowing your reputation score isn't just about damage control. It's about removing uncertainty that silently affects how you move through the world.

# What Can Be Done to Mitigate Reputation Issues

If you discover problems, options exist.

**For content that violates platform policies:** File removal requests citing specific violations. Harassment, defamation, false information, and privacy violations often qualify for removal. Initial requests frequently fail, but appeals can succeed.

**For content that violates laws:** Legal removal pathways exist through both source platforms and Google directly. Defamation, copyright infringement, and certain privacy violations may qualify for legal takedown.

**For content that can't be removed:** Suppression strategies push negative results down by creating and promoting positive content that outranks them. This takes time—typically six to twelve months—but works when removal doesn't.

**For thin or neutral presence:** Building positive content proactively creates a buffer against future attacks. Strong profiles, professional content, and diverse positive results make it harder for any single negative item to dominate.

The appropriate strategy depends on what you're dealing with—which requires knowing what actually exists.

# Monitoring: The Ongoing Requirement

Online reputation isn't static. New content gets published. Old content rises or falls in rankings. Reviews accumulate. Articles get syndicated.

What looked fine six months ago might look different today. Regular monitoring catches problems early when they're easier to address.

Set up Google Alerts for your name. Search yourself periodically in incognito mode. Check platforms where reviews or mentions might appear. Treat reputation monitoring as routine maintenance rather than crisis response.

# The Starting Point: Know Where You Stand

You can't manage what you haven't measured. You can't address problems you don't know exist. You can't feel peace of mind about something you've never examined.

Before worrying about strategy or mitigation, the first step is simply understanding what your reputation score looks like. What appears when someone searches you? What impression does it create? What might be silently affecting your opportunities?

If you want to find out, Reputation Return offers a free tool called Rep Radar that scans search engines and social platforms to show what others see when they look you up. You can check your reputation score at [https://reputationreturn.com/rep-radar](https://reputationreturn.com/rep-radar) no cost, no obligation, just clarity about where you currently stand.

**Welcome to the Olympic Peninsula Button Maker Journey!**

**Where Art Meets Activism on the Edge of the Salish Sea.**

Welcome, neighbors and makers! Whether you found us through a pin on someone’s lapel in downtown Port Townsend, or followed the link from the [Button Journey Blog](https://buttonjourney.blogspot.com), we’re glad you’re here.

This community is a digital ""maker-space"" and gathering point for folks on the Olympic Peninsula (and beyond) who believe that a 2.25-inch circle can be a powerful tool for change.

# What We’re About

This isn’t just about hobby-craft; it’s about **Citizen Journalism**. We use buttons to document the moments that the mainstream media might miss, to stand in solidarity with movements like the *National Day of Solidarity with Minnesota*, and to keep names like **Renee Nicole Good** in the public eye.

**Here, you can:**

* **Share Your Designs:** Post photos of the buttons you’re pressing. Whether they are for local protests, family reunions, or grandkids' birthdays, we want to see them.
* **Talk Technique:** Stuck on a template? Need advice on paper weight or how to get that perfect ""electric yellow"" border? Ask away.
* **Collaborate on Causes:** Use this space to coordinate button distributions for upcoming marches or community events in PT, Sequim, and across the Peninsula.
* **Connect the Dots:** Discuss the stories behind the buttons—like the history of the ""ICE Out For Good"" campaign or local solidarity efforts.

# The Vibe

We aim for a community that feels like a Port Townsend coffee shop on a rainy Tuesday: **thoughtful, creative, and fiercely community-oriented.**

* **Be Kind & Neighborly:** We are a multigenerational group (from grandparents to the little ones). Let’s keep the dialogue respectful and constructive.
* **Stay Local, Think Global:** While our heart is in the PNW, our eyes are on the world. We welcome discussions on how national issues—from Minnesota to Venezuela—impact us here at home.
* **No ""Lying Eyes"":** We value intellectual honesty and raw, authentic storytelling.

# Get Started

Introduce yourself in the comments! Tell us:

1. **When did you start making buttons?** (Our founder, Jack, has been at it since 2016!)
2. **What’s one cause or person you want to highlight on a button right now?**

Grab your press, check your margins, and let's make something that matters.

1qkaknt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qkaknt/crypto_layer_2_and_scaling_rcryptocurrency_academy/,Crypto Layer 2 and Scaling (rCryptoCurrency Academy),"Welcome back to the r/CryptoCurrency Academy.

https://preview.redd.it/096fip3ngzeg1.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3af33a5c612337fff915bb212b39caf83237a310

One of the biggest criticisms of some cryptocurrencies is that they can be slow and expensive. If you try to use a major blockchain during busy periods, fees can skyrocket, making small purchases difficult.

If crypto is to handle global finance - buying coffee, trading stocks, and running apps - it needs to process millions of transactions per second.

One of the industry’s solution to this is a technology called **Layer 2**.

# The Problem: The Blockchain Trilemma

To understand why blockchains can be slow, one must understand the **Blockchain Trilemma**. In computer science, some people believe a blockchain can only prioritize two of the following three features:

1. **Decentralization:** No single entity controls the network.
2. **Security:** The network is immutable and resistant to attacks.
3. **Scalability (Speed):** The network can handle massive transaction volume cheaply.

https://preview.redd.it/eu3fh19ljzeg1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=4980c9642059d26b0f4850798131c066d41ee1fd

Major blockchains (Layer 1) prioritized **Decentralization** and **Security**.

They are designed to be secure digital vaults. To achieve this, every node in the network verifies every transaction.

This makes them secure, but inherently slow.

# One Solution: Layer 2

Developers realized that trying to make the main blockchain faster often compromised security.

Instead, they decided to stop processing every single transaction on the main chain.

They built a secondary framework **on top** of the main blockchain.

* **Layer 1 (The Settlement Layer):** This is the main blockchain (e.g., Ethereum). Its only job is to be the ultimate source of truth and security.
* **Layer 2 (The Execution Layer):** This is where some transactions can happen. It is designed for speed and low cost.

# How it Works: The ""Bar Tab"" Model

The simplest way to understand the relationship between Layer 1 and Layer 2 is the concept of a **Bar Tab**.

* **Layer 1 Transaction:** Paying for every single drink individually with a credit or gift card  is slow and incurs a transaction fee every time.
* **Layer 2 Transaction:** Opening a tab. The bartender records your drinks on a notepad. You get your drinks instantly, and there is no bank transaction fee for each order.
* **Settlement:** At the end of the night, you pay the **total** sum once on the main register.

Some Layer 2 networks work similarly. They process thousands of transactions externally, then bundle them up and submit a single proof to the main blockchain to be ""settled.""

# Rollups: Bundling for Efficiency

One of the primary technologies used is called a **Rollup**.

A Rollup ""rolls up"" thousands of individual transfers into a single packet of data. The Layer 2 network executes these transactions and simply posts the final result to Layer 1.

Because the expensive transaction fee on Layer 1 is split among thousands of users in the bundle, the individual cost for each user becomes fractions of a penny.

# The Trade-off

If Layer 2 is faster, why do we need Layer 1?

Layer 1 remains the anchor. It provides the security and the final settlement.

Layer 2 networks are faster but rely on Layer 1 to finalize their data. If the Layer 1 blockchain disappeared, the Layer 2 network would lose its security guarantee.

For the end user, this means you can enjoy the speed of a modern app with the security of a decentralized blockchain running in the background.

# Layers and Layers

You can build Layer 2, Layer 3, Layer n basically.

An example of Layer 3 would be a bar tab being divided further between many people. And then you can build a credit and debt system for people sharing the tab. And so on.

Some people believe that Layer 1 can eventually be optimized for anything, making Layer 2s unnecessary. However, as of this day and age, Layer 2s remain an important historical aspect of crypto, worth learning about on this Educational Series.

# Summary

* **Layer 1** is the **Main Blockchain**, usually used for Settlement. It can be slow, expensive, and hyper-secure.
* **Layer 2** is anything **built on top** of the Main Blockchain. It can be faster, cheaper, and may handle more volume.
* **Rollups** bundle thousands of transactions and settle them as one.
* **Layer Scaling** means using Layers to improve blockchains like with Rollups or using other methods.
* There are, of course, many other ways to scale blockchains, including just improving Layer 1 cryptos.

Been pretty much just a drip coffee guy since just making coffee at home and when I went out it was ice coffee. Quick and simple. Over the last month or so I’ve been over the volume of coffee if that makes any sense, so I’ve been just getting double espresso or short cappuccinos costing like 8 plus dollars sometimes. So I started researching at home machines, came down to breville or the ninja. And if you’re on the fence like I was lemme tell you just go with the ninja. A huge part of me wanted to geek out again and pull the most amazing espresso shots… but ultimately I just wanted caffeine quick and to the point.  So today I bought the ninja luxe cafe pro, a big purchase for sure. I brought it home picked up some beans on the way, set it up and followed the instructions. Just following the barista assist it pulled a pretty decent double espresso. I’m sure I’ll fine tune it a bit but it did the job as advertised. I will say the automatic milk frother was meh and will have to maybe try it again another time. But I’ll just manually steam the milk since I worked in cafes (picture included is my first cap made in 11 years lol)…my only hope is this it lasts as long as my drip coffee machine which is also ninja and still working exceptional after 7 years. Use filtered water and get good beans and you’ll be set. ",5,1769124861.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,0.78,False
1qkahlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qkahlp/am_i_overreacting_for_for_arguing_with_my_mil/,Am i Overreacting for for arguing with my MIL over the style of my wedding dress?,"Sorry for any formatting issues, I am extremely frustrated, slightly tipsy and typing this on mobile. This was originally posted to another subreddit, but the more I’ve thought about it tonight the angrier I’ve became so I’m reposting.

I (25f) and my Fiancé (34m) grew up together; he was my brother’s closest friend from kindergarten and we’ve had a whirlwind romance after I graduated from college and moved back to my home state. 

We’ve been engaged for just over a year now, generally there has been no glaring issues in this relationship, however the wedding planning has taken it’s toll on us. His mom (54F) raised him by herself, I’ve always known about the close relationship between them, but growing up I’d only met her a handful of times. My older brother (33M) used to prefer their hangouts happening at our home as she could be very overbearing. 

I didn’t believe him at first as she did have him quite young, from what he’s told me she dropped out of her dream school to have him and raise him so it would be understandable for her to be protective, however, I have noticed her crossing some boundaries in regards to my choices regarding my own wedding. For example, I have always wanted a pastel spring wedding, but she insisted that we need to get married in the fall. At first it was just little suggestions here and there that we both ignored, but she had escalated and is now trying to dictate every aspect of the day that we tell her about. 

Today was the day I was purchasing my wedding dress, she phoned me on my way to the bridal store asking what day “our dress fitting” was on and proceeded to shout over the phone about how I “never told her the correct date” and that she “had it marked in her calendar for next month”. Despite being hurt that she was trying to make a big moment for me all about herself yet again, I extended an invite for her to join us at the store as it was only a 15 minute drive from her home.

She showed up after I’d already chosen my dress. I absolutely fell in love with this big princess style gown, it’s dramatic but somehow classy with a trail and matching veil and it makes me feel like the queen I have wanted to be on my wedding day since I was a young girl. 

She walked in, coffee in hand and proceeded to ask when I was going to take her suggestions for my dress into account. I told her that this was the dress I had chosen, I’d fallen in love with it and was just waiting for her to arrive to see it and make the payment, as she said that she was going to be paying for my dress as she cannot contribute to any other part of our special day. She told me that SHE wanted to be the one to pick my dress, as my future husband (her “baby boy”) would think that this is hideous and frumpy and that I needed to remember that it’s not just my wedding day, but also his. 

I told her that he has no say in what I choose to wear  to our wedding, I am not dictating the type of tux he wears as long as it follows our chosen color scheme. She told me that as she was paying, I had to buy the dress she chose. I decided to humour her and she picked the most “cheugy” mermaid style dress I had ever seen, I don’t think this style looks truly awful on most people, however I am not blessed in the chest enough to pull this off.

I reached my breaking point when she said that SHE had always wanted a mermaid style dress for her wedding but never met the right man for her. My cousin (26f), who is also my maid of honor, has been sick of MIL’s behaviour for a while and couldn’t help herself from making a comment about how it almost seemed like she wanted to be the one marrying her son, we’d had a few glasses of prosecco that morning to set the mood for a good day out so this comment did not surprise me. 

I agreed and said that it almost seemed like she was planning the wedding for herself without me and my fiancé in mind, I wasn’t her dress up doll and i’m not willing to go along with this for the rest of my life. My mom (60F) prefers to try keep the peace in stressful situations, so she told me to hear MIL out and see if we could come to a compromise over the dress. I decided that I was having my dream dress and paid for it myself to stop any bickering. 

MIL is now refusing to come to our wedding unless I return the dress and wear one that she has chosen. My fiancé sympathises with her, he knows how much she has sacrificed to raise him and feels truly upset about her refusing to attend her only sons wedding over something as simple as a dress, however I am absolutely refusing to back down on this when she has tried to meddle in so many aspects of our special day already.

I would truly appreciate any advice, I took this week off of work to deal with finalising some planning details for the wedding (I work from home so it’s not really the biggest deal with my employer if I need time off as i can make it up later). I have had a few more glasses of wine at my cousins place so I may not check this app until tomorrow.",3,1769124853.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.81,False

1qka2qj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qka2qj/debating_a_return_to_smoking_cbd_bud_and_feeling/,Debating a return to smoking CBD bud and feeling tangled up inside,"I don’t know what I really expect from this post, but I want to get my thoughts written out. And I’m sorry if this comes across rude, but I want to gently say up top that I can’t really get anything out of responses explaining how individuals personally don’t have a problem with weed, how it’s r/stopdrinking not stop everything (I’m here to talk about my personal decision making, not re-baptize the subreddit), how coffee is a drug (believe me, I pinky promise, it’s *not* in the same league as several bowls of top shelf CBD bud dusted in type 3 kief, which is truly honest to goodness psychoactive however comparatively subtly so when put against alcohol or THC). I know I can’t control what replies I get but please just know that this isn’t a vapid non-problem I’m making up for no reason. 

I have a history of weed addiction in addition to alcoholism, but have been weed-sober for over 2 years and have no desire to smoke actual weed ever again. In those 2 years I’ve had multiple periods of (moderate to heavy) usage of CBD flower without relapsing on THC (which again just feels like a total non-starter, out of my life forever, no cravings to battle because I simply don’t consider it; it was that bad of an addiction). 

My almost 5 months sober (completely sober) right now are my longest ever. A year ago I had 3 months sober from alcohol while smoking a lot of CBD bud, which ended after I started craving alcohol again and was promptly given a six pack as a “gift”. I really want it to be possible for me to resume CBD without halting my personal growth or risking a relapse on a different substance. When I look at the history of my addiction and recovery, my CBD use doesn’t actually seem to correlate with my sobriety or my relapses. I’ve used CBD while unable to quit drinking for more than a couple days, I’ve been unable to quit drinking for more than a couple days when I wasn’t using CBD, and I used CBD during those 3 months alcohol free…. so how does CBD relate to sobriety? 

I don’t intend to use it to “keep me sober” because I don’t think it can, I think that’s a totally separate choice I make. I don’t want to use it to “deal with” negative emotions, I want to stay connected to reality, and I want to continue my personal recovery and to continue growing emotional regulation skills. I just want the gentle CBD buzz to also be part of my life, if possible, and I just don’t know if it’s possible or how to even tell. It is not like coffee, it is not like an NA beer, and I’m not going to lie to you and say it’s anything other than a desire to experience an altered state. 

I just haven’t had any negative life consequences from CBD bud. My 3 months of CBD use last year were a period of significant personal growth, but I do think that growth was also hampered in a few ways at the same time by not being completely sober. I hadn’t crossed the Rubicon of making art sober, for instance. I genuinely don’t know how to run the cost/benefit on CBD.

I think it’s sort of circular logic to say that the questioning itself of the idea consuming CBD proves that the idea must be bad… I think it’s also a bit circular to say that any mood alteration is bad because the desire to seek out mood alteration indicates sickness or lack…. With THC and alcohol those things are *certainly* true for me, considering all the harm they did me, but with CBD bud I don’t know. My fear that CBD *might* be bad can’t be used as proof that it is bad, and I simply don’t believe that all instances of mood alteration all over the world are sick, or morally corrupt, or failures of maturity, or what have you. I just don’t know whether that’s what CBD, specifically, is for me, specifically. And I don’t expect anyone else to know that answer for me, it just fucks me up to not know where the line is. 

So this feels like a bit of a spinning my wheels post. But I do think I need to take more inventory of where I am and where I hope to go. I’m between field seasons at my actual job, living in a cold dark lonely place, and doing the gig work grind for the winter. I would love to have CBD bud as a chill little lifestyle choice, but I don’t want it to become my way of dealing with winter. I haven’t been reflecting much on what I’ve achieved in staying away from alcohol for this long, because I don’t have any physical manifestations, no one ever knew about my problem, and I just live in an isolated whirlwind of stress and dissatisfaction, then and now. But no, in reality I’ve made a great change, and have to expect even more to improve over time. I was so proud of myself at the start, I was so excited for the future, and I can’t treat myself like I’ve reached my plateau at only 5 months.

1qka2hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID/comments/1qka2hr/gagging_vomiting_at_other_people_eating_food/,Gagging & vomiting at OTHER people eating food?,"Hi all - our son (8) is diagnosed with ARFID, ADHD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Dyslexia. He’s undergone CBT/exposure therapy for about 18 months and has made significant progress compared to where we were when he started. Like many with ARFID, he has a limited rotation of the same 8-10 “safe” foods (peanut and egg allergies don’t help matters), but is otherwise pretty healthy and close to his expected growth marks.

He has a strong aversion to most foods, whether out in the world or on TV. He can walk around a supermarket with fruits, vegetables, canned foods, bread, etc. and be fine. But if you walk by the “hot bar” with a wide variety of differing prepared food, he immediately has a reaction. I understand that this is fairly common due to the sight and smells of “scary” and unfamiliar foods and we do what we can to de-stigmatize these as much as we can and are actively working on it together.

**What my main question is, does anyone else have experience with intense physical reactions to the sight of OTHER people eating, to the point of vomiting?** 

My son consistently gags and/or “throws up” at the sight of this with others. 98% of the time this is more like spitting up vs. full blown vomiting. But it makes parties, holidays, family get togethers, etc. extremely difficult because he’s stressed (“will there be food there?” at birthday parties, which we usually leave early) and my wife and I are constantly on high alert for these possible triggers. He has made AMAZING strides with both of us at home, with select caveats - we’ve gone from not being able to drink coffee around him and having to eat everything in another room to now being able to eat certain snacks around him and also sharing McDonald’s fries together in the car(!) - but outside of the home is different. He sits alone at lunch at school and still regularly “throws up” a few times per week … and is also at the age where he’s the kid that’s known for being “scared of food”. He struggles at restaurants, which we can sometimes pull off due to the help of a tablet or activity book. Sitting at a dinner table with extended family is completely out. Occasionally (and particularly when he’s sick) he will still throw up at the sight of my wife and I eating even if it was something we ate in front of him the day before. Commercials on TV are hit or miss as to whether he’ll have a reaction or not. 

We’re getting all the help we can and he’s the BEST kid and we’re so proud of him, but this is a very isolating situation for all of us as we don’t know anyone else who has this physical, vomiting reaction around others. We want him to know that he’s not alone, could anyone please share if they have or are undergoing anything similar? Thanks so much!",7,1769123804.0,ARFID,2,0.9,False

Ever had that moment where you check your bank account, see a number that *should* feel impressive, and yet… it doesn’t? Like, sure, you’ve got savings, but does it *actually* mean anything for your future? Or is it just sitting there, collecting digital dust while you stress about retirement?

Here’s the wild truth: **Most people underestimate how far their savings can go.** Not because they’re bad with money, but because they’ve never *seen* what it could turn into. A few tweaks, a little strategy, and suddenly, that nest egg isn’t just a number—it’s a *lifestyle upgrade*.

### **The 3 Money Myths Holding You Back**
1. **""I don’t have enough to invest.""**
   - False. Even $50/month can snowball into serious cash over time. (Compound interest is the OG hustler—it works while you sleep.)
   - *Example:* If you stash $200/month at 7% interest, you’d have **$250K in 30 years**. Not bad for skipping a few lattes.

2. **""Retirement is decades away—I’ll figure it out later.""**
   - Later = more stress, fewer options. The earlier you start, the less you *need* to save. (Procrastination is expensive.)

3. **""I need a finance degree to make this work.""**
   - Nah. The best investors? Regular people who **start small, stay consistent, and use the right tools**.

### **The One Move That Changes Everything**
Here’s the game-changer: **Seeing your savings in action.** Not as a static number, but as a *living, growing plan* for your future.

👉 **You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.** [Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb). *(FYI: That’s an affiliate link—if you sign up, I earn a little coffee money at no cost to you!)*

### **The Bottom Line**
Money isn’t about restriction—it’s about **freedom**. The freedom to quit a job you hate, travel on a whim, or just sleep easy knowing you’re covered.

So ask yourself: *If your future self could thank you for one money move today, what would it be?*

Tired of that single-purpose handheld milk frother taking up precious counter space, only to deliver mediocre foam? We get it. In a world where coffee shops offer endless options, why should your home setup be so limited? The real smart move isn't just a better frother; it's a machine that redefines your entire coffee experience, offering unparalleled versatility without the premium price tag.

This is where the HiBREW coffee machine shines, offering a compact solution that rivals even the most dedicated handheld frother, while simultaneously delivering \*actual\* espresso. Forget being locked into one type of pod or dealing with lukewarm, weak coffee. HiBREW’s ingenious design gives you true coffee freedom.

Here’s why HiBREW is the upgrade you didn’t know you needed:

*   **The Universal Advantage:** Say goodbye to pod limitations! HiBREW machines are 4-in-1 or 5-in-1, brewing from K-Cup, Nespresso, Dolce Gusto, and even your favorite ground coffee. It’s like having multiple machines in one sleek unit.
*   **True Espresso Power:** Don't settle for less. Our 19-bar (or 20-bar on Pro models) high-pressure extraction system guarantees rich, authentic espresso, complete with a perfect crema. Your lattes and cappuccinos will finally taste like they’re from a top-tier café.
*   **Brew Anywhere, Any Way:** Need your caffeine fix on the go? The H4 series even uses a 12V car adapter, making it perfect for road trips, camping, or long commutes. Plus, enjoy refreshing iced coffee or piping hot espresso from the same machine!

Stop compromising. It’s time to invest in a coffee solution that’s as adaptable and ambitious as you are. Explore the HiBREW collection today and experience the future of home coffee brewing.",1,1769123592.0,CoffeeTraveler,0,1.0,False

At the end he asked for my phone number to ""chat"" which I already thought was out of the ordinary but whatever I guess. He sent a ""hi"" testing text just to confirm and that was pretty much that.  
  
So it was VERY strange when I saw a text from him during today at school asking me if I wanted to grab a quick coffee/boba today because he 'happened to be' in the general area of my high school.  
  
Genuinely not sure what to do but I think this is grounds for an email to the admissions right?
