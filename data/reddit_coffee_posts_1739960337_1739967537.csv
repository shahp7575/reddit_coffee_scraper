1it41ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1it41ox/my_summer_babysitter/,My Summer Babysitter,"When I was growing up, my mother would have a new boyfriend almost every month. She was an amazing woman who I wouldn’t have traded for the world but she was raised by horrible people, had an abusive high school sweetheart, and had a hard time saying “No.” The cycle usually went that she would meet some jackass at her job, I never learned what she did for a living, and likely for good reason, and he would love bomb her until he found a nicer piece of tail or found out I existed. I ended up being the deal breaker more times than not from what I can remember. Darren was the first to break the cycle sticking around for 4 months before they got engaged and he moved in which was when the troubles started. I remember being 6 years old watching Power Rangers and Darren walked over to me to put a cigarette out on the webbing between my fingers which soon became his preferred way of saying hello. Through the walls of our shitty Section 8 apartment, I could hear him screaming at my mom every night before beating her. It would only end when he went out for a beer, in which case my mom would “sleepover” in my room, or when he would get bored and demand she go to sleep. Darren made it very clear that if anyone came to check up on me or my mom that would be it for all of us and God knows I believed him. Even at my young age, I could tell from the look in his eyes that he was capable of and willing to do anything. I wore gloves year-round to hide the burns on my hands, came up with a hundred different stories for a hundred different bruises, and prayed every night the police would get lost when our neighbors called in a disturbance. When summer came around I would have the apartment to myself while Darren and Mom went to work. We didn’t have the money for camps or water parks so I would fill out phonics and math workbooks during commercial breaks. Then, about a month into the Summer, I got a knock at the door.



“Issac? My name is Finn. Your mother hired me to be your summer sitter.” I opened the door to a tall, skinny man holding a briefcase filled to bursting with toys and activities. “Hello, Issac, can I come in?”



Finn and I would do my daily homework together before making art projects or playing with the wrestling figures he brought over. We’d end each day with a walk around the neighborhood and get back just before anyone got home. I’d go back to my apartment and Finn would go to his at the very end of the hall. Every time we parted ways he’d hand me a candy from his briefcase and say “Same time tomorrow, little man” snapping his fingers and pointing at me. That would make me laugh every time. The good times with Finn gave me something to look forward to even when Darren got especially cruel. That summer his job started layoffs and despite his constant swearing they could never dump him I suspect it was the stress that led to his new rule. Talking without being spoken to was liable to get you beat, our apartment was so cramped he could hear me whisper to my mom which would always send him into a fury. I maybe spoke two times to my mom in that entire period and I didn’t dare to so much as look at Darren, not like that saved me from his wrath or anything. 



Around this time, Finn started asking me about my bruises, and I went through my usual stories to explain them. Finn wasn’t as easily deterred as a teacher or cop, however. Sometimes, he’d catch me in conflicting stories or press me on details, and I’d trip up. I stuck to my guns, however, and never told him anything. In hindsight, I wish I had, but it didn’t end up mattering. 



“Y’know, you can tell me anything. You aren’t going to be in any trouble.” I knew Finn wouldn’t hurt me but I still couldn’t say anything to him, Darren’s threats had my conscience hostage. I just said “Ok” and he gave me a look like I really hurt him with that. 



Maybe because of that, our art projects became therapy sessions. When I told Finn my dreams were scaring me we made dream catchers and talked about how to destress before bed. We made paper superhero masks when I said I wished I was braver. The one time I even implied Darren could be a bad guy, Finn had to draw a knight and a dragon then helped me prop them up on a page like a pop-up book. We had a long talk about how knights are heroes in a story, they don’t cover for bad guys or make excuses when they mess up. They summon their courage and do what’s right even if puts someone else at risk because heroes fight dragons they don’t protect them. The meaning wasn’t lost on me but at that age, you can dodge any type of guilt by just not thinking about it. No matter what my issue was, Finn had an art project for it. It was like he had everything we could ever need in that briefcase.



One day he came home stomping mad. Finn and I had made origami cranes and I planned to give mine to my mom but she didn’t get home first. Darren picked up the crane from the coffee table, sparked his cigarette lighter, and burned it in front of my eyes. I wanted to beat the shit out of him to just take my tiny, scarred hands and smash them into his chest until his ribcage broke open. I screamed in a way you can’t replicate or do justice to in writing, my breaking point was reached and I lost complete control of my body as I ran up and bit into Darren’s leg so hard I swear I felt his tibia grind between my teeth. Darren pulled me back and shouted horrible things as he wrapped his hands around my neck and squeezed. 



“I’m gonna kill you, fucking cum stain. I’m gonna bury you in a scrap yard.” He didn’t make good on that promise, he just threw me against a wall right as my vision began to blur. I scurried to my room and blocked the door with a folding chair I kept in case things got really bad. 



When my mom got home Darren wasted no time showing her his battle scar and saying I should be put up for adoption or kicked into the street. She tried to talk him down and got hit in return, I could hear her gasping for air between sobs and screaming “He’s just a baby!” as Darren desperately tried to break my makeshift barricade. He must’ve been too drunk to counter the oldest trick in the book. I didn’t sleep that night and neither did my mom, every time I braved a peek under the door I could see her slumped against the wall crying or passed out once cursing that she was ever born. When I let Finn in the next day his usual bright smile was absent. He asked about the bruise that wrapped around my neck like a scarf and I said I got it wrestling some neighborhood kids. 



“Your eyes look so tired, didn’t you sleep?” I just looked down and said I had a nightmare. Finn frowned and squatted to be eye level with me, “Issac, lets take the day off from homework. You wanna go to the zoo?” What kid doesn’t? We spent hours exploring the place, Finn put me on his shoulders when my legs got tired but wouldn’t move an inch until I was ready for the next animal. We were watching big fish in the aquarium when he sat down on a bench and I sat with him.



“What's your favorite color, Issac?” Maybe it was because we were surrounded by it but I instantly said blue. “No argument here, that's a good one. Lots of versatility too, some people think it's very calming but it’s been used to represent loyalty and trust too. Means you got a good heart, little man.” We paused to watch a shark swim over our heads in the clear viewing room. 



“How about your mom, what’s her favorite color?” I wasn’t sure about this one. Again, Darren’s tight restrictions on when we could speak had caused me to rarely speak to my mom, and at 6 years old its not like you have a lot of information about your mom memorized. I knew what colors were girly though and picked purple. “Good taste runs in the family. Purple used to be a really expensive color you know, they reserved it for royalty.” Finn’s face turned serious and he looked me in the eyes, “I know things are hard for you guys right now but try to remember your mom does a lot for you. Most people don’t appreciate it until they’re really big kids, being a mom is a thankless job most of the time, try to remind her how much you love her as often as you can, ok?” That’s the type of emotional sentiment you don’t understand until you’re older but even then I felt my heart grow a bit. The sharks above us started to chase each other and I giggled cheering on the smaller one deftly ducking his pursuer. 



On the bus ride back, Finn offered me a piece of candy and asked “What’s your least favorite color?” This one was easy, I hated yellow. “Same here buddy, never seen a shade of yellow that wasn’t tacky or garish. You ever hear someone get called ‘yellow-bellied’ on TV, Issac?” I had once in a cowboy cartoon but told Finn I didn’t know what it meant. “It means cowardly, a scaredy cat, and do you know what the mark of a real yellow-bellied man is? It's being a bully, no is more cowardly than someone who hurts others to make himself feel big.” Finn’s gaze turned inquisitive like his eyes were the interrogation lamp you see in police dramas. He asked me in the most serious tone, “Remind you of anyone, Issac?” 



God knows I wanted to say Darren. Just like when we learned about bullies in school. Just like when the preacher asked if any of us knew a bad person. Just like when the teacher asked where my bruises came from. Just like when the police asked if I had heard anything scary. I wanted to scream “Darren! Darren! It's him! Fucking shoot the bastard!” But if I did, Darren would’ve hurt us terribly. So I said no, that I don’t talk to bad guys and all my friends are nice. Finn sighed and checked his watch. “We’ve got time for one more activity little man. I think you’re gonna like this one.”



When we got home, Finn opened his briefcase and pulled out a box of cupcake mix. After a few minutes of searching for the right pans and trays we got to work and produced one beautiful tray of little domed treats. We ate them until only four were left at which point Finn set them on top of the fridge and got another box from his briefcase, frosting mix, then a set of food color droppers. We made three small bowls of frosting: Blue, purple, then yellow. Finn put blue on two cupcakes, these we shared, then purple on one, and finally, he took his time applying the yellow frosting on the last. 



“Who should we give these to?” Finn asked with a smirk. I said my mom and Finn said grown-ups can only eat one cupcake a day or they get sick, their stomachs don’t handle sugar as well as kids do. I didn’t want to but I said Darren could have one too. “Good, maybe it’ll make him happy.” Finn washed the dishes and put the cupcakes on separate plates before heading back down the hall to his apartment after giving me another piece of candy. This many sweets paired with the zoo trip had Finn in a close race with my mom and the red ranger for the greatest person alive. 



Mom got home first that day and I proudly gave her the purple cupcake. She smiled brightly for the first time I can remember seeing and asked how I made them.



“Finn helped me!” I said, beaming. She cocked her head but smiled and finished her treat. 



When Darren got home he cursed the traffic and screamed out for dinner to be ready. With lead feet and trying not to scowl, I offered him the yellow cupcake. To my surprise, he thanked me before inhaling it, even said my name. I still remember the wonderful dreams I had that night, would’ve been one for the record books if I didn’t wake with a jolt as my mom screamed bloody murder. I ran to her room because this wasn’t the screaming I had learned meant I should hide, this was a brand new kind of scream that told my instincts to check out what was happening. Lying next to my mom in bed was Darren. He had clearly been thrashing violently in his sleep with one arm under him at an unnatural angle and his knees pointing up with legs spread like he was giving birth. But his face is what I really remember, it's been a recurring topic with every therapist I’ve ever had. 



His eyes were piss yellow and wide open. Try as I have, and believe you me I have tried, I can’t open mine that wide without using my fingers and enduring some great discomfort. His jaw was open and popped to the side like a freeze frame from a Mike Tyson hook, detectives on the scene said it was dislocated. His skin was drawn tight over his skull, and this really stood out on a big guy like Darren. Imagine if you could vacuum seal one of those Mission Impossible masks and then left it out in the sun so its color fades and that's about what I was looking at. From his forehead down to the left corner of his lips was one long scratch, not the type you give yourself when you forget to trim your nails before bed but more like what a pissed-off cat leaves. All of this froze me in place. When I did get the courage to step forward, my knees buckled. Mom scooped me up and took me to the kitchen where she dialed 911. I don’t remember much of the following but after a week of questioning and investigation, they finally left us alone to piece together our lives again. 



Mom stayed home with me for a few days after that. We did my homework together and went on walks through the park. I thought about asking where Finn was, but honestly, I was still so shocked from seeing my first corpse that I didn’t say much at all during that time. When my mom went back to work, Finn came over for the last time.



“Listen, Issac, school is gonna start soon for you and that means you won’t need me for a while. I want you to be good for your mom, ok? She loves you dearly and this is going to be a hard time for her.”	“Will you be my babysitter next summer?” Finn had become like a big brother to me, I didn’t want to face the world without him or go a day without our fun arts and crafts projects.



“I’m sorry little man. I’m going to college soon and by the time summer starts for you I’m gonna be a long ways away. But we’ll always have our memories, ok? Anytime you start to miss me just do some origami like we like to do.” He smiled and put a hand on my shoulder. “If I start to miss you, I’ll watch do our Power Ranger poses.” That day he taught me how to handle the strong feelings I had in the fallout of Darren kicking the bucket and we made stress toy cootie catchers.



Mom and I moved out as soon as we were able. It took about a month of searching for an affordable spot and two months of saving money to finally leave and for all of it Mom slept with me in my bed. Not that I minded, I was honestly happy Darren was dead and I finally had time to be a kid with my mom again. When we did move out I helped move boxes down to our van. It was when I ran up to get the last box that I saw the door at the end of the hallway was open a jar. 



“Finn? Finn, you left your door open!” I shouted across the hall to no reply. I bounced over and repeated myself to the same effect. Childlike curiosity and disregard for social boundaries led me to push open the door and peek at Finn’s apartment. In hindsight, it makes sense. Just looking at the outside of the building raises questions about where you’d even have space for something there. Behind that door was just a utility closet.

I have issue which I thought I've got rid of but I'm not sure. I've got the problem that the shots in taste sometimes didn't give much flavour. It taste like water with some additions like it was lacking the taste but texture was fine. It isn't due to ratio, grind setting because I tried even 1:1.75 and it can still be the same. The grind setting change a bit but not too much. The shot time is around 30s at 5-8s      2 bar preinfusion and 20s 9 bar decline. I find that really slowly inclining the pressure gives better full tasting results. Also fast applying 9 bars work well and gives more aicidity. It doesn't work when I use preinfusion tho. Is it the fast or slow ramping up the case or I'm missing something? The water temperature is just strict of the boil without preheating the piston. I tried preheating but it didn't change much, like yeah coffee was hotter but not in the term of taste. The coffee beans which  I tested it at was medium light/ medium to medium dark. Have any of you the same observations? Maybe robot isn't working well at higher pressures and it's best to use lower like 6-7? I try to use the 9 bars for only a few seconds.

I was up in MN for work when my parent got the call for a heart transplant. I offered to come home but my family said i wouldn’t make it back on time and everything looked good to go and I’d see them when I got back in 2 weeks.

Well it went bad and they ended up being placed into a medical coma and on ECMO so I had to rush back. It was a 2 day drive back to TX and so I drove back to OK and stayed the night and got up at 330am the next day to try and rush to the hospital. I was exhausted and stopped at the first Starbucks I saw that was open.

There was only one car in front of me and no one behind me so the person wasn’t trying to start a “pay it forward” line or anything. I pulled up and they let me know the person in front of me paid for my coffee. I burst into tears.

It’s crazy - buying that coffee had nothing to do with the outcome of my parent’s surgery or recovery. But I really thought I was driving back to plan a funeral. When someone bought me that coffee I took that kind gesture as a sign that things were going to be OK. And while it was a long long stay in the hospital and a long road to recovery my parent survived. But it changed my entire outlook and gave me peace to make the rest of my trip safely.

They’ll never know what that cup of coffee meant to me or what that act of kindness did for me that day.

1it3rdk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1it3rdk,Melitta Tritan Pour over Issues,"Hi so I have a melitta pour over cone made from tritan co polyester and really love it but have run into a few issues and have a few questions:

So this cone came with number 4 filters. Although I’m not using the exact same filters that it came with all number four cones stick up over the sides like this by about an inch. This leads me to believe that it’s really more designed for number 2 filter than number 4. Thoughts?

Secondly, this cone has a window which you can look through so you can make sure you don’t overpour. This isn’t really an issue for me since I use a scale, however, I have found that sometimes when making an extraction, the tension of the coffee liquid gets pulled out through the window to the outside of the cone. it’s super annoying and if I don’t notice it immediately then all my coffee literally pours right next to the cup. 

I want to chalk it up to design flaw, but wanted to check first if anyone else has had this type of experience with this cone or does mine have a fault? And finally what solutions you might recommend to mitigate this issue from happening? 

I’m considering widening the hole or maybe just sanding it lightly in case there is a piece of plastic sticking out which is causing the water to leak out to the side. 

Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks!

We have two kids (10F and 7M), and while things have never been perfect, I never thought I’d find myself in this situation.

Today, I asked him for a simple favor—helping me put away the groceries while I was prepping dinner. He sighed but got up, and I thought it was fine. But when I asked him to be careful stacking things in the fridge, he suddenly snapped. He slammed the fridge door so hard that bottles inside rattled, then he shoved a chair across the room and threw a dish towel at the counter. I just froze. The kids were in the living room and heard everything.

This isn’t the first time he’s reacted this way. Before the holidays, he got really angry at our son for accidentally knocking over his coffee. He yelled so loudly that our daughter started crying. I told him his reaction was over the top, and he stormed out of the house. When he came back, he acted like nothing happened.

I don’t know what to do. He’s never physically hurt me or the kids, but his anger is unpredictable and honestly, it’s starting to scare me. I don’t want my kids to grow up in a household where they feel like they have to walk on eggshells. I’ve tried talking to him, but he just brushes it off, saying I’m “overreacting” or that I “nag” him too much.

I’m exhausted. I love him, but I don’t know if I can keep living like this. How do I handle this? Should I push for counseling? Try to get him to see a doctor? Or is it time to seriously think about leaving?",23,1739966142.0,WhatShouldIDo,8,1.0,False

It's 3:30 am and I can't sleep. I don't know why I can't. I've been up since 6 am yesterday - I should be tired. I only had one cup of coffee today, no other caffeine, and I hardly consumed any sugar or carbs. Why won't my mind ever stop? Days like today are so exhausting. 

The therapist I've had for over a decade is no longer my therapist. Thanks to the current administration, she felt she had no other option but to move her family back to Colombia. She's a dual citizen, but her husband is not, and I don't blame her at all. I think she made the right decision, it just sucks for me and her other patients, and anyone else who's life will be emptier without her.

Now is a time I probably *should* talk to someone, but that also means starting over completely … I don't have the energy for that. I had a really good relationship with Inez, she *got* me, and I truly never felt judged, even when she would point out my mistakes or wrongdoing, she was always gentle in her rightful criticism - that's not easy to find in a therapist, or in people in general. I know that I was lucky, and she was definitely there when I needed it most, and I learned a lot from her. I'm doing my best to rely on that. By now I *should* have all of the tools I need to face any challenge …

But should is a tyrant, always assigning blame. You should do this, you shouldn't do that … says who? Think about it, how often is it your own voice? When you hear that voice in your mind telling what you should or shouldn't do, how often is it yours? In my case, I know it's almost never. But it's also not normally a voice I can place, maybe it's more an amalgamation of voices … be a lot cooler if it sounded like Darth Vader though. The James Earl Jones Darth Vader, obvi. 

It's 3:51 now, and I think I'm feeling a tinge sleepy … I'm going to take advantage, and ride this wave if I can … all the way to the shores of some far off land, where love never leaves and no one needs therapy. I'll meet you there 💜 sans Darth Vader voices (unless you're into that). 

p.s. pls don't ask why I write these like I'm talking to someone else, I don't understand it either. Maybe out of habit because I used to share them? Idk, I know no one reads them now, but I still write the same … 

Anyshit, g'night.

Currently I own a Wilfa Svart and a Delonghi kg79. I primarily drink filter coffee from a V60 which I use the Wilfa for and have no complaints, makes a lovely coffee. 
My wife tends to have a milky espresso drink using a Sage Bambino Plus and the Delonghi grinder, this combo has been very hit and miss. We're happy with the Bambino, as when we've bought pre ground espresso coffee it has produced lovely coffee.The issue with this combo is that the steps on the Delonghi are far too large and it can rarely go fine enough for most coffees. 
Ultimately I would like one grinder that is capable of doing both, but I'm having a hard time finding the right one. I had been looking at the Varia VS3 but the build quality issues had me concerned. I know the Niche is good at both but given it's 5 years old I don't know if there are any newer/cheaper/better grinders that compare to it. I know one thing I don't like is the workflow on the Eureka grinders where I would have to do multiple rotations of the adjuster to swap from filter to espresso. That would make me lose my mind!
So please if you have any advice I would really appreciate it as I'm quite lost at this point!

***“Maker help us all…” -Duncan (Dragon Age: Origins)***

Evelina had never stolen anything before, and luckily, it seemed, the dwarves had no enchantments to prevent thieves from making off with books from the library. Or perhaps this one simply wasn’t under the blanket of such security. She had, in a moment of curiosity, skipped ahead to the end of the book, which she now knew to be that last testament of a dead man. Or woman, it’d never been really described who or what Elimenise was, only that each entry began with them declaring their name. She wondered if perhaps they had issues remembering, or if that was simply how they wrote things all the time.

She had slipped the book into her clothes and simply walked out, then meandered casually back to the guild. Again she was only accosted a few times, but the guards remembered her and so gave her polite nods and didn’t bother her too much. By the time she’d made it back to the guild, people were just starting to filter out onto the streets. This naturally left her grumbling about something along the lines of not getting a wink of sleep, but that was partially her fault.

Still she was Surprised to find Erissir already awake, scarfing down breakfast. He blinked, glanced at the stairs and then to her and shrugged. “Couldn’t sleep, could ya?”“No, no I could not. Is it really that obvious?” He snorted at this question, waving a thick finger at her.

“Aye, it is. Ye look like ye’ve been chewed on by a dragon, spat out, chewed on by a Stelgran, and then chewed on a little more.”

Evelina stared, then rolled her eyes and sat.

“It just feels so…so..”

“Stifling?”

“Yes.”

“Claustrophobic?”

“Mhm.”

“Oppressive?”

“Yes! All those things!” She exclaimed, shaking her head as the dwarf snickered. “How you’re all able to handle this is beyond me. It just isn’t right. I should be able to look up and see stars, not stone.” Erissir simply kept snickering, at least he did until she flicked him on the nose.

“Oi! What was that for!?”

“I was hoping for a little sympathy, instead I got snickering. Cease!” He did not.

And was promptly tackled by a very tired elf.

Several hours later they were venturing out of the guild, fresh bruises and at least one or two little cuts adorning their bodies from their little tussle. The two of them were joking and just generally carousing as they headed back to the smithy.

A smithy where they retrieved their armor and were promptly on their way, joking and grinning and slapping each other on the back as hard as they could simply for the fun of it. It felt good to cut loose like this, actually have a laugh. It’d been so very serious for such a long time now that a moment of fun seemed almost foreign to them both.

And what was better was that after they were dressed and prepared for the journey ahead, the feeling didn’t stop, neither did the jokes most of which were made at Erissirs expense. Even Berenger seemed to chuckle now and then.

Upon reaching the gate, they found it to be in good working order, paid for safe passage through and upon receiving their travel papers, stepped on through. In a moment they had left Khan Tharim, leaving the entire realm behind entirely. And not a moment too soon.

As explosions began to rock the city.

– – –**Realm Yarnvalis, Jiherion**– – –

The duo stepped into the most disgustingly pastel city she’d had the misfortune of seeing with her own two eyes. The only saving grace of this place was the fact that there was sky over her head, real, honest to God sky…. It was also pastel.

The sound which left her was decidedly disgusted on a deep, visceral level, and even Erissir made a gagging sound, while Berenger whined and lowered himself to his belly, giant paws covering his eyes. The guards and travel attendants looked upon them sympathetically, their gazes haunted by all the pastel horrors they’d witnessed. The only people who did not seem bothered by this offense to color and common decency were the Qixnit who paraded about like it was all entirely normal, like nothing was wrong. Some even pointed and laughed, though they scampered away quickly when Evelina shot them a murderous glare.

“Please tell me we don’t have to linger here for too long?” She asked, and Erissir shook his head.

“Nay, not long. Just gotta get to the next gate and we’ll be able to leave this accursed place behind us.”

*Thank God for that.* She thought, and the two stepped away from the gate, handing over their papers and getting sent on their way. “Hopefully this other gate is nearby?”

“One city over, but we can get there quickly. These catfolk came up with an ingenious method of transportation, fer surface folk.”

*If only you knew, Erissir, if only you knew.* She would nod and the trio set off once more. “So, i was meaning to ask earlier but, what’s the story behind that dwarf, the one that always says ‘Slimes’?”

“Oh ye mean Frandel? Ah he’s a good lad. From the way his sisters tells it, poor lad got clocked on the head by debris during a cave in. Real young he was at the time. Ever since, he’s been obsessed with slimes, even keeping a bunch as pets. Strangely, they don’t seem ta hurt him. Dunno, maybe it's a wee bit of magic on his part.”

Evelina nodded, frowning a little. She’d known several other kids in her peer group like that, and while she’d never fraternized with them, she’d at least tried to be understanding of their predicaments. For a moment she wondered if they were still alive, had they made it out of the area when everything went to shit, or had they fallen in those first few days.

“Come along, pointy. We got places ta be. So let’s not dawdle if we can help it eh?” He chimed up, dragging her from her thoughts.

“P-Pointy! Alright shorty, you wanna play that game, then let's play!” She snarled, and the two were on their way again. Bergenger did what bears do.

He sighed rather deeply.

– – –**Realm Castellum/Eldarani (Earth/Efres)**– – –

The figure sat, doing his best to not let the rolling and rocking of the ship cause his stomach distress. It was a hard thing to do however, especially when some of those around him were already voiding themselves, the sound of sick hitting the decking was quite loud.

Finally he could stand it no more, and stood, his legs wobbling as he made for the stairs up to the main deck. It wasn’t much better up there but at least he could breathe easily enough, without the stench. They’d all be taking baths once they hit the mainland of those savage people.

Yet he couldn’t find it in him to think of them as savage. No doubt from what he’d heard from a few of the sailors that had seen these beings fight they were savage in battle, or perhaps coldly efficient was a better descriptor. But he had met one, or he presumed he had and she’d not been so savage. In fact he felt she’d been rather refined, civilized even. Only the following weeks would tell him what he needed to know however. 

Leaning against the rail he bowed his head, closing his eyes and trying to keep his breakfast down, and that’s when he heard it. A distant, droning sound. A very distant one, just on the edge of his hearing yet getting a little louder.

It was also well above his head, high in the sky. He looked up and so did many other elves, each of them looking confused before as one they peered upwards into the sky. He squinted, trying to see just what was making that noise.

It was a strange shape, it almost looked like a bird yet the wings were swept back like it was in a light dive, it had strange protrusions on those wings and though it was far away, he could still see a good portion of it. It struck him then, that if he could see so much of it from that distance, that it was larger than a mere speck, then it must be a very, very big bird.

And far, far away on those blue rolling waves, a man did speak.

– – – – – –

“Captain, AWACS reports contact with an enemy reinforcement detachment.”

“Very well. Gentlemen, battlestations if you please.” The captain said, sipping his coffee. The crew of the destroyer rushed to their positions, and one by one they reported ready. “Please inform our eye in the sky to provide targeting data. Let’s make sure none of them make landfall.”

“Aye aye. Beholder, you are ordered to provide targeting data on the enemy vessels. Repeat, provide targeting data on the enemy vessels.”

They waited for just a moment as confirmation of their orders came through, and before long the weapons officers received the locations of the enemy ships on their scopes.

“Sir, confirmation of target data. Counting six hostile vessels enroute for East Coast USA. They are within optimal distance for long range munitions.”

“Excellent. Guns, I want six Tomahawks in the air and on target. Fire at your leisure.”

“Aye captain.”

– – – – – –

The figure watched the strange thing in the sky and noted, with some mounting concern, that now it was circling them. It had tilted in the process and if he pulled out a spyglass and peered up at it, with his extra vision he could just barely make out a strange set of symbols upon it, and perhaps the flag of a kingdom? He couldn’t be sure, but what else he saw proved it was no mere bird up there. It was the ‘enemy’. An enemy that knew they were there. What that would entail he didn’t know, but he was worried, very worried.

He had good reason to be worried as well, as a cry went up from another vessel, and several of the sailors were pointing at something that was much closer to the water than that bird thing was. He followed their pointing fingers with his eyes and raised the spyglass again.

He saw the glinting of sunlight off six objects, six… such an oddly precise number. Such an… oh no. Though he held no love for the Hegemony, he could still find it in him to at least warn those around him.

“Get off the ship! Into the water, now!” He yelled, and leapt overboard. The others simply watched him land in the water, confusion and now fear in their eyes. What did he mean, why get off the ship. Nothing was happening except that thing in the sky. They were safe, and he was crazy.

The first cruise missile struck a ship right at its center. It broke, both halves thrust into the waves sideways from the force of the explosion, and then another and another hit. The crew and fresh recruits scrambled to either jump overboard while mages attempted to knock the weapons out of the sky with magic. But it was no use, nothing they did could stop the cold, unfeeling weapons of war from striking their targets and eliminating them.

In a matter of seconds, six ships began their long, slow journey to the bottom of the ocean.

– – – – – –

“Captain, all targets eliminated.”

“Well done gentlemen. Lower readiness condition and set course for the wreckage. Let’s see if we can’t fish anyone or anything useful out of the water.”

“Aye aye.”

And so the destroyer began to turn, barrelling towards the distant, burning wreckage of once proud vessels.

– – – – – –

Several hours later, the figure clung to a thick beam that floated in the frigid water. He was fairly certain he’d fail his mission now. How… how could they have such power? How could they reach out from beyond the horizon and swat them away so easily? Was this truly who he had been attempting to reach?

His ears heard voices then, amidst the crackling flames and weeping of anyone who’d survived. These voices were guttural, an almost barking tongue. From what the Gleaners had found amidst the not-she-elf’s mind and memories, this was something called English. They’d imparted its understanding to him before he’d left, and yet it took a moment to remember it, the cold was so all consuming.

“More survivors over here. Two in critical condition. We’re going to need more beds, sir.”

“Alright, cap’n says the Enterprise is sending choppers to pick up anyone we can’t take. They’ll be here in thirty. Let’s grab who we can and get out of here before any of them get funny ideas.”

He didn’t know what anything these people said meant, what was an Enterprise, choppers? Surely they wouldn’t be butchering the survivors, right? The beings on a small boat passed him, and one saw he was still alive, slapping something onto his back. He wanted to speak, to ask them to take him with them. But they just shook their heads, they already looked overloaded with other survivors.

But thirty minutes later there was a chopping, thwoomping sound from overhead, then splashes as people willingly jumped into the water from the sky. He felt hands on him, a harness placed around him and a voice in an ear.

“You’re alright! We’re gonna get you out of here and warmed up! Just hold on as tight as you can.”

He felt himself start to rise, as if some sort of divine hand had reached down and plucked him from that frigid water. But the air was no better, it whipped along and chilled him to the bone.

The next thing he knew he was being wrapped in a warm blanket, and there was a woman, yes, yes definitely a woman. She hovered over him, using strange tools to listen or shine a light in his eyes. He couldn’t understand the terminology she was using, it made no sense to him but she seemed worried. But she was pretty, like the elvish maiden he had once fell for quite hard.

“T-Take me… To your lord.” He hissed through chattering teeth, and produced a crystal ball from his coat.

A fair inverstigation would have been- would you like chicken salt, peri peri salt, or regular salt or no salt. To be honest, I don't think you get asked what kind of salt you want for your sweet potato chips- that is just so weird. 

Luckily the cook made me chips that were normal- no weird additional salt. 

I remember a former roommate who drank a lot of gin, ate salmon every night with chilli powder. I had no idea why. He would also cough incessantly after each meal, which was disgusting.

Now that I think about what I'm being accused of, I think he did drugs of some sort and lost his tastebuds. Salmon and chilli powder don't sound like an appetising combination either. He also drank a lot of coffee, and all the drug addicts I know, drink a lot of coffee.

DG: The History of the Military Invasion

In Dollet There Somewhere the Invasion of The Lunatic Pandora is nowadays still visible in the Régiment of the Force Majour Town where it is clearly to be seen for example in The Architecture of the Youngian Infrastructure for instance as how all the Buildings are looking out. The Red Brick Buildings share shape and size and have been rapped over with a thin layer of cement before painting with red and green.
   The Invasion took Place only 80 Years Ago but there's more to It because it has happened Sakes for About 100 Years Period of Time. Could this be explained as a contemplation of an apropos on two different Circles of Power urging their need to Gain Control qnd maintaining it over the Seas, in any way for a commoner?
   Noway the locals wanna hear about how the ""Moon Screamer"" may land their lots. Not the Old Fashioned people may talk about it without getting exhausted. Impossible it may be to explain a phrase without furtherly getting held forming anonymous point of view.
   This is How His Pen wrote an article for the newspaper in A Coffee Quarter where it was about a solid amount/quality relation of the bean. The place was about an atmosphere that belonged in An European Asphalt Jungle. It was quite the same as in Berlin and in Budapest. The only difference between these different Cities was as a matter of a fact the language barrier because the folks wouldn't intuitively understand english if You got tangled over the discourse like ""No speak english"" or ""No understand"". Lots and lots of people would be able to help any commoner around this barrier but of course the easiest way for a journeyman was just to ignore the ""Don't Speak"" and keep the quest ongoing.
   Laguna didn't mind the cold coffee cup that they would here in this hemisphere in between the area of the Youngian Arcitecture sort of Geographical Nature Inhabitant not only call A cups a-r-e cold, but aswell A cups will c-a-t-c-h cold.
   The People around this political surroundings that kept growing not just from the Town of Dollet or the two bigger Cities of Berlin and Budapest too from A Country to another They didn't mention That Brexit hadn't really removed the English Folklore from this Land Boris. The language was evrywhere to be seen like for example in the malls groceries labels and etiquettes as well as the public transportation guide and info. One could even hear it because the mainstream music had their lyrics written in english.

Dating friends is a coin flip depending on who I asked. Never befriend a woman just to date her and never date a woman without being friends with her first. Which one is right, which one is wrong?

I feel like my feelings and efforts are often dismissed. Looking at my family history, I was the most loved and spoiled child—my parents gave me everything. However, I believe my environment shaped me into who I am now, carrying the burden of being an INFJ malady. I always sacrifice my feelings to please others, give in, and put in 100% effort, even though, in the end, my efforts are ignored.

Throughout my life, I have only been in two long-term relationships—one lasted 7 years, and the other 5 years. In both relationships, I was always the one who backed down in confrontations. Even though I was incredibly loyal and never prioritized my own needs, I was still cheated on. I felt exhausted from constantly explaining my position just to be understood and loved. But the reality is, I am financially stable—I do not need their money, just love and understanding. Ridiculous!

I also remember one of my past relationships—I was with someone who was articulate and great at arguing. Every time we had a confrontation, I always lost in terms of ideas and subtle jabs. For me, subtle insults cut deeper than blunt words. In the end, all I could do was cry because I had no idea how to respond. But fortunately, that is all in the past now.

On top of that, my work environment been 7 years as a software engineer is full of pressure and constant demands from stakeholders who have no idea how difficult it is to develop an application. Even a single menu takes time to build, not to mention when I encounter bugs that do not have an immediate solution. I can go days without sleep. Always drink coffee everyday. And yet, what happens? Many stakeholders or users only throw harsh criticism or demand changes in an unrealistically short time, thinking it is easy. I have sacrificed my personal life and hobbies just to focus on the applications I develop, and I have to keep holding back my anger even though, deep down, I am completely broken.

That is why now I get triggered easily by people who throw subtle insults or do not care about my feelings. Honestly, I am afraid of interacting with people and dealing with unhealthy confrontations. It is a curse being an INFJ, right? I feel like I am so easy to manipulate or bully, and I do not even know how to react when I suddenly feel angry. 

So, how to heal this ? it sounds hard for me tbh. I drink coffee during the day and sleeping pills at night just wanna to have ‘some’ rest, although it doesn’t really help hahaha.",1,1739964738.0,infj,2,1.0,False

They do have a lot in common. They’re both musicians. They have similar tastes in music  and other things. This girl was introduced to our friend group several months ago and my partner started having a conversation w her w/o knowing her age or anything about her. This conversation happened on discord and was not an irl meeting. They talked for a long time before she found out her age. 
We are in an open relationship and she and I are both happy with that. We don’t want exclusivity and we have deep conversations and communicate honestly and openly about the other women we sleep with. 
Fast forward to a month ago and I was offered a night time shift(9pm-5:30am) and accepted because of the pay increase and our current financial situation. This has been a mistake and I regret it immensely. It has definitely created a rift in our relationship and we’ve tried to make do so far.

She asked if we could have her over for dinner Monday evening and we talked about what our intentions were and I wanted to make sure she felt comfortable and safe with her lesbian aunties and if she ever needed a safe space, she would know our home was available to her. We agreed upon that and I expressed that I did not want her to be intimate with this person. She acknowledged and promised she wouldn’t. I cooked dinner for us and the evening went well. I got ready for work and headed off feeling really good about our stated goal. 
I crash after getting home from work and wake up to coffee and cuddles just like always. 
Halfway through my first cup she tells me that they had sex and how sorry she is about it. I went numb immediately. Went to our bathroom and just cried. This is the first time this has happened in our near two year relationship. I don’t know what to do or think. I’ve asked if she still wants to be intimate with her and she says yes. Even though I’ve asked her not to be.

Yes, I have been diagnosed with depression, but after reading some of the posts here sometimes I start to question if it is depression or something else. I have never thought about killing myself so is the following really depression? And if it is, I appreciate ANYthing that is to be said (not necessarily help because nothing is helping me). 

My problem is that I feel so down ALL the time. Literally no mood or motivation to do anything in life. No energy or motivation to clean my room/ take the trash out, take a shower, go to the gym, work, write a reddit post...etc.

I got so lucky that I got a job as a boss in an electronic workshop (the old boss was retiring), so as a boss nobody observes what I'm doing and I'm alone in my office room feeling so down and lacking any desire to work on any task that is given to me, yet that doesn't matter because I work at a university so it is basically working with the goverment (not like working in a compamy) which means my deadlines are so loose and I can postpone however I like.

I also feel so emotionally needy that I installed 3 dating apps and payed for multiple subscriptions/boosts but I literally get 0 likes or matches. My pics are just me smiling in front of a river or a building (no activities or sports) which I have been told it doesn't make girls so interested. Some might say well do some sports/ take pics of you being active but I feel that I'm simply paralyzed by my mental illness. I can't do sports nor do I have the energy or the mood to change anything about me. I once (and only once) talked with a hot girl on a dating app and she kept sending me voice messages that I thought it was not a scam and I noticed a significant improvement in my mood, however 3 days later she asked me to invest in financial markets so I blocked her. 

I know that trying to get in a relationship  a bad reason to get out of low mood and I know no girl would want to get in a relationship with a depressed man but I keep insisting on doing so, as I am desperately looking for a way to improve my mood (no sense I know). 

I spend my day in the office watching live streams of League of Legends, drinking coffee all the time, scrolling through bumble or others hopelessly and desperately. I struggle to do the smallest tasks and even reading some posts here about depressed people is a hard thing to do for me. I get highly overwhelmed by any new task that I get in my workplace. I have tried to do small steps at a time but it doesn't always help. 

I have been to psychiatrists for 3/4 years and been on zoloft 200 mg but it ain't helping shit. Mood in the dumpster and overwhelming feelings all the time. 

This must be depression right? Even without suicidal thoughts or feeling sad? Even if it is, I appreciate anything that you guys would like to comment about my situation, which doesn't need to be helping comments, as medication is not helping, I struggle to do even anything to help myself and I have completely given up on my situation getting better or changed. For example you want to share something similar or talk about your problem it is appreciable because it makes me feel I am not alone and makes it easier for me to see other people struggling. If you want to help I appreciate it but I don't think anything will help me.

For some back story, I've been waiting for almost a year to be seen by a urologist. I've had problem with frequent bladder infections and UTIs most of my life. I've also had a lot of issues with having all the symptoms of a uti and not having infections. I constantly have bladder spasms(my lower tummy feels like it's vibrating). Last year I was treated for ureaplasma and the last test I had said I was negative for it so i thought things would get better. My primary told me that the problems sounded like ic. I have an aunt that has ic but she has a lot of symptoms that I don't have such as incontinence and extreme pain. I definitely have pain but i honestly feel like I have a pretty high pain tolerance. One thing I've noticed in the last year or two is that I have a fishy smell. I've been tested and treated so many times for bv and yeast and it never goes away. Ive also been tested for stds and its all negative as well. When I first started having issues I thought that it was just frequent vaginal Infections or utis. But the longer I deal with it the burning isn't my vagina, it's my urethra. And the smell isn't from my vagina. Tmi but I've inserted a finger in there and it smells like nothing. 
So long story short, does anyone that deals with ic have issues with smelling fishy? My pee sometimes smells like it, or it will smell like really strong coffee for the day or just like idk really just funky. I shower every day and I wash with unscented aveeno, but if I'm having a lot of burning I will just wash with water. The fishy smell always comes back though. I feel like I'm going crazy with  this and hoping that the urologist I'm supposed to see can help me with this.

My friends and I will be visiting Barcelona in the middle of March (14-16). 

We’re a group of 8/9 people in our early/mid 30s and are in need of suggestions for what area and neighbourhood to stay in.

We’ve all been to you your lovely city before and have visited the “must see” (tourist) places. As nice as they are, we’re not into touristy spots, with thousands of loud people, bachelor parties, drunk Brits and tourist traps offering highly priced and average (at best) servings. 

What we’re looking for out of our weekend is a getaway to relax and indulge into good food and beverages. As cringe as it may sound, I’m talking about hip areas with:
- cosy cocktail places where the bartenders actually care what they serve and are passioned about mixology;
- nice (preferably smaller) restaurants with signature dishes that make you want to go back to Barcelona just to have that “one thing”;
- streets that are lively but not overcrowded, with interesting (vintage, record) shops, good coffee places, brunch spots and nice overall vibes when going for a walk. 

I’m giving the following areas for reference, for people who have lived/visited:
- Amsterdam - Jordaan District & de Pijp 
- Berlin - Friedrichshain
- New York - Lower East Side

From my Reddit research, such areas might be Eixample and maybe El Born (close to the Gothic Quarter)?

We will be renting an Airbnb and so if someone has an appropriate place, do hit me up pls.

But when the trailer for SOTE dropped the FOMO finally took me and I hopped on in hoping to beat the original game before the DLC. To then learn that apparently I did not need to do that but I went to do that anyway because it felt wonky without and I didn't want to miss any context for when I entered the DLC.

Anyway to get straight to the point: It's interesting that a lot of characters from the
golden lineage have appearances that have match some IRL genetic abnormalities having to do with the X and Y chromosome. Queen Marika's condition of sharing her body with Radagon in particular strikes me as having parallels with XXY syndrome, or XY individuals living with mild to complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Both results in someone who is very tall, has large hands, skin troubles, wider hips, poor beard growth and tig ol biddy. There are usually also some other phenotypical traits, but cases very and the syndrome can also manifest due to genetic mosaicism where one person can have both 47XXY/46XY.

But for the degree of feminization seen ingame, an androgen insensitivity seems like it would be a necessity. It'd also mean that although she might look normal any children could be receiving only a single X chromosome from her depending on the way the dominos fell. People can live with just one X chromosome though, and this is called Turner syndrome, where somebody might either have a single X chromosome, Barbie another mosaic living with XO/XY, but that XY kind of just chills back doing nothing. The defining symptom of Turner syndrome is looking like a child forever, even into adulthood.

In terms of personality, those with XXY tend to be shy in their youth but many experience mood dysregulation, judgment that isn't so good and low distress tolerance with less ability to pay attention than most others. However none of this stops someone from having a successful career.

Please do note that this isn't some kind of ""woke"" tumblrista post snuffling around crazily for ""representation"" but observation. I'm a writer so sometimes there's bleedover.
Given that I'm not acquainted enough with the lore iitself to speculate, I'm not going to try and guess anything off of that alone. But I'd say Messmer also is an interesting parallel to a guy living with an extra Y chromosome. Men with this condition tend to be taller then average, have large hands, poor muscle tone and flat feet and are often afflicted with scoliosis. It is just called Superman or Jacob's syndrome because I guess double the y chromosome and you wind up a little tall. My first thought was of the Roman-looking aesthetic and stories about the mythical chimera, A creature that is part snake, which is what sent me down this hole to begin with. But however do qknow that most individuals with Jacob's syndrome do not exhibit any clinical traits.

When I play most games I usually don't give a rat's ass about the story and I just Esc+Enter every cutscene that I can, but this one is different for some reason. I'm probably going to edit this and truncate it once I have had my coffee and my morning nap because it's literally only about 6:00 a.m. for me, but I wanted to get this off my chest before I forgot.

EDIT - also note that in the past, I've tested my fasting blood glucose after coffee, and there was no change so I'm confident my glucose in unaffected, but I'm concerned about it changing insulin levels significantly over time to impact my A1c. ",1,1739964020.0,InsulinResistance,1,1.0,False

1it34k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1it34k3/my_34m_gf_35f_dislikes_my_female_friends_but/,My (34M) Gf (35F) dislikes my female friends but maybe it's something deeper?,"Hi all. So, we've been together for **two years**, and since the start, I’ve been **open and proud** of my friendships. We both seemed aware of what shaped us into who we are today, including the people present in our lives.

Both of us have friends of **all genders and walks of life**. For context, my girlfriend is bi—not something that has ever been a factor in who I date, just something to mention. I also realised that I’ve never dated someone who **wasn’t bi**, but that’s never been a preference or something I actively look for—it’s just how things have turned out.

# My Friendships & Background

I’ve always tried to be **transparent** about the people who are important to me—how long I’ve known them and why they matter. Names and subtle hints of what makes them good people, safe to be around, etc. I feel **lucky** that I still have friends from **2004, 2005, 2009, etc.** While my social circle is **smaller now**, I used to be very outgoing—actively looking for like-minded people.

* **Back in the day**, I was the typical **goth kid outcast**, but I was lucky to find other goths and form connections lol.
* I was **very online**, chatting with people when it still felt like a novelty, and I met some **great friends** that way. Haven't spoken to some of them in years, would be sweet to say hi, it wouldn't seem weird to me.
* Over time, I naturally had **friendships that evolved into something romantic**. Those people **aren’t in my life anymore**.
* When things ended, I prioritised **closure**—sometimes it was a tough lesson (poor boundaries on my end, high school breakups, girls who wanted to date me while dating someone else 'officially', or me wanting to search for interactions without further involvement; not like hookups or anything, I've never liked anything physical so quickly, but online it felt safer which I eventually learned it wasn't healthy and I was instead ignoring things I had to improve in myself, etc.), but I moved on.

I also dislike keeping **past romantic interests** in my life because, to me, it would feel like I’m holding onto something that **shouldn’t be there**. A sort of backdoor that shouldn't be there. I don’t like **giving someone power** over me in that way (someone in the past was extremely manipulative, diagnosed NPD). I’ve also had **bad experiences** with people who seemed to keep many others close **for entertainment, validation, backup options**, or just to **exercise their attractiveness**. You know, that kind of situation that isn't even about oneself or one's attractiveness, but their constant need to feel desired, etc.

# My Current Friendships & My Girlfriend’s Concerns

By the time I met my girlfriend, I knew I was **fully emotionally available**. None of my **current** female friends have ever been romantic interests, and I’ve never **sought** them in that way.

* I have **three female friends**, but I **rarely** see them because they’ve moved away, two of them have awesome partners, and life has gotten busy.
* These friendships developed **as part of a larger group when we were teenagers**—we would party, hang out, sit in the grass talking, etc. No drinking or anything wild.
* One of these friends even **dated one of my best male friends**, and we all used to go out together in a completely **wholesome, platonic way** (going to the store, watching movies, etc.). On busy days it was super nice to know I could see friends for a bit before returning to work, little stuff like that. I think things like this strengthen so many core values like better fluency when interacting, confidence, sharing what each of us was up to at the time, interests, people we were dating, you know.
* Over the years, we’ve all had relationships, **broken up, dated other people, and moved on**. It’s never felt like there was any **attraction** between us. At least not on my end.

# What Happened Recently?

It was **my birthday** recently, and one of these **long-time female friends** posted:

1. A **story of us** with a caption: *""Happy birthday, love you so much 🎂.""*
2. A meme of **two rats dancing** (caption: *""My bestie and I after telling each other the most horrible trauma, etc.""*).

I immediately felt a bit **anxious** because a few months ago, my **girlfriend and I argued** about this same friend.

# Backstory of That Argument:

* This friend had been in a **bad car accident** and suffered **neck injuries**.
* After months of healing, she was finally feeling well enough to **go out again**, so she started meeting up with her friends and posting **selfies with them** (something she does a lot, on their bdays too, with the same word choice and all).
* We met up for **coffee** and took a **picture together**, which she posted and tagged me in. I reshared it.
* My **girlfriend didn’t like that**—she said it **looked inappropriate** and made it seem like I was **doing something questionable** with another girl when I’m in a relationship. I've done this in the past when I hung out with other friends, before my relationship, and I really feel like the visible language or tone in a picture can really display a healthy hangout that should perhaps not be confused with a date. I believe I'm mindful of that and it was puzzling to think it felt so wrong to her.

That hurt because I **genuinely don’t have** any romantic feelings for this friend. But I also **want to take my girlfriend’s concerns seriously**, so I started wondering:

* Could my friend be **subtly overstepping** boundaries?
* Is there an **unspoken social signal** here that I’m missing?

# Possible Explanations?

I’ve seen people talk about situations like this, and I’m wondering if my girlfriend sees it through one of these lenses:

* **Unconscious Partner-Seeking Behaviour:**
   * When a guy is seen as *""just a friend""* to other women, it can **subconsciously** make him seem **less desirable** as a romantic partner.
* **Power Dynamics in Friendships:**
   * The idea that a female friend might **assert social power** by being openly affectionate or **playfully dominant**.
   * It could make it seem like I’m **allowing myself to be ""tamed""** or influenced by someone else’s energy.
* **Implied Romantic Interest:**
   * Even if nothing has ever happened, it might **give off a certain appearance**, making it seem like there’s **some unresolved tension or waiting game**.

# Other Concerns in Our Relationship

* I barely text people when I'm in front of my gf—mostly my **mum and sister** when necessary, and I provide context or clarity so it doesn't come across as rude.
* I **rarely** go out with friends anymore, either because **I’m tired or schedules don’t align**. But I must confess I hesitate to take the initiative to see a female friend anymore because I feel uncomfortable, which makes me sad.
* When I **do** talk to friends, it’s **mostly just sending memes**. Guy friends, or female friends, we don't always go into depth and honestly we're all very tired lol so I do engage in a deeper convo sometimes but it's rare, and my time with gf isn't compromised, so it's not like I'm text while next to her and ignoring or anything.
* My female friends **respect my relationship, or so I think**—they don’t **call me randomly** or **interrupt my time** with my girlfriend. So it has never ever interrupted time or felt like my time must be shared with that friend.
* Some of them even suggest **double dates** or **group outings**, which feels like a healthy way to maintain friendships. And they've asked more than once but I've noticed they stopped suggesting it.

However, I know my girlfriend **has felt uncomfortable before**.

# Example of Misunderstanding:

* One time, I had **Instagram open**, and a few **DM notifications** were visible.
* My girlfriend sat next to me while I was working, and I instinctively **hesitated before switching tabs** (to make sure it didn’t look weird).
* That hesitation **made it look worse**, and she later told me she thought I was **hiding something**.
* The messages were:
   * A **condolence reply** to a **high school classmate** whose **grandmother passed away**. With no convo history lol.
   * A **career advice conversation** with a **friend looking for job opportunities**—I was just sharing helpful websites. I've helped other friends and they've landed the jobs they had, I honestly think this is good and I cherish that friendship anyways. A lot.

I leave my phone unlocked, she knows my password, and I always **leave it in front of her** when I step away. I want her to feel secure**.** She has expressed no interest in taking a look at my phone or anything like that and I've expressed appreciation and transparency.

# Where I’m Struggling

I miss my friends. I **don’t** see them often, but when I do, I don’t want to feel like I’m **doing something wrong**.

I value **loyalty**. I’ve been **cheated on before**, and I would **never** do that to someone. What I have with my girlfriend is **meaningful**, and I see **a future with her**. And that takes tons of effort and commitment, and I just don't see any point in ruining things when I'm deeply invested.

But I also **don’t understand** why my friendships **feel like an issue** when I’ve done nothing to suggest I’m unfaithful.

I appreciate perspectives like:

* **The School of Life’s take on friendship** and how being *""just friends""* is a **rich** and **valuable** thing. We can even be ""our most disappointing selves"", etc.
* **Esther Perel’s insights** on cheating and relationships.

I just don’t know how to **fully apply** those ideas to my situation. I want to **respect her feelings** without **sacrificing my friendships**.

# TL;DR:

* I have **long-time female friends** who I rarely see.
* My **girlfriend is uncomfortable** with these friendships, especially when they post about me (literally something that's happened like 4 times total over the past 2.5 years, bday photos, memories, nothing suggestive).
* I **don’t think I’ve done anything wrong**, but I also **don’t want to invalidate her feelings**.
* I want to **balance keeping my friendships** without **causing her distress**.
* How do I **navigate this?**",1,1739963728.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1it341r,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1it341r/is_it_normal_for_bookclubs_to_be_so_expensive/,Is it normal for Bookclubs to be so expensive?,"So I recently found a book club at this indie book shop that was sorta close that I’d never been too online. I had heard of them doing events for major book releases previously and decided I’d read this particular book they were reading for this month since it was a popular dark romance and I was curious. When signing up it just asked if you had the book yes or no and at the time I didn’t. So I went out and purchased the book elsewhere. Read it enjoyed it and was ready to go to this event. 

When the day came I pulled up and had to sign in. The guy asked if I had the book and I said yea but then asked if I purchased it from them. So of course I said no which he then told me in order to join there book clubs I had to buy it from them and that was my ticket in but no where was this stated online. They also have a log to verify if you’ve actually bought from them. So he told me I would have to either buy the book again or buy another of equal value and this book was already 19 dollars Because according to them it was to pay for the snacks which was cheese, crackers and strawberries that I would have surely indulged in if I’d known I was paying for it. There was probably 30 of us in there considering they said it was there biggest book club yet 

I spent well over 50 dollars for two books and a coffee just to be apart of this book club and the next one. This doesn’t include the price I paid for my original copy. Is this normal to spend that much? Not to mention the alternative book that I bought was met with criticism when I was being rung up because another girl at the counter didn’t like the author or something. Meanwhile it was the only thing I could get my hands on that was of equal value since they only have 4 bookshelves of books. Like I get indie shops need all the support they can get but for it being my first time I felt blind sighted. ",19,1739963676.0,books,55,0.72,False

1it2z8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1it2z8b/20242025_stats_mostly_bkk/,2024-2025 Stats (Mostly BKK),"I've collected data from 2022 on my budget, expenses, health (kilometers walked, AQI in the city), and accommodation (price, rating, type of accommodation, etc.). My data from 24-25 compared with 22-25 is more comprehensive, as I didn't have my individual transactions until 2024 so I'm only reporting for the last year. 

***Quick background:*** Not a traditional dn, I took an extended sabbatical (2022-2024), then found work as a science teacher in the last year and have quite a bit of time off for going around southeast Asia and east Asia, but nonetheless this may help the DN community.

  
Most of my time was spent in Thailand in the last year, so there is a high skew of this being located in Bangkok, but I've also included the other locations. 

I have 2 other charts in progress on:

* Accommodations (2022-2025)
* Flights (2022-2025)

It's not perfect, and **yes there are some errors I haven't fixed yet** but it demonstrates some interesting personal insights on where I've spent my time. So below is a chart that displays where I walked the most on a daily basis. On the right I sorted by lowest pollution / AQI on the days that I stayed in those regions. 

[Most time being spent in Bangkok, geographical chart and data table showing my average km walked daily, and AQI. ](https://preview.redd.it/wutxtjmun2ke1.jpg?width=1875&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cc9787d6dc9555879ef9350fa7000323c611808)

  
This one below is on my budget and expenses from 2024-2025. **Don't be too shocked by the amount spent if it seems low, because I haven't accounted for accommodations or flights in this figure,** which would most likely add a **significant ($$$) amount!** Ill try to detail that in my accommodations and flights charts. My two largest expenses in daily life are on food and coffee, so I put those into a chart on their own. Japan, not surprisingly, had the highest private transit (combination of Shikansen and private bus companies). I could pull some more interesting insights from my data on breakdowns of categorical expenses, average daily cost, etc. but I couldn't fit much more on this display.

[My coffee budget rivals my food budget in most countries in SEA, About 75&#37; percent of my transactions come from cash and 25&#37; from credit cards, my average daily transaction amount is $3.37.](https://preview.redd.it/xghdevevo2ke1.jpg?width=1875&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a75229bf46c40571ec1b31c768defa0a34eea874)

  
I know these have errors and aren't perfect (and a relatively small data set). I am still learning. But it could drive interesting discussion on lifestyle in SEA/East Asia. ",7,1739963155.0,digitalnomad,2,1.0,False

1it2sol,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfHouston/comments/1it2sol/rad_center_rant/,RAD Center Rant,"This is a really long post btw but it could definitely be longer with the amount of issues I’ve had at the RAD.

First and foremost, I am a freshman here, who lives on campus and has the base meal plan like many other people. I get that for a lot of people, specifically commuters, the RAD is a good option to grab lunch before or after class and before heading back home, so I understand this doesn’t apply to a lot of people, but in my experience, there is always a problem when I visit. The handling of the RAD has been awful. From the staff, to the space and even the food has truly been disappointing. 

It’s unfortunate that despite the building having had two grand openings, the one large room upstairs is still unfinished, the patio is always locked when there’s nice weather, and every seat is taken on both levels most hours of the day, forcing many people to sit on the ground of the empty space that still has no tables and chairs despite how long the RAD has been open. UH, why is “phase 3” of the building not finishing until this summer? It will almost be a whole year since its opening for a couple small spaces that I assume shouldn’t take a whole summer to complete. 

It’s unfortunate that almost every time my friends and I go to the Nook to grab coffee, one of our orders is canceled several minutes after being placed on Grubhub with no notice of a drink being out of stock beforehand, prompting me to go on a guessing game of re ordering several times before I find a drink that both looks good and is actually able to be made before I finally get to wait the long time it takes to be prepared. Yes, I could get in line and order there, but there are only two workers manning the station, and one of them is always multi tasking taking orders and working on orders, leading to a long line and prolonged drink preparing.

It’s unfortunate some workers, specifically absurd bird workers always seem out of it and frequently have some issue when I order and give dirty looks from time to time. Which reminds me, I have caught some of the workers not washing their hands in the bathroom as well. And it sucks that the chicken at absurd bird is either hit or miss, but it’s never worth ordering when the next day you have the worst experience on the toilet of your life, especially if you get it spicy, so you end up going to chick fil a instead, which is a whole other problem when there’s always quite literally 40 people in line. Same with paper lantern, I have yet to try it but why try it when I know Panda Express is the same type of option on campus that I know is decent. 

It’s unfortunate that the last time my friends and I ordered a burrito from the taco stand, they had to wait an extra 25 minutes because they were out of ingredients and had to get/cook more. And it really sucks when the workers prepare the food extremely slow to make my burrito and don’t fold it correctly so when it comes out the wrapper it falls apart and I have to go back to ask for a fork. 

It’s unfortunate the only burger option (other than the den) on campus costs at least $16 for a meal and if you were to be in the mood for a plain shake, it’s another $7 added to your meal. This option is somehow more costly than the notoriously expensive shake shack. And when you’re presented with your meal, you’re never able to finish the whole thing because it’s the largest burger and most fries you’ve ever seen at a establishment because the portions are so large you end up never finishing it. Don’t even think about going to the McDonald’s next to campus because it’s both much further and a contender for the worst location in the state of Texas.

It’s unfortunate that my personal biggest gripe of all is something as simple as the hours the RAD is open. The RAD is open from 10:30 am to 7pm Monday through Thursday, Fridays they close at 3PM… and they’re CLOSED on the weekends. Because of the sucky hours, you are always going during lunch hours no matter what unless you want lunch for breakfast, early dinner or coffee. If you aren’t using a meal swipe, you could go between 11am and 2 pm. Guess what? It only gets progressively busy during those hours. If you want to wait for the RAD to get less busy, you can’t wait because after 2 pm everyone who uses a meal swipe or eats lunch at a reasonable time is showing up. So really if you don’t want a crowd you have to go at 4 or 5pm for a very late lunch or a very early dinner. Speaking of dinner, you can never eat dinner at the RAD because they close at 7PM most days. UH, if you want the RAD to be more successful, all you have to do is leave it open for at least one more hour and people will go not just for lunch but also for dinner at around 7PM, potentially spreading the crowd throughout the day. This includes Friday’s. I will never understand how both Moody and the RAD close so early Friday’s, you are forced to eat lunch before 2 when everyone else has the same idea before it closes for the WHOLE WEEKEND. UH, you have several food options locked behind doors for most of Friday and all of Saturday and Sunday, please explain to me why that is a sensible decision. UH, your students who stay on campus are forced to walk half a mile usually after sunset to either cougar woods, the student center which never has all food options open on the weekends, or an off campus option for both lunch and dinner, and the off campus options nearby are all low quality with the trip it takes being as we know dangerous right now especially at night. UH, PLEASE have the RAD open for longer and on the weekends, I feel like you are waisting potential revenue on the RAD you just spend millions on. 

Maybe I’m reaching, or maybe it’s really not that serious, but every point I’ve made is a dumb issue I’ve personally faced that just seems to make my day a little worse and sometimes makes my trip to the RAD pointless. I understand the workers are likely from a 3rd party company like the Panda Express and chick fil a and I understand it may be hard on them. But everyone has to eat, I pay tuition, I pay for a meal plan, I sometimes spend money out of my own pocket to eat there, I wish it were as easy as simply and quickly ordering a fair meal and sitting down in the RAD. It feels like all of the trips never go that way and always have some issue. I’m simply curious if I’m not the only one with these problems and experiences.",3,1739962473.0,UniversityOfHouston,2,1.0,False

Vanilla is one of the most sought-after flavors in the world, used in everything from baking to beverages. Among all varieties, [vanilla extract from Madagascar](https://robustmadagascar.com/products/vanilla/) stands out as the gold standard for its rich, creamy, and complex flavor profile. The fertile soil and ideal climate of Madagascar create the perfect environment for growing high-quality vanilla beans. This blog will explore why vanilla extract from Madagascar is the best choice, its production process, benefits, and how Robust Madagascar ensures premium quality.

**1. Why Madagascar Produces the Best Vanilla Extract**

**1.1 Ideal Climate and Soil Conditions**

Madagascar has the perfect tropical climate with high humidity, warm temperatures, and well-drained soil. These factors contribute to the slow and natural curing process of vanilla beans, allowing them to develop deep, rich flavors. The island's eastern region, especially Sava, is known as the ""vanilla capital of the world,"" producing over 80% of the world's vanilla supply.

**1.2 Traditional Cultivation Methods**

Farmers in Madagascar follow traditional methods to cultivate and hand-pollinate vanilla orchids. Since natural pollination is rare, skilled farmers carefully pollinate each flower by hand, ensuring high-quality vanilla pods. This labor-intensive process is one of the reasons why vanilla extract from Madagascar is highly valued.

**1.3 Unique Flavor Profile**

The vanilla beans from Madagascar have a creamy, sweet, and slightly woody taste with hints of caramel. This distinct profile makes them ideal for both sweet and savory dishes. Unlike synthetic vanilla, which lacks depth, Madagascar vanilla provides a rich and authentic flavor.

**1.4 Sustainable Farming Practices**

To maintain the quality of vanilla production, many farmers follow sustainable farming methods. These practices protect the environment and ensure that vanilla cultivation remains a long-term, viable industry. Robust Madagascar works closely with local farmers to promote sustainable and ethical vanilla farming.

**2. How Vanilla Extract Is Made in Madagascar**

**2.1 Harvesting at the Right Time**

The best vanilla beans are harvested when they reach full maturity, which takes about nine months. If picked too early, the beans do not develop the desired flavor. Farmers carefully inspect each pod before harvesting to ensure only the best beans are selected.

**2.2 Curing and Fermentation**

Once harvested, the beans go through a lengthy curing process. They are first blanched in hot water, then wrapped in blankets to sweat and ferment. Over several weeks, the beans develop their rich aroma and characteristic dark brown color.

**2.3 Drying and Aging**

After fermentation, the beans are spread out in the sun to dry for several weeks. This slow-drying process enhances the flavor concentration. After drying, the beans are aged for months, allowing the flavors to mature and deepen.

**2.4 Extraction Process**

To produce vanilla extract from Madagascar, the dried and aged beans are soaked in a mixture of alcohol and water. This process extracts the natural vanillin and other aromatic compounds, resulting in a high-quality vanilla extract with an intense and complex flavor. Robust Madagascar ensures that their extraction process retains all the natural richness of the vanilla beans.

**3. Benefits of Using Madagascar Vanilla Extract**

**3.1 Rich and Authentic Flavor**

One of the main reasons Madagascar vanilla is preferred worldwide is its deep, creamy, and sweet flavor. It enhances the taste of desserts, beverages, and even savory dishes.

**3.2 High Vanillin Content**

Madagascar vanilla beans have a high concentration of vanillin, the compound responsible for the characteristic vanilla taste. This makes the extract more flavorful and aromatic compared to other varieties.

**3.3 Versatile Ingredient**



 is widely used in baking, ice cream, coffee, cocktails, and even skincare products. Its versatility makes it a must-have ingredient for home bakers and professional chefs alike.

**3.4 Health Benefits**

Pure vanilla extract contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. It is also known to have calming effects, making it a popular ingredient in aromatherapy and wellness products.

**4. Why Choose Robust Madagascar for the Best Vanilla Extract**

**4.1 Commitment to Quality**

Robust Madagascar sources the finest vanilla beans and follows strict quality control measures. Their vanilla extract is free from artificial additives, ensuring an all-natural product with an authentic taste.

**4.2 Ethical and Sustainable Sourcing**

1it2o7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1it2o7j/hr_letterbox/,[HR] Letterbox,"I feel trapped.

The room I’m in isn’t well ventilated at all, it stinks. 

If I remain perfectly still, the smell starts to fade, but the second I readjust in my crappy camping chair a waft of warm cheesy shit hits my nostrils.

I bet if someone walked in they’d just collapse and die, not even time for a gag.

*My name is Ben and I am become death… via pot noodle and body odour.* 

I take a look down at my feet for just a second, a small circle has formed around the base of the chair. I’m sitting on my own isolated island, whilst the debris of a week’s worth of watching builds up around me. 

The window in front of me has the blinds pulled down, I’ve cut out a section as I usually do and built a flimsy looking view port out of card and tape. It does the job. No light escapes, and I get a perfect view across the road. If she happened to look straight up at my window it would just be dark venetians staring back. 

My schedule is interesting. I watch the door sixteen hours per day, and sleep the other eight. Oh, I meant uninteresting, slip of the tongue. 

For those blissful unconscious periods my digital eyes take over, I can’t afford to miss any comings or goings. 

Basically, right here, right now, sitting quarantined on an island surrounded by my own filth, I am the god that looks down upon you. Well only if you live in 29b on the High Street. Other than that I’m nobody.

So sitrep then (*Situation Report*, I read a lot of Andy McNab books). No one has come or gone for a few days now, Jennings went in with a few bags of shopping and a strange look on her face. Like she was doing a really tough maths question.

Other than that, barely a postman has given it a sniff. (I’ll come on to that). 

I’ll have to move soon, time is ticking. Ensure she’s in, pop over and that will be that.

Nodding to myself, I flick a toe at the kettle and it starts to boil. The water is a few days old, so it adds a sense of cardboard to the pot noodle, but it’s perfectly fine.  

My watch emits a quiet bleep. It’s one o’clock. I don’t tend to watch anything on TV when I’m watching a target but the News is riveting at the moment. It’s captured my attention more than it should. I stick the phone to the top of my view port and keep one eye on it.

The *Letterbox Fiddler*, I’m hooked to be honest. Someone is going round, knocking on letterboxes, like back in the day when your mates knocked for you. Except now, when you answer the door, well you’re murdered. 

The obvious question when I first saw it on the News was ‘well how do they know it’s the same person?’ 

The calling card, of course. Every serial killer has one. The *Zodiac Killer* had his funny little puzzles. *Jack the Ripper*, well, ripped. And the *Night Stalker* drew pentagrams everywhere he went. 

The *Letterbox Fiddler?* All very tame really. They only cut your tongue out and stick it to the back of your letterbox, so when the postman delivers they get a nice lick. Horrific isn’t it? Anyway, like I say I’m hooked.    

 He, or it could be a she I guess, well THEY have killed three women and one bloke in a few weeks. The country is in spasm over it, the News has to report on it of course but I think they end up just feeding into the hysteria.

Every single report is an escalation. Serious looking police officers getting increasingly more terse giving way to clips of local people gaffer taping up their letterboxes. Imagine that, people’s response is to put their fingers in their ears. *If they can’t clang the letter box they can’t get me.* 

The News is dull today. Old *Fiddles* hasn’t killed anyone else, and it was just more of the same bollocks on how to detect if you’re about to be murdered. Basically, don’t answer the door is all they can advise.

Shit, maybe she won’t answer when I pop round. Fuck sake, imagine that, the perfect stake out ruined by a psychopath with a kink for the post. 

Oh, movement. We have something. Yawn, it’s the postman, I think he’s delivering to a few of the doors in their little cluster. 29b presumably has a 29a, maybe even a 29c, a 29d would be ridiculous of course. But then we have numbers 1-28 to deal with as well, some serious efficiency gains for that postman if he can shed a bunch of mail in one place. Do postmen get measured on productivity like that? Steps per Letter? Expected Post per Door? 

*Fuck, I really need to get out of here.* 

I forgot about my pot noodle in the excitement of the News and this postman. Quick re-boil and we’re all good to go. 

Christ, I slopped it all down me, the pot in which the noodle was contained buckling under the re-heating. If I was a dick I’d write a letter to them, get a full claim going. Alas, I am a lovely person and will just let it go. 

I needed to clean myself up, I say clean, I mean rub a few wet wipes down my front and trousers, but in the excitement, I’ve missed something. A light has pinged on in 29b, and a blind has come down over the window. 

So she’s been in this flat for a few days and finally now she does something. What if she’s getting ready to go out? If she’s out all night then I miss my window. No, I need to get this done before the weekend or I fail. 

I’m going to have to go over and do it now. Pretend to be a confused food delivery driver or something. She opens the door, and bam, jobs done. 

I quickly pack up all my stuff: wet wipes, viewing port, three remaining pot noodles and my fold away chair. I’m ashamed to admit that little exertion has left me panting. 

Heading down the stairs, I open the front door. Always one of the most jarring aspects of my job is that change of perspective. 

I spend a week up there with a fixed angle on my target, then I come down to street level and it’s like entering a brave new world. 

I scout around, the street is fairly quiet, there isn’t much around here so that’s to be expected. The postman has gone, can’t see him.  

I walk across the road as if I’m just going for a stroll, hands deep in pockets.

At the door now, there’s a panel with the handwritten numbers and names. I was right, there is a 29a and 29c, but no 29d. Ms Jennings 29b sits there, lit up like a Christmas tree. I press it, nothing. Come on Beth. How big can her flat be? Maybe she’s in the bath. Might explain the light and the blind going down. 

I press it again, and still nothing. I’m about to grab the handle and pull it when I’m saved by the postman. I do that funny under the breath talking blokes do when they’re holding doors open for one another. 

‘Cheers mate.’ 

He just nods and smiles. 

I’m in. Okay this should be a doddle, I’ll get Beth out of the bath, do the deed, and be on my way. 

29b is to the right as you enter on the ground floor. I stand there and ready myself. It’s all in the delivery.

My opening line floats around my head, I try out different cadences and tones under my breath.

‘Hi are you Beth, Beth Jennings?’ said as if it were a first date.

‘Beth Jennings?’ Now I’m a policeman and there’s been a death in the family.

‘Oh, sorry, Beth is it? Jennings?’ I’m here to tell you about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. 

I plump for the first, and ready the end of my dialogue. 

‘You’ve been served.’

She’s been dodging the summons for months, so of course they brought in the very best. Most process servers think it’s about bumping into someone in a park, or thrusting a wad of paper at people in a coffee shop. 

No, I find the best way to get the people who can’t be got is to simply observe. Study them long enough and then get them where they think they are safest. 

Beth Jennings, your time is up.

I knock. I wait. 

Nothing happens, so I knock and wait some more. 

I grunt a little, I hate to be stood up. She’s in here, I know she’s in here, I saw her come in and she hasn’t left. 

I’m about to knock for a third time when I happen to look down. 

A letterbox. 

I start to laugh, that would be too perfect right now. I ping her letterbox and she climbs out the bathroom window thinking I’m the *Fiddler*. 

Still, I can take a look through it I guess. See what the hell is going on in there that’s keeping her from the door. 

I bend down after glancing around. No one else about, I hope it stays that way. I stink, am covered in pot noodle and am fiddling with a lady’s letterbox. I don’t fancy spending the next week in a cell. 

I push the letter box flap a little. I can see there is some light inside and a rug on the floor. There’s a small table by the door, it has some keys on it and her trainers are sitting there neatly as if just taken off. So she’s in, right I’ll knock again then. 

Before I can stand up, something wet brushes the top of my finger. I look back to the opening and stumble backwards, pulling my hand out of there so fast that I’m surprised I’ve not broken it. 

The flap of the letterbox slaps shut, but doesn’t close. It’s stuck in there. 

A fucking tongue. 

‘Oh are you delivering a letter too?’ A voice comes from my side. I’m on my bum backed up against the wall now. Nowhere to go.

A figure steps forward, I start to make him out. It’s the postman from earlier, how is he here? He’s smiling at me but his eyes say something different. 

‘Or do you just like to fiddle with letterboxes too?’ As he finishes, he pulls out a letter opener dripping in blood. 

I’m trapped. ",2,1739961970.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

The first couple of days felt strange and like a lot of noise in my mind was gone, my mind was quiet and I seemed to have no thoughts… also all the side effects which were mentioned to me like dry mouth and loss of appetite, headaches etc. 

On the 8th day I began 50mg and started feeling really “out of it” drowsy and sleepy, couldn’t really think and felt blank. I thought maybe it’s a higher dose so it would settle but no, after a few more days felt the same. 

Alongside all of this I was getting to sleep between 1-4am and having to be up at 8am. I then looked at what I needed to cut out to help improve my sleep because at that point I wasn’t clear on whether it was my bad sleep or the medication which was making me experience everything mentioned above. I stopped my beloved specialty coffees and caffeinated fizzy drinks and noticed a big change almost immediately. 

A few more days passed and my sleep was great averaging 8-9hrs a night however the medication was still having the same effects. At this point I had another consultation with my psychiatrist and they advised me to go back down to 30mg for the next 4 weeks and see how things are.

I’m 3 weeks into taking 30mg and not sure what this medication is supposed to be doing, I take it 8-9am each morning and after a few hours I begin to start feeling blank and not my usual sharp self, conversations seem to be more difficult and mind is blank, no drowsiness or tiredness but almost like a dulled version of myself.

At around 5-6pm I begin to feel a lot better and suddenly have a boost of energy, my mind is clearer, I’ve assumed this is the medicine wearing off. This has been a very confusing journey so far and i’m conflicted if the medication is working at all or making me worse. 

If you’ve made it down to the bottom of this colossal ramble I thank you and would appreciate any input, advice, suggestion you may have.

For context, I went to a networking event and I ended up chatting with a solo practitioner. He told me to email him to give me the contact of a lawyer he knew to connect me with him. I emailed him, and said I hoped to stay in touch. he emailed me back saying it was nice meeting me too and even though his firm doesn’t do the trademarks (which is the main law I told him I’m interested in rn, but I’m very open to learning/doing other areas rn) that there’s a lot of good experience at his firm (which does real estate, wills, commercial stuff) I could pick up on and to consider a summer job with him and asked for my CV if I was interested. I sent him my CV and he liked it n asked me to come to his office this week to meet his team and then we’d go to the cafe near his office. 

Although he never explicitly stated that he was interviewing me, I’m assuming this is an informal interview/vibe check, and he probs won’t directly ask me like “tell me a time u worked on a team” etc, However, I’m expecting he’ll ask about my previous work experiences in a more general sense. But I’m not sure if this is also like a more elevated coffee chat in a way? Should be asking him questions too, and what type of questions should I ask him to leave a good impression? 

Any advice and suggestions would be really appreciated!🫶🏼

Hayaan mong sulatan ka sa huling pagkakataon. Just like what I did the day after we got engaged. 

=======

It's been almost three months since D-Day. Bilis no? I thought hindi na ako makakaabot sa point na 'to. Daming beses kong inisip kung paano tatapusin lahat sa sobrang sakit. Kala ko, hindi na ako aabot ng Valentine's. Kaya naman pala. 

You see, hindi naman tumigil ang mundo nung nalaman ko ang lahat. I went to work, talked to you for a while habang sinusubukang ayusin yung meron tayo. 

Pero hindi ko kinaya. 

Nagising ako isang araw na hindi ko na kilala sarili ko. Tumingin na lang ako noon sa salamin and I realized na hindi na ako yung dating ako. 

And it hit me, hindi na talaga puwede. 

Walang second chance lalo na't nag-cheat ka. Deal breaker ko yun and alam mo yun, day 1 pa lang na nag-usap tayo. 

Kaya hindi ko maintindihan kung bakit at paano mo nagawa yun. Pero ayoko na malaman mga sagot mo. Too late, tbh. Ang mahalaga, wala akong regrets. Dahil ginawa ko ang lahat ng makakaya ko para isalba yung meron tayo. Kahit nasira ako sa proseso. 

Kasi minahal kita. Higit pa sa sarili ko noon. 

Kaya isipin mo kung gaano ako kasira noong nabasa ko yung post mo na sana hindi na lang ako ang minahal mo. Na sana pinili mo siya. Na sana sa kaniya ka nag-propose. Gusto kong mawala sa sarili ko nun. Yes, I read it all. 

Sakit. Putangina. Walang kasing sakit. 

Dahil minahal kita. 

Binigay ko halos lahat sayo. Muntikan na yung buong buhay ko. 

Yes, wala ako noong mga panahong kailangan mo ako. Talaga bang wala ako? O ako kasi ang sumalo sa lahat ng angst mo sa mundo at lumubog din ako. Kasi may mga sino-solve rin ako sa sarili ko nun at hindi ko na masabi sayo kasi ikaw ang mas nangailangan noon ng suporta. Ikaw ang mas inintindi ko kesa sa sarili ko. 

Kaya halos mabaliw ako when you asked for space. Few days before my birthday. Gaano ka kasama? 

Imbes na sabihin mo sa akin na may problema, humanap ka na pala ng iba. 

And alam na natin kung paano nagtapos ang kuwento. 

3 years, we should be preparing our wedding by now. Pero wala eh. 

Anyways, I am starting to smile again. Umiinom pa rin ako ng coffee. I am going back to my hobbies. Nakakaya ko na pumunta sa mga dating pinupuntahan natin. Pero hindi pa sa Mary Grace. Maybe some other time. Kanina, nakaya ko nang tumingin sa opposite side ng LRT nang nakangiti. 

Uusad na ako mula sa kuwento natin ha. Hindi ko alam kung kaya kitang patawarin. Pero hiling ko lang, sa kabila ng lahat, maging mabait pa rin ang tadhana sayo at sa pamilya mo. Iyakap mo ako sa pamangkin mo. For sure, nagtatanong na yun. 

Pero sana, hindi na kita makasalubong ulit. Not in this lifetime. Naghihilom na ako.

And now I’m stuck- they seem very similar in terms of functions and I’m fairly sure after a lot of googling that the De’Longhi website does not actually give accurate information about the functions (it says no ‘my coffee’ on the Dinamica Plus, and different websites both De’Longhi and otherwise give varying information on thermoblocks and which models have an app or can pour two coffees at once ).  

Can anyone offer any thoughts that would help me make a decision, please? I’m looking primarily for a machine for two people, 1-2 cups a day, that can make reasonably hot cappuccino and Americano with an easy to use and easy to clean milk function. 

Would also like to have quick-to-select ‘my coffee’ for two users - there’s lots online about how to set these up, but I can’t find how easy they are to select one once it’s been set up. 

Specifically looking at the ECAM380.95 amongst the Dinamica Plus models simply because it’s cheaper than the other variants but could go for any of them.

Espresso lovers know the rich, bold flavor is unmatched. But not everyone has an espresso machine at home. The good news? You don’t need one to enjoy a strong, delicious espresso. With a few simple tools and some patience, you can brew a cup that rivals any café.

This guide will show you how to do it right. Get ready to impress yourself and your friends with your homemade espresso skills. Let’s dive into the process and make some great coffee!

# Espresso Basics

Espresso is a strong and concentrated coffee enjoyed by many around the world. Making espresso at home without a machine can be challenging but is possible. Understanding the basics of espresso is crucial before diving into the process. This guide will help you learn what espresso is and the key ingredients needed to make a perfect cup.

# What Is Espresso?

Espresso is a type of coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water through finely-ground coffee beans. It is known for its rich flavor and thick consistency. It is the base for many popular coffee drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos.

**Key characteristics of espresso include:**

* **Strong flavor:** Espresso has a more intense flavor compared to regular coffee.
* **Small serving size:** Typically served in small quantities, usually 1-2 ounces.
* **Crema:** A golden layer of foam on top, indicating a well-made espresso.
* **Quick brewing time:** Takes about 25-30 seconds to brew.

Espresso is enjoyed by itself or as a base for other drinks. Knowing these characteristics helps you understand what makes espresso unique and why it is loved by coffee enthusiasts.

# Key Ingredients

Making espresso requires just a few ingredients, but each plays a vital role in achieving the perfect cup. The primary ingredients include:

* **Coffee beans:** Use high-quality, dark roast coffee beans. Freshly ground beans are essential for the best flavor.
* **Water:** Use filtered water to avoid impurities that can affect the taste.

**Details on the ingredients:**

|Ingredient|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Coffee Beans|Choose a dark roast for a rich, bold flavor. Grind them just before brewing.|
|Water|Filtered water enhances the taste and quality of the espresso.|

Aside from the primary ingredients, you might need some additional tools like a grinder, kettle, and a method to apply pressure to the coffee grounds. These tools help replicate the pressure and temperature needed for a good espresso.

Long time lurker here, been doing 24-72h fasts every week for the last year, because of the time saving, the way it makes me feel, and the potential health benefits. 

I‘d like to try a longer fasting period, but the reality is that it gets me anxious, because i am often stuck around 72h feeling dizzy and nauseous… which i‘m guess is the electrolytes lacking…? Which is where my issue is.

My family and myself we have many types of electrolytes at home because of the sports we do. They have bought so many sorts to try to help me; but i can never consume them. I just cannot drink or eat them, I directly get nauseous. The taste of them is just plain wrong to me. And it gets worse when they are accompanied by sweeteners and fruit/sweets flavors. 

Anyone has experience with pre-made pills for electrolytes ? Would that work ok ? (I saw a recommendation not to do them ourselves in the wiki…)

Or maybe savory mix (savory savory, not the „watermelon&salt“ type, lol) ? Like beef taste or vegetable broth flavor?

Would love to hear your ideas and about your experience :)

 (i‘m a rather dirty faster; coke zero, black coffee and green tea are my besties, so as long as there is very low calories, i‘ll consider your suggestions!!)

Thanks a lot in advance guys :)
