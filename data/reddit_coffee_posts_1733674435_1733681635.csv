1h9oo56,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1h9oo56/am_i_just_being_impatient/,Am I just being impatient? ,"I am 29f 5‚Äô7, and 208lbs. I know this makes me overweight, but I have a lot of muscle and carry my weight well. I look more like I weigh 180~. I wfh and sit a lot but I do weightlift for at least an hour 5 days a week. I‚Äôve been trying to build muscle so I go pretty heavy. I have been trying to cut some of this extra weight and haven‚Äôt been too strict the last few months so my weight hasn‚Äôt changed. I know I‚Äôve gotten stronger based on what I‚Äôm capable of in the gym but i still want to lose about 35lbs. 

About a week ago, I decided to really buckle down and do things ‚Äúright‚Äù and focus less on building muscle (just maintaining as much as I can) and more on cutting. I use ‚Äúright‚Äù loosely bc have reduced my calories to about 1200 a day, sometimes less. On the days it‚Äôs less, I‚Äôm still fully satisfied by my meals and not hungry. Like genuinely, I feel great. Sleeping better, better digestion, still working out and seeing progress with my lifts. 
I have been counting using an app to track food, weighing everything, trying to hit my protein goals (at least 100g a day), etc while being in a deficit, like literally doing everything right on that front. I eat oatmeal with protein powder and berries for breakfast, and a lot of salmon and broccoli, chicken and Brussels sprouts, egg whites with chicken sausage, protein shakes. I don‚Äôt snack or have sweets that aren‚Äôt tracked. I don‚Äôt use any sauces or oils that aren‚Äôt tracked. I drink plenty of water. I don‚Äôt drink coffee or tea, just the occasional ghost energy drink and sugarfree Dr Pepper with dinner. 

I know that‚Äôs a very low amount of calories, and not sustainable or something I plan to do long term, but after being 208lbs for months, I just wanted to do it for a few weeks to get the scale to move and to feel accomplished for like actually full-assing this instead of just estimating things and cheating and not really taking it seriously.. but yes, I know that this isn‚Äôt something I should do for long and I don‚Äôt plan to. I recently had bloodwork done and everything is a-okay so I feel comfortable with my health. No thyroid issues, no hormonal issues, no health issues at all to speak of. Completely average in all areas. My dr also said that I don‚Äôt look like I weigh as much as I do, and we talked about 165-175 being a a good goal weight for me as long as I‚Äôm maintaining my muscle. Honestly, I got down to 155lbs during covid and I looked closer to 125lbs and didn‚Äôt feel healthy. I don‚Äôt feel like my -35lbs goal should feel so unattainable. 

I do wfh and am mostly sedentary aside from the gym. I average like 5-6k steps a day. I know I could step things up in that area and do more cardio but is that really going to be what makes or breaks this for me?? Shouldn‚Äôt an hour of pushing myself to lift heavy weights for AMRAP, til failure for every exercise, be enough with how little im eating? 

Like WHY has my weight been going up?  I woke up and weighed in at 211lbs. Like WHY?!??. But I didn‚Äôt consume something super high in sodium last night. Just my usual fish and veg. I had one mini airhead while we watched a movie. I haven‚Äôt taken creatine in weeks now. 

Like sure, yes, I‚Äôm sure my body is changing and I just can‚Äôt see it yet, I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôm not *actually* gaining weight consuming so few calories. But is this just part of making progress? Is the scale going to just magically drop 10 pounds one day next week?? Surely I can‚Äôt be building enough muscle fast enough to cancel out fat loss. 

I am concerned and confused because I know that eating so few calories is probably not going to serve me well long term, but after seeing literally no results, I‚Äôm concerned that when I do go back to like 1700-1800, my progress will be even more stagnant. I really am trying to be as realistic as possible and I know progress is slow, I don‚Äôt have a goal date to cut this weight by. I just want to be able to see the muscle I‚Äôve built and fit into some of my old clothes.

I guess I just need some opinions. Someone to weigh in on my scenario. Some criticism and advice on what to change and expect. ",1,1733681014.0,loseit,0,0.67,False

My wife and I are early 30s, and we have two youn (8u) children. Our travel in the past has always been budget - never stayed at a chain. We‚Äôre very frugal. 

However, this past year, I decided we‚Äôre well off enough, and have the flexibility, to have nicer stays. 

I really didn‚Äôt know what to expect - but I‚Äôm blown away. This resort is very well kept. It‚Äôs large, and every staff member is super kind (save for one employee at their on-property coffee shop). When we arrived, we were offered sparkling wine, and given a free upgrade to a corner room! I didn‚Äôt even ask for these things. Then, I realized in the app I could request things - they brought a razor for my wife because she forgot hers, saving us a trip to a store, and they brought us robes shortly after requesting them! This may be normal/BAU stuff for most of you, but for a newcomer that normally travels cheap and budget-friendly, this has been astounding to me.

https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rem/low.html

Hello everyone, I hope all is well. Today we are going to be discussing ‚ÄúLow‚Äù which is the third song on the ‚ÄúTime Side‚Äù of the band‚Äôs seventh studio album Out of Time. 

‚ÄúLow‚Äù, at least to me, is one of those songs that‚Äôs a grower and not a shower. It‚Äôs not flashy like ‚ÄúShiny Happy People‚Äù or ‚ÄúLosing My Religion‚Äù nor does it seem as interesting as ‚ÄúBelong‚Äù or ‚ÄúCountry Feedback.‚Äù But it‚Äôs a song that really starts to bloom over its runtime and makes you think on repeated listens. 

The song begins with a few different elements. One is this palm muted electric guitar riff playing an A-G-B progression. You also have a faint organ being played by Mike in the background and Bill playing some congas. Scott Aukerman said on the podcast that this song has a coffee shop vibe and even though to some that may seem like an insult, I can see what he means. It‚Äôs a chilled atmosphere but there‚Äôs something about that guitar progression that makes it seem like the song is going to be deep. 

And it kinda is actually. Michael‚Äôs vocals are lower in tone (fitting the song‚Äôs title) as he sings about dusk and dawn and where the time went. He also mentions how he‚Äôs been laughing, moving in slow motion and howling at the moon like a wild animal. The lyrics about both morning and night suiting him well also makes me think of some sort of animal. Around this section you can start to hear the faint glimpses of some beautiful strings. But then he starts to sing about how he‚Äôs been high, low, happy and inbetween which just makes me think of life in general. Most people in life experience highs and lows, although I‚Äôve seen some people interpret these lyrics about the highs and lows of doing drugs. 

We then get a big contrast in sound as the chorus sees the guitar progression change to something more uplifting as the strings start to develop more. Peter also starts to strum the chords in a bigger and more open way which helps the song to bloom. Michael sings ‚ÄúI skipped the part about love, it seems so silly and low‚Äù which makes me wonder if this song is actually about love and how it can make you feel high and low. 
The chorus ends with this wicked cello slide which gave me goosebumps the first time I heard it. 

The strings start becoming more apparent in the second verse as Michael starts talking to someone. He mentions how morning isn‚Äôt their time and how they can see their ‚Äúlines.‚Äù He also sings ‚Äúyour grass is grassy wet, your light white is bright‚Äù which some people also think is a reference to drugs.  And it very well good be, but I really see this song more of a poem when it comes to the lyrics. Which is why I think it‚Äôs important that in the second chorus Michael changes the words up a bit and sings ‚Äúit seems so shallow and low‚Äù when referring to love. I‚Äôm almost getting a sense that Michael, or the character he‚Äôs singing through, is coming to a point in their life where they are realizing everything ends eventually and that they are willing to pass on love and not let it become important to them. 

After that chorus, Peter‚Äôs strumming becomes more forceful again and Michael‚Äôs vocals start to increases in volume and intensity. He sings ‚Äúyou and me, we know about time. We know how things go, they come and go, they live and grow.‚Äù These lyrics further strength my idea that this song is about looking at life with the viewpoint that life passes no matter what you do or don‚Äôt do. There‚Äôs ebbs and flows, and that includes the way we feel and the way we perceive things like love. The building up of the strings during this part sounds stunning as they give way to Michael‚Äôs voice as he‚Äôs really starting to sing. 

It‚Äôs a great dynamic with how the song slides back down a bit in volume with the last double chorus and back down even further afterwards as Michael repeats ‚Äúlow, low, low.‚Äù Eventually the band is back to where they were at the beginning of the song except for Michael who sings new lyric about how he likes this person‚Äôs hands because they are full of glory. It‚Äôs an odd but somehow fitting way to end this song as we get a couple of guitar strings being plucked as the song comes to an end. 

I‚Äôm glad I finally came around to this song because I think it has a lot to offer. Musically it gives this album variety when it comes to the string arrangement, the dynamics in volume and the congas that just work perfectly on this song. Michael‚Äôs vocals also have a great range as he sings about the lows and highs when it comes to love but also just time itself. It‚Äôs no wonder this album was called Out of Time. It‚Äôs definitely a fan favorite from what I can tell despite it only being played live 45 times. Although there‚Äôs a phenomenal unplugged version of this song and it strangely enough has a music video that‚Äôs quite artsy. 

But what do you think of this track? Is this a stand out moment on Out of Time. What do you think the song is about? Favorite lyrical or musical moments? And were you lucky enough to have seen this tune live?",1,1733680866.0,rem,0,1.0,False

Em was one of those musicians like Paul McCartney were nobody could touch him in terms of respect and being at the top of his game.

But it can‚Äôt be ignored that this reputation isn‚Äôt really intact with the wider world outside of his fanbase, as over the last decade or so, there‚Äôs been a growing number of people clowning him or going back and reevaluating his legacy (what comes to mind is Snoop not having him in his top 5, and other rappers from Detroit claiming he‚Äôs not all that)

I‚Äôm wondering what you think is the moment where the crown began to slip, if you could point to a single moment in his career, where the tide began to turn.

My opinion is the BET freestyle when ‚Äòthat‚Äôs an awfully hot coffee pot‚Äô became a mainstream meme beyond just hip hop circles. 

I think that‚Äôs the first real moment I saw him being laughed at instead of laughing along side him.

I thought I had finally found the key to achieve more battery life and thought it was only a matter of installing auto-cpufreq, (which it wasnt) so I decided to change to POP!\_OS because everything seems less blurry on that distro, so I installed auto-cpufreq after changing to pop and I can't get those 6h again, I'm only getting 3-4h :(

I appreciate any help

The issue‚Ä¶

My bio parents divorced when I (44m) was 14 (nMom cheated) and when I was 16 she had my half-brother with her second husband.  We weren‚Äôt really in a financial position to make it easy, so my younger full-brother (m41 now) had to share a room and we both got deputized voluntold caregivers.  Needless to say this put a strain on the relationships with both brothers.  New brother got all the attention and consideration‚Ä¶ example: my mother got rid of my cat one day while I was at school (which I loved, it was my only safe space) ‚Ä¶ saying it wasn‚Äôt healthy to have a cat in the house while she was as pregnant.  And so on and so on‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fair to say 16 year old me resented hi a LOT.  And my relationship with my full-brother suffered because of being forced into proximity.  Plus she‚Äôd play us off each other‚Ä¶ getting my brother to snoop through my stuff so she could say ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs HIS room too.. I didn‚Äôt snoop‚Äù.  Anyways‚Ä¶ I left for Uni far away as soon as I could.  I‚Äôd come back to visit on holidays and in the summer for the first year or so‚Ä¶ but soon I was using study or work to skip family stuff.  I‚Äôd never have enough time to visit everyone when I came back, and if I spent more than one day visiting my Dads side my mom would throw tantrums‚Ä¶ it just became an obligation, there was no joy and it and it strained my already tight budget to travel.  Once I was out of Uni I went back even less.  So needless to say I never really had a relationship with my half-brother when he was young‚Ä¶ he got engaged right before the pandemic and put their wedding on indefinite hold.    He was in my wedding party 10 years ago‚Ä¶ mostly out of obligation, both me and my wife had our siblings as our party.  I don‚Äôt hate him, in fact I wish him all the best, but we just don‚Äôt have any kind of relationship.  

This summer shit apparently hit the fan in a MASSIVE way‚Ä¶ he got married‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt invited and no one told me about it.  I also found out through the grape vine that a week before his wedding my nMom announced that she was leaving her third husband (brother was with husband 2) and was moving back to the butt-fuck nowhere town she grew up in (and hates more than anything this world) to be with a highschool crush she‚Äôd been in contact with for a year.  This has been her MO her whole life‚Ä¶ I think she‚Äôs been single for MAYBE a month total since she was 18‚Ä¶ she goes from husband to boyfriend to husband to another husband‚Ä¶ always lining the next one up weeks or months ahead of time and literally moving out from one and into another.  She‚Äôs now mid sixties btw.  But for some reason insisted on bring her now latest ex-husband to the wedding anyways‚Ä¶ his own kids didn‚Äôt even know and found out at the wedding.

My initial reaction was to be hurt about not being invited‚Ä¶  I know we‚Äôre not close, but he was at my wedding and nothing good or bad has happened between us since.  But I took a second and realized it was his wedding, his choice‚Ä¶ and I remember hating how much of my own wedding was obligation and not choice.  Weddings are expensive so at the end of the day if me not going meant he could invite someone he actually wanted there‚Ä¶ great.  I also realized that with my mother kinda out of the picture (she moved across the province, 18 hours away I might actually be able to have a relationship with my brother.  My mom basically used everyone as spies whether they realized or not and bad mouthed me constantly to everyone.  So I find it extremely hard to trust ANYONE In my mom‚Äôs orbit.  

I sent him a congratulations message about a week after the wedding as soon as I found out and he responded saying thanks and that he hoped I understood as I haven‚Äôt really been a part of his life and that it hurt that his oldest brother basically abandoned him.  I told him I completely understand, no hard feelings and I don‚Äôt blame him one bit for not inviting me and for how he feels toward me.  We chatted a bit and ended up making very tentative plans to grab a coffee next time I‚Äôm in town‚Ä¶ maybe at Xmas.

So here‚Äôs the rub‚Ä¶ I have no idea how deep my mother‚Äôs claws are sunk into him and how much of her alternate facts he believes.  It SEEMS that they have a pretty decent relationship‚Ä¶ his partner seems to get along with her‚Ä¶. And if we do talk I want to make it about US not her‚Ä¶ but how do I explain my side of things without that context?  If they do have a relationship he‚Äôs happy with I don‚Äôt want to get in the way of that‚Ä¶ but if that‚Äôs the case it makes it that much harder to trust him‚Ä¶ I also don‚Äôt want this to become further ammo against me ‚Äúwhy are you filling your brothers head with lies‚Ä¶ why are you trying to turn him against me‚Äù.  I‚Äôve basically become isolated from her entire side of the family‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre all very don‚Äôt rock the boat‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt make a fuss, can‚Äôt we all just turn a blind eye and be nice.  Not kind‚Ä¶ nice.  So in the decades of issues with my mom they‚Äôve never once reached out to me‚Ä¶ to get my side of the story or even just see if I was OK.  I have to assume they either believe my mother‚Äôs reality or they just don‚Äôt care enough to intervene.. family matters are family matters, it‚Äôs none of our business and/or I‚Äôm not putting myself in the line of fire.

I know I‚Äôm partially to blame for basically tapping out not building a relationship with him‚Ä¶ he was an innocent casualty of my relationship with my mom‚Ä¶ I feel terribly guilty about it all the time, but I just don‚Äôt know how to go about fixing things without jeopardizing the peace I‚Äôve built being almost no-contact with my mother.  Bring him into my life opens doors for my mom to weasel her way back in.  Help?

Took it about 8am and 45 minutes later when I was playing a video game I felt this very clear focusing in effect to what I was doing. I usually flick between multiple activities and check my phone constantly but for the first time I was able to just enjoy doing the one thing. 

I also for the first time in my life didn't feel the compulsion to fidget. I constantly bite my nails, pull my skin, make repetitive movements with my hands, and have thoughts looping over and over in my head. I still felt the desire there but I was easily able to say ""No"" with confidence and feel comfortable staying still. 

I didn't feel the rush or feeling or euphoria I've seen people anecdotally report. I more just felt a sense of calm and clarity. My mind wasn't racing, I wasn't stressed at the thought of doing basic chores, and I've been able to focus on conversations with my partner without getting distracted. 

Perhaps it's because I've done plenty of stimulants recreationally in the past (coke, ecstasy etc) that I'm just blunted to the effects. I've also been dependent on caffeine for as long as I can remember, so I also took today to have no caffeine going forward to give the medication the best chance. I've had a pretty bad headaches from having no caffeine, I usually have 2-3 strong coffees a day and a tea. I hope that the withdrawals go away soon. 

On the whole very positive. I can feel the effects wearing off now (5.30pm), and I'll see how it may affect my sleep. My appetite has also been pretty suppressed. I can put away a lot of food and tend to eat quite fast causing a lot of heartburn. But today I at a much more moderate amount of food and ate a lot slower, so I'm taking that as a benefit too. 

I have work tomorrow so I'm glad I took it today so there's nothing unexpected for when I have to focus up. Got a medication review in early January, depending on how the month goes I may ask for the dose to be upped, as I didn't feel that strong effects today, just a nice reduction in many ADHD symptoms I exhibit.

1h9nyc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1h9nyc8/wibta_if_i_canceled_my_birthday_next_year/,"WIBTA if I ""canceled"" my birthday next year","My husband and his family make a big deal out of birthdays and, being a December baby, my birthday is a nuance and inconvenience. They do these ""birthday wishes,"" which is basically where anything you want is a ""yes."" I hate it because it feels like a guilt trip to the receiver. 

Growing up I was always gifted money from my immediate family with the idea behind it being, ""Look, you have birthday money, you can get Christmas gifts for other people!"" I have very few early childhood memories, but one I remember was getting $10 for my 10th birthday and going to the store to buy my father hankerchiefs and socks for Christmas. The total was $10.10 (I was told I had to work off the $0.10 later) and I paid for my purchase with the ten dollar bill with ""Feliz cumplea√±os mija"" written on it. The cashier started a conversation with me asking if this was my birthday money and why I was spending it on something obviously not for me and I told her that my birthday wasn't as important as Christmas and that's when my nana started yelling at her in Spanish. The woman kept pointing at me, pointing at the toy section and the candy area at the checkout, then back at the socks. I never could understand my nana when she spoke Spanish fast, but I gathered the cashier was telling my nana that a child should spend her birthday money on herself. 

Fast forward to 2024 and turning 44 years old and I don't even want to try anymore. My husband's heart is in the right place, but his actions just don't match. All week he kept talking about my ""birthday weekend"" and how we are going to celebrate me/do things I want to do all weekend... but apparently I had to plan it all. ALL. He had no ""plans"" for the weekend at all. Saturday morning went to a bar where our friend is the head chef that ended up costing $50 for 2 coffees and each of our meals. I saved $100 for myself for my birthday and the husband saved nothing. 

Okay, no big deal, we've still got the day to ourselves - the next place we end up going is the disk golf shop he's been wanting to go to for a while. I don't play disk golf BTW. We don't buy him anything because we spent $50 on breakfast otherwise he wanted to drop $40 on a disk. Where to next? He wants to hit a Gamestop or another used shop. At the game store he basically tells me I'm buying myself a new controller for my Switch because the pro controller I use is 4+ years old and experiencing drift. I don't want to spend money on a new controller because I can just use the joycon ones, but he is angry and insisted I get a new one; he'd be more willing to play games with me on my Switch if he could use a pro controller too. Again, I didn't want to spend money on it but he insisted I had to get myself something for my birthday. 

We're now sitting with $20 left for my birthday weekend and the ONE thing I want to do is have Dim Sum for Sunday brunch - which we can now no longer afford. He offers to stop and get an iced coffee which I say no to because it's $7. He suggests getting a preroll at the dispensary and I say, ""if that's what you want then we can get one,"" because it's not what I want (we have lots of stuff at home from work freebies).

I tried to explain to him that we only had $100 for my birthday, and we don't get food stamps for 9 days, so maybe we should just get a couple of loaves of bread for lunches during the week and go home. 

I asked him about it he had any thoughts for dinner and, ""it's your birthday, what do you want to make."" Nothing. We had nothing for dinner. 

Today is my actual birthday and I was denied 3 birthday wishes before 6am. I'm always the person on dog-duty because I'm the lightest sleeper and I'm more aware when the dogs are signaling they need to go outside. Shortly after midnight they wanted to go out. I had already been in bed for 90+ minutes and my husband just decided to go to bed (which woke up the dogs) and they were whining and signaling they needed to go out. When they made noise and he ignored them I asked ""So I can start using my wishes now?"" He got upset and grumbled about needing to find a shirt so I got out of bed and did it. He was asleep by the time I got them back inside. Around 3am there was a noise outside and I asked again if he'd handle looking at it/taking the dogs out and asked to use one of my 44 wishes and he grumbled (at the same time the dogs went crazy) so I took them out. Just after 6 o'clock the dog started to signal to go out (normal wakeup time) and I said from under the covers, ""Can I please at least try to sleep in birthday,"" and he totally lost his shit. He huffs and puffs and gets out of bed to take the dogs out, slamming all the door as he goes, and when he comes back inside he says ""Well I'm fucking awake now so sleep in"" and leaves the bedroom. I tried to get up to offer to make him coffee but he tells me to go back to bed, then I reminded him that we didn't have sugar for the coffee and he told me not to worry about it and he was going to go to the store. For like 0.01 of a second I thought maybe he'd come home with something for me from the store but all he did was get a coffee at the gas station and a honey bun for himself. 

I don't keep seeing the point in trying to celebrate ""me"" on my birthday. I haven't even mentioned a cake or candles (or even a gift I didn't have to pick and pay for myself) because what's the point. 

WIBTA if I just told to not worry about my birthday anymore. My mom died when I was 31 and she was the only one who ever seemed to care - IDK I just feel like an asshole because I've never seen a reason to feel like my birthday is important. ",23,1733679120.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,13,1.0,False

Might update one later from work tonight. It's light pink, will be in a collins glass with ice and garnished with a sprig of rosemary. It's herbal, wintery, tart, slightly fruity, and bubbly. 

Ingredients are:

 Trakal (pronounced trah-call), that's the base spirit \*\*

Limecello

Creme de mure (blackberry liqeuer, that makes it pink and brings most of the tartness but blackberry is not a primary flavor of the final product)

Rosemary syrup

Lime juice

Creole bitters and mol√© bitters

Spritz of herbsaint 

Topped with tonic water

\*\* We've made Trakal drinks before and already used Trakal Me Maybe and Last Trakal. Don't want to use Trakal Me By Your Name because someone in the movie got cancelled and some of our customer base would 100% bring that up. Those were the main immediate ideas. 

Name does not at all have to be a Trakal pun, but it does seem like a rich area. Trakal is from the Patagonian region of Chile and heavily markets as a Patagonian spirit and 'the spirit of the rainforest', so it could also be the Patagonian Something or something from that. (I am in the US, not South America.)

Most of the other decided drink names on the same menu are a mix of referencing ingredients or music references (ex. Coffee and Cigarettes for a coffee old fashioned).

1h9nnrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1h9nnrj/after_one_year_of_living_outside_seattle_i_cant/,"After one year of living outside Seattle, I can‚Äôt believe I used to like Seattle","Having lived in Seattle for 7 years and making a 1 year move to Chicago (to support my wife who got job opportunity there) before coming back, I am disappointed by this place. I don‚Äôt have experience living in any other place in US besides these two, though.


1. Homelessness in downtown: Just yesterday, took my wife to downtown, started with a cute monorail ride from Seattle center to Westlake in the evening. By the time we were returning back, 3rd and pine was filled with as many homeless folks as regular passengers waiting for bus. Some were visibly stoned/drunk.  My wife dropped the idea of getting a dessert on the way and rushed us back home.

Since COVID happened, homelessness issue has dramatically worsened. I thought things would recover in couple years but now I have given up hope.

People had scared me about Chicago so much before I moved there, but I didn‚Äôt find a single homeless person in several stretches of downtown and places where I found were beggars who had reserved specific spots everyday to ask for coins. Didn‚Äôt see a single drunk/stoned person who stinks of urine.

Ofcourse, I completely avoided southern suburbs of Chicago which is bad. 

2. Inflation: This was most surprising as I felt not much would have changed during 1 year of being away. Compared to Chicago, Seattle is massively more expensive for everyday items. Although, to be fair, Chicago and suburbs themselves are seeing huge inflation in terms of real estate/rent, but in Seattle, even getting a coffee is such an expense. A local shop near my house sells 12oz mocha for $7+ with tax.
We have been thinking of buying home but now really consider only 2-3 bedrooms even to keep a budget under $1MM.
Some of my colleagues pay about $4000 in monthly rent, which seems obnoxious considering the salary bracket their role provides. My wife and I literally downsized our rental from chicago to seattle by 50% to have reasonable rent expense.

When you're traveling, the journey can sometimes be as important as the destination itself. From hiking in remote areas to exploring bustling cities, every trip offers the chance to create lasting memories. For many travelers, one of the highlights of the day is enjoying a comforting cup of coffee. But what do you do when you're on the go and can't find that perfect brew? This is where a portable coffee maker comes in, revolutionizing the way we experience coffee while traveling.

Portable coffee makers are small, efficient, and incredibly versatile. They provide an easy solution for travelers, campers, and anyone who loves a good cup of coffee but doesn't want to rely on hotel rooms, local cafes, or overpriced airport brews. Whether you're exploring the outdoors or navigating the city streets, a portable coffee maker ensures you can enjoy fresh coffee whenever you need it. Let‚Äôs explore why every traveler should consider taking a portable coffee maker on their next adventure.

# 1. Enjoy Fresh Coffee Anytime, Anywhere

The main benefit of a portable coffee maker is the ability to enjoy fresh coffee wherever you are. Whether you're in a remote mountain cabin, camping by a lake, or staying in a city apartment with subpar coffee options, you can brew your own cup of coffee to your exact liking.

No more settling for stale hotel coffee or overpriced drinks at local cafes. With a portable coffee maker, you get to enjoy the taste of freshly brewed coffee each morning, no matter where your travels take you. Whether you're in the wild outdoors or in an unfamiliar city, you'll never have to worry about finding a quality coffee source again.

# 2. Convenience for Busy Travelers

When you're on the move, time can be your biggest constraint. Early flights, long road trips, and packed itineraries can leave little room for coffee runs. A portable coffee maker eliminates the need to search for a caf√© or wait in line for a cup. You can make coffee in the comfort of your hotel room, rental, or even in your car on the go.

Most portable coffee makers are quick and easy to use, giving you a fresh cup of coffee within minutes. Whether you're in a rush to catch a flight or just need a pick-me-up before a long day of exploring, a portable coffee maker streamlines the process, allowing you to enjoy your brew without wasting valuable time.

# 3. Cost-Effective Coffee While Traveling

Traveling can get expensive, and when you‚Äôre constantly buying coffee at cafes, airports, or hotels, the costs add up quickly. A portable coffee maker provides a cost-effective solution. Instead of paying for overpriced coffee, you can bring your own coffee grounds or pods and brew your favorite beverage for a fraction of the cost.

Imagine how much you could save over the course of a long trip if you skipped buying coffee at every stop. The money you save can be better spent on experiences, activities, or souvenirs. Plus, portable coffee makers are usually built to last, so they are a great long-term investment for frequent travelers.

# 4. Tailor Your Coffee to Your Preferences

When you're at a caf√© or using a hotel coffee machine, you're limited to what‚Äôs available. With a portable coffee maker, you can choose your own coffee beans, adjust the grind size, and experiment with different brewing methods to suit your taste. Whether you like a bold, strong espresso or a mild cup of drip coffee, a portable coffee maker gives you complete control over your brew.

This flexibility is especially valuable for coffee enthusiasts who have specific preferences or dietary restrictions. With your own coffee maker, you can ensure you're getting exactly what you want, rather than having to compromise when options are limited.

# 5. Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Travel

Sustainability is becoming increasingly important for travelers, and portable coffee makers offer a more eco-friendly way to enjoy your coffee on the go. Rather than relying on disposable cups, lids, and stirrers from cafes, you can use your own reusable mug or thermos. Many portable coffee makers also come with reusable filters, reducing your reliance on paper filters or single-use pods.

By choosing a portable coffee maker, you are making a conscious choice to reduce waste while still enjoying your coffee wherever you are. This small but impactful change can help make your travels more sustainable, while still keeping your coffee routine intact.

# 6. Perfect for Camping and Outdoor Adventures

For those who love the great outdoors, a portable coffee maker is an essential piece of gear. When camping, hiking, or traveling to remote locations, the ability to brew your own coffee can be a real game-changer. Outdoor coffee-making setups are typically simple, requiring no electricity or complicated equipment, making them ideal for roughing it in nature.

Whether you're camping by a fire, trekking through a national park, or simply enjoying a scenic hike, a portable coffee maker allows you to enjoy a hot, fresh cup of coffee while surrounded by nature. No need to worry about finding a coffee shop in the middle of nowhere‚Äîyour portable coffee maker will provide the perfect brew, wherever your adventure takes you.

# 7. Consistent Coffee Quality

One of the frustrations of traveling is dealing with inconsistent coffee quality. Hotel coffee machines may give you a lukewarm, watered-down cup, and coffee from a local caf√© might not meet your expectations. With a portable coffee maker, you can consistently enjoy high-quality coffee that matches your preferences.

Portable coffee makers are designed for ease of use and are often made with durable materials that ensure the coffee is brewed to perfection. Whether you're brewing on the go or at your accommodation, you can count on getting a well-made cup of coffee each time.

# 8. Space-Saving and Lightweight Design

One of the main reasons portable coffee makers are so popular among travelers is their compact design. Unlike bulky coffee machines, these devices are small, lightweight, and easy to pack. They can easily fit into a carry-on bag, suitcase, or backpack without taking up too much space.

This makes them ideal for travelers who need to maximize their luggage space or those who prefer traveling light. Whether you're backpacking across Europe, driving cross-country, or taking a weekend trip, a portable coffee maker can easily be added to your packing list without weighing you down.

# 9. No Need for Special Equipment or Power Sources

A major advantage of portable coffee makers is their ability to function without special equipment or power sources. Many models are manual, meaning they don‚Äôt require electricity or batteries. This is especially useful when you're staying in places with limited power access, such as campgrounds, cabins, or rural locations.

Whether you're brewing coffee using a French press, pour-over, or AeroPress method, you don‚Äôt need an outlet or external power to get your coffee fix. This makes portable coffee makers perfect for travelers who like to go off the grid or stay in places without modern amenities.

# 10. Great for Road Trips and Long Drives

For road trip enthusiasts, portable coffee makers are a must-have accessory. Long drives can get tiring, and sometimes stopping for coffee can be inconvenient or unappealing. With a portable coffee maker, you can brew your coffee right from the comfort of your car, keeping you energized and focused on the road ahead.

Whether you're parked by the side of the highway or in a scenic rest area, your portable coffee maker allows you to enjoy a freshly brewed cup without leaving your vehicle. This is especially handy on long stretches between cities or in areas with limited coffee shops.

# 11. A Reliable Travel Companion

Having a reliable travel companion in the form of a portable coffee maker can make your journey more enjoyable. Coffee lovers know that having access to good coffee can make all the difference in how you feel during your travels. A portable coffee maker ensures you're never too far away from a fresh, hot cup of coffee, keeping you energized and refreshed throughout your journey.

Whether you're flying, driving, or camping, a portable coffee maker offers a sense of comfort and consistency. It‚Äôs a small investment that pays off by enhancing your overall travel experience.

# Conclusion

Traveling doesn‚Äôt mean you have to sacrifice your love of good coffee. A portable coffee maker gives you the flexibility and freedom to enjoy fresh, personalized coffee no matter where you are. From outdoor adventures to urban explorations, these handy devices allow you to brew your favorite cup of coffee with ease, convenience, and consistency. So, why not enhance your travel experience by taking a portable coffee maker on your next trip?

I‚Äôd love suggestions for unique or cozy coffee shops near or within the SM Clark area where I can relax and read in peace. Bonus points if it‚Äôs Instagrammable!

In the evening, we‚Äôre planning to stroll around Clark Freeport and have dinner nearby. Any recommendations for great dinner spots in the area would be much appreciated!

	‚Ä¢	Fun activities for couples that are unique to Clark/Pampanga (preferably not something we can easily do in Manila).

In her drunken state, she was talking to my father about my social anxiety, she mentioned several times that she's concerned that I don't date, have a sex life, or talk to women due to anxiety.

It made me feel like a complete loser because she's 100% correct. Throughout my life, I've never once mentioned a women's name, as there's nothing to mention.

My father genuinely can't understand because he never had this problem while younger. Talking to him about my problem is like talking to a brick wall.

He doesn't understand that I struggle sitting in a coffee shop, due to the women who work there always make me nervous, to the point I have to sit in the toilets and calm myself down.

I have many guy friends and socalize often, but this apparently isn't good enough for my mother, as she could only focus on my dating life.

I love her dearly, but it seriously irritated me that ""drunk her"" chose to think about my social anxiety, out of anything else.

As you can probably imagine, I'm very much an introvert. My father is an extrovert and genuinely can't stand spending the night at home, unless he's incredibly tired from work, or heavily hungover. I've learned from experience that we're two very different people.

This isn't a question of ""Get out of your comfort zone"" or ""just talk to them bro"", it's goes much further than that.

Due to years of negative self-talk, I no longer believe it's possible to improve (or even start) my dating life, let alone casual sex.

Or if you were to advertise on Gumtree how would you do it to maintain safety (eg someone DRB checked would be good)?

I never miss a flight, and if someone like a tradesman has to come to my flat in the morning, I can always wake up to let them in.  
The science behind this is there's clearly enough cortisol being produced in those situations to wake up. (Melatonin > Cortisol. Interplays with > Dopamine.)

‚Äú*Nothing*?!‚Äù The Lupinor and Vunerian pair parroted. 

‚ÄúYup! You heard me right ‚Äî nothing!‚Äù I acknowledged through a cheeky grin, and a tone of voice that dripped with goofy excitement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs *your* time to shine after all!‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou spit in the face of what little remains of the pride and dignity of this peer group, earthrealmer.‚Äù Ilunor rebutted, his sooty breaths quickly escalating to small bouts of flame-broiled anger.

‚ÄúI understand the noble intent behind restraint and stoicism, Emma. However I cannot see how your plan to do *nothing* will address the core issue we face. It‚Äôd be tantamount to simply *abstaining* at this point, which is decidedly a better alternative if your plan is to simply remain on the sidelines whilst we demonstrate our abilities.‚Äù Thalmin quickly added, before quickly shifting gears to a more concerned tone of voice. ‚ÄúIf this is about making a point to sacrifice your image of strength for our sake, then I must make it clear to you that I will not accept an exchange of face.‚Äù 

However, before I could respond to both of the pair‚Äôs concerns, it was the silent and contemplative Thacea who managed to immediately decipher my cryptic intent, as she turned towards me with a raised brow. 

‚ÄúBy ‚Äò*doing nothing*‚Äô, you are alluding to the passive abilities of your armor, aren‚Äôt you, Emma?‚Äù The princess deduced.

‚Äú*Precisely*, princess.‚Äù I grinned widely, and with a soft cackle that almost immediately brought Thalmin over to my side.

‚ÄúYour suit‚Äôs mana resistance‚Ä¶ *is*, in the eyes of the rules, a form of magic in and of itself.‚Äù The lupinor spoke with a wide toothy grin, his tune completely shifting upon that realization.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd hardly consider *mana resistance* as a display of *magical prowess*.‚Äù Ilunor huffed out, before going quiet, his eyes widening at a certain revelation. ‚ÄúUnless‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs paired with equally impressive displays of magic.‚Äù Thalmin offered, the pair locking eyes right at that moment of clarity. 

‚ÄúThe higher the forms of magic that are resisted or nullified, the more points the mage behind said resistance will earn.‚Äù Ilunor concluded, more or less lending credence to what was at first a far-fetched, half-baked idea born out of me *reaching*. 

‚ÄúSooooo, I‚Äôm guessing this checks out then?‚Äù I asked, prompting the Vunerian to go deep into thought, his brows furrowing in a seriousness that I didn‚Äôt often see from him. 

‚ÄúMake no mistake, Cadet Emma Booker, this‚Ä¶ will serve as the *bare minimum* towards participation. Though given the previous option of being disqualified or gaining practically no points whatsoever‚Ä¶ this will have to do.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHey, if I‚Äôm able to push you guys over the barrier to entry ‚Äî to at least contribute *something* towards participation points ‚Äî then that‚Äôs a win in my book.‚Äù I acknowledged with a beaming smile, a fact that the Vunerian seemed to be both annoyed by yet begrudgingly accepting of. 

‚ÄúBe that as it may be, we are still *woefully* behind in preparations for the House Choosing Ceremony.‚Äù Thacea countered. ‚ÄúGiven our prior intent to abstain, we lack the meticulous planning towards what other peer groups would have undoubtedly already‚Äî‚Äù

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 200% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

*THWACK!*

A leather-bound binder brimming full of loose papers slammed against the coffee table in front of us, the Vunerian proudly displaying his signature cocksure grin, as if *waiting* for this precise moment. 

‚Äú*Correction*, my dear princess. We are, for all intents and purposes, more than *adequately* prepared for this very eventuality.‚Äù The smugness on the Vunerian‚Äôs face could only be challenged by sheer pride and self-satisfaction underlying every syllable of his voice. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve been planning for this all along?‚Äù I asked, cocking my head in abject confusion.

‚ÄúYes. Have you not been following, earthrealmer? LIfe is a game of *theater*, and what greater theater is there than these calls to public performance? *Of course* I‚Äôd have been thoroughly prepared for this very eventuality!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou literally just said you *gave up* because of me.‚Äù I countered bluntly, causing the Vunerian‚Äôs features to waver somewhat. 

‚ÄúWell I‚Äî, you see‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIlunor‚Ä¶ have you been choreographing and composing for a show that you never intended to join?‚Äù Thalmin doubled down, cocking his head in the process as he began rummaging through the folder, revealing pieces of what I could only describe as storyboards, all of which prominently featured a certain Vunerian taking the lead, with a familiar-looking avinor and lupinor present by his side.

I didn‚Äôt know where to start.

Especially as Thalmin began flipping through page after page of genuinely well-sketched out storyboards. 

Though the further he flipped through them, the more intricate they seemed to become‚Ä¶ at least when it came to Ilunor.

This was because the roughly drawn avinor and lupinor eventually stopped appearing on the sketches entirely, replaced instead by vague stick-figure looking silhouettes, with seemingly all artistic effort drained and redirected towards the star of the show ‚Äî Ilunor. 

The disparity between Ilunor and the rest of the drawn figures was striking, with the Vunerian‚Äôs features greatly exaggerated, and his feats of magic drawn to such a degree that left whatever stick figures were in the background to become mere specks on the page. 

Moreover, he even went into the effort of *coloring* and *animating* a few of these pieces, though both the color and animation was entirely reserved for himself and his feats of magic. 

These explorations into the Vunerian‚Äôs artistic endeavors were eventually cut short by the noble in question snatching the pages right out of the lupinor‚Äôs hands, his face puffing with incredulity. 

‚ÄúI will have you know that there *was* a period of time, prior to the loss of all hope, where I had *assumed* the earthrealmer was in fact *not* **truly** manaless. It was within that short span of time that I had taken it upon myself to begin *planning* for the House Choosing Ceremony.‚Äù The Vunerian clarified, though this explanation brought up more questions than it did answers.

‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs gotta be *at least* two hundred or so pages there, Ilunor. How the heck did you have the time, in between running errands for Mal‚Äôtory, to actually sketch all of this out?‚Äù I countered, half out of disbelief, and half due to confusion as to the sudden and unexpected appearance of this more artistically inclined side of the noble.

Though given his track record and stated interests‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve honestly seen this coming.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because I only sketched *five* of those pages at the Academy, earthrealmer.‚Äù Ilunor responded with a sigh. 

That answer was more than enough to clue me into what was going on, as a cheeky grin formed across my face.

‚ÄúThat explains why Thacea and Thalmin only appear in a few of these.‚Äù I began.

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù Ilunor nodded.

‚ÄúThe rest of these works were sketched *prior* to the Academy then.‚Äù I stifled a giggle. ‚ÄúIlunor‚Ä¶ were these your screenplay manuscripts? Your pitch pages? Featuring *you* as the main self-inser‚Äî er, I mean, *protagonist*?‚Äù 

The Vunerian cocked his head in genuine confusion at the first two questions, so much so that he seemed to have ignored the soft jab of that last question. His eyes narrowed as if he was trying to decipher the not-too-insignificant cultural barrier that existed behind the intent of the first two questions, as I doubted a clear and direct parallel existed in the Nexus for them. 

‚Ä¶ 

Or so I thought.

‚ÄúI am‚Ä¶ flattered that you would liken my magical choreography to the concept sketches of a learned artist, earthrealmer.‚Äù The Vunerian managed out under a visibly confused expression. ‚ÄúI did not know you were capable of such adulation.‚Äù The Vunerian paused, before shifting directions once more. ‚ÄúThis is not to say I seek your approval, of course. Far from it. I am merely surprised it took you *this long* to shower me with my rightful praise.‚Äù 

My expression took a drastic dip back into annoyance at the easily-inflated ego of the Vunerian. 

As such, I immediately reached for my newfound weapon against this very eventuality, rummaging through one of the shopping bags‚Ä¶ and pulling out a certain orb-like facsimile of the puffed up noble in front of me.

I promptly squeezed it.

*‚ÄòYour worship pleases me!‚Äô* 

Landing on the *perfect* voiceline.

‚ÄúCareful Ilunor, you‚Äôre starting to become *so much* like your cousin over here.‚Äù I chuckled out, eliciting another flame-broiled pout from the Vunerian.

‚Äú*Ahem*.‚Äù Thacea suddenly butted in, stifling Thalmin‚Äôs growing amusement at the situation, and Ilunor‚Äôs outburst. ‚ÄúIf I may, even *with* these admittedly well planned displays of magical choreography, we still have less than half a day before the start of the house choosing ceremony.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI fail to see the problem, princess.‚Äù Ilunor responded bluntly. 

‚ÄúWe lack the practice and coordination, not to mention the time to properly address issues which may arise from an unproven performance. Moreover, we still need to find a means of introducing Emma into any one of these‚Ä¶ drafts.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI for one think that‚Äôs relatively simple!‚Äù I offered with a cheery smile. ‚ÄúJust end the show off with a *bang*. Preferably not a *literal* bang of course, but a magical one. Aim pure mana spells at me, and just watch as the highest level spells you muster fizzle out on contact with my armor. I think that‚Äôd be a hell of an ending.‚Äù

Everyone paused, turning to one another before nodding in agreement. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you a deal, earthrealmer. Your little display will be the *second to last* sequence in the final act so as to not put *you* in the limelight ‚Äî as you *requested*.‚Äù He reiterated, really *pushing* for his time in the limelight.

‚ÄúI have no objections to that.‚Äù I nodded nonchalantly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the least I can do after messing this up for everyone. Besides, I‚Äôm only there to fulfill the bare minimum, the rest really is up to you guys.‚Äù 

An excitable Ilunor eagerly took over the conversation following that point, as the entire group descended into an intense discussion that reminded me *a lot* of a cross between band, cheerleading, and theater practice back in high school‚Ä¶ not that I participated in *any* of those extracurriculars. 

Though the ordering-in of late-dinner ‚Äî courtesy of Ilunor ‚Äî  *definitely* put me in mind of group project all-nighters. 

Regardless, I couldn‚Äôt help but to feel a certain sense of weird‚Ä¶ separation during the whole thing. 

And it wasn‚Äôt for any lack of participation. 

Because throughout it all, the same sense of group participation remained *strong*. So strong in fact that Ilunor and Thalmin, literal polar opposites, began *vibing* in a way I hadn‚Äôt seen them do before. Combining their strengths, they pooled together ideas from their respective specialties, coalescing the former‚Äôs artistic flair with the latter‚Äôs martial inclinations ‚Äî creating a spectacle worthy of Acela‚Äôs Broadway and Venus‚Äô Cloud Nine. I even managed to pitch several key scenes from the aforementioned theatres, Ilunor gladly accepting many of them, whilst rejecting just as many. 

All in all, the whole brainstorming and workshopping process was just plain *fun*.

However, in spite of many of my suggestions making it through, and my own act being set in stone, the lack of being able to actually *participate* due to the lack of magic‚Ä¶ was just a little bit disappointing.

Despite that though, and to Ilunor‚Äôs credit, the workshopping was completed in a little under two hours.

Following which, we each gladly retired to our rooms. 

With the lupinor and vunerian duo looking much more excited than me and the princess.

‚ÄúSo it is settled then? We will pick as late a time slot as we can so as to ensure we have ample time for the memorization of our respective roles.‚Äù Ilunor announced, prompting a final nod of approval before we went our own ways off to bed.

Or at least, the boys probably did.

As what might have been the end to the night was merely the beginning of another chapter for me and the princess.

The latter wordlessly entered the bathroom.

Whilst I began busying myself with the laundry list of minor activities with varying degrees of mission-relevance.

The first being homework. 

A brief review through tired half-lidded eyes was all I needed to approve most of it, as the EVI more or less hit the nail on the head for both Vanavan and Articord‚Äôs classes.

The second time-consuming task was the continuation of the long term nutritional viability testing of local foodstuffs.

Or to put it simply‚Ä¶ shoving magic dinner into the anti-magic microwave.

The task was completed in seconds, but it‚Äôd be *hours* before I‚Äôd reap the rewards of a hard day‚Äôs work ‚Äî cold, flavorless leftovers.

*I should actually try grabbing some of that ‚Äòcommoner food‚Äô from the markets later‚Ä¶* I thought to myself.

The third, and perhaps the task which would become the bane of the EVI‚Äôs existence, was the planning and design of a housing unit for the wand.

‚ÄúEVI?‚Äù

**‚ÄúYes, Cadet Booker?‚Äù**

‚ÄúDesignate new operational objective ‚Äî Project *Wand Step for Mankind*.‚Äù 

**‚ÄúAcknowledged.‚Äù**

The back and forths into the specific parameters of potential housing units were tossed around following that, occupying my mind as my body went on autopilot for the fourth and probably least important task of the night ‚Äî unpacking the spoils of *shopping*.

Glassware, alchemy sets, pens, stationeries, and a whole host of random knick-knacks were quickly arranged by my tent. 

With the most important item out of all of them, Kobold King, being placed atop of a large cushiony throne atop of one of the crates. 

The sight of him ruling from on high tickled the goober deep inside of me.

And by the end of it, the EVI and I had come to a solid enough first prototype for the wand‚Äôs housing unit ‚Äî what amounted to a spherical metal orb capable of multi-axial rotation with a full six degrees of freedom mounted on a pole attached to the suit‚Äôs ‚Äòbackpack‚Äô. 

It honestly reminded me of one of those old mast mounted sights on helicopters and rotor-based craft. 

And it would‚Äôve probably looked more akin to that, if it was mounted on my head rather than my backpack.

Printing it out would require the sacrifice of a modest amount of metals, which the wealth cube provided in spades.

Though the estimated time to print and calibrate it‚Ä¶ probably meant I wouldn‚Äôt be able to use it tomorrow.

Regardless, the EVI now had its work cut out for it, as the printers within the tent got to work, and I finally managed to just *rest*. 

‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúEmma?‚Äù A familiar voice jolted me back to reality. ‚ÄúAre you feeling well?‚Äù Thacea asked, prompting me to snap my eyes towards the time on my HUD. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt tell if you were busy with your‚Ä¶ internal meditations, or if you were asleep inside of your armor.‚Äù

I let out a skittish yawn in response, stretching in the process. ‚ÄúI-it‚Äôs the latter, princess.‚Äù I managed out awkwardly. ‚ÄúThat probably wasn‚Äôt becoming of me, sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs quite alright.‚Äù The princess responded reassuringly, sitting opposite of me as we just took in the silence together. 

‚ÄúYou seem‚Ä¶ preoccupied with something, Thacea.‚Äù I finally broke the silence. ‚ÄúIs there something you wanted to talk about?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI was actually meaning to broach a similar sentiment, Emma.‚Äù The princess offered with a polite smile.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the House Choosing Ceremony, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù We spoke at *literally* the same time, talking over one another, causing both of our eyes to grow wide with mutual amusement, and lightening both our spirits.

‚ÄúYou read my mind, princess.‚Äù I chuckled.

‚ÄúIf only it were so easy‚Ä¶‚Äù Thacea politely reciprocated with a teasing giggle of her own.

‚ÄúThe armor sorta gets in the way of the fun of that, huh?‚Äù I shot back with a sly smirk and a cock of my head.

‚ÄúIndeed‚Ä¶ and so much more if I may add.‚Äù The princess began with a playful breath, eliciting a small chuckle from my end, before promptly and nervously jumping back into her concerned tone of voice. ‚ÄúMoreover, if I were to be so brazen, I assume that the armor is likewise the cause of your less than enthusiastic spirits about the ceremony?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs in the same vein, really. But it‚Äôs just a dumb silly concern; nothing serious.‚Äù I answered truthfully.

‚ÄúA concern is still a concern, Emma.‚Äù Thacea replied succinctly, urging me to spill the beans.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just a bit disappointing that I don‚Äôt get to be part of the ‚Äòaction‚Äô as it were. Like, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not one to ogle at magic. You‚Äôve seen what I‚Äôm capable of, so it‚Äôs nothing about lacking confidence to match it or anything. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, I guess I sorta just wish I could join in on the fun. It‚Äôs just a stupid thought, really.‚Äù I shrugged. 

‚ÄúI imagine most would be rejoicing at having the least amount of work in a collaborative effort, Emma.‚Äù Thacea countered with a sly chirp. 

This prompted me to reach the back of my head awkwardly. ‚ÄúWell erm‚Ä¶ heh, I guess I get a bit fidgety with nothing to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe adherence to personal responsibility is commendable.‚Äù Thacea acknowledged. ‚ÄúAnd your concern is one that I can both sympathize and empathize with.‚Äù 

That answer gave me the on-ramp I needed to address my own concerns, as I directed this impromptu therapy session right back at the princess. 

‚ÄúI imagine that‚Äôs probably because of your self-admitted reluctance to the House Choosing Ceremony from the onset, right?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù The princess nodded, going silent, before letting out a sigh in acknowledgement. ‚ÄúI am‚Ä¶ not very enthusiastic about displaying my magical capabilities. For as I stated previously, my‚Ä¶ *affliction* is one which is directly affected by my emotional state. And despite my learned self-control, the *risk* of overexertion leading to the exposure of even a *hint* of miasma, is a scenario which constantly hangs over my head.‚Äù 

I immediately leaned forward following that self-admission, attempting to bridge the gap, despite the layers of composalite in the way. 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this if you don‚Äôt want to, Thacea.‚Äù I offered earnestly.

‚ÄúYou misunderstand me, Emma. I can manage myself. I‚Ä¶ merely have concerns which only I must come to terms with.‚Äù The princess responded immediately. ‚ÄúI am not one to pull away from my obligations. This is something we likely have in common, yes?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I guess you‚Äôre right on the money in that regard, princess.‚Äù I acknowledged with a nod. ‚ÄúBut I just want you to know that you‚Äôre not alone in this, alright? Like I said on that very first day, I couldn‚Äôt give less of a crap about taint, miasma, or what-have-you. It‚Äôs all top-down Nexian bigotry to me.‚Äù I took a moment to let out a breath, as a smile slowly formed over my next few words. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with you all the way, Thacea.‚Äù

The princess‚Äô eyes widened at that, her typically composed gaze wavered if only for a moment, before she managed to recompose herself with a simple yet still-as-articulate response. ‚ÄúAs am I, Emma.‚Äù 

=====

**Dragon‚Äôs Heart Tower en route to the Hall of Champions. Local time: 0845.**

**Emma**

I managed to sleep in. 

Or at least, that‚Äôs what waking up at 8:30 felt like now given my schedule‚Ä¶ 

The opposite could be said for Ilunor however, as I met the blue thing in the living room jittering all about the place, a chalice of some brown-red liquid held tightly in one hand, and the scripts to his performance in the other.

A brief back and forth with the amused-looking Thalmin told me all that I needed to know. 

Not that it needed much pointing out.

‚ÄúOur Vunerian comrade has been downing rejuvenation spritzes and elixirs all night, Emma.‚Äù The prince chuckled. 

‚ÄúHOW CAN YOU BE SO CALM SO AS TO REGARD THIS GREATEST OF OPPORTUNITIES WITH SUCH NONCHALANCE, PRINCE THALMIN?!‚Äù The Vunerian shrieked out, his hand furiously working on the ‚Äòfinal touches‚Äô of the choreography for the show. 

The prince shrugged the nexian noble off as he responded simply. ‚ÄúNothing truly catches you off guard once you‚Äôve been ambushed in your breeches.‚Äù 

That response didn‚Äôt seem to sit well with the Vunerian, even as we made our way out of the room and back into the halls, en route to the House Choosing Ceremony.

‚ÄúYou know, there‚Äôs a quote from someone famous back home, Ilunor.‚Äù I began. ‚ÄúI think it goes something along the lines of: *‚ÄòTo achieve great things, two things are needed; a plan, and not quite enough time.‚Äô*‚Äù

‚ÄúTHAT‚ÄôS BECAUSE YOUR PEOPLE ARE OUT OF THEIR MINDS, CADET EMMA BOOKER!‚Äù The Vunerian shouted through a jittery breath, as I turned to the rest of the gang with a shrug, accepting the Vunerian‚Äôs excitements as an irreconcilable part of today‚Äôs happenings.

A few back and forths were had between the gang, with Thalmin seeming the most confident out of all of us, especially as we arrived back into the Victorian-esque gymnasium proper.

It was here, after walking through the front door dressing room, and back into the space of my greatest public victory yet, where we were ushered up towards the bleachers, filled to the brim with faces which the EVI did not recognize.

Though a quick glance at their school robes made it clear *exactly* who they were.

Upper yearsmen.

Indeed, about half of the stadium was currently packed with upper yearsmen, all of whom were seated beneath banners, giving off the vibes of a cross between the European Federation‚Äôs intense soccer culture, and a medieval-style tournament in the typical fantasy sense.

Though the former vibe was *strong* with this crowd, as some amongst the upper years went so far as to dress up in house colors, waving flags and banners of their houses as we arrived.

The mileage between the fervor of house pride *did* seem to decrease with each house though, as the maroon and orange house on the very left of the stadium seemed to be the most invested in displaying their pride, whilst the gray and white house on the very right seemed almost silent by comparison.

It was the middle of the stadium however that seemed to be the most dressed up for the occasion, as a massive stand rising up a good two-three stories rose up from the field, with a row of professors sitting behind the same banquet table as the one seen in the grand dining hall.

Though this time, the white cloth of the table was once again replaced by the intertwining colors of all four houses.

‚ÄúFirst-years of the Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts! Welcome! Welcome to the House Choosing Ceremony!‚Äù The dean proclaimed from the middle seat, standing up as he did so, prompting everyone in the stadium to follow suit.

‚ÄúIt is on this day that each peer group will have the chance to prove themselves in the eyes of the faculty. As your magical potential, and the means by which you wield it, will be ascertained and scrutinized; such that an objective score can be assigned to each peer group. Following which, the privilege of choosing your peer group‚Äôs house will be bestowed in order of most points, to the least points.‚Äù The Dean explained, more or less clearing up any confusions I had on exactly *why* this magical talent show was so important.

This system‚Ä¶ more or less fostered a de-facto state of hierarchical stratification. 

There was *no way* the highest scoring peer group would choose a house composed of lesser-scoring groups from the previous years.

And sure, there *might* have been a time where people acted in good faith, choosing houses based on their personalities or whatever.

But when was good faith ever the case with the Nexus?

‚ÄúTo these ends, I will allow the Protectors of each House to declare themselves. Following which, we will be accepting applications for the day‚Äôs demonstration timeslots.‚Äù The dean concluded, handing off the floor to four professors who stood up in rapid succession.

The first, being Vanavan, sporting a wizard‚Äôs hat dressed up in maroon and orange colors. ‚ÄúI represent House Shiqath, a proud house bearing the name of His Eternal Majesty‚Äôs first adventuring compatriot, Shiqath of Sanguine Ichor, Slayer of the Old Gods, First Inquisitor of the Realm.‚Äù

The maroon and orange house began cheering and hollering at that, drawing the attention of everyone in the stands.

The second to speak up was Professor Articord, sporting a cravat consisting of silver and bronze embroidery, matching the colors of the second house‚Äôs banners. ‚ÄúI represent House Finthorun, a storied house named in honor of His Eternal Majesty‚Äôs second adventuring  compatriot, whose legacy built the very foundations of the Academy we stand upon ‚Äî Gilded-Gleaming Finthorun. The man who slew the deep myths of old.‚Äù 

A similar, yet not as pronounced series of cheers quickly followed from the house in question.

Following this, the third to address the crowd would be Professor Chiska, who sported a large and almost comically long scarf, bearing earthy green and glistening blue colors that looked almost like flowing water. ‚ÄúI represent House Thun'Yundaris, the bold and brave house bearing the name of Fortressfell Thun'Yundaris. His Eternal Majesty‚Äôs third adventuring compatriot, the living citadel whose mountainous bravery and initiative tore the heavens asunder.‚Äù 

A series of soft golf claps followed Chiska‚Äôs announcement, earning a sharp glare from her, forcing out a series of begrudging hoots and hollers from her house. 

The end of these proclamations was marked by Belnor‚Äôs unenthused announcement, as she stood up and quickly adjusted her stone gray and luminous white shawl. ‚ÄúI represent House Vikzhura, of Garn Vikzhura, His Eternal Majesty‚Äôs fourth compatriot.‚Äù 

Belnor seemed to stop there, garnering the perplexed look of the rest of the faculty, which prompted her to sigh as she quickly added. ‚ÄúThe pathfinder who brought forth the light of truth to the deepest and darkest depths of evil, paving the way for righteous triumph.‚Äù 

A series of slow claps followed this, which transitioned right into the more laborious part of the morning‚Äôs activities.

Roll call.

Or more specifically ‚Äî time slot management.

This went on for *forever*, or precisely thirty minutes, but at least Ilunor got what he wanted from it. 

‚ÄúAnd to Lord Rularia‚Äôs peer group, goes the final time slot of the day!‚Äù 

The last time slot.

Following which, the dean finally stood up once more.  

‚ÄúThank you to all professors for representing your houses, and to Professor Chiska, for your excellent management of time.‚Äù The feline professor bowed in response, just as the dean turned back to the gathered students. ‚ÄúYou will all have precisely one hour before the first magical pageantry commences. May you all use this time wisely.‚Äù 

That announcement was quickly followed up by the departure of the entire year group, as it was clear everyone was going back to make their final preparations.

The same could be said for the rest of the gang, save for me, as I promptly approached Chiska in the midst of the crowd. 

‚ÄúDo you have a moment, professor?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, Cadet Emma Booker?‚Äù The professor nodded, deploying a privacy spell in the process.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 300% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôll allow me to be blunt, professor, I have a very important question I need to ask.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBy all means.‚Äù Chiska responded warily, as if waiting for a bombshell to drop, heightening up my concerns over some malicious involvement in Rila‚Äôs well being.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Rila?‚Äù 

‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúOh! Is that what you were worried about?‚Äù The professor‚Äôs features lightened up almost immediately. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd assumed this had something to do with today‚Äôs activities or something of that nature.‚Äù She clarified, before returning back to her jovial self. ‚ÄúI am a mage of my vows, Cadet Emma Booker. I not only know where Rila is, but I can take you to her, if you so desire.‚Äù 

My heart skipped a beat at that, as I couldn‚Äôt believe I finally hit a breakthrough moment.

And it didn‚Äôt even require jury-rigging a drone, or even grappling like a goober, to accomplish.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like that very much, actually.‚Äù

=====

**The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. En Route to the Healing Wing. Local Time: 0910 Hours.**

**Emma**

In the spirit of cosmic balance, it would seem that the expediting of one questline meant the complications of another. I could only hope that the gang wouldn‚Äôt be too mad at my momentary absence.

The first part of our walk towards the healing wing was strangely silent.

However, this eventually changed as the crowds cleared the closer we got to the healing wing. 

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 300% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

But only after the application of a cone of silence.

‚ÄúI am certain you may have some questions, Cadet Emma Booker.‚Äù She began, her tone of voice mixed somewhere between her usual upbeat demeanor, and a sense of serious apprehension. ‚ÄúI am giving you the opportunity to ask, though please do keep your questions within reason. I can only answer so much, after all.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOf course, professor.‚Äù I acknowledged. ‚ÄúFirst off, if everything with Rila is as I‚Äôd expect it to be, then I just wanted to give you my preemptive thanks for keeping your promise.‚Äù 

The professor perked up a brow at this, as she leveled a sly yet calculating gaze my way. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be too quick to dispense gratitudes just yet.‚Äù  

‚ÄúWha‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich is to say, I can neither confirm nor dismiss your concerns, since I am without knowledge of what it is you are expecting.‚Äù The professor promptly interjected with a polite and reassuring smile.

‚ÄúOh, right, sorry. I‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ I expect her to be in decent health for one. As in, being provided the best care that‚Äôs available.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs one might expect, yes.‚Äù The professor acknowledged with a nod. 

‚ÄúSecondly, I expect that she‚Äôd be‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ how do I say this politely‚Ä¶‚Äù I took a moment to pause, thinking my words through carefully. ‚ÄúI expect her to be the exact same when she‚Äôs discharged, as she was when she was being admitted.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äò*The same*‚Äô in regards to‚Ä¶?‚Äù Chiska insisted.

‚ÄúWell, to be blunt professor ‚Äî *with regards to* any binding spells or contracts or what-have-you.‚Äù I stated plainly. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say that out of the *many* good things I have to say about the wonderful world of magic, that these two topics have come close to spoiling the whole experience for me.‚Äù I added in as diplomatic of an approach as I could. 

Chiska regarded those words with a contemplative nod, breaking my gaze for just a moment to admire the view outside ‚Äî most notably, the fields surrounding the gymnasium currently brimming with magical activity.

‚ÄúSpeaking frankly, Cadet Emma Booker, I believe that is a sentiment shared between both you and I.‚Äù The professor spoke with a level of earnesty I hadn‚Äôt yet seen from anyone but Sorecar‚Ä¶ though perhaps a bit more restrained and composed than the aforementioned armorer. ‚ÄúTo those ends, I can assure you that there has been nothing of the sort done to Trade Apprentice Lartia-Siv-Rel. For so long as she is in my care, I have assured that all will be ‚Äò*as expected*‚Äô from our promise.‚Äù

My eyes narrowed at one specific detail, despite the initial sense of elation from Chiska‚Äôs rather altruistic views. ‚ÄúLartia-Siv-*Rel*, professor?‚Äù I attempted to clarify in as few words as I could, garnering a cock of the feline.

‚ÄúPerceptive.‚Äù The professor nodded with respect. ‚ÄúEither you‚Äôve had prior contact with the girl, or perhaps you‚Äôve simply picked up quite a bit of knowledge on Nexian class-nomenclature.‚Äù Chiska allowed that to hang in the air for a moment, a sly grin painted across her face, before moving forward. ‚ÄúRegardless of which it is, I am afraid I cannot divulge anything more as it pertains to that topic. It would be *rude* of me to tackle such a sensitive matter firmly within the realm of personal affairs. However, I am certain that your *perceptiveness* will lead you to discerning an answer one way or another.‚Äù The professor added with a wink, finishing off her end of the conversation just as we arrived in the healing wing proper. 

This was probably the *first* time I‚Äôd entered the healing wing‚Äôs wards without risking disciplinary action. 

It felt almost weird to be entering its halls, instead of being told off by some apprentice. 

It felt even *weirder* to be let through with just a nod from the attending apprentice, and to be let into the bowels of the tower which I‚Äôd just scaled a week ago. 

Just as expected‚Ä¶ things felt far *bigger* on the inside than they had any business of being. 

Though thankfully, this *bigness* only applied to two axes, as the long walk up more or less confirmed that verticality was at least still within the realm of euclidean normality.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here.‚Äù The professor announced, gesturing towards one of the many identical doors in the sterile whitestone and granite tile halls. 

I felt a bit of apprehension as the professor pushed the door open, my whole body tensing as despite the promises and reassurances, there was still that latent fear that this could be a trap‚Ä¶ or worse.

Though perhaps a part of me, the part of me expecting *normality*, was also concerned about the more grounded issues ‚Äî namely her state of health. 

All of these concerns eventually came to a head as we finally entered the room, my eyes and sensors darting towards a lone figure on a lofty bed made of dark, aged wood encrusted in socketed crystals. 

‚ÄúRila?‚Äù I managed out, taking several tentative strides forwards towards her bedside.

That single word managed to stir the scrub-wearing elf from her malaise, her eyes practically lighting up as soon as they locked on my helmet.

1h9nc8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiveparents/comments/1h9nc8k/dont_know_im_being_abused/,Don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm being abused ,"I‚Äôm 17 and trying to figure out whether I‚Äôm being abused by my mum or if I‚Äôm the problem. It‚Äôs really confusing because our relationship is so complicated.

When I was younger, my mum used to get angry very quickly and sometimes physically hurt me. She‚Äôd also often tell me to kill myself which led me to consider it multiple times, wrapping the cord of my blinds around my neck. As I got older (early-teens), we talked about it. She explained how depressed and alone she felt after having me (she had post-natal depression), especially since my dad wasn‚Äôt really around and was abusive towards her at the time. She also shared that he cheated on her multiple times. She apologised and admitted she was in the wrong. I forgave her because she‚Äôs my mum, and I do feel like she can be a good parent. We‚Äôve had a lot of chill moments where we laugh and get along really well, but it feels like she can turn so quickly.

Fast forward to now‚Äîour fights have lessened in frequency, but now I can stand up for myself. I had anorexia for years, and during arguments, she would throw it in my face. That hurt, but I figured it was just something people do when they‚Äôre upset.

2 weeks ago, I was in a traumatic car accident where I was hit by a speeding car that ran a red as a pedestrian. I fractured my spine and am awaiting results from my pelvic MRI as I find it hard to walk. I also am receiving counselling for PTSD and travel anxiety.  Today, we argued over something small before getting into the car. While driving, she started braking hard and threatening to crash. This sent me into a panic attack, and I started hyperventilating. When I said I wanted to get out and I would call the police, she threatened to kill me. She eventually drove me home, but it was terrifying.

On the way she stopped the car,  telling me to just ‚Äúget over it‚Äù because I‚Äôll ‚Äústart shit‚Äù between her and my dad if I keep bringing it up. I told her to just not talk to me because I‚Äôm so traumatised by what she did. She scared me so much, and this is the one time I feel like I can‚Äôt forgive her. I‚Äôve managed to forgive her even after she was physical with me when I was younger, but after the trauma I‚Äôve experienced from the accident, I just can‚Äôt.

After we got home I went straight to my room but soon after, she acted like nothing happened. She came into my room asking me to look at something and wouldn‚Äôt stop. When I said no firmly, she said, ‚ÄúSee, you‚Äôre acting like my mum.‚Äù I told her I didn‚Äôt want a relationship with her anymore, and that‚Äôs where I‚Äôve left things for now.

Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused: My mum says I‚Äôm the abuser in our relationship. She accuses me of gaslighting and being controlling. For instance, if she‚Äôs on her phone and struggling, I might show her shortcuts to help her. She interprets this as me trying to control her.

The argument that led to the driving incident started because she needed to get change from her purse but was holding too many things and asked me to hold her coffee cup. I decided to grab the change for her to help as her purse was open, but she got mad, saying I was being controlling. In front of everyone, she started swearing and accused me of making a scene when I didn‚Äôt think I did anything wrong.

She also says I only care about material things. That same day, we‚Äôd had lunch, gotten our nails done, and bought clothes for an upcoming holiday. She accused me of being nicer to my dad because ‚Äúhe has the money,‚Äù which isn‚Äôt true. She brought up a time I messaged my dad to buy me shoes, but she‚Äôs the one who told me to ask him as he works in the city so it‚Äôs convenient for him to get them. I‚Äôve never thought of money as my family is well-off and we‚Äôve always been comfortable. For me, it doesn‚Äôt matter and that day i was just grateful to spend time with her.  

I feel like no matter what I do, it‚Äôs wrong. When she yells, I try to stay calm and talk quietly, but then she says my tone is condescending and superior. I admit I‚Äôve called her ‚Äúinsecure‚Äù or ‚Äúinsane‚Äù during fights, but only after years of avoiding those words. Now, she calls me a gaslighter and says I abuse her emotionally.

For context about my dad: He was abusive to my mum for many years but has never been abusive to me. He doesn‚Äôt really remember those days as he‚Äôs changed, which obviously hurts my mum a lot. They‚Äôre not in a proper relationship anymore and bicker quite a bit. It‚Äôs made my relationship with him challenging because, while he never hurt me, I had to witness him abuse her, and that has affected how I see him. Our relationship is doing somewhat okay now, though I‚Äôm closer to my mum. 

I don‚Äôt know what to think anymore. I don‚Äôt feel like an abuser, but I also don‚Äôt want her to feel hurt or controlled by me. I also understand that she‚Äôs been through a lot and for the most part our relationship is ‚Äúpicture perfect.‚Äù 

Im not sure what to do. Firstly, I don‚Äôt know if this is abuse and secondly, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm right in saying I don‚Äôt want a relationship.

This year I decided to use this free weekend to meet some interesting new people, chat, share interests, break the mold and broaden my social circle. Whether it's an offline event or online networking, I'm happy to give it a try.



I've always believed that the power of friends can't be underestimated, especially when you're trying to find some moments of relaxation and enjoyment in your busy life. Everyone's stories and opinions can give you a different perspective and can even inspire you. So today I'm in a happy mood, full of anticipation and hoping to meet some like-minded people.



I've been living in Los Angeles for a while now and love the diversity and vibrancy of the city. On the weekends I like to participate in various activities such as going to fitness classes, going to museums, or sitting at different coffee shops around the city. I have a wide range of interests and love to share with my friends about movies, music, travel or food, and I also enjoy hearing other people's stories and experiences.



If you also enjoy connecting with people or want to explore something new together, whether it's a cultural event, a sport, or just a social gathering, message me and we can talk and get to know each other. If you're in LA, or have similar interests, you're welcome to reach out to me as well! The most important thing for me is to be able to make genuine connections and meet more interesting people with ease and pleasure.



I hope to meet someone here who loves life as much as you do. Let's have a great time relaxing together, making new friends and enjoying the weekend!



Looking forward to hearing from you\~ üòä

No routine = no time.

The accountability of someone coming to my flat at 8am would wake me up. They chill with a cup of tea or whatever then we both leave at 9. 

I'm considering posting on Airtasker or similar. Does anyone know if ADHD coaches or similar offer a service like this? Would a proper ADHD coach be better?   
Or if you were to advertise on Gumtree how would you do it to maintain safety (eg someone DRB checked would be good)?

Before you ask, I've tried to get myself up and establish a routine for 10+ years including seeing doctors, sleep study, melatonin/sleeping aids, sleep hygiene, Alarmy alarm clocks on 3x phones at different places in the flat, family members calling me, accountability buddy at my co work space, having to scan a bar code in the shower before the alarm will turn off, Sonic Bomb alarm, gradual light alarm clocks etc etc - you name it.

I am prescribed amphetamine and on some days I can rouse myself enough to take the literal amphetamine, down a cup of cold black coffee by my bed, crank open the blinds to full sunlight in my face and STILL fall back on the pillow and stay asleep for hours.    
  
Sometimes I can have good spells of 4,5 days in a row when I'm awake at 8 but still faff about for hours in the morning.

I never miss a flight, and if someone like a tradesman has to come to my flat in the morning, I can always wake up to let them in.  
The science behind this is there's clearly enough cortisol being produced in those situations to wake up. (Melatonin > Cortisol. Interplays with > Dopamine.) Social obligation is also scientifically a huge motivator. I can't replicate that stress enough myself every day. I have no kids or spouse or pets or boss.

Any alternatives or other better options, I‚Äôm not aware of? Capital One neutered the Savor card to 3% - there are dozens of 3% dining cards (I‚Äôve had PNC Cash Rewards for almost a decade). Maybe I just switch to my 3% card on vacations?

And the magnitude of change seems disproportionate to what we know about coffee and cholesterol..

As some of you may know, there's a couple decades worth of data that seems to show unfiltered coffee raises LDL cholesterol, particularly in men. The data seems to show coffee is safe nonetheless, but filtered coffee appears to not have the same impact. ""Cafestol and kahweol raise the serum concentration of cholesterol and triglycerides in humans"" and filtering seems to mitigate this.

I'm late 30s, healthy, active, BMI under 25, vegetarian, high cholesterol, family history of high cholesterol. My doctor laughed out loud when she saw the first test results.

Decided to start sticking 58mm paper filters at the bottom of the basket of my Cafelat Robot and see what happens. Made no intentional/conscious effort to change my diet or exercise habits other than this. The results were pretty striking. I notice no changes to taste or texture, but I also exclusively make turbo shots so I'm not so focused on texture.

As stated above, the magnitude of the change seems too large to be solely attributable to filtering two to three espresso a day, but who knows, maybe I'm extremely sensitive or something. At the very least, the filters are literally a penny and aren't doing any harm.

My partner and I are both struggling to get soberish. I have tendency towards stimulant abuse, especially when drinking and being around folks who use as well. Pretty standard doing blow til it's gone, horrible come down, horrible guilt spiral the next day. My partner has expressed basically that I need to get it together and sober up because he can't stay sober from blow if I'm using it. So I'm working really hard to improve both for myself and for our relationship. We slip up and try to be understanding- we are both deep in the punk/music/diy scenes in our town and it's pretty prevalent. Basically in order to hang out after shows you have to decline offers. Which I can't do when I drink. So, I've stopped going to shows, stopped getting drunk when I do go, and leave as soon as my hankering rears it's head. I can feel it on my shoulder just talking about it now, and im sober still having breakfast. 

My partner drinks too much. From what I can tell, if he uses cocaine it's not a complete spin out like it is for me. He can decide to stop after a few and go to bed, where as I can't walk away if there's any left do to. But he will drink 6-8 beers at home alone after I go to bed. He's a night owl and I'm an early bird, so we decompress at different times. It feels like after i go to sleep, he drinks and watchs tv, when he's asleep im drinking coffee and cleaning house. He still has to attend shows as he is building a career in the music industry. I feel like half the time he says he will be home that night, and then ends up crashing at a friend's house because he gets too drunk. Which I've been fine with in the past- I trust him. But recently other people have begun to say that he's out using while I'm at home worrying about him. I've asked him to text me when he ends up staying out, I've asked him to watch how much he drinks, specifically asked him if he was staying out last night and he said no. I haven't heard from him since he left last night. He was active on Instagram about two hours ago. Which feels crazy but like how else would I know if he's okay.

It's just hard not to feel like, resentful? That it feels like I'm trying and he's not? And when I slip up he's pretty callous about it and it makes me feel really really bad and emotional, when im coming down all I want is to be loved and held and he's either asleep or withholding, which is my own thing to deal with, I can't demand affection of course- but when he slips up im really nice and patient about it.

TLDR trying to get sober as a team is causing a pretty significant rift in my relationship right now, any advice to support myself and my goals is welcome. ",4,1733676363.0,altsober,5,0.84,False

---------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become one of the most sought-after cosmetic dental procedures. It's not surprising that many people consider it, especially when they dream of a brighter smile. The impact of teeth whitening can be extraordinary, changing not just the shade of your teeth but also boosting your confidence. Let‚Äôs delve into the transformations that take place before and after this popular procedure.

### What to Expect Before Teeth Whitening

Before undergoing a teeth whitening procedure, it's crucial to establish realistic expectations. Many individuals often go through several stages that prepare them for the change ahead:

- **Consultation:** A visit to your dentist is essential to determine if you are a suitable candidate for teeth whitening. Sensitive teeth or existing dental issues may require special consideration.
- **Initial Assessment:** Before starting, the dentist typically assesses the current color of your teeth. Photos may be taken for a clear comparison later on.
- **Cleaning:** A professional cleaning ensures that plaque and stains are removed, which can enhance the results of the whitening treatment.

Understanding these steps can help set the stage for the upcoming transformation.

### The Whitening Process

On the day of your appointment, the actual teeth whitening process usually unfolds in a couple of different ways. Here are some common methods to lighten your teeth:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This method employs powerful bleaching agents. The treatment can last from 30 to 90 minutes, yielding immediate results.
- **At-Home Kits:** Your dentist might provide custom trays and a bleaching solution to use at home, allowing for gradual whitening over several days or weeks.

Each method has its pros and cons, but both can significantly enhance your smile.

### After the Teeth Whitening Procedure

Once the procedure is complete, you'll likely be eager to see the changes. The most noticeable effect will be the brightness of your teeth. Many people report feeling more confident about their appearance immediately. However, the impacts extend beyond just aesthetics:

- **Boosted Confidence:** A whiter smile can lead to improved self-esteem. You may find yourself smiling more often in social situations.
- **Improved Oral Hygiene Habits:** After whitening, many people become more diligent about their dental hygiene, which contributes to lasting results.
- **Renewed Motivation:** A bright smile often encourages individuals to maintain it through regular dental check-ups and good oral care practices.

Aftercare is just as important. Avoid certain foods and drinks, like coffee or red wine, for the first few days post-treatment to maintain that fresh look.

### Before and After Transformations

The best part of teeth whitening is seeing the dramatic before and after results. Photos taken before the treatment often showcase dull, stained teeth, while after results reveal a notably brighter smile. The transformation speaks for itself:

- **Increased Brightness:** Many individuals see results that are several shades lighter. This brightness can enhance facial features and create a youthful appearance.
- **Enhanced Facial Expressions:** A brighter smile encourages natural habits, like smiling more often and expressing happiness, which can positively affect your social interactions.
- **Greater First Impressions:** Studies show that people with whiter teeth often make better first impressions, reflecting health and cleanliness.

These transformations can be empowering, and the ripple effect often extends into various aspects of one‚Äôs life, from personal relationships to professional opportunities.

### Maintaining Your Whiter Smile

After you've enjoyed the benefits of teeth whitening, maintaining that beautiful smile is paramount. Simple practices can help prolong the effects:

- **Regular Brushing:** Brush twice a day with a whitening toothpaste to sustain brightness.
- **Limit Staining Foods:** Be mindful of foods and drinks that can stain your teeth. Moderation is key.
- **Schedule Follow-Up Treatments:** Consider touch-up treatments every few months based on your dentist's recommendations.

The journey of teeth whitening is one filled with anticipation and excitement. The ""before"" photos capture the starting line, while the ""after"" photos reflect a newfound confidence and a striking smile. Making informed decisions about your teeth whitening adventure can ensure lasting results, turning your aesthetic dreams into a shining reality.

Different Teeth Whitening Methods and Their Visible Results
-----------------------------------------------------------

Whitening your teeth is a popular way to enhance your smile and boost your confidence. Many people are curious about the various methods available and the visible results they offer. This overview will guide you through different teeth whitening methods, illustrating their effectiveness and typical before-and-after results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Professional In-Office Whitening

Professional in-office teeth whitening is often regarded as the most effective method. This process usually involves a dentist applying a powerful whitening agent to your teeth. A special light or laser may be used to activate the whitening substance, accelerating the bleaching process.

**Before and After:** Patients commonly see a noticeable difference in just one session, with teeth appearing several shades lighter. Results can range from three to eight shades lighter, depending on your initial tooth color and the product used.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### At-Home Whitening Kits

At-home whitening kits are a convenient alternative for those who prefer to whiten their teeth at their own pace. These kits typically contain lower concentrations of bleaching agents compared to in-office treatments, making them safer for unsupervised use.

**Before and After:** Over a few weeks, users can generally achieve a lighter shade of their teeth, often around two to four shades. However, the results may take longer to show compared to professional treatments.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Whitening Toothpaste

Many commercial toothpaste brands now offer whitening formulas. These products either contain mild abrasives to polish teeth or include chemical agents that help break down stains.

**Before and After:** While whitening toothpaste can help remove surface stains, the overall change in color is often minimal. Users typically notice a subtle difference, often achieving only one or two shades lighter after prolonged use.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Whitening Strips

Whitening strips are thin, flexible plastic strips coated with a whitening gel. They are placed directly over the teeth and left on for a specific amount of time, usually around 30 minutes.

**Before and After:** After using these strips consistently for a couple of weeks, you may notice a change of two to three shades lighter. Many users find this method to be effective and affordable.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### LED Whitening Devices

At-home LED whitening devices have gained popularity in recent years. These kits often combine a whitening gel with an LED light, which claims to speed up the whitening process.

**Before and After:** Users can typically see results of two to five shades lighter after several treatments. Results may vary based on the frequency of use and the concentration of the whitening gel.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Natural Remedies

Some people opt for natural whitening methods, such as baking soda or activated charcoal. While these substances can help scrub away surface stains, they may not be as effective as commercial products.

**Before and After:** Users might see slight improvements over time but should not expect dramatic results. Typically, any lightening effect is limited to one shade or less.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Maintaining Whitened Teeth

After using any teeth whitening method, it's essential to take steps to maintain your beautiful results. Here are some tips for keeping your smile bright:

- Avoid foods and drinks known to stain teeth, such as coffee, tea, red wine, and berries.
- Maintain good oral hygiene by brushing twice a day and flossing regularly.
- Use a straw when drinking beverages that can stain your teeth to minimize contact.
- Schedule regular cleanings with your dentist to remove surface stains and plaque.

Whether you opt for professional treatment or a DIY method, each approach has its visible results and effectiveness. Deciding which teeth whitening method suits your lifestyle and desired outcome will help ensure a radiant smile you're proud to show off. With the right choice, you can achieve impressive before-and-after results that enhance your facial aesthetics.

Monitor your progress, and don‚Äôt hesitate to consult with your dentist for professional advice tailored to your specific needs. Happy whitening!

### Conclusion

Seeing the changes that teeth whitening can bring is truly inspiring. The transformations from before to after can boost your confidence, enhance your smile, and even improve how you feel about yourself. It's remarkable how a brighter smile can change your demeanor and the way others perceive you.

As you explore the various teeth whitening methods available, you‚Äôll discover that each option‚Äîfrom professional treatments to DIY solutions‚Äîoffers different results.

Remember that the journey to whiter teeth doesn‚Äôt stop after one treatment. Maintaining your results is just as important as achieving them initially. Good oral hygiene, regular dental visits, and being mindful of staining foods and drinks can help extend the longevity of your beautiful smile.

Choosing to whiten your teeth is more than just an aesthetic decision; it's a step towards greater self-assurance. As you consider your choices, keep in mind the potential positive impact of your brighter smile. After all, the radiant confidence that comes with a transformed smile is invaluable.

They have since emerged from bankruptcy and are back trading on NASDAQ.  As part of their BK exit, I was granted various warrants which are tradeable under separate tickers CORZZ and CORZW.   I currently have around $190k to $200k in gains (including warrants) and CORZ current market cap is $4.8B.

**Conversion to HPC Datacenter Hosting:**  During this past summer, the CEO Adam Sullivan , made a strategic decision to change the Company's business model from a pure bitcoin miner to HPC hosting.  The Company during a short period of time signed CoreWeave to 3 large contracts locking up 500MW of existing critical IT load.  These CoreWeave contracts will generate $8.7B of revenue over 12 years at 75% margins.  CoreWeave pays for all of the capex, power and utilities, and is backed by Nvidia,  Cisco and Blackstone.  This revenue will scale up starting in Q1 2025 with the project fully being onboarded by Q4 2026 generating annual revenue of $725M a year for the next 12 years.

CORZ believes they can unlock an additional 300MW of Critical IT load at existing sites, and they have found another 400MW of Critical IT load at new sites.   This will allow CORZ to secure 1.2GW of Critical IT load by 2027, according to Adam.  CORZ also just announced raising a $550M 0% convertible note, which may be used for capex and to acquire additional HPC sites.  Notes are convertible at $22.49, well above the current SP.

**Bitcoin Mining:**  While no longer the primary focus of the Company, they still have 20.4 EH/s of self mining hash rate, making them one of the top 5 miners in the U.S. with monthly self mined bitcoin approximating 330 to 350 bitcoins.  They also signed an agreement with Block, Inc in 2024 to acquire 15 EH/s of their new 3nm ASIC chip for bitcoin mining, which may have a material impact on their mining operations by increasing EH and updating their existing fleet.  I would expect an increase in CORZ EH over the next 6 months while also lowering their cost to mine as these new chips and miners are deployed and upgraded.

**Argument for Continued Hodling:** 

With all of that being said, the CEO has made several statements regarding the Company's valuation and said he believes CORZ valuation should approximate $20B to $25B once the market starts viewing them as an HPC datacenter compared to just a bitcoin miner (current market cap is $4.8B)   A market cap of $20B would equate to a share price of $55 to $65 compared to the current share price of $16 to $18.  While not an identical businesses,  $EQIX has 725MW of datacenters and a market cap of $95B, and given the differences and similarities in the two businesses, a market cap of $20B does seem attainable for CORZ.  If CORZ hits a market cap north of $20B, it should push my gains up to $700k plus.  

**Argument for Selling:**

CORZ in my opinion is still more closely aligned with Bitcoin mining vs. HPC hosting.  It goes up and down with bitcoin.  The conversion to HPC is in its early stages,  is highly complex, and is the 75% plus profit margin that Adam touted truly attainable? I don't necessarily understand how the CoreWeave's $725M annual run rate of revenue, even with $540M of margin, drives the valuation up to $20B. I would think they need to double that margin and have 1GW committed under contract and how many years will that take? They will be tied up through 2026 onboarding CoreWeave, do they really have the capacity to onboard a number of other new customers and how does the supply chain look for HPCs to meet that demand.    In the meantime, if bitcoin starts a downward trend, so would my current gains.

**Final Thought:**

Should I take a win and move on, or let it all keep riding.  Has anyone else been following Core Scientific and what are your opinions on the current and future valuations / achievable HPC plan?  I'm inclined to go for glory or bust, but those in my inner circle (wife's boyfriend) keep telling me to sell. 

Below are snips showing my gains. I hold CORZ and warrants (CORZZ and CORZW) in two different broker accounts and they have 3 tickers, 1 for the stock and 2 for the different warrants they granted to shareholders at bankruptcy exit, so annoying to pull together but see below snapshot.

Hello everyone, I've been considering a grinder upgrade since I'm perpetually frustrated with dialing in.

**Some background and current setup:**

Currently I own a Mara X v2, which is a great machine on paper, but the slow pressure ramp-up is always confusing when it comes to dial in based on standard parameters.

Trusting many advices and good reviews, I matched the machine with an Eureka Mignon Zero, which I paid a reasonable price for, being in Italy.

As I am extremely prone to modding and getting my hands dirty, I 3D printed a nice dial for the grinder, aligned the burrs (as good as I could), so I guess any possible upgrade to the grinder is already made.

I have set the OPV to 8 bars, do regular maintenance and cleaning, do WDT and RDT, use only IMS filter baskets (reasonably priced in italy) and use specialty/single origin coffee from italian roasters.

The problem is that I can't get a coffee shop level coffee, though every component should be fine, so I'm considering an upgrade to the grinder.

I also own a Flair classic, and like to do something different around twice/week (v60, chemex, aeropress)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
**Location**: Italy  
**Preferred drink types:** 95% espresso, 5% v60/chemex, 1% aeropress  
**Drink frequency**: around 4/day  
**Space**: not a problem, I can make space if necessary  
**Experience level**: I worked in my family's caf√® for 10 years (not specialty, just regular italian caf√®); +5 years of home experience  
**Manual/Electric**: Manual is ok if worth, but like Pietro manual, not portable things; Electric is preferred though  
**Candidates**: Here I should have access to some nice Italian based options for a good price, like Mazzer, Eureka, Fiorenzato, rancilio and others, so these brands should be on top of the list. Also, amazon-IT directly sells turin/miicoffee grinders.  
I have considered the Pietro, Eureka atom, Fiorenzato all ground, but also the df83v and Niche duo.  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Wrap up:**

My main question is if I should work around my Mignon and get better in dialing in since the hardware should be able to achieve coffee-shop level specialty, or I could make my life easier with an upgrade.

**In case you may think I should upgrade, thank you for your suggestion and consider that:**

I always jump between different beans (that may contribute to my frustration);  
The ideal grinder should work with both filter and espresso, but main focus is espresso here, so I'm ok getting maybe a manual grinder for filter and going for a espresso-only-focused grinder;  
I drink medium to light roast;  
I'm not trying to improve workflow, grinding speed or ease-of-use, but shot quality.

**Many thanks in advance to anyone for your time, and have a nice coffee.**",1,1733675621.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Normally, I don‚Äôt date younger women, especially those under 21, but she has completely surprised me with how mature and intelligent she is. We started talking as friends, exchanged numbers, and over the past couple of months, we've grown really close. We talk about everything, and we‚Äôve both expressed that we‚Äôre attracted to each other and have talked about HOW MUCH we click. I‚Äôve been upfront with her about my feelings, but last week, she told me she thinks we should just be friends because she‚Äôs focusing on her mental health and can‚Äôt handle a relationship at the moment, which I totally respect and understand.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm torn, though: despite her saying we should just be friends, she does things that make me second-guess her intentions. For example, a customer was being flirty with me (which I wasn‚Äôt responding to at all), and I could clearly see it bothered her. She still texts me good morning and good night every day, and we chat constantly about our lives and what we want from life. She even bought me a small teddy bear for my car mirror, along with some gum and coffee, she sprayed it with a perfume she knows I like. I catch her staring at me all the time and when I look back, she quickly looks away and blushes. Shevcalls me cute pet names and is always flirting with me. If we're not together we're texting each other.

All of this has me thinking about her constantly and has me going insane. Honestly, I‚Äôve never connected with anyone like this before. So, I‚Äôm stuck‚Äîshould I push forward and try to pursue a relationship with her, or do I stick with the ‚Äújust friends‚Äù approach and respect her boundaries?

As the winter months are ongoing, I was wondering what's the best way to increase the body energy and keep it up through the day.

I'm someone who doesn't drink tea/coffee/alcohol, sleeps late at night and hence gets up late, and even after 8-9 hours of sleep, I feel like sleeping the whole day. I don't do much of physical activity through the week (maybe that's another reason of feeling lethargic) but I try to bike every day a bit. Also, my diet is not completely healthy but not horrible too.

My Vitamin D, iron and whatever other levels may be low, and there's no way GP will test them just like that, which is fair. My question is - are there any supplements which can help in uplifting the energy (without much side effects) and boost the overall body mechanism?

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I‚Äôve mentioned in my post, it‚Äôs up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on ‚Äúhey‚Äù or smalltalk responses.

Thanks for reading :). ",0,1733675422.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

I am currently on 125mg daily of Topiramate, Botox protocol every 3 months, and Rizatriptan as needed. 

I have been feeling fantastic ever since I started Botox and when I got diagnosed with adhd - thought meds would help to reduce stress. 

I took them two days in a row and while my life was changed mentally - physically I went back to a dark place due to head pain. The headaches were awful. 

The Reddit threads in vyvanse just say drink more water but as someone who has chronic migraine - I‚Äôm already drinking 3.5 litres of water a day. So I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs my issue. 

I limit caffeine - I have 1 cup of weak coffee a day. 

Anyone have experience with this med and chronic migraine? Did they wear down a bit? Or should I explore some other meds? Or just try some natural adhd coping mechanisms - I‚Äôm scared to fall back into a massive flare and bed in bed again every night.

Why doesn‚Äôt he just holds back to shit in a more appropriate place inside his house ( we see him sitting on a toilet in the manga).
In later episodes, he even says that it takes time to produce the drug that uses his poop, he shouldn‚Äôt waste time shitting in his garden, it wastes a lot of time to collect it. He should make sure that it‚Äôs easy to collect.

I counted calories for about an year in the past and my TDEE tends to be around 1600-1700. I am tall but my body doesn't like to keep muscle mass. I will lose an year of muscle gains within 1-2 months of not exercising. So, it's just bones and fat mostly. I previously did intermittent fasting but quit last year as my work didn't give me the flexibility to have lunch before 4pm.

My typical day goes like this:

Wakeup ~5-5:30am.
Breakfast around 10am : **400 calories** ( 2 eggs + one toast) + coffee
Lunch around 2-3pm : **500** calories
Evening tea with milk and sugar: **100 calories**
Dinner around 8-9pm: **500** calories

This adds up around 1500 calories but even this is too much for my TDEE as this only creates a deficit of ~150cal/day or ~1000 cal/week. It hurts me because 1000 calories is about a slice of chocolate cake and it can very easily be undone. This is my issue. And forget creating a deficit, even eating at my TDEE consistently needs such conscious effort, I hate it. It's draining and I say fuck it and give up most weeks. Anytime I let go of being conscious of my diet, I gain weight. Life gets hard, you might be focusing on something else, may be your career, or your parents health, you don't have the mental capacity to be conscious about your diet on bad days. Some days, you might be so stressed and eating nice food activates your parasympathetic system.  I feel like I don't have that margin for error. Even eating out once a week is enough to make me gain weight. I hate it because I enjoy food. This has created an ""all or nothing"" mindset for me.

My avg calories intake for the last 4 months is probably around 2400 and I am gaining weight. Does anybody have any advice on how to stop this vicious cycle?

WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of Atalantanet streaming, it‚Äôs made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt really a good place to watch sports online. I‚Äôve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!



But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?



Awesome, right? 



I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn‚Äôt even have to sign up!



If you‚Äôve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service. 



It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren‚Äôt even in my region. It‚Äôs practically heaven on Earth!



But let‚Äôs delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don‚Äôt give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn‚Äôt even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I‚Äôm getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn‚Äôt the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn‚Äôt on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn‚Äôt do you any good to have access to all these games if you can‚Äôt see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your Atalantanet can handle it, anyway. But don‚Äôt worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I‚Äôve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn‚Äôt have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what‚Äôs the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything‚Äôs buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don‚Äôt have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn‚Äôt have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn‚Äôt be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I‚Äôve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.

It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren‚Äôt even in my region. It‚Äôs practically heaven on Earth!



But let‚Äôs delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don‚Äôt give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn‚Äôt even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I‚Äôm getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn‚Äôt the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn‚Äôt on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn‚Äôt do you any good to have access to all these games if you can‚Äôt see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your Atalantanet can handle it, anyway. But don‚Äôt worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I‚Äôve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn‚Äôt have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what‚Äôs the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything‚Äôs buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don‚Äôt have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn‚Äôt have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn‚Äôt be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I‚Äôve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.
