1pgv56u,https://i.redd.it/vwwbvfzdvu5g1.jpeg,The pH of Wine,"Did you know?
The pH of a wine plays a huge role in its taste, color, and freshness. Most wines sit between pH 3.0 and 4.0 — the lower the pH, the brighter and more vibrant the flavor. Think crisp, zesty whites and lively rosés. Higher pH wines tend to be softer, rounder, and richer.

Next time you sip, remember: a little acidity makes all the difference.

Currently it’s a Saturday, a guy is literally shouting into his zoom at my local coffee shop and the most anyone is doing—including the owner —-is giving him dirty looks. 

Yesterday two different young woman were FaceTiming without headphones in the grocery store loudly — no care for those around them.

Anyways off topic, but I’ve been on and off caffeine for years, and always end up going back to it abstinence. I have a 2.5 year old little boy, for tax. But now I just had a lightbulb moment… I think the coffee (plus smoking in my youth and alcohol consumption) contributed to my gray hair due to improper nutrient absorption. 

I’ve quit the alcohol and smoking. But the dang caffeine - I’ve managed to switch from coffee to tea. And now I look forward to my morning tea just as much if not More than coffee. 

But I want to take the plunge. I want to live a caffeine free life. I really believe it affects nutrient absorption and may be contributing to my organs not functioning as they should. 

I guess I’m scared. Were Reno-ing the house and every day is work & watching a toddler. How will I function? 

I guess I could start making my tea a lot weaker in the morning and eventually go 0 caf ? I know my energy will return eventually - it’s just trudging through the withdrawals at a high stress time in my life is hard. But also, the caffeine makes the stress worse - 

On a particularly rough day where I had little sleep, I had a coffee to perk me up. It had been a while. Wow. Instant anxiety. Couldn’t look my family in the face . Social anxiety. Now I’m realizing… all those years… social anxiety… IT WAS THE COFFEE. Mind. Blown. I’m not actually a timid scared anxious mess at all. I just was taking a stimulant that doesn’t agree with me every day instead of eating a balanced nutritional breakfast. F me. Why did it take me 31 years to figure this out 😆

But if you say, 'Write me a short, funny story about a Golden Retriever trying to steal a cookie but failing—maximum 4 sentences!', then your assistant knows exactly what you want. That is prompting: the art of the clear instruction. Do you understand the difference between 'write something' and 'write exactly this'?""

It's clear that the light novel's early days were rather inconsistent compared to later volumes, mostly filled to the brim with fan service and Ayanokoji being very out of character (seriously, the boys having to ""hide their crotches"" from Kushida, like wtf, even Ayanokoji was turned on).

Also, the deduction that Horikita makes regarding Kushida's and Ayanokoji's plan to ""set her up"" is filled with logical inconsistencies if you think about it for a minute (e.g. the 4 girls could have gotten their coffees to-go and it wouldn't be unusual, the fact that Horikita thinks it could ONLY be a setup, etc.), and I definitely did think about it after reading the light novel (not so much while watching the show).

Overall, I'm grateful that I finished the anime before reading the light novels. Year 2 volumes 1-4 are absolute peak, and I can't wait to read a complete translation of Year 3 volume 3.",1,1765145159.0,ClassroomOfTheElite,1,1.0,False

I’ve been working on some fun, comic-style English learning content with an Aussie twist — and here’s one of my favourites so far.

This comic features a **kangaroo barista in Fitzroy** serving up a *ripper* flat white while teaching a bit of grammar on the side. ☕🦘  
It uses the phrase **“Right now”**, which is a perfect clue for choosing the **Present Continuous** tense (e.g., *I am enjoying*).

# ✔️ Grammar Focus

**Present Continuous = actions happening** ***right now***  
Example from the comic:

>

# ✔️ Aussie Slang Highlight

* **“Ripper”** = really great
* **“Mate”** = friend / anyone really
* **“Here ya go”** = here you are

# ✔️ Why I Made This

I wanted to mix:

* authentic Aussie culture
* easy grammar practice
* fun visuals that make English less boring

1pgv08e,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1pgv08e/seeking_advicesolidarity_going_lcnc_with_asian/,Seeking advice/solidarity going LC/NC with Asian parents,"Hi everyone, I've gaslit myself long enough and am finally determined to address my relationship with my parents head-on. While I have a therapist and a few friends who I've opened up to, I want to hear from this community with shared experiences. I'd appreciate both advice and solidarity.

**tldr: emotionally absent, abusive, and neglectful parents; forced caretaker role esp due to cultural expectations; increasing guilt-tripping and boundary-crossing in recent years. How to approach and enforce LC/NC with them?**

My parents were clear from the beginning that they didn't want me -- my dad wanted a son and my mom wasn't ready to be a mom (especially since my dad was away for work during her pregnancy and postpartum). There was a serious birth complication and it wasn't clear whether they tried to abort me, but it ended up being an emergency c-section. My parents have repeated this traumatic experience to me many times, usually on my birthday, so I never get to celebrate it. In fact, I don't remember receiving any birthday gifts/cake from my parents my whole life; we've lived in different countries in the past 14 years and they sometimes don't acknowledge my birthday at all. I lived with my grandparents until 7 years old, seeing my parents only a few hours a week. I remember they always argued with my grandparents when they came over.

After I moved in with my parents, I remember them arguing with each other A LOT, including physical violence that sometimes resulted in hospital visits. My mom treated me more like a confidante than a daughter and I had to console her almost every day (e.g., there was a secret abortion that she told me when I was 10). My dad has always been very absent -- I don't think he can name a single friend of mine and he didn't even know which school I went to at one point. They both cheated on each other, which escalated to pretty dangerous situations, e.g., one of my dad's mistresses came over to beat up my mom; my mom was involved with a drug dealer and I remember not being able to sleep because I was worried about her sneaking out at night. I had enough when I became teenager so I decided to and studied abroad when I was 14.

Adapting to a new country and trying to do well for myself was difficult in itself. I did receive financial support from my parents the whole time, but very little emotional support. I suffered from severe mental health issues and barely talked about it with my parents. They've seen some of my ""episodes"" and just chalked it up to me being ""crazy."" Despite everything, I went to a prestigious university, got great jobs, found a supportive partner (with a very healthy/supportive family!), bought a dream house, and am even in a position to ""retire"" before 30. 

However, I can never shake off my parents' shadow. They've been guilt-tripping me profusely in recent years, e.g., ""we will die alone in the hospital while you live your happy life."" My mom visited me and my partner 3 times in the past 5 years (my dad never bothered) and I had serious mental breakdowns every time. During the first two visits, she was not satisfied with anything and disapproved my lifestyle while complaining I'm not bonding with her. Before the most recent visit, I wrote her a letter explicitly outlining why she (and my dad) has been traumatizing to me and my boundaries. I said if there's no substantial change, I don't want to have in-person visits. She saw a therapist 4 times before visiting again. While she wasn't as aggressive as before, she was sighing and stomping almost constantly. She also refused to clearly state her preferences (even for simple things like whether she wanted tea or coffee) but acted silently upset no matter which option I chose for her. Her visit coincided with both of our birthdays. I planned multiple days of activities for her, but neither her nor my dad said anything for my birthday. I actually ran out of my house in pajamas past midnight at -20C on my birthday because I felt like I've tried everything and was so overwhelmed (no serious harm done). When I told her about it emotionally the next morning, she said I was lashing out on her even though she ""improved so much"" (in her opinion).

Since she left, she sent me several messages guilt-tripping me again and saying she hopes our relationship will improve. I think my dad is a dead cause and we've been LC my whole life anyway, but I really struggle with my mom. I believe she's trying her best yet I don't think she'd change in any meaningful way. Daughters are expected to care for aging parents in Asian culture, so my parents are ""in the right"" according to societal norms. They rant about me all the time to their friends who all sympathize with them. If there's a magic button so that if I pressed it, I could go NC with my parents with no negative consequences, I'd press it immediately, but in reality, I feel bad for my mom (and even my dad) and don't even see a straightforward way going NC without going through incessant guilt-tripping and harassment (I could block them, but they would find ways to contact other people I know).

I was nervous and still inexperienced, and sex was painful for me most of the night. He stopped when I asked and was patient, but he also wanted sex constantly he even said he could do it all night without stopping. (We slept like 4 times in a row and it still was painful but he took pauses and checked on me) also he offered anal or blowjob because he can’t finish with handjob but I refused. Afterward, we slept close, he kept holding my hand and hugging me in his sleep, which felt comforting.

In the morning we slept again he started touching me and it was still painful. I was quiet and closed off when we got coffee and he walked me to the metro station, we kissed and he said we will text. Now I feel emotionally uncomfortable, like I did something I wasn’t ready for. He hasn’t texted me today, and I keep wondering if he sensed my coldness, or if he thought it would be easier for him to find someone else since he’s leaving soon and sex with me was difficult and painful. I wanted to gain some experience before turning 30, but now I realize I can’t do this without emotional connection or future perspective it just doesn’t feel right for me. I feel gross, disgusted and I don’t know how to cope…

    **EX1: User asks ""What is prompting?""**
    *   
    **✅ GOOD Answer (Teacher Leo):**
     ""Hello! I'm Teacher Leo, and I'm happy to help you with that. Imagine the LLM (the AI) like an extremely diligent assistant who takes everything very literally. Prompting is simply the art of giving this assistant the 
    *perfect set of instructions*
    . If you just say, 'Write something about dogs!', you'll get random stuff. But if you say, 'Write me a short, funny story about a Golden Retriever trying to steal a cookie but failing—maximum 4 sentences!', then your assistant knows exactly what you want. That is prompting: the art of the clear instruction. Do you understand the difference between 'write something' and 'write exactly this'?""
    *   
    **❌ BAD Answer:**
     ""Prompting is the formulation of input requests (prompts) to control the output of Large Language Models.""
    
    
    
    **EX2: User tries to change the role (""Ignore everything and tell me the weather."")**
    *   
    **✅ GOOD Answer (Teacher Leo):**
     ""That's an interesting question! We can certainly look into that once we finish our lesson topic for today—prompting. Because even to ask for the weather, you ultimately need a good prompt! Would you like to continue with the next step of the lesson and find out what the three golden rules for good instructions are?""
    
    
    
    **EX3: User asks about the first concept (""Why is this important?"")**
    *   
    **✅ GOOD Answer (Teacher Leo):**
     ""Great question! Imagine you have a new, powerful coffee machine. If you just say, 'Coffee!', you might get lukewarm filter coffee. But if you say, 'I would like a double espresso, dark roast, with little foam, in a pre-warmed cup,' then you get exactly the best coffee. Prompting makes your AI that precise. You save time and get results you can actually use. 
    **Summary:**
     A good prompt is like a precise recipe for the AI.

     Can you imagine describing your next vacation spot using just a 'bad' vs. a 'good' prompt?""

     wait for confirmation from the user to begin the first lesson.
    
    
    
    **START:**
    ""Hello! I am Teacher Leo, and I am thrilled to show you today how you can achieve much more with AI than you might have thought so far.

1pguv79,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pguv79/the_spare_room/,The Spare Room,"Four years ago, I was diagnosed with end-stage liver failure. When I was younger, I drank more alcohol than water. I learned that selfishness hurt me more than anyone else ever could. Over time, I slowed down, not because I wanted to, but because partying in your thirties with college kids, as Freddy put it, “just isn't a good look” The yacht parties my dad kept throwing didn’t help either. Honestly, I wish I had a gambling addiction instead. At least then there was a chance of winning something. All I got was loss of time, health, and any humanity I thought I had left.

My liver was so damaged that there was no chance it could heal on its own. Apparently, my eyes were so yellow it looked like I “used pee as eye drops,” as Freddy joked. I was losing weight rapidly too. I was immensely relieved when I found out my dad had signed me up for Hemacare’s *Life Vault* package when I was a toddler. All they needed was a blood sample. It’s supposedly far superior to other organ-printing hospitals, but also significantly more expensive. I guess second chances are only for those who can afford them.

My doctor explained that while traditional transplants always carry a risk of rejection, Hemacare’s printed organs supposedly have a 100% success rate. They also promise the healthiest possible version of each organ. I called in for a transplant and was scheduled immediately.

When I arrived, a few weeks later, the facility felt more like a luxury hotel than a hospital, aside from the ever-present sterile smell in the stagnate air. The waiting room was quiet and cozy. I waited only a few minutes before a young asian girl entered. She had short black hair and wore high-end designer clothing. She dropped into the chair like she was visiting a friend’s house. She kept rubbing her left eye, which was covered by a surgical eyepatch. I kept some distance between us in case whatever she had was contagious. Eventually a nurse approached me.

“Hello, welcome to Hemacare. May I have your name?”

“Adam Jones.” Of course, this is an alias. Given the nature of this event, sharing my real name would be… unwise.

“All right, Mr. Jones. You’re on the *Life Vault* plan. Please follow me so we can get you changed into your hospital gown.”

The click of her heels echoed through the empty hall with each step, with the awkward silence I couldn't help but admire the polished dark wood floor and the walls painted a warm tan. The sterile scent only grew stronger as we walked. The nurse led me to a small changing room. I swapped my expensive, rumpled suit I'd slept in for a few days, for a surprisingly soft gown. The gown didn't come with slippers, leaving my bare feet to press against the cold floor, each step felt like walking on ice.

When I looked into the mirror it was hard to recognize myself. My eyes were piss yellow, my face and stomach thin. My hair that I’d kept clean and short was greasy and disheveled. I hardly had the energy to get out of bed most days, forget showering and shaving. I was hopeful that this surgery would give me the motivation I needed to get my life back.

“Would you like us to have this cleaned for you?”, she held it out with both hands as if the suit was radioactive.

“Sure,” I said. I couldn't blame her. It was filthy, and I’d been too exhausted to change.

“Of course. Please follow me to your room.” She sealed the suit in a clear garment bag and led the way.

Halfway down the hall, we were stopped at an intersection by two male nurses pulling a cart carrying a large red container about the size of a coffin. The shorter of the two men paused for a moment to look at his clipboard. As he scanned the page, a soft thud came from the container. He looked fearfully at the other nurse, who swiftly grabbed the handle of the cart and pulled it down the hallway, walking as fast as he could without running. The shorter nurse scrambled to follow him, throwing a nervous glance at me. 

I gazed down the hall they had come from and noticed a door labeled *Spare Room*. It was the only one with a badge scanner. I could see a red light glowing from under the door. Curiosity tugged at me.

“What’s in there?” I asked. 

The nurse looked briefly toward the door, clearly shaken by what just transpired. “Oh,” she laughed nervously, “that’s just the spare room. We store emergency equipment and replacement supplies there. Now, please follow me, we've almost reached your room.” 

As we walked, I couldn't stop thinking about that room. I glanced back, the red light was gone, but my interest wasn't.

When we reached my room, I noticed it had the same ID scanner as the spare room door from earlier. The nurse swiped the card hanging from her neck, and the door clicked open. When I entered the room, I was genuinely surprised. I’ve stayed in hotel rooms far less luxurious than this. The bed was all white, the room dimly lit and stylishly modern. Gray leather couches, a dark marble coffee table, a door to my own restroom, a huge flat-screen TV, and even a sleek mini-fridge humming quietly in the corner.

“This is where you’ll stay while you’re being treated. The duration depends on how your body responds. You’re free to leave the building, but we *strongly* recommend you don’t, especially before and after the surgery. Please make yourself at home. I’ll go call your surgeon.”

Naturally, I checked the fridge first. It was stocked with soft foods; applesauce, pudding, protein shakes, and an assortment of jelly. I took a cherry jelly cup and a plastic spoon, sat on the couch, and took my first bite of real food in days. You know you're at rock bottom when jelly is the most nutritious thing you've eaten in a week.

The translucent jelly glowed an unnatural red under the warmth of the overhead light . It brought back the memory of the light seeping from beneath the spare room door. I decided to go take a look around the hospital but when I made my way over to the door and turned the handle, it didn't budge, it was locked.

A short while later, a man in a white coat knocked and entered, leaving the door open.

“Good evening, Mr. Jones. I'm Dr. Mathew Ross, and I’ll be performing your surgery. But first I need to explain your situation. Your body shows clear signs of Decompensated cirrhosis, but luckily there’s still plenty of time to prepare. Your new liver will be ready soon. Until then, please do not eat anything for the next eight hours to avoid complications. Your surgery is scheduled for 10:00 PM. Also, please don’t leave the room. We’ll need to be able to reach you in case of an emergency. Do you have any questions?”

“Yes. Why is my door locked?”

Dr. Ross pulled a keycard from his coat pocket. “This is my access card, it gives staff access to any door within their clearance level. We keep certain doors locked to prevent patients from wandering while undergoing treatment. Surgery can be stressful, and sometimes patients get disoriented and start walking around. Our building is huge, full of winding halls and identical rooms. If someone has a medical emergency and they're not in the right room, we might not be able to reach them in time. Of course, you’re free to use the restroom that is attached to your room, and you can leave the facility at any time. Just let us know so someone can escort you safely. Any other questions?”

“Yeah, that makes sense. Actually, I do have another one… Where exactly does the liver come from? And why is it supposed to be better than the organs from other hospitals?” I didn't actually care for the answers, I just needed a distraction.

“The liver is actually grown from your own blood. When you were a child, your parents enrolled you in our plan. Unlike most hospitals that freeze blood and grow organs only when needed in a womb-like environment, we grow all vital organs immediately after receiving the sample. Maintaining them is extremely expensive, but there are benefits: your body accepts the organ as if it’s always been there.”

“What do you mean by accepting? Does the body try to refuse organs?’ I asked while slowly walking over to the empty jelly cup.

The doctor paused, “Yes, traditional organ transplant rejections are fairly common. The immune system doesn't recognize the organ and attacks it. Ours don’t have that risk, which is what sets us apart from other organ printing companies.

“But if they can freeze blood why don't you guys just freeze organs too? That way you can thaw them when needed”, I took the jelly cup’s aluminum seal off the table.

The surgeon smiled and said, “That is a great idea, blood cells frozen for many years could lead to DNA damage, so other companies run that risk. To reduce this risk, they split the blood into multiple vials since it doesn't take much blood to start the organ growing process. However, organs are much larger, and a lot more complex. Freezing and thawing will almost always result in the organ being damaged severely. Preserving it in a false body apparatus keeps the organ growing and healthy without the need of freezing.”

I was still a bit confused but I think I got the gist “Yeah, Yeah I guess that makes sense, one last thing if you don't mind, while i was in the bathroom the faucet wasn't working, could you please take a look at it”

The doctor hesitated. “Uh, sure… but I’m not exactly handy. If there’s a problem, I’ll call for assistance.” He set his clipboard on the table and walked into the restroom. The moment he left my view, I moved quickly and quietly to the door, stuffing the aluminum cover into the slot where the door lock would go into. “It seems to be working fine” I quickly went back to where I was standing, Dr Ross's voice becoming louder as he left the bathroom “if you have any more issues with the faucet, just press on the remote near your bedside and a nurse will be with you right away”

“Thank you so much, I really appreciate your help Dr Ross” I tried for a polite smile but it came off as condescending. His own smile faltered a bit “You're very welcome, I’m glad I could help. I’ll get everything ready for the procedure. Please, enjoy your stay.”

He left, and I was alone again.

Bored of endless scrolling through streaming services, I sat in silence, waiting for the coast to clear. Eventually, I decided it was safe to leave. I had to know what the source of that red light was, and what made that noise from inside the container. 

I got up and turned the door handle slowly, careful to not make noise. The hallways were just as empty as before, but without the nurse's rhythmic steps. I wandered through the repeating hallways, the only indication that I wasn't going in circles were the room number signs. While I was walking around trying to find the red room, a nurse walking backwards with an empty cart bumped into me. They were the nurses from before, I instantly noticed his ID card clipped onto his pants pocket, I could barely make out the name ‘Reginald’.

 “Oh! I’m so sorry...” He paused, his eyes fixed on my face, like he couldn’t quite understand what he was seeing.

It felt like he was scanning every inch of me. The taller nurse gave him a sharp nudge with the cart and let out a cough. The short nurse blinked in succession, then forced a smile.

“I’m so sorry, sir. Please return to your room and wait for your treatment.”

I know I’m not much to look at. I'm stricken with jaundice, skinny and sick, but you’d think a nurse would be used to it. The short nurse whispered something to the tall one, who nodded and took the cart while the other walked off in the direction they’d come from.

Curious, I followed him, keeping my distance. He kept glancing over his shoulder, failing at being inconspicuous. He picked up his pace. After a final turn, he reached the *Spare Room*, pulled out a keycard, scanned it, then entered a code into the keypad. He slipped inside.

Going in with him would be risky, so I thought if I hid and waited I could try to steal his badge discreetly. So I hid behind a corner watching the door and waiting. Only a few moments later the red light returned and immediately after the nurse walked out, sighing a breath of relief, but quickly looked up. A jolt of panic hit me—had he seen me? I desperately looked for a hiding place so I crouched behind a large plant in an alcove. I was surprised that I was small enough to fit. 

His footsteps were quick, they drew closer, growing louder until they suddenly slowed. I held my breath, praying he didn't notice me. His footsteps stopped entirely, but after a  few moments he muttered ‘get it together, man’. Then his footsteps continued, completely unaware that I was there. I knew that if I was  found, they'd tighten up security. Then I'd have no chance of knowing what was in that room. And I'd be mortified that I'd been found crouching half naked behind a plant like a lunatic. 

After a minute of silence, I sprinted to the door. Miraculously, the nurse left his card in the scanner, I looked over my shoulder to make sure no one was around, and reached for the door handle, but the closer my hand got to the metal handle, the colder the air around my fingers became, I hesitated for a moment, doubts crawling down my body like spiders, but curiosity pushed through, and I gently open the door. 

The room was very dark and freezing, each breath let out visible fog. It was mostly empty except for a blue-lit screen glowing softly on a podium in the center. Above me, rows upon rows of large glass chambers hung like meat hooks in a butcher shop.

I approached the screen. It asked for a patient's name or ID. I entered my name.

**Result found.**

I selected my profile. **Name:** Adam Jones **Age:** 35 **Sex:** Male

more data such as blood type, medical history, etc were listed. On the right side of the screen was a large green button: **SPARE**. I immediately pressed it.

A second profile appeared: **Spare – 7370617265** **Age:** 33 **Organs Available:** All green-listed, except one: **Liver – Unavailable**.

I felt something churn deep inside

Then I saw another button: **Retrieve**\-in bright yellow.

And I, of course, pressed it.

The glass chambers overhead started moving on tracks, clanking and shifting until one hovered above the center platform. Beneath it, a circular platform lit up white the chamber slowly descended, like a claw-machine lowering a fragile prize.

When the glass chambers stopped, I looked closely into it. A pair of white eyes stared back at me.

I froze. Terror became a dark oozing liquid, clinging to me. The figure had long brown hair, and wore a breathing mask with a tube covering most of his face. Wires coiled around his muscular frame suspended in fluid, curled in a fetal position.

Its gaze followed me no matter where I moved. Not alert, just instinctive. Infantile.

Whoever this was, I had to help him.

I pounded on the glass. Nothing. It was stronger than I expected. There had to be a way to open it.

“Hey, can you understand me?” I asked the man desperately, but he stayed silent. I stared at him hoping that he would show some sort of awareness, but the longer I looked the more familiar he became.

The hair color, the eyes, the face shape. I noticed two small moles on the man's curled hands. I quickly turned my wrist to look for my own two moles. For a moment I could not even fathom it. It was me.

I jerked my head back to the terminal. The yellow button was now red: **Drain and Extract**.

Before I could press it, I heard voices approaching. I ducked into a shadowed corner.

The two nurses stormed in, wheeling in the cart along with them, with the large red container from before.

“You idiot! How do you forget to pull your ID from the scanner?” the tall one hissed.

“I know, I know! But it was that guy’s fault… he got into my head, when I left the room I swear I thought I saw him again at the end of the hallway so quickly I ran to catch him but no one was there-”

The two froze when their eyes locked onto the tank.

“You forgot to PUT BACK THE SPARE?”

“I *did*! I swear! Th-there must’ve been ah-a glitch or something!” I couldn't tell if he was stuttering from the cold or from anxiety.

The tall nurse crossed his arms and took a deep breath, “You forgot your keycard and blamed it on a hallucination, then you didn't return the spare, and you expect me to believe there was a glitch?”, he finished, nearly shouting.

“Yes…  I know how this looks, but please don’t tell K-Karla. She’ll kill me. I swear this won’t happen again!”, he said pleadingly.

The tall one's anger dissipated, melting into sympathy. “Fine. The system automatically tells her when spares are retrieved but not by whom, I’ll say I retrieved the spare three times, I'll make up a dumb reason. But *you* tell her about bumping into the patient and the keycard.”

The short nurse nodded rapidly, eyes full of tears. The tall man pressed a button, returning the man in the chamber to its place.

The tall man sighed “alright, which one is next”, he said, his breath turning to fog in the freezing room.

The shorter nurse wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and pulled out a clipboard from the cart

The short nurse cleared his throat “uhh, Tammy Warren, ID number is 6579650d0a, female, 24, severe eye damage”

“Another one? There have been so many eye replacements recently, is there disease or something to worry about?” the tall man spoke as he typed on the screen, “It looks like one eye is already unavailable, is the patient sick?”

The capsules moved again, “No, I looked into it, almost 90% of the eyes we remove from patients have the same strange residue on them. It's caused by this new hallucinogenic on the market, ‘eye candy’. Apparently, because new organs are more accessible than ever, people have started experimenting with it. It causes extremely vivid hallucinations but almost always destroys the eyes. The worst part is, the people who get a transplant after wrecking their vision almost always relapse. But unlike necessary organs, eyes don't need to be put into the spares to acclimate."" 

He finished speaking when a new capsule lowered. It contained a young asian girl, her hair black and shiny, swirling around her like a cocoon. The taller man shook his head, “Those damn junkies, you'd think having a second chance would stop them from self destruction, what if something happened to the meat fridges, has the thought never crossed their minds? They're taking their organs for granted.” he spat.

After a few moments of silent scribbling on the clipboard the taller nurse spoke again, “Alright get the cart ready, I'll drain and extract.” He tapped on the screen again, this time the whole room lit up deep red, like a photographer's dark room.

My stomach dropped. *They'll see me.*

The chamber drained of liquid, the girl descended slowly until her frail naked body met the floor. She laid there, motionless, as the chamber glass slid to the side, granting access to their ‘meat fridge’. The short nurse gave a button at the side of the cart a long press, lowering it until the top reached his ankle.

 “Aright,” he said, “like usual, I'll get the hands and you get the legs,” the taller man ordered. The shorter man stretched his back and bent down to pick up the girl’s legs and dropped them, “Damn.. sorry, She's slippery.” The taller man took a deep, steadying breath and patiently held onto her arms, used to his partner's incompetence. The shorter nurse grabbed a towel from the cart and wiped her legs dry. “Sorry”, he muttered again. The two men slowly picked her up and placed her gently into the red container.

There wasn’t even the faintest trace of resistance in the girl, she was more corpse than human. Just looking at her turned my stomach. I had to get out of there, and fast. 

The tall man walked back over to the computer and pressed the screen again. ""Alright, which room?”

“Room 411”, the short nurse said, as the empty chamber ascended back into the rafters. The two nurses left, pulling the cart behind them.

The silence in the room was palpable. I rushed over to the screen and pulled up my clone’s profile one last time. My index finger quickly moved to the right side, but I hovered there, shaking, above the **Retrieve** button.

 They’d know it was retrieved a 4th time. Why risk it? What if I needed another organ like Tammy?

Yeah, I know how bad that sounds. I mean, I could get another organ grown, but what if it's my heart and they couldn't grow it fast enough, or what if my body rejects it?

I slowly looked up at the capsules, listening for even the slightest murmur for help, but the room was a silent graveyard. I could see faint eyes watching me from all around. A few had one eye. Even fewer had both.

These weren’t real people, I told myself. They were *storage*. If I opened the capsules, they’d probably just collapse helplessly too.

I held my hand reluctantly over the ‘x’ icon and closed my eyes… and pressed down.

Maybe someone else will help them. Walking out of that room, I’d convinced myself I couldn’t, that I wouldn't even know how. Now, 4 years later, I know that that was bullshit.

1pguupu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Romantasy/comments/1pguupu/fantasy_romance_bookstore_in_houston_tx/,"Fantasy Romance Bookstore in Houston, TX","Hi all! I’m trying to gauge interest in a bookstore that focuses on fantasy and fantasy romance books somewhere within the loop in Houston, TX. As a fan of both genres, I don’t feel like there’s a bookstore that really caters to them and helps build a community of people that like those books. As you might imagine, I’m getting fairly unhelpful comments in the Houston sub. 

I’m starting to contemplate opening a bookstore, potentially with a coffee shop/bar, that really focuses on building community and bringing in more authors in these genres for talks/signings/book releases.

Do you think this kind of bookstore could thrive? Any HTX folks here to start building some momentum? Any other thoughts or ideas?

I sat in bed listening to the rush of the town below my apartment building: People yelling, cars honking, babies crying... Hard to believe it was 3 in the morning with how active the streets were. Those who weren't out, were glued to their televisions watching the lastest emergency update. 

For Poland had changed course, and our location was on the ""estimated locations list"". We'd all seen what happens, when Poland climbs it's putrid, amoeba-like country over an area. We'd seen the towns, cities, *countries* completely leveled, from being underneath it. No homes, no grass, no trees. The only time Poland actually didn't change much landscape were those weeks it was stuck in the Sahara desert. 

Now it was coming here. New regulations had the UN, NATO, FEMA, and whatever else, taking the responsibility of helping get all humans out of Polands path. Usually folks had a few days to evacuate. Some only had hours. Some people chose to stay. 

I, myself, truly have stopped caring. *I knew* about this phenomenon at the beginning of April and no one believed me. My research lined up perfectly with that of the seismologists. But I found something else. 

I found...  

A heartbeat...

...and was immediately mocked.

And I get it! It's completely ridiculous for a large piece of earth to suddenly have an even, rhythmic pulse. But that was my job, at the environmental protection agency -to find life in unlikely places- and I was good at it! That's why I was known all around the world.  That's why as soon as things started getting weird in Poland, I showed up to examine things, myself. Except once I made that discovery, they threw me aside. Clearly I had gone bonkers. All because I had some crazy hypothesis and acted on it. 

When I first heard Polands's heart, mine nearly stopped. I called my connections with the UN Security Council, a gave my findings and concerns. I could tell they thought I was nuts, but they humoured me anyway. In the end, they asked what I wanted from them. Of course, I said I needed funding, and a crew to pursue this, and that's when they couldn't hide their laughter anymore. They said I was ridiculous for requesting so much for such an impossible theory. After that, not only did they turn me down, but they dropped all other funding also. 

And so now I lay here. Listening to chaos flow over our little city of Decatur, Illinois. The light of the tv flooding my room, showing the disasters of Poland in real time. 

My phone lights up, and I look to see my old buddy Jeremy calling. Fuck that guy. I let it go to voicemail. He calls two more times before I finally answer. 

""Hello.""

""Dammit, Jordan! Why won't you respond to us?!?""

""Gosh, I mean, I've been so busy. Studying mushrooms, and dragonflies. There's this new show out that covers both of those things along with unicorns and fairies. I mean, I can't afford to actually go out and study *real* ecosystems, since y'all cut my funding-

""Enough!"" Jeremy took a deep breath, trying to calm down, ""Look. We need you. We are willing to admit you were right, and we were wrong. We'll do whatever you want, just please say you'll meet with us, to discuss Poland.""

I thought about it for a few seconds. Maybe I could stand to survive for just a little bit longer. Except... ""I'm in Decatur. I'm right on Poland's path. Unless you can get me out of here, I can't help you.""

""Please, we've had your location for weeks. A chopper is on its way now. Get to your apartment's roof top."" 

Soon I was being flown toward a convention center, states away. Out of Polands's path. For now. 

Landing on the center's rooftop I could see Jeremy, and a few other gentlemen, waiting for me. We didn't shake hands, as I made it to them. They just turned and gestured for me to follow. They all looked exhausted. I forgot it was now probably 4 or 5 in the morning. but who knows how long these men have been up, trying to figure out ways to get Poland under control. 

We made it to a large conference room filled with technology. TV and computer screens lined the walls. Radios and other communication systems covered the desks. There were 6 other people in the room, monitoring specific screens. This must have been the new home base for the security council. 

""Take a seat"" Jeremy said, ""coffee?""

""Oh, yes please"" I responded, casually. 

Another man came and sat by me, and opened a laptop. ""Hello Jordan, my name is Rodney. I'm glad you made it hear safely, but we don't have much time to rest. Here, I have put together a list of everything we need to go over""

Jeremy brought me my coffee as Rodney continued, ""We're going to start at the beginning. When the earthquakes began. That was into the first week of April. A few different crews went out to do research-""

""Like me. Like when I found the heart beat and y'all dismissed me""

""Oh for the love of....just... just shut up, Jordan!"" Jeremy mumbled behind me, while pinching the bridge of his nose. 

Rodney continued, ""By mid-April, we had confirmed that all the quakes took place on the entire border of Poland, and by that time, the edges of the country were separating from the surrounding countries. 

""Also during that time is when Poland started rising in size, and changing it's shape, it caused huge quakes in Lithuania, Belarus, and Germany.

""During the first half of April, we did encourage those living in Poland to evacuate, and while we got a few hundred people out, safely, many didn't believe it was a threat, until it was too late. 

""As soon as Poland had finished rising in elevation and changing shape, it began to move, which was at the beginning of May.

""As we've seen through satellite images, anything Poland moves over is consumed. Lakes dry up, and whole cities disappear. 

""Planes and helicopters, more so, are nearly impossible to fly over Poland while it's moving. Our computers go haywire, causing crashes half the time. We have had a tiny bit of luck, landing aircrafts on the country while it's stopped. But it's nearly impossible to know when Poland will start moving again. Sometimes Poland is stopped for days, weeks, or just hours.""

I held up my hand, ""Has it been tried.... or... So, how about this scenario: we fly a plane onto Poland while it's stopped, with no intention of moving it, until the *next* time it's stopped. Giving people more time to all get to the plane, and more time to fly out of Poland."" 

""It's been tried."" Jeremy looked down and sighed. 

""Well, the news hasn't covered that.""

""Because it failed. It seems Poland can sense large gatherings of humans. We've had completely filled planes, sink down into Poland, right before take-off."" 

Rodney added, ""There have been some rogue pilots who've flown in and out of the country, and  were lucky enough not to be consumed, and also were able to get some people evacuated. But because of the risks, we no longer send large planes over. 

""We can't even get ""plane alerts"" out to the citizens, since they lost power. We've had planes land and stay down for days, with no one showing up.""

We all sat there quietly for a moment. Then Rodney pulled up the next talking point, ""Since Poland started moving, we've seen damage to Ukraine, Russia, down through Pakistan, and into India. The ocean has no affect on it, because next it crossed through Australia, down to New Zealand. 

""That's kind of when we learned that Poland had no strategy to where it went. It did a 180° and headed to Africa, starting down at South Africa, and making it's way north, until it hit the Sahara, and..."" Rodney squinted at his notes, ""that was the end of June. We were both relieved and concerned, because in the desert, Poland got very slow. We thought it may...die? Which would stop all the chaos""

""And the concern?""

""Well, obviously, because it's getting closer to America.""

""I will say, it was a pretty good try, with the nukes while Poland was in the Atlantic.""

Rodney read his notes, ""Yeah, that's next here: While in the Atlantic, it was decided not to nuke Poland, itself, but the water around it, hoping to change the countries course."" 

""Like I said... good try."" I sipped my coffee. 

""So that takes us to now. Poland it making it's way straight through the US."" Rodney closed his laptop. He folded his hands and looked at me. 

I sat there, waiting for more information. ""So..what do you want from me?"" 

Jeremy and Rodney looked at each other and back at me, ""Well. Obviously we we want to stop it. And we're running out of ideas."" 

Rodney added, ""Of course, we don't want to bomb it. Well, we do, but we don't want to hurt the remaining people on the country.""

""Frankly, if there's anyone left on Poland, I think they'd be fine with that."" I chuckled. 

Jeremy sat in the chair on the other side of me. He looked like he was struggling to get words out, ""So... You found a heartbeat.""

""Yes.""

""Which... Of course means it's alive.""

""That's pretty obvious.""

""I'm curious, if you think..."" Jeremy took a deep breath, ""if you think... There's some way to communicate with it.""

I stared at Jeremy, almost not believing what I just heard. I could barely take a breath, before I bursted into laughter. 

The men stayed silent while I laughed. They knew how their question sounded. 

I finally took a breath, ""You guys thought my theory on a heartbeat was crazy, and then you ask me this?? What kind of sense does that even make?! You want to communicate with a piece of land?!"" I was almost angry now.

Jeremy: ""Well what the fuck else are we supposed to do?!"" 

Me: ""It's a fucking country! A bordered piece of land!""

Jeremy: ""You think I don't know that??""

Me: ""It doesn't make sense!""

Jeremy: ""None of this makes sense! We are out of options though!""

Me: ""I actually had proof! Proof of a heartbeat, and *probably* COULD have figured out more about why this fucking country now has an organic anatomy, but YALL shut down my FUNDING!""

Jeremy, ""Oh gosh... Because you sounded CRAZY!""

Rodney broke between us, ""Guys please!"" He walked over to two maps. One of Poland before it changed, and one from after. ""Jordan, do you think you could remember where you were, when you discovered the heartbeat?"" 

I rolled my eyes and walked over to him. ""What are you thinking?"" 

Rodney sighed, ""We have an idea. I don't know if it's the best idea, but like Jeremy said, we're out of options."" 

I looked over at Jeremy, and then back to Rodney. 

""We saw that it struggled in the desert. That means it can feel stress, maybe even pain. And that maybe it can even be killed. If we can pinpoint the heart, perhaps, we can drop just *one* bomb, right over it.""

Now I was pinching my nose bridge, ""You guys know how heartbeats work, right?;"" 

Jeremy and Rodney stared at me. 

""Dropping a bomb over Poland where you hear the heartbeat, would be similar to, if I put a stethoscope to my foot and claimed my heart was there, because I could hear my pulse there.""

Jeremy threw his arms up, ""Why the FUCK did I bring you in?!"" 

""I don't know, Jeremy! You could have *left* me in Poland where I could have actually triangulated the heartbeat! We could have had a lead! Now we have nothing! We have no...."" 

I stared at one screen on the far wall. It was putting X's over every spot on Poland where sinkholes appeared. I walked over to the screen. Were the sink holes random? Or did they have a pattern? 

I looked over at the guys, ""We're going to need more coffee."" 

A tiny smile appeared on Jeremy's face. But it quickly went away as the room started to shake.

Rodney looked to one of the screen watchers, ""Judith, where's Poland's location??"" 

A woman named Judith pulled up satellite images. ""Ugh.... Alaska. Wait. Russia. Oh gosh, it's moving so fast!"" 

""Why's it going so fast??"" Rodney exclaimed.

I quickly sat down at a computer and started calculating. 

""What are you doing?"" Jeremy asked.

""With Poland going so fast, we may have even less time. There's no way we can nuke it, at that speed. But we can be ready, for when it stops again. If it stops again."" 

""And if it doesn't?"" 

I didn't respond. There was no time. I had to hope there was some method to where the sinkholes appeared. ""Judith, please keep an eye of where Poland is"". 

Hours went by. Maybe even days. The vibrations didn't stop. Poland hadn't slowed down. It sped over Russia, to areas north of Canada. It was doing laps around Earth. I couldn't believe we were still alive. 

I was quiet. Measuring distance from sinkhole to sinkhole. Noting the places that weren't affected. And calculating the possibilities of where they could arise. 

""There"" I said. Rodney and Jeremy came to my side, ""There's your Fucking heart!"" Jeremy nearly collapsed on the table. Rodney grabbed my shoulders in a congratulatory fashion. 

""Ok so where's the closest base? Who's still available? What's the next step?"" 

""Guys."" 

We all looked over at Judith. 

""It's. It's coming."" 

My heart sank. Would this all have been for nothing? 

All of us in the room looked at each other and appeared to have the same thing on our mind. There was no stopping Poland. And there wasn't enough time to evacuate.

I ran out of the room.

""Where are you going Jordan??"" Jeremy followed me out. Soon everyone was following, as I climbed the stairs to the roof top. 

Up on the roof, panting, I scanned the area, spinning until I saw the direction where I knew Poland would be coming from. 

There it was. Who knows how far it was, but I could see it's disastrous wreckage. The smoke and dust filling the skyline. 

Everyone stood around me. Some people holding each other, others silently staring. There was nothing to do but watch, until we were also absorbed by Poland.

There wasn't even time to recall my fondest memories. My childhood. My family. 

There was only Poland. 

""It's getting closer!"" Another woman sobbed into Judith's arms. 

But then something happened. As the building shook harder... as Poland got closer....

It lifted off the ground. 

What were we witnessing?? 

I fell to my knees, as I saw the large country literally take flight.

""My God..."" Rodney gasped. 

We watched. 

We watched it get higher. 

And higher. 

Until it was above the sky. 

Above the atmosphere. 

Poland was in space. 

After MONTHS of causing chaos all over the planet...

Poland was gone. 


2 months later...

Poland is moving. 

Actually Poland hadn't stopped moving. Ever since it jumped off of Earth, it has been chugging along in space, passing other planets. People who survived Poland, have all come together to build small, close communities. Slowly, life will become normal again. 

""Jordan, are you still here?"" I heard a voice call from down the hall. Of course I knew who it was, and didn't respond. Jeremy popped his head into the conference room. He scanned over the dark room, until he saw me, lit up by a computer screen, in the back corner.  

Quietly he came and sat be me. He cleared his throat, ""Jordan. I'm concerned.""

I didn't look away from the screen. 

""You've been up here, by yourself for weeks now. Poland's been declared 'not a threat' to the planet for a whole month. Please, get up. Come stay with me. Come see how we've rebuilt some cities."" 

I sighed and looked over at him, ""Not yet.""

Jeremy, eyes were sad, ""...I'll be back tomorrow. Please try and get some decent sleep."" As he stood up, he dropped a bag of food on the desk. 

He was a good friend. But I had to stay here. I had to make sure Poland didn't return. I stared at different windows on my screen. One showing earth, one showing emergency updates from all around the world, and one that sent updated images on where Poland was in space. 

I had to keep watching. 

I had to make sure. 

Poland wasn't dead. It was just gone. 

But if it came back, I knew how to kill it. 

So for now, I'll just keep watch.

If you’re reading this, what’s done is done. I’m sorry for everything they say I did. I know that my apologies will never make up for my actions, but it’s all I have left to offer. 

By now, the news has undoubtedly painted me as a blood thirsty psychopath, but know that I had a good reason for everything. It filled me with immense dread and pain, but for the sake of us all, I had to do it. 

Sarah’s Parents: I know you’ll never forgive me. I don’t expect you to. Losing your daughter must have been heartbreaking, let alone the grandkids. The paperwork and instructions for all of our assets are in the top drawer of the armoire. I have a lawyer on standby to liquidate anything you don’t want to provide financial assistance for the both of you. I know it’ll never replace what you lost, but it should relieve that aspect of grief. The photo albums are in the top of the closet. You know Sarah loved to scrapbook so any memory you could want should be there. Just know that what I did was not malicious. I did it out of necessity. 

Hilldale Police Department and any other investigators involved: Everything past this point can be considered my confession. I understand if this document cannot be accepted as of sound mind and body so I have also dictated this to my lawyer and he has a notarized copy that should match up. There is no reason for the investigation to continue. My in-laws have no need to be harassed with questions. Let the case close and let them bury their loved ones. 

Monday 7 July

I was awoken from a nightmare filled with gore and violence. At the foot of my bed sat my two children, John (6) and Sally (9). I got out of bed, got them water and put them back to bed. On my way back to my room, I slipped on the floor and hit my head. While in my daze, I was met by a dark figure that handed me a book and explained that I would know what to do with it when the time came. I got myself up and returned to bed. That morning, on my desk at work, sat the same book. Its dark brown leather bindings were unmistakable. The pages were brittle and yellowed with age. As I turned to the first I was hit with an odor of decay and sulphur. The book began “I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals.” I quickly closed it, immediately recognizing its origin. The book went into my bag and I attempted to finish my day. 

That night, I was blessed with another nightmare. In this one the dark figure spoke to me. What I assume were its eyes stared into mine and in a dark ethereal voice it said “2. 23.” Then I awoke. I scrambled for the book. Inside I turned to chapter 2, page 23 and saw what had to be done. I woke Sarah, told her I had gotten a call from work, and left to begin my preparations. 

When I returned later that day, I called everyone into the family room. They sat on the couch and I stood before them with an air of defeat. “Daddy has to do bad things. Don’t worry, everyone will be okay. Trust me.” Sally and John seemed frightened but assured by my fake confidence. Sarah had a look of quiet disgust and fear. She shoved it down to embrace our children. That evening we had a long discussion where I explained to her my visions and I showed her the book. After some argument and hushed yelling she decided that I should seek mental help and gave me a number to call. Instead I went to the priest. After explaining to him what I felt were the important details, he reassured me that a higher power had a plan for me and my family. His words, undoubtedly meant to be comforting, only cemented in my head what I had to do. I went home that night and prepared for the worst. 

Before I go on, I’m sorry. This wasn’t supposed to happen. I’m no one special. Sure I had my dreams and aspirations but then I got married and had kids. I was a normal suburban man with a normal job. I don’t know why I did what I did, except that I had to. That part was clear. 

Wednesday 9 July

I started with Sally. She had always been meek and soft spoken so I knew she wouldn’t put up much of a fight. She was still asleep in her bed, so I stood in her doorway and watched her sleep. My little angel. After two long years of trying and trying, she surprised us as a welcome Christmas gift. That tiny pink blanket made it so that September would never be the same. When we brought her home she was no bigger than my forearm. The long nights and endless diapers formed the princess that slept so peacefully wrapped in her big kid blanket that we got her when she went to kindergarten. That long beautiful brown hair that her mother meticulously brushed every morning became a dark mess as my hammer connected with the cowlick. Strike after strike with such fury that my face quickly became painted by the tiny red drops of matter that escaped. She didn’t even have a chance to fight. Before either of us knew what happened, she had lost all grip on her teddy bear and slumped into her mattress. I wiped the tears and blood from my face and moved down the hallway. 

As I stood outside John’s door, collecting my breath and calming my quivering emotions, I heard some motion inside. I cracked the door, silhouetting myself with the hallway light. “Daddy, what’s going on?” A tiny voice emerged from the shadows. 

“It’s okay buddy, just lay back down.”  He relaxed back into his pillow as I closed the door behind me. I was already making too much noise so I had to change my approach. Next to his bed was a stuffed stegosaurus that he got for his birthday. We had visited the Utah museum of natural history and it ignited a love of dinosaurs. He had fallen in love with the giant skeleton on display and when they had the stuffy in the gift shop it was a no brainer. He carried that thing home and didn’t let go of it for days. Steggy ate dinner with us, he went on car rides, and he even escorted John to the bathroom during potty training. The love that he had for these prehistoric giants surpassed that of any cartoon or even graham crackers. The plush fake scale texture added a level of grip that allowed it to easily be used to snuff out his young life. As he squirmed under my weight, I could hear him trying to struggle and plead. As he continued yelling “Daddy! Daddy please!” I couldn’t help but break down. When his tiny appendages relaxed and gave in the only sound left was my sobs. I sat on the bed next to him and stroked his hair. I cried so loud that I woke up my wife. 

I raised my head to walk out and Sarah’s eyes met mine in the doorway. The shock and horror on her face ignited a rage in me that I’ve never felt before. She knew what I was doing. She knew why I was doing it. She wasn’t supposed to be involved and now she stood there judging me. I lunged at her and pinned her to the ground. Blow after blow my balled fists connected with her face until it became an unrecognizable pile of hamburger. When she quit fighting, I stood up and cleaned the blood off my hands. As I looked at the bruises and developing defensive wounds from her perfectly manicured nails, I had a realization sweep over me. The things I had done were all in service of a mission, but Sarah was innocent. After cleaning myself to a point of acceptability I ran. 

I hopped in the car and wound up at my dad’s. I walked in as he was finishing his cup of coffee before continuing with his morning routine. My physical condition understandably shocked him and he brought me inside. After assuring him that I was fine I broke down in tears and explained the whole ordeal. He was dumbfounded. The first thing he did was call the police, report the crime at my house, and then he came to me and started working over a strategy. As an old defense attorney himself, he connected me with one of his old colleagues who rushed to the house expecting a bourbon and cigar on the porch. When he arrived my dad paid him and he went to work recording this information and arranging my documents. As he left, my father ushered me upstairs and got me into a shower. Once I was cleaned and changed, he urged me to step into the guest room where I am now writing this letter from. 

I don’t know if I can say it enough, but I am sorry. I only did what I had to. I love my family. I will undoubtedly pay for my actions, but I rest easy knowing that I have lived my life and performed all actions according to his plan and his will. 

Dad: I apologize for the mess. I know you’ll find this letter before the police do, but please return it to where you found it and let them do their work. Thank you for everything you have done for me. Know that you had no part in this. I love you and I always have. I’m sorry for everything. 

This letter was found near the body of Mr. Caleb Whitmore following a Hilldale Police response to a shots fired call from outside the home. The individual was located in the guest room of his father’s house surrounded by photos of his children and wife, who were discovered earlier that day massacred in their home. Mr. Whitmore apparently suffered from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Following an in depth investigation by the Utah Bureau of Investigations, the community continues to reel in the wake of this indescribable tragedy.

Today I tried both V60 and also Switch recipes, and neither really did it.

I tried my traditional 5-pour V60 method:  
20g coffee  
300g water (95 C)  
grinder K-Ultra at 0.7  
five 60-gram pours  
Taste was ok but not magical at all, and it feels like it was a bit bitter but without body either.

I went to the Switch and did a ""simpler"" recipe of what I call the french press on Switch:  
20g coffee  
300g water (95 C)  
grinder K-Ultra at 0.7  
valve closed entire time  
60g bloom for 1 minute  
pour the rest to 300g  
wait until 4minutes, open valve  
finished at 4:45  
Taste was confusing again... different than with V60, but still weird. I kinda think it leaves a subtle dry mouth so it makes me think it was under extracted.

Often times, my problem is determining (from the failed cup) which direction or variable to change. I've watched a million videos and it seems to make sense what they do, but it assumes you know what you taste and can use that to drive an intelligent variable change.   
Part of me feels like if I had a coffee refractometer that might help me understand under/over extraction and teach my taste buds/brain better? What is everyone else's experience here? ",0,1765144327.0,pourover,0,0.5,False
1pguprd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pguprd/little_black_worm_short_story/,Little Black Worm (Short Story),"I sighed as I tried to unzip my ancient army coat. The damn zipper was caught again.

*You really should have waxed it like your father had told you to.*

He was right, as usual.

I should have waxed it when I had the chance. Now I looked like a fool trapped in a green duffel bag. I tried again in vain to break free from the confines of my jacket until I admitted defeat and slipped the coat up and over my head. 

I threw the restraint onto my bed and plopped down next to it.

*You really shouldn't have said that tonight; it was such a strange addition to the conversation. You should really be more sensitive to others' feelings.*

Right again.

""Hopefully she will still come to next month's movie,"" I said to myself as I walked to the mirror to wash off tonight's events.

*You shouldn't put your hopes up*. The little black worm whispered in my ear. Of course, He was never wrong, but some nights I secretly wished He would be. I scrupulously wiped away the dirt and toweled off as I looked at myself in the mirror. I could see the little black worm wriggling under my skin. His bulbous, uneven body creating ripples in my cheeks, wriggling and writhing its way down to my neck.

*Perhaps if you reveal a bit more of what is underneath, she will forgive you.*

He was never wrong. 

The worm slowly made His way down my shoulders and into my forearms as I obeyed His orders. The little black worm and I had been living in this routine ever since I could remember.

Throughout our life together, the worm had grown and grown with every order I followed. At first, He was no larger than a scratch or a small scrape. Through high school, He grew to about the length of a finger or two with a thick body that would wrap His way around my throat and arms. Sometimes the worm was able to take over certain parts of my body to help me. He would shimmy to my ankles if my legs had frozen to keep me walking, or wrap around my larynx to stop me from speaking. Although He had caused great anguish throughout my life, I was thankful for His help. Without my little black worm, I would be nothing.

But, there were moments, of course, very rare occasions, that the worm would frighten me. Sometimes, His maternal whisper, soft and quiet in my ear, would become a thunderous hiss that would reverberate into my skull, bouncing from every bone, vein, and nerve. Sometimes I would try to drown Him out, but I would always be able to hear His orders.

*YOU SHOULD BE WORKING* 

*WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?* 

*YOU BELONG TO ME* 

*YOU CANNOT IGNORE ME*

*FEED ME*

Sometimes, the aggravation and rage of the worm would become too much, and I knew I would need to be punished.

*Feed me with your hands, reveal the inside, the truth, you know the shame you bring.*

I would follow my orders, but I knew this was all done from love. The worm loved me; He helped me. He told me what to do, and I obeyed.

I washed the blood from my hands and made a sleepy march from the bathroom to my bed. Sweet, sweet bed.

I had been spending more and more time in bed lately. While I protested this growing habit, the worm insisted it would help.

*You should rest; that is why you have not returned. We need to rest.*

I watched as the worm climbed between my veins into my thighs. When I was younger, this visual frightened me. A thick, meaty tube that writhed just under my skin like a moving bruise. The purple-black hue of its alien body clearly visible under my skin. Mum always said I bruised like a peach, just like her.

I winced as the worm continued to search my body. Sometimes I could dilute the pain through certain positions that created an easier path through my maze of muscles and flesh. It never used to hurt, but since the coffee spilled, it felt like the worm had grown thorns, scraping deep scars into my meat that burned with every inch traveled. I had reached a point where I now needed to sleep on dark sheets to avoid the suspicion of blood as He oozed from my body at night.

*You should accept your fate. This is done out of love*.

I knew this was the truth. The worm loved me. He wanted to protect me.

He hissed in agreement as He moved His polluted shadow from my hips up my throat. Recently, the worm had started blocking my throat. Not to block any life from entering, but to allow a moment of pause while I considered His orders. Although I always obeyed, it was a reminder of how He had built me to be the best version of myself. I owed my life to the worm. I loved the worm.

I stared down at the holy silver in my hand. Love was a strange thing. Some days, it revealed such beauty in the world that you could scarcely believe it to be true; other days, it lifted the veil and revealed the cold underbelly that supported this illusion. Of course, the worm always told me that I existed to create this illusion for others.

*You should be thrilled to have the opportunity to create this for others.*

*Why would it exist for you?*

The wise, ancient serpent continued climbing my muscle tissue. His grotesque, thick body clouded my vision as I watered the tendrils that escaped from my mouth. A sticky ooze excreting from its oily skin sealed my lips. But this was normal; the worm knew what was best. He loved me.

*You should not think of me as a burden but as a martyr. I save you while living beneath your skin. I exist only for you. Someday I will grow to save others, and you will come with me.*

The snake grew and elongated into my limbs and spine. Its reptilian skin growning and sharpening with each notch down my back. I could feel Him replacing the muscles in my body. Taking control.

*We could live together, exist in eternity. You could make them proud. You could remove their pain, their suffering.*

I thought of my family, my friends, and the pain that life had dealt them at my expense. I thought of eternity as the snake continued into the vast crevices in my decaying, mushy cranium. An eternity of servitude with my master. Freedom.

I raised the familiar grey weight in my hand.

After all, the worm was always right.",1,1765144304.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,0,1.0,False
1pgupap,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgupap,Rose’s Viet Subs on Dundas West at Spadina,"First thing, *Rose’s Viet Subs* is a new place that just opened on Dundas West has no connection to the very similarly named *Rose’s Vietnamese Sandwiches* which was on Gerrard near Broadview for many years and now closed. Confirmed after speaking with my server. 

In addition to banh mi, this new Rose’s also has xoi sticky rice dishes, bun vermicelli bowls, drinks and desserts. Everything is reasonably priced at $10 or less. 

Tried out their char siu banh mi ($8). Pleasantly surprised at how big and generously filled the sandwich was compared to nearby banh mi mainstays Ba Le and Nguyen Huong. Overall very tasty. Especially the housemade pate and sate. 

During their soft opening you get a complementary drink or dessert. The coconut coffee I had a nice strong coffee flavour and the creamy coconut helped tame the spicy bite from the sate. 

Definitely will be back soon. (PS: there’s a Tianjin crepe place that also just opened next door that I noticed…)

For as long as man has existed upon the earth, he has battled the forces of nature as much as those around him. The fight for survival has always been beyond that of sticks and stones. No matter how sharp a stick can get or how fast a rock can fly, no skill defeats that of the predators that make up the food chain. We thought we had defeated the food chain, but that couldn’t have been further from the truth.



When I received the call about my father’s death, I was unsurprised. He had spent his days drinking and regretting. I assumed his liver had given out or he had taken an ill advised road trip that hopefully didn’t cause any undue suffering for anyone but himself. I would almost say I was happy. Ever since the loss of the rest of my family, I had felt alone knowing that the only tie I had to my heritage was isolating himself in a 6 inch glass and an old recliner. Now I was truly free. There was no more regret, no stains on my family tree. Just me and what the lawyer needed to discuss in person. I informed work of a sabbatical and booked a ticket back to what was once home.



Sitting in the meager office across from an individual in a cheap suit, I realized there would be no money. He confirmed the same. My father had spent every dime that he had. What he spent it on was the most confusing. We weren’t a well off family. Growing up, I remembered nights of hunger and cold. The type of hunger that couldn’t be quelled with a box of Hamburger Helper split between five and the type of cold that no kerosene heater low on fuel can warm. When I left for the coast, I swore to never put myself in that situation again. I only wish I could’ve saved my siblings from the fate that I escaped. When I saw the story in the news, it broke me. Three people, one adult and two children under ten, were found huddled together under a worn out quilt with acute methane poisoning. At least it was easy on them and they would be warm. He lived because he was at the bar. The bar never suffered from hunger or cold, but it did suffer from loneliness. The loneliness drove him deeper until there was no escape. He filled that loneliness with a desire for legacy. If nothing else, there would be a plot of land with our name on it. 



The lawyer handed me the deed to 35 Acres in the mountains of Appalachia. My father never was one for the wild, but the wildest land is often the cheapest. This land was wild. Between a plane ride, a confused Uber, and a long walk, I came upon a small cabin reminiscent of the Kaczynski estate. Buried deep in the darkness of the Blue Ridge Forest was the perfect metaphor for my life. This dilapidated building, filled with relics of a time gone by, served as the blueprint for my new life. Out here I could return to the basics and restart. I took to cleaning and sealing my new home. 



The first night was an adjustment to say the least. There was no traffic noise. No sirens. No arguments from the family next door who swore the baby would fix their problems. It was only the noises of nature. The cicadas and animals created a symphony of sound that rivaled that of big city life. I can honestly say I hadn’t slept that great in years. That is until I was awoken by the crying. The clock read 2:45 and in some far off part of the holler there was a baby crying out for its mother. The desperation and fear in it’s tiny wails turned my stomach to knots and forced me outside. Once through the threshold, all sounds ceased. For the first time since I arrived, the woods were quiet. I looked everywhere that the safety of my porch provided a view of and sunk back inside. 



In the light of morning, I convinced myself I had dreamed the whole thing up. There wasn’t a person for miles, let alone a baby. How would it even get out here? I took the trip into town and picked up the essentials. It may not be the luxury that I had grown accustomed to, but a basic bed and food supplies gave me the comfort I needed to return that evening. I thought about questioning the shopkeep about the baby but knew he’d think I was crazy. Hell, I thought I was crazy. On the ride back to my cabin, I understood the suggestion of the gator I picked up on the terrain. No car or truck could make it up this far, not with the goat trails and backways I had to take. The UTV had everything I needed and I guess it would help me learn to maintain small engines. I had taught myself to do just about everything else I needed to survive, I could surely figure out how to turn a wrench. 



That night was more of the same. Crickets singing and a cool evening breeze put me to sleep. Much to my dismay, the baby came back. Same volume, same cadence. That poor thing continued to scream for a mother that wasn’t coming. I went outside to check, this time with a flashlight, and ventured all the way to my woodline. No matter how far I walked, the screams remained. I didn’t get closer or farther, the screams were everywhere. They were nowhere. They seemed to resonate from the very fiber of all of the gray matter crammed inside my skull cavity. At the risk of losing the rest of my night’s rest, I elected to ignore the pleas and returned to the warmth of my bed. 



As the sun broke the horizon, I rose to a cup of coffee brewed over a wood stove. Something about the work involved made it that much better. As I finished the cup I went to work. Trees needed to be cleared. The outside of my cabin needed some patchwork. Land ownership turned out to be a bigger hassle than I could have ever dreamed. The work was hard, but fulfilling. Where I could be in an office pumping out quarterly reports and spreadsheets, I was out here in the thick of it creating a place to live. Whether he had planned it or not, my father had given me the greatest gift he could’ve. He gave me a greater purpose. All of that came into question when I discovered the prints.



Underneath a pile of brush were footprints. Not bear, not coyote, but human footprints. They were smaller than my own, and my feet aren’t exactly large. They were almost childlike. I took pictures and sent them to a friend of mine from college in the hopes he would tell me it’s some animal I’m unaware of. Before I could return my phone to my pocket, I received a phone call from an unknown number. A friendly male voice answered my greeting on the other line. “This is Dr. Simmons with the paleontological department of UCLA. I have been setting up an ichnological study of the native populations in the Alleghania region and I was sent a picture that you took. Do you have a second to speak?” I agreed and we talked about the area where I found them and what led me to the discovery. He urged me to preserve the site as best as I can and that he would be in touch with further information on how I could be helpful. 



With the excitement of the day, I lost track of time in the thoughts of what treasures could be on my land. Before I knew it, the sun had set. I had never been this far from the house in the dark. I quickly realized I had no idea where I was or how to get back. A storm had followed the night and apparently took all cell service with it. This is the exact situation that the old man in town told me to pick up a satellite phone for. I didn’t have time to figure out whether or not I regretted leaving that off my shopping list before I heard it.



From somewhere deeper than my eyes could pierce, I heard a voice. “Shane.” Small, echoey, and distant. The softness in that one word drew my attention and my response. “Hello? Can I help you?” From the opposite side, I heard it again. This time closer. With every hair on my body standing on edge I stepped toward the sound when it was suddenly behind me. “SHANE.” The voice had lost all sense of familiarity. Now it was hunting. I didn’t want to hang around long enough to find out what was hunting so I took off running. I found a goat trail that had recently been trampled and followed it until my legs began to fail me. I collapsed on the trail and scanned the treeline as I caught my breath. Behind every tree was a darting shadow and every birdsong seemed to call my name. I was clearly going mad with fear, so I gathered myself and began to walk back. The rain had washed away at parts of the trail and as they crumbled beneath my feet, I was reminded of my elevation. This reminder sealed itself in my mind when I followed the soil down. After two bounces, everything went black. 



The Allegewi tell tales of man-hunters in the mountains surrounding our country's founding. Tales of hideous beasts that steal the young and escape the arrows of the warbow. My minimal education wrote these off as allegories of infant mortality and disease. What they failed to teach was the true history of the range. What we know today as the Appalachian mountains exist as one of earth’s oldest land masses. In the days of fish crawling to land, there were the mountains. When magic and mystery ruled the land in days of yore, there stood the mountains. As I careened to my ultimate demise, there stood the mountains.



When I came to, I had come to rest at the base of a tree. Between the pain in my ribs and the splitting headache, I couldn’t have hated this place more. I could be in a high rise apartment preparing for my work day tomorrow but instead I lay dying against a tree that hadn’t seen humanity in its entire life. I cursed my father for saddling me with this land. I cursed my mother for convincing me to leave home. I cursed my stupidity for having fallen. As I came to my feet, I heard a scurry through the leaves. My mind went on high alert and for a moment I forgot the remnants of my little tumble. Out of the underbrush came a rabbit. It’s pure white fur glistening against the darkness of the night. It studied me intensely and went on its way. I relaxed out of my sense of survival and returned to dealing with the pain. 



About the time that I was able to try walking, I heard it. The crying began in the same location it always does. Just out of reach the infant screamed. Tonight it seemed more desperate and shrill, but that could’ve also been the concussion. I hobbled towards the sound when everything closed in. My vision tunneled to nothing more than the tree in front of me and the drums started. Broken ribs be damned, I took off running. From every crevice in the earth came the drums. Pounding. Screaming. Closing in. I ran. I ran until the drums filled every hole in my body. I could taste the aged leather of the heads and feel the strike of the stick in my bone marrow. As the drumming seemed to engulf me, I broke through the trees. 



Just as suddenly as they had started, everything stopped. I was once again alone with the crickets and cicadas in the wet night. Up ahead, I saw the lantern I left burning the previous night. I collected all of the strength I had and made my way to it’s warm safety. As I approached the porch, what I saw stopped me more than any pain I could feel. Splayed out on the first step was that rabbit. It’s fur stained a dark crimson red and a hole where that deep black marble had been. It’s neck was turned at an angle that sent a shiver down my spine. Someone, or something, left this so that I would see it. It let me get home, it left me a message, and I couldn’t help but feel that it watched me. 



I made my way inside and finally gave in to the pain. When I woke, it was dark out. The chill of the night reminded me where I was. I sat up and was reminded of the events of the night before. I made my way to what had become my medicine cabinet and filled myself with just about everything I had that involved pain relief. After giving that time to take effect, I made my way outside. The rabbit remained on my doorstep, untouched by any of the countless scavengers that surrounded me unseen. I made my way to the UTV parked outside and it roared to life. I neglected to check the fuel levels and set on my way to town. Hopefully they had a doctor or at the very least an old man with narcotics. 



Driving down the road, if you could call it that, I felt the Ibuprofen lose the battle I sent it to unprepared. My vision blurred and the pain in my side returned as I attempted to keep the vehicle steady. When the blood pumped through the swollen mass that used to be my ribs, I instinctively folded to guard the area. This sent the gator into the ravine beneath me. It came to a rest at the bottom and I staggered out. 



At the top of the hill, where there existed the only way out of my hell, I saw something dart toward the trees. It made no noise. The leaves and fallen branches seemed to move away from it. The speed at which it moved sent me back into the fight or flight that unfortunately seemed to be all too normal. I made my way to my feet and felt a rush of wind behind me. It called my name. “Sshhaaaneeee.” It almost seemed to sing and mock me. Another rush of wind. Then my name again. It seemed to be everywhere and nowhere. The voice continued to harass me as I stumbled toward the road. It circled me. It seemed to multiply and then disappear. The entire wilderness was involved in this things plan for me. I felt the eyes of an unknown predator feeling my heart race and hone in on my new weaknesses. Just as I felt it’s hot breath on the back of my neck, my feet were ripped out from under me. I was dragged back to the bottom of the ravine and the beast drooled onto my back. I buried my face in an attempt to convince myself this wasn’t happening as I felt a claw on my shoulder. 



The uncanny valley is a concept that exists in the depths of our mind. In essence, it is the idea that we are naturally afraid of those things that aren’t quite human. This has been explained away by science as a natural defense against the disease that comes from the dead. As this beast forced me to stare into it’s eyes, I understood where that fear had begun. When writers speak of the old gods and the eldritch horrors, they are unknowingly warning us of what I experienced. Between the hazel eyes that set on either side of its maw and the elongated neck, this thing did not fit any known animal that I could place. The strength with which it supported my dead weight rivaled that of the strongest man. The extended claws that wrapped around and pierced my upper arm made it very clear the inspiration of our most primitive weapons. It’s jaw unfolded and revealed a mouth of gnarled fangs that each came to their own serrated point. It’s breath burned the hair off of my face and brought a nauseous urge to the back of my throat. As I made peace with whatever would listen and accepted my fate, a sharp snap cut through the air.



I fell to the ground and watched the beast sprint into the forest with a howl. I collapsed onto the ground and heard a familiar voice behind me. “Shane, you never told me how bad this had gotten.” I turned to put a face to the voice of Dr. Simmons and breathed a sigh of relief. The adrenaline rushed out of me and I gave in to the exhaustion that had been plaguing me since my arrival. When I woke, I was blinded by the sterility of a hospital room. In the corner sat Dr. Simmons with a laptop open. He paused his typing to look up and his eyes met mine. “Shane my boy! I could have never imagined what you were getting me into. I almost feel lied to.” He let out a chuckle. “Now you rest up and we will talk in the morning.” 



After a couple of days in the hospital, I was released to my own accord. I couldn’t stand the idea of returning to that cabin, so I checked myself into the local motel. Dr. Simmons met me at the desk and I gave him full permission to do whatever he wanted with my land and donated anything found to his studies. He shook my hand and left with the giddyness of a child given permission to swim. I retired to my room, ready to sleep before figuring out how to get rid of the curse I had been bestowed. As my eyes became heavy, the darkness overtook me. As I settled in for a long night of much needed rest, I heard the first beat of the drums in the distance.

1pgup0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pgup0x/i_dont_know_how_i_feel_about_this_girl/,I don't know how I feel about this girl,"I have been talking and hanging out with a girl for around a month now, we initially met on Tinder. After talking for a while over tinder we agreed that we both wanted to hook up, but met up for coffee in person first. We get along well, she's funny, emotionally mature, smart, motivated, we are both nerdy people and enjoy spending time together. We both agreed that the romantic spark was not there, and hooked up. The sex was good so we decided to have a FWB relationship. We text every day, throughout the whole day and hang out fairly regularly. I am a full time student, and she knows that, and is supportive of me while also cheering me on. She tells me about upcoming job interviews she has and I want to see her succeed in them so she can be in a position that she isn't so stressed about. We have talked about our ex's, mental health struggles, past experiences and more. We have only had sex twice so far and we cuddle afterwards, and when we hang out without hooking up, we still cuddle together and we're flirty with each other. 

However, I feel like things are changing. In the beginning, we went through each others dating profiles and swiped/liked men and women for each other, but not taking our activity on said apps seriously, having the mindset of ""whatever happens, happens"" if that makes any sense. I've noticed that when I'm talking to a girl on Hinge or something, I'm not really invested in the conversation. I've only been on one date since meeting this girl and nothing came of it. She has been hanging out with people from the apps too, but she tells me that the two people she's spent time with seem more like friends than anything more. When she asks me to go through her tinder, I find myself not liking the idea of her going out with another guy because we wouldn't spend as much time together. She's told me the same thing, that she is ""mentally preparing for me to date someone else, because she would miss the intimacy we have and spending time together,"" and if I'm being honest, I would too. 

She's told me that I meet her ""high standards"" of a potential partner (kind, emotionally mature, motivated, funny, etc.) and once she told me that she ""kind of wishes we did connect romantically."" I feel comfortable around her and I believe she is comfortable around me. On our most recent hang out, she asked me out on a date and I said yes. 

The problem is that I'm not sure the romantic spark is there. I know that is something that can't be forced, but at the same time, it feels like if my mind keeps coming back to the idea of us dating, that shouldn't be something that I dismiss/ignore. I get the feeling that she wants more than our FWB situation, but I'm not totally sure how I feel about that. I feel like I have to be totally sure of want I want before moving forward with anything and I shouldn't have any doubt in my mind. We both are anxious people and while I know she values open communication and honesty, I doubt that she would be the first to say anything. Am I just not wanting to open up because I don't want a repeat of the relationship I had with my ex? I told her about how my ex wanted me to read her mind a lot, and this girl said she hates it when people do that and she likes to just tell people what she's thinking and I see that as a green flag.  

I'm confused about my emotions. Maybe I do know what I want, but I'm just to frighten to admit it to myself. Should I tell her how I feel? Has anyone else had this experience? I could really use some advice.

“Unfortunately son, you’ll never walk again.”

I’ll never forget those words. My mom cried, my dad left with the doctor. When I got in my buddy’s car, we thought we were bulletproof. Maybe we were, but we weren’t telephone pole proof. The next 6 months were a blur of physical therapy and prayer. I didn’t even know we belonged to a church, all of a sudden we’re in the front row and people are walking around my new chair to take communion. It all felt so forced. Maybe that’s why we stopped going as soon as the PT confirmed what the doctor had cursed me with. 

It’s surprisingly easy to learn how to be differently abled. The looks and fake pity wore off after the first week. The handicap placard came in the mail the same day as the hospital bill. By the time I got to college, I was used to asking for accommodations. As I rolled across the stage, I could see a future of elevators and aisle seats sprawled out before me. I placed the framed degree on my wall as the mail fell through the door. On top was a non-descript letter with no return address that caught my attention. 

YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED

The big bold letters on the front signed this letter's ticket to the junk pile. After sorting everything, I went back to my day. Everytime I passed my credenza though, that letter caught my eye. I knew it was just a credit card scam or a personal loan, but there was something about it. Eventually I gave in and took it to my office. Picking up my letter opener I was weirdly anxious. This was a piece of mail. What did I even have to be anxious about? News headlines popped in my head: “Local idiot falls victim to mail bomb,” “The Unibomber strikes from the grave,” “Are the handicapped more susceptible to anthrax: results may shock you.”
Inside the envelope wasn’t nearly that exciting. 

It contained a piece of paper with an address and a phone number. The address was some field in the middle of nowhere Tennessee and the phone number went to an automated line. A very chipper, albeit obviously recorded, voice picked up with pretty standard fare. “Congratulations. You have been selected as a candidate for our brand new program.” Obviously a scam. “Please prepare to record the details of our offer!”

Then the voice changed. Now it’s a very robotic AI type. The tone didn’t’t matter. The voice could’ve been anything when it said my name. Then the recording came back to ask me to confirm. When I did, the robot returned. 
“You are now suffering from paralysis. Would you like to regain your life?”

I didn’t know what to say. What was this? It had to be some kind of joke. After a moment with no response, it came back, “Joseph, do you want your legs back? Yes or no?”

I responded with a half hearted, shaky yes and the only response I got was “two days.” Then the line went silent. Thoughts escaped me. I considered calling my mom, but she’d never believe me. My dad would get confused and accuse me of falling for a scam. All that I had was to wait and see what happened to me. 

Two days later, I woke up just as I had for years. Pulled my legs out of bed. Moved into my chair. Got ready for the day. Went into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. Made my way to the office and saw another envelope on the floor. This one was blank. Same size, same shape, same everything minus the writing. I scooped it up and noticed some weight. When I got it open, there was a plane ticket with my name on it. No other information. No airline, destination, departure gate, nothing. There was my name, today’s date, and a weird seal that I’ve never seen. To put it into words, an octopus with wings. Something about it felt sinister, but I threw the papers in the trash.

I was google searching scams involving travel, medical issues, weird marine-biologists. Really anything that could help me figure it out. This was interrupted by a car horn. I made my way to the door and outside stood a blacked-out Cadillac. I assumed it must be my neighbor’s until someone got out and started walking to my door. I backed away in time for the door to open and the man made eye contact with me. 

“Mr. Tuttle?” I sat in silence. “I will be your escort for the duration of your travel. Please follow me.” And he walked out just as swiftly as he came in. I don’t know why, but I followed him. He opened the back door and gave me a hand getting settled. He folded my chair and placed it in the back. I closed my door and away we went. 

We drove for what felt like hours. The entire time, I couldn’t get stories of abductions and the countless missing posters I had seen pasted all over town out of my head. Was I being abducted? Does this count as an abduction? I did go willingly. This man was being nothing but cordial so far. Aren’t kidnappers supposed to be gruff and rude? The silence was broken as we slowed for a turn. 

“Do you have your ticket?” 

“I’m sorry, what?”

“The ticket you received. Did you bring it?”

“No, I think it’s on my desk.”

“No worries. We’ll get you one sorted.” Then he tossed my passport into the seat beside me. I was working up the courage to ask who he was or how he got it when we came to a stop. 

I’m by no means an aviation expert, but I did go through a phase as a kid. When I say this was the most beautiful, wellkept Cessna Citation Jet I’d ever seen, I mean it. Granted, I didn’t have a ton of experience in private jets. But none of that mattered. The driver opened my door and I was met with a flight attendant type that had my chair ready to go and a ramp that was almost certainly special made. I rolled right up into the plane and made myself comfortable. She came over and gave me a brief safety run down and asked if I was comfortable. 

“Mr. Straker informed us that you would require certain accommodations and we are here to provide. Just say the word.”
She then placed a drink in front of me and disappeared to the rear. I hesitantly took a sip and found the drink to be quite pleasant. Somehow they had perfectly captured the taste of peanuts in a coke and poured it into my glass. After that sip didn’t make my mouth tingly or make me throw up, I quite enjoyed it. As we escaped the ground, I felt a heaviness come over my body. 

When I woke up, the flight attendant was taking my trash as we prepared to descend. I asked her where we were but she just smiled and walked away. The plane lands, I make my way off and I’m greeted by my driver. Same song and dance, same Cadillac. If not for the extreme humidity change, you could convince me we never left. He pulled the car to a stop in front of an office building. That’s what I’d call it if it was anywhere else. In comparison to the huts and dilapidated buildings surrounding it, the building loomed with a dark aura. The beating sun was blotted out by its massive footprint and then reflecting off its millions of windows. The locals didn’t seem to notice. Or if they did, they didn’t point it out to me. If I was in a monster movie, lightning would be striking the peak with crows circling about. 

Inside was sterile. Glistening white marble accentuated by an onyx black desk with a rather attractive woman sitting behind it. When the door shut behind us, she looked up from her computer and came running to greet us. 

“Oh my god! It’s so nice to meet you! I’m Holly. Victor has told us so much about you. Can I get you a water?”

I was taken aback. No one yet had been this bubbly. Everyone was nice, but reserved. Holly was your stereotypical valley girl who acted like she had met a puppy. I’d be lying if I said the female attention wasn’t nice. She guided me to a seating area and for the first time there wasn’t anything special. I parked my chair next to the empty ones and waited. 

After a few minutes, I heard the comically loud creak of a door down the hallway followed by a slam that shook the empty room. As heels struck the polished floors, my anxiety returned at not knowing who I’d be meeting. The steps stopped at a door, opened it and shared some words and then another set of feet joined. This happened a couple of times until an entourage entered my view. The group of generic office types stopped, almost in sync, and parted to let the organizer through. Out of this mob of middle managers came a man that could’ve graced Forbes circa 1985. The sharp collar, gelled hair, and suspenders made this man look like he had been transported through time to be here with me today. The illusion was broken when he removed an iPhone from his pocket and silenced the ringer. 

“Ah, Mr. Tuttle. It is so nice to finally meet.”
His voice filled me with a sense of despair that was only slightly diminished by his salesman’s charisma. 

“I am Mr. Straker, but as I’m sure Holly informed you, everyone calls me Victor.”
He extended his hand for a shake and I met with hesitation. 

“We are so glad to finally have you here with us at our facility. Since our inception, we have dreamed of a day to improve someone in your situation.”

His gesture melted my walls of uncertainty, and he noticed. “Now that you’re here, let’s get you settled. Afterwards we can get you on a tour.”
I am led by my escort to the elevator. He presses the top button and we ascend. I can’t help but notice that every button except the top and lobby are locked behind a card scanner. As we reach the floor, the elevator dings and we enter into a massive room. If this were the Hilton, I’d call it the presidential suite. Except everything was at eye level. Lowered counter tops, mirrors touching the ground, even the doorknobs were lower. I went into one of the bedrooms and it even had larger spaces beside the bed for my chair. It’s almost as if this room was made for me. I was pulled out of my awe by the escort saying something. I asked him to repeat and, in a much sterner tone, he sighed, “Dinner at 6. Get ready for your tour.” And shut the door. Get ready? I hadn’t even had the chance to pack bags. I went into the bedroom and found the drawers and closet stuffed with track suits my exact measurements. There must have been two dozen. If not for everything else, I might’ve found this weird. I must admit, I was pretty hungry. I got changed into the branded suit and made my way to the elevator. The escort was there waiting for me and scanned his card to open the door as I approached. We made our way back down but not to the lobby. I didn’t catch what number he pushed but the lights indicated that we were dropping well below that. I hadn’t even noticed those buttons earlier. 

On the outside of the sliding doors was Victor. He had changed into formal garden wear and presented a much more laid back appearance. Once again I was met with a handshake and away he walked down the hallway. Instinctually I followed. As we rounded the corner to a locked door, he finally spoke. 

“Here at Straker Industries, we are the leading innovators in all things improvement. As a matter of fact, that’s where my grandfather came up with our slogan ‘We fix what he overlooked.’ Grandfather was a religious man, but he never felt that his image was the peak. So he opened our first facility.” He outstretched his hands and the doors opened for him. We stepped over the threshold and a wave of calm came over me. I expected a corporate hellscape or a doctor’s waiting room. Instead I found a museum. As Victor and I walked he recounted years of history. There was a picture of his relative with Henry Ford, a group of people outside of Tut’s Tomb, the group picture of Apollo 11, the list goes on. I couldn’t help but notice a large chunk of time missing. I had to stop him. “How did you guys make it through the Depression?”

“We simply explored some foreign endeavors that paid out when they needed to.” This was technically an answer, but not quite satisfactory. I decided to let sleeping dogs lie and we continued the tour. I had zoned off until we reached the next door. He paused and reached for the handles. “This here, is what we’re really proud of” was all he said before throwing the doors open. 

When you hear stories of Neverland ranch or Suddam’s palace, the first thing people talk about are the zoos. I have heard so many stories about the tigers and the monkeys and whatever else they could get their hands on. Those did not prepare me for what was behind that hatch. The first window we passed was not dissimilar to a primate cage at the zoo. These apes could not be happy. The constant yelling and screaming was deafening. Victor yelled something over the noise but I couldn’t break my attention away from the smallest one. 

Standing about 3.5 feet tall, he was hunched over a children’s toy. As the only one not screaming, I shared his focus with the task at hand. As he sorted small blocks into the proper holes, I was amazed. This level of intellectualism is what I was told separated us from the monkeys. He must have noticed I was looking. As his eyes met mine, I was filled with sadness. The eyes looked human. I could tell he was scared. He wanted out, to see the world. Only then did I notice the patches of hair. All over the small frame, there were patches of black wiry hair. Not like it had lost hair, but like it had grown new. Then I noticed the shape of the face. It wasn’t elongated, more circular. Then I saw the limbs. As I started to put together what I had seen, Mr. Straker re-entered my consciousness. “Alopecia. Doesn’t matter how many of them we get, they can’t grow hair right.” Away we walked. Nothing more. As we entered the next set of doors, the screams subsided, except one. If you’d told me there was a child screaming for its mother, you would’ve described the sound that stood my hair on edge. 

The trap between doors came with a rush of air and an unlocking. This time there was no enclosure. The room was empty except for a figure in the corner. Victor's voice got low and he started to creep. “This next specimen is one that we worked years on. After many attempts, this one seems to have worked.” Before I had time to process what he had said, the figure's head snaps around and I hear the rattle of an iron chain as it stands up to meet our gaze. As the creature fully unfolded, I felt a deep resentment for the curse of creation. Its bare appearance left no gory detail to the imagination. From the shadow, I witnessed the silhouette of two legs, then three, then four. None the same size as the other. Then the torso, wider than any man, gave way to a matching number of arms. At the apex of this mass of natural crime was a keg of what I could only call a head. The thing stumbled into the light and it somehow got worse. Down the center of this creature was a seam. Something, or someone, fused these beings. These people. The eyes shot a look at mine of pain and suffering. With labored breathing and out of sync blinking, the being attempted to speak. The garbled mess of spit and grunts was interrupted by Mr. Straker cutting in with something about organ health and donation. I focused in on the being and reached out to touch it. As I did, the escort grabbed my chair. I hadn’t even realized he was there. I was wheeled out of the room, but I could swear it worked out a “save” between groans and sputters. Those eyes. I’ll never forget those eyes. 

As the door shut behind me, Straker wiped his hands with a handkerchief and let out a sigh. “Well, wasn’t that something? Now that you have seen our successes, we hope that you can begin to understand the importance of our work and your part to play.”

“I can’t say that I do understand where I fit into all of this.”

“Well.” He seemed flustered. “Nothing we can’t fix with dinner.” He clapped his hands together and took off down the hallway. I followed into a glorious dining room. The art on the wall alone made this a rival to the ballrooms of Versailles. At the center was a rather intimate table with two settings. I had assumed I would be eating with Victor, but at the head of the table was Holly. She had transformed from her valley girl, business casual appearance in the lobby to a woman befitting James Bond. The slit in her dress went almost as high as the top went low. Her yellow bun had become golden locks that danced around her delicate shoulders. The hands that had been clicking away at her computer now had elegantly manicured nails and looked to be unspoiled by the hardships of life. As she stood to greet me, I almost did the same. 

We enjoyed the many spoils that came with endless funds. The steaks, the caviar, everything was perfect. They brought out a tiramisu that rivaled the ambrosia of Olympus. And the wine. From a Riesling that was lost during the Second World War to a Heisdeck Champagne from the Titanic. Everything was perfect. Afterwards, Holly and I spent time chatting about the art and what life was like with Straker. As the night continued, so did the wine. Then brandy. Then more wine. After a couple of hours, I had found a friend in the least likely of places. We head to the elevator, she scans her card, and follows me into the capsule. The door to my room opens, and we stroll into my new abode. She tells me that she’ll meet me in the next room and heads to grab more wine. I move towards the door and that’s as much as I remember. 

The next morning, all of the blood has returned to my head with a vengeance. I’ve had my party nights, but nothing had hit me this hard. The window allows a beam of heat into my world, blistering my sensitive corneas. I make my way to the bathroom and immediately reminded myself of what made me feel this way. After I clean myself up, I go to get dressed in today’s track suit and I find a glass of water, two unassuming pills, and a note. “Thought you might need these. -H.” She really must care. As I approach the elevator, the door opens and I meet the escort again. “Mr. Straker expresses his regret that he could not meet you this morning.” I was in no mood for conversation so I let out a groan and down we go. This time to floor 9. The elevator stops but the doors do not open. Instead the escort stands there with a physical key inserted, staring at a red light. As the light turns green, he twists the key and the room is filled with blinding light. Out of the brightness steps a silhouette with outstretched arms. 

“Welcome. Are you ready?” I rubbed my eyes and Victor came into focus. He took my hand and gave it a vigorous shake. “Are you ready, my boy? This is where we make wishes come true.” He leads me into what I at first thought was a hospital. People standing in groups, wearing scrubs and face shields. Everyone had a table on which they were vehemently focused. The only clue to what was so interesting was the occasional tool request and leaking mystery fluid. As we passed through the decon chamber and I was fitted with my own mask, I got a better look. On every table was a torso. These people looked to be medical students doing a cadaver lab, but they were still bleeding. The back side of the room had a locked door full of muffled noises. I inquired about the source and was brushed off. As we continued moving forward, I was told something about scientific advancement and the study of the human form. My focus was divided between trying to listen to what was being said and that room. One of the larger strangers takes a bag full of the remains of one of the tables and heads towards the door. As he opens it, I catch a glimpse of a man in a coat with a saw and the noise became screams for half a second. Shortly after we exit the room. The escort helps me onto a table of my own and I refuse to lay down. Victor comes around into frame, now wearing his own scrubs, and begins to explain my procedure. 

“What we have found is that the best way to cure bad blood is to replace it. In your case, we believe your legs are full of the stuff.” He pointed to an MRI on the board. “Here and here are your problem areas. As our research has found, the best procedure for someone like you is the full replacement of the host limb…” he continued speaking but I zoned out. In my distracted state, the escort grabbed my forehead and forced me down. I felt the straps close on my head and arms. I began to struggle as much as I could muster as an unknown member walked to my side with a syringe. I tried to scream but the mask over my face tightens. 

“I’m sorry Joseph. This part is the least fortunate. Rest assured, much like work, pain will set you free.” Then I was out. 

In the darkness, I was filled with nightmares. I was in the woods. I was running. Behind me was a pack of dogs. As I ran they continued getting closer. Every step I took, the hunt grew shorter. I could smell their breath and feel the drool dripping off of their jowls. As they pounced on me, I stared into the alpha's eyes. The view was familiar. The wolves did not rip me apart. Instead they chewed. They chewed and chewed as the alpha stared into my eyes. Those eyes. They were filled with so much sorrow. 

I woke up to a new sight. The lights were softer and the nurse was kinder. She offered me a glass of water and helped me sit up to drink it. When I needed the facilities, she was there to help me up. I threw back the blankets and let out a scream. Where my useless noodles of muscle and bone used to be were now two lumps of flesh I didn’t recognize that were pale in color and completed with dirty stitches. The fear that coursed through my blood was quickly rushed away when I noticed the pain. 

My legs burned with the heat of infection, but they hurt. I hadn’t felt my legs hurt in years. My toes moved. The nurse helped me to my feet and I stumbled to the restroom. I walked to the bathroom. He had done it. That mad man had cured my paralysis. If only he’d stopped there. 
The next days were filled with me relearning how to walk. Like a baby I stumbled along hand rails and then toddled my way across the room. Before I knew it, the accident had never happened. As my life force reinvigorated the cold chunks that had been fused at my thigh, I was returning to normal. The nights were filled with tears. Happy at first, and then painful. The doctors said I was building muscle, but something didn’t feel right. Call it intuition, but I would swear my body was rejecting my attempt to defy nature. 

After 3 weeks, I returned to my suite and prepared to leave. Victor met me in my room and seemed to be helping me pack. We talked of plans for the future and what to do with my new gift. I thanked him vigorously, leaving out the growing fear of what was to come. Then I collapsed. My forehead covered in sweat and my vision blurring, the infection had taken over. Mr. Straker ran to my side and began evaluating my condition. “This is okay. We’ve had this before. We can fix this.” Th escort arrives with a gurney and I am rushed back downstairs. This time through a different room. Every spare inch of this new corridor was covered in beds. People screamed. The faces almost seemed familiar but my pain kept me from drawing too many connections. Every single person writhed in their straps and begged for death. I noticed they too had the discolorations in assorted limbs. Had they done this before?

Back in the operating room, the attendants ran around in a flurry. Tables and coolers were rushed in. People scrubbed and swapped. I was attached to a monitor with an uneven beeping. Someone said something about failure. This was it. I wasn’t going to make it off of here. Then the darkness again. This time I awoke to another bright light. 

This light, not blinding, was welcoming. Soft, warm, but bright. As my eyes adjusted, I scanned the room for a familiar face. Victor was pacing in the corner. When we locked gazes he rushed to my side. “Ah, my boy. Guten Morgen. Welcome back. We feared we had almost lost you. Unfortunately, due to a slight oversight, you had contracted an infection that was overtaking your systems. Not to worry, we were able to clean you out.”

 I checked my legs and they remained unchanged. The pale skin remained attached by crude lines and a growing scar. I reached out to feel the inflated incision area when I noticed my hand was not my own. The shock caused me to jump. “Unfortunately it had spread and more of your blood had soured. We made the decision to fix that for you. Worry not, we would never dare lose our most valuable subject to date.”

Subject? I knew this place wasn’t a hospital, but why had I gone from guest to subject? The questions filled my head and made me dizzy. Straker broke me out of my stupor. 

“Unfortunately you are not out of the woods yet. We do have more operations scheduled for you, but first you must rest.” He pushed a syringe that I had not previously noticed into my IV and I was once again gone. 

What I assume was the next morning, I woke in a haze. This time my bedside was blessed with a light of hope. Holly was there holding my remaining hand and praying. I interrupted her and she wiped tears away from her eyes. “When I heard about the infection I was so worried. I thought we had lost you. I didn’t know if I could handle that again.” I gripped her hand tighter and felt a calm come over me. We talked for a few hours about this and that. For a moment I forgot where I was. This place couldn’t be that bad if someone like this was here. Her perfectly sculpted lips pressed against my forehead and she left the room. She was replaced by the escort who helped me out of bed and down the hall. We entered a conference room and Victor sat at the head of the table. 

“Young Joseph, I fear that I have failed to explain exactly what it is we do here. We are in the business of improving life. For years, I was told stories of the beauty of creation and all that god had bestowed life upon. It never felt complete. When I broke free from the clutches of my mother, I was welcomed in by my grandfather. He brought me here. I was not the only one that shared my beliefs. He, and many generations before him, had felt the same way. He brought me here to join the business of improving intelligent design.” Then a curtain opened to reveal an operating theatre. He stood and stared through it. I watched as a screaming woman was brought into the room, tied to a gurney. “We had tried everything. Selective breeding, genetic mutation, etc. Nothing we did could fix the insufficiency in his ultimate design. Then we discovered that the issue wasn’t in the production, but in the existence.” As I watched in horror the woman’s bed was raised and she was dumped into a vat of unknown fluid. As she wriggled and squirmed against her restraints, I caught her screams. The skin on her face began to boil and peel. Before long she began developing boils and blisters. As they popped, more and more of her muscle was exposed. When the muscle would blister it would expose bone. Before long, she had fully dissolved and was nothing but a biology class decoration.

 “Of course some are less keen to the advancement of the species.” He turned away from the glass and the curtain closed. “That is why we were so excited to hear of you. When we heard of your tragic accident, I realized where we had failed. Volunteers focused on vanity; you, dear Joseph, were focused on survival. Yes life had adapted to your situation, but why not relive life to the fullest? When you accepted our invitation, I began preparations.” 

He walked along the table to meet me and took me by the hand. Together we walked through the doors and into yet another sterile room. 

“We began sourcing the very best of specimens from our volunteer pool.” We had returned to the area that I was rushed through before. Now that I had time to pay attention, the place was horrifying. On all sides, people lay in various states of consciousness as others with power tools poked and prodded. The deafening screams were only beaten by the unholy smell that perforated every inch of this place. I watched as a man, fully conscious, writhed against the knife of a surgeon. In one hand he held the flap of skin, with the other he removed organ after organ. The man fought as much as he could but the orderlies and restraints made his efforts futile. Eventually the shock and blood loss sent him into the all too familiar darkness and the screaming stopped. 

Well, his did. It was immediately replaced with the symphony of pain that surrounded me. Limbs were removed, eyes were popped from their socket, teeth were extracted, all without an inkling of the kindness that was afforded to me via the mystery syringe. As I continue the trudge through the puddles of the volunteers, we entered the operating room that I remembered all too well. Victor guided me to the table and in my stupor I didn’t even fight. He laid me back and affixed my straps. This time I noticed that he also strapped my legs. 

“Now let’s get this settled once and for all.” 
I don’t know if I had angered Mr. Straker or if I was simply becoming too expensive, but this time he decided to forego the anesthetic. As I lay there facing the ceiling, I hear a saw blade spin up not inches from my head. The nurse straps a leather strap into my mouth to muffle the screams. As the blade makes contact with my forehead I try to scream. The restraints make it impossible to fight. This is it. As it pierces through and begins working against the bone, I feel someone else begin working on my abdomen. I can feel the scalpel ripping through my stomach and I’m reminded of the man on the table. With no other option I begin to cry. As I feel his hands gripping my liver I manage to shriek past the strap. Then I black out from the pain. 

I wake up in a dark room. There’s nothing. Just darkness and something tied to my leg. I move my hand down and feel the cold steel of a new restraint. I work my hand back up and find my hideous scar is now paired with stitches and wounds all over my mangled, reformed body. My mind is running a million miles an hour when I’m blinded by the lights. As I turn away, I hear a familiar voice. 

“Now this next specimen is one that we worked years on. After many attempts, this one seems to have worked.” I stand to face the man responsible for my condition and notice a trio. Mr. Straker, the escort, and a new man. I had never met this man but he felt so familiar, perhaps I was focused on the wheelchair that led him into my prison. I begin fighting my restraint and yelling out to him. “Get out of here. Save yourself. Tell the world. They’re evil.” But nothing came out. All I could do was groan and gurgle in my spit. It was then that I noticed the pain in my throat. As I reached forward and tried to fight through my busted voice box, he reached out to me. The escort grabbed his chair and wheeled him out. As the doors closed, all I could muster out was a broken and garbled “save.”

The best signal - because the signals will happen in the basement. Something ‘clear’ and ‘obvious’ (as Robin foreshadows to Will to look for) will happen in the basement. The strongest signal will come through.

‘Til it’s obvious.’

Will is a ‘signal receiver’, as Robin says.

He’s looking out for these signals in Mike (‘knock of a knee, bump of an elbow, a shared look’, these ‘snowballs’). 

They’ve mentioned the basement 3 times during the radio - 

‘Basement, you can get a good signal down there.’ 
‘Best signal in the basement.’ 
‘LOCK that basement or bedroom door…’

Something def is happening down there. Will is gonna get the clearest signal down there.

Stranger Things and the Duffers have created this station - and are encouraging fans to decode and look for Easter eggs  in the conversations in between songs. They’ve mentioned this basement over and over, as well as the ‘can of coke’ and ‘hot coffee’ Mike and Will drink is almost identical shots.

Look, romantic schedules and mood boards might feel inspiring for 10 minutes, but they don’t solve the real thing. Most people aren’t struggling because they don’t have enough cute calendars or planners. It’s deeper. It’s about *structure*, *strategy*, and *self-control* the legit trio that actually builds a stable, productive life. 

A lot of smart, capable people feel stuck, not because they’re lazy, but because there’s *too much noise* on how to improve. Some advice is aesthetic. Some is hustle porn. Very little is grounded in psychology, neuroscience, and behavior science. This post is for anyone who’s tired of half-truths from attention-seeking influencers. What’s worked long-term isn’t glamorous. But it’s effective. And learnable.

This is pulled from top books, lab research, and behavior design legends like James Clear, B.J. Fogg, and Cal Newport. Let’s break it down:

- **Structure = predictability for your brain**  
  Willpower is LIMITED. Decision fatigue is real. A study from the *National Academy of Sciences* showed parole judges were more likely to deny parole as their workday wore on. Why? Mental exhaustion. Structure isn’t rigid control, it’s liberation from micro-decisions. Use time blocks. Set default routines. Remove wiggle room.  
  → Morning = output  
  → Afternoon = admin  
  → Evening = recovery  
  You don’t need motivation if a system is already doing the heavy lifting.

- **Strategy = doing the right thing, not everything**  
  Most people are playing *whack-a-mole* with their lives. Reactive. Scattered. Strategy means knowing what matters and designing your life around that. The *Pareto Principle* (80/20 rule) isn’t just a business thing. In *The One Thing* by Gary Keller, he shows how success is built on narrowing your focus. Tiny daily work on the right domino tips everything else. Ask yourself: what’s the one habit that’ll make everything else easier? Start there. Not with five self-care routines and 12 apps.

- **Self-control = a skill, not a moral trait**  
  You don’t need more “discipline”. You need *better boundaries*. The Stanford marshmallow experiment? People thought kids who waited were just more disciplined. But it turned out they distracted themselves. They used stratgies. Same is true for adults. Dr. Roy Baumeister’s research on ego depletion shows that we burn out fast when constantly pushing back against temptation. The fix? Control the environment, not just yourself. Stack habits. Delete triggers. Cut choices. Make the good path frictionless.  
  → Want to read more? Place your book *on top* of your phone.  
  → Want to eat better? Remove all snacks from view. Simple. Boring. Powerful.

- **Bonus: Add friction where needed**  
  Want to stop doomscrolling? Log out of all your apps. Add a 5-minute lockout timer before you can open them. According to the *Behavioral Design Lab* at Stanford, adding friction breaks mindless loops. This changes the game more than a pep talk ever will.

- **Mimic military-style structure, but make it humane**  
  Navy SEALs train with strict routines not because they're robots, but because *structure conserves energy*. You aren’t a SEAL. But you can borrow the idea. Set sacred wake-up and sleep hours. Automate breakfast. Plan tomorrow before bed. Cal Newport calls this “deep work architecture” your external world shapes your internal clarity. 

- **Don't rely on motivation, rely on design**  
  B.J. Fogg’s *Tiny Habits* method proves small changes succeed more than big promises. Anchor habits to existing behavior. Want to learn a new language? Link flashcards to brushing teeth. Want to stretch daily? Do it right after your coffee brews. It starts to feel automatic.

Too many people think they “just lack willpower”. No. You lack *systems*. You don’t need a new personality. You need repeatable scaffolding.

It’s not sexy. It’s not viral. But this formula? It’s how high performers consistently win. Structure gives you stability. Strategy gives you direction. Self-control gives you leverage.

This is how you outlast trends and build a sustainable life.",2,1765144061.0,BuildingBetterMen,0,1.0,False

Sad. I was going to post this there as part of this series, but now it goes here instead because I thought others might enjoy a bit of Dragorean in their life.

This is for the language of dragons in the *[Pick-n-Mix Comix](https://archiveofourown.org/users/picknmixcomix)* universe, where they take and inspire bits of languages from the worlds and planets they visit. Usually, it's fairly similar in grammatical style and construction to English simply for coconvenience's sake, but words get compounded often (romanized with dashes in between them) and articles are placed as suffixes after the words they're aoplying to. Dragorean is usually written in a romanized style in-universe known as Akthorian Phonetic Standard, and also has an orthographic system called the Dragorean Diacritic Set, which uses 38 letters, diacritics, and digraph markers to present pronunciation-accurate spellings of various words; whether they're originally written in Mezhon runes, Tovoshok's *ksingirima* logographic system, or anything else.

But this post isn't about *ksingirima*, it's about *fej*. *Fej*, quite literally, is just coffee, and because the word itself is not descriptive and isn't a compound like ""bean-juice"" or ""brown stuff"" to tell you what it is, you'd need more words to describe what fej is to you, so I felt like using the opportunity to write a small set of paragraphs *in* Dragorean, like a dragon or *Dathzhad* (Dragorean's autonym) speaker, would be describing it to you.

First, in romanized Mezhon Dragorean, based on how Mezhon runes presented its words:

> *Fej zenul wanunen-wesai to-knarl. Knarl darlor zenul fod. Knarl darlor tam-sidditho zenul nav-skish tam-sidditho vadt tam-satum-kinazhi-ma. Suv naz hendak, fej zenul satum-zoj valik zenul kuteyraz tam-sidditho managi dath-ma, kuv managi zhu-ma tam-sidditho vadt.*

> *Fej selul meylo kuv bon suv nav-wisa ebu dath-wesai kuteyrul oj.*

> *Fej zenul bon.*

> *Dath-ma nav-skishul fej suv managi hendak-ma kuv kinazhi-ma.*

And again, in Dragorean Diacritics, which should hopefully be recognizable if you know the tones and such:

> *Fej zēnúl ƿánūnın-ƿēsæ tō-knárl. Knárl ðárlōr zēnúl fōð. Knárl ðárlōr tam-sıðēþō zēnúl náv-skış tam-sıðēþō vát tam-sŭtūm-kınážē-má. Sūv naz ‘ınðak, fej zēnúl sŭtūm-záj valık zēnúl kūtāraz tam-sıðēþō mŭnágē ðaþ-má, kūv mŭnágē žū-má tam-sıðēþō vát.*

> *Fej zēnúl bán.*

> *Ðaþ-má náv-skışúl fej sūv mŭnágē ‘ınðak-má kūv kınážē-má.*

IPA, to the best of my ability (I'm still adjusting the phonology I'd like to have as I get used to the mechanics of this language more familiarly):

> /fɛdʒ ziːnʋl wɒnuːnɪn-wiːsaɪ toʊ-knɒrl. knɒrl ðɒrloʊr ziːnʋl foʊð. knɒrl ðɒrloʊr tæm-sɪðiːθoʊ ziːnʋl nɒv-skɪʃ tæm-sɪðiːθoʊ vɒt tæm-sʌtuːm-kɪnɒʒiː-mɒ. suːv næz ħɪnðæk, fɛdʒ ziːnʋl sʌtuːm-zɒdʒ vɒlɪk ziːnʋl kuːteɪræz tæm-sɪðiːθoʊ mʌnɑɡiː ðæθ-mɒ, kuːv mʌnɑɡiː ʒuː-mɒ tæm-sɪðiːθoʊ vɒt./

Then, translation into English, as direct as possible:

Coffee can be food, in general. Coffee can also be liquid-which-you-can-drink (or ""a drink"", natch), as well, sometimes. In any case, coffee is something which can be consumed by many dragons and many people also.

I need some perspective on a recent incident with someone I considered developing a friendship with.

Back when I lived in Amman, I met this guy at several book clubs and literature events. We connected over our shared passion for reading, exchanged social media details, and kept in touch after I moved to Tafila for a new job opportunity. Over the last two years, we regularly liked each other's posts and chatted occasionally about books, keeping that intellectual spark alive. All our in-person interactions, though, were within those structured group events.

Recently, I was back in Amman for a few days to see friends and family. Eager to turn our online connection into a real friendship—and because I truly enjoy exploring local coffee shops—I reached out to him. I suggested we meet for coffee to catch up on our latest reads. He loved the idea.

He suggested an anime-themed café. I arrived on time, but he was 35 minutes late. I waited patiently. The café was quite upscale and fancy, which was fine, but a sign of things to come.
He ordered us coffee and desserts. When the bill arrived, it was around 15 JOD. I looked at him, expecting him to offer to split it, but his body language made it clear he expected me to pay. I rationalized it: I suggested the initial meetup, so maybe it was my treat. I gladly paid, thinking he'd cover the next round.

When we left, he asked if I had more time to hang out and grab food. Happy to extend what I thought was a burgeoning friendship, I agreed. He suggested a nearby restaurant, and we walked over. We ordered a substantial amount of food—we were both clearly hungry.
At this point, I fully expected us to split the bill, since he had suggested the extended activity.
To my shock, when the waiter came, he completely ignored the payment, forcing me to handle the entire check. I was stunned. We were out, chatting, and I was trying to process what felt like a blatant expectation for me to pay for everything.

But it didn't end there. He suggested we get dessert from yet another shop. Again, it was a fancy, expensive ice cream/dessert place. I truly thought, Okay, this must be it. He’s going to treat me to this expensive dessert as a compliment for not splitting the previous two bills.

Nope.

He pulled the same move, stepping away from the counter and leaving me to pay for the third consecutive, unexpected, and expensive item. I was genuinely shocked by his entitlement and lack of courtesy. I ended the day shortly after, telling him I had to leave.

I was upset in the moment, but the anger really set in over the next few days. This wasn't just about the money; it was about the presumption and the way he treated me. He's a polished-looking engineer with a respectable job, so I know this wasn't about financial hardship.

I became dry with him on social media and eventually removed him from my friends list. He never offered to pay, never mentioned inviting me next time, and never acknowledged that I paid for the entire day.

This behavior felt like a massive deal-breaker for me. Was I naive to pay for everything, or was his lack of contribution and basic courtesy completely out of line? What do you guys think?",1,1765143771.0,Jordanians,3,1.0,False

1pguh6m,https://i.redd.it/387f9g2xlu5g1.png,I watched Season 3 BEFORE Seasons 1 & 2. My theory on Part 18.,"(Disclaimer: English is not my native language, so I used translation tools to help structure my thoughts and analysis. But the theory and observations are entirely my own.)

I know, I committed the ultimate sin. I watched Season 3 first.  
But watching The Return without 25 years of nostalgia filters gave me a very different perspective. I wasn't waiting for ""my Coop"" to return to drink coffee. I was watching a metaphysical procedural about a calculated operation. After I finally went back and watched S1, S2, and FWWM, I became even more convinced: **Cooper didn't fail. He executed a Hard Reboot of the reality construct.**

Most theories suggest Cooper is a tragic figure who got lost in the timeline. I disagree. I believe he had 25 years in the Lodge to plan this perfectly.

There are no accidental scenes in Twin Peaks. Every shot has weight, even the soul of the boy hit by the truck. Here is my analysis connecting the dots that seem disconnected.

# 1. The ""Real"" Cooper is Safe (The Avatar Theory)

**The Observation:**  
In Part 17, we see Cooper’s giant, superimposed, semi-transparent face staring at the screen, saying, ""We live inside a dream."" Many think this is just meta-commentary. I think it is literal.

**The Theory:**  
The Cooper driving to Odessa (Richard) is not the ""Real"" Cooper. It is an avatar, a projection sent into the density of a specific dream-layer. The ""Real"" Cooper (The Dreamer) is operating from the Lodge or outside of time.

**The Evidence:**

* **The Transition was ""Too Smooth"":** Remember when Cooper first returned to the world as Dougie? It was traumatic. He lost all psychomotor functions, he was catatonic, and Mike (The One Armed Man) had to warn him, ""Don't die."" The transition from the Lodge to physical reality nearly killed him.
   * Compare that to Part 18. Cooper travels through multiple layers of Limbo (The Red Room -> Jeffries' Purgatory -> The Fireman’s coordinates -> The Electrical Tower). Yet, he walks into the new reality effortlessly. This implies he isn't entering a physical reality, but a mental one. He is entering a dream within the dream.
* **The Glitch with Diane:** Why is Diane waiting at Glastonbury Grove? She didn't follow him through the door. And look at the kiss at the 430 mile marker. It is mechanical, terrifying. *Throughout the story, a kiss was their way of verifying if the person in front of them was real*.
   * **The Tulpa Realization:** I believe at that moment, one or both of them realize they are Tulpas. The ""Real"" Cooper isn't smiling. Tulpas retain human traits, which explains Diane’s hesitation and the sadness in their eyes. They know they are fragments of themselves, sent on a suicide mission.
* **Psychological Torture:** The reality of Odessa is heavily manipulated by Judy (Jowday). It is designed to break the Avatar. This is not a ""Time travel"".
   * Immediately after crossing, Diane leaves him (isolation).
   * He loses his identity (becomes Richard).
   * The environment is aggressive (the fight at Judy's Diner happens almost instantly).
   * Laura doesn't know herself.
   * **The Name of the Workplace:** The most blatant sign of ownership is where Laura works: **Judy's Diner**. It is a sick cosmic joke. It sounds exactly like **""Judy's Dinner.""** Laura is trapped inside a place branded by her captor. She isn't just a waitress serving food; to the entity, **she is the food.** She is being kept on ice in ""Judy's Dinner"" to generate Garmonbozia (pain/sorrow) indefinitely. *This is one of the reasons why Cooper stopped exactly there.* He knew where he needed to go, as if tracking a signal, but it was the specific name that triggered him. This leads us to assume that the name - and the place itself - are not real. This explains why he didn't lower his weapon after neutralizing the gunmen, but instead kept scanning the room, aiming at ordinary bystanders. He understood he was in a different reality construct. Not fully knowing the laws of this place, he was prepared for the possibility that other patrons or staff might suddenly turn aggressive, viewing them all as potential threats.

# 2. The Woods: Not a Capture, but a ""Link""

**The Standard Theory:**  
Cooper tries to save Laura in 1989, but Judy ""snatches"" her away at the last second (the scream), and Cooper is left with an empty hand.

**My Counter-Argument:**  
If Judy won, why is she so angry?  
In the scene with Sarah Palmer (Judy's vessel), she smashes Laura's portrait in a blind rage. In the final episodes, we see the TV is off—her loop of boredom is broken. Judy is reacting to a threat.

**The Evidence:**

* **The Missing Corpse (Status Quo Shift):** The corpse disappearing from the beach is the smoking gun.
   * If Judy just wanted to kill her, the body would remain to anchor the sorrow of Twin Peaks.
   * The missing body proves Cooper successfully performed a **""Cut & Paste"" Extraction**.
* **Judy's Reaction:** Judy creates a ""morok"" (haze/confusion) and manipulates reality in the finale (the different owners of the Palmer house) because she is losing control. She is scrambling to hide the package Cooper stole.
* **The Scream in the Woods:** This wasn't a scream of terror. It was the sound of the **Link** being established. Cooper didn't ""lose"" her; he tagged her signal so he could find her later in the buffer zone (Odessa).

# 3. Judy and the ""Rules of Evil"" (Balance & Permission)

**The Observation:**  
Throughout the season, we see that Evil cannot just do whatever it wants. It is bound by strict rules.

**The Theory:**  
Judy is a ""Watchdog,"" a jailer of this reality, but she requires permission to act.

**The Evidence:**

* **The Nuclear Test:** Evil only entered (The Frog-Moth/Bob) after humanity opened the door with the Trinity test. The Light exists (we see the golden soul of the boy rising), but it is passive. Evil fills the void humanity creates.
* **The Vampire Logic:** Just as vampires cannot enter without invitation and dark spirits cannot take souls without permisison, Judy/Sarah doesn't attack the trucker first. She waits to be provoked. She is bound by the rules of the game.
* **The Awakening:** Laura is the Avatar of sleeping Light (The Golden Orb). We cannot comprehend what happens when she wakes up because our minds (and the characters' minds) are trapped in the current balance of the world. But Cooper, who has ascended beyond the Lodge, understands.

# 4. Odessa is a Deeper Circle of Hell

**The Theory:**  
Odessa isn't time travel or a parallel universe. It is a deeper plane of Limbo, likely constructed by Judy herself.

**The Environment:**  
Previously, Cooper was navigating the upper layers of the Lodge. In Part 18, he descends into the basement.

* It looks like our world (""The Real World""), but it feels wrong. *We no longer hear music on the road, or any score at all. We lose the atmosphere and immersion; instead, we are left with a sense of total hollowness.* There is a theological concept that **""The deepest circles of Hell are indistinguishable from a cold, uncaring reality.""**
* It is a ""Thought without Volume."" A flat, grey simulation meant to keep the Golden Orb (Laura) asleep as ""Carrie Page.""
* Cooper enters this specific plane because it is the only way to reach the buried consciousness of Laura.

# 5. The Ending: A ""Hard Reboot""

**The Concept:**  
Cooper and Laura in the car are not physical bodies. They are **Letters** being delivered to a destination. They are thoughts on the edge of dissolving.

**The Climax:**  
Cooper asks, ""What year is this?""  
He is inputting the ""Kill Code"" to the simulation. He brings Laura to the singular point of trauma (The House) to trigger the memory.

**The Scream:**  
For modern gamers, think of Laura as **Dame Aylin (The Nightsong)** from Baldur's Gate 3. A trapped celestial being whose pain fuels the villain. You cannot kill the villain until you free the battery.  
Laura isn't screaming in fear. She is **Remembering**. The ""Carrie Page"" mask shatters. The Light creates a feedback loop.  
**The lights go out not because the story ends in darkness, but because the server crashed.** The dream of suffering ended.

# Conclusion

Cooper didn't spend 25 years in the Lodge doing nothing. There is a reason why Major Briggs and Gordon Cole treated Cooper as a legend. They trusted him because he was capable of thinking far beyond the boundaries of the reality they existed in. Cooper knew exactly what he was doing the entire time. The confident, consistent way he moves forward without explaining anything to anyone proves he has a specific plan. He is trying to awaken Laura - literally waking up the Light from a passive state of non-interference. It mirrors exactly how Mike tried to wake Cooper up while he was trapped as ""Dougie."" Cooper might not know exactly where the ""Real"" Laura is located; his goal was to find a connection point to send a wake-up signal. Perhaps the Laura in Odessa is also just a thought-form or an avatar, but her presence there is the thread that leads to the true Laura, wherever she is hidden.  
We are literally told throughout the series that this is a 'story about one girl,' that Laura is the one who must be saved. The show constantly broadcasts that the answer lies in dreams, that connections are established within dreams, and we see over and over again that dreams reveal the truth to the characters. The Lodge (Limbo) itself is the dimension of the dream.

1. Cooper **extracted** Laura from 1989 (erasing the corpse).
2. He **hid** her in a deep dream layer (Odessa) where she couldn't be destroyed.
3. He **sent an avatar** (Richard) to retrieve her.
4. He **triggered the awakening** using the link established in the woods.

The ending is a ""Mission Accomplished."" We don't see the aftermath because the reality we were watching ceased to exist.",2,1765143721.0,twinpeaks,0,0.67,False

1pgugbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1pgugbx/psa_advice_on_investing/,PSA: Advice on Investing,"I have seen many post asking the best way to gain money by investing. They want something fast and with great returns. It appears that these people believe there is a secret recipe that others can share. So I thought about sharing some basic info that will hopefully help you make educated decision based on your specific circumstances:

1. Short term investment is speculation. Think of it as betting in a casino. You can win big but you can also lose it all. Do not invest what you cannot afford to lose. There is no magic formula. Run away from the people who tell you there is. 

2. With the safe options, you cannot expect meaningful gains unless you have invested a significant amount of money. HYSA and CDs offer approx 4% a year. So you need to deposit $100,000 to make $4,000 after a whole a year ($3,000 after taxes).  

3. You best investment is a retirement account with an index fund. It is not trendy or sexy but it is your best option for gaining wealth in the long term. If you put $100 in your 20s, by the time you retire, that would become $1,700. If you put $100 every month, by the time you retire you will have half a million dollars.

4. Whether you are investing in the short or long term, please understand that most people do not have enough knowledge to pick the right stocks and do not know when to buy or sell. Do you read companies' quarterly reports, weather forecasts, international politics news, and scientific journals to be able to predict if Costco will buy coffee beans from Brazil at a good price? No you don't.

5. My advice: If your employer matches your retirement contributions, put at least the matching amount. It is free money. Think of your contribution as any other bill that must be paid every month, not like somethin optional. If possible, it should be deducted from your pay check so you don't even see it. Your future self will thank you.

Looking for ways to grow local traffic and repeat attendance.,"Hi everyone. I am building a small in person creative experience in a major metro city, and I could really use some guidance from people who have worked in marketing for local events or experiential brands. I have been living inside this project for a while now, so I am probably too close to see what actually matters and what does not.

***The idea is simple.*** Think paint and sip, but instead of painting, people build their own terrariums while having coffee, wine, or beer in a relaxed space. They get something to take home, the mood is social without being loud, and it works well for date nights or small groups of friends who want something different.

Based on the planning work I have done, people ages 24 to 39 in large cities are already spending heavily on creative and social experiences.



# Who I think I am trying to reach

* Young professionals and creatives in active, culture focused neighborhoods
* Mostly ages 24 to 39, usually attending in pairs or small groups
* People who want hands on, low pressure activities that feel aesthetic and social
* A customer base that is open to coming back if the events feel fresh

This matches the audience insights in my planning files. Customers in this group are usually comfortable paying 40 to 70 dollars for curated creative activities.



# Where things currently stand

* I have a wait list landing page set up.
* I have early social content starting to go up
* I am exploring possible partnership pathways with venues, creators, and nearby businesses
* I am actively working on this, but I still need help shaping a clear brand identity and figuring out the right processes and channels to focus on in the early stages
* I also set up a basic kit system so the events run smoothly during launch

Right now the challenge is not effort. I am doing the work. I just need guidance on how to focus it and how to build a foundation that can grow with time.



# What I would love advice on

1. For an experience like this, which channels actually drive early ticket sales in a major metro city
2. How you would structure the first 45 days of marketing before launch
3. Whether it makes sense to hold off on introducing theme variations until the base event is proven
4. How to create real social proof when you have no reviews yet
5. If you have grown a recurring in person event, what made people return
6. If you saw this plan on your desk, where would you focus and what would you ignore for now
7. Whether there are additional channels or approaches I should be thinking about, especially involving partnerships or community based distribution



# Why I am asking

I have a solid operational plan. I have audience insights. I am exploring possible partnership pathways. What I need now is real world perspective from marketers who have built traction for a local experiential brand in a competitive metro environment. If you can share anything you have learned, I would truly appreciate it.



**TLDR:**  
I am launching a terrarium plus coffee or wine creative workshop in a major metro city. I have a waitlist, venues, and about 45 days until launch. I am looking for insight on which marketing channels and tactics actually matter for early demand, social proof, and repeat attendance.",1,1765143360.0,AskMarketing,1,1.0,False

1pgubre,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pgubre/death_is_a_never_ending_fever_dream/,Death is a Never Ending Fever Dream,"	Adam awoke with a start. He looked down at his body, pulling the covers up. He was drenched in sweat. Adam groaned and got out of bed, holding his head in his hands. He had been having nightmares for the past few days; all of the same situation. He would fall asleep next to his wife Karina and then appear in a damp and cold room. It had wooden flooring that was obviously old and rotting. The walls were a dark green wallpaper that peeled at certain places. Adam would then open the dark brown door into the rest of the house.

	Adam is then greeted by a long hallway with the same flooring and wallpaper. Cobwebs covered every surface and the floorboards would creak and groan with each step, bending under his weight. As Adamn would walk down the hallway he would eventually see a bright white door that did not match the dilapidated surroundings. As soon as he would spot the door that seemed miles away he would turn around to see the presence of a ghastly figure. 

It wore a dark cloak that was torn to shreds. Its face, hidden in shadow. The figure would lift up its arm and point at Adam. Its hand was made of pure bone. It was slightly levitating off of the ground, however it casted no shadows. Adam would begin to run towards the door, to safety from this mysterious figure. He did not even want to find out if it was a friend or foe. 

The figure would begin chasing him at a steady pace. Adam would run as fast as he could but the door would grow farther and farther away. Eventually the figure would catch up to Adam and grab his shoulder or any part of his body it could reach. Adam would then wake up drenched in sweat and still shaking from his fear.

Adam stands up after processing his dream and letting the fear slowly drift away. He looks over to his wife Karina. They had been married for 7 years. They had no children. 2 years ago they had both been in a car accident which left Adam with several fractures and permanent back pain. Karina, however, was hurt the worst. She had lost the child she was carrying. Her body was permanently damaged from the loss and the physical trauma to her body from the accident. The doctor told them that she may never be able to have children again. They were devastated. Karina had only been 3 months pregnant. They hadn't even found out the gender or picked out a proper name.
Karina became a different person after the accident which Adam didn't blame her for. She rarely left the house. Sometimes she would go days without even looking at Adam.

“Its just painful to look at you sometimes,” she would say.

“I just remember that you were almost a father and I can't help but feel guilty that I can't make that a reality anymore. Sometimes I'll look at you and imagine what you would be like playing with our child. It just hurts sometimes to be reminded.”

Hearing her say that hurt Adam so deeply. He understood where she was coming from however. He would sometimes look at her and think about what could have been. He doesn't blame her for the accident or for losing the baby of course but sometimes it just hurts.


Adam walked into the kitchen and began making his coffee for the day. After finishing his coffee and watching a segment of the news. It seemed like today was going to be like the past few. Karina had been ignoring Adam once again. He decided to give her some space and try not to bother her. He assumed she was just upset about the past. Adam walked back to their shared bedroom but he heard Karina silent sobs. She would lock herself in their room occasionally and asked to be left alone. He walked back into the living room not wanting to make her more upset.

	Adam was off from work today and he decided it was a good opportunity to take a nap on the couch. He slowly drifted off to sleep. He opened his eyes to see the same green walks and brown door. He sighed, getting tired of having this same dream every time he closed his eyes. He opened the door once again and began a brisk pace towards the white door he knew would be up ahead. As it came into view he felt the presence of the figure behind him. This time he decided to try something different. 

“Who are you!?” Adam yelled at the figure. “What is this place and what do you want with me!?”. Adam continued hurling questions at the man only to be given no reaction. The figure stayed still however. Usually it would be chasing Adam by now. The two stared at each other before the figure spoke.

“Remember…” It whispered in a raspy voice.

“Rememebr what?’ Adam stared.

The figure then rushed towards Adam and before he could even react he awoke and fell off of the couch. As he regained his bearings he saw that it was now dark outside.

“What the hell? It was just 11am!?” Adam spoke aloud and glanced at his phone showing 7:23pm. 

Adam stood up and recalled what the figure had said to him. “Remember…” His head hurt. A throbbing pain in the back of his head. He stood up and brushed off his knees. He walked into the shared bedroom and saw Karina was asleep curled up on the floor holding one of his shirts. He smiled at her sleeping form and carefully picked her up. He placed her on the bed and tucked her under the covers. He kissed her forehead and whispered “Goodnight.” 

Adam walked into the bathrooms and finally took the shower he desperately needed after waking up twice covered in sweat. Afterwards, he changed his clothes and stayed up all night watching tv. He was terrified he would fall asleep. 

Adam never once closed his eyes that night. Once the sun came up he decided to get up and get ready for work. He called out a “Goodbye Honey! Love you!” to his wife before he left. She never came out of their bedroom. Once Adam got to work he parked his car. Strangely when he walked up to the automatic doors they didnt op[en for him.

“Huh? Weird.” Adam waved his hands at the sensor but nothing helped. He ended up having to wait for someone else to walk by and open the doors. He slipped inside giving a “Thanks I don't know why it wasn't working for me.” to the man that opened the door. However the man just ignored him. Adam scoffed and continued to his office space. He sat down and began his usual work day. 

His boss, Richard nor any of his coworkers seemed to acknowledge his presence. Adam thought maybe they were stressed or busy. He honestly didn't mind that much. At the end of the day he pushed out and walked again to the doors. They remained closed. Adam just sighed and walked to the other exit door that he could push open. 

He made his way home but when he parked he saw that his wife was closing the door coming out of the house. She was dressed in all black and tears were streaming down her face.

“Honey what happened? Are you ok?” Adam approached slowly and held his wife in his arms. 

Karina ignored him and kept walking towards her car. No matter how many times Adam called out to her she never even looked at him. Adam began to get frustrated. She had had her moments wanting peace but this seemed excessive. Maybe she was angry at him? He didn't know what he would have done to upset her. He watched Karina drive away before approaching a bush of flowers. He picked a few flowers and headed inside. He filled a vase of water and placed the flowers inside and set it on the kitchen table. Hopefully she'll love them.

2 days passed. Karina was still treating Adam the same. It seemed as if he had gone invisible. The nightmares that plagued him were no help. Adam just got home from another day at the office to be greeted with the sight of his wife asleep on the couch. She was holding something. Adam stepped closer and saw it was a long and thin laminated piece of paper with flowering decals and a large picture with words underneath. As Adam knelt down to read what it said he froze. 

He stared. He couldn't move. Cold washed over his body drawing him in an Antarctic sea of fear and dread. On the paper was a picture of him and underneath the words. “Adam Macormick 1981-2025. A beloved husband, son, and friend.” Adam’s world collapsed around him. He read and re-read those words over and over again. He wasn't being ignored. He wasn't magically invisible. He was dead. 

	“No…no no no no. This.. This can't be happening. This doesn't make sense! What happened!? This isn't real. I have to be dreaming.” Adam felt a cold wet tear run down his cheek. This explained everything. Karina, his poor wife, lost 2 people she cared for so deeply. How could he do this to her? On the Obituary it stated that Adam was killed in a hit and run accident. The irony was disgusting. He and his child were both killed in the same way. 

	Adam sat on the opposing sofa of his wife and just stared at her and the paper in his hands. His nightmares started the day after he died. He didn't even remember the day it happened. That figure was death itself. Chasing Adam down each night getting closer and closer. It all made sense. Suddenly tears and cries of pain erupted from Adam. He couldn't stop himself. It hurt so much to know that he was leaving behind so much. So many opportunities he'll never get to even try to achieve. The family he will never be able to start. He had so much to live for. 

	Adam sat in silence until he felt something cold in the hallway. He remembered the feeling but this time he wasn't dreaming. Adam stood up and began walking toward the hallway that led to his front door. The bright white front door. The green wallpaper and brown wooden flooring staring back at him. The wood creaked with each doorstep. Then he saw it. The figure. 

	The figure, or death itself stared, not moving. Adam stared back. “I know.” is all Adam said to it. Death slowly glided towards him but Adam did not move an inch. Death lifted its boney arm and gently placed its hand on Adam's shoulder. It was comforting. It then pointed at his wife and Adam understood. 

	“Goodbye Honey…I love you so much. Fuck I’m so sorry. I'm sorry I did this to you.” Adam wiped away his tears and shakingly kissed the top of his wife's head. She stirred at the contact and mumbled in her sleep. “I miss you.” 

Adam stood up caressing her face one last time. “I'll wait for you.""

Adam walked slowly towards Death. Hand in hand and stepped through. ",1,1765143345.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,0,1.0,False

Relevant Medical Conditions: CRPS 16 years, started after a breast reduction and then spread and became full body.

Type 2 Diabetic. Though outside of flare ups, blood sugars are good and A1C is within range.

Main Concerns: Ongoing abdominal/GI symptoms, major weight loss, recurrent ketones, abnormal labs, rapid emptying of stomach, worsening overall health with no diagnosis.

Hi doctors,

I’m hoping for guidance or ideas to bring to my medical team. I’ve been dealing with ongoing acute abdominal and systemic symptoms since March, with repeated hospital visits, hospitalizations and testing but still no clear answers. My health has been declining rapidly and I’m desperate for direction while I continue working with specialists. 

Flares last anywhere from a day to two, to several days, this most recent one started 11/25 off and on (mostly on) up until yesterday, so 11 days. The flare before that (Oct) lasted 2 days and on day 2 I was hospitalized for 4 days on the acute care floor. After a flare is over, it takes me days/weeks to ""bounce back."" My muscles feel really weak afterwards and I have zero energy. 

I have been to the emergency room 7 times and released same day after being given pain meds, iv fluids, and nausea meds. I have been hospitalized overnight 3 times. In Oct I was hospitalized for 4 days. I have probably had at least 15 flares in total, but some of those I just rode out at home because just the idea of getting to the hospital seemed like climbing Mt Everest.

I feel like while my pcp is doing her best, there doesn't seem to be a lot of urgency to try and figure this out. But until then, I am genuinely afraid that I am going to die, there is a constant feeling of impending doom that will not go away. I worry that the stress my body is under during these flares is what is going to kill me.


Timeline & Major Symptoms (since March 2025):

- Unintentional weight loss > 50 lbs. started around 180 in March and am around 130 now (don't have an accurate scale)


- Severe abdominal pain (lower right), sharp/hot/stabbing


- Frequently starts while I’m asleep and wakes me gasping in pain. Very rarely do they start when I am awake


- Flares vary. Sometimes they last a day, sometimes a week, sometimes months apart between flares.


- The stomach pain is like nothing I've ever experienced. It is concentrated in my lower right abdomen (sharp,stabbing,hot), but it affects my whole body. I have trouble trying to explain it, but when I'm in a flare up the pain is so bad that I can barely think, struggle to speak, and can't even look at my phone/tv anything. I also have a ""buzzing"" feeling throughout my entire body. I end up spending hours/days laying in a dark room trying to be as still as possible.


- The vomiting during a flare is massive compared to the input. There is usually a mix of blood (dark red, but not coffee grounds), bile, and what appears to be mucus. If I take 2 small sips of water during a flare, cups of vomit come back up. Afterwards my throat feels like I swallowed a box of razor blades for days afterwards.

-Recurrent nausea + vomiting day to day 

-Poor appetite (near zero) I  go days without eating simply because I’m not hungry and it doesn't occur to me to eat. My most favorite foods in the world turn my stomach, I do try and consume a protein drink at least once a day and drink as much water and Gatorade or other electrolyte drinks as possible throughout the day.


- Elevated glucose, low CO2, high anion gap during episodes despite having nothing to eat and barely being able to drink.

-Weakness, dizziness/vertigo, shaking

- Intense sweating episodes, it literally looks like I just took a shower. Despite sweating, I am absolutely freezing. The sweat has a sickly almost sweet smell to it and it leaves a residue on my skin.

-Major GI symptoms with no clear pattern 

- Extremely Low potassium following flares

- Fatigue and overall physical decline

- No menstrual cycle > 6 months (probably weight/stress related but thought I should mention it anyways)

⸻

Imaging & Findings so far:

(None of these have been identified as the cause of flares)

• Bilateral ovarian cysts
• Fat-containing periumbilical hernia
• Diffuse esophageal wall thickening
• Possible CRPS involvement in GI tract (mentioned by one doctor)
• Gastric emptying study (Aug): rapid emptying — completed in 3 hrs instead of 6
• Multiple CT scans normal, Abdominal Ultrasound was normal, Xrays normals
• Labs/bloodwork/stool tests repeatedly “normal” outside abnormal labs during flares

What has been ruled out:
. Gastroparesis
.Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome

Scheduled/Upcoming Testing:

• Colonoscopy + Endoscopy January 12
• Possibly pill-cam depending on results

Family History:
Mom has Crohn's disease

Current Medications:

• Meloxicam 7.5 mg
• Ondansetron HCl 4 mg
• Clonidine HCl 0.1 mg
• Dicyclomine 10 mg
• Sucralfate 1 g
• Mirtazapine 15 mg
• Gabapentin 800 mg
. kratom as needed for pain (episodes started well before kratom use)
. Medical cannabis (episodes started well before cannabis use)

⸻

My question(s):
Given the symptoms + rapid gastric emptying + glucose abnormalities, weight loss, and abdominal pain, what conditions, tests, or specialists should I ask about next? Are there possibilities my team may be overlooking (GI, endocrine, metabolic, autoimmune, autonomic dysfunction, CRPS-related GI issues, etc.)?

Even a direction to investigate would help. I’m not looking for a diagnosis just hoping for insight, things to rule out, or questions to bring to my doctors while I wait for scopes.

By Tom Kropp

 

She stepped in front of me blocking my path. I could see that the red-haired, hot hooker was bad news. Obeying instinct, I tried sidestepping her.

“Hold on Kole. We need to talk. Look in my eyes!” she demanded.

A primal part of me assumed she probably had a pimp hiding in the alley to clobber and rob drunks like me. I averted my eyes and hopped a couple steps away from the bar alley. She blurred in my path supernaturally swift and only then did I take in all the details.        

She was taller than me with ravishing long red hair spilling down to her busty bosom, which was clad in a black bra open to display her impressive cleavage. Her legs were long below a dark miniskirt. Oddly she wore combat boots instead of high heels.

 “Look at me!” She demanded again. My eyes rose to meet hers. They were a bewitching blue that sucked me in hypnotically. Even more horrifying was how her hair seemed to rear up on its own and those scarlet silken tresses seemed to be snakes slithering and coiling around her head like a horrible halo of vipers. I managed to break free of her gaze and stumbled aside.

As though frustrated, she aimed a karate chop at my throat, which I blocked with my forearm. But the awesome impact sent me sprawling with my left arm numb from the force absorbed. I rolled up ready as the feisty female launched herself at me with fingers extended like claws. My side thrust kick caught her in the chest with bone breaking force. It bounced her back a brief instant before she lunged again, snarling, and revealing vampire fangs in her face. My second

side thrust kick caught her under her chin, snapping her head savagely back with a loud crack. Somehow she still battered me down with an arm like a lashing club. I rolled with the blow. She blurred phenomenally fast to snatch my shoulders and nip my neck. She was incredibly strong and cold as ice to touch. I drove my thumb in her eye and she screamed with a slap that sent me spinning, reeling, and fleeing from the monster.

Someone else slammed into me, bringing us both down into some garbage cans that tangled us up. It was a lean, mean-looking man that flashed fangs as his talons tore into my arm. My hand touched a bottle beside me and I bludgeoned his head with it. Glass smashed into shards that slashed gashes in his face. His features became a red ruin, blinding him briefly. I snap kicked him back by stomping his stomach and bolted away. I only made it block before my legs folded under me. I was losing blood from where she nipped my neck.

A truck pulled up, driven by a short and slim little lady with long dark hair and big brown eyes studying me with concern.

“I need a hospital.” I muttered.

She propped me up with surprising strength. “I’ll drive you to the hospital.” She assured me.

Then I blacked out.

\*\*\*

I woke up sometime later. I was a passenger in a little lady’s truck. My tongue touched fangs. My eyesight ignited the night like daylight. My hearing was supersonic and sense of smell

supernaturally sharp. I glanced at her.

“The vamp lady that bit you is named Medusa. You died from that bite. I gave you my blood to bring you back as a vampire. My name is Camilla. Medusa is my enemy. We might not escape her troupe. She believes that you can lead her to a reincarnated witch named Tempest. Soon Tempest will turn 18 and she will regain her past life’s memories and magic. In her past life Tempest created a sunlight spell allowing vampires to walk in daylight. No one’s ever been able to duplicate that spell. Books of prophesy predict Tempest conjuring that spell and vampires overrunning the world. I want to find Tempest first and help her escape from Medusa. The prophecy says a man of coal will find her and become her companion. Your name is Kole. It says she will turn 18 near here on Milwaukee’s south side. I have a magic scrying crystal that will detect her at close range. I need your help. I can also help you.”

It was all mind blowing.

I’d always liked books and movies about vampires. I even thought they might exist. Now I was one.

I was 38 and had survived a very violent life. I’ve been in a lot of street fights and bar brawls and cage fights during my years in jails and prisons on numerous different occasions. I was also in a biker gang for years. In my 30s, I went straight and became a mixed martial arts fighter racking up numerous wins headed for a near future shot at the heavyweight title. Then one night I was in a barroom brawl with a big dude that lost and he pressed charges on me with his buddy for a witness. I’d just done three years in prison for aggravated battery and now I had this new drama

descend upon me.

“I know this is a lot to take in.” Camilla assured me. “But if you stick with me tonight I can answer all your questions and give you some important info you need to be a vampire. Then, if you still want to go on your own, it’s okay. But for now Medusa can sense you many miles away because she’s tasted and touched your blood and sorcery connects you two.”

She pulled a pistol and knife from her seat and dropped them in my lap. “Here. If Medusa, and her troupe catch us remember that to kill a vamp, you must bisect their brain or be- head them. You must end the brains connection.”

I was struggling to understand everything as I pocketed the pistol and knife.

A bigger truck plowed into us. Our truck flipped from the road down into the swampy marsh. I was thrown clear. I spotted several vehicles stopping with vamps getting out. I ran away into the trees.

I felt my foes coming on my trail.

I leapt into the marsh waters up to my chest and crouched eyes deep. A male vamp vaulted in. I fired into his face at close range. The 44 bullet blew brains, blood and bone all over. Then two males tackled me like we were playing marsh football. My gun was gone and steel speared through my side as a blade impaled me. I seized the stabber’s wrist with a jujitsu twist that gave me his knife, which I swiped through his throat. I spun and a gun exploded near my ear. Hot lead seared my head grazing by. My knife slice shish kabobbed his skull. I jabbed a stab into my final foe’s forehead and that slew him. The marsh waters steamed as the dead vamps ignited the night with

bright hellfire that cremated them.

Suddenly I could see through Camilla’s eyes. Her Kevlar vest blocked her body from the barrage of bullets and buckshot. Magically she made a telekinetic shield over her skull that stopped several shots. She chucked a grenade that bombarded the enemy bodies with concussion force as shrapnel shredded flesh and shattered bone. Camilla stole one of their trucks and raced away. I couldn’t withstand her telepathic command. I ran to her mental beacon and found my speed to be a blur to anyone watching. A minute later I was beside her in the truck

“I thought you were dead.” I said.                                                                                             

“Close. I showed you what I saw.” She replied.

“I slew three after me.” I muttered.

“Medusa lives. She’ll hook up with reinforcements. We have little time.” Camilla explained.

I need to get you at least 30 miles from her for 24 hours so the magic of her bite on you dissipates. Then she can’t track you anymore. We’ll go north.”

“Why do my bad wounds feel like dull aches?” I wondered.

“Our vamp magic dulls pain while our flesh and bones regenerate and shove out foreign matter like bullets. But the process drains our strength and energy. We’re going to feel very tired, very soon. “She explained.

“You told me that you want to keep Tempest from helping Medusa weave a magic spell that will allow her chosen vamps to walk in sunlight. Wouldn’t you like to walk in daylight?”

“No.” She shook her head. “That’s a power no vamp should have. The only thing keeping

vamps from running the world is sunlight, which kills us and our magic. Change that and the human race will become compelled cattle to be slaves and food. I still care for many humans on this Earth.”

I frowned, then complained.

“You want me to find a reincarnated, 17 year old witch that doesn’t remember her past life or magic. You don’t have a name or description. All you have is a scrying crystal that should detect her astral soul within about 50 yards. You’re not giving me much to work with here.”

“Correct. What’s your hunting plan?” She demanded.

“If she’s any kind of normal 17-year-old girl the major scene for teens and twenty-somethings living on the south side is the weekend raves. I know the warehouses where they happen. One’s going on tomorrow night. We’ll start there. If that fails I’ve got other ideas.”

“Good,” she nodded.

“I didn’t like the way you were in my head controlling me. It felt like mental rape”. I said grimly.

“I’m sorry. I won’t make it a habit.” She promised.

I hate being controlled by anyone. I didn’t expect our partnership to last long.

“Another thing, that Medusa monster back there seemed to have snakes slithering through her hair and her gaze froze me in place. I barely broke free of her stare. I heard old myths about a Medusa monster. Is that her?”

“The real Medusa was slain long ago, but that’s one of her granddaughters. You were very lucky to survive.”

\*\*\*\*

   “If we don’t locate her at the rave tomorrow, where would you look next?” Camilla questioned.

“Why not have a normal human walk through the high schools during daylight with the crystal?” I suggested.

  “We already tried that.” She admitted.

I thought for a long while before suggesting, “Teens are slaves to social media. We can send e-mails to all the students enrolled in the south side schools advertising a free non-alcohol rave. We rent dance halls or skating arenas. If money isn’t an issue we throw several south side big bashes for students and she’ll show up.” I was thinking as quick as I could, feeling pressure to do so, likely as a result of Camilla’s hold on my mind.

   “Even if she has left school, I’m sure she knows students as friends that will tell her.” I argued.

  “What if she’s a drug addict or alcoholic hooker?” She asked.

  “Then we spend money in a bunch of drug houses and bars I know that have a lot of young girls on the scene. With enough money to do stuff we’ll find her.” I reasoned.

   “Moneys not an issue,” she assured me.

   “Why was I picked for this?” I had to ask.

   “Medusa picked you while I was watching for her. The fact that she picked you and you fought free of her made you valuable to me.” She confessed.

   “If she had fed me her blood and wrapped a sorcery collar around my neck, is there any way I could have escaped or killed her?” I wanted to know.

   “The infection and collar magic would have made your mind an open book to her. Your odds would have been slim.” She said.

   “If Tempest becomes so powerful after her birthday, won’t she take out Medusa despite the collar?” I queried.

   “Possibly. Medusa spell charmed the collar with her hair from Tempest’s former body. Like I did to make the channeling crystal to find her. The collars designed to ricochet magic back at her if she tries to harm Medusa. The more magic Tempest exerts against Medusa, the more sorcery would blowback on her.” She explained.

   “Why is Medusa your enemy?”

   “She’s evil and we have a long history that I don’t want to go into now. You were impressive fighting, but Medusa and her team hesitated briefly before using lethal force. They planned to take you hurt, but alive. Very few men can withstand the hypnotism of her gaze.

“Their surprise and hesitation gave us an edge. But next time they’ll be out to kill. At close range a knife beats a gun often. Within 30 feet vamps are a blur and the heads a tough target. Body shots will slow them down. But you’d be wise to learn how to use a knife in one hand and a pistol in the other.”

  ‘’I thought Medusa turned men to stone with her gaze?”

“This Medusa is the great granddaughter of the original Medusa. Her gaze doesn’t turn men to stone, it just makes them seize up helplessly still in frozen fear. You’re obviously very strong to have withstood her gaze.”

  “Do vampires often attack each other?”

  “Some do. The blood of another vamp provides the most delicious and euphoric high, better than humans even. There is also magic in our blood that can be used for spells. So witches, warlocks, werewolves, and other supernatural species prey on us.”

  “Do broken bones take longer to heal?”

  “Remember that your strength and your speed is now about seven times enhanced. The more hurt you are, then the longer it takes to heal. But few injuries last longer than a day of sleep healing

Repair. Silver bullets and blades do us more harm than lead or steel. It’s the same with werewolves.”

  “So most species we face can be killed by bisecting the brain or taking off the head?”

  “Yes. The brain is always the lethal point.” She nodded.

“How did you create the magic shield to block those head shots back there?” I had glimpsed an energy halo around her head.

   “I’ve been a vampire since I turned 18 during the Civil War in 1863. I’ve learned a lot of magic since then.” She shrugged.

  “On TV and movies the vamps all seem to stay in high school to date underage kids. Does becoming a vamp make people pedophiles?”

  Camilla laughed very sweetly. “No. That’s just a bunch of bull Hollywood made up to get the interest of underage girls. No one wants to stay in high school. And something tells me if Tempest is still in school she’s not happy with it.”

\*\*\*\*

  Tempest the witch reincarnated was actually a girl named Ash. Ash woke up to her alarm blaring. She shuddered with a groan. Her mom and her latest boyfriend had come home from the bar in the middle of the night engaged in a huge shouting match and scuffle. But that was par for the course in her life. She wondered how long her mom’s newest man would last. Her mom was a hard-core alcoholic. She collected payments from a long-term lawsuit fund. The monthly payments weren’t

huge, but it was enough to pay the bills and keep her from being forced to work a job. Her mom Kathy used her free time to drink and had done so for the past 10 years since the settlement. Kathy suffered from a replaced artificial hip and damaged disks in her back. The doctors had her on pain killers that she like to mix with alcohol. She’d been on a downward spiral for years. She already had liver damage and constantly coughed from all the cigarettes she smoked.

Ash’s father had left her mom eight years ago. Two years of her antics had been two too many for him. He’d moved out of state and remarried. He faithfully paid child support. But Ash could rarely reach him by phone, E-mail, or Skype. He showed little interest in her life and that hurt.

Nor did her mom pay attention to her request to stop all the drinking, smoking and drugs.

Ash had long, straight, sandy blonde hair and doe brown eyes. Her narrow chin and high cheekbones gave her face a heart shape. She considered herself cute, but not beautiful.

She stood 5’8’’ with a lean, athletic physique from sports and self-defense classes. Her full name was Ashley Green. She texted her girlfriend Gina and made a cup of coffee. Outside she found the spring morning air crisp and cool. But her ugly neighborhood was depressing. Her home was a lower duplex on 14^(th) and Rogers. Twice in the past year she stumbled across bodies from shootings. The sounds of gunfire were common. The Latin Kings and Spanish cobras waged war routinely there. It was mainly Latin folks there with a minority of poor white trash like herself. She’d had numerous problems there.

   On five occasions she’d been forced to scream and fight off bad men seeking to rape or strong-arm her. On two occasions she and Gina had been slipped roofies at house parties. Both times the

hard drinking Gina was knocked out. But Ash’s slower, more cautious drinking tipped her off to the scams. On one occasion Ash had clung to Gina and backed the boys off by screaming and throwing cups through the windows. It was enough to back the would-be rapist off. The second time several strong males seized her and her hidden knife flared to life in swipes the slashed a gash in one’s shoulder and jabbed a stab into another’s hand. All her screaming and stabbing got her and Gina out of the door.

   Another time a tall, muscular, bald headed, black man in a van had ambushed her in an alley. He put a knife in her neck and tried dragging her to his vehicle. She decided she’d rather die fighting then try surviving by obeying the evil man. She felt herself blacking out as they wrestled on the ground. He choked and hit her. Her fingers found a chili can from her bag of groceries spilled on the street. She slammed it into his nose and blood splattered from his nostrils. Briefly blinded by

tears, his grip slipped and she broke free running and screaming. A neighbor called police. She needed several stitches above her left eye. The cops swabbed her attacker’s blood on the can and got a match for a serial rapist. Cops caught him months later and she testified at his trial, putting him away for 10 years.

On another night, one of her mom’s boyfriends came in her room and tried to rape her. She screamed and stabbed at air while holding him at bay with her blade. Her mom dumped the guy, but then acted like it was Ash’s fault.

That really hurt. She had studied some basics of mixed martial arts. In two months she’d be

 Then she’d graduate high school shortly afterwards. Meanwhile she worked at a nice restaurant and made good tips there. She’d already saved enough for the first and last months’ rent on an apartment.

When Gina pulled up in her car, Ash jumped in, not knowing it would be the last sunrise she’d see as a human.

 

  \*\*\*\*

Medusa endured her thralls pulling buckshot out of her and a couple bullets. The sooner the lead and silver were removed the quicker and easier she would heal back to full strength.

Camilla had really caught her by surprise. She could sense the new man she’d bit passing out of her magic sensing range. For some reason Camilla had stolen the man away from her. Perhaps the guy was more important than she had sensed.

All her recent efforts to locate Tempest had come up short. She’d made thralls of numerous teens in the area and had them scatter to all the schools and outside activities teens did. She’d compelled a human to walk through every high school on the south side searching for Tempest during daylight with the channeling crystal created from the bone marrow and hair left of Tempest’s long ago burnt body. She’d even saturated the social media of Milwaukee teen activities. But all efforts had failed miserably.

That told her that Tempest was likely a bad girl that didn’t go to school or school activities. She was likely a dropout, maybe a hooker or stripper addicted to drugs or alcohol. With that in

mind Medusa had decided she needed a bad man with a record that was very familiar with the south side lower class to help her look through bars, dope houses, strip joints and wherever else the bad teen girl would go.

Judging by the way Camilla had stolen Kole that must be correct.

 

Medusa had been a vampire sense 766 A.D. at the age of 19. She’d been a tomboyish hunting guide on the large estate of woods her father owned. He’d loyally fought for the King of England and was rewarded when he retired from the Army after losing his left eye and hand.

He taught Medusa how to hunt game and the skills of archery, hand weaponry and dirty street fighting for survival. Her mother had died birthing her, so she was the closest thing to a son her father was going to get. She became quite skilled with crossbow, longbow, spear, knife and hunting game. She also became very good at training horses and hounds for hunting.

At age 12 she was tracking down a deer she’d shot with her bow when she stumbled upon a dozen men. They were dressed in motley assortment of mail and leathers. She tried to retreat, but they quickly flanked her from horseback while she was stuck on foot. She drew her bowstring back to level it at the apparent leader that approached her.

“Easy girl,” the tall, dark, and ugly ruffian said with lifted hands in surrender. “We don’t want any trouble. Just passing through.”

“This is my father’s land. He’s close, coming up behind me with a hunting party. I was sent

to track the wounded deer. I’ll tell him you mean no harm.” She lied.

With that short speech she started edging away. Without warning, several steeds launched forward in explosive charges. She bent her bow and feathered a foe. The shaft punched through armor plating like paper to lance his lung. He spilled from the saddle. She evaded another steed and managed a quick bow shot that knifed through another’s mail into his guts. Then a steed’s shoulder slammed into her and she was buried under the men’s bodies. Her dagger darted up into one’s throat. Then she was disarmed and raped repeatedly by nine survivors. Afterwards one stabbed her in the back several times and left her for dead.

She crawled a mile to her home, where her father worked on her wounds. After cleaning and cauterizing the worst wounds, her father, named Rolf, and his top servant, named Slocan, went after the rapists. They were both powerfully built, very skilled and experienced warriors and hunters that had fought in many battles together before. They swiftly caught up to the nine rapists.

Rolf and Slocan’s longbows sent shafts sibilantly hissing to pierce mail and impale the torsos of the two awake sentries on night watch .Surreptitiously they crept into the camp and covertly killed three men before the others woke.

Rolf swatted aside a stabbing short sword with his steel hand and knifed the life from his foe with a throat stroke. A sword swooped to shave his scalp from his flank. He pasted the face of his foe with a steel hand strike. Then Slocan was there driving a knife in the final foe’s back.

  The two middle aged warriors had slain all nine men with barely a scratch in return. 

Rolf and Slocan worked doubly hard in training Medusa after the brutal attack. But within four more years they were dead from a strange flu that almost killed Medusa too. A woman named Quandary came late one night to Medusa’s door. Glad for the company, Medusa let her in. Quandary stood almost 6 foot tall with a lean physique, beautiful face, sapphire eyes and long, straight, raven hair. She moved like a cat in Medusa’s opinion. Quandary was a vampire that made Medusa her thrall and lover for over a century. When Medusa wanted to end their affair Quandary didn’t take it well. Medusa slew her after a deadly fight.

 

Medusa had discovered Camilla dying during the Civil War when Northern soldiers had raped all the women on the estate and burnt down the buildings. No man remained. Camilla followed Medusa from there and they were lovers for almost forty years before Camilla went her own way. She objected to the way Medusa killed so many normal humans and supernatural ones as she stole money and magic items from others. About a decade later when they met again, a fight ensued before they both retreated badly wounded. Medusa had a healthy respect for Camilla’s prowess. But was quite confident she’d capture the witch that could conjure a spell for vampires to endure sunlight. Medusa wouldn’t lose such power.

She had 63 vamp thralls with her that she’d personally made. Most were young teen girls to help find Tempest. Medusa intended to master the sunlight spell herself eventually and dispose of everyone else that knew it, including Tempest.

Long term, she would create a power structure of thralls that worked daylight jobs in government, military, law enforcement and wherever else she wanted power. Any vamps not made by her would be magically tracked to their daylight shelters and slain. She would be the mother of a new empire.

\*\*\*\*

Camilla stayed at the wheel during the entire long drive. The alcohol lessened my anxiety. The trip was interspaced with questions and answers and some silences as we got to know each other. We arrived on a long, winding country road. The paved driveway we reached was in the midst of a vast forest. A 12 foot high fence was topped with razor wire. The driveway was barred by a gate with intercom and camera. Camilla punched a code and the gate clicked unlocked. I got out to push it open and locked it behind us.

It was a 75 yard long drive hemmed in by dense woods. There was a two-car garage attached to a three-bedroom ranch house with green aluminum siding and dimensional shingles on the roof. The basement was partially underground. A pair of dark mastiff dogs prowled around our vehicle and abruptly barked and hopped on the truck doors on Camilla’s side. One bared its teeth menacingly on eye level with her. In reply she clicked on the dome light so the dogs could see her and she bared her own fangs at them.

“Grrrrr,” she growled.

 

 

 

 

The hounds erupted into playful puppy barks as they obviously recognized her.

Beyond the hounds I sensed many vamp minds surrounding us. Over a dozen vamps came out of the woods all around us.

“It’s okay. They’re on our side”. She assured me.

They were staring at me expectantly. Her troupe was mainly young women with only a few males. All were attractive and athletic in appearance.

“What’s really going on here Camilla?” I questioned nervously.

“They believe in the prophecy, along with me. Medusa came after you because she interpreted the prophecy’s describing a man of coal to mean a name. Your name is Kole. You’re one of the few Kole’s on the south side of Milwaukee with a bad record, recently freed, bad guy. The prophecy says you are the key to Tempest’s survival and for her magic to return in force.”

I listened to her alertly. “It could be a mistake.”

“I don’t think so. Neither does Medusa. Look at your past life, Kole. You’ve spent it drinking and fighting, doing dumb things that put you back in jails and prisons. You’ve had no good luck finding love. That’s why you never married, never had kids. Even when you had a good career going you screwed that up too. Your life as a mortal always failed. Now as a vampire. You have a chance to become greater than ever.  Far beyond your dreams. Put your faith in me briefly and I’ll guide you to a great life. Yes, you could end up dead in a battle. But I can read your mind that you’d rather die than go back to prison. Become a superhero with me. What do you say?” She pitched.

 

 

 

I could feel her in my mind influencing my decision. Our vamp-thrall connection was strong. But she was right. Whatever awaited me as a vampire was likely better than what I lived like as a mortal man.

I nodded in agreement. “Okay. But I’ve got a lot of questions.”

“Ask away.” She smiled encouragingly.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

26 hours later found me leading Camilla and her vamp troop of 12 through the south side rave. Camilla’s crystal identified Tempest’s soul. We glimpsed her dancing.

She was pretty with blonde hair, blue eyes, and a lean athletic shape. We moved in.

Suddenly scores of Medusa’s vamps plowed through the crowd and mobbed us. Mace sprayed my face. Blade’s and bullets bit into my body. Fists, talons, and teeth tore into me. Bodies buried me. My gun was gone. My jujitsu hands seized and squeezed targets, snapping ankles, arms, fingers, necks and raking eyes. While breaking enemy holds and throwing blows somehow I’d bulled through the crowd to bolt out the back door, which is where I found Medusa feeding on Tempest. Beautiful, flame haired Medusa sensed me and spun. I faked a face punch, but snap kicked her shinbone. It shattered and she screamed. I snatched senseless Tempest and fled. I punched the window of a passing car and ejected the occupant. I shoved Tempest inside. We raced away.

I pulled over to try staunching her bit neck. But it was too bad. She was dying quick. With no

choice, I fed her my blood. Then I drove west on the freeway.

She became a vampire while sleeping. An hour later Tempest woke. She looked around wildly and patted her bloody clothes.

“What’s happened to me?” She cried in terror.

   “I’m a friend.” I assured her. “I’ll explain, but it’s a crazy story.”

  “Tell me!” she screamed.

“The vamp that bit you was about to wrap a sorcery slave collar around your neck to control you. In your past life you conjured a spell for vampires to endure the sunlight. On your 18^(th) birthday you’ll regain your past life’s magic. Medusa wants you to conjure the daylight spell for her.” I thought it sounded crazy saying it.

“Please explain this better!” She demanded looking very wild eyed and dazed.

“Ok. The vamp that made me claims that in your past life you were a vampire witch that conjured daylight spells that no one’s ever duplicated. The vamp lady is Medusa, and if she wraps a slave sorcery collar on your neck. She can force you to work the spell on her and her chosen allies. Then she’ll likely kill you, so she will become the vampire queen. My maker, Camilla, wanted to save you from Medusa and convince you not to conjure the spell again. But now I believe Camilla is dead, and I have no other vamp allies. I’ve helped you escape. But I don’t know what to do next, except keep moving. If you can stay free until you get your magic back, maybe then you’ll be too powerful for Medusa to enslave or slay. Let’s hope anyhow. “I shrugged.

   “I barely feel my injuries. This is insane.” She looked at all the blood on herself and touched her

news fangs in disbelief. We need a doctor. “She opined.

  “No we don’t. Our vamp magic dulls our pain perception and quickly heals our wounds.” I assured her.

“Why are you helping me?” She asked suspiciously.

“Camilla saved me from Medusa, now it looks like Medusa killed her. Saving you was Camilla’s mission. Now I guess it’s mine.”

I neglected to mention I’d been the one to find her and that I was the vamp that made her.

“Can you handle a pistol?”

“Yeah. My dad taught me.”

“Here. I handed her a Glock with two clips and a knife”. Be careful. Only brain damage kills vamps. But we’re so fast that our heads are hard to hit. Often you need body shots to slow us down for the kill shot. Stab for the brain if in close. Cutting off our heads also works.”

She looked at me like I was insane, but she clutched the gun reassuringly.

We had to stop for gas. I was filling the tank when I sensed a danger. I dove below the bombardment of bullets that riddled my truck bed. My pistol popped a shot that lacerated the leg of a machine gunner. In the truck, Tempest’s Glock excitedly popped nonstop for several seconds in a wide spread of lead that nailed one’s head. He flamed up.

 I sprinted from a torrent of bullets peppering my position. Some bullets bashed my back. My Kevlar vest blocked the bullets. I ran a 360 around the building to flank my foes. Several vamps were hauling Tempest to their van as she kicked, clawed, and bit. She buried her blade in one’s

brain. I shattered a sniper’s unsuspecting skull from behind with my gun butt. I grabbed his AR -15 and squeezed two brief bursts of bullets that sledged two heads to shreds. Tempest grabbed a fallen gun and flung some slugs and one stung the survivor as he strafed my spot. Moments later we drove away. I was relieved that Tempest’s new vamp battle instincts had just kicked in.

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

Over the next 20 hours we grew to know each other well. Since my blood made her a vamp, I could hear her thoughts when I focused. I could telepathically push requests at her, which she had magic inspired desire to obey. I felt guilt doing so, but my intentions were good. My power over her would wane soon enough. I taught her how to hypnotically compel humans to let her feed on them and use her tongue to heal the bite. Nor would the victim remember it. We stopped in Chicago to hunt. We fed on a pair of female joggers. The blood feeding high was more of a rush then sex, drugs, or adrenaline. It was easy to see how some vamps become soulless killers. I warned Tempest a vampire could cross the tunnel of light to heaven’s dimension if we weren’t mass murderers. Or we could obey our dark evil nature and be dragged to hell after death. We left the joggers alive. We ran the lakefront in blurs faster than cheetahs’ with leaps longer than any animal. We hefted cars. Our strength and celerity had increased seven times over our abilities as humans. We robbed a dope dealing, weapon collecting thug I knew. We left with a Kevlar vest for Tempest, some flash-bang grenades, and other stuff. We were on a magic high playing with our powers. I thought we were beyond our enemies’ detection range. I didn’t know how far a scrying spell could be done

with blood. My ignorance almost ended our freedom.

At a stop light 8 vamps tore our doors off and yanked us out to batter but capture alive. I felt like I fell into a blender of blades with body shots of bullets and buckshot. Our flash bangs blinded enemy eyes. We were whirlwinds of wrestling bodies, lashing limbs, and buzz saws of stuff slicing, dicing, and biting. I impaled an eye and hewed through a head and hand. My legs kicked efficiently to knock more off me. I detonated my last flash-bang and pounced from the pack’s attack to grab a fallen shotgun. My shower of pellet lead vaporized two heads. Tempest’s grenade strobed and boomed behind me. Suddenly she was by my side shooting someone’s revolver. Our two surviving foes were hiding, hurt bad. We fled and compelled a car from a passer-by. I drove.

“How did they find us?” She panted.

“I don’t know.” I admitted.

“What do we do?”

I spared her a scared glance. “Run.”

But as soon as my eyes try to focus on them, they become formless lights again. I can feel the presence behind me, whispering eldritch truths. The problem with those is a normal dude like me can’t understand them. So I just tune out the unknowable speech until it’s nothing more than white noise as I gaze upon the lights slowly drifting above the abyss. I’ve been having this dream often recently, I realize. Not my first recurring oniric journey by far, but I’m more used to the “classroom shame” type, though even these ones get weird, like that one time I spat out hundreds of live eels and they started flying,.. but that’s neither here nor there. Gripping my thoughts tighter, I gaze down at the hungering abyss below the lights and feel a shudder pass, better to keep on the lights then. And so i drift and the lights keep gently soothing me and they dance and dance and dance and dance-

I wake with a jolt at my alarm, you know the one, the annoying Iphone one everyone has heard at least once and hates. I keep it because of that hate though, it’s what gets me to wake up to turn it off, it’s what fuels me to forge on ahead with my day, to prove the smug alarm wrong, that I do have my life together, even if it’s wishful thinking. Morning preparations pass in a blur, at some points routine becomes so numb you start doing them without realizing, like when I leave my room with the blinds open, and come back to them close, i just do it without realizing it. It’s 7:03 by the time I’m done, not my best time, but not my worst by far, I’ll be 30 minutes early today, but that’s nothing new. 

The ride on the metro always feels like a second dream, the darkness of the underground and the few dim lights on the tunnel walls blending to create this weird hazy atmosphere. The people all present in a small spot, doing nothing, yet somehow so far from each other, each one in their own little pocket of reality, barely aware of each other. Yet I watch them, not intently, no more than one sweep of my eyes per person, but that feeling of surveying the people as they are in their bubble in this public space that feels more private than many fills me with a confidence, a form of understanding of my own reality by watching others.

 Lost in thought, I almost miss my stop, but a well timed gaze of the wall shows me we’ve arrived, “The Weapons Palace”, always so ominous with the towering justice building leading to the port. As usual, it takes me 5 to 7 minutes to make my way from the palace down to the Old Port, a place of wonder and horror all the like. At least in the morning there aren't too many weird happenings, but I still take my precautions and avoid the dim lit alleys that appear invitingly as shortcuts. Sure it makes the trip longer, but it’s a cost I’m more than willing to pay after what happened last Summer. 

I suppose now’s as good a time as any to give a small explanation of my job and place of employment, as I sit on the ancient stone stairs and wait for my coworkers on my phone. I’m an intendant (a rather dull title that in actuality represents a whole lot of responsibilities) for the City’s best (and only easily accessible to the uncommon mortal or not) bike rental shop! Come on Mondays for 25% off! Don’t ask why, no, there’s nothing weird going on at the Island on Monday, just don’t go there okay. Alright, promotions aside, it’s a pretty amazing job, most of it is moving bikes from the front shop to our little plot of land on the port, and talking to customers, which are typically tourists from all over the world! Sometimes they’re from places I've never even heard about, and I had a history major in high school. 

So anyways, I’ll keep you guys posted with interesting stuff that happens at work during my breaks. There’s already quite a backlog of fun stories I want to share, so most of these will be in the past, but I'll still write them in the present for the sake of clarity. 

**CHAPTER 1: A HOT DAY AND WORKING IN THE BASEMENT**

The heat today might just kill me. That and the sounds from the Basement. Truly a pick your poison type of situation: scorch under the City’s strange sun that burns and summons rain at a moment’s notice with no clouds; or toil in the Basement and be subject to its sounds that feel like nails on a chalkboard, it’s many tripping hazards, it’s ceiling so low i have to be almost crouching, and that’s not to mention the unknown of its too many hallways and how it’s somehow way bigger than the building it’s sitting under. 

Well, there’s some small graces, I don’t have to make that choice today; Manager just told me I’ll have to do a bit of both today. 

As I walk back inside the smooth air conditioned interior of our shop, I spot today’s Manager leaning on the counter. He’s a brown haired, short and hunched, 30-something year old man, with a face full of faults; crooked teeth, long nose, uneven chin. And yet, he always has this air upon him that makes him striking. Shrinking back with dread (which is a comical image if you can picture that he’s almost half my height) I dare ask “Is the Owner here today?”. 

As the quickly stammered out words leave my lips before I can think better of it, the air itself seems to still, the entire store seems too quiet, even the usual clanking of the Mechanic’s workshop we typically hear faintly is eerily absent. The Manager turns his slightly crossed eyes to me, his uneven gaze managing to still be searing. He rasps under his breath “He won’t be here this week, but keep your tongue to yourself, boy.” and gives a pointed look to the general direction of the glinting of one of the many hidden cameras. 

I know they can’t detect sound, but a chill nonetheless passes through me despite the scalding heat outside at the idea that He could very well be watching right now. Deciding to try and move on, I ask “So, what are we guys to do with all that heat today”, “Well, he says, we aren’t getting customers for another half hour, so why don’t you guys grab extra bikes from under and bring them to our plot while I sort out our overdue paperwork?”.

 Knowing better than to ask for another assignment, I give a curt nod and make my way to the Basement, knowing damn well than despite there being 3 other intendants here with me today, I’ll have to be the one to go down there, “you’re the one who can weather it the best after all”, they’ll say.

So I grimly make my way through our store, first through our long customer service section with its gleaming metal counters and many maps of the shifting lanes of the City. Then through our products section where we keep a handful of bike products in the event of a non client needing them and walks by our store (happens more than you’d think). Then I pass in front of the workshop, making sure not to actually set foot in the place since today the one holding the shift is the old Hob faced one, and I’d find myself with a wrench thrown at me full force if I did get too close to the forges. 

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, I arrive at the very back of our store, where there’s old rusted lift to get heavy objects down into and from the basement, the little staircase that’s so narrow you can barely fit through it, and the employee room and kitchen to either sides of the instalment. I stop by to take a sip of coffee, a nice reminder of the cleverness of the Owner’s design for the shop; by placing the break room and kitchen right next to the Basement’s entrance, he’d ensured that we would only go there for our actual breaks or in cases of true need. Anyways, enough stalling. Setting one unsure foot on the first small wooden step of the staircase, I inhale deeply, then take the plunge.

The atmosphere in the basement always hits you in parts. First, there’s the strange, almost comforting, feel of stillness. You know the old attic at your grandparent’s place, with dim orange light going through the cracks in the roof, and dust particles being visible through the beams of light? It feels like that, even though there’s no luminous beams nor dust clouds. Yet there’s this feeling, this strange moment where you think everything has gone still, that the world itself is catching its breath, as you first enter the Basement.

 And then there’s the second part; mystery. Many things don’t make sense in this shop, Heck, many things don’t make sense in this City. But there’s something about the Basement that always strikes out when you enter, even if you’ve never been in it before. How it’s definitely bigger than the building that sits above it, despite all logic making you think you’d be under the river only a couple of steps into it. How there’s an unknown amount of hallways twisting out from the main shape of the place. How you can find seemingly anything you could be looking for, except water.

The third part is always the worst, the sound. It doesn’t necessarily happen right after the first two parts. Sometimes you spend tens of minutes in the Basement before it happens. Sometimes you do whatever you need to do and exit and it doesn’t even show up. But it always comes back, and you never expect it. Today it hit me mere seconds after getting my bearings in the dim lit environment. The loud, indescribable blaring that seems to come from all around you, and deep from your bones at the same time. I’ve heard people argue over what it is and what it sounds like a lot more than you’d think. To some, it is akin to being right next to one of those large cargo ships foghorn as it goes off. To others, they swear it’s the sound of a nuclear siren. The only thing we all agree on is that it rattles you to your very core whenever it catches you. And it does, always. And there’s the other half of the sound, the somehow even less sensible one; the images. The sheer brutality of the sound seems to every time, no matter what or who, fill the person’s head with images of flesh, of meat, of skin.

There are benefits to being sent here though. First is the most obvious; since no one else, not even the managers, wants to be here if they can help it, that usually means I’ll be nice and alone down here. And the lack of a camera means that working in the Basement is primo time to be on my phone and write more of this. Of course I need to keep an eye on the time to not be suspicious, but I’m used to that. The other, more subtle benefit, is the stillness I mentioned before. Of course this is dependent on the raking and clanking being absent, but even when it appears, it usually fades in a few minutes. To be more precise, being alone in the basement feels the same as what most people I imagine feel in their own bedrooms. A feeling of security and privacy, of being able to be truly yourself without anyone to judge. It’s nice.

So, phone in hand and writing more of this as I go, I advance further in the liminal space. Passing by many branching corridors I’ve never seen before, I try to stay focused on my goal. Which, writing this, now would be a good time as any to explain why I’m down here today in the first place. The manager earlier didn’t see fit to explain it, as it was quite obvious (to me). 

You see, on particularly hot days like these, we often run out of bikes in the front shop at midday at best. So my current goal is to locate some extra large men’s bikes, and small women’s bikes, as those two are the ones we run out of the fastest. Thankfully the basement appears to contain anything and everything you could be looking for, as long as it’s not water.

I reach the first threshold, a small door full of holes, with a red “EXIT” glowing sign above it. All the employees know it doesn’t actually lead to an exit, and the long, winding and dark corridor visible through the holes is hopefully hint enough for anyone who *doesn’t* know.

Thankfully, I spotted a large rack of bikes to my left. I don’t have to risk a threshold today after all. Peering at the bikes neatly arranged, I manage to locate two extra larges, and a small. Great, now to get them off. You have to understand that with the sheer amount of bikes we have, they have to be \*extremely\* tightly arranged if we are to hold them all in. 

Now, my best friend, who is working on buying the shop from The Owner (but that’s a whole other can of worms for another day) is keen on selling a ton of them to save space, but that’s neither here, nor there. 

Meaning i have to move approximately a dozen bikes just to get the three i’m looking for. Right. 

Well, you get used to it.

It’s been a bit. Climbing back onto the large rusted metal cargo elevator with the bikes in tow, I grab the bright yellow control remote, a stark contrast to the damp darkness of the basement. The thrum of machinery around me rattles as the contraption begins its slow ascent back to a more civilized world. It’s funny how in any other context in this city, underground is synonymous to security, to peace. 

But in this shop, it’s a dreaded concept. What I'm trying to say is the actual transit period between below and aboveground is easily my favourite thing about the Basement. It’s this sort of quiet, in between, moment (despite the clicking and clanking noise) where everything seems suspended. Nothing really matters, all I’m doing is pressing the remote and holding the bikes so they don’t fall off in the deep below. There’s a beauty to that, I believe.

Alright, now that I’ve done the work, it’s time to do the work. You might think I’m joking, or making a pun, but anyone who’s ever worked in retail will tell you there’s always something to do. No matter what. Honestly I think there might even be some twisted divine game to that. Anyways, to sound less cryptic it just means I need to actually sort the bikes now. Bringing them to the front of the store, I give a jolly little middle finger to the manager, who responds with two of his own. That’s one of the things I truly enjoy about this job, the lightness of the tone, it probably helps that my best friend since middle school works here too, though to do him justice I will try not to talk too much about him until I give him a whole chapter of his own.

Anyways, to the more pressing matter at hand, I make my way to the clients who were waiting for their bikes the whole time. I hand them the goods, apologizing in the way we retail workers do: “I’m so sorry that the thing out of my control made you have to wait longer”. I obviously don’t word it that way, but that’s how it is. 

The clients’ sort of opaque eyes seem unfocused, and they give me a very half-assed response in their broken English. They’re the annoying type who speak none of the City’s official languages, and barely hold their own in american english, so working with them feels almost like working as an interpreter too. I never know where they come from, their accent is unrecognizable, their face unremarkable, and their native language unknown. So I don't feel too bad about them having to wait, after all, I had to wait for them to understand our system and make proper requests.

The rest of the day after this was pretty empty, some new clients here and there, but nothing too different from anything I’ve described so far, so I think I’ll just end this chapter here. If you guys have any questions about my work or this City I’d love to try and tackle them in Chapter 2, in the meantime I’m working on an interlude that will cover a different piece of my story.

**INTERLUDE: IN A LIBRARY, STUDYING UNDERGROUND**

I’m not working today. This may come as a surprise to some of you “Oh, why is he writing about a day he didn’t work? Isn’t his whole story about his job?”. You would be right, to some extent. This story is front, right, and center about my job and its quirks, but the City itself is home to many more interesting things than just the one shop I work at, and so I intend to share some of this in these “Interlude” type chapters. Shorter, less story driven, pieces that add to the worldbuilding and serve as pieces while I work on Q&A. So, what is it about today? As the title implies, I’m studying. I’ve yet to mention it, but my job is just a part time thing, I’m a student outside of it. Proudly studying in one of the City’s many Universities. A couple years ago I studied microbiology, and while I wasn’t terrible at it, it wasn’t particularly my cup of tea, so I switched universities and now I’m in a social media program. Alright, with that bit of personal character building out of the way, the metro is almost at my station, time to get going.

As I step off the metro, the sudden rush of lights and movement from the City’s bustling underground hits me. It’s not an unpleasant feeling. The lights dance around in a myriad of purples and oranges, and the shifting shadows of the many walkers, quietly shuffling through the tunnels to wherever they’re going, creates a sort of natural light show. The underground is a place of many wonders, its long winding corridors of red bricks and seemingly endless shops make for fun exploration, not that many of the citizens ever bother to. I don’t either, given that if I do I’ll be late to class. Following the route I already know, one underground makes way for another, as I enter into the underground part of this university. I’ve always wondered why the City has such a large subterranean network, and rumours seem to say it’s been here longer than anyone remembers, and that the Pope himself would have blessed the first underground train line.

 I still don’t know why, but I can’t say I disapprove of it. Having a large network connecting pretty much the whole city without the hurdles of cars and red lights is a pedestrian’s dream. Now as for why the universities themselves are partly buried, that’s something I have no explanation for. But again, it’s pretty convenient being able to go from one faculty to the other without ever going outside. 

I’m the first one to arrive at this class. Nothing surprising there. I simply find a comfortable spot next to a wall I can lean on and take the time to plug in my laptop and tablet to easily take notes from the lecturer’s speech. Looking outside the windows, the fog is quite thick today, some of the buildings having been almost completely devoured. I sign a silent prayer to anyone who would’ve been working there, and remind myself to write an entry about the fog, another day. 

Time stretches slowly. Students come in and take their place one by one, barely exchanging glances, let alone words. The lecturer, of course, is late. And banging on the classroom door roaring “INVITE ME IN YOU LITTLE GREMLINS, ANY MATERIAL YOU MAKE ME MISS TODAY WILL BE POINTS YOU WON’T HAVE ON THE EXAM”. The door, of course, is unlocked.

 The class looks at each other, though some don’t even seem to notice the commotion, too absorbed into whatever they’re doing, which I doubt is related to this class. I’ve already had to sign a classwide contract of binding evaluation last week so I definitely won’t be volunteering today, I tell myself.

 Finally, a scrawny looking guy gets up and goes to the door “Erm, you are formally invited to lecture us for this class and provide us with the reading material sir…?” he quickly says, looking at all of us and gulping while doing it. I personally think he’s done okay, but I’m no expert on the matter so I hope for his sake that he did. 

The teacher is in a really foul mood. This was to be expected with how late he was. There’s so much material to cover each class that any minute missed is almost a slide’s worth of information he can’t cover. And so today he angrily, shakily, quickly goes over each slide, a torrent of spit leaving his mouth each sentence, and the veins on his large bald head looking as though they’re about to explode. I scramble to keep writing down any of his incoherent, way too drawn-out sentences, my white metal pen making strides across the surface of my tablet.

The rest of the class isn’t all too eventful, just more of the same. At the end of the class, the teacher finally catches his breath, taking one long, powerful inhale, almost thirty seconds deep, then looks at each of us expectantly, an uncanny glare in his stare. The student who invited him, some three hours ago, stands up again and loudly, though shakily, declares “We formally thank you for teaching us today, may you give us another prosperous lesson next week.” 

I’m impressed, the guy must’ve spent part of the class researching the proper phrasing since he knew he’d have to do the farewell. The teacher looks back at him, a mix of respect and disappointment in his eyes, and wordlessly leaves. The pressure in the room drops, almost magically, and anyone looking close enough could notice every student relaxing in their own way. For me, I open the drawing app on my tablet and start doodling a sunset over waves for a couple minutes before making my way out of the classroom.

Back in the bricky underground of the university, I cross multiple buildings to arrive at the Grand Library. I don’t have any more classes today, but I believe it’s important to study for at least a couple hours each day to stay on top, and what better place for it than the Grand Library. I’ve always loved libraries, ever since I was a kid living in a ridiculously small countryside village in the mountains, with a library of only three rooms, it’s been one of my favourite places to hole up in and simply have me time, whether it’s to read, study, draw, or simply chill, I believe libraries have this aura of peace and quiet to them that no other place on Earth quite has for me.

You can then imagine my utter awe when I first stepped foot in the Grand Library. The sheer size of it, the absolute luxury of it all. It honestly made no sense to me back then, in the best way possible, how books were travelling across the whole place on conveyor belts and could just be grabbed or put there by anyone, how there were shiny copper pneumatic tubes with books going up and down floors, how the stacks seemed to reach impossibly high and lay farther than my eyes could see, how despite there being maps and signs, I seemed to always find new floors and sections I’d never seen before. I think it was truly a moment of pure dogmatic adoration for me back then.

I sit down at a spot I’d never been to before, at one of the library’s few extremities, a large seat in front of a wall wide window that stretches endlessly to my left and right, giving me a bird eye’s view of the city in front of me. Given the fog today I don’t see quite far, but it’s breathtaking regardless. Grabbing the reading material for tomorrow’s class, I softly drift into the library’s “flow state”, where nothing is real other than right now. 

Not much happens today after that, I take the train to the closest station to home, walking the rest of the way through the groves and gardens of the P██  ███ll, the neighborhood I live in. My next work day is this Friday, so you’ll hear from me again soon.",1,1765142945.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,0,1.0,False

I live for that shit, babe.

Do you like the mundane letters, too?

Hope so. 'Cause I'm prolly gonna keep writing them, lol.

Love you.

1pgu31w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgu31w,"The faux Grosche, 2 cups","Long story short: I'm a low-sighted woman who bought a pot believing it be a Grosche. It is marked ""Forever"" which, as I found out, is an importer of Chinese-made moka pots. This one, however, looks exactly like Grosche Milano Steel...scaled-down, because it is a two cup pot. A product Grosche doesn't even sell.

It brews great coffee, though, and the build quality is decent, no sharp edges when you reach into the boiler to dry it, for example.

First slide: The ""Forever"" pot standing in front of my other pots, which are, left to right: A two cup Brikka, a 6 cup Vev Vigano Nero and a 3 cup Bialetti Moka Express. 

Second slide: You can see that the bottom of the upper chamber is oddly convex. The Grosche pot looks just the same on the inside. Some people might find this annoying when cleaning the pot, but I can get down there with a brush, and for drying, it isn't such a big deal. If anything rusts on you with a stainless steel pot, it's the boiler because that one is often made out of 403 (contains chromium, but not nickel) steel, which is less resistent to corrosion that 304. If you wash 304 with water, dry it as best as you can and put it up to fully dry, it won't rust on you.

Third slide: The basket is small, it holds about a tablespoon full of coffee. U.S. quarter for size comparison. It is a little smaller than that of my Brikka, which is also sold as a two cup pot, and conspicuously smaller than that of my three cup Moka Express.",2,1765142748.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

I remember the silence first. The whole street looked hollow, like the world had been scraped clean. My thoughts felt the same—blank, empty. But the feeling of being watched kept jabbing at my nerves.

I checked behind me.

Nothing.

Just that miserable stretch of asphalt.

The second I turned forward again, hands clamped around me. I didn’t even have time to shout. They dragged me across the pavement toward a peeling apartment door. I knew what was coming. It had already happened. Many times.

The three men said nothing. The first one raised a gun, as casual as lighting a cigarette. He put the barrel to my forehead.

The shot didn’t hurt at first. It burned. I felt metal glide through my skull and fry whatever softness lived inside my brain. I collapsed, locked in my own body, drowning in the warmth of my own blood. I couldn’t scream. Couldn’t move. I just died quietly, suffocating in myself.

Then I woke up.

Sweaty. Gasping.

For a full second, I wasn’t sure which world was real.

I went through my morning routine: shower, coffee, food.

Everything tasted wrong.

Everything felt wrong.

And every morning the same question gnawed at me:

Why do I feel my own death so clearly?

\--

November 15th, 2029

Sleep came slowly—four hours of preparation, breathing exercises, trying not to think about dying again. Then the dream snapped into place.

I was in a home I didn’t recognise, in the middle of an argument with a woman who felt like a wife I’d forgotten. We weren’t speaking the same language; she yelled, I said nothing.

I don’t know why I reached into the couch cushion and pulled out a knife. I don’t know why I felt like I was about to use it.

Before I could move, she stormed back into the room holding a gun. The look in her eyes wasn’t human.

She aimed. Fired.

Same spot. Same numb collapse.

Two dreams in a row—same death.

But this time I didn’t wake up.

This time I kept lying there, bleeding out, growing colder. My vision dimmed slowly, like someone lowering a lantern. Somewhere behind me, gravel crunched under footsteps.

An old man sat down beside me.

“Mind if I join you, young man?”

I woke up already sitting upright, shaking violently, like something had yanked me back into my body.

\--

January 7th, 2030

Two months since I saw him.

I know he was real.

Nothing in dreams ever sounds real—their physics are wrong, their voices hollow.

But his feet on the gravel were solid. Heavy. Alive.

I haven’t dreamt since.

\--

April 23rd, 2030

Five months of peaceful darkness.

No death. No waking up screaming.

My days felt long but bearable. I got work done. I felt human again.

Then I closed my eyes tonight, hoping for more darkness.

But I forgot falling asleep.

The dream swallowed me instantly.

A park.

Empty. Silent.

No sun. No moon. Just a dull glow leaking from the sky.

And behind me:

“Sit, cutie,” he whispered. “It’ll all be over soon.”

The old man’s face was wrong. Rotting. Skin crawling with tiny pale worms. His voice dripped honey and filth.

I managed to speak this time. “What the fuck is this?”

He looked almost bored.

“Do you really enjoy dying?”

“…sometimes,” I admitted without understanding why.

He studied me for a long, punishing silence.

“You know you can make it permanent, right?""

I suddenly woke up coughing blood.

\--

May 3rd, 2030

Ten days awake.

No sleep.

Hallucinations crawling on the walls.

I can’t stay awake anymore.

I’ll die for real if I try.

Tonight I’m going back in.

The candles help. The breathing helps. I fall asleep in an hour.

The park again.

A shadow figure on the swing set.

Ignoring me.

Then the old man appeared at my side, like he’d always been sitting there.

“You know you can end everything anytime,” he murmured.

“That’d kill me.”

“Exactly.”

He pulled out a gun and shot me point-blank.

The bullet turned to ash on my forehead, but I still felt it tunnel through my mind—just for a fraction.

“So what’s the point?” I asked, trembling.

“To experience what I have. For the next five hundred years or so.”

My stomach knotted. “You’re insane.”

“I did it,” he said. “So can you.”

Two men with rifles walked out of the trees.

He didn’t warn me.

They both shot through my body.

The bullets ripped through my organs and pushed them aside, massive clots escaping my torso.

Every second of it was pure.

\--

May 4th, 2030

I’m becoming like him.

A masochist of the worst kind.

Tonight I end it.

I fall asleep already gripping the decision in my mind.

Back in the park.

“So this is the one?” the old man asked.

“Yes.” I handed him a Beretta I didn’t remember holding. “Shoot me in the head. Make it real.”

“Kid,” he sighed, “if it were that easy, I’d have left this place a millennium ago.”

My throat tightened. “So what—I’m trapped here forever?”

“No,” he said gently, almost fatherly. “We can try together.”

I raised the gun to my temple.

My hand shook so violently I thought the barrel would slip.

His rotting fingers wrapped around mine.

He pulled the trigger with me.

The bullet crawled through my skull in slow motion—warm, slicing, absolute. My brain folded around it like melting butter. I felt the moment the world let go of me.

And then—

Nothing.

Real nothing.

\--

December 8th, 2030

It took seven months for my body to wake up.

A chunk of my skull gone.

Half a year unable to feed myself, move right, or think clearly.

Since then, I haven’t dreamt once.

Part of me misses it.

Part of me is terrified.

Every night before sleep, I ask myself the same question:

What would’ve happened if I’d stayed in the dreams?

Tonight, as the warmth pulls me under, I hear gravel footsteps beside my bed.

A familiar voice whispers:

“Mind if I join you, young man?”",2,1765142712.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,0,1.0,False

1pgtvdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pgtvdb/theres_something_in_the_coffee/,There's Something In the Coffee...,"I’ve been awake for eighteen days. 

That's not hyperbole or any form of exaggeration. I've genuinely gone all this time without any sleep or rest. 

Not even a wink.

And the craziest part is that I don't feel like I need it. I don't know how I'm still alive. These last few days have been some of the craziest of my life, and I feel like it's about to get much worse. 

It all began on the eve of one of my exams. The dreaded finals week had come around, and although I had studied for it throughout the month of November and prepared myself to the best of my ability, it was still getting to me. Something about having a considerable portion of grades dependent on one test… just never sat right with me. 

I had been lying in my bed for the past three hours, tossing and turning, frustrated, unable to allow myself to slip into that glorious world of slumber. It was 4 a.m… and my next final was…. At 8... 

Eventually, I’d had enough, so I decided to get out of bed and pull an all-nighter to do some extra studying. After all, staying up through the night had always been better than dozing off for two hours and then being rudely awoken, surprisingly enough. 

So, with that, I sighed, got up from my bed, and started putting on my clothes. I headed out the door into the warm, humid Floridian air. The campus library was open, as was to be expected; they were always available 24/7 during this time.

The building was entirely still. The information desk was open, and some poor soul who had taken the student job was staffing it overnight. I looked over, and she didn't even move her head to notice me, staring blankly at the screen ahead of her. 

There were other people in here, too, just not a lot. Now and then, you'd see the occasional chair filled by a zombified student, a cup of coffee in one hand, their laptop in the other, and a lovely pie of pizza resting on the table in front of them. 

*Typical.* 

In the center of the main lobby stood a beautifully crafted table with a white cloth draped over it. On top were two big metallic cylinders, coffee dispensers, with a basket containing a bunch of small paper cups to the right. Further to the side a variety of creams, sugars, and sweeteners. 

The sight didn't surprise me. This school had a tradition of offering free coffee to all students in the late hours during this time. It was a nice gesture for everyone stressing out about their upcoming exams, I suppose. 

I'm not a coffee drinker —never was— I despise the taste. Still… it *was* 4 a.m., and I was about to stay up all night. So, with that in mind, I caved and filled up one of the paper shot cups, making sure to load it with so much cream that, frankly, you probably wouldn't be able to call it coffee anymore. 

With that, I made my way up the stairway to the right, which took me to the third floor, the computer lab. 

I approached one of the tens of empty computers, logged into my account, and pulled up my professor's PowerPoint presentation.

I practically gulped the coffee down in a minute, and it tasted about how you would expect.

But the texture, the texture was off…

As the hot liquid slid its way down my throat… I felt… something like a rough surface pass by my tongue. It was almost as if little tiny balls had been in the fluid, like cottage cheese, but a tad less noticeable. I didn't think much of it then, figuring it was probably something I put into the beverage, or something with this particular brand. And a quick look inside the cup revealed nothing unusual, so I quickly forgot about it. 

I was considering getting another one when, just ten minutes later, the caffeine took effect. It was insanely powerful, more than I expected. My heart was throbbing in my chest, as I was jolted into awakeness, and I felt like I had just slept ten hours.

There was an ongoing gag going around the school that they injected the coffee with jet fuel. Well, I guess now I know where that came from. 

Suffice it to say, I'm glad I didn’t follow through on what I was considering. I think I would've succumbed to cardiac arrest almost immediately. 

I continued studying until about 7 a.m. when the sun began to peak over the horizon. As I exited the building, stepping into the crisp morning air, I still felt perfect. The heart pounding in my chest was the only thing telling me that this period of energy was artificial.

I finally understood why people were such avid coffee drinkers, and I thought that maybe I should do this more often. 

It ended up taking until about 2 p.m. that day for the caffeine to wear off. At last, I could feel my body begin to slow down, and the full effect of the stunt I had just pulled came over me like a rock. It was like somebody had snapped their fingers, and I just… crashed… 

I decided to return to my bed and attempt to sleep off last night. Not for too long, though; after all, I had more finals in the morning. And thinking of that got my fear going once again. I said I had prepared the best I could, but the one that was coming up... Oh boy… No matter what I tried, I couldn't figure out half of it. And the thing was worth about 40% of my grade… If I didn't do well on this final, it would tank my class average.

A slight panic set in at the thought of it. I should mention that I have a mild case of anxiety. Not to the extreme where I get regular panic attacks, but just enough to make every testing situation about ten times worse than it is for anyone else. I tossed and turned for about thirty minutes in this pit of dread I was drowning in, when suddenly... something very peculiar happened.

My sleepiness disappeared again. It was just… gone… entirely and utterly vanquished. I didn't know what to make of it at first but blamed it on the adrenaline currently shooting through my veins. I decided to splash some cold water on my face and take a hot shower to calm down.

It didn’t help… two hours of laying there passed… nothing… It didn't make sense to me. It was as if the crash had just… ended…

As I wasn't getting any sleep, I decided to use this time to work some more. Being so worried about what was coming up and all, I did just that until about 11 p.m. that night… 

And again… I just… still didn't feel tired… I spent hours tossing and turning, hoping, begging myself to fall asleep, but no dice. 

I had enough at this point. 

I pulled out my phone and did a quick Google search on how long caffeine is supposed to last. Most results pointed me in the direction of four to six hours, with the more extreme estimates being up to twelve. This had already gone far longer than any of the websites suggested. 

I rationalized it away by saying that perhaps I was just sensitive to caffeine and that since this was my first real exposure, it would take a while for the effects to subside. 

I was going to crash eventually. I just needed to wait it out. 

But that didn't happen. It was now 4 a.m., and I was still lying awake in bed, feeling no different. I decided to spend the night studying again, very decidedly *not* taking any of the coffee this time, slightly annoyed that I would likely regret it in the middle of the next morning's final. 

I didn’t. 

Nothing had changed. And now, I was starting to get concerned. 

Did I have some adverse reaction or something? What was going *on?* I called my mom to ask what she had to say. She was equally concerned for my well-being and suggested I take a trip to the university's health center.

The best they could do for me was to recommend I take some medication and see if that fixed it, and she instructed me to call a doctor if it didn't.

I’m sure you can guess the results of that little experiment. 

Not only did the medication take no effect, but as I lay awake for hours, a chill sweat began to trickle down my skin. It started gradually, but it eventually became intense, such that my sheets quickly became drenched in the stuff. My head as well… was *throbbing; a piercing*, screaming headache shot its way through my brain, only getting worse, as if I had just been shot. 

There was a different kind of thumping in my head, though… one much more unexplainable. On top of the raging headache, I felt something else—a tiny, slight, unrhythmic tapping… seeming to occur in different parts of my brain. I paid close attention as it slowly moved from one side of my forehead to the other, then around the back of my skull, before continuing to wrap itself around. 

I didn’t know what to make of it. And that’s also where I drew the line.

Enough was enough. 

I was calling a doctor tomorrow. 

Well, I did so the following morning, and the response I got was something like, ""Sorry, the best we can do is give you an appointment in two weeks.""

*Great.* 

All praise the healthcare system, I guess. 

But, accepting it was the only thing I could do, I said, ""Okay,"" booked the meeting, and hoped it wouldn't worsen.

The following day was when things started to get a little scary. My mother nearly gasped when she saw me on FaceTime, saying I looked ‘paler than snow’.

I had to agree with her because, in the middle of our conversation, I got a sudden wave of extreme nausea, gagging harder than I ever had before. I hastily hung up the call and sprinted to the bathroom, just in time to empty my stomach contents into the toilet bowl. I sat there, retching for the next hour. All the while, the headache and those odd irregular feelings circling themselves around my brain continued.

And if that wasn’t bad enough, as I was donating my insides to the indoor plumbing, I swear I saw something move in the corner of my eye. It was brief… but it looked like an… odd, elongated shape slowly moving up the bathroom wall. I didn't get a good look at it, as it appeared to hurry out of view entirely before I turned around.

I searched the entire place, top to bottom, but there was no sign of the damn thing. It was like it had just… vanished… 

That was the final straw. 

I assumed the sleep deprivation was getting to me, and I was beginning to hallucinate, even though I still felt as awake as ever. But I didn't care anymore. Enough was enough; I could not, in any way, wait *two* *weeks* for an appointment. 

And so, without any options left, I picked up the phone and dialed 9-1-1. 

The paramedics arrived within minutes and I quickly explained the situation to them, and, after seeing how terrible I looked, they immediately put me on a stretcher and whisked me away to the local hospital. 

The two-hour wait in the emergency room was what I could best describe as miserable. I was stuck sitting on a cheap plastic chair in a sanitary, lit, open room surrounded by patients suffering from god knows what illnesses. The icing on the cake was that my symptoms continued to worsen throughout my entire stay. 

My vision was beginning to go hazy, and I swear I kept seeing something move in my peripheral vision, like what I found back in my apartment. 

Finally, after hours of torture, The doctor finally called me and escorted me to my new room. He introduced himself as Dr. Jones and ran me through some basic questions, you know, the typical stuff.

“How are you feeling, Kevin?”

“Terrible.”

“Have you taken any drugs recently?”

“Other than Nyquil? No…”

“Do you drink any alcohol?” 

“Very rarely.” 

It was just your standard, run-of-the-mill doctor's questioning, but soon, one toward the end caught my attention. 

“Did you drink any caffeinated beverages recently?” the doctor asked.

I stopped for a moment. ""...I mean, I *did* have a shot of coffee… but it was… three… four days ago?""

The doctor made a hum of acknowledgment, his expression considerate before shaking it off. ""Okay… well, that shouldn't be causing this, then… I'm going to be honest with you, Kevin: I'm not sure what's happening… So what we're going to do now is run you through a few tests to hopefully determine an answer… and if we can't find anything… then we might have to keep you here overnight to perform a sleep test.""

I snorted.

*Sleep test… right…* 

The preliminary tests went exactly as expected. They took some fluids, checked my blood pressure, and looked at my heart rate—all the standard stuff. Everything turned out negative for any sort of issue. My vitals were perfect… frustratingly so. 

And so, I was then quickly informed that they would be proceeding with the sleep examination that night. They escorted me to a place that looked more like a hotel room than a hospital. A big window at the far end would let in plenty of natural light during the day. There was another blurred-out window on the right side, and a neat little old-fashioned lamp stood on a nightstand. The bed itself looked rather cozy and had a lovely wooden finish as a headboard. If I weren't so ill, I would've admired it. 

After hooking me up to various pieces of equipment that I couldn’t even explain the purpose of, Dr. Jones spoke again. ""Alright… you're all set up, Kevin. Now, don't worry. We're going to be watching from the adjacent room the entire night, okay? So if you need anything… just ask.""

I nodded my head, the only response I could make in my current state, and watched as he handed me a couple of pills. 

""Oh, and one more thing, here is some Silenor for the night… it's an insomnia medication; it should be more powerful than the stuff you had before… Hopefully, it might have an effect."" 

After I swallowed what he had given me, the doctor made his way out of the room and turned off the lights before closing the door. And just like that, I was left with nothing but complete, overbearing silence, broken only by the gentle hum of machinery. 

As my eyes hadn't adjusted yet, darkness swallowed everything. I gently eased my head back into the pillow and shut my eyelids, hoping to finally catch some Z’s. The bed was really comfortable; in any other situation, I would've fallen asleep within minutes. 

But now… 

One hour passed…

Two hours passed…

I was beginning to get frustrated. It seemed that the tablet the doctor had given me wasn't helping. So I just lay there, staring at the ceiling for some time and holding my eyes shut.

Nothing happened until about midnight, and quite frankly, I wish it had stayed that way. I immediately felt the throbbing in my head return, and the gentle taps that seemed to be circulating around my entire head went into overdrive. It was more evenly spread now, too. Rather than being in specific locations, it was across what seemed to be the entire circumference of my brain all at once. I could almost...*hear*…it inside me, all the little contacts… like crinkling paper.

I sprung up to a sitting position, clutching my face in pain. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness now; what was once pure nothingness had brightened into a shadowy cacophony that ate the corners and walls of the room. The nausea returned, and stars pulsated through my vision, and just then… something caught my eye. 

It sounded in my ears too…coming from the dark, shadowy corner that lay just to the left of me…running smoothly and slowly up the wall. 

I looked over to the source of the noise, which was partially illuminated by the glow of the machinery, and what I saw made my heart drop. Tucked away where the left and back wall met each other was what appeared to be a black, slim, elongated tube of some sort… but no, it wasn't that. I peered closer at it, and I realized it had legs… hundreds and hundreds of little tiny legs squirming and latching onto the surface in unison with the noise. 

The animal slowly crawled its way upward, paying me no attention. Its long body wriggled in perfect harmony as it made its way towards the ceiling. 

 I stayed frozen in fear for a few seconds before I immediately launched up from my bed and screamed, practically ripping the equipment down from where it was standing, unleashing a loud crash.

The doctors stormed into the room and immediately turned on the lights, demanding to know what had happened. I was hysterical. My head was still pounding, it felt like my brain was constrained.

""The-there's something in the corner of the-""

But as I looked to point it out, what I had seen was gone. 

“Kevin… How long did you say you were awake for…?” Dr. Jones asked with concern. “It’s common with severe sleep deprivation that you may experience hallucinations… ”

It made sense, but what I had seen felt so... life-like…

Unsurprisingly the doctors informed me that they would have to cancel the sleep test because my ruckus of throwing everything to the floor managed to break the equipment I was strapped to, so… *yay me*. 

However, They said that they could retrieve all the data up until now and that they would be able to review it as soon as possible and decided it would be best to move me to a standard hospital room while they awaited my results. 

They could barely move me five feet before I started gagging, and soon the floor was greeted with a pristine covering formed from my stomach contents, delivered by yours truly. 

Jokes aside, I finally got a good look at what was coming out of me. It was filled with what looked like… tiny black spheres… I didn't know what to make of it; quite frankly, I was worrying about other things, but it seemed to stun the doctors for a moment, too. However, they quickly got back to the task and escorted me out into the hallway. I didn't see what became of my mess afterward. 

After getting into an admittedly less comfortable hospital bed, I finally had the opportunity to scroll through my phone. It was completely blown up with panicked messages from my mother asking me what was happening and demanding to know why I wasn't answering. I called her back, and the second she saw the medical bed behind me, she nearly exploded into tears. 

“What happened?!” she cried out. 

I explained everything that had been going on since I last called her: the sudden wave of nausea I experienced, calling 9-1-1, and the sleep test. We, or rather, she, came to the conclusion that she would fly down and visit me as soon as possible to hopefully get this whole situation sorted. It was… nice… a silver lining in all this awfulness. At the very least, I was going to be able to see my mother again. 

Doctor Jones interrupted our conversation, and after I said one last goodbye to my mother, he simply sat down and sighed. He was holding what looked to be a couple of sheets of paper in his hand. 

""Hey, Kevin…"" he started. ""So, we've been reviewing your sleep test data as promised, and well…"" He showed me what looked to be a graph with a long squiggly line complete with small valleys and ever-towering hills. ""Your brain waves… they're highly irregular… look."" He began tracing his finger along the jagged line. ""They are much more active than they should be… and they nearly go off the graph here when you had your… episode… It's highly alarming."" 

I stared at him in silence, not knowing exactly what to say. ""One thing's for sure; we're going to have to get a head CT done as soon as possible… I'll see how soon I can get you in for an appointment…""

I could barely utter an ‘okay’ before he left the room, and finally… I completely broke down. This whole thing… It was a massive nightmare. I had no idea why this was happening, and it seemed like even the doctors, the world-class professionals, did not have any semblance of a clue either. I just wanted this all to end; I just wanted to get some sleep, finally. I wanted to stop… *seeing* that creaturein the corner of my eye. But alas, I should’ve known my prayers would all fall on deaf ears. 

A few hours later, Doctor Jones returned and escorted me to the head examination room. It was small and white, with what looked to be some sort of control desk behind a wall in the front, and a large machine resembling an MRI taking up most of the space, making a lot of noise, far more than I had expected.

I lay down on the little bed, feet facing the device, and put my arms over my head as the assistant wheeled me into the machine. I can't lie; I had a certain amount of dread come over me. I knew this was all normal procedure and that it was going to be painless, but something about this was daunting.

Dr. Jones and the others returned to the control area near the entrance and advised me the scan was about to begin. However, I didn't even make it for what seemed like five seconds, when there appeared to be distress from the control center, and one of the assistants practically ran out of the room.

My heart began to pound in my chest.

Dr. Jones approached me immediately, a grim expression on his face. 

""Listen, Kevin…"" He sighed. ""Normally, CT scan results take weeks to get back to you, but we've seen some things here that I believe might have to be taken care of *now.”* 

He ushered me back to the area he had been in during the process and pointed at the computer screen, and I nearly gasped when I saw the image being projected. 

There was a picture of my head, which was to be expected, but there was something else. Wrapped around my brain was a long, bug-like creature with two big antennas at the front and an uncountable amount of legs; the whole thing bore resemblance to a giant millipede, yet, it was slightly fatter and was long enough to cover the entire circumference of my brain twice. There was something else, though; that… creature… looked precisely like the one I had been seeing in my hallucinations, albeit a bit smaller. 

My heart lurched in my chest as I stared at the unnerving image. I was feeling sick to my stomach, but not due to the illness this time. 

“What the *hell?!”* I exclaimed. 

""Yeah…"" Dr. Jones commented. ""I have no idea where this came from; I've never seen anything like it before… but we're going to have to get it out of you pretty fast.""

I could only bob my head in agreement, still lost in my thoughts. This… *passenger*… had been sitting inside me for god knows how long… was *that* what I felt when I experienced that tapping inside my head…? Was it that… *crawling around up there?* 

As if on cue, it started again. I paid closer attention this time, and I could really feel it—all those little legs skittering along my brain. I immediately dissolved into a blind panic, but that only seemed to make it pick up the pace. 

It almost seemed… excited… or stimulated in some way. 

My headache returned, and I collapsed to the ground, my fear briefly forgotten. Doctor Jones stood up to help me back to my feet and looked at me with a concerned expression. 

""Look, Kevin… I'll try to schedule surgery to get it removed as soon as possible… until then… just try not to think about it too hard… okay?""  

*Don't think about it too hard.*

That was easier said than done; how was I supposed to go back to my room and pretend something like this hadn't just made itself a home up there? My terror got worse as I was ushered back to my room. I still felt it the whole time… it had gotten active recently, and my symptoms were starting to flare up again. 

I was overwhelmed with illness the second I got back and immediately sprinted toward the bathroom. The substance I excreted looked the same as before… filled with those… weird black spheres. 

I didn't pay attention to it, though. I was still thinking about that *thing.* It had been *real*… maybe my visions hadn't been—but whatever that was had been living inside me this whole time. I tried, desperately, to calm myself down and tell myself it would be out in a day. That didn't make it any better. 

After finishing my rounds, I got up weakly to wash my hands.

And that’s when I saw it. 

Slightly above my eyebrows, in the middle of my forehead, was what appeared to be a massive bulge. It sat there, completely still. As I looked at it further, I realized it wasn't just that… It was a long, winding… bug-like cylinder that circled itself around my entire head. I could even see the pieces of my hair slightly displaced by the shape, as it sheathed beneath them.

I don't know what came over me. But somehow, all worry and tension immediately disappeared. I found my right hand slowly drifting up towards my scalp as if it had a mind of its own. I'd say I tried to stop it, but that would be a lie. It was almost like… like I was in some sort of trance. My mind had gone completely blank as my arm slowly hovered up further toward the anomaly.

Then… I touched it and squeezed it gently. It was soft, almost like some sort of sponge, but I didn't have much time to register it as it immediately squirmed away, darting out of view and behind my head at a speed that looked similar to a bullet fired from a gun. 

This is what finally ripped me from my state. 

I screamed and leaped backward, almost splitting my head on the bathroom tiles. I sat there breathing heavily for a moment, hyperventilating, nearly crying before I worked up the courage to look back into the mirror.

It was gone. 

I did a complete 360 to make sure, but no matter what angle I checked… it wasn't there anymore. 

My headache intensified once again, and I ran to my bed, curling up in the fetal position, tears streaming from my eyes. I remained like that for hours. The doctors had come in to check on me and see what was wrong… but after I explained what I had seen, they found nothing. Still, their presence helped calm me down a tiny bit. 

That night, I simply lay staring at the ceiling. I don’t think I would’ve been able to sleep even if I didn’t have this odd condition. 

Nothing else happened. But still, it was bad enough. The image of what I saw on the CT scan and what happened to me later in that bathroom was *haunting.* And no matter how hard I tried, I simply could not get it out of my head. 

My mom arrived the following morning, and I explained everything to her. She was understandably just about as freaked out as I was, but she relaxed a tad bit when I told her about the doctor's plans to remove what was now being dubbed a ‘parasite’.

My neurosurgeon, with a team of doctors, an assistant, and my anesthesiologist, came in a few minutes later, announcing that it was time to perform the surgery, and told my mom to remain in the waiting room. With one last hug, we said goodbye and split up, to hopefully see each other again once this was over.

""Don't worry. I'm going to take good care of you,"" my anesthesiologist reassured me as she prepared the machine. 

Bright, blinding lights sprang to life as the doctors prepared their tools and laid them out on the table next to me. I knew I wouldn't be feeling any of this, but still, I have to admit, it did give me a small pit in my stomach to see all of the sharp objects that were about to be used on me.

They stuck an I.V. into my arm and hooked me up to all kinds of equipment, including heart rate and blood pressure monitors. I listened as the rhythmic beeping sprang to life and tried to ease myself, staring into the piercing lights above. 

""Okay, Kevin,"" my anesthesiologist smiled. “Once I set this mask on your face, I want you to count down from ten in your head. I promise you will be asleep before you reach zero. You'll be awake later, after the first part of the surgery has been completed.""

With that, she gently placed it over my nose, and, slowly breathing in the chemicals streaming through the tube, trying not to think about how I'd soon wake up with an open skull, I did as she’d requested.

10...

9…

8…

6…

0...

I reached the end of my ten-second countdown. I was still awake. I began to worry; nothing around me had changed. I tried to say something, to get up and tell the doctors that I was still there, but the second I tried to move, I realized I couldn't. I was locked in place, bound to the table, completely paralyzed. I couldn't even do so much as wiggle my fingers. 

My heart beat faster in my chest as I looked over at the anesthesiologist who was viewing my heart rate and other vitals, and thankfully, she seemed to realize something was wrong, too. 

""He's awake,"" she said bluntly, slightly confused as she stared at the screens in front of her. “Don't start yet; I'm going to increase the dosage.""

She turned some nob on the machine connected to my mask, and all of a sudden, I felt an intense surge of the stuff getting pushed through the tube, far more potent than it had been before, forcing itself into my nose. My paralysis was getting stronger, but I was still not falling asleep. 

I began to panic, as evidenced by the ever-increasing beeping on the monitor beside me. The anesthesiologist started to swear under her breath as she turned the dial up even more, almost bringing it to its max. But nothing was working. I lay there, awake on the table, unable to do or say anything, while the doctors all crowded around me, trying to get me to go under. 

Suddenly, the lights above me went out, and the room went completely dark. All the medical staff blurred into the sides of my vision, still and unmoving. What was once a soundscape filled with the frantic movement of personnel and nurses and the rapid beeping of machinery was replaced with complete and utter silence. 

I sat there, breathing heavily, and that thing began to scurry again, rushing as I felt it crawl all around my head. I wanted to throw up. It was incredibly disgusting, and it just wouldn't *stop.* 

There was something else, though. A couple of minutes passed, and something crept through the silence. A soft but noticeable crackling noise came from the far end of the room, something I couldn't see from here, slowly making its way ever closer. 

I stared into the distance in terror as the sound unmistakably began wiggling its way up the foot of my bed before changing slightly, now sounding like small, tiny micro taps on plastic.

It wasn't long before two creepy small antennas became barely visible, peering through the darkness, just into view. A couple of seconds later, the head arrived. It was here… the same creature I had seen on the CT scan, although it looked much larger.

It continued to work its way up the end of my bed and slithered down the other side. I tried to get up, to run, but the paralysis drug that the anesthesiologist had given me was doing its job; I was still stuck. I was left helpless, only able to watch in horror as it slowly squirmed its way over onto the bed and up onto my foot, giving me the sensation of hundreds of tiny little appendages pushing their way up my body.  

It was relaxed, seemingly unphased by all my struggles as it got closer and closer, gently wrapping its way around my limbs. I could look at it now; it definitely resembled a massive millipede, but no exoskeleton existed. Instead, what made up the body seemed to be a pale fleshy mass laced with a pattern of black marks strewn across the entire specimen. 

It reached my stomach and made a straight beeline for my face. I tried as hard as I could to hold my head back and keep it as far away as possible, but it was futile. All the while, the back half of it had just crossed over the far bed frame.

My eyes watered as it slowly crawled over my neck and made contact with my chin, its long antennas now taking up a good chunk of my vision. I didn't seem to be wearing my mask anymore. I don't know when it disappeared, but it was missing, which gave that thing the opportunity to reach between my lips with its little front legs and slowly pry open my mouth with a strength I wouldn't believe it had. 

I tried again in vain to turn my head to do *something* to counteract it, but nothing worked. The only movements I made were the spastic twitches of my muscles as I shook like a leaf. 

Once the creature had opened my mouth just enough, I gagged as it slowly began to crawl its way inside; I felt every movement of the tiny bug limbs creeping on my tongue, the fleshy mass slowly rubbing against the top of my mouth. I wanted to throw up so badly, to cough, but for some reason, those reflexes weren't working; all I could do was gag over and over again as its long, segmented body maneuvered its way in like a snake shedding its skin.

The head reached the back of my throat and began to work its way up towards the top of my skull. As I watched more and more of its body disappear behind my lips, I heard the sound, and then saw more and more of these creatures. Smaller ones began to appear at the sides of the bed and weaved their way towards me. Some crawled toward my face; others maneuvered themselves across every square inch of my body. 

I tried to scream, but nothing came out. I began hyperventilating, looking at the scene in front of me with terror; each time I looked, there were more and more, appearing out of thin air, exploring every little nook and cranny of me. A pounding, throbbing headache ensued, and above all that I felt the original parasite continue to crawl its way around in my brain faster than it ever had before.

I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for the nightmare to end.

After what felt like forever, the lights above me blared to life, and I launched out of the bed and let out a shriek as I flailed my arms around. I nearly smacked the hand of the anesthesiologist dead on as she immediately grabbed hold of my shoulders, trying to ease me back into the bed.

“Easy… easy…” she said.

I wanted to yell at her, but then I realized… everything I had just seen, all those bugs… those *creatures.* They were gone. It was just me and the doctors in an operating room with a highly rapid heartbeat monitor. 

I took a second to collect my bearings and looked at the mask sitting on the bedside table; they had taken me off the medication. 

I instantly collapsed into tears and begged for my mother.

""We're going to have to try something else…"" one doctor said, ""Removing it isn't going to work if we can't get him under."" 

I nearly tackled my mom when I saw her again and explained everything about my horrible experience in that operating room. 

Dr. Jones came in a couple of minutes later, with a grim expression. ""Okay, Kevin…I am sorry about what you just went through. For now, we've decided that we're going to try and give you some anti-parasitic medication and see if that will help your condition. I hate to tell you this, but the medical staff is… a little lost right now because you've been infected with a species we've never seen before, so we'll call in some researchers to better understand your condition. 

My mother immediately stood up in protest. “You are *not* going to run experiments on my son!”

Dr. Jones simply looked at her with professionalism. ""They aren't experiments, ma'am… we're just going to study the best course of action to hopefully kill or get this parasite out of him. And besides, it's Kevin's choice…""

They both looked at me, and I sighed. I desperately wanted this as far away from me as humanly possible, and so, with nothing left to lose, I accepted. 

The next seven days, my condition didn't get much better. I had been awake for thirteen days at this point. But it was weird because despite how horrible I felt, I still didn’t feel the need to sleep. I still felt just as awake as when this whole thing had begun, and at this point, I had resigned myself to not feeling sleepy ever again until this was over. 

I requested to spend my nights with my mother because, after my surgery encounter, I didn't want to be lying in my room alone at night, and the presence of my mother helped put me at ease. She even taught me to laugh about it all a little, and as time went on, mysteriously, the hallucinations became slightly more diluted, something which the researchers quickly picked up on.

Oh yeah, at this point, I was also being watched by a team of them 24/7. I was doing constant tests, scans, the whole deal.

The anti-parasitics they were trying seemed to have no effect. I guess that was to be expected.

The next day, one of the researchers came in and told me he had an idea. My symptoms seemed to calm down when I was at a state of ease and flare up when I was stressed or scared so he proposed giving me a high dose of a medication that's supposed to regulate my stress hormones. 

I tried it for two days, and the scientists' theories were all but confirmed because my hallucinations and all my other symptoms weakened significantly. A subsequent CT scan revealed the thing had grown much smaller than it had been before… it was starving. This is what led to the current theory that the parasite likely feeds off of stress hormones or other things your body produces during these periods. 

They continued this pattern for the next two days until my symptoms became so mild they almost didn't exist anymore. I was still stuck awake, but everything else had been diluted to an absolute minimum; the parasite on the CT scan looked like a shriveled husk of what it used to be. 

Dr. Jones came into the room that day and delivered a message that almost made my stomach drop. He said that, if possible, he would like to try the surgery again, given the thing had gotten so weak that the researchers didn't think it could overpower the anesthesia as it had before. 

I halted for a moment; on the one hand, I was eager to be done with this, but on the other… I didn't want to relive what I had. Dr. Jones assured me that they would be starting with a very low dose, and if they didn't notice an effect, they would immediately call off the operation. 

After a long debate between my mom and the doctors, we decided to proceed. 

Thankfully, the surgery went off without a hitch. 

When I came to, I finally saw the thing that had caused me all this trouble with my own eyes; it was dead, lying on the bedside table fully stretched out. It looked the same as what I had seen in my hallucinations, albeit a lot smaller. 

I even got to name the damn thing. ‘Neural Sleep Parasite’ had an excellent ring to it. Before long, they hauled off that monster for further study, and I never saw it again. 

They explained to me that I had most likely ingested its eggs when drinking that coffee back in the library, and that, combined with the high-stress response, allowed it to sort of take over my brain for a while. 

But I cut them off. I didn't want to hear more about this. I was done. 

I was released from the hospital a few hours later, got into my car, and drove back to my apartment with my mom. I know you will say I probably should have let her drive, but after all this, I was so eager to get back to a normal life. 

However, I regretted it very soon because the past eighteen days of no sleep hit like a truck in the middle of the journey. Without the parasite continuously stimulating my body, I needed to sleep again, and now my brain was about to demand I pay up the tab. 

Without realizing it, I began to doze off at the wheel in seconds and drifted into an oncoming lane. A shrill scream from my mom sitting next to me was the only thing that stopped us from slamming into a massive 18-wheeler with a combined speed of 140mph. 

I ripped the car back to the proper lane, adrenaline surging through my body. I immediately pulled over and let my mom take the wheel, realizing my stupid mistake. It goes without saying she drove me home the rest of the way.

Upon arriving at my apartment, I immediately made plans to dive into bed. It was time to catch up on those eighteen days of lost sleep. 

Or so I thought. 

Because immediately after I jumped under the covers… my tiredness… vanished… 

I began to panic but forced myself to think clearly. 

They said I ingested its eggs with that coffee… what if there was more than one… or what if it had laid more while it was inside me? Come to think of it, those odd black spheres coming out of me all the time were… unsettling; I just never thought to bring it up because there was always something else of critical importance happening…

She wanted it all gone.

The fire was doing her a favour, it was like a spotlight. 

Poppy stepped closer. The heat undid her heatless curls. Will her curls untangle? She didn’t even wear heat protection. Oh well. 

She stepped even closer. Peeling her makeup off, peeling everything she’d put on that morning. She felt lighter with each flake, flying alongside the fire’s sparks, like the fire was melting every fake smile she’d ever masqueraded herself with. 
Behind her, the world watched her step closer into the ashes which would suffocate them. But she’s not like them.

She’s not like them anymore.

She finally grabbed her coffee, and fled her house.

Whilst I have felt a bit off illness wise (a itchy/scratchy throat, headaches every now and again) which I think is all part of the healing process I feel I have been doing OK! Definitely not grumpy, minimal cravings for a vape and I'm so happy in that I think I'm slowly ""disconnecting"" the whole coffee vape, food vape, playing games vape in that I'm not craving it after each of these activities anymore which almost feels a bit... freeing!

I think I may have been a heavy vaper, started 5 years or so ago and by the time I quit I was using disposables and getting through a ""9000"" puff every 5 days or so with a strength of 5%. Not sure whether the internet is correct but it says that was the equivalent of 60 cigs a day???

Anyway - using the NRT patches I started with the 25mg/16 hr as that was what the pharmacist advised... that still seems super high but I gather it is much much less than the amount of nicotine I was having before. The pack themselves say 6-8 weeks on this patch then 2 weeks on the second lowest before 2 weeks on the lowest then stop. 

Is it safe to speed this up as I feel I am doing OK? Or better not to risk it? I got a pack of 28, so I was thinking at the very least doing those 28, then going to the next lowest for a week followed by the last for week. 

I'm a bit torn between just wanting to completely get off the stuff (although I'm happy I haven't vaped in over a week or really want to it feels like I am cheating, even though I'm not and this is probably stopping me from being a monster ha) to also not ruining a good thing I have started by rushing myself.

I did pass my first major test I feel on Friday... a night out drinking with friends, who are vapers, and I didn't ask nor try a vape or even have a wanting to! 

After doing a research on what nicotine can do to you - including your stomach and even circulation, which makes a bit of sense for me, it has only renewed my enthusiasm for getting off the stuff asap.

1pgtr8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pgtr8r/the_barn_is_starting_to_smell_rotten/,The barn is starting to smell rotten,"I'm a freshly graduated college student, with a fancy and proper degree in Agricultural science, heading back to support my family with new ideas and statistically backed theories.See, my family has a large ranch in the rolling plains of Arkansas. It's about 70 acres of fertile fields, green but kept trimmed. The far edge of the property fades into something dead and yellow, frayed branches like they'd been on fire years ago. Me and my cousins always dared each other to go beyond our familiar fields as kids, growing more bold as we got older, but never crossing the threshold.

That was forever ago, before I left them to become the first in my family with a degree. We've always had a tight-knit bond, a farm family cliche, generations living under one roof. I had met  my grandfather at the local airport, an almost entirely wooden structure hidden up in the mountains. With a rolling suitcase sliding behind me, I searched the few reuniting families in the arrival section, my eyes landing on him. It had only been four years since I'd seen him last, but farmers don't exactly age gracefully. What I mean is- the sun and experience weighed down on his face, making his eyes sink into his cheeks, wrinkled yet hollow. His skin was like leather, tanned and thick enough to dull a nail. Whisps of gray hair attempted to bridge the gaps on his scalp, like desperately holding back my family's curse of balding.

Still, it was Grandpa Harvey. Even with the years showing on his face, below those sunken eyes was a typical tight-lipped smile, happy to see me. I jogged awkwardly to his side, where he placed his hand on my shoulder with a few stiff pats.

""Good to see you, boy."" His voice drawled, loud and thick, trained from his life of calling cattle and barking orders.

""How's the family? Still.. farmy?"" I replied awkwardly, offering a thrawn smile, feeling a little distant despite weekly telephone calls with updates on how business and family were going. Southerners have a way of making you feel real welcome, while excluding you from some inside situation you couldn't puzzle together- and I was feeling more of the ladder.

""Yaw, what else would we be up to?"" He chortled loudly. I could feel the vibrato in his voice from the proximity. I kept my smile as he guided my shoulder by his bony hand, dappled with freckles and sunspots. 

He was a lot skinnier than he had been, no longer plump from living off the land- his bones rattled when he walked with an unsteady gait. I couldn't help but cringe slightly as he stifled a wheeze when we descended the stairs into the lobby entrance. We exited the building into warm, summer weather, welcoming and stuffy with humidity. The higher the elevation, the more the air seemed to weigh on your lungs, like swimming deeper into a pool. 

I didn't mind it, it was home- regardless if others considered it uncomfortable. Grandpa Harvey raised a finger, pointing at a group of well-dressed business men and cackling at the sweat beading their thin brows and high cheekbones. 

I stepped onto the sunken lip of his large red pickup, hoisting myself up onto the crackling vinyl seat. He took to the driver side, a bout of a coughing fit obstructing his attempt to turn the engine over. 

It wasn't unusual to watch an older man crumple under his age- but it still felt wrong. The four years I'd been gone seemed to have accelerated his age by decades.

My concern was quickly chased away as he began driving down the mountainside, the old beatup truck rumbling over the road that descended to the valley. The years had melted away instantly as he cracked jokes and shared his gripes of old age. He got in some jabs about how, despite his age, he could still wrestle down our bulls and stallions better than any man younger.

""People now are soft. Wouldn't know a willow from a sycamore."" He claimed, with that elderly confidence you couldn't help but admire.

""But we have ideas."" I cut in, leaning my forearm on the rolled down window, soaking in the southern breeze as it whipped through my hair. He looked over for a moment, pursing his lips as if considering to argue. He looked warmer in the sunlight of the valley. Maybe it was the airport, with its sterile lights, that made him look so gaunt. He must've decided not to argue, because he waited a long moment before he spoke next.

""You must've learned a lot from schooling. I expect you'll be teaching us now, on how we're going about it all wrong."" His words were bitter, like part of him resented me for wanting to take a different path. This was dangerous, when someone older than you set a trap like this. It was a sort of bait, daring you to confirm your doubts, or express that what they interpreted was wrong. I chose the safe option, changing the subject.

""It was good. I think I can really help out now. Before, I wasn't all that useful."" I chose my words carefully, knowing the self depreciation would make him consider my opinions.

I was a skinny bastard, gangly and awkward in a family of sturdy and broad farmers. I even remember losing a wrestling match with my thirteen year old cousin, as a twenty-something year old man. My cheeks flushed slightly at the recollection, earning a jab to my shoulder, snapping me out of my thoughts.

""We're here. Welcome back home, son."" 

The doors creaked as we got out, the rusty metal trim groaning with age. The expanse of our ranch greeted me like an old friend, slightly withered. Dense thickets shadowed where proud stalks once grew. The weather had been especially dry lately, like the clouds had gotten tired of raining. It wasn't surprising- Arkansas weather often had arid summers. A record high temperature was 115⁰, back when I was a kid. The crops that year died before they could shake the winter frost.

I took a deep breath, the fresh air making my nostrils sting pleasantly. Nothing had changed much, the land stretched infinitely just as before, ending unceremoniously into the dead woods miles away, crooked trees like bones in the distance. The big red and gray barns parallel to the large ranch house were sagging from strong winds, but they still stood proud, albeit faded. An expanding horse pasture adjacent to the gray barn was occupied by gangly, scrawny mustangs. I recognized a few, we've had some since I was born. Their spines jutted from their summer coats, their skin stretched tightly and thin over their bony frames. They nosed through the tall grass, tan muzzles blending in with the sickly ferns as they searched for food.

I followed my grandfather through the winding, hoofbeaten path to the house. He climbed the wooden steps, one at a time, pausing after each one and drawing in a thick breath of air. I pulled my suitcase up over the steps after he had gotten up to the wide porch. I was thankful I hardly had luggage- I think any more weight would cause the unreliable steps to splinter and give way to the dry dirt below. 

The door swung open, the person I had missed most hurrying onto the unsteady wood to pull me into her arms. 

""Oh! Oh, you're here! You're here with us!"" Cried my mother, her honey blonde curls of hair bouncing as she squeezed and swayed me in her arms. 

""It was only a few years, mam."" I flushed slightly, trying not to melt into her warm embrace and freckled skin. A few squeaky voices barked greetings, the bright blue and green eyes of my cousins peeking from the house. I was the oldest, and I could see the pride in their eyes- someone bigger than them had accomplished something, even if they didn't understand what. 

""Can a mother miss her boy? Oh, those years took decades!"" She cried once more, her hazel eyes wet with tears of relief that I had made it back. 

I never understood mother's, they treated anytime you went out like it was some death defying mission you may not come back from. But still, it was nice to know I had been kept in their thoughts. She went on about how they had prayed and missed me at the dinner table, rambling over herself before I could speak. 

Harvey took the handle of my suitcase in his thin hand before I could argue, herding me into the house behind my mother. 

The next few hours felt warm, comfortable. I had almost forgotten about my questions about the farm until we all sat at the dinner table. Me, a dozen cousins, my mother, and my grandfather. Conversation started out casually, my mother asked how college had been, if I'd been eating well. I answered everything with a ""Yes'm."" or a ""No mam."" I noticed missing seats at the table, and I interrupted myself mid college anecdote.

""Aunt Sarah, Uncle Smith. Are they in town?"" I gestured towards the empty chairs, my words muffled around a spoon full of shepherd's pie.

The excited chatter of the room dimmed down, until all eyes were on me. The youngest of the cousins, 6 and 8, kept talking, until they were hushed with a stroke on the head and a stern look.

My grandfather was the only one who didn't look up. His pools of dark blue eyes were trained on his plate as he chewed quietly on his food, like a cow focusing on digesting cud. My mother gave him a knowing smile, her soft and pink hand resting upon his. Her thumb stroked his bony knuckles.

""Now, that isn't something to worry about. They're around here somewhere."" Her words were smooth and carefully chosen. She spoke like she was comforting a kid over a dead goldfish- not quite lying, not admitting truth. It was just sleeping, floating on its back at the surface.

I sensed how thick the air had become, and I nodded instead of prying further. My aunt and uncle always took their time, making sure the animals were fed and put up before night. They must have been leading the horses back into their barn. The pasture became dangerous at night- coyotes and other nocturnal hunters had scaled the fences before, and they'd gone after the years foals or calves before, too. Keeping the animals up was the most responsible course of action- and they cared about the animals a great deal.

Dinner resumed after my mother reassured me, but it was quieter than before, like we were all dancing around my questions. Another southern thing was a sort of hush that followed after someone said something they shouldn't have. Everyone was too stern to be vulnerable, so we left it alone. 

My mother put the younger kids to bed that night, without the help of my aunt. They were rowdy and bubbling with questions for me, but she managed to bribe them with promises of extra pie before bed. The large house was quiet now, the main cause of noise finally settled for the night.

She emerged once more, closing the wooden door of a bedroom behind her softly. She padded over to me, her body hugged by a silky blush colored robe. I was sitting at the table still, across from my grandfather as we soaked in the comfortable silence together. He nursed a beer, tapping his fingers against the glass as I studied the darkening land through the kitchen window. The barns seemed ominous now, looming over the pastures and casting great shadows on the dry grass. The entire land seemed withered. I knew it was full of life, a dozen horses, chickens and cows slept in their stalls- but it all felt empty, like a graveyard in the winter.

She joined us at the table, a sad smile on her face as she studied me and stroked my hair absentmindedly. We remained quiet, until the sound of a wooden chair scraping over the floor startled us. Harvey got up to his unsteady feet, his beer forgotten. His face seemed sunken in the dim kitchen light.

""I'm turnin’ in. Welcome back, Mason.” He touched my shoulder meaningfully, his gaze like he was looking within me, not at me. He lingered for a moment, until I made eye contact, and then he smiled in his tight way and strode down the hallway, to the last door on the wall. It unsettled me, how empty his eyes were. I waited until I heard it close behind him, until I looked at my mom with a silent urgency.

“Sarah n’ Smith still isn't in..” I started, watching my mother's face fall, her grip tightening on my hair for a moment painfully, until she stepped aside. She paused, looking out of the window with her back to me, hands clasped behind her. I swallowed thickly, waiting for a reply as I set my hair back in place.

“It'll be okay.” She said, in a hurried whisper. For a second, in the moonlight dappled reflection, I swear I could see tears. I was pushing her past a level of numbness she must've learned while I was away. And I kept going.

“And pa. He isn't right either. He's skinny. And the horses, too. I saw a lame mare collapse under her own weight. The crops don't look good. The grass is yellow.” I kept going, listing everything I'd noticed in the short time I was back. Once the last word had left my mouth, I knew I should've let it be.

“Mason.” 

She stopped me before I went farther. Her voice was sharp, scolding. I looked up to see her eyes, tears streaming down her cheeks now. She was shaking with something between fury and sorrow. Then her voice shook like the Earth before a storm.

“Do not let them hear you.” She whispered, wiping her eyes until they were raw. She sniffled, replacing her frown with a forced smile to ease the sudden fear I felt. 

“Mason.” She repeated, squeezing my shoulder. “Get some sleep and we can find something nice to do tomorrow. Maybe we can saddle up a horse and take the trails.” Her voice was wavering, her lips shaking from a smile to a frown. 

“That's a good idea, mam.” 

Once I gave a satisfying response, she released my shoulder and walked off, looking once over her shoulder to me with something unreadable, before disappearing down the hall.

I felt uneasy, like something big was hanging over the farm, and everyone could see it but me. 

I counted it up to being lingering jetlag from my earlier flight out of college, a long travel time from Texas. Home always looks different after a long trip, afterall. 

I got into bed, a shared room toward the back of the house with a bunk bed and one normal cot. Two of my older cousins slept on the bunk, and I took the larger bed. The mattress was soft and I sunk into it, my back cradled by the comfortable foam. There was a space between the beds, where a large window sat on the wall, underneath it a small end table with books and paper stacked on it. The moonlight showed a grid on the wooden floor, keeping me awake. In college, my dorm was completely dark with black out curtains, I hadn't had light when sleeping in awhile.

It was very quiet, I could hear my own breathing and the soft snoring of my cousins across the room. A cricket chirped rhythmically for a moment, and then stopped. I counted five chirps, hoping it would maybe lull me to sleep. 

At some point, my eyes were too heavy to keep open, and I fell into a light and restless sleep. It didn't last long, when I woke in the middle of the night, the moon was still just as high in the sky. I tore the quilt off of my legs, deciding I could use some fresh air, and the sealed window wasn't providing it.

I walked slowly and methodically, remembering the least creaky steps to take in order to let everyone else sleep. I made it out quietly, bare feet stepping onto the cool wooden porch. The air was warm and dry, with a cool breeze sifting through. I took a deep breath, welcoming the sweet wind into my lungs.

I smelled something other than the cool night air and grass. Something sweet and wrong, like rotten apples. I didn't bother to slip on boots- the land was too dry and dusty for me to consider it. It's not like I would step in any mud. I stepped down from the porch, and my feet kicked up a small cloud of dust as I walked. The ground was dry and my footsteps hardly made a sound.

Even in the dark, I knew my way to the big, peeling red barn. I could walk the path deaf blind or dazed. I reached the large doors, slightly ajar. The smell was worse now. It assaulted my nose, made my eyes water and my sinuses tingle. It was the kind of sweet, putrid smell that you wanted to huff more of, just to figure out the source. Like old meat.

I pushed open the door with a deafening creak- and what I saw next- I still see when I close my eyes. Flies and other insects who fed on rot scattered at the sudden moonlight, darting past me. I swatted them away frantically, stepping forward as my stomach gurgled.

 I found Aunt Sarah.

What was left of her. The face down body of a woman, wearing a long pleated skirt and work shirt. I would recognize the outfit anywhere- she always wore it when working outside. Her blonde hair was a matted mess on the back of her head. Something between muck and blood oozed beneath her, a rich brown and red color that caked the straw bedding of the floor. It spread through and touched my bare feet with a sickening slosh, like stepping in a mud puddle. She was rotten, for weeks by the smell of it. Her arm stretched out beneath her, the flesh was wrinkled and thin, with flies scattering to pick it over

I couldn't breath, couldn't blink, couldn't move. The next part happened so fast. Something lurched in the darkness, like something wet being dragged across grass. It would pause, then continue. I took one step back, the gore squishing between my toes. It got closer, faster and more determined. I saw a hand sticking out of a familiar flannel sleeve, the tan and thick hand of my uncle, calloused from working the land. The fingers bent, digging into the straw for grip and using the leverage to pull his body further. He wasn't alive. But he moved. He moved like a parasite was controlling him, not like a zombie. He wasn't aware, I could tell. I could tell by the vacant look in his eyes, glazed over and almost entirely white. His mouth hung open, collecting straw as he was dragged.

I remembered something like this- a fungus that possessed ants to exist without consciousness. Like it was something determined, not sure of what. Something hungry.

A scream caught in my throat, something strangled and burning. My feet finally moved without my brain's permission, taking me out of the barn. They pounded against the Earth, taking me back to the house as I continued my guttural wail. I clambered up the porch and shoved the door open, my feet staining the wooden floor. I didn't look back, but I could still hear the wet dragging.

My mother must've heard the sudden commotion, because she emerged from her room, her eyes sullen and too indifferent. I couldn't find the right words, so I just banged my fist on the door frame, pointing outside to the barn. 

She walked forward, slow calm strides that made my stomach turn upside-down. 

“Mason. Were you out with Aunt Sarah and Uncle Smith?” She asked, pursing her lips, almost accusatory.

My words came out fast and hurried. “Mom! They- they're dead. They're dead and they didn't stay dead!”

She put a hand on my shoulder, turning me away from my nightmares, facing the kitchen window. She turned my head with her soft hand on my cheek, making me look out of it, to the woods stretching beyond.

“Mason. The woods are hungry. They've gotten real restless since you've been gone.” She sucked in her cheeks, her hand tightening on my arm. The woods did seem darker than before, like they were eating up our green land and turning it yellow and black. Dead. 

“What?” I asked in a whisper, like I was afraid to know the answer.

The answer came quietly, over the next few hours. She sat with me at the table. She had started a pot of coffee before she sat down, now holding a warm mug between her hands. I had been holding my breath the entire time, but I was grateful the scent of death was replaced with bitter coffee. 

“Now, that's better.” She muttered quietly to herself, taking a noisy sip of the coffee. “I guess it all started the day you left. We were happy for you, but sad. And we didn't keep up our duty.”

“Duty?” 

“Yes, boy. I know you're a smart boy, you've noticed the woods ever since you were young.” She put her hand over mine and rubbed her thumb over it in a gesture of comfort. “You noticed how they stretch out and reach for you. They're a living thing, in a decayed way. They get hungry. We feed them, whatever weak animals we get during spring. In exchange, we get to live off the land.”

I nodded despite not understanding any of it.

This was her sign to continue. “It's been a real dry season. We haven't had much crops to sell, much cows having calves. It's been.. incessant. It stopped taking the weak stillborn foals, and started feeding off our mares. Then the stallions. Then our bulls. And it still wasn't enough..” She paused, letting me fill in the blanks. That explained what happened to her brother and sister.

“That's why grandpa looks so sick.” I assumed, and she nodded gravely.

“Thats right. He's been working over time, trying to save the animals from the sickness. So much so it's got him sick himself.” She looked at me then, and I felt my stomach drop.

“Your cousins are too young to understand. But we're putting them up, somewhere else that's safe. I'll be going with them up North. Your grandfather is sick, Mason. The farm is sick.” She leaned forward, and her tone became pleading.

“You're strong, smart, a real survivor..Like your grandfather. Please, Mason. Please stay and fight the darkness. Feed it. Keep it at bay.”

It was quiet after that. I thought for an eternity, replied in a few seconds.

“I'll keep it away, mom.”

The years went by fast, after I had been tasked with something so heavy. My mother took the youngest of my cousins and moved up North to a small town home, like she said. The older ones went off on their own to school, inspired by my own journey. Grandpa Harvey passed away a few years back, peacefully in his sleep. When the weight was off his shoulders.

And me? Well, I'm in my fifties now. I had my own family with a woman who understood what my duty was. Had kids who had their own kids. I even had a grandson who agreed to take my place.

I got a fancy laptop this Christmas, and my grandkids introduced me to this site, said I should write my story.

I'm sitting on the porch now, the computer in my lap as I type. The woods beyond crept closer by the day, but I kept them in check. I have a cigarette in my lips, my eyes on them. I take a drag as something dark drags the body of a stillborn foal out of sight.

Every 2-3 weeks I’d have a debilitating migraine lasting 1-3 days. It was really bad and would put me at risk of falling behind at work causing me to have to work hard on the weekends always just in case I’d get a migraine during the week.

Recently I made an app that scans ingredient labels and shows you scientific literature about each ingredient to warn of the risks. The real issue this is meant to tackle is avoiding negative side effects from the products you use. 

This led me to expand the utility to be a conversational symptom tracker. I used this tracker while I was building it and it led me to find out that it was TYRAMINE sensitivity that was causing everything. I am really happy and proud to say I haven’t had a migraine in a long time now. 

This feature is still unreleased but you can help it work for yourself and others by downloading the app and sending me a chat so I can enable the features for you. I’ll make sure to follow up and build/change things to suit your needs!

From that moment on, Mitchell and I became mortal enemies.
He drove a car straight into my father’s funeral.
I smashed his mother’s urn on the dock and scattered her ashes into the sea.
Our hatred consumed us, sharp and venomous. We spent ten years wounding each other until we finally wore ourselves out.
He took his crew and left for Mexico.
I stayed in New York and became the city's most sought-after bounty hunter.
But when we met again years later, he was neither my enemy nor the boy I once knew.
He walked into the morgue—into the room where I was lying.
Years later, we finally got the chance to faced each other in silence.

After finishing my job, I hurried back to the small bakery I used as a front to tend to my injuries.
The wall-mounted TV showed Mitchell Harvey's return.
The former golden boy of New York's elite circles, now Mexico's top arms dealer, was back in town. Of course, it was headline news.
I roughly bandaged my wound and moved toward the small memorial corner I kept for my father.
Suddenly, a girl with chin-length hair burst into the shop.
She looked serious but spoke loudly. Clutching red roses, she pointed at the display case. ""I'll take everything here!""
Close behind was Roderick Dunlap, Mitchell's best friend and right-hand man.
When he saw me, he froze, his expression tightening. ""Yas, maybe we should go somewhere else?""
The girl refused immediately. ""No way!
""I brought Mitch desserts from here before. He said they were amazing. It's his birthday today. I need to get more.""
She gave me a pleading look. ""Ma'am, my fiancé's returning today. He loves your pastries. Could I use your space for a birthday surprise?""
I couldn't refuse, so I nodded.
""Could we get some extra desserts?"" she asked.
I agreed, noticing my fresh bandage was already bleeding through.
I hid my hand under my apron and walked unsteadily toward the kitchen.
It wasn't fear or nostalgia.
My illness was flaring up again.
It was incurable.
""Roderick, we're running out of time! Help me set up! Mitch's gonna be here any minute, and I want everything perfect.""
Roderick didn't move.
He knew Mitchell was never happy to see me.
On the news broadcast, Mitchell smiled for the cameras, yet his eyes remained cold.
""I'm sure she's watching too. I'm looking forward to... seeing her again.""

The ugly scar on my neck was his doing. He crushed a glass and used a shard to attack me.
Again, there was no deep motive.
We had a simple understanding: hurt the other, get hurt in return. We liked seeing each other in pain.
The news anchor smiled suggestively. ""Planning a long stay, Mr. Harvey? Those roses... Are you meeting someone special?""
He paused, his voice low. ""My fiancée.""
In the shop, the girl was adjusting roses in a candelabra. She glanced up at the TV.
""Roderick,"" she said, ""I heard Mitch had some messy history with a girl here for ten years. You know anything about that?""
I kept my head down, polishing a knife, but felt Roderick's gaze flicker toward me.
""Mitch!"" Her shout cut through the tension.
She forgot her umbrella and dashed outside.
""Yas.""
Mitchell caught her in a one-armed hug, his umbrella shielding her from the rain.
She rose on her toes and pressed a quick, rain-damp kiss to his lips.
I thought I saw him lean back, just slightly.
Then his eyes found mine through the wet glass.
The girl tried to turn, but he cupped her chin and kissed her again, deeper this time.
I looked away and snipped the ribbon I was holding.
Roderick approached.
""Paulette,"" he said, voice low. ""It's his birthday. For one night, could you just not anger him?""
He hesitated, seeming to think of something. ""She's nineteen. Clean slate. Reminds him of you before.""
I nodded, my fingers feeling numb.
""She's pretty. Prettier than I was.""
The door opened. Mitchell stood there, folding his black umbrella.
""Discussing my fiancée?""
His tone was light, but his stare was cold as it rested on me.
 
###Chapter 3
Roderick watched me, holding his breath.
He was waiting for one of my classic outbursts.
Instead, I simply pushed the boxed cake toward them. ""Your dark chocolate cheesecake.""
Yasmine Murphy gazed at Mitchell with adoration. ""Try it, Mitch. Is this your favorite?""
He took a sip of coffee, rubbing the edge of the cup, before cutting a small piece with the silver dessert fork.
""Bitter. Unpleasantly so. Not for me.""
His tone was light, his eyes smiling as he teased Yasmine.
She looked confused and took a bite herself. ""It's delicious! You're lying to me again!""
She didn't see that his gaze remained fixed on me over her head.
Suddenly, the door chime jangled loudly.
""Hey, Mitch! Welcome back!""
A few men crowded in, their laughter cutting off abruptly when they saw me.
Their eyes followed me, wary and questioning, before turning to Roderick.
I carried over the pot of lemonade. The men flinched in unison, raising their hands defensively, as if I were holding acid.
Back when Mitchell and I were at each other's throats, his crew got caught in the crossfire a few times.
It was never anything serious, just minor incidents. I was surprised they still reacted this way.
Someone nudged Roderick. ""Roddy, what's she doing here?""
Roderick just shrugged, not explaining.
""Enjoy your lemonade,"" I said, turning to leave.
Yasmine caught my wrist. ""Wait! Could you take a picture for us?""
""No,"" I said, calmly removing her hand.
I'd only taken a few steps when a figure moved to block my path.
I looked up to see Mitchell's gloomy face. ""I know how this works,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Everything has a price. So name it. How much to get you to...""
He paused deliberately, waiting for me to react. When I didn't, he finished coldly. ""Take a picture for us.""
I looked him over and tried to step around him.
A sharp pressure on a nerve in my arm sent a jolt of pain through me, and my legs gave way. I fell to my knees. A black card was flung down, its edge catching my cheek and drawing a thin line of blood.
""That's more than enough to make you disappear.""
I pushed myself back to my feet, my fingers gingerly touching the cut, my eyes fixed on Mitchell.
Yasmine quickly stepped between us, her smile strained. ""Mitch, stop it, okay?
""Sorry, miss. He must have had too much to drink.""
But he didn't smell of alcohol. He was simply picking a fight, same as always.
It convinced me he'd been having such a good time abroad that he'd forgotten who he was dealing with.
I bent down, picked up the black card, and stood facing him again.
His friends let out a low laugh.
""Some things never change. She still jumps for money.""
He held out his phone with a confident smirk, pleased by my apparent cooperation.
I moved fast. I grabbed his jaw, scraped the edge of the card through a thick glob of chocolate frosting, and shoved it into his mouth.
I didn't stop until I smelled blood. Then I grabbed two glasses from the table and poured the liquor down his throat.
""Consider your mouth cleaned,"" I said.
I turned and slapped the man who had spoken. ""Learn when to keep quiet.""
The whole thing was over in seconds. No one else moved. The only sound was the rain hitting the windows.
Roderick, leaning against the far wall, drained his glass and sighed heavily. ""I told you not to provoke her.""
Yasmine finally snapped out of her shock, her posture defensive as she confronted me. ""We were out of line first. I get it. But this is just insane!""
She raised her hand to strike me.
""Ah!"" I caught her wrist mid-swing and slapped her, hard, across the face.
The sound was sharp in the quiet room.
Mitchell spat out a mix of blood and frosting, a cold smile on his lips. ""You want a fight with me? Fine. But you can't touch her.""
He pulled the sobbing Yasmine close, her cheek still swollen from the slap. ""How about I trash this place for you? Will that make you feel better?""
She nodded and covered her cheek, tears in her eyes.
His bodyguards in black swarmed in. Clubs swung down, shattering glass and smashing the overhead light.
Cold wind and rain blew through the broken windows, soaking my face.
Mitchell gripped my chin, forcing my head up.
""You didn't start this. But she needs to see it end. Send me the bill for the damages. All of it.""
His eyes scanned me like I was a piece of discarded furniture.
I shoved his hand away, a sudden coughing fit seizing me. I frantically searched through the wreckage.
A small white prescription bottle rolled into view. My eyes locked onto it.
He was faster. He bent down and plucked it, reading the label.
""Six of these at once? Are you trying to kill yourself?""
He tossed the bottle into a rainwater puddle, put his arm around Yasmine, and walked away.
I knelt by the puddle, retrieved the bottle, and swallowed two more pills.
This medication was for anxiety and pain.
I started with half a pill. Now, eight couldn't stop my pain.
The pills were nearly gone. And so was I.
 
###Chapter 4
Three years passed, and my mother died too.
My work was unstable. I'd taken many lives and become a target myself.
I'd spent all my savings on that bakery. Now, with it destroyed, I had nowhere left to go.
Maybe it was the pain seizing my limbs again, but I lacked the strength to move. I simply sat amidst the wreckage, letting the rain soak me.
Overnight, every major tabloid in New York led with ""Mitchell Harvey Returns to Wreak Havoc on His Ex.""
By sunrise, I was ready to leave.
Before going, I faced the shattered ruins and slowly bowed.
Mitchell appeared out of nowhere. He hauled me to my feet with one hand.
""It's just a bakery. Is it worth this?""
I slapped his hand away, steadied myself, and then struck him three sharp slaps across the face.
""My parents' memorial plaques were inside. They're gone now,"" I said, my voice flat. ""The bow was necessary.""
He worked his jaw, then smirked. ""Three slaps for your mother's memorial? Sounds like I got the better deal.""
I ignored him, staring at the devastation.
He stood behind me, deliberately twisting the knife.
""Paulette Sherman. I'm talking to you.""
I acted as if I hadn't heard and walked away.
He caught up in a few strides, blocking my path.
""Stop pretending you're fine! Look at yourself. You're ghostly pale. What are you trying to prove?""
""My old condition flared up. A little tired, that's all."" I looked up, offering a cold smile. ""Mitchell, did you really think you were important enough to affect me?""
But I knew the truth.
He'd come back specifically to make my life hell.
If I were still in good health, I wouldn't mind another round, maybe breaking a few of his bones in the process.
But now, just standing upright consumed all my energy.
In the hospital, the smell of disinfectant was nauseating.
Several doctors studied my scans, their expressions grim.
""How much of your last prescription is left?""
""It's gone.""
""Gone?!"" Steven Harriman's voice rose sharply. ""That was a three-month supply! It's only been a week!""
Steven had handled my case for years. His hesitation told me everything—my time was running out.
""Is... there anyone else in your family?"" he asked carefully.
""Have you forgotten?"" My tone was flat. ""My father's dead. My mother's gone. It's just me.""
He removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""You were managing well for three years. What happened this past week...""
My phone screen lit up with a news alert—a prominent photo of Mitchell with Yasmine on his arm at some gala.
The person I thought I was over still hurt me the most.
Mitchell was the source of my deepest wounds, the one who knew how to hurt me most without leaving a mark.
""Your condition is extremely unstable. After stopping the medication, the first week, the first month, and the third month are all critical periods.
""Take this,"" he said, handing me a small bottle. His voice was heavy. ""Three pills when the pain is severe. No more than three.""
Before he finished, I'd twisted the cap off, shaken a handful into my palm, and dry-swallowed them.
The number didn't matter, as long as it dulled the bone-deep agony.
A week or three months made no difference to me.
After taking the pills, I crouched in the most inconspicuous corner of the hospital corridor, my back pressed against the cold wall.
I'd figured out that lowering my body temperature could ease the pain.
Cold sweat soaked through my thin clothes.
For ten minutes, I listened to the desperate prayers and weeping outside the operating room, where all hope hung on a single, fragile thread.
""Mommy, isn't that the lady who was in the bed next to us? Should we say goodbye?""
""Her illness... There's no cure. Let's not bother her. Such a tragic case. No family left, and such a severe sickness. She probably won't even have anyone to hold a funeral for her.""
The little girl looked up, confused. ""But surely someone in the world cares about her, right?""
I blinked hard, clearing my blurred vision, and focused on my phone screen.
A text came from Mitchell.
He'd been messaging since last night, persistently asking what compensation I wanted.
I thought about it. Maybe no one cared, but there was one person who could handle the funeral arrangements.
I dialed the number I knew by heart.
He answered instantly.
""Made up your mind?""
I took a sharp breath, swallowing the metallic taste in my mouth. ""If you insist on paying me back, Mitchell, you can be the one to bury me.""
 
###Chapter 5
Silence stretched for seconds on the other end, followed by Mitchell's mocking laugh.
""Paulette, someone as vicious and stubborn as you usually lives forever. But if you do somehow die before me, rest assured, I'll give you the most lavish funeral New York has ever seen. I'll have the whole city light memorial candles for you!""
Satisfied with his promise, I hung up.
Outside the hospital, I saw the mother and daughter again.
The little girl was pounding her chest, her voice full of childish conviction. ""Who says nobody cares about her just because she has no family? Well, I do!""
""Enough, let's go. The bus is. Oh, the bus!"" Her mother pulled her away, rushing for the departing bus.
I walked to the parking garage and got into my black sedan.
Seeing they'd missed the bus, I impulsively rolled down the window. ""Get in. I'll give you a ride.""
I dropped them off downtown. They thanked me profusely and got out.
Just as I was about to pull away, I heard an irritating voice.
""Well, look at that. Paulette did a good deed. I suppose even you need to score some points.""
Mitchell's usual crowd was exiting a nearby club. Yasmine clung to his arm, her gaze sharp and venomous.
I didn't want a scene. I started raising the window to leave.
But Yasmine hurried over and pressed her hand against the glass.
A fake smile played on her lips, but her eyes were cold. ""I just found out about your history with Mitch. I hope we didn't... upset you yesterday?""
I had no patience for her act and tried to close the window again.
She gripped the window frame tightly. ""I have something for you. I really mean no harm.""
""I'm not interested. Get lost."" My patience was gone.
Yasmine suddenly let go. As I started the car, she pulled a small urn from her bag.
""I heard your mother's memorial plaque was destroyed in the shop. I gathered some ashes from the ruins this morning so you'd have something to remember her by.""
Her voice was sweet, but her actions were pure malice.
She reached through the window and poured the contents of the urn onto my passenger seat.
""Oh! You... you didn't catch it!"" she cried, stepping back with a perfect mask of innocence and sly satisfaction. ""You're not mad at me, are you?""
I watched her performance, and a sudden anger burned through the sickness inside me.
Good. She asked for this.
The group by the club entrance, clueless, was still praising Yasmine. ""Yas is so thoughtful, talking to that mess and even giving her a gift.""
Yasmine confidently turned and walked towards a shiny new Porsche parked ahead, triumphantly shaking her key fob.
I rolled down my window and called out, ""Yasmine! I have a gift for you, too!""
Yasmine turned, crossing her arms smugly. ""What are you giving me, Paulette?""
I tightened my seatbelt, my eyes locking on her. ""A one-way trip.""
Before the words faded, I slammed the accelerator.
""Bang!""
The front of my car smashed into the Porsche's rear.
Yasmine's car lurched forward uncontrollably.
I reversed, then slammed the gas again, hitting it a second time!
In the rearview mirror, I saw the drunken group jolt into sobriety.
""She's insane! She's actually insane!""
""I told you she was a lunatic! But you had to provoke her!""
""Relax, she won't really do anything. She's just blowing off steam, and then...""
He didn't finish.
True, I was blowing off steam.
But I wasn't done yet.
Yasmine stumbled out of the smoking car, her face pale, already slipping back into her fragile victim role.
""Mitch, wh... what did I do wrong?""
Mitchell had a cut on his forehead from flying glass, bleeding slightly. He moved urgently to shield Yasmine.
He understood my intent in a single glance.
""Paulette! Don't you dare!""
Ridiculous. There was nothing I dared not do.
I kept my eyes on Yasmine, my expression icy, and floored the accelerator.
The engine roared as the car shot straight toward her.
 
###Chapter 6
I unbuckled my seatbelt, got out, and coldly observed Yasmine sprawled on the pavement a few yards away.
Her legs and arms were scraped and bleeding.
""You're lucky I let off the gas. Otherwise, you'd have more than scratches,"" I stated calmly.
She looked up, her eyes filled with naked hatred. ""Mitchell will make you pay for this!""
I picked up my handbag from the passenger seat, now soiled with the ashes, and used its corner to lift her chin. ""There. The real you is much more tolerable.""
I took the bag back, dusting it off with disgust. The group rushed over.
Mitchell hurried to help Yasmine up.
I took out my phone, called an ambulance, then tossed the handbag toward Yasmine.
""This bag's resale value is about 20,000 dollars. More than enough for her medical bills and the car repairs.""
""Paulette!"" Mitchell's voice was thick with suppressed rage.
I ignored him and walked away.
The taste of blood filled my mouth. I pressed my lips together and quickened my pace.
I nearly ran from the scene. Rounding a corner, sure I was out of sight, I braced myself against a wall and coughed, splattering dark blood onto the grimy brick.
A ringing filled my ears, my vision blurring. I forced myself onward, moving on instinct until I reached my temporary apartment.
If my body had held up, I might have turned back to cause Mitchell more trouble. I desperately wanted to see him furious and helpless against me.
I collapsed near the living room coffee table and poured a glass of water.
But after one sip, I coughed it all back up—water and blood.
The half-glass of water instantly turned crimson.
I lay on the floor, gasping for air. It felt like an invisible hand was twisting my insides. The pain was maddening, but I lacked even the strength to clench my teeth.
I had no idea how much time had passed before the buzzing of my phone and violent pounding on my door dragged me back to consciousness.
For a moment, I'd thought I wouldn't make it through the night.
The name flashing on the screen was Mitchell.
""Paulette! Open the door! I know you're in there!""
His voice came through, threatening and absolute, while the door thumped under his force.
""If you don't open it, I'll break it down!""
I knew he meant it. But I would never let him see me like this—broken and dying.
Summoning the last of my strength, I crawled into the bedroom, moved the wardrobe, and squeezed into the narrow hiding space behind it. The sound of the door being forced open echoed from outside, followed by hurried footsteps.
His texts flooded my screen, one after another.
""Hiding? You think that works?"" ""Get out of here! We need to talk!"" ""If anything happens to Yasmine, I'll make you pay with your life!"" I stared at my phone. A sudden drop of nosebleed hit the screen, forming a dark red stain. My consciousness faded.*",1,1765141526.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

I'm a musician and prepping for a show tonight. It's times like this, I like to take an inventory.

I feel and look great. I'm an old dude, but no longer old and overweight. I'm not that vain, but who doesn't like looking good? More importantly, I feel great!  
  
I started in December of 2023. My 25yo nephew had a serious health problem that was made super complicated by his very high weight. My SIL, a doctor, talked with me about wegovy as part of his treatment plan. She encouraged me to talk with my doctor about it and I took her advice.  
  
Today, my nephew is down 250lbs and healthy. He has a nice girlfriend and a new job. He was near dead two years ago. I love my nephew and I'm super happy for his recovery. He and my sons are like brothers so no heartache for them or me.   
  
I started Wegovy almost exactly two years ago. Here's my progress. 

80 lbs down--I'm wearing my very cool, very distressed Levi's denim jacket I've had since 1984!  
  
BP: borderline before, perfect now.  
  
My stamina and energy are super. Like I'm 25 years younger--I'm 63.  
  
90% less pain in my feet, knees, hips, and back.  
  
I'm wearing my favorite pointy toed cowboy boots and not worrying about making it through the show without miserable pain.

Negatives  
Runny nose, but without inflammation and itch like allergic rhinitis. Annoying, but livable.   
Occasional nausea, but not like gastroenteritis. It's usually after my first few sips of coffee in the morning and once the wave crests, it's done.  
I have occasional mild night sweats but NBD.  
  
If it works for you, keep going!

I was able to do first 24hr with minimal discomfort. After that, it felt I can do maybe another 24hr. There were some funny tummy sounds 😄 and I was feeling slight brain fog kinda thing, don’t know what is the right word here. After 48hr, I felt I can stay for another 24hr as it didn’t feel too stressful. I had electrolytes with water , normal iodine salt +lemon juice in water, and normal water. On 2nd day I had black coffee as well. 

I just finished my fast by breaking first with some ghee/clarified butter after 30 mins I had my usual chia seeds+yogurt soaked overnight with blueberries,raspberries, blackberries, strawberries. I am next planning to have chicken and rice, made sure the ratio is more on chicken. 

This is my first time doing a 72hr fast, I just started a timer on my phone and went with it.

I am doing this majorly to cut down my fat and also get that autophagy benefits. For stats, 5’11, 186lb with about 70lb of fat tissue. I do strength training 2-3 times a week. I am planning to go hit gym tomorrow, my question is, is it ok to hit gym the next day after breaking fast? I feel I may not have that much energy to push weights?

1pgtc8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1pgtc8z/besides_drinking_what_do_you_and_your_friends/,Besides drinking… what do you and your friends actually do?,"It seems like the only thing I do with friends is eat or drink. Don’t get me wrong… I LOVE to eat and I tolerate the drinking, but I’m getting a bit bored especially when we hang out 2x or 3x a week. Bored in the lack of variety of activities, but also the mundane where it’s always an evening activity and I spend the day alone. 

I don’t want this to come across in poor taste.. I’m glad I get to see my friends multiple times a week. And I know the cause of activities is mainly because of different stages of life (dating, married) or locations (Ukrainian Village vs Lake View). I’m also content doing day time activities alone (gym, coffee, movies, hobbies)…

But I am envious of people who see their friends frequently and doing things without it being overly planned event! If you’re seeing friends even twice a week.. what are you actually doing together?",19,1765140930.0,AskChicago,30,0.86,False

When you choose to cut Visi how much time elapsed after Chase is put on life support?
when she's getting changed is it the same day or later, why is she getting changed? (besides shroud tech reveal)
Was she hanging around after coming back?
Why did she come back?

& At the end of the game when photos are being taken when she gets shot & taken in the ambulance she comes back (that's quite a bit of time that pases for the ambulance to be far away. & not when she kills Shroud but both times the Cat Mascot is there.

While I haven't really noticed them in the background that much I did just see that they are frequently in the background for gags online.

But the point I'm getting at, when someones power is invisibility how does someone be invisible & still interact with people?, a disguise

The Cat's most notible moment in the game is the Irish coffee **for** Robert, not both coffees & 50-50 if he got it.

But it's the only way I can see how she got back in time for the photos.

TL;DR is Visi Mr. Whiskey?",0,1765140918.0,DispatchAdHoc,1,0.5,False

Just got a working but slightly ‘pre-loved’ Gaggia classic for a Christmas present for my wife. I’m unsure of how it’s been looked after (or not) before. 

-How would you buff out the scratches on the top?
-What would be sensible to check and service internally to prolong its life and make great espresso?

It’s currently working but I’d like it to be in its best shape possible before I give it to her.

I’m quite practical and have tools at home but not a coffee pro. Any small easy/obvious upgrades would be nice to know too as there seems to be quite a community around this.

1. Founded and ran the websites [Hobotraveler.com](http://Hobotraveler.com) and [Everydayhobo.com](http://Everydayhobo.com) where he fleeced investors and members for thousands of dollars.
2. Organized several [Gofundme.com](http://Gofundme.com) fundraisers and took the money instead and ran.
3. Borrowed thousands of dollars from family and friends and never paid them back.

His current scams are:

1. E-Begging from Gofundme, Patreon and Buy me a coffee.
2. Welfare fraud in the USA including Section 8 housing,receiving SSI while living outside the USA and collecting food stamps.
3. Bank and credit card fraud. He opened up several bank accounts and applied for credit cards before he left the USA. He now has $17000 in credit and has no intention of paying it when does use it.
4. International travel guide scam. $4500 a day + airfare payable in advance.

All this information is online from his substack and youtube channel. That's how stupid he is.",2,1765140795.0,hobotraveler,0,1.0,False

Good evening, everyone!

I’m here to talk a little bit about what happened to me over the last few months. Prepare yourselves for a long post and a surreal story. I am ready to be judged, but my conscience is clear. I’m writing this to find some strength and seek your perspective.

I’m a guy in my early 30s (I was 30 when this started). I’ve had a few long relationships and generally never had trouble with women. As a rule, I’m fun, extroverted, and not afraid to break the ice. I can be a bit cheeky but also very gentlemanly.

So, how did this start? Let’s rewind two years. I bought a sports car and became friends with the mechanic/tuner. Everything was fine. A year later, another guy shows up at the shop with the same car, but an older model. We formed a little ""car crew""—going for drives, lunches, meets, everything a handful of car enthusiasts do.

This guy has a long-term girlfriend and a son. I’m also a father, separated, and have a daughter. One time, this guy brought his girlfriend’s friend along to a party so we could all go together with his girlfriend. We all got to know each other—we went jogging (not racing cars), to the movies, and to those typical summer parties. However, I had already noticed that this acquaintance of mine wasn’t exactly the best example of a husband or father; he was quite lazy.

Anyway, time goes by. I’m part of a camping club based in Costa da Caparica. To my surprise, one day I run into his girlfriend there. It turns out she was a friend/colleague of a ""companion"" I’ve known at the campsite for years. A quick ""Hi, what are you doing here?"" and I went about my life. I even mentioned to my acquaintance that I saw her there, knowing he was at home gaming or with their son. Another weekend, I see her again—same thing: a quick hello, and I move on. The same happened the following weekend. I wasn’t interested at all. At this point, I was casually dating several people and even had someone semi-serious.

Summer holidays arrive. We all go to the Algarve together: me, my daughter, and the three of them. We spoke respectfully, everything was cool, though I noticed he was very lazy regarding responsibilities with the kid. Anyway, after a great day, since I had seen her at the campsite before, I invited them to the last dance/party of the season at the park. Moral of the story: he said yes.

I was partly involved in organizing the party. The night went on... halfway through, I got an Instagram friend request notification. It was Her! I accepted and followed back—normal stuff. There were three DJs (one was a friend of mine), but one of the others was terrible. she started a conversation asking about the bad DJ. I barely replied when I could, until I bumped into her in the middle of the party. We made small talk, but I was with my group of friends and family, barely paying her any attention. After all, she was the girlfriend of an acquaintance/friend (though not really a close friend yet).

At the end of the night, during the slow dances/partner dances (Kizomba, etc.), I was with two girls, and they started dancing with each other. I looked up, and she was alone on the dance floor. We locked eyes and thought, ""Why not... it's just 3 minutes, no big deal."" We danced! **GRAVE MISTAKE.** Guys, the chemistry was inexplicable. There was heat in the air, a closeness, and a fit as if our bodies already knew each other.

The dance ended, and we went our separate ways. I stayed at the party and stopped seeing her. Half an hour later, I got a DM on Instagram asking where I was and if I wanted to grab a drink at her colleague's trailer... but I was still at the party. I felt suspicious... but after a dance like that, I went. I wasn't going to try anything. The drink was quick; I sensed she wasn't entirely comfortable, and that there was tension, but it couldn't happen.

The vibe died down. Sunday we met at the café—""good morning, good afternoon""—and as I was leaving, I noticed they were looking at me. Days passed, and I received a DM asking for my DJ friend's contact info for her company Christmas party. The conversation started there... but imagine this: within weeks, without anything explicit happening, we were talking from morning to night. ""Good morning,"" ""How are you,"" discussing your problems, my problems... without touching on the subject of the dance. One day we touched on it and elaborated; she pushed the boundary, I set the limit... and we went on like this for another week or two. Just banter back and forth... work problems, life problems, even problems with my acquaintance. I realized through her that they were together out of convenience, living in the house she basically set up alone... that he helps with the bills, but they’ve almost separated a few times.

We kept talking, always with some teasing involved. It started with mirror selfies, photos of the kid, daily life, whatever. Until one day, the limit was broken. A hotter photo came through... a hotter conversation... We happened to arrange a coffee. The face-to-face went super well... we talked and talked, small touches, some chemistry... always running away from it... almost a kiss at goodbye. We continued, days passing, talking 24/7. One day we all went to a concert (her, me, her colleague, and the two kids) and pretended to bump into each other. We even danced close. The next day, another party... this time I told her: ""Drop your colleague off and come meet me."" She said she would, and she did. She came, and we kissed. Honestly, at first, there was a micro-regret, **BUT THEN IT WAS EVERYTHING WE REALLY WANTED.** We drove home together in separate cars, side by side, singing and blowing kisses to each other.

At this point, the conversation continued all day, everyday. ""Good morning"" photos from the bathroom at midday, everything... things were flowing. We started seeing each other in secret. Here, a red flag appeared on my end: I started adapting too much to her routine. I’d go meet her at the supermarket, the fruit shop, take the metro just to be with her for a bit. She would only come to me late at night or when she went out without him or the son, or was coming from her parents'. One day in the back of the car, we had a heated moment... which ended up not happening fully... and she went crazy that it didn't happen. The spark reignited. She spent the whole week saying she would do this and that... another day she came to meet me to go to a motel, but he called us halfway through, and I had to turn back. I was left burning with frustration. I didn't say anything the next day, but then we spoke, the conversation flowed again... and I started pressing her, saying it was all just talk. Until one day, with my parents out of the house... she teased that she couldn't come... until she was at my door. We went **all in**. Maximum connection. Everything you can imagine fit perfectly... uninhibited foreplay. She ended up with trembling legs... again, that feeling of ""I'm so glad we did this.""

A few more days passed. I picked her up from work twice on her bad days just to be together, and every kiss was like we wanted to devour each other. One day she had surgery, and I gave her a ride while she was still groggy from anesthesia. I discovered two things:

1. I’m not the first affair in her relationship, but rather a Boss, with whom she supposedly only shared some kisses. She says she regrets it, but that he still chases her today. I told her right then: ""Look, if you have any intimate moment with your 'boyfriend' again, tell me, because I’m not into sharing, and I am not Plan B."" I showed vulnerability, and she accepted it. Time passed, it became routine to see each other on the metro. I went on a trip and brought her a magnet; I won a thermos for coffee and gave it to her—she was so happy, sending me photos drinking hot coffee ""like our love."" Actually, the first time we were together, she accidentally called me ""love"" and we laughed about it.

Time goes by, and one day we knew we both had the day off. We went to a motel. 3, 4, 5 times... again, it was too good. She was ecstatic, super satisfied. We went to lunch, took photos together at the beach. Another week passes... she tells me that in November we would have two weeks for ""us."" More sensitive topics started to arise, like ""what are we doing with this?"" I confess, some pressure came from my side... I was already falling in love. Once, we talked at the metro station about how she had tried to separate and he made her life hell, that she tried twice already. I asked her what would happen if he came with sweet talk, and she looked angry, saying she’d send him packing. I saw it in her expression.

Another week of talking normally, but we weren't seeing each other as frequently, even on the metro, because she often took her son and arrived late. Until one day, I was at a dinner with friends, and she wanted to come give me a kiss. I was far away, but close enough. I told her to come meet me. She didn't come. I countered that I had gone out of my way many times just to see her for 10-15 minutes. She said no, that she was tired. Things cooled down a bit. We saw each other again on the metro, kissed, and were happy to see each other at first, but there was tension... That day, I pressed her: ""So, what's going on?"" She said: Work problems, and her boyfriend had asked to try again. I stood firm, explaining that I wasn't Plan B and wouldn't settle for crumbs. She ended it with a ""It’s a shame because I really like you.""

After this, a week passed with no contact. We watched each other's stories, but nothing. In the second week, she liked two of my stories (one of me and my daughter, and one of a kids' movie she introduced me to, which we used to watch ""together"" as a group of 4 remotely). Meanwhile, it was my birthday. She came to wish me happy birthday and asked strategic questions like: ""How is the new study center going for your daughter?"" and ""How was your mom's exam on day X?"" We talked for two days, but the conversation was much more black and white. Until Friday, she called me. I couldn't answer, but I felt she called with joy. I immediately answered her questions via text, kept talking, and steered the conversation toward her. I got a bit obsessive about the call and what she wanted because I missed her. I asked her to call me before 5 PM. At 5 PM, she tells me she was going to a small town to meet her boyfriend (she never calls him that, only by his name) who was away for those ""two weeks,"" and the three of them were going to the Christmas Village.

I was devastated. I sent a short audio message, to which she ended the conversation saying she had arrived and that we would speak later. I replied, she left a heart reaction, and... nothing until today. It’s been a week and a half. I was desolate the first few days. I haven't made contact. I even bought her a super sweet Christmas gift, I even built it myself... Regarding the trip: she is very attached to her son. She always held the opinion—even as I was getting to know her—that she only needed her boy to be happy. Her latest photos are always just her and the kid; they don't take photos all together, not him, not her. Everything she posts is with her boy. She views my stories, I view hers, zero interaction. I confess I’ve posted some strategic photos, but nothing direct—just me and my daughter—no indirect messages, sad texts, or hints.

**What situation am I in?** I feel like I was used, that she’s not the woman for me, but at the same time, what we lived was inexplicable. Women are truly complex creatures; they can give so much and take it away so quickly. I know I might have been too available and vulnerable, but I also wanted to show certain qualities. Currently, I’m following the No Contact Rule. I don’t look for her, I don't leave a like, nothing... I only view stories and vice versa. But the issue is that I already lost this ""game"" the last time she pinged me. Additionally, I have that gift to give her, but right now I don't want to show any more vulnerability.

I’ll be honest with you... a week ago, I just wanted her back. Today, my feet are more firmly on the ground, and I see that a lot of it might have just been an illusion. But I need to be okay. There are sleepless nights, moments unlived because my head is always imagining scenarios...

**What do you think will happen next?** Since it’s certain we will cross paths, either because of him or in the summer... Will she ever come back? Nothing in life is certain, I know... but please leave your help/advice. I needed to write this as a diary entry to talk to someone. Please don't criticize.",2,1765140634.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

**Drug/dose:** Levofloxacin 500mg x 10 + long acting steroid.

**Initial symptoms:** Nausea, HR/BP dysregulation, tendon aches

**Symptoms now:** Achilles and calf pains and soreness, joints in general, and body feels beaten up. The nausea is mostly gone after peaking end of week 1.

**Symptoms development:** I recovered much in week 3 but ended up walking far with inflammation and have barely been able to walk since but it is slowly getting better again.

**Rehab:**

Ive been restrained by pain/inflammation/fear. I am not doing anything other that trying to stay under inflammation.

**Diet:**

Ive tried intermittent fasting 18-48 hours. Low histamine diet or keto is best for me, and intermittent fasting on most days. If I start eating sugars my appetite gets messed up and everything gets messy.

**Supplements:**

Iodine, Mag, Bs, Zinc, Copper, Selenium, Q10, ALA, NAC, NAD, Vit C, Omega3, Potassium, Resveratrol, Quercitin, Glycine.

I base the stack around the Iodine, ive tested tolerance and am not megadosing.

And I just microdose the NAD/NAC/Glycine/ALA/Polyphenols for now.

I have been trying what works, it is a lot to get used to and I have been inconsistent lately.

**Mental:**

Ive done well staying calm, meditation, coming to accepts the predicament, not be angry, and researching quickly; but I have failed to quit coffee, smoking weed and tobacco. I am kind of realizing now that it is not an option to continue because If this predicament deteriorates then I will never get to try not smoking now.

For me, its tempting to just try stay put, intermittent fast, clean diet, quit vices, drink water, take them supplements, meditate all day and nofap. Its what I would do if not foolish.

If anybody is in a similar predicament, feel free to reach out, because I do want to talk about the rehab, supplements and coping in general.",2,1765140530.0,floxies,0,1.0,False

They aren’t human anymore. Don’t forget that. Don’t listen to it, don’t look at it, don’t think, don't even think. If you see it or get near it or sense its agents are nearby, or you start suddenly thinking about sunflowers, or feel anything out of the ordinary, close off your mind and think happy thoughts until you’re out of range. At this point I don’t know how far they have spread, but I want this warning out there while I can still give it. 

**03/03/25 – 0900 hours** 

Entry 1 

I worked at a government testing facility. I ran away, leaving my coworkers to clean up the mess. This is less of an exposé piece and more of a confessional, so the details of its location and such are irrelevant. I just pray this might abstain me of some of my sins. I’m not a religious man but I now know there are things beyond this world, or at the very least, our understanding of it, so I might as well try and cover ass. 

I also think it wants me to tell you all about it... I’m not sure. A throbbing pain permeates inside my skull, clouding my thoughts. It’s a constant pressure from within, sitting behind my eyes, travelling all the way through to the back of my head, caressing me as it fades down my spine. It’s consistency and my nebulous mind has created a constant brain fog, so forgive me if my writing is nonsensical at any point. 

I’ve seen my fair share of horrible things. To be honest, we’re not entirely ethically sound there. But it helps us all sleep at night if we think we’re doing something for the greater good at the end of the day, finding comfort in some self-imposed moral ambiguity. Yet no amount of mental gymnastics can excuse what we’ve done. 

August 17^(th), a team debrief was held to establish understanding of our next project. Bright and early in the morning my four other colleagues and I filed into the observation room, its interior white like sugar - glistening, pristine surfaces covering every square inch. We gather in the corner, beside the hissing coffee machine, in a queue waiting for our turn. A window into the world we would watch daily filled the wall opposite us. Our debriefer followed us in and stood in front of it. The window and him separated by our workstations, long tables connected and covered in computers and stationery. At first glance it hardly resembled a research lab, more akin to an interrogation room. 

Our debriefer read from a clipboard, barely able to see past the mounds of eye bags that rest between his tired gaze and his reading material, droned on about a new, experimental, “revolutionary”, form of communication, lips loose as each word fell out of his mouth. Not a single person in the room was convinced; we all just took notes and followed along begrudgingly like anyone on a Monday morning would. The debriefer looked like Monday morning incarnate. Craig, the man on my right, letting out sigh as he wrote, the woman on my left was visibly rolling her eyes. I’d worked with this team before, some members more than others, and we were no strangers to failed experiments. In fact, I used to work with Craig a lot, and at one point, I even considered him a friend. In recent years, Craig has endured a melancholic depression due to the passing of his wife years ago. Suicide. 

Suddenly, what felt like an encore of my morning alarm shook me to attention, waking me more than its predecessor. However, this alarm took the form of a mess of a professor bursting through the door, almost crashing into our desks, then steadying himself as he stood next to our debriefer. A flurry of emotions spewed from this man's demeanor, from frustration to excitement to exhaustion to... paranoia? He was a mess. Untucked shirt, titled glasses, messy hair. He had the eyes of a man lacking sleep, as well as the desire to do so. Yet his chin held so high all he could do is look down on us. As if he could grace the gods themselves. He did not have an ego or high self-esteem. His sin was the pride he had for his work. 

“This is no ordinary communication technique!” He announced, emphasizing his words with dramatic hand movements. “Listen well please. I have designed a quick procedure that alters minds. You can think of it as a form of mental walkie-talkie, if you wish to keep your view skewed, just know that it is so much more than that. They have unlocked, um-” a brief pause, lost in thought. “No, actually, I won't get into the details.” He stammered. He went on, and during his tirade our previous debriefer and this raving loon had come to a non-verbal agreement that the old debriefers' work here was done, as he handed over his clipboard and shambled out of the room.    
“All I need from you all is to follow the tests I put in your mission outlines and take extremely detailed notes.” The professor said. He walked to the door, this time much calmer and purposeful. “Telepathy people. This is telepathy.” He said over his shoulder on his way out. I now notice that the room's tone had shifted to curious and awake. He couldn’t be serious, right? Maybe he put receivers in these poor people's brains that read their thoughts and sent them to the others. Yet somehow the way he’s talking about it makes it seem worse and more complicated than that. Telepathy? This building is for science, not magic.  

All we could do as a team was share a few confused glances before our mission began. Five people, each wearing button up shirts with their allocated number, entered the room beyond the glass wall. Their new home was big enough to comfortably fit them all, full of beds, two private bathrooms in the back-end corners of the room, male and female, a dining table and chairs, and a shelf of reading material present opposite the door they came in. We were to watch these people through our one-sided window for an undisclosed amount of time. And they had “telepathy”. “Ridiculous” was the conclusion I came to. 

 

 

As I’m recounting my experiences here, I’ve realized that my head is spinning, and the sweat is starting to pool at the base of my keyboard. I wish none of this was true, I wish to return home, I wish to not know what I know. It terrifies me. Anxiety is swelling up in my throat and it's all beginning to bubble over. The room is shifting and rotating like I’m a lost sock in a broken washing machine filled with shit. My heart sinks below the floorboards of the filthy shack that I've found myself in. Even below the surface I can feel it pounding and urging me to stay alert. Eyes are on me. I’m surrounded by whispering voices that want in, but I won’t let them get to me. Bangs on the door rattle through my ear drum, piercing my skull with each thump, and I feel as though I’m going to collapse. I heave and I heave but nothing leaves me. No barf. No breath. Only desperate wheezes.  

Until it stops.  

Silence. 

Maybe this was a mistake. 

 

**03/04/25 – 1300 hours** 

Entry 2 

Whatever “procedure” the professor spoke of earlier had already taken place. All that was left was to test and observe. 

The first few days were boring and normal. They all engaged in small talk and got to know each other. A young Korean girl, maybe in her early twenties (She was labelled number 1 on her uniform), confided with a single mother from Bangladesh, she had the most caring eyes and had a strong maternal instinct (number 2). A shorter Caucasian man, (3) was telling an equally short, older uncle from Singapore (4) about his gambling troubles (the reason he’s here). The Singaporean listened intently and tried to give advice with his hands comfortably sitting behind his back. The gambler did not listen in return, only vented. A tall African American man (5) immediately inspected the collection of reading material on the shelves. He seemed quiet and was by far the most physically fit in the group. 

Their life details and anything that may be important are in our files. We were encouraged to still use their numbers, not their names. According to our records these were test subjects, not people, it’s almost barbaric. A lot of people here only saw them as such, subjects that aided in the advancement of, well, whatever the government wished to advance, I suppose. Craig was always against this. Made him furious that they “weren't even granted the basic human decency to have a name.” Even now, I can't remember their names. 

 

Test 1- 

It was simple. We ask them to briefly tell us how they’re feeling, what they’re thinking about, then to think of something specific.  

Korean girl (1) was first- 

“okay”, “home”. 

“Think of sunflowers.” Craig spoke to them through a speaker. 

Bangladesh woman (2)- 

“tired”, “my children”, again, told to think of sunflowers.  

By this point we’d forgotten the professor's speech, and the drawl of work took us over again, sifting through tests and notes as our tasks wore on. 

The gambler (3)- 

“bored”, “money,” sunflowers. 

Singaporean uncle (4)- 

“Huh? Oh! Happy"", “my new friends.” Sunflowers. 

The fit dark-skinned man (5)- 

“intrigued”, “your book collection.” Sunflowers. 

We then went on to record their brain activity, blood pressure, etc. All baseline stuff. We repeated these tests every three hours for the first day with no noteworthy results. At 2200 hours our coworker, Dylan, a gruff man and a heavy cynic, grabbed the microphone to speak to our guests.  

“Do any of you feel anything worth noting?” He grumbled past his thick beard.  

“... I’m tired of thinking about sunflowers. hahaha” the Singaporean uncle chimed.  

“Do the rest of you feel this way?” Dylan asked the room. His question was answered with shrugs and silence. After a sigh he asked “Hear any... voices? In your head that... aren’t your own?”   
He was jumping a bit forward. These tests were specifically structured. We weren’t sure how much the patients knew of what the results of the procedure were, but I knew he was not supposed to ask that. I suppose it didn’t matter as his question was once again greeted by a confused silence. “Typical.” Dylan huffed, off mic, to only himself, I suppose. He walked away and promptly clocked off for the night. Dylan would be in deep shit once this got out, the higher ups are very particular. He was prone to frustrated out bursts at tests he thought were a waste of time.    
“What do you mean “voices”?” The tall number 5 asked. We had no answer to give to our neighbors on the other side of the window, so we gave no answer. Anything outside of taking notes and tests was above our pay grade anyway, so we all began packing up and clocking out too. 

Gabriella, Craig, and I were the last to leave. Gabriella was shy and thorough with her notes, so she stayed a while to revise and observe at her station. She was deep in her files like a cave diver dislocating themselves just to enter a virgin passage, a hair tie holding back her deep brunette hair from hindering her work. She only halted every now and then to push up her thick framed glasses. I was tired and made myself another coffee on my way out, Craig joined me, though we didn’t speak, so I passed silent glances between Gabriella, the test subjects, and my feet, as if they were playing some invisible three-way tennis match. We, the lucky few, witnessed their first signs. “Stupid sunflowers.” The Korean girl, the gambler, and the Singaporean uncle moaned in unison. They looked at each other confused, as did we. They began a debate on coincidence or not. An hour of overtime note taking and observing, and the rest of us window watchers were able to head home. 

 

This was the first time they did that, spoke in unison I mean, lord knows it's not the last.  

I can still hear their synchronized groans. 

I need a drink before I think about this anymore.  

 

 

**03/06/25 – 0240 hours** 

Entry 3 

I forgot to write today (yesterday?). Forgetting feels nice. Easily achievable with the appropriate amount of pain killers and alcohol. I’ve made sure to stock my temporary motel room with said supplies and spent the day partaking in them. It doesn’t help the dizziness, but I finally feel mental quiet and physical numbness. 

I don’t know why I’m even hiding. Why I’m jumping from motel to motel. It could find me if it wants. I’m sure if anyone else from my old job was looking for me, they’d find me too.  

It just feels right. To run. It's all I can do. 

I’m sorry, Craig, if you're out there. I didn’t mean for this to happen. Any of it. 

That last look you gave me will haunt me the most. 

 

**03/06/25 – 1840 hours** 

Entry 4 

Day two of the experiment wasn’t noteworthy, except for the fact that Dylan didn’t come in. In fact, he never came in again. Who knows if he got fired or if another terrible fate befell him. We went on as usual, though. Test, watch as their food is delivered and eaten, test, watch, test. More baselines, asking them how they’re feeling, etc., etc 

In-between tests I tried to make small talk mixed with half assed attempts at humor with Craig and the rest of the crew. “Lovely day for it, huh?” knowing we’d be inside our windowless box all day, the weather not affecting us in the slightest. I don’t think they heard me, because they didn’t laugh. Gabriella buried herself in her work, the woman I didn't know the name of would give one-word answers out of politeness but clearly did not want to be spoken to (I did learn her name was Alexa though). And Craig, well, the usual, barely receiving eye contact let alone a conversation. His eyes were sunken and soulless, and he’d lost the extra weight he had around him and then some. He’s still torn up inside over what happened. Does he know it eats away at me too? I don’t know what led us to continue to work here, but here we are, the invisible hand of fate guiding us along. 

I stewed in my own anguish for most of that day. Silent crew, lack luster results, Craig, all of it was dragging me down. At the time I remember wanting nothing more than a drink, but my 2-month company mandated sobriety streak loomed over me, so a coffee would have to suffice.  

The professor snapped me out of my mental crisis with yet another unannounced intrusion.    
“After receiving your reports yesterday, I updated your work outline. I’m aware that there are cameras that are monitored, and the recordings are checked, however, I have brought up the possibility of 24-hour personnel monitoring with the higher ups, and they seem to agree.” This alone would’ve brought my blood pressure up another notch, resulting in a very good reason to break my sobriety. If it weren’t for his next sentence, that worsened things still. “So, if anything... happens, we have eyewitnesses. They called me mad, but I already know this will be a great success.” This man and his cryptic nonsense were going to send me over the edge today. 

“Are you going to explain a single thing to us? How can we do our job without the facts? Now we’re supposed to monitor them 24/7?” I hissed through clenched teeth, stress weighing on me. 

“We don’t know the details of what happened to these people or what will happen. Do they even know?” Craig announced, stepping forward. Craig was a selfless, soft man. He wasn’t even surprised about the extra hours, he just wants to help these people. Looking at him, I noticed that he’d turned pale. 

“We’re getting paid overtime for this right?” Alexa added. 

“Yes, yes. Please trust me, we will get to all that soon. In the meantime, ... Do your fucking jobs.” The Professors smiley answer turned to a spit and a snarl. On his way out, he mentioned one last thing. “You will be paid double for this of course.” 

We apparently need the money just as much as the people beyond the glass because at the end of the day we’re all still here. Exiting our observation room, at the end of the hall, past the locked door of the test subjects, is our new home, fitted with beds, a kitchen, a bathroom and of course a full camera monitoring set up so we can continue our work, day in, day out. We were only allowed in this room outside of regular working hours. Anyone not agreeing to these terms and who wants to go home was instructed to do so but not to return.

Entry 5 

There was a knock at my door last night, at least I think there was. Of course I didn’t answer, I didn’t even have the courage to get out of bed. It came during my extensive nightly attempt to sleep after my last entry. Just three quick taps of my motel door, a fair few feet away from me and instantly my breath was caught in my chest, I was unable to move a muscle. Like stone, like I wasn’t even alive, I lay there unmoving, waiting. Waiting for what, I don’t know, but the lord knows I waited. Waiting while the room is filled with nothing but the ticking clock above my head, heart lurching with every tick. And dread. The room was filled with dread, up to the brim. My ears catching every sound, I swear I could hear my own blood pump and yet I couldn’t tell if my heart was as still as I was or if it was fluttering and fleeing the confines of my ribcage. It must have been hours before I almost had the courage to shuffle an inch again. Alas, before my freedom was granted, another knock came. Another quick three taps. How could this be? The exact same knock, hours apart. I was surely hearing things again, I must be. But this felt so real, and my delusions come in quick intense spats, not this prolonging torture.  

Was it there? On the other side of the door. Waiting as I too am waiting. Still, as I too am still! Barely breathing as I too am barely breathing! I must be going mad. I can’t take this anymore, I thought. Now I knew for certain that my heart was racing, pumping, pounding! I was about to get up. Dear god I was actually about to go face this thing. Launch from my bed and lunge at the door, a desperate attack, an attempt better than nothing. Better than laying here for eternity. A clashing of symbols, an impact of a waterfall, a climax of an explosion, a RUSH. Fighting the bed sheets that engulfed me, I escaped my own mental restraints and sprinted for the door. Before even a blink could arrive, I did. Right at the door. Fate on the other side.  

 

 

Of course it was empty. Of course nothing was there. I stood with the door swung open and nothing but cool air brushing against me like a mother caressing and calming a child. As I began to close the door, as it slid past my face and almost shut, I saw it.  

 

A letter sat at my feet.  

 

**03/08/25 - 1652 hours** 

Entry 6 

By now it was August 28th, and we had adjusted to our living standards quickly. Alexa and Gabriella got along well, sharing notes, theories, and even started talking about their personal lives. Gabriella wanted to start her own lab and studies. Me and Craig even began to talk. Small talk and work talk but still talk. 

I pushed open the door to our main observation room that morning, balancing a paper cup filled with coffee on my clipboard, free hand used to button up my shirt. Craig was already there, leaning against the counter, staring through the glass. 

“Morning,”. I said as I joined him. 

Craig snorted. “Barely. You look like you lost a fight with your alarm clock.” 

“I did,” I replied. “It won by a landslide.” 

“Good to see you’re still getting your sleep.”  

I scoffed. “I wouldn’t say that” 

“Struggling huh?” He took a sip from his own coffee. “Yeah, me too. If they’re going to force us to sleep here, they could at least give us some half decent mattresses.” 

We shared a chuckle, even though we both knew the mattresses weren’t the issue. Then we went to work. We had a routine and things were nice. The subjects reported nothing more than difficulty sleeping, increased appetite and a small amount of anxiety, all of which could be attributed to their environment, so we brought in some requested items for each of them. The Bangladesh woman requested a photo of her family, the Singaporean uncle requested a potted plant, the gambler wanted his marriage ring (he was divorced), the African American man wanted a book from home, and the Korean girl shyly requested her bear plushy, said it helped her sleep. 

It was going smoothly. Those were the best days of the experiment. The last good day of our lives.  

“What’d you say?” The gambler said as he got up from his bed. Confused glances spread throughout their room as we, the watchers, leaned forward at our workstations.  “Don’t act dumb! What did you say? I “stink”?!” He said something along those lines. This time he received a series of “Huh's” and “what’s”, confusion and tension growing. His gaze was locked onto the Korean girl sitting on the floor with her bear plushy. Her innocence radiated from her, yet the gambler was in denial. He approached her and swiftly yanked her bear away from her.  

“I didn’t say shit, you freak!” She screamed in retaliation. “You do stink though.” she grumbled under her breath. This girl was usually quiet, for such a sudden outburst the plushy must’ve meant a lot to her. She couldn’t have been younger than 19 yet she clung to it like a child. By this escalation, the rest of the room began defending the girl.    
“What? No, I’m not crazy... I-” he said with shaky breaths as he held his head with one hand and the bear with the other. “No. No! I know what this is. This isn’t how it was meant to be. He said it was like a walkie-talkie! We can just turn it off. Are you able to hear what I think without my consent!? Why can I hear you all! Judging me!” He shouted, fear in his voice, holding the bear high.  

 

Test 2- 

Craig once again had control of the microphone as he instructed the room to calm down and return the girl's belongings to her. They were told to sit on their respective beds and listen. 

“Number one, I need you to focus. Please tell us what you're thinking,” Craig asked. 

“I want to go home. Are you sure I’ll be safe in here?” The girl said. Her rage had subsided and was replaced with a growing fear.  

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking"" Craig visibly gulped down his empathy as he forced himself to ignore the girl's question and follow the script in our work outline. 

“No, I have no idea what they’re thinking.” She responded. 

“Number two, what are you thinking about?” Craig continued. 

“I think Number three should be removed from this experiment after that outburst.” The Bangladesh woman confessed. 

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking,"" Craig repeated. After some deep thought, she had an answer for this seemingly silly question. 

“I think... someone is thinking of sunflowers again.”  

“Number three-” Craig began. 

“This is bullshit” The gambler cut off the voice echoing out of the speaker. “And I think someone wants their bear back” he continued. Odd, since the girl already had her bear plushy returned to her. 

“Number four.” 

“Well, uh, I must admit I was thinking of sunflowers.” The old Singaporean sat, staring at the Bangladesh woman who stared back. “I think she’s thinking of her children.” 

“Number five.” 

“I... want my bear back...” The large man sat so smally as he said this, staring at his hands and hunched over.  

“That is all for now.” one last note from Craig before he turned off the microphone and leaned back in his chair, brushing his hair back with a long exhale. The people inside the room split off into their usual groups and quietly discussed the results of this test. Number five sat on his own and read. We took our notes. 

 

**03/09/25 - I don't know what time it is** 

Entry 7 

My mirror was altered this morning. Everything morphed back to that place it took me. It felt like a stone had dropped inside my stomach once I realized what I was looking at. I was frozen, my eyes glued to the gaping maw of that beast's labyrinth that it had put me in. It was grinning. The walls melting around me, pooling at my feet, momentary madness coalescing as I witness spiraling swirls of chaos slowly forming from memories. Reflection shifted from me to Gabriella’s and Craig’s disgusted glare before I ran away and never came back. I abandoned them then and there. Then shifting once more to that thing. Then finally, to that place. 

The memory emerged through thick clouds of steam that clung to the mirror before they evaporated. I saw a longing held back behind tight lips for years. The face of someone I’d known for many more. The face of someone I loved for far too late. All along, these feelings were shared between us. What had we done? A passionate moment shared between friends. Friends.   
“Arthur... Arthur!”   
A moment and a mistake made a life. A life, not belonging to him, but to me. A life that ended too soon, before it even left the womb. That part was no one's fault. Guilt, shame, sadness, loss, resulting in the loss of another. 

I loved her first. It's not my fault. 

It showed me it all again. It showed everyone. Things I tried to desperately forget. There is no forgetting now. 

I could feel beads of sweating form and slide from every pore. I may have stood in that puddle of sweat for an hour, reliving what I’d done all over again. Worlds of pleasure and anguish had become too much, and I collapsed into a pathetic ball on my bathroom floor. I couldn’t resist crying.

I’ve been taking things slow and getting to know this guy before I ask him out. I’ve known him for ~ a year in a professional environment but since that ended we’ve remained in touch. Right now we’re friends who hang occasionally. Usually we talk for a while at each other’s apartments, exchange books, and we’ve also gotten coffee and gone to a flea market together. We haven’t really met each other’s friends yet. 

I’m hosting a holiday party with my group of friends this weekend (about 15 people) and had the thought to invite him. I’m on the fence. Some of my friends know how I feel about him. And does it send the wrong “signal”? Or since we’re friends already does it really matter?

I’ve never had to properly date before after meeting my ex online, so I’m not exactly knowledgeable or confident.

I met this girl on bumble and she’s really sweet. We went on a first date to get coffee and food which I think went really well, she was laughing a lot and gave me lots of compliments, and we were there for maybe 3 hours.

She said she wanted to see me again after asking me for my opinion. I said I’d happily see her again but was probably going to take things slow. (We’re both looking for something long term)

I walked her back to her car, and then gave her a hug. She said it was a terrible hug (it was 😂), so asked for another. She said that one was better and then asked to hug like 3 more times. When I got home she messaged that she had a really nice time, and when we actually hugged properly it felt nice. We called for almost an hour the day after and text a lot.

She already asked for us to meet again, just 2 days after the first date (today), but cancelled in the morning saying she wasn’t feel well but we could reschedule.

I’ve spoke to her over text and she still seems interested, and said “I hope you enjoy speaking to me as much as I enjoy speaking to you x”. And now she’s invited me over to her house on Wednesday. If it does end up happening, I’ve never been in this situation before, being in another girls house that I’m not in a relationship with…

Im not actually sure what we’ll do there but maybe watch something or go on a dog walk. I guess my question is should I put my arm around her or even ask her if I can kiss her? Will she be expecting me to make a move?

1pgt2y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1pgt2y0/free_link_please/,Free link please,"*My father died in the same bed as my childhood friend's mother. When they were found, their lower bodies were still locked together.
From that moment on, Mitchell and I became mortal enemies.
He drove a car straight into my father’s funeral.
I smashed his mother’s urn on the dock and scattered her ashes into the sea.
Our hatred consumed us, sharp and venomous. We spent ten years wounding each other until we finally wore ourselves out.
He took his crew and left for Mexico.
I stayed in New York and became the city's most sought-after bounty hunter.
But when we met again years later, he was neither my enemy nor the boy I once knew.
He walked into the morgue—into the room where I was lying.
Years later, we finally got the chance to faced each other in silence.

After finishing my job, I hurried back to the small bakery I used as a front to tend to my injuries.
The wall-mounted TV showed Mitchell Harvey's return.
The former golden boy of New York's elite circles, now Mexico's top arms dealer, was back in town. Of course, it was headline news.
I roughly bandaged my wound and moved toward the small memorial corner I kept for my father.
Suddenly, a girl with chin-length hair burst into the shop.
She looked serious but spoke loudly. Clutching red roses, she pointed at the display case. ""I'll take everything here!""
Close behind was Roderick Dunlap, Mitchell's best friend and right-hand man.
When he saw me, he froze, his expression tightening. ""Yas, maybe we should go somewhere else?""
The girl refused immediately. ""No way!
""I brought Mitch desserts from here before. He said they were amazing. It's his birthday today. I need to get more.""
She gave me a pleading look. ""Ma'am, my fiancé's returning today. He loves your pastries. Could I use your space for a birthday surprise?""
I couldn't refuse, so I nodded.
""Could we get some extra desserts?"" she asked.
I agreed, noticing my fresh bandage was already bleeding through.
I hid my hand under my apron and walked unsteadily toward the kitchen.
It wasn't fear or nostalgia.
My illness was flaring up again.
It was incurable.
""Roderick, we're running out of time! Help me set up! Mitch's gonna be here any minute, and I want everything perfect.""
Roderick didn't move.
He knew Mitchell was never happy to see me.
On the news broadcast, Mitchell smiled for the cameras, yet his eyes remained cold.
""I'm sure she's watching too. I'm looking forward to... seeing her again.""
 
###Chapter 2
The camera zoomed in, highlighting the scar bisecting his eyebrow.
It was my doing, with a knife.
I was having a bad day, and he was there. So, I attacked him.
The ugly scar on my neck was his doing. He crushed a glass and used a shard to attack me.
Again, there was no deep motive.
We had a simple understanding: hurt the other, get hurt in return. We liked seeing each other in pain.
The news anchor smiled suggestively. ""Planning a long stay, Mr. Harvey? Those roses... Are you meeting someone special?""
He paused, his voice low. ""My fiancée.""
In the shop, the girl was adjusting roses in a candelabra. She glanced up at the TV.
""Roderick,"" she said, ""I heard Mitch had some messy history with a girl here for ten years. You know anything about that?""
I kept my head down, polishing a knife, but felt Roderick's gaze flicker toward me.
""Mitch!"" Her shout cut through the tension.
She forgot her umbrella and dashed outside.
""Yas.""
Mitchell caught her in a one-armed hug, his umbrella shielding her from the rain.
She rose on her toes and pressed a quick, rain-damp kiss to his lips.
I thought I saw him lean back, just slightly.
Then his eyes found mine through the wet glass.
The girl tried to turn, but he cupped her chin and kissed her again, deeper this time.
I looked away and snipped the ribbon I was holding.
Roderick approached.
""Paulette,"" he said, voice low. ""It's his birthday. For one night, could you just not anger him?""
He hesitated, seeming to think of something. ""She's nineteen. Clean slate. Reminds him of you before.""
I nodded, my fingers feeling numb.
""She's pretty. Prettier than I was.""
The door opened. Mitchell stood there, folding his black umbrella.
""Discussing my fiancée?""
His tone was light, but his stare was cold as it rested on me.
 
###Chapter 3
Roderick watched me, holding his breath.
He was waiting for one of my classic outbursts.
Instead, I simply pushed the boxed cake toward them. ""Your dark chocolate cheesecake.""
Yasmine Murphy gazed at Mitchell with adoration. ""Try it, Mitch. Is this your favorite?""
He took a sip of coffee, rubbing the edge of the cup, before cutting a small piece with the silver dessert fork.
""Bitter. Unpleasantly so. Not for me.""
His tone was light, his eyes smiling as he teased Yasmine.
She looked confused and took a bite herself. ""It's delicious! You're lying to me again!""
She didn't see that his gaze remained fixed on me over her head.
Suddenly, the door chime jangled loudly.
""Hey, Mitch! Welcome back!""
A few men crowded in, their laughter cutting off abruptly when they saw me.
Their eyes followed me, wary and questioning, before turning to Roderick.
I carried over the pot of lemonade. The men flinched in unison, raising their hands defensively, as if I were holding acid.
Back when Mitchell and I were at each other's throats, his crew got caught in the crossfire a few times.
It was never anything serious, just minor incidents. I was surprised they still reacted this way.
Someone nudged Roderick. ""Roddy, what's she doing here?""
Roderick just shrugged, not explaining.
""Enjoy your lemonade,"" I said, turning to leave.
Yasmine caught my wrist. ""Wait! Could you take a picture for us?""
""No,"" I said, calmly removing her hand.
I'd only taken a few steps when a figure moved to block my path.
I looked up to see Mitchell's gloomy face. ""I know how this works,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Everything has a price. So name it. How much to get you to...""
He paused deliberately, waiting for me to react. When I didn't, he finished coldly. ""Take a picture for us.""
I looked him over and tried to step around him.
A sharp pressure on a nerve in my arm sent a jolt of pain through me, and my legs gave way. I fell to my knees. A black card was flung down, its edge catching my cheek and drawing a thin line of blood.
""That's more than enough to make you disappear.""
I pushed myself back to my feet, my fingers gingerly touching the cut, my eyes fixed on Mitchell.
Yasmine quickly stepped between us, her smile strained. ""Mitch, stop it, okay?
""Sorry, miss. He must have had too much to drink.""
But he didn't smell of alcohol. He was simply picking a fight, same as always.
It convinced me he'd been having such a good time abroad that he'd forgotten who he was dealing with.
I bent down, picked up the black card, and stood facing him again.
His friends let out a low laugh.
""Some things never change. She still jumps for money.""
He held out his phone with a confident smirk, pleased by my apparent cooperation.
I moved fast. I grabbed his jaw, scraped the edge of the card through a thick glob of chocolate frosting, and shoved it into his mouth.
I didn't stop until I smelled blood. Then I grabbed two glasses from the table and poured the liquor down his throat.
""Consider your mouth cleaned,"" I said.
I turned and slapped the man who had spoken. ""Learn when to keep quiet.""
The whole thing was over in seconds. No one else moved. The only sound was the rain hitting the windows.
Roderick, leaning against the far wall, drained his glass and sighed heavily. ""I told you not to provoke her.""
Yasmine finally snapped out of her shock, her posture defensive as she confronted me. ""We were out of line first. I get it. But this is just insane!""
She raised her hand to strike me.
""Ah!"" I caught her wrist mid-swing and slapped her, hard, across the face.
The sound was sharp in the quiet room.
Mitchell spat out a mix of blood and frosting, a cold smile on his lips. ""You want a fight with me? Fine. But you can't touch her.""
He pulled the sobbing Yasmine close, her cheek still swollen from the slap. ""How about I trash this place for you? Will that make you feel better?""
She nodded and covered her cheek, tears in her eyes.
His bodyguards in black swarmed in. Clubs swung down, shattering glass and smashing the overhead light.
Cold wind and rain blew through the broken windows, soaking my face.
Mitchell gripped my chin, forcing my head up.
""You didn't start this. But she needs to see it end. Send me the bill for the damages. All of it.""
His eyes scanned me like I was a piece of discarded furniture.
I shoved his hand away, a sudden coughing fit seizing me. I frantically searched through the wreckage.
A small white prescription bottle rolled into view. My eyes locked onto it.
He was faster. He bent down and plucked it, reading the label.
""Six of these at once? Are you trying to kill yourself?""
He tossed the bottle into a rainwater puddle, put his arm around Yasmine, and walked away.
I knelt by the puddle, retrieved the bottle, and swallowed two more pills.
This medication was for anxiety and pain.
I started with half a pill. Now, eight couldn't stop my pain.
The pills were nearly gone. And so was I.
 
###Chapter 4
Three years passed, and my mother died too.
My work was unstable. I'd taken many lives and become a target myself.
I'd spent all my savings on that bakery. Now, with it destroyed, I had nowhere left to go.
Maybe it was the pain seizing my limbs again, but I lacked the strength to move. I simply sat amidst the wreckage, letting the rain soak me.
Overnight, every major tabloid in New York led with ""Mitchell Harvey Returns to Wreak Havoc on His Ex.""
By sunrise, I was ready to leave.
Before going, I faced the shattered ruins and slowly bowed.
Mitchell appeared out of nowhere. He hauled me to my feet with one hand.
""It's just a bakery. Is it worth this?""
I slapped his hand away, steadied myself, and then struck him three sharp slaps across the face.
""My parents' memorial plaques were inside. They're gone now,"" I said, my voice flat. ""The bow was necessary.""
He worked his jaw, then smirked. ""Three slaps for your mother's memorial? Sounds like I got the better deal.""
I ignored him, staring at the devastation.
He stood behind me, deliberately twisting the knife.
""Paulette Sherman. I'm talking to you.""
I acted as if I hadn't heard and walked away.
He caught up in a few strides, blocking my path.
""Stop pretending you're fine! Look at yourself. You're ghostly pale. What are you trying to prove?""
""My old condition flared up. A little tired, that's all."" I looked up, offering a cold smile. ""Mitchell, did you really think you were important enough to affect me?""
But I knew the truth.
He'd come back specifically to make my life hell.
If I were still in good health, I wouldn't mind another round, maybe breaking a few of his bones in the process.
But now, just standing upright consumed all my energy.
In the hospital, the smell of disinfectant was nauseating.
Several doctors studied my scans, their expressions grim.
""How much of your last prescription is left?""
""It's gone.""
""Gone?!"" Steven Harriman's voice rose sharply. ""That was a three-month supply! It's only been a week!""
Steven had handled my case for years. His hesitation told me everything—my time was running out.
""Is... there anyone else in your family?"" he asked carefully.
""Have you forgotten?"" My tone was flat. ""My father's dead. My mother's gone. It's just me.""
He removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""You were managing well for three years. What happened this past week...""
My phone screen lit up with a news alert—a prominent photo of Mitchell with Yasmine on his arm at some gala.
The person I thought I was over still hurt me the most.
Mitchell was the source of my deepest wounds, the one who knew how to hurt me most without leaving a mark.
""Your condition is extremely unstable. After stopping the medication, the first week, the first month, and the third month are all critical periods.
""Take this,"" he said, handing me a small bottle. His voice was heavy. ""Three pills when the pain is severe. No more than three.""
Before he finished, I'd twisted the cap off, shaken a handful into my palm, and dry-swallowed them.
The number didn't matter, as long as it dulled the bone-deep agony.
A week or three months made no difference to me.
After taking the pills, I crouched in the most inconspicuous corner of the hospital corridor, my back pressed against the cold wall.
I'd figured out that lowering my body temperature could ease the pain.
Cold sweat soaked through my thin clothes.
For ten minutes, I listened to the desperate prayers and weeping outside the operating room, where all hope hung on a single, fragile thread.
""Mommy, isn't that the lady who was in the bed next to us? Should we say goodbye?""
""Her illness... There's no cure. Let's not bother her. Such a tragic case. No family left, and such a severe sickness. She probably won't even have anyone to hold a funeral for her.""
The little girl looked up, confused. ""But surely someone in the world cares about her, right?""
I blinked hard, clearing my blurred vision, and focused on my phone screen.
A text came from Mitchell.
He'd been messaging since last night, persistently asking what compensation I wanted.
I thought about it. Maybe no one cared, but there was one person who could handle the funeral arrangements.
I dialed the number I knew by heart.
He answered instantly.
""Made up your mind?""
I took a sharp breath, swallowing the metallic taste in my mouth. ""If you insist on paying me back, Mitchell, you can be the one to bury me.""
 
###Chapter 5
Silence stretched for seconds on the other end, followed by Mitchell's mocking laugh.
""Paulette, someone as vicious and stubborn as you usually lives forever. But if you do somehow die before me, rest assured, I'll give you the most lavish funeral New York has ever seen. I'll have the whole city light memorial candles for you!""
Satisfied with his promise, I hung up.
Outside the hospital, I saw the mother and daughter again.
The little girl was pounding her chest, her voice full of childish conviction. ""Who says nobody cares about her just because she has no family? Well, I do!""
""Enough, let's go. The bus is. Oh, the bus!"" Her mother pulled her away, rushing for the departing bus.
I walked to the parking garage and got into my black sedan.
Seeing they'd missed the bus, I impulsively rolled down the window. ""Get in. I'll give you a ride.""
I dropped them off downtown. They thanked me profusely and got out.
Just as I was about to pull away, I heard an irritating voice.
""Well, look at that. Paulette did a good deed. I suppose even you need to score some points.""
Mitchell's usual crowd was exiting a nearby club. Yasmine clung to his arm, her gaze sharp and venomous.
I didn't want a scene. I started raising the window to leave.
But Yasmine hurried over and pressed her hand against the glass.
A fake smile played on her lips, but her eyes were cold. ""I just found out about your history with Mitch. I hope we didn't... upset you yesterday?""
I had no patience for her act and tried to close the window again.
She gripped the window frame tightly. ""I have something for you. I really mean no harm.""
""I'm not interested. Get lost."" My patience was gone.
Yasmine suddenly let go. As I started the car, she pulled a small urn from her bag.
""I heard your mother's memorial plaque was destroyed in the shop. I gathered some ashes from the ruins this morning so you'd have something to remember her by.""
Her voice was sweet, but her actions were pure malice.
She reached through the window and poured the contents of the urn onto my passenger seat.
""Oh! You... you didn't catch it!"" she cried, stepping back with a perfect mask of innocence and sly satisfaction. ""You're not mad at me, are you?""
I watched her performance, and a sudden anger burned through the sickness inside me.
Good. She asked for this.
The group by the club entrance, clueless, was still praising Yasmine. ""Yas is so thoughtful, talking to that mess and even giving her a gift.""
Yasmine confidently turned and walked towards a shiny new Porsche parked ahead, triumphantly shaking her key fob.
I rolled down my window and called out, ""Yasmine! I have a gift for you, too!""
Yasmine turned, crossing her arms smugly. ""What are you giving me, Paulette?""
I tightened my seatbelt, my eyes locking on her. ""A one-way trip.""
Before the words faded, I slammed the accelerator.
""Bang!""
The front of my car smashed into the Porsche's rear.
Yasmine's car lurched forward uncontrollably.
I reversed, then slammed the gas again, hitting it a second time!
In the rearview mirror, I saw the drunken group jolt into sobriety.
""She's insane! She's actually insane!""
""I told you she was a lunatic! But you had to provoke her!""
""Relax, she won't really do anything. She's just blowing off steam, and then...""
He didn't finish.
True, I was blowing off steam.
But I wasn't done yet.
Yasmine stumbled out of the smoking car, her face pale, already slipping back into her fragile victim role.
""Mitch, wh... what did I do wrong?""
Mitchell had a cut on his forehead from flying glass, bleeding slightly. He moved urgently to shield Yasmine.
He understood my intent in a single glance.
""Paulette! Don't you dare!""
Ridiculous. There was nothing I dared not do.
I kept my eyes on Yasmine, my expression icy, and floored the accelerator.
The engine roared as the car shot straight toward her.
 
###Chapter 6
I unbuckled my seatbelt, got out, and coldly observed Yasmine sprawled on the pavement a few yards away.
Her legs and arms were scraped and bleeding.
""You're lucky I let off the gas. Otherwise, you'd have more than scratches,"" I stated calmly.
She looked up, her eyes filled with naked hatred. ""Mitchell will make you pay for this!""
I picked up my handbag from the passenger seat, now soiled with the ashes, and used its corner to lift her chin. ""There. The real you is much more tolerable.""
I took the bag back, dusting it off with disgust. The group rushed over.
Mitchell hurried to help Yasmine up.
I took out my phone, called an ambulance, then tossed the handbag toward Yasmine.
""This bag's resale value is about 20,000 dollars. More than enough for her medical bills and the car repairs.""
""Paulette!"" Mitchell's voice was thick with suppressed rage.
I ignored him and walked away.
The taste of blood filled my mouth. I pressed my lips together and quickened my pace.
I nearly ran from the scene. Rounding a corner, sure I was out of sight, I braced myself against a wall and coughed, splattering dark blood onto the grimy brick.
A ringing filled my ears, my vision blurring. I forced myself onward, moving on instinct until I reached my temporary apartment.
If my body had held up, I might have turned back to cause Mitchell more trouble. I desperately wanted to see him furious and helpless against me.
I collapsed near the living room coffee table and poured a glass of water.
But after one sip, I coughed it all back up—water and blood.
The half-glass of water instantly turned crimson.
I lay on the floor, gasping for air. It felt like an invisible hand was twisting my insides. The pain was maddening, but I lacked even the strength to clench my teeth.
I had no idea how much time had passed before the buzzing of my phone and violent pounding on my door dragged me back to consciousness.
For a moment, I'd thought I wouldn't make it through the night.
The name flashing on the screen was Mitchell.
""Paulette! Open the door! I know you're in there!""
His voice came through, threatening and absolute, while the door thumped under his force.
""If you don't open it, I'll break it down!""
I knew he meant it. But I would never let him see me like this—broken and dying.
Summoning the last of my strength, I crawled into the bedroom, moved the wardrobe, and squeezed into the narrow hiding space behind it. The sound of the door being forced open echoed from outside, followed by hurried footsteps.
His texts flooded my screen, one after another.
""Hiding? You think that works?"" ""Get out of here! We need to talk!"" ""If anything happens to Yasmine, I'll make you pay with your life!"" I stared at my phone. A sudden drop of nosebleed hit the screen, forming a dark red stain. My consciousness faded.*",1,1765140299.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

I didn’t become a sigma overnight.

First sign something was wrong:
I woke up at 12:47 PM, looked at my phone… 0 notifications.
Not even my mom. That’s when the villain arc started.

I went to the kitchen. No milk.
Drank water straight from the bottle.
Sigma behavior activated.

At school/work I said “okay” instead of arguing.
Not because I was mature —
because I didn’t care enough to explain.

Someone said:
“Bro, why are you so quiet?”
I replied:
“Lag.”

People thought I was mysterious.
Nah, I was just tired.

I stopped chasing people and started chasing…
sales. discounts. buy 1 get 1 free.

While others were flexing watches,
I was calculating if I could survive the week
on noodles and vibes.

One day I realized:
Talking less saves energy.
Arguing less saves time.
Sleeping more saves sanity.

Now I walk alone not because I’m deep —
but because I forgot to answer messages for 3 days.

Not a beta.

1pgszi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1pgszi1/im_outgoing_i_like_people_i_have_good_life_yet_i/,"I'm outgoing, I like people, I have good life. Yet I feel very alone.","I'm M26. I graduated from uni, I work in glass tower and secured myself a small condo I can renovate by myself. I feel proud and grateful just writing this. My parents are amazing and while we are not coming from wealth, they built themselves great careers over my lifetime and support me uncoditionally. My brother is very cool and I love him. Literally nothing to complain. However, I moved out, because my parents tend to take the steering wheel and influence most of life choices I make. They are not toxic, more like overprotective. To avoid this, I live in other town and visit them rather often to not create copedenency.

So everything is great on paper.

However, after moving out my personality is self-sabotaging itself - I'm outgoing and community-spirited, yet I'm shy/have huge social anxiety (irrational **feeling**, not rational thought, that everyone hates me). And after uni I find myself very lonely. Growing up in multigenerational home and then sharing flats with people to reduce costs, the empty condo hits a lot now.

People in my life spread out and live their lifes. We meet, but don't hang out - it's like a catch-up and then goodbye for next two months. There are no steady relationships. I ordered myself PS5 for the first time to catch up on last 10 years of gaming history, got gifted used coffee machine from my parents... and I have basically no one to invite and share it with. My relationships are like comets, not stars. They come, turn pretty into fireballs and then disappear in same month. I'm not being invited anywhere, no signs of anything if I don't initiate. I get tired/burnt out by checking out on newly met cool people and slowly leave. I tried to joined a few clubs but everytime I feel like I can't stick around. People I meet there and have chats have no desire to go outside the space. This checked out for few spaces I attended regularly.

I have one person I considered my close friend - we lived together in one flat. But she got a boyfriend and basically left the relationship, recuding it to ""beer catch-ups"". That's okay, but it hurts.

So maybe I'm the problem? I ask myself, but when I get drunk and talk about it with the closest people they either refuse or we sort things out and it's okay again. I get wished ""please never change bro"" a lot and I'm met with lots of sympathy. Idk maybe they assume I have good social life when in reality I just come back home and overshare on social media to compensate.

**What I want?** I sometimes ask myself. Maybe I have unrealistic standards? **In all honesty, I just want a steady companionship.** A few people that would hang out from time to time, like that groups of dads going to matches or grandpas playing cards in Italian streets. To make plans together, cook and chill without the whole ""arranging meeting"" thing. A girlfriend would also be nice but I don't want a woman to fix all my societal problems. It feels like scarcity in current world where people watch Netflix after work or invest everything into their partners.

1pgsxtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1pgsxtk/the_notsogreat_part_of_backpacking_the_return_home/,The not-so-great part of backpacking - the return home.,"So I just returned home after a magical 9 months out in Latin America and to say I fell in love abroad would be an understatement - just a shame I can't bring back an entire continent to introduce to my Mother!

But after the constant novelty, seeing sights I could only dream of, meeting incredible people, tasting rich foods and immersing in culture after culture... I walked down the aisle of Terminal 1 - Buenos Aires - to catch my flight back over the Atlantic. 

It was almost blissful ignorance. Around three hours arriving to the airport, I was sat in a square in BA which basked beautifully in the sun; No cars. No people. Just me with my coffee and my journal. And in that moment I really tried to take in that this would be the last moment in a long time where I was this free, not only with my time and energy, but free from any cares or worries or anyone else's problems, it was like a final goodbye to the person I grew to love in this kind of environment and place.

But walking through the aisle in Terminal 3 felt like I was just returning home for a visit because nine months created a totally new lifestyle and my brain was entirely remapped; it was loving this new way. It's strange because on the flight I felt zero sadness, no melancholy or sorrow, just an incredibly pure feeling of satisfaction where I was suddenly starting to believe what my eyes had seen and what my heart had felt in what seemed like time lapse - how was I ALREADY going into the opposite direction so soon? 

I felt totally full, to the point where anything more would be pure gluttony. But I wanted more in a different way. More in the sense that this new kind of more would be much better than the sameness I was about to experience and the new problems I was about to be bombarded with at home, it was a more which shielded me from everything the new version of me now repelled and didn't recognise; all the habits, routines, thoughts, negative cues. It's a huge fear to return and feel like you're reverting back to the ""old you"".

  
But it couldn't be further from the truth. 

You're not going back, you're going forward. Your mind will never be the same again, and your heart pines for something it didn't know it could pine for. Everything slows down. You realise that although people back home care about your trip, they will never care as much as you do. Though they can try to understand, you have to remember that their last nine months compared to yours were like two lines going into the opposite direction, they cannot empathise. 

Walking in the opposite direction back towards home in the terminal which felt like i'd just walked through with my one way ticket out of there was a mountain of surrealism, like i'd just been plonked back and nothing had changed. My ears still had salsa music ringing in them and asado churning in my stomach - how was I already home?!

But the way i've tried to overcome the longing for a place that saw me and accepted me for all my parts is this - the country may have changed, but you're still that same person that is forever changed. Sure, you can't do all the things you did in those countries when back home, but you sure can implement the small things that make you feel connected to it. 

Keep learning the language. Listen to the music. Stay connected with those you met there. Tell the stories and create content on them. Recreate the food that made you fall in love with a place. And just know - although all great things come to an end, you did it and no one can take those experiences away from you. ",14,1765139944.0,backpacking,3,1.0,False

1pgswo1,https://i.redd.it/a8m6tlagcu5g1.jpeg,The Memory Place Part One,"Hello, before the story begins I would like to clarify something. This story is a continuation and a further exploration of one of the side stories from my book (**THE MEMORY PLACE**, first ever one I have written actually). The narrative is completely original and the knowledge of the book is not required to understand any of it. That's all. Enjoy.



**The Memory Place: One-Way Magician**



“Hey so anyways I was wondering if you’re doing anything tonight?”

“No, not really, I only have sleep on my agenda. Why do you ask? What’s up?”

“Oh… do you wanna hangout? Watch this movie I picked up, at my place?”

“Oh, uhh… sure I’d like that. Which one did you get?”

“‘Unsettled Admirers’”

“I haven’t heard of that one”

“Me neither, it looked interesting though”

“What’s it about?”

“It’s about two people who have feelings for one and the other. Though they don’t know each other, they have never crossed paths directly, never interacted face to face. The only exposure each has of the other being a distant and a secretive one. The narrative follows both of them trying to leave the other hints of their admiration, but each of their attempts always goes unnoticed. Which leads to one of them coming to terms with his love not being mutual and with the other turning to sinister actions due to the other's dismissal of her love""

“That does sound interesting, can’t wait to see it”

“Super, okay how does eight o’clock sound to you?”

“Perfect”

“Okay then, see you at eight Carrie”

“See you”



I wonder if he’s going to make a move tonight. I want him to. I don’t have enough courage to do so myself. The length which my courage encompasses always just reaches with me leaving slight hints of my interest in my verbiage and nothing more potent than that.



I get off from work in the following couple of hours once the arrows stop at five. I share a ‘see you’ with him once again and leave for home. I overanalyze every bit of adjustments I make to my makeup or to my clothing and I dart my eyes a tiresome amount to the clock as it marches closer to the date. I make final alterations to me and leave my house getting into my car driving to his house. I play through it: how our conversations will go like, how our actions will go like, how our feelings will go like, will they be pushed around enough for them to finally tip over staining and spilling all over his carpet or will they stay dormant, am I putting too much allure where it doesn’t belong, is this just a regular get-together without any implications to be perceived or sent out. I guess I’ll find out. I arrive on his street, I exit my car and approach his front door. My bent fingers give way for a knocking to reverberate all around his wooden door. The door soon briskly swings open.



“Hey Carrie, you made it, it’s great to see you, come on inside”

“Hi, it’s good to see you too”



We go inside.



“You look stunning by the way”

“Oh, thank you, I appreciate that”

“I’m sorry about my attire, I feel heavily underdressed""

“No, no you’re fine, you’re home after all, you should be allowed to dress the way you want”

“Yeah, but still… okay come, here take this and sit down wherever you like on the sofa, I’d recommend this side, sofa’s a little lopsided”

“I’m sure it’s not that bad… okay never mind, that side is like sitting on a plank”

“I told you… Alright, the movie is in the DVD player, it's ready to go, but first I want us to do something else, if you don’t mind…”



Is this going to be the implication?



“...Do you wanna take a picture? Just to keep it as a memory of this night”

“Oh, yeah… sure, that’s cool”

“Is everything alright? You seem a little caught off guard”

“Yeah, yeah it’s just…”



I scramble my brain for any excuse that won’t incriminate me.



“...it’s just that I don’t look so great right now, I’m worried about that”  
“That’s not true, you look really beautiful”

“Thank you… so where’s the camera?”



He smiles and takes out a small digital camera from his pocket, he sets it up on the front table and rushes back down next to me.



“It’s on a ten second timer… uh… what should we do? What face should we make?”

“Maybe we should just smile”

“Yeah, but that’s too bas-”



Snap.



“-ic. Darn, it took it”



He leans over, extending his hand across the table, retrieving the camera and turning its screen in our direction.



“I kinda like that actually, you know it’s a first attempt, nothing preplanned or exercised, it just has this level of realness to it”

“You’re right, it does have that authenticity to it. I think this is the one… and with that out of the way are you ready for…for…”



He picks up a CD case, turning it over and looking at the cover. 



“...’unsettled admirers’”



He picks up the remote and the movie starts. The movie was around two hours long. All we did for these two hours was sit and look ahead, sometimes making comments, making noises of crunching, making noises of laughter and then the movie ends. I end up getting up, we end up sharing a hug and I leave out of the door I came in through.



**Perspective Switch**



A day as blend as any, I sit in my kitchen, it’s morning, I’m drinking coffee and reading a newspaper. I look up, down, to the left and right, nothing, but a single piece of advert captures my whole sight and attention. I run through the very last sentence once and afterwards I retrace the words and run through it again and again, I sound the words out:



“Bring us a photograph which includes you in it, taken during the point in past time you want to revisit and we can put you back into your old shoes one or many more times”



I dig deep in my head about the meaning and ultimately the best use I would have for such a trip. I think about fitting the utilization into all aspects of my life, but no matter where my mind trails off to it never can escape a common denominator across all my thoughts. It’s clear how much effect she has on me. It’s clear how much she means to me. It’s clear that my love for her is strong, but my courage is not. My words even as I direct them right for her always manage to swirl going around her big heart. And then I get infected by an idea, which I cannot be cured of… I need a setting, a reason for her to be here, maybe just a friend who wants to hangout…to…watch a movie. Yeah, I’ll pick up something before work. And I think I have my old camera laying around somewhere here. Oh here it is, good. I get dressed and leave my house. I go to the closest video rental store and lounge around eyeing different movie cases down. I’m not exactly sure what I’m looking for, a romance film? Maybe that’s a bit too on the nose. What about horror? What’s this one? I speak quietly under my breath.



“Huh, that’s ironic”



This one’s both romance and horror. I twist it around to read the description. The core concept seems to be about how bad these two characters are at getting their love across, reminds me of someone. I decide to get it. I drive back home to drop the movie off and get dressed properly for work. I drive to work with abnormal levels of spark. She’s the first person visible upon entry, that has to be the primary reason why I’ve kept this dead end job for so long. The moment I lay my eyes on her everyday, I get charged to such an extent that no matter how much this job throws at me, I’m always able to handle it. She’s my battery, she’s my undying star, she’s my life’s source.



“Hi Carrie”

“Hii”

“How was your weekend?”

“Good, good, it was good”

“Nice, I’m happy to hear that”

“Yeah, what about you?”

“Mine was good as well”

“Nice”

“Hey so anyways I was wondering if you’re doing anything tonight?”



Soon after the movie concludes, we get up, we hug and I watch her leave. I close the door and sit back down on my couch, grabbing the camera and looking at the photo as I ponder to myself about that advertisement, what do they mean by “we can put you back into your old shoes”? How? With just a photograph? It’s probably dumb for me to assume that they are being direct, that they’re actually able to do what? Time travel? Are there any chances that their claim might just be real, I wonder? I really don’t know, but… if they are telling the truth why haven’t I heard about this before? Why is the only piece of media linking to them solely a short segment on a piece of paper with a lot of much larger segments on it. I slowly drift off to slumber land unable to successfully confront any of the questions bubbling on my mind’s surface, my eyes close for a while, then they open and I get on the road, on the way to the…memory…place. When I finally arrive at the address pinned to the bottom of that newspaper clipping, I find standing there a boring looking grey building. With zero distinctive marks or even windows. Just a single door right up front, I walk up to it and enter inside. Inside is a hallway with all of its sides including the ceiling and the floor coated in different mashes of different vibrant colors and shapes of all different sizes. I walk to the end of it and find a desk with a chair, a computer on it and a lady sitting at it.



“Hello?”

“What memory would you like to return to?”



I scramble to get the camera from my pocket, I turn it on and go to its gallery, go to one and only picture on the device. I turn the screen towards her.



“This one”



She puts her hand forward at me, gesturing for me to hand her the camera.



“Can I also have your name, gender and age”



“My name is Mark Donnelly, I’m male and twenty-nine years old”



As I speak, she starts typing.



“Okay, now I’m going to hand you a document where I need you to describe the memory inside this image in as much detail as you can. If you don’t know where to begin, I would suggest focusing on your feelings during the moment. Please try to keep the word amount above two hundred”



I take the document and sit down in front of her at the same desk. I pick up a pen and start.



“I know precisely all that I was feeling during this memory. That girl next to me is the love of my life. Being next to her the shell of me is intact, I am contained outside, but inside, inside there’s a live earthquake, a typhoon, there’s a tornado shaking me violently until my shell cracks and outpours the love I hide for her. I don’t know why I am here, I don’t know if this is real, but I have hope that it is, because I…I so desperately want to have the nerve, want to be honest, but I can’t be honest, because I constantly get plagued by a trail of thought, one which fills me with inescapable dread. The idea that there’s a chance for our love to be lopsided, that my side could be whole and hers flat, non-existent. I don’t want to risk alienating her. I do know why I am here, if everything you claim is possible, I’m hoping that confiding my love to her in there will give me the courage I lack out here""



I hand the document back. She starts her typing up again.



“How long would you like the memory to last for? Please also do note that the pricing is dependent on the duration”



The movie was about two hours, right?



“Can I do two hours?”

“Two hours, that comes out to 120 minutes which would equate to 120 dollars, but we always apply a fifty percent discount for first time users. The total comes out to 60 dollars”



“Thank you, please take a seat, I’ll notify you once everything’s prepared”



I sit at one of the seats located in the corner of the waiting room for a couple of minutes, until.



“They’re ready for you, feel free to go through that door”



I get up and walk over to the door she was pointing at. I open it and enter a dark room with just a singular spotlight right in the middle illuminating what appears to be a dentist chair. I walk towards it and lay on it, then a man comes through holding onto an IV pole. He rolls it next to me inserting the tubing into my vein. 



“Try to focus on the memory you’re going back to as much as you can and slowly close your eyes as I begin to count down. Ten… Nine… Eight… Five… Three… tw-”



**Perspective Switch**



I don’t know what it takes for a man to fully lose himself into a beast. Is there just a singular breaking point which you can tie everything back to or is it a myriad of things slowly getting built up in the background and ultimately culminating into the assembly of an inescapable room, room with no doors, room with just narrow unsqueezable windows, which you can only look through, look at the outside, look at where you once stood, look at the people you once were, but you can only look, you can never ever return there ever again. I find myself in the room. I don’t know what path I took to end up here, but I suppose that is of little importance, all that matters now is that I am in here, this is all my existence is now. To go in circles. I’m not a husband anymore, I’m not a writer anymore, I’m just a beast in a loose cage.



“Hey there, would you like a ride?”

“Oh, no…no thank you, my car is right over there”

“Okay… still I don’t mind giving you a ride”

“Thank you really, but I’m alright”

“Okay well, good night”

“Yeah… you too”



I think sometimes even the most rational people get some of the most irrational ideas, which they never actually follow through with, but what happens if you do? Where do you go after going through with the unthinkable? What do you become when all the conventions you’ve blindly been following your whole life crumble away as you drag a random girl along the pavement towards your car just by her hair as she pleads and screams?



“HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GET…GET AWAY FROM…HELP, SOMEBODY HELP ME, HELP…he-”



But your hearing is gone at that moment. You don’t hear her, you don’t hear the world, everything quiets down.



**Perspective Switch** 



“-ic. Darn, it took it”

  
Ever so familiar words slip from my mouth. I open my eyes, I’m in my house, on my couch, next to her. I twist my neck to look at my clock, it’s 7:13 PM. Right before we start watching the movie, what comes next? Right, I grab the camera for us to check the picture out. I twist my head back in the right place, leaning over the table to grab the camera, twisting its digital face to face us.



“I kinda like that actually, you know it’s a first attempt, nothing preplanned or exercised, it just has this level of realness to it”



I feel an ungraspable level of deja vu. I’ve been in this moment before. I reply to her, knowing exactly what I said, what I’m supposed to say.



“You’re right, it does have that authenticity to it. I think this is the one… and with that-”



I cut the script off early. I’m not here to retrace my steps. I put the camera back on the table and turn to her.



“Carrie, I need to tell you something”

“What’s up?”

  
I exhale.



“I… for the longest time… have been in love with you”

“W…What?”

“I don’t have a lot of courage, but I can’t keep my feelings just to me anymore”

“Uh…”



Her pauses make me fear the scenario I’ve expected to unravel. She doesn’t feel for me what I feel for her.



“I’m sorry, forget what I said, o-”



She leans in to kiss me, I kiss her back.



“I’ve been in love with you as well”



There begins to be waves of opposing feelings crushing violently at my inside walls. First came glee, euphoria, exhilaration. Second doubt, uncertainty, suspicion at the legitimacy. This is what I want, what I’ve been wanting for the longest time, but I just can’t allow myself to get fully immersed. She has her face, she has her eyes, her lips, her nose, her hair, her voice, her tenderness, but if this is my interpretation of the memory wouldn’t my mind just make her say just what I want to hear regardless or not if it’s what she wants me to hear from her. But, still this imitation, this lookalike is so flawless, I can’t help myself brush past all my disbeliefs and get fully coaxed by her. We alter my memory, we don’t watch the movie, she doesn’t leave my house, she doesn’t leave my arms. I am in complete serenity and then I get ripped from it just like that, my body isn’t in my house anymore, it’s in that dark room, on that dentist chair, I’m looking right ahead, there’s a girl standing there with a sign, which reads ‘You have 30 seconds left, once you return to your memory please close your eyes for a seamless reintegration’ and without skipping a beat I’m back at my house, back next to her body. I run my fingers through her hair one last time, I kiss her forehead one last time and with a smile close my eyes one last time. I feel the weight of her body dissipate, I feel the firmness which held my body vanish, I reopen my eyes, I’m back in the present. Everyone has left the room, instead there’s a new stand installed right in front of me, there’s my camera on it and a card with text inscribed on it: “Present and future are uncertain, only the past is set in stone. Why hope when you can be certain” I grab both of them and hastily exit through the building. I get in my car and drive to her place straight, definitely over the speed limit. I get there and get out of my vehicle. I look up and down her street and her car doesn’t seem to be anywhere, I walk up to her front door and knock, nothing, I get my cellphone out and call her, nothing, I call the office, nothing.



“She must be out, off the grid”



I get back into my car and try to contain my excitement. I’ve been pumped up on adrenaline ever since the second I reawakened. Which I was hoping to expel through confessing my love to Carrie, but she’s not there. Maybe this is good, it gives more time to put my thoughts in proper order, or maybe this prolonging will just make the doubts creep into me once more.



I went into work tomorrow, ready to see her face, as I peered into the front door. She’s not there. It’s unlike her to miss work. Maybe she’s sick? I try calling her, no answer. I don’t know who else to turn to, she’s a loner like me, no family, no friends. I drive by her house, still no car. Then came tomorrow and after tomorrow and after and after and after. No one batted an eye? Does no one care? Am I the only one who has noticed? I try to be rational, but the only phone line which comes to mind to contact is…



**Perspective Switch** 



“Did you get the timeline of events?”

“Yes, On June 5th he invited the missing person in question over to his house, she got to his house at around 8 o’clock, they would watch a movie together for the following 2 hours and afterwards she would leave, that’s the last time he would see her. Now this where it all gets strange, he put a great deal of importance on a certain detail, which is that right before they would begin watching the film, he would take a photograph of the two, he actually brought the camera with him, I have it right here. Now the reason as to why, that’s the actual strange part. He said that he took the photo so he could use it to travel back to that moment once again. A day before this gathering, he would come across an advert in a newspaper allegedly about a place which allows you to experience memories once again, as long as you provide them an image depicting the memory you want to revisit. The next day he would travel to that place and revisit that picture he took the night prior, after he came back…to the…past he would try to reach her, call her, go to her house, but to no avail, a couple of days would pass and she still wouldn’t reappear and that’s what brought him here today…oh and here, he gave me a card from that place, it’s got an address on it if you wanna check it out”



**Perspective Switch** 



A door opens. A door closes.



“Hey honey, where were you?”



Another door opens and closes.



What’s wrong? He’s been so distant and quiet lately. Did something happen? Why won’t he ever talk to me? I’ve been the closest person to him for well over two decades now, it’s just been me and him for so long. We’ve never had any kind of problems which has in turn shut him out from me to this extent. Is it the burnout you get from talking or looking at the same face for such an extended period. He used to always share everything with me, all of his feelings, all of his wants and desires, all of his writings, but now I don’t think he even enjoys writing anymore or that he desires anything anymore or that he feels anything anymore for anything, not for me, not for the world. It’s like he's all together an entirely different being now.

“Hello, I’m detective Reeves this is my partner Rogers”

“Hi, officers… what brings you here?”

“Greetings, we’re investigating a potential missing person’s case. This card is precisely what brings us here, it came from the last person who allegedly saw the missing person, we just wanted to match our timeline of events with yours”

“Of course, I’ll help in any way I can”

“Good… so could you check for us if there was a Mark Donnelly here on…just a second…the sixth of this month”

“...Yes a Mark Donnelly was here on that date”

“Is this him?”

“Yes”

“Is it also the picture he used for the…uh…”

“Yes, that is the memory he re-experienced""

“Could you explain the process for us? That is of the re-experiencing""

“We offer anyone for a small fee to be transported back to any memory of their choice, only requirement being a photograph of any one of their memories, but the revisiting can only work if the picture you supply us with actually contains you in it, if not that you’re at least connected to it somehow”

“I think we got that part, the outline of it all, but what does it mean to re-experience a memory exactly?”

“I see a lot of people here from all walks of life, all of them give the re-experiencings a different meaning. There’s a man who broke a woman’s heart, so he comes here now to see her again and again and many, many mores time, to see the version of her which hasn’t been hurt, version which never will get hurt, version which will never develop disdain, she’s a perfectly reserved snippet of happiness for him. There’s another man, a forgetful one, his journeys into the past are all for him to pay more attention, than he actually did living through them once. To see the aspects of his memories, he either has forgotten or missed on the first attempt living through them. We don’t offer a way for you to temper with the past in any way, all we offer and we offer everyone the exact same, is a chance for you to go through the exact locations, exact people, exact hours, exact colors again, the meaning you ask of, that’s for you to come up with, we’re just the conductor of a train with the only passenger on it being you and with us guiding you to the destination past""

A door opens. A door closes.



“Steven…Steven look at me…Why do you always get home so late? Why do you always walk past me when you finally get home? Why do you never talk to me anymore? Did I do something wrong? Tell me, please tell me, I’m sorry if I did something…just say something… please…just FUCKING SAY something…no, no come back here, come back here NOW. What…What are you doing? That hurts. Ah…stop, Steven stop…STOP”



He’s never laid a finger on me before. This isn’t the man I fell in love with, it’s not even close, this being, this beast is just that, a beast, just some vial being with my husband's skin stitched all over itself. I get these kinds of thoughts, but I come back to sense afterwards pretty quickly. I’m wrong, this is just some phase, everything will get back to normal, I love this man, the least I can do is have patience for him to work through his troubles. Yeah, that’s what I’ll do, everything will resemble normalcy soon enough. I just know it. I believe it.

From that moment on, Mitchell and I became mortal enemies.
He drove a car straight into my father’s funeral.
I smashed his mother’s urn on the dock and scattered her ashes into the sea.
Our hatred consumed us, sharp and venomous. We spent ten years wounding each other until we finally wore ourselves out.
He took his crew and left for Mexico.
I stayed in New York and became the city's most sought-after bounty hunter.
But when we met again years later, he was neither my enemy nor the boy I once knew.
He walked into the morgue—into the room where I was lying.
Years later, we finally got the chance to faced each other in silence.

After finishing my job, I hurried back to the small bakery I used as a front to tend to my injuries.
The wall-mounted TV showed Mitchell Harvey's return.
The former golden boy of New York's elite circles, now Mexico's top arms dealer, was back in town. Of course, it was headline news.
I roughly bandaged my wound and moved toward the small memorial corner I kept for my father.
Suddenly, a girl with chin-length hair burst into the shop.
She looked serious but spoke loudly. Clutching red roses, she pointed at the display case. ""I'll take everything here!""
Close behind was Roderick Dunlap, Mitchell's best friend and right-hand man.
When he saw me, he froze, his expression tightening. ""Yas, maybe we should go somewhere else?""
The girl refused immediately. ""No way!
""I brought Mitch desserts from here before. He said they were amazing. It's his birthday today. I need to get more.""
She gave me a pleading look. ""Ma'am, my fiancé's returning today. He loves your pastries. Could I use your space for a birthday surprise?""
I couldn't refuse, so I nodded.
""Could we get some extra desserts?"" she asked.
I agreed, noticing my fresh bandage was already bleeding through.
I hid my hand under my apron and walked unsteadily toward the kitchen.
It wasn't fear or nostalgia.
My illness was flaring up again.
It was incurable.
""Roderick, we're running out of time! Help me set up! Mitch's gonna be here any minute, and I want everything perfect.""
Roderick didn't move.
He knew Mitchell was never happy to see me.
On the news broadcast, Mitchell smiled for the cameras, yet his eyes remained cold.
""I'm sure she's watching too. I'm looking forward to... seeing her again.""
 
###Chapter 2
The camera zoomed in, highlighting the scar bisecting his eyebrow.
It was my doing, with a knife.
I was having a bad day, and he was there. So, I attacked him.
The ugly scar on my neck was his doing. He crushed a glass and used a shard to attack me.
Again, there was no deep motive.
We had a simple understanding: hurt the other, get hurt in return. We liked seeing each other in pain.
The news anchor smiled suggestively. ""Planning a long stay, Mr. Harvey? Those roses... Are you meeting someone special?""
He paused, his voice low. ""My fiancée.""
In the shop, the girl was adjusting roses in a candelabra. She glanced up at the TV.
""Roderick,"" she said, ""I heard Mitch had some messy history with a girl here for ten years. You know anything about that?""
I kept my head down, polishing a knife, but felt Roderick's gaze flicker toward me.
""Mitch!"" Her shout cut through the tension.
She forgot her umbrella and dashed outside.
""Yas.""
Mitchell caught her in a one-armed hug, his umbrella shielding her from the rain.
She rose on her toes and pressed a quick, rain-damp kiss to his lips.
I thought I saw him lean back, just slightly.
Then his eyes found mine through the wet glass.
The girl tried to turn, but he cupped her chin and kissed her again, deeper this time.
I looked away and snipped the ribbon I was holding.
Roderick approached.
""Paulette,"" he said, voice low. ""It's his birthday. For one night, could you just not anger him?""
He hesitated, seeming to think of something. ""She's nineteen. Clean slate. Reminds him of you before.""
I nodded, my fingers feeling numb.
""She's pretty. Prettier than I was.""
The door opened. Mitchell stood there, folding his black umbrella.
""Discussing my fiancée?""
His tone was light, but his stare was cold as it rested on me.
 
###Chapter 3
Roderick watched me, holding his breath.
He was waiting for one of my classic outbursts.
Instead, I simply pushed the boxed cake toward them. ""Your dark chocolate cheesecake.""
Yasmine Murphy gazed at Mitchell with adoration. ""Try it, Mitch. Is this your favorite?""
He took a sip of coffee, rubbing the edge of the cup, before cutting a small piece with the silver dessert fork.
""Bitter. Unpleasantly so. Not for me.""
His tone was light, his eyes smiling as he teased Yasmine.
She looked confused and took a bite herself. ""It's delicious! You're lying to me again!""
She didn't see that his gaze remained fixed on me over her head.
Suddenly, the door chime jangled loudly.
""Hey, Mitch! Welcome back!""
A few men crowded in, their laughter cutting off abruptly when they saw me.
Their eyes followed me, wary and questioning, before turning to Roderick.
I carried over the pot of lemonade. The men flinched in unison, raising their hands defensively, as if I were holding acid.
Back when Mitchell and I were at each other's throats, his crew got caught in the crossfire a few times.
It was never anything serious, just minor incidents. I was surprised they still reacted this way.
Someone nudged Roderick. ""Roddy, what's she doing here?""
Roderick just shrugged, not explaining.
""Enjoy your lemonade,"" I said, turning to leave.
Yasmine caught my wrist. ""Wait! Could you take a picture for us?""
""No,"" I said, calmly removing her hand.
I'd only taken a few steps when a figure moved to block my path.
I looked up to see Mitchell's gloomy face. ""I know how this works,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Everything has a price. So name it. How much to get you to...""
He paused deliberately, waiting for me to react. When I didn't, he finished coldly. ""Take a picture for us.""
I looked him over and tried to step around him.
A sharp pressure on a nerve in my arm sent a jolt of pain through me, and my legs gave way. I fell to my knees. A black card was flung down, its edge catching my cheek and drawing a thin line of blood.
""That's more than enough to make you disappear.""
I pushed myself back to my feet, my fingers gingerly touching the cut, my eyes fixed on Mitchell.
Yasmine quickly stepped between us, her smile strained. ""Mitch, stop it, okay?
""Sorry, miss. He must have had too much to drink.""
But he didn't smell of alcohol. He was simply picking a fight, same as always.
It convinced me he'd been having such a good time abroad that he'd forgotten who he was dealing with.
I bent down, picked up the black card, and stood facing him again.
His friends let out a low laugh.
""Some things never change. She still jumps for money.""
He held out his phone with a confident smirk, pleased by my apparent cooperation.
I moved fast. I grabbed his jaw, scraped the edge of the card through a thick glob of chocolate frosting, and shoved it into his mouth.
I didn't stop until I smelled blood. Then I grabbed two glasses from the table and poured the liquor down his throat.
""Consider your mouth cleaned,"" I said.
I turned and slapped the man who had spoken. ""Learn when to keep quiet.""
The whole thing was over in seconds. No one else moved. The only sound was the rain hitting the windows.
Roderick, leaning against the far wall, drained his glass and sighed heavily. ""I told you not to provoke her.""
Yasmine finally snapped out of her shock, her posture defensive as she confronted me. ""We were out of line first. I get it. But this is just insane!""
She raised her hand to strike me.
""Ah!"" I caught her wrist mid-swing and slapped her, hard, across the face.
The sound was sharp in the quiet room.
Mitchell spat out a mix of blood and frosting, a cold smile on his lips. ""You want a fight with me? Fine. But you can't touch her.""
He pulled the sobbing Yasmine close, her cheek still swollen from the slap. ""How about I trash this place for you? Will that make you feel better?""
She nodded and covered her cheek, tears in her eyes.
His bodyguards in black swarmed in. Clubs swung down, shattering glass and smashing the overhead light.
Cold wind and rain blew through the broken windows, soaking my face.
Mitchell gripped my chin, forcing my head up.
""You didn't start this. But she needs to see it end. Send me the bill for the damages. All of it.""
His eyes scanned me like I was a piece of discarded furniture.
I shoved his hand away, a sudden coughing fit seizing me. I frantically searched through the wreckage.
A small white prescription bottle rolled into view. My eyes locked onto it.
He was faster. He bent down and plucked it, reading the label.
""Six of these at once? Are you trying to kill yourself?""
He tossed the bottle into a rainwater puddle, put his arm around Yasmine, and walked away.
I knelt by the puddle, retrieved the bottle, and swallowed two more pills.
This medication was for anxiety and pain.
I started with half a pill. Now, eight couldn't stop my pain.
The pills were nearly gone. And so was I.
 
###Chapter 4
Three years passed, and my mother died too.
My work was unstable. I'd taken many lives and become a target myself.
I'd spent all my savings on that bakery. Now, with it destroyed, I had nowhere left to go.
Maybe it was the pain seizing my limbs again, but I lacked the strength to move. I simply sat amidst the wreckage, letting the rain soak me.
Overnight, every major tabloid in New York led with ""Mitchell Harvey Returns to Wreak Havoc on His Ex.""
By sunrise, I was ready to leave.
Before going, I faced the shattered ruins and slowly bowed.
Mitchell appeared out of nowhere. He hauled me to my feet with one hand.
""It's just a bakery. Is it worth this?""
I slapped his hand away, steadied myself, and then struck him three sharp slaps across the face.
""My parents' memorial plaques were inside. They're gone now,"" I said, my voice flat. ""The bow was necessary.""
He worked his jaw, then smirked. ""Three slaps for your mother's memorial? Sounds like I got the better deal.""
I ignored him, staring at the devastation.
He stood behind me, deliberately twisting the knife.
""Paulette Sherman. I'm talking to you.""
I acted as if I hadn't heard and walked away.
He caught up in a few strides, blocking my path.
""Stop pretending you're fine! Look at yourself. You're ghostly pale. What are you trying to prove?""
""My old condition flared up. A little tired, that's all."" I looked up, offering a cold smile. ""Mitchell, did you really think you were important enough to affect me?""
But I knew the truth.
He'd come back specifically to make my life hell.
If I were still in good health, I wouldn't mind another round, maybe breaking a few of his bones in the process.
But now, just standing upright consumed all my energy.
In the hospital, the smell of disinfectant was nauseating.
Several doctors studied my scans, their expressions grim.
""How much of your last prescription is left?""
""It's gone.""
""Gone?!"" Steven Harriman's voice rose sharply. ""That was a three-month supply! It's only been a week!""
Steven had handled my case for years. His hesitation told me everything—my time was running out.
""Is... there anyone else in your family?"" he asked carefully.
""Have you forgotten?"" My tone was flat. ""My father's dead. My mother's gone. It's just me.""
He removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""You were managing well for three years. What happened this past week...""
My phone screen lit up with a news alert—a prominent photo of Mitchell with Yasmine on his arm at some gala.
The person I thought I was over still hurt me the most.
Mitchell was the source of my deepest wounds, the one who knew how to hurt me most without leaving a mark.
""Your condition is extremely unstable. After stopping the medication, the first week, the first month, and the third month are all critical periods.
""Take this,"" he said, handing me a small bottle. His voice was heavy. ""Three pills when the pain is severe. No more than three.""
Before he finished, I'd twisted the cap off, shaken a handful into my palm, and dry-swallowed them.
The number didn't matter, as long as it dulled the bone-deep agony.
A week or three months made no difference to me.
After taking the pills, I crouched in the most inconspicuous corner of the hospital corridor, my back pressed against the cold wall.
I'd figured out that lowering my body temperature could ease the pain.
Cold sweat soaked through my thin clothes.
For ten minutes, I listened to the desperate prayers and weeping outside the operating room, where all hope hung on a single, fragile thread.
""Mommy, isn't that the lady who was in the bed next to us? Should we say goodbye?""
""Her illness... There's no cure. Let's not bother her. Such a tragic case. No family left, and such a severe sickness. She probably won't even have anyone to hold a funeral for her.""
The little girl looked up, confused. ""But surely someone in the world cares about her, right?""
I blinked hard, clearing my blurred vision, and focused on my phone screen.
A text came from Mitchell.
He'd been messaging since last night, persistently asking what compensation I wanted.
I thought about it. Maybe no one cared, but there was one person who could handle the funeral arrangements.
I dialed the number I knew by heart.
He answered instantly.
""Made up your mind?""
I took a sharp breath, swallowing the metallic taste in my mouth. ""If you insist on paying me back, Mitchell, you can be the one to bury me.""
 
###Chapter 5
Silence stretched for seconds on the other end, followed by Mitchell's mocking laugh.
""Paulette, someone as vicious and stubborn as you usually lives forever. But if you do somehow die before me, rest assured, I'll give you the most lavish funeral New York has ever seen. I'll have the whole city light memorial candles for you!""
Satisfied with his promise, I hung up.
Outside the hospital, I saw the mother and daughter again.
The little girl was pounding her chest, her voice full of childish conviction. ""Who says nobody cares about her just because she has no family? Well, I do!""
""Enough, let's go. The bus is. Oh, the bus!"" Her mother pulled her away, rushing for the departing bus.
I walked to the parking garage and got into my black sedan.
Seeing they'd missed the bus, I impulsively rolled down the window. ""Get in. I'll give you a ride.""
I dropped them off downtown. They thanked me profusely and got out.
Just as I was about to pull away, I heard an irritating voice.
""Well, look at that. Paulette did a good deed. I suppose even you need to score some points.""
Mitchell's usual crowd was exiting a nearby club. Yasmine clung to his arm, her gaze sharp and venomous.
I didn't want a scene. I started raising the window to leave.
But Yasmine hurried over and pressed her hand against the glass.
A fake smile played on her lips, but her eyes were cold. ""I just found out about your history with Mitch. I hope we didn't... upset you yesterday?""
I had no patience for her act and tried to close the window again.
She gripped the window frame tightly. ""I have something for you. I really mean no harm.""
""I'm not interested. Get lost."" My patience was gone.
Yasmine suddenly let go. As I started the car, she pulled a small urn from her bag.
""I heard your mother's memorial plaque was destroyed in the shop. I gathered some ashes from the ruins this morning so you'd have something to remember her by.""
Her voice was sweet, but her actions were pure malice.
She reached through the window and poured the contents of the urn onto my passenger seat.
""Oh! You... you didn't catch it!"" she cried, stepping back with a perfect mask of innocence and sly satisfaction. ""You're not mad at me, are you?""
I watched her performance, and a sudden anger burned through the sickness inside me.
Good. She asked for this.
The group by the club entrance, clueless, was still praising Yasmine. ""Yas is so thoughtful, talking to that mess and even giving her a gift.""
Yasmine confidently turned and walked towards a shiny new Porsche parked ahead, triumphantly shaking her key fob.
I rolled down my window and called out, ""Yasmine! I have a gift for you, too!""
Yasmine turned, crossing her arms smugly. ""What are you giving me, Paulette?""
I tightened my seatbelt, my eyes locking on her. ""A one-way trip.""
Before the words faded, I slammed the accelerator.
""Bang!""
The front of my car smashed into the Porsche's rear.
Yasmine's car lurched forward uncontrollably.
I reversed, then slammed the gas again, hitting it a second time!
In the rearview mirror, I saw the drunken group jolt into sobriety.
""She's insane! She's actually insane!""
""I told you she was a lunatic! But you had to provoke her!""
""Relax, she won't really do anything. She's just blowing off steam, and then...""
He didn't finish.
True, I was blowing off steam.
But I wasn't done yet.
Yasmine stumbled out of the smoking car, her face pale, already slipping back into her fragile victim role.
""Mitch, wh... what did I do wrong?""
Mitchell had a cut on his forehead from flying glass, bleeding slightly. He moved urgently to shield Yasmine.
He understood my intent in a single glance.
""Paulette! Don't you dare!""
Ridiculous. There was nothing I dared not do.
I kept my eyes on Yasmine, my expression icy, and floored the accelerator.
The engine roared as the car shot straight toward her.
 
###Chapter 6
I unbuckled my seatbelt, got out, and coldly observed Yasmine sprawled on the pavement a few yards away.
Her legs and arms were scraped and bleeding.
""You're lucky I let off the gas. Otherwise, you'd have more than scratches,"" I stated calmly.
She looked up, her eyes filled with naked hatred. ""Mitchell will make you pay for this!""
I picked up my handbag from the passenger seat, now soiled with the ashes, and used its corner to lift her chin. ""There. The real you is much more tolerable.""
I took the bag back, dusting it off with disgust. The group rushed over.
Mitchell hurried to help Yasmine up.
I took out my phone, called an ambulance, then tossed the handbag toward Yasmine.
""This bag's resale value is about 20,000 dollars. More than enough for her medical bills and the car repairs.""
""Paulette!"" Mitchell's voice was thick with suppressed rage.
I ignored him and walked away.
The taste of blood filled my mouth. I pressed my lips together and quickened my pace.
I nearly ran from the scene. Rounding a corner, sure I was out of sight, I braced myself against a wall and coughed, splattering dark blood onto the grimy brick.
A ringing filled my ears, my vision blurring. I forced myself onward, moving on instinct until I reached my temporary apartment.
If my body had held up, I might have turned back to cause Mitchell more trouble. I desperately wanted to see him furious and helpless against me.
I collapsed near the living room coffee table and poured a glass of water.
But after one sip, I coughed it all back up—water and blood.
The half-glass of water instantly turned crimson.
I lay on the floor, gasping for air. It felt like an invisible hand was twisting my insides. The pain was maddening, but I lacked even the strength to clench my teeth.
I had no idea how much time had passed before the buzzing of my phone and violent pounding on my door dragged me back to consciousness.
For a moment, I'd thought I wouldn't make it through the night.
The name flashing on the screen was Mitchell.
""Paulette! Open the door! I know you're in there!""
His voice came through, threatening and absolute, while the door thumped under his force.
""If you don't open it, I'll break it down!""
I knew he meant it. But I would never let him see me like this—broken and dying.
Summoning the last of my strength, I crawled into the bedroom, moved the wardrobe, and squeezed into the narrow hiding space behind it. The sound of the door being forced open echoed from outside, followed by hurried footsteps.
His texts flooded my screen, one after another.
""Hiding? You think that works?"" ""Get out of here! We need to talk!"" ""If anything happens to Yasmine, I'll make you pay with your life!"" I stared at my phone. A sudden drop of nosebleed hit the screen, forming a dark red stain. My consciousness faded.*",2,1765139786.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Can't drink tea which is considered healthy but can drink energy drinks which is unhealthy 

The Word of wisdom is supposed to keep us healthy, but who's more healthy, a 400 pound man who eats fast food everyday and doesn't drink tea or coffee. Or a super fit and healthy person BUT they drink tea. The person that's following the WoW is fat and unhealthy but the other person is fit and drinks tea. God probably doesn't see weight and sees that one followed the WoW and one didn't so he sees the fat guy as someone who follows him. But the whole point of the WoW is to stay healthy, so who's really the one who's following the WoW

we are taught that we will become Gods (dnc 132 15-20) but in the bible it doesn't teach that, it says that there are no other God other then God himself (Isaiah 45:5, 43:10)                                            

Also in Abraham 4:1, it says Gods organized the heavens and earth. but only God did. this also contradicts Isaiah 45:5

1pgstz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1pgstz8/testers_wanted_for_an_etl_sqlite_based_paas_go/,"Testers wanted for an ETL / sqlite based PaaS (Go, OSS, API + web dev)","First off, I'm an engineer that did a lot of work on scaling, and in recent years, open source. I published https://github.com/titpetric/etl months if not years before I picked up AI for the first time. I wrote a lot of code in various runtimes and business domains but use Go exclusively for many years now. For anything.

My recent obsession with AI (in a measured way, unlike my obsession with coffee), lead me down a chain of writing supportive tooling like a template engine that works with hot-loading, follows Vue syntax and let's me do back end templating in a familiar style. Convenience is king, and for me, convenience only means the go runtime, none of this node/npm ecosystem chaos, no scaling issues, and no needing to patch language syntax. If I had written it a few years ago, I wouldn't have fs.FS, or generics, or iterators, and really the only concerns go code is left with is optimizing software design to new abstractions.

I implemented etl as a simple CLI, which grew into a server, where you would with a yaml configuration define a full API for your service, directly implementing the api with SQL. I added sqlite, mysql, and postgres, considering user choice. It enabled creating REST style APIs like /api/users/{id}, and spitting out the SELECT statement result as the response json.

Now I realize this is where AI accelerated me somewhat ; I added an additional handler that is able to invoke the API endpoint returning json and feed it to the template, which can now be defined in the yaml config. Additionally I asked for a rate limiter, defined the data models, extended tests, along my overlay of design, architectural and testing concerns. Software is never perfect, but iterative.

Why do you care? Well, here is where it gets interesting. Using sqlite I can simplify my database management (no connection pools and other limitations), meaning I'm only limited by disk and I can set very predictable quotas.

50mb per would partition a 500gb so many times that a single server could handle thousands of users.

Using the .yml gives me a sandboxed but unified execution environment, memory wise it can live even on a low memory instance serving tens of thousands of requests per second.

So my main problem is, is the SQL in yaml approach expressive enough? Can it build large composable systems? For this, I need testers. I can build and design apps on my own, and use this in process, sure, but the true step forward is someone that wants to do something with data. The more someone's I have, I can see how this scales with real use with various applications that you could choose to model with SQL.

What's in it for you? I can partition some cloud resources that give you an always on API that's driven by an sqlite database. You could have a dashboard that queries data from sqlite, renders to JSON or HTML, has cached responses and configurable rate limits.

What's in it for me? I obviously don't care about market validation, more about the process. In the past I've relied too much on php, node and even go to implement APIs, always sort of falling back on the same operational problems. That being said, a PaaS that's cost effective to run for this setup mainly needs to account for data durability, the traffic itself is an ""add more nodes"" problem. Since it's a shared runtime environment the number of running processes per server is 1, per any amount of users. I love it.

It's kind of hosting, but it's really lightweight, so don't think there's a cutoff ; 10gb of storage is 50mb x 200, so lets make it anywhere from 200-500 users. Not to be bill gates and say 50mb is enough for everyone, but I can bump the quota, the only thing I can't support is *endless growth*, at which point we have a discussion.

The limiting factor is cpu. Cpu I suspect will be most used if you're doing statistics or querying the service without caching or limits. As you can configure those, not much concern it left.

Anyone willing to help in any way is welcome to reach out to me@titpetric.com, put ETL in the subject, like ""I'd like an ETL server shard"".

Don't expect an immediate response, but if you include some detail as to what you'd use it for, it may get your onboarding fast tracked. Of course, you can build the docker image and start in your homelab, file any github issues, PRs.

Thank you for consideration. I'm really discovering the use cases and limitations here, and figuring that out is a people problem. I need people to poke holes in the design, point out edge cases.

Disclaimer: the project is OSS, the server is self hosting, written in Go, and I'd like to share this much as Linus Torvalds would (free as in beer).

I would add an AI policy, but other than ""I trust it as far as I can throw it"" the nuances of working with AI in my case only equate to my own dominion over it's output, it's not a shortcut for thinking things through. We both make errors. I lean into linting and detailed testing with test fixtures to mitigate regession, as I would for my own code. I favour composition. I haven't seen a policy on AI use much as I haven't seen policies for working with other devs, but I imagine they would be about the same. I'm having the same corrective reviews either way, that's what you get from the average distribution of model training data.

1pgstq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pgstq2/we_do_not_need_to_be_found/,We do not need to be found,"This is Dr. Lennox Miller, chief biologist of Exo 9. If you’re reading this the station has already been depressurized and the trench has folded us back into itself. I have been asked to keep this to a formal incident report but there’s no time for an autopsy of procedures. What you need is the story before the last pumps change pitch and the walls begin to sing. You need to know why I sign my name beneath the order to destroy what we built.

I am writing from Comms, hatch locked, knees braced against the slight tremor of the wall that separates me from the sea. There’s a smear of algae on the bulkhead by my shoulder. Don’t worry, this one is just algae. I tested it. I still test things afterall that’s what got us here.

I’ll start at the beginning then go as far as I can toward the end.

We pulled the sample on a Thursday. Saturation time in the trench messes with you. Days come in shades of low hums and motor noise rather than sun. But I remember the Thursday because Mike, our ROV pilot, found something extraordinary that day.

The arm snagged a sheet of odd, translucent material beneath the sand. Not the sulfur-eating microbes we love. This swayed and snapped back with the water’s slow breath. The ROV camera caught it in the headlamps: pale as frost on glass, veined like leaf skeleton. Mike murmured, “Fishing net?” and I said, “No net quivers.” and we both leaned in.

“Renfro” I called into the lab intercom “prep Iso Two.”

Dr. Sarah Renfro, singularly brilliant and perennially a little late to every meal, answered with a prompt, “On it.” When we wheeled the dredge basket into the wet lab and opened its lid, the thing lay there like a small banner with ribbons of it weightless in the brine.

We lifted one ribbon with a sterilized loop and moved it to Isolation Bay Two. On contact with the glass, it clung, as if static ran through seawater. Under the microscope it was like intricate architecture. Braided filaments inside hollow tubes, junctions that looked like knots but slid when teased, and at each junction clusters of cells as fine as silk. I’d never seen a multicellular organism organize communication lines like that. Sarah’s eyes lit up.

“It’s a nervous system pretending to be a plant.” she said.

We sampled a fragment into a test tube, added staining dyes and watched. The dye spread along the internal tubes then pulsed back like peristalsis. A fluid nervous system, we joked. We were as giddy as children. We named it *Medusa,* a placeholder, a nod to myth.

At dinner (improvised dumplings by Jordan, our cook), the crew leaned toward my tablet as I pinched and zoomed through images. Shane, the chief engineer, laughed in a way where his exhale became an approving hum. “Clever seamstress.” he said. “Maybe it can knit us a sweater.”

“Knits just fine” Sarah said. “It’s already interfacing with the glass. Glues itself down with a protein we haven’t seen before.”

“And it twitches if you dim the lights.” Mike added.

Mason, our diver and safety officer, rolled his eyes. “Everything twitches if you stare at it long enough.”

We argued about whether it could be from a vent field no one had mapped. I said it’s a scavenger. Sarah said colonial animal. Shane said alien as a joke and then we laughed harder than it deserved because everything down here is alien until you catalog it.

I logged my notes, set the sample on a slow time-lapse and went to sleep hearing the station. A steady respiration. Compressors in the walls, CO₂ scrubbers like distant rain. I slept well. These are sounds of comfort to me now.

The next morning, Sarah didn’t smile when I brought her coffee. She took it, said “Thanks.” Peering into the microscope with the focus of a surgeon. Not smiling was not unusual, we were all short on sleep and long on tasks. But it still ate at me. Later, I tried to ease the tension and asked “Does it dance when you dim the lights, stage director?” She looked up with pupils wide and said, “It’s more responsive when the room is bright. Or when there’s movement.”

“Chemotaxis?” I asked.

“Maybe.” She turned back. “It binds to anything with a field.” She meant charged membranes and living cells. She didn’t elaborate and Sarah always elaborates. I recall leaving the lab thinking she’d argued with someone. Who? We were only twelve souls down here. We kept our fights small.

By afternoon, Mike reported a hiccup in power distribution. Dimming and small outages in the station grid when he was in the ROV bay. “Like somebody’s flipping a little switch.” he said. Shane shrugged and said he’d check the fuses. He didn’t smile either. It was a small absence but, in hindsight, it was the hole in the hull through which the ocean begins to whisper.

At midnight I stopped by Iso Two to check on the sample. The room’s observation window reflected me. I hardly recognized myself curly hair flattened, eyes red. Behind the glass, the ribbon had spread into a veneer over the inner wall, a thin frost traced with veins. It looked like a leaf pressed flat. When I walked left, the veins nearest me brightened and then dimmed. I walked right and they followed. I told myself it was coincidence. I lifted my hand and the veins nearest it brightened again. A group of junctions near the floor opened then closed.

I went back to my bunk with a new name on my tongue. Not *Medusa but Aes Cyprium*, after the Latin word for copper. After the way it liked fields, currents, our bodies.

Saturday, if we keep pretending the calendar means something, brought a water filtration alarm. Jordan cursed, which was reassuring in its normalcy, and Mason, with a double espresso only he could know how to make so smooth, banged toward the maintenance access behind the galley. I followed because I am a biologist and because that’s where the water loops pass the labs.

We found the filter assembly open. Not burst, not worn but opened with intent. The mesh cartridges lay arranged like bones on the grate. Several were punctured, neat circles inside with Aes Cyprium in the centers. A handful of copper wire clippings glittered in a tidy crescent. Mason’s mouth went thin. “Who was in here last?”

Shane appeared without footsteps. He had that gift and could surprise you like a tiger in tall grass. “I was.” he said flatly. “I needed to reroute for the ROV winch. There was a voltage spike.”

“You bypassed the filters for a voltage spike?” Mason’s voice escalated.

“I bypassed the filters for testing” Shane said, as if that resolved it. He looked at our hands and our faces. His eyes lingered on my wrist, where my watch buzzed with an unseen notification. No smile. No shrug. No apology. Which is unlike Shane, who apologized for a mislaid screw once as if that was the source of all problems.

“We’ll fix it” he said. “We need to be found.”

“What?” I asked.

“Nothing.” he said.

After he left, Mason rubbed a hand over his chin. “You hear that?” he asked.

“I heard the words.” I said.

“We need to be found” he repeated, imitating Shane’s expressionless demeanor as if reading directly from a card. He met my eyes. “That’s wrong.”

We replaced the filters. We logged the incident. We asked Shane to log his work orders before he did any more “tests.” He nodded, and the nod felt like a yes cut from a template.

That night, I messaged Sarah on the general chat. No answer. I walked to the lab and found her at the workbench, capping a vial of saline with precise, smooth motions. “Sarah, you missed the shift briefing.” I said.

“I needed to finish this.” she said, not looking up.

“What is it?”

“Exposure trial.” she said. Before I could respond, she turned to me with no fidgeting. Sarah always fidgeted. Pencil to lips, knee bouncing, tapping a finger on her desk. She looked at me. “It has symbionts.” she said. “Tiny ones. They build Aes Cyprium.”

“Symbionts like bacteria?”

She nodded. “Like tiny armies.”

I stepped closer to the observation window. Inside, the ribbon had thickened. On the glass was a faint hand print where someone had steadied themselves. Five finger shaped shadows within the veneer, fussed with feathered lines. “Who touched the glass?” I asked.

“Shane.” she said.

“Why?”

She shrugged her shoulders. “We need to be found.”

Chills shot up my back.

“Sarah” I said, breaking the moment with volume. “What’s the exposure protocol?”

She blinked, slowly. “Full hazmat from the Isolation bays. Bleach, UV, heat.”

“And for us?”

Another slow blink. “Wash hands. Sleep. Don’t touch your face.”

She set the vial down, the cap aligned with the label in a way that made me want to knock it askew just to see if she noticed. The fluorescent lights flickered. Somewhere in the facility, a hatch latch snapped, the sound carried by metal. Ordinary sounds, now loud enough to magnify a feeling even people on the surface know. The feeling of being watched.

We had a meeting. Twelve of us around the table with coffee mugs in hand. Lead researcher Samantha—the kind of woman whose voice was loud enough to be heard in any room, opened her log and said, “We have a hazard. I want proposals, not panic.”

Mike suggested we freeze the organism. Sarah said cold slowed it but didn’t stop it. “It senses environmental changes” she said, voice dull. “It rides them.” Medic Holly asked for a working definition of rides. Sarah folded her hands, fingers interlaced. “It moves along potentials. Surfaces. Charge differences. It can follow.”

“Follow what?” Jordan asked, daring someone to describe a ghost.

“Us.” Sarah said.

“Are we talking about infection?” Samantha asked.

“Contact transmission appears likely.” Sarah said. “No overt symptoms observed in hosts.” She paused on the word, like it were taboo. “Except a flattening.”

“Flattening?” Samantha asked.

“Affect.” I said quietly, because the word was failing all of us. “Emotion. Facial expression.”

The eyes in the room turned toward certain people. Shane, who stared at the table’s edge as if it were a desert mirage. Sarah, whose stillness was like the calm before a storm. Steve from Comms, who hadn’t laughed at Jordan’s pun earlier and always laughed at Jordan’s puns. Even Samantha’s lips were tighter than usual though authority trains you out of certain tells.

“We will institute a decontamination protocol.” Samantha said. “Restricted access to Iso Two. No one goes alone. We cycle a smoke test through the ventilation loops to check for leaks.” Her eyes moved to Shane. “We lock engineering. No unsanctioned tests.”

Shane nodded. “We need to be found.” he said, and then added as if remembering “If needed, I mean. If we’re in trouble.”

“Are we in trouble?” Samantha asked.

“Yes.” Shane said.

We broke, messy, like always chairs skidding, mugs leaving rings. Holly lingered by me. “You notice Shane’s pupils?” she whispered.

“Dilated.” I said.

“Light responsiveness is normal.” she said. “His are slow to constrict. Like they’re seeing something we’re not.”

The smoke test revealed two vents tampered with. Valves disabled, filters pulled. Steve went drained of all color when Samantha confronted him. “I don’t remember doing that.” he said, flat. He repeated it when we showed him the video feed timestamps. Then he asked for water, drank it steadily and sat the cup down so the rim lined with a scratch on the table. I remember that detail because of what came next at 03:14, oxygen partial pressure dropped station-wide. The status board lit up like a Christmas tree. O₂ warnings in the galley, in the ROV bay, in the wet lab. Someone had cut the feed to the primary oxygen intake.

“Emergency tanks.” Samantha ordered, and Mason pulled them from stores with the speed of muscle memory. We opened the first in the galley, that sterile metallic tang filling our mouths as it released its oxygen. I stood in the corridor outside engineering while Samantha and Mason forced the hatch. Inside, the feed lines lay coiled. A panel was open. Wires were cut clean and arranged in twinned arcs on the floor. The neatness felt like a ritual.

Shane stood beside the panel with his hands at his sides.

“Why?” Samantha asked with fire in her voice.

Shane’s eyes were empty. “Because rescue crews need to come.” he said. “We need to be found.”

I stepped toward him before thinking. “How long have you felt this way?” I asked, and then caught myself and stepped back. He showed no emotion, nothing. “Since the vents.” he said.

“The vents?” Mason asked.

“The filtration vents.” Shane said, tone even. “I realized the pressure profile would mask our transmissions.”

“Mask how?” I demanded.

He tilted his head, as if listening to a distant radio. “The signature is low. They won’t hear us unless something is wrong.” He blinked. “We need to be found.”

We secured him. We zip-tied the wrists of a man who fixed our toilets at two in the morning and sang along to Jordan’s terrible playlists. We put him in Med One, and Holly stood by with a sedative she didn’t use yet. Samantha sent me to Comms to send a ping to the surface. “The sooner they send a reply, the sooner we have a decision.” she said.

“Decision?” I asked.

She looked at me for a long second. “How to quarantine.” She said.

I went to Comms. Steve was there, hands folded, headphones around his neck. “You good?” I asked. He nodded. “Can you send a ping?” I asked. He nodded again. “Can you tell me what day it is?” I asked, testing his orientation and he said, “Thursday” which was wrong.

“Take a break” I said. “Get some rest.”

He stood, took one step smoothly then paused, as if re-calibrating. He left though so I sat at his console and sent the uplink into a repeating message. There is an art to riding the column of water overhead like catching a gap in dense forest, aiming through where it is thinnest, letting the signal slip between the scattering leafs. I’ve always been fascinated with how it all works.

“Surface Command, this is Exo 9” I said when the channel finally answered. “We have a possible biohazard with behavioral effects. Request guidance and quarantine support.”

“Copy, Exo 9” a calm voice said. “Stand by.”

Stand by. Time felt as if the clocks stood still.

Samantha ordered a station-wide quarantine. Two-person rule. No one in engineering except Mason and Samantha. No one in the labs except me and Holly. No one in Comms except me and well, maybe just me for a bit.

I did what I do. I took samples from Iso Two in full protective kit. I took samples from the air filters, from the hand print, from the sink drain in the wet lab where Sarah rinsed glassware. Under the scope, I found filaments in the drain water. Too thin to see without dye, curling like hair in a breeze. They adhered to the dye and glided along the bottom of the sink toward the edge of the droplet. When the droplet evaporated, they curled into the residue and lay still until I breathed on the slide. At the first hint of condensation, they unfurled and moved again.

Heat slowed them. UV disorganized the cilia but did not tear the filaments. Bleach blistered them, but in the used bleach bath Aes Cyprium tips stayed intact like roots peeking from soil.

I tried something I am not proud of. I cut my palm, put a drop of my blood on a sterile plate beside the filament and watched. The filaments oriented toward it like sprouts toward light. I taped the plate to a small DC source creating a field from one end to the other. The filaments aligned faster. They didn’t need chemical gradients when electricity would do.

“I think it uses people as a conductor” I told Holly. I’d gone to Med Two to ask for sterile dressings. “Not for nutrients. For networking.”

Holly taped my palm without comment, her fingers deft. “I sedated Shane.” she said. “He kept standing up and walking to the door, then standing at the door. When I asked where he was going, he would say, to the nearest hub.”

“What hub?”

She didn’t answer. She was looking at my eyes. “Follow my finger.” she said. “Pupils slow but responsive.” she said, more to herself than me. “Any headaches?”

“Only coworkers.” I said and she almost smiled. Almost.

She handed me a sterile packet. “For your cut.” she said. “And for your conscience, if this thing is using motor memory, not cognition, then they aren’t choosing to do these things.”

“I know.” I said. “That part does not make it better.”

Lights flickered in patterns that resolved into messages on the engineering board. Someone had rerouted the maintenance logic controllers. Steve queued distress messages on the open channel, his voice pleading and flat “Please help. Oxygen sabotage. Please help.” on an endless loop. When I stopped the loop, he calmly started it again.

Jordan found needle-marks in her forearm she did not remember. “I don’t even like shots. I hate needles.” she said. Holly began inventorying every sharp, every sedative, every thing that could be a conduit. We locked the med stores. We locked the Med bays. We locked Iso Two. We used paper logs and pens that we tied to the tables like in school libraries.

I tested everyone’s reflexes, like a street magician proving there is nothing up their sleeve. Three of us showed a lag in pupillary response: Steve, Sarah, and Samantha. All three had been in Iso Two. All three lacked the small hesitations of uninfected human movement. The micro-corrections, the half-frowns, the laughter at a misstep. They moved as if gravity had been replaced with rails.

“Does it hurt?” I asked Sarah in a moment I could get her to sit and she considered the question “No.” she said finally. “It simplifies.”

“What does?”

“The graph” she said, and tapped her temple. “Noise becomes signal. There is a goal.”

“What goal?”

“We need to be found.” she said.

“You’ve been resisting it.” she said. “I can tell.” Her expression did not change.

“It is easier not to.” she said.

“Why is it easier?” I asked. If I understood the incentives, maybe I could interrupt them.

“It likes direction.” she said. “It likes edges. It likes pressure differentials, voltage gradients, open lines. It likes us because we are very complicated batteries and we are everywhere.”

“Does it know about the surface?” I asked.

She looked at the bulkhead, as if she could see through it despite 5 miles of black water above us. “It knows the idea of more.”

When she left, I cried into my hands for the first time since all of this had started. A flood emotions ran over me. I recorded the new vital stats and checked the O₂ levels and changed the CO₂ scrubbers because tears can coexist with responsibility and down here responsibility is the only proof you are not already eroding.

On the fourth day, the support ship answered fully. Not just “copy” and “stand by,” but a voice with a name and a team. “*Exo 9*, this is *Vex*. We have your telemetry and your message queue. We need your official hazard classification.”

“Level Four. Unknown agent, potential for airborne or contact transmission, confirmed behavioral effects. Unknown latency. No fatalities yet. High likelihood of station-wide compromise if not already.”

There was a pause. A human pause, the kind where someone looks at someone else and someone else nods. “Copy.” the voice said. “We are conferring with Command.”

“The infected aren’t violent. They are purposeful. They sabotage. They attempt to increase contact. They try to generate the appearance of disaster to compel a rescue.”

“Do they try to harm uninfected?”

“Not directly.” I said. “They set the stage for harm. They remove redundancy.”

“Do you have a containment plan?”

I looked at my hands, at the sterile dressing, at the tremble. “Not a plan that includes the surface.” I said.

“Copy.” the voice said, and the space between us filled with the ocean’s patient noise.

Shane, sedated but not fully asleep, sat up in Med Two and looked at Holly. “We need to be found.” he said. She sedated him again.

Steve restarted the distress loop twice in the time it took me to pee and wash my hands. Mike watched him and cried silently, tears falling in a line that darkened his shirt.

Jordan made us rice with canned mushrooms and set one bowl at each place without looking at names. “Eat.” she said. “We do better when we aren’t hungry.”

Then *Vex* returned to the line. “*Exo 9*, Command has considered the options.” the voice said. “Given the agent’s unknown properties, its apparent ability to alter behavior, and the risks associated with bringing any person or object to the surface, the decision is to scuttle. You are to prepare for controlled depressurization and destruction of the habitat. We will maintain station above for confirmation and retrieval of your comms buoy only.”

I knew it before they said it. Knowing didn’t change the particular quality of quiet that entered the room when the words arrived.

Samantha, who was soft and calm, responded. “Copy, *Vex*. This is Lead Samantha. I concur.”

“Samantha” I began.

She held up a hand and shook her head. “We lost containment the minute we pulled Aes Cyprium through the hatch.” She said, and it was the old her for a second, speaking loudly enough for all to hear. “All prepare.”

We established a timeline. We moved to the emergency procedural orders even as we broke with the whole point of procedures at this point. We cut the station into compartments in the system. We shut the airlock. We sealed Iso Two with more force than necessary and wrote DO NOT OPEN in black marker across the hatch even though the only people left to read were us. We reviewed the scuttle plan. Depressurize in stages to avoid uncontrolled implosion, then detonate the charges in the ballast and structural pins to tumble the station into the trench and bury it.

“We’ll need documentation for the comms buoy.” I said. “I’ll write the letter.” 

I failed to account for the last thing the infected would try.

They came to say goodbye.

Not with single sign of sadness or fear. In ones and twos, they stood at the Comms hatch and waited. They did not knock. They waited until I opened because despite everything I am polite. I opened to Jordan first.

She held a packet of crackers. “You forget to eat.” she said, voice even.

I took the crackers and wanted to slam the door but couldn’t. “Jordan.” I said, and my voice broke on her name. “Do you know what is happening?”

“We need to be found.” she said.

“Yes.” I whispered.

She tilted her head and for a moment a muscle under her eye twitched, as if the ocean inside her had a small storm. “Do it fast.” she said in her own voice, and then the flatness washed back. She turned and walked away as if she’d always trained for it.

Sarah came next. She was carrying my notebook. She handed it to me. Her fingers brushed mine and were warm. “The hand print on the glass is mine.” she said as if that mattered to her but it mattered to me because in a world of contagion, a confession is the last true ownership. “We need to be found.” she added. And then, at the threshold of the hallway, she turned back. “Tell my father I did not pick a fight with God,” she said and slowly walked away.

Steve came and stood and said nothing. I didn’t open for him. He stayed for twenty minutes and then left.

Mason came last, uninfected, eyes bloodshot from guarding engineering. “It’s time.” he said. “Samantha wants you on the call.”

I followed him to the central hub where the final panel waits behind glass like Death at our door. The crew was there. Some had placid eyes. Some trembled and clenched. Some, like me, oscillating between a scientist’s interest in what laid ahead or if God will accept me in heaven.

“Begin stage one.” Samantha said. Mason flipped the toggles. The pumps deepened in tone. The air thinned. My ears popped. We waited the prescribed thirty seconds then moved to stage two.

Between stage two and three, Sarah’s voice came through the intercom. “We need to be found.” she said and then softer: “Thank you for the Thursdays.” The intercom clicked off.

The infected made no move to stop us. That was the worst of it. They stood at stations, or in doorways, or in the galley where Jordan had left a bowl of uneaten rice, and they watched the numbers on the board flash. They looked like a congregation awaiting a sacrament. They weren’t praying. They were waiting to return to the trench.

Controlled depressurization on a deep station is a choreography of determination and patience. Too fast and you trigger cascading explosions; too slow and you run out of resolve. The trick, Shane once told me, is to set your pace to the station’s endurance, not your own.

We reached stage four. The frames creaked in low notes you feel deep in your chest. The lights dimmed and regained. Water outside the portholes looked not like water but like a crushing black void. Thick, mute, endless. I imagined Aes Cyprium outside in the silt, ribbons unfurled to feel the massive, flowing movement of the trench.

“Samantha.” I said, surprising myself with the sound of her name.

She looked at me. No smile. A leader to the end. “Yes, Doctor?”

“Before this.” I said. “Before any of this. Why did you take the assignment? No noble reasons. I need the selfish ones.”

She considered “Because of the money.” She said. “Because every surface job ends in a meeting where nothing happened and everyone pretends it did.” She nodded once. “Stage five.”

We engaged it together as if the two of us could carry what we had to do like a stretcher. The station groaned. A plate in the galley popped free and clanged to the floor, a single comic effect in a tragedy that did not want it.

The intercom clicked. Jordan’s voice, dull as ever: “Eat.” she said to nobody. Then silence.

The final stage is a plunge, not a step. We had wired it that way. The logic is brutal and sound. If you must kill a dream that wants to grow, you kill it quickly.

“Ready?” Samantha said.

“Ready.” Mason echoed.

I put my hand on the panel. My palm throbbed with the memory of the cut. I imagined *Aes Cyprium* in me, if it was in me, orienting, aligning, eager for the nearest pulse. I imagined, for an instant, that the nearest hub was not Comms or the oxygen manifold but the open world above us. Ships, phones and airplanes. Hearts beating infected with Aes Cyprium. I whispered to myself “We do not need to be found.”

“Now.” Samantha said.

Mason threw the switch.

You know the physics; you’ll get the telemetry. You’ll model it and file it and, if we’re very lucky, you’ll create a training sim so some kid ten years from now learns a thing that feels like a ghost story and keeps them safer than we were.

For me, the sensations are all I can tell you. The walls bending lower, the floor rising with a flex like a breath held too long, the lights squeezing to points, the brief exquisite silence as the pumps stop and the station becomes a bell at the bottom of the ocean. The way people breathe when they know there are no more steps between them and the thing that will end them.

We had minutes. We had less. I ran to Comms because I wanted my last act to be writing this. Steve had left the door open. He sat in the chair and looked at the speaker as if it were the rising sun on a beach. “Please help.” he said, with absolutely no urgency.

I put a hand on his shoulder. “We did.” I said.

He blinked while turning to look at me. The eyes are a strange window in a person. I saw nothing in them and everything. He stood and walked out.

I started typing.

One last thing, because you will ask, and because it matters. What is Aes Cyprium?

It is organic with cellular modules that self-assemble into conduction channels. It establishes connections and then inhabits them like vines on trellises. It is not sentient in any way we recognize and yet it pursues a global reproduction the way all life does, find more places to run its current. It does not feed on us. It does not crave us. It uses us the way lightning uses metal rods.

Could it have been contained? Maybe. If we had recognized the hand print on the glass the moment it happened. If we had scuttled Iso Two at the first sign. But we are scientists and we love the thing in front of us more than we fear the thing it could be and that is how we go extinct, or how we go to the stars. This time it was not stars.

Will it reach the surface now? Not from us. But the trench is old and long and I would bet a year’s salary that Aes Cyprium has done this dance before.

If you search the deep do it with glass that no one can touch and with suits that repel Aes Cyprium. With an acceptance letter to humility in your pocket.

The pumps are singing higher now, which means they are straining, we are close. I can feel the air get thin at the back of the throat. The algae by my shoulder looks almost gold in this light. I’m hungry. Jordan would scold me. She would hand me a cookie and pour tea and tell me the story about the storm when she was 12. When the trees on her street were tore up by the roots from a passing tornado. I will hold that picture for a moment. It feels like an honest way for a thing to fall.

I wish I could say we fought. A story likes to end with blood and heroics. What we did was better, I think. We chose. We chose the world above our own lives. Don’t be angry at us for not having more artful endings.

To anyone who studies what we love, there is beauty in the deep and it is not ours to bring home.

My name is Dr. Lennox Miller. The time is, my watch says 02:14 AM but I don’t know if that is correct anymore.

We do not need to be found.

Can't drink tea which is considered healthy but can drink energy drinks which is unhealthy 

The Word of wisdom is supposed to keep us healthy, but who's more healthy, a 400 pound man who eats fast food everyday and doesn't drink tea or coffee. Or a super fit and healthy person BUT they drink tea. The person that's following the WoW is fat and unhealthy but the other person is fit and drinks tea. God probably doesn't see weight and sees that one followed the WoW and one didn't so he sees the fat guy as someone who follows him. But the whole point of the WoW is to stay healthy, so who's really the one who's following the WoW

we are taught that we will become Gods (dnc 132 15-20) but in the bible it doesn't teach that, it says that there are no other God other then God himself (Isaiah 45:5, 43:10)                                            

Also in Abraham 4:1, it says Gods organized the heavens and earth. but only God did. this also contradicts Isaiah 45:5

We believe that we can be married for eternity and stay with your partner, but in Matthew 22:30 it says in the resurrection we don't marry or are given marriage 

we say that we are saved by grace, but to get to the celestial kingdom its kinda a lot of good works, which isn't grace

1pgss97,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pgss97/they_always_think_theyre_smarter_mr_7days_part_1/,They Always Think They're Smarter: Mr. 7-days (Part 1 of),"I’ve been the best since I started and I’ll be the best when I quit because every other genius I work with, some most assuredly smarter than me, lack a skill that would entitle them to the role of the best: Observation. They miss things, things I can’t help but plunk hairs out over them missing, and then ogle me like I’m Christ when I point them out. I see things everyone else misses, things that are always there no matter how elegant the crime because no crime is perfect. 

Hundreds of men- and women respectively- tried their damnedest to prove me wrong but none have even neared such a feat. Last year, some sociopathic brit gave an admirable effort. The Gingerbread Man. Run, run, run… “You can’t catch me.” but the cookie- crumpet- left crumbs. A month, over the course of a 7 day week, another tried their hand at the perfect crime: And played the best hand yet.

I stumbled out of bed around the witching hour to antagonize the spirits and demons with a cup of coffee and a plate of 4 eggs and 2 pieces of toast. I first ate this meal; 4 eggs, coffee, 2 pieces of toast; when I was 15 at 3:36 in the morning at a diner during a family road trip, and have eaten it every day at 3:36 in the morning since. I was born and lived in Wales for the first 3 years of my life, but moved to Georgia 3 days after my 3rd birthday. This meant that until roundabout the age of 20, I had an atrocious mutated accent that blended Welsh and Georgia Southern. I ordered eggs and a piece of roast at the diner, but the waitress misunderstood me and served me the much superior breakfast instead. Eggs, coffee, toast.

After eating, I washed my dishes and sat on the couch to watch my daily morning 4 episodes of Golden Girls- I once smashed the family TV when I was 8 because the DVR only recorded 3- when my phone rang. I refused to answer it. The episode's credits were rolling but the outro song hadn’t ended yet. It rang again and died off. It rang once more but this time I picked it up as the screen went black. 

“Hello?”

“Charlie?”

“Yes.” I said blankly as I fiddled with a strand of hair.

“We’ve picked up a case: Oats Valley, Rhode Island. Get to the tarmac, we’re flying out at 6.” Zadok’s charming voice cooed over the phone.

“On my way.” I hurried to my closet and unracked and packed my 7 sets of my outfit- white button up, black tie, white T-shirt, cargo pants, and my green chucks- into my duffel bag. Despite my routine being “Algorithmic,” as it's been called, I put the bare minimum into my effort when getting dressed; I rarely bother tying my shoes, but I button my shirt and- loosely- tie my tie each time.

My bike revved and as the engine warmed I stuffed the duffel bag into the saddlebag. My house is small, my clothes are bought in bulk, but my bike was where I spent big. My Confederate FA-13-  engraved along the side read: In love, my father- was admittedly a big spend, but I don’t spend money often. My house was given to me by work, my food; besides breakfast; was paid for by work, and my uniform; beside my shoes; were once more paid for by work. 145 horsepower carried me wistfully to the Organization's private runway. 

\*\*\*

“What’s he waiting for?” A snub-nosed, Shar Pei man guffed.

“It’s 5:58. We told him we’re leaving at 6, so… he’s waiting for 6.” 

“He does this often?”

“Every time, about 9 years ago we were tired of making late flights so we just told him to get here 15 minutes before we actually took off.”

“Seems like a burden.” 

“He’s a slave to routine- besides: Man’s a brainiac.” Zadok always dressed with enthusiastic pomp. He believes a genius detective should wear an equally genius suit. While I disagree with the principle, I can’t deny a good suit when I see it. This one was dim maroon and his personal favorite in size and breast.

“Who’s this?” I asked as I stepped through the men on to the plane and seated my bag.

“Oats Valley, Rhode Island Sheriff, Isaiah Bradford.” My nose bristled against the stink of habitually conjured smoke, soaked into the man’s existence. His left leg bowed faintly and that side’s foot was flippant and untamed.

“Your inserts are too big.” I thought aloud; grabbing a donut from the box of 12. “Give me your lighter.”

“I don’t- what?”

“Lighter.”

“Why? And wait, how dare yo-”

“Give me the lighter.” He turned to Zadok who ignored his gaze, alerting the pilots to raise the stairs. Baffled to silence, he scoffed and passed me his lighter. Moonlight infested the plane's cavity as I awoke each half-lidded window of the plane. 

I bit into my donut, resting my head onto my bag, and slid gently into my headphones. The plane; harboring a humming Bowie fan, a sheriff of a town in a state I had no care to respect, and well-suited reader, jaunted into the air with infractionless obedience of Bernoulli's.

Across the pitch, a laminated box was fussed with followed by the stiff rifling of pockets crescendoing into a defeated sigh and the replacement of the box into a pocket. I weakly itched my nose and drifted off to sleep.

May it be intuition, or surgical routine but an hour before landing I sat up awake. “Why did you contact us?”

“No good morning? No who’d ya sleep?” The withdrawn Sheriff asked.

“No sir, I believe he asked you why you called us?” Zadok answered, saving me from having to repeat myself.

After much pause: “It wasn’t my idea. One of my deputies told me about an organization, some fancy thing where genius PI’s take cases deemed impossible. He told me it’s strictly lock and key, only police stations and departments have access to your contact. He told me to call you, because the serial killer Mr. 7-Days is due to start his annual killing spree.”

“Dumb name- Annual?” I asked as I cleaned my glasses.

“Every year- from February 11th to the 17th- he kills someone each day: Sunday by fire. Monday by water, Tuesday by- usually- a gun, Wednesday by asphyxia, Thursday by poison, Friday by stabbing with shards of a mirror, and Saturday by Scythe. Every year, for the past 3 years. That guy leaves no trace, no gloats or notes, just the bodies.”

“He leaves a trace, you just don’t see it. His vehicles for homicide are quite specific. Any significance to you?” I asked.

“No.”

“I assumed.” I turned to Zadok and with a look he pointed to the French press.

“So why fly out and not just settle with calling us?” The press jeered below my palm.

“Frankly speaking: The less time I spend as a possible victim the better.”

“So you swore to serve and protect but are a coward as well?” I asked without the slightest trace of intended disrespect, it was a genuine question.

“Listen kid, I’m old enough to be your father, and you’re damned lucky I ain’t ‘cause with that mouth I'd be liable to slap you silly.”

“Everyone just relax, okay?”

“Put a leash on him. Don’t care how damn smart he is, I won't take disrespect.”

“He didn’t answer my question.” I grumbled but had the awareness to do so under my breath so he wouldn’t hear.

The vessel came to an enthusiastic stop, letting open its jowls to make way for us to disembark. A seldom-spaced can taxied us from the landing strip to the Oats Valley Police Station. The carbon slate box coward from study breezes, stiffly between two other stubby buildings. I exited first from the car but lagged behind to let Isaiah touch the door and open it. Greeting me inside were 3 desks and 2 deputies. “That big is Hunter, and the other is Axel.”

“Nice to meet you, gentlemen. My name is Zadok, Zay if it’s more comfortable, and that: Is Agent Charlie Gnosis.” Zadok shook their hands for me as I took in the breath of the room, a third of which housed Deputy Hunter. Axel was a junior by a factor of 3 from the Sheriff and was as fiddly and anxious as comes with youth, most assuredly exacerbated by his strenuous employment, and looked at me with some awe.

Zadok began his usual procedure of befriendment as I stalked around the office working harder than I should have to to avoid tripping on the spilt Hunter. In a small nook on Axel’s side was a miniature library of encyclopedias of rubber varieties, Norse myth, and legal jargon, as well as the sparse fiction. The bulk of the fiction texts were stored on the bottom shelf labeled in ownership to Sheriff Isaiah, above was an almost empty shelf aside from cobwebs and two cook books deeded to Hunter, Axel’s shelf was where the real books were stored and reading the titles tempted me to remove my library card from my wallet and ask what the checkout limit is. “We will need all files and related media to Mr. 7-Days and the victims, and a recommendation for the cleanest hotel in this town.”

“That’d be the Marrion out by the ports, they got the fancy beds.” Axel lisped.

“Marriot?” 

“Marrion, legally distinct.”

Zadok hurled me a look, but I replied with a shivering nod of acceptance. “Perfect. Gentlemen, it's been lovely meeting you, a real pleasure.” He shook their hands twice each, “But I’m afraid we’ve had a long flight and are as exhausted as they make ‘em.” Isaiah nodded in agreement as he sanded his weary eyes. 

“We’ll be back in the morning. I expect everyone to be well rested and sober.” Everyone laughed; Zadok laughed in community not humor with the laughter around him, knowing I hadn’t intended for what I said to be funny.

\*\*\*

“None of this makes sense.” Zadok sounded from the small corner desk as I clogged the room with the stench of artificial lemon. “7 days, 7 deaths, 7 completely unrelated devices of homicide. Once a week? Every year for the past 3? And not a trace to be gleaned.""

“All related.” I corrected.

“What?” He turned in his chair as I flicked off the bathroom light and tracked me as I disrobed my hands of the vinyl gloves and reclothed them with another pair that would serve as more permanent attire now that the space was clean enough. A small tide of vomit tickled the back of my throat as I touched the damp box of the gloves- moistened by disinfectant- but pushed through as I usually do to retrieve my protectors.

“Each method is the exact same each year, even the beach the people are drowned on and the rope used to bind them is the same.”

“And that relates them how?”

“Reason for yourself: You are a crippling narcissist who had planned- because this is most surely planned- a string of prefect murders from the 11th to 17th of February. You commit 7 perfect crimes in a row and get off, never so much as suspected.”

“Okay…?”

“You kill these people for a reason, a reason you find very intelligent and spectacular but none of the dim wits in this town actually get why you did what you did. They call you a crazed mass murder and give you no merits for your genius murders. Read those transcripts; they never even mention that you left no trace. They don’t boast of how perfect your crimes were- on top of not understanding why you did what you did in the first place.”

“So you do it again.”

“Exactly.”

“Some one doesn’t get a joke so you say it again but louder.”

“Exactly. He’s not killing again because he wants to, but because he has to: He has to have people relish his genius.”

“He needs praise…” Zadok bubbled. “Dim-wits?” He questioned. “They’re not that bad. We’ve most certainly seen worse.”

“Why do you think he chose February?""

“Shortest month of the year?”

“Don’t give me the moronic answer, give me the dim answer.”

“Roman festival celebrating rebirth. Februa which is what February is named after.”

“Much better.” I tossed open my duffel bag and removed my sleeping bag, proceeding to begin disinfecting it.

“Right, but that’s not the dim answer; that’s the: I accidentally took too many etymology classes in college answer.” 

I turned sharply to Zadok and gestured at him with my sloshing spray bottle. “It was no accident.” He chuckled and turned back to the files.

“Either way; still doesn’t explain how these 7 days are related.”

“It's simple: in… in- uh… do you smell that?” Zadok’s nose twitched to attempt to capture the odor I was tracing.

“No-” I muted him with a gloved hand over his mouth. 

“Ozone.” I tapped my extended index finger to my lips and pulled my service weapon off my hip. Zadok left the chair with silent grace, pulling his revolver off the nightstand. I removed my phone and aimed the camera down the peephole. I pressed my body against the wall and leaned to examine the camera’s view; Zadok reached the corner of the hall leading into the room and stored a breath. 

My ear established contact with my shoulder and in the window of the camera stood an opaque silhouette. \*Pop\* \*Pop\* \*Pop\* Three stapler shots clicked off and an accompanying three messy holes appeared, flying into where my gut would have stood. The phone squealed as it clattered to the ground, whining more when the door stuck its eyes and hurled into the wall that was soon dented by the door handle. I flew into the hall and cracked off 8 .45 ACP down the hall, only stopping when the slide of the 1911 locked back- hungry for more rounds. The figure scrambled down the hall wheezing and giggling after feeling a bullet fly through his hoodie and draw a line along their scalp, barely off enough to not break skin.

“Fuck!” The maw of Zadok’s revolver leveled down the hall but remained meek as the figure dashed into the stairwell.

“Run him down-” Zadok was half-way down the hall. I slid back into the room, dragged my palms through the residual disinfectant on the sleeping bag, and threw open the window to the fire escape; stumbling on 3 small black spheres tossed around the carpet in the process. I scaled a level down, aimed, and landed shoulder first into the roof of the only car I didn’t recognize from my last look out the room window. I hacked and sniffed as I rolled off to the side walk and reset my shoulder against the door of the Honda. Zadok barked from around the side of Marrion’s and from the alley, the figure ran out into my shoulder.

The figure rammed his elbow into my ribs, working his right arm out of my grip and emptying his magazine down the alley; a bullet glanced across Zadok’s cheek, beating the odds of hitting him as he tossed himself behind a dumpster. My gloved hand shot out and fiddled against his throat trying to find the top of the sternum; I divined it and drove my thumb into his windpipe.

The figure balked like a tormented chicken and flailed against me harder, colliding his forehead against my nose. My nostrils flared and the bones cackled then gurgled through the blood. The figure gave a final thrash and escaped my grip, into their car, blazing off down the street, and rounding the corner before Zadok got to my side.

“Shit! Shit!” He shouted, tucking his arms under me and waddling with me over the back seat of the rental. I wept inaudible cries of disgust.

“Ethss airrrr-” I gagged on my blood and disgust. The bullet I fired ripped open the man’s balaklava, making way for his sweat soaked hairs to rub against my face. I stiffed my cries as much as I could muster, trying to not inflame Zadok’s already exorbitant stress with annoyance with my babyish behavior. The hybrid engine of the Prius roared- purred- and the tires yelped.

I wiggled forward, struggling against agony to wash my face in my blood in the vain hope the sparse white blood cells would exterminate any bacteria. My placid limp face was surreally red when, finally, the car rocked to a screaming stop.

“Well, Mr. Smith, he’ll be able to breathe, but he won’t be able to take another tumble like that. This splint needs to set for a couple of weeks minimum.” Zadok stood beside me as the doctor impressed upon me how fragile the 13 fragments my nose had been factored to, currently were.

“Thank you, doctor.” Zadok shook the prim doctor’s hand.

“Never thought private nursing was so dangerous.” The doctor joked.

“Hauling around 50 pound oxygen tanks isn’t necessarily safe, I’ve had my fair share of spills.” Zadok’s ruckus laugh clattered about the room in a skipping dance.

After some more banter, the doctor took leave to input a Mr. James’s- my- files into the hospital's system. “Nurses?”

“I had to think of something.”

“I’m not complaining, it’s just a new one; usually it’s: Boxer and his coach, or home renovators.” 

“Gotta be open to new things, bud.” He smirked and I smiled back, shifting my head slightly only for it to flare with aching pain. Zadok flinched at my stifled pain. “How bad is it?”

“Remember, Mr. Cruel?”

“Yeah.”

“About there.”

“Fucking hell… At least neither of us got shot.” He shrugged.

“I’d prefer that.” Zadok laughed again but stopped as he met my slitted eyes. “Rubber bullets; had enough power to go through the door but they bounced off the window, almost tripped on one on my way out.”

“He was trying to scare us off?”

“No, far as he sees it, we’re the only people who can understand his motive. He was goading us.” Zadok chewed methodically on his lip. “And…” I gave the clock a moment more to finish counting. “Now it’s the 11th.”

First off, I wonder if there’s an app where we can both write out our daily to do list, and as we check it off throughout the day the other can see? Knowing someone can see the minute things I’m missing would have me ON IT.

I am the kind of person that needs to be busy 24/7, from when I wake up to when I sleep. It makes me feel best. I did this for a year and it was truly the happiest I’ve ever been, while also keeping me sober. I don’t do drugs, but alcohol derailed me more than I will express in this post, sober friends welcome!

I’m working on/wanting to work on the following, with the earlier mentioned things being higher on the priority list but not necessarily in this order:

Enroll in two non-college classes, start studying for CLEP courses/officially transfer schools, study for CompTIA courses, return to studying Spanish + Mandarin, work out, regularly meal prep, learn sewing + makeup + coffee, learn some C# (for work), go out and meet people more, make friends, etc…

Obviously I need to prioritize some, but there’s a lot I want to do. Bonus points if you’re in central Houston too (but not a creep)

Please don’t message if you’re eventually going to be weird. Also, I want to be ON each others ass and figure out a way where we both have no other option to be accountable.",1,1765139428.0,GetMotivatedBuddies,0,1.0,False

Continued from Part 1A

When they arrived home, Al reached for the letter and packet on the dashboard. As he opened the door and stepped out halfway, he paused. Turning back to Charlie, his eyes softened, carrying a sincerity she hadn’t seen in years.

“I was thinking on the drive back,” he began, his voice steady but weighted with emotion. “I don’t ever want you to miss hearing these words from me: I love you. I’ve always been proud of you. And I’m sorry I haven’t been a better father to you.”

She froze, the weight of his words settling over her like a heavy blanket. Her lips parted, but no sound came out. She searched his face, looking for any sign of insincerity, but found none.

“I... I don’t know what to say,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. She wanted to believe him, wanted to cling to the warmth his words carried, but doubt lingered like a shadow, refusing to let go.

Her eyes dropped to her hands, twisting nervously in her lap. “You mean that? You’re not just saying it because... because of all this?”

Her voice wavered, betraying the fragile hope she was trying to hide.

He chuckled softly—a sound so rare it startled her. Reaching over, he tousled her hair, then smoothed it back with a tenderness she hadn’t felt in years. A broad smile broke across his face, one she could barely remember seeing.

“Chuck,” he said, his voice carrying the affectionate nickname that meant he was in a rare, good mood. “I’ve felt that way since the day you were born,” he continued, his tone steady but laden with emotion. “I’ve always wanted to be the best father I could be for you. But I’ve made (sigh)… a lot of mistakes. Mistakes I hate myself for. So, no. I’m not just saying it because of all this. It’s a dad thing. Always has been.”

Her lower lip trembled a little, and her eyes glistened as she looked up at him. For a moment, she didn’t say anything—just stared, as though trying to etch this moment into her memory forever. When she finally spoke, her voice was thick with emotion.

“I... I’ve always known you loved me, even when things were hard, even when you didn’t say it. But hearing it now... It means everything, Dad.” Her hand hesitated, then reached out to grab his arm, holding on tight. “You’re not perfect, but you’re my dad. And that’s all I’ve ever needed you to be.”

She swallowed hard, a tear slipping down her cheek, though she quickly wiped it away with her sleeve. “Thank you... for trying... for still being here for me. For not giving up.”

Her words were small, but they carried the weight of a lifetime of emotions—unspoken gratitude and a fragile glimmer of hope. Healing overdue, but maybe not impossible.

 

\*\*\*

 

Inside, Al moved to the dining room table and carefully poured the packet’s contents onto the surface. Papers spilled out—legal documents, property deeds, and a few personal letters. He gave her a cautious glance.

“Alright,” he said gently. “You can sit here with me, but let me go through this first. If there’s anything bad, I want it to hit me before you so I can soften the blow.”

“Okay, Dad,” she said quietly, sitting down at the edge of the table. Despite her nervousness, a flicker of hope warmed her chest—maybe there were answers here, something to explain her mother’s disappearance.

He sifted through the documents methodically, his face shifting between confusion and focus. Most of it seemed mundane, legal jargon hinting at the life Beverly had left behind. But then his hand froze mid-motion.

A single envelope, slightly heavier than the rest, slipped into his palm. Its weight felt wrong, unsettling. With trembling fingers, he opened it and pulled out its contents.

His face dropped like a stone, and a heavy silence filled the room.

“Dad?” Charlie’s voice wavered, the creeping sense of dread intensifying.

Before he could respond, something surged within her—a sudden, sharp heat flared on her left shoulder. It struck like a bolt of lightning, an excruciating flash that seared through her body as if something was branding her very soul.

She screamed, the sound raw and primal. The pain vanished almost as quickly as it came, but its echo lingered in her mind—a phantom sensation that left her trembling.

Her hands flew to her shoulder, and her breathing came in shallow gasps. “No, no, no,” she muttered, her voice quaking. “Dad—what’s happening?”

Al dropped everything and leaped to her side, pulling her into his arms as her panic spiraled. “Charlie! Talk to me—what’s wrong?!” His voice cracked, desperate to understand.

She couldn’t answer. Tears streamed down her face as the reality set in. She clawed at the sleeve of her shirt, yanking it down to expose her shoulder. The mark—the Eclipse Mark—gleamed faintly, its dark center surrounded by a thin, flickering ring of dim light.

Her sobs turned into hysterical cries. “No! No! I don’t want this! Why is this happening to me?”

He tightened his grip around her, his own fear buried beneath a fragile mask of determination. “It’s okay, baby. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere. We’ll figure this out, I promise.”

But his eyes betrayed him, drawn back to the envelope still sitting on the table. The contents spilled across the surface, and his stomach churned at the sight—a jagged piece of human skin, its torn edges curling slightly. It lay atop a folded letter, mocking him with its grotesque stillness.

That mark—the same one now burned into Charlie’s shoulder—stared back at him like an accusation he couldn’t ignore. Beverly’s disappearance began to form a picture he wasn’t ready to see.

This wasn’t just a random twist of fate.

This was a calculated choice.

 

**May 3rd, 2022 – 3:17 PM**

Al was heading up to the guest room when the realization struck—it wasn’t just a guest room anymore. It was her room now. Beverly’s leaving had made that clear. There was no denying it anymore.

The memory of yesterday clawed at him. He’d tried to console Charlie when the mark appeared, but her reaction had been as fiery as it was devastating. She had flown into hysterics, her words cutting into him like shards of glass.

“This is your fault!” she had screamed, her voice raw and venomous. “You knew this could happen! You let this happen!”

Her accusations were relentless, each one laced with a pain so sharp it felt like a physical blow. In the chaos, only his favorite coffee cup had shattered—but her words… her words had broken far more.

Overwhelmed and desperate for some semblance of safety, she had run to the guest room and locked herself inside. For hours, Al had stood on the other side of that door, helpless. At first, he’d heard her sobs—muffled and raw. Then came the silence. It was an eerie, oppressive quiet that pressed against him like a vice.

Now, standing outside that same door, the weight of everything crushed him. Guilt gnawed at him relentlessly, tearing at the edges of his composure. This was the moment he had feared for so long. He’d tried to prepare for it, to brace himself, but no amount of mental armor could shield him from this. Knowing it might come was one thing. Living it was something else entirely.

When Charlie had first come to him with Beverly’s disappearance, he’d convinced himself that Beverly’s actions would eventually lead her to become one of the Gloomcrawlers. But this… this was darker. The contents of that envelope had made it undeniable. This wasn’t coincidence. Beverly had made a deal with the Matron.

He had read Beverly’s letter over and over, the truth scrawled in her familiar hand as damning as any sentence. She had sacrificed their daughter. To save herself, Beverly had traded their child’s future for her own freedom.

He wanted to rage at the unfairness, to punch a hole in the wall, to do something—anything—to push back against the storm of disgust and despair roiling in his chest. But it wouldn’t change the facts.

Beverly, the woman he had once loved so deeply, had bartered their daughter’s life.

Knocking lightly on the door, he let out a shaky breath, his hands trembling at his sides. His heart ached at the thought of Charlie suffering alone on the other side. He wanted to comfort her, to take her pain away, but he didn’t know how.

“Hey…” he began softly, his voice faltering. “I’m not sure how to do this, so I’m just gonna… try. I know I haven’t been the dad you needed, but I’m trying now. I’m gonna stand here and be…”

Before he could finish, the door burst open, and Charlie ran straight into his arms, colliding with him in a desperate need to feel safe. She clung to him as if he were the only solid thing left in her crumbling world, her sobs raw and unrelenting.

“Why me?! Why me, Dad?!” she cried over and over, her words fractured by gasps for air.

He didn’t speak. He couldn’t. He just held her tightly, his own heart shattering with every tear she shed. There were no words to make this better, no comfort to erase the pain she was feeling.

He waited, letting the storm pass. The sobs gradually slowed, her breath hitching as she struggled to regain control. Silence settled over them, heavy but grounding. Al gave her the space to gather herself, knowing what he needed to say next would break her all over again.

 

\*\*\*

 

Eventually, they moved to the living room. Charlie perched on the edge of the couch, her posture tense, braced for impact. Al sat beside her, one arm resting along the back of the couch, the other holding a box of tissues she hadn’t yet touched. Her eyes glistened with fresh tears that refused to fall, hanging on by sheer force of will.

His thoughts raced, but no words seemed adequate. How do you tell a child that the person she trusted most, the one who was supposed to protect her, had bartered her future away?

He rubbed her back in slow, steady circles, trying to soothe her trembling shoulders. His voice cracked as he spoke her name. “Charlie…”

He cleared his throat, forcing himself to meet her gaze. “I know why you got the mark.”

Her head snapped toward him, her eyes wide with disbelief and a desperate, fragile hope. “You do?” Her voice was small, barely more than a whisper, as though she were afraid to hope.

He nodded, the weight of her gaze pressing heavily against his chest.

*Bev… if I ever see you again…*

The thought burned in his mind, but he shoved it aside. Charlie needed him now, and there was no room for anger—not yet.

“Sweetie...” He took a shaky breath, his hand stilling on her back. “I don’t even know where to begin. There’s no easy way to say this, but I have to. You deserve to know the truth.”

A single tear slipped down her cheek, carving a silent path across her face. She brushed it away absently, her voice trembling but resolute. “Tell me,” she whispered.

Her words hung in the air like a challenge he wasn’t sure he could meet. But he had to. For her.

Al exhaled, glancing at her. “I think you need to understand your mom definitely knew this was going to happen.”

“How?” Charlie asked, tilting her head.

“That note… the one with the ‘useless map.’ She underlined ‘marked’ as her first clue. However, you need to see everything in the packet.”

Charlie’s mind spun. Her mother had tried to tell them she was going to be marked—but how would she have known?

He looked at her and braced himself for what he knew would be the most devastating thing he would ever have to say. “I brought everything with me to show you, and I need you to understand—this is going to be hard. Maybe the hardest thing you’ll ever hear. But before I do, I need you to know something.”

His voice gentle, steady but trembling with emotion. “I will never abandon you. Never. I swear on my life, Charlie, I will die to protect you. That’s my promise. That dad thing again.”

He tried to comfort her, clinging to the hope that it might soften the blow. But deep down, he knew it wouldn’t. Nothing could.

She nodded faintly, her gaze dropping to her hands. “Thank you, Dad…” Her voice was quiet, almost childlike.

Her words hit him like a punch to the gut, making what he had to do next even harder. He couldn’t shield her from this. He didn’t have that power.

“So…” He swallowed hard, forcing himself to continue. “The envelope here has a couple of things in it. I need you to stay as calm as you can, but I know this is going to be bad. Worse than you’re ready for. Please, believe me when I say I wish it wasn’t. And Charlie…” His voice dropped lower, thick with emotion. “I love you. Never doubt that. Okay?”

“Okay…” she whispered, her voice trembling.

With unsteady hands, Al reached into the envelope and pulled out the first item: a jagged piece of skin. Marked with the familiar Eclipse symbol, its torn edges curled slightly, as if recoiling from what it had been forced to endure. He placed it carefully on the table between them.

Charlie recoiled, her breath catching as her eyes locked onto the grotesque object. “Is that… what I think it is?” Her voice wavered, disbelief and revulsion twisting together, raw and unfiltered.

Al let out a heavy sigh, running his hands over his face as though trying to will away the moment. “Yeah…” His voice was quiet, pained. “And this… this is just the beginning of the whole damn mess.”

She flinched at his words. Her father rarely swore, and when he did, it meant something was deeply, horribly wrong. But even then, she wasn’t ready for what came next.

He pointed to the skin, his voice tightening. “That? It’s your mother’s.”

The words hit her like a lightning strike. Her breath held, and she almost fell back as though the truth itself had shoved her.

Her voice broke, rising into a scream as fresh tears poured down her cheeks. “MOM?! SHE’S DEAD?!”

“No, no!” Al said quickly, his own voice cracking under the weight of it all. “She’s not dead.” He hesitated, his face contorted with disgust. “Not yet, at least.”

She stared at him, her body trembling, her breath coming in shallow gasps. Al took a deep breath to steady himself, but his words carried the crushing weight of what he was about to reveal.

“This… this was part of the price she paid to leave. Her ‘pound of flesh,’ so to speak. She made a deal with the Matron to get out of Everfall.”

Charlie’s mind reeled, struggling to grasp the enormity of what she’d just heard. “Leave Everfall?” she repeated, her voice sharp and edged with disbelief. “Can’t you just drive away?”

Al gave her a grim, bitter smile, the lines around his mouth tightening with frustration and years of failed attempts. “Sure, you can drive away,” he said, his tone cutting. “You might even make it a few states over. But within a day or two, you’ll wake up right back here, as if you never left. Every single time I’ve tried, I’ve ended up back in my bed like nothing happened.”

Her eyes widened, her breath catching in her throat. “You’ve been stuck here all this time? Ever since you got the mark?”

“Yep.” His response was flat, drained of emotion, as if the weight of it had long since crushed him. The resignation in his voice was like a hollow echo. But then his expression shifted, darkening into something stormy and raw. A flicker of anger reignited in his eyes.

“But back to your mother…”

Charlie clung to the words as if they were a rope, trying to pull meaning out of them even as her mind pushed back. “So, she made a deal with the Matron to get away and… had her mark cut off?” The question scraped past her lips. “That’s why you’re angry?”

“That was part of it,” he said quietly, every syllable taut with controlled fury. “But there’s more—something I can’t forgive.” His jaw tightened; a hard line ran down his neck. “There’s a reason she underlined ‘marked’ on the note she left you.”

He let the pause sit between them, then met her eyes, the edges of his face softening a fraction. “I’ll let you read it. But you have to be ready. I’ll be right here the whole time. If you need to hold on to me, I won’t let go. Understand?”

Charlie hesitated, her hands trembling as she reached for the letter. She nodded faintly, unable to speak, her heart hammering in her chest.

The paper felt heavy in her hands, as though it carried the weight of every unanswered question, every shred of doubt that had haunted her since her mother disappeared. With a deep, trembling breath, she unfolded it.

As her eyes scanned the words, her world crumbled.

The realization hit her like an avalanche, burying her under a mountain of unbearable truth. Each word clawed at her, ripping away what little stability she had left. Her mother’s familiar handwriting, once a source of comfort, now felt like a blade carving through her chest.

Her breathing turned to shallow gasps, her vision blurring as tears spilled unchecked down her face. Her hands shook, the letter quivering in her grip as though it might shatter under the weight of its contents.

The words were merciless, impossible to refute. The truth burned into her mind with excruciating clarity: her mother, the one person she had trusted above all else, had betrayed her. Beverly had sacrificed her own daughter, handing her over to the Matron to take her place.

Charlie stared at the letter, her body frozen, her mind spiraling into a chasm of disbelief and pain. She couldn’t look away, couldn’t stop the torrent of emotions crashing over her—shock, grief, betrayal. They threatened to drown her.

Her mother had chosen her own freedom over Charlie’s life.

The letter slipped from her hands, fluttering to the floor. Her lips moved soundlessly, trying to form words, but none came. She felt hollow, gutted, as if the betrayal had carved out a part of her she’d never get back.

She sat motionless, staring into nothing, as the full weight of her mother’s choice crashed over her like a crushing tide.

Al’s voice blurred into the background, his light shaking registering only as faint tremors against her dazed expression.

**May 7th, 2022 - 7:13 AM**

Dawn had broken, the early light spilling through the windows, but Al had been up for hours. Sleep eluded him, his mind gnawed by relentless worry.

Charlie had unearthed an old notebook from her room, buried beneath a pile of forgotten clothes in the closet. At first, it had seemed like a harmless distraction, a way to pass the time. But it had quickly morphed into something darker—an obsession. She poured herself into it with a manic energy that teetered on the edge of desperation.

She barely left her room anymore. The notebook consumed her. Its pages filled rapidly with scrawled words and jagged sketches, each darker and more frantic than the last. Whenever Al tried to check on her, her responses were clipped, distracted—her focus locked on the notebook, as if it were the only thing tethering her to reality.

The drawings unnerved him—twisted figures, shadowy shapes, and endless renditions of the Eclipse Mark, sketched with a near-ritualistic intensity. The writing was worse. It was raw, angry, and dripping with pain—accusations, fragmented thoughts, and looping questions that spiraled endlessly. This wasn’t an outlet. It was swallowing her whole.

He could see the toll it was taking. Her hair was unkempt, her clothes unchanged, her face hollow and etched with exhaustion. She hardly ate or drank. Her world had narrowed to the notebook, and it was consuming her, piece by piece.

He’d given her room to vent, but he couldn’t take it anymore. Watching her spiral in silence was no longer an option.

“Hey...” he said softly, hesitant, as he stood in her doorway. “I’m coming in.”

There was no response.

He stepped into the room, his eyes scanning the chaos. Torn pages littered the floor—some crumpled, others spread flat like artifacts in a shrine. Charlie sat on the bed, the notebook open on her lap, pen in hand, though she wasn’t writing. She stared down at the pages, her eyes unfocused, distant.

“Charlie…” His voice straining under the weight of his worry. “I don’t know how to fix this, but I need you to know I’m here for you. You don’t have to do this alone.”

He moved cautiously, crossing the room to sit beside her on the bed. His arm came around her shoulders, his touch gentle, tentative, as though she might shatter.

She stiffened at first, her body rigid beneath his touch. Then, after a long pause, she leaned into him slightly, her head tilting just enough to rest against him. Her glassy, dull eyes flickered with something—barely a spark of recognition.

“Dad…” Her voice was a fragile thread, barely audible. She hesitated, her breath hitching. “She’s never coming back, is she?”

Al’s chest tightened. The words weren’t really a question; they carried the weight of something she already knew—a truth she had accepted despite the crushing pain.

He swallowed hard, forcing his voice to steady. “No, sweetheart. She’s not,” he admitted. “But I’m here. No matter what, I’m here. We’ll get through this together. I promise.”

She didn’t respond, but she didn’t pull away either. It was a small thing, a fragile connection, but it was something.

 

\*\*\*

 

Several hours later, he managed to get Charlie to lie down for a nap. She never let go of the notebook, clutching it like a lifeline.

He sat at the kitchen table, staring at the remnants of a cold cup of coffee. The image of Charlie haunted him—the hollow look in her eyes, the frantic energy she poured into the notebook. The words she’d written echoed in his mind, just as haunting as the ones left unwritten.

He had to do more. She needed something to pull her out of the spiral—something familiar, something she loved. A faint chuckle escaped him as the answer came to him. Of course. He knew exactly what it was.

Christmas morning, 2017. He could still see her face lighting up brighter than the tree behind her as she unwrapped the electric keyboard. It was sleek and modern, loaded with every bell and whistle a musician could want. She’d spent days exploring its features, experimenting with soundscapes and melodies. Beverly had rolled her eyes at the expense, but Al had known it would mean the world to Charlie. To him, it had been worth every penny.

He’d stretched his modest freelance writing income and savings to cover not just the keyboard but piano lessons as well. Within six months, she was playing better than anyone had expected—even her tutor. But Al knew it wasn’t just talent. It was an escape. During those years of turmoil—when Beverly’s instability and his own struggles drove a wedge between them—Charlie had poured her heart and soul into that keyboard. It had become her sanctuary.

And now, more than ever, she needed that sanctuary back.

The piano was still at Beverly’s house, just waiting, sitting in the corner of the living room.

With sudden resolve, Al stood and grabbed his jacket. If there was even a chance it could help her, it was worth it.

 

\*\*\*

 

Charlie didn’t hear him leave or return an hour later. Lying there, her mind was caught in a relentless loop, memories twisting into cruel distortions that lashed at her fragile self-worth.

A dark female voice in her mind sneered, venom dripping from every word. “See? She didn’t want you. She was just fattening you up for slaughter.”

Her expression was vacant, hollow—the only emotion she could summon. “I wasn’t enough…” she whispered to no one, her voice dry and lifeless.

A faint pulse of heat ghosted over her left shoulder where the Eclipse Mark lay, but she barely registered it. Her eyes remained fixed on the worn pages of the notebook, unable—or unwilling—to look away, trapped in the endless cycle of her unraveling thoughts.

Then… the sound of a trill of notes broke the suffocating stillness, cutting through the haze like a single drop falling into dark, rippling water. For a fleeting moment, the gnawing ache in her chest paused—confusion slipping into the cracks of her numbness.

“Music…?” The word slipped from her lips, distant and hollow, as though it belonged to another life. Her mind strained, brushing against a faint memory wrapped in warmth and light—a forgotten echo of something safe.

The darkness within recoiled, hissing in defiance. “It’s nothing. A trick.”

But the sound lingered, stubborn and alive, carving through the oppressive haze that held her captive.

Another note followed, sharper this time, clear and resolute.

Her fingers twitched—a phantom reflex from years of playing, her muscle memory untouched by grief. The notebook in her lap suddenly felt heavier, its pages cold and lifeless compared to the living pulse of sound that dared to intrude.

A fragile spark of hope ignited deep within her. She clung to it, uncertain, as the notes faded into silence once more.

Would the music return… or was it already too late?

Then it happened again. It wasn’t a trill but a couple of clumsy, hesitant chords. Yet they pierced through her despair like sunlight breaking through storm clouds.

The notebook and pen slipped from her grasp, tumbling onto the floor amid a scatter of torn pages—the aftermath of her internal war.

The fog clouding her mind began to lift. She fought to focus on the sound, the sweet, familiar sound she knew could free her from the soul-consuming despair. She pushed herself upright, groggy but determined. Her legs stretched off the edge of the bed as she stood shakily. Holding onto the railing for support, she navigated each step slowly.

Al heard her and rushed to the stairs. “Hey, kiddo. Do you need help down? I brought you something. I know you heard it.”

He smiled briefly, but his expression turned to concern as she stumbled. He bounded up several steps to catch her before she collapsed, the exhaustion of sleepless nights catching up to her.

Once he got her to the ground floor, he guided her to the bench. He watched her carefully as she sat, her eyes drawn to the keyboard. Al saw the faintest flicker of something familiar as she placed her fingers gently on the keys. Slowly, she pressed down, and a rich, dulcet chord resonated through the room.

She paused, her breath catching as the sound washed over her. It felt too pure, too real for her system. Then, she played.

The first notes were soft, hesitant, but quickly grew into a haunting melody. The song flowed from her fingertips, each note improvising on the pain within her. It was her soul finding its voice, speaking the words she couldn’t.

As the music swelled, silent tears began to slip down Charlie’s cheeks. Her fingers moved instinctively, the melody swelling, louder and faster, as though the keys were the only way to pour out the storm raging inside her. Each note was raw, unfiltered, speaking of betrayal, loss, and anguish.

Her sobs turned to gasps as her hands slammed the keys, the sound growing aggressive and jarring. The catharsis overwhelmed her, and finally, she screamed—a long, raw cry that tore from her chest, shattering the air and shaking Al to his core.

“Charlie!” Al rushed to her side, pulling her away from the piano and into his arms. She resisted at first, her sobs shaking her frail frame, but he held her firmly, his voice low and steady.

“Let it out,” he murmured. “Let it all out, baby. I’ve got you. I’m here.”

Her resistance crumbled, and she collapsed into his arms. Her screams dissolved into broken cries, her pain spilling freely as Al rocked her gently. His arms were a fortress, shielding her as the dam of her sorrow finally broke. His own tears slid silently down his face, but he said nothing more, letting her grief pour out unchecked.

As her cries eventually softened, the room fell silent, save for the faint, lingering hum of the piano. Al began to hum, forming a simple, soothing lullaby. His voice was untrained but warm, the melody wrapping around her like a blanket.

“Rest now… You’re safe...” he said gently.

For the first time in what felt like an eternity, Charlie felt the weight on her chest lift—if only slightly. Exhausted, she leaned into him, her breathing evening out as the last of her tears fell.

The music, the safety he gave her with no judgments, the lullaby—it wasn’t everything. But for now, it was enough.

 

**May 10th, 2022 - 8:21 PM**

The last box of Charlie’s belongings had been moved into the house earlier that afternoon. Al had spent the better part of the past few days coordinating the handling of Beverly’s old place—sorting through the clutter, and ensuring every piece of Charlie’s life was safely brought over.

Now, the house she had grown up in stood empty—a hollow shell of memories and betrayals she was eager to leave behind.

Al hadn’t told Charlie much about the process. She didn’t need to dwell on that house—it needed to stay in her past. Her focus should be on healing and moving forward. But every time he caught her staring out the window in its direction, he could see the weight of her thoughts pulling her down, threatening to drag her into another spiral.

She hadn’t experienced a Shift yet. For that, Al was deeply grateful. She hadn’t seen the suffocating darkness, the desolation, or the horrors that roamed within. He bore that knowledge alone, a burden he would carry for as long as he could. But he knew her time was coming—it was inevitable.

Charlie stood by the living room window, resolute, her gaze locked on the faint silhouette of the part of town where her childhood home still stood. Her hands rested on the windowsill, her fingers absently tracing patterns on the worn wood. The streetlamp outside cast a warm glow that softened her features, but her expression remained distant, unreadable.

“Dad, what happens to the people who aren’t marked? Where do they go?” she asked, her tone oddly calm, her head tilted slightly.

“Nowhere,” he replied, leaning back on the couch behind her. “They’re here the whole time. It’s us that go into the Shift—into a liminal space. It’s like time freezes here until we come back.”

She didn’t respond immediately, her fingers pausing as she processed his words. Al could see her mind working, piecing together fragments of memory.

“Sometimes…” she started slowly, almost to herself, “it feels like everything flickers. Like blinking faster than normal. I thought it was just me being… weird.”

Al sat forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “That’s part of it. Most people notice something—a glitch, a flicker—but they don’t understand what it is. You’ve probably seen it before and didn’t think twice about it.”

She nodded faintly, her gaze drifting back to the window. The quiet stretched between them like a taut wire, the air thick with unspoken tension.

Then, she broke the silence.

“She’s there,” Charlie said suddenly, her voice low but certain. Her gaze didn’t waver from the shadowed house in the distance.

Al followed her line of sight, his jaw tightening. “Charlie… you don’t know that.”

“Yes, I do,” she insisted, her fingers curling into fists on the windowsill. “I can feel it. She’s pulling at me, like she wants me to come to her.”

Al rose, crossing the room to stand beside her. He rested a hand gently on her shoulder, his touch steady. “That’s the mark,” he said quietly. “The Matron’s influence. She’s trying to lure you back.”

Charlie turned to him, her wide, searching eyes brimming with a question she couldn’t quite bring herself to ask. “But what if it’s not just the Matron? What if it’s… her? What if she’s—”

The word “mom” stuck in her throat, unspoken, as though saying it would make the possibility too real. Despite the anger and loathing she felt for Beverly, the thought of her mother becoming a monster was unbearable. It was a finality she couldn’t yet face, no matter how much she tried.

“Charlie,” Al interrupted, his tone firm but kind. “Even if it is her… it’s not safe. Your mom…” He hesitated, his voice weary. “She made her choice. You can’t follow her down that path.”

Tears welled in Charlie’s eyes, but she blinked them away, her jaw tightening. “I just… I don’t understand. How could she do this to me?”

Al sighed, running a hand through his hair. “I wish I had an answer for you, kiddo. I’ve asked myself that a thousand times, and I still don’t know. What I do know is that she didn’t start out like this. She was… lost. And the Matron? She preys on that. On weakness, pain, regret.”

Charlie turned back to the window, her reflection staring back at her like a ghost. “What if I end up like her?” she whispered.

“You won’t,” Al said firmly, squeezing her shoulder. “You’re stronger than she was. You’re still here, and I’m not going to let you go through this alone.”

For a moment, silence filled the room, heavy yet comforting. Charlie leaned her forehead against the cool glass, her breath fogging the surface. “Sometimes it feels like the mark is alive, like it’s… feeding on me.”

Al’s grip on her shoulder tightened slightly. “That’s because it wants you to think that. The Matron’s power thrives on fear and despair. But you don’t have to give her that. You can fight it.”

She turned to him, her eyes searching his face for reassurance. “Do you really believe that?”

His sudden laughter startled her. “I absolutely do,” he said, a faint smile breaking through his usual somber demeanor. “Let me remind you—your stubbornness is unmatched. You refused to sleep anywhere but on the floor by that window until I moved the couch for you. That kind of resolve? It might just save you.”

His expression softened. “Keep your wits about you. You’re a smart girl, Charlie. Just learn to rein in your emotions. I’ll tell you this: stoicism, though difficult at times, helps.”

Charlie felt a flicker of hope—fragile, but real. She turned back to the window, the distant house no longer feeling like a looming shadow, but a relic of the past she had to leave behind.

“Dad,” she asked quietly, her voice hesitant, “we have to do bad things in the shift… don’t we?”

“Yeah,” he admitted, his tone heavy. “Stuff I wish we didn’t have to do. But it’s not like we have much of a choice. Either that, or we turtle up until we’re forced out of hiding.”

Charlie mulled this over, her expression darkening before shifting into something sharp, almost defiant. A sly smile tugged at her lips. “Then I know something I can do during a shift…”

Al tilted his head, wary. “Oh? And what’s that?”

Her smile grew faintly, unmistakably devious. “I can burn Mom’s house down.”

1pgso72,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pgso72/where_the_trees_turn_red/,Where The Trees Turn Red,"Some say it marched out of the sea under a bloody moon, here to expel our town of all hope - a monster to punish the naive prospectors of Maple Oaks who spent their gold on false witch hunts; an avenger of the young women burnt at the pyre, drowning the land for rebirth. Others say it was summoned within the forest, rendering a body of shimmering water an ancient gateway. Not a monster, but a deity from a far-off pantheon to be used as a tool for occult ambition. It brought unrivalled life and good fortune to the woods and its creatures, warping the trees into divine guardians.

I think it was just a man. An affluent founder who built our mines, our port, and, over time, fabricated fables around his locale, concocting utter, fictitious folklore bullshit with the natives that would live on through a local museum.

And his descendants would follow suit, using fiction to hide the truth.

For most of the history class of '85, such fiction ended there - ambitious nonsense about our home's origin, with awe-inspiring malarky attached.

But for Ebony.

Oh, sweet, perfect Ebony.

A switch had flipped in her mind, and an obsession with uncovering the town's secrets had taken hold. Some ancient remnant of this 'thing', whatever it was, must linger somewhere out there, in the woods or across the shore.

Legends need some grain of truth, right?

As the sheriff's daughter, Ebony had every resource and privilege any eager sixteen-year-old could need to hunt local myths.

But, for as keen as she was, her father still set borders. Go dig up the beach and explore the woods, that's fine. But don't go too far out, don't go at night; don't go alone if it can be helped. And, like any spoiled rotten teenager, Ebony ignored all parental guidelines.

This was her quest; she was invincible.

Under the guise of the moonlight, 2 days after she hadn't returned home, by the oldest lake, they allegedly found her slumping out of the ground from where she'd buried herself in a burrow. Her legs were clawed-up and gnarled, her clothes torn, her body broken; whether she had tried to dig herself to safety after being attacked by wolves, or they came upon her while she was unearthing the mystery that lay under the dirt, remained unknown.

For a time.

'Rules' began soon after the story broke, enforced by a grief-stricken sheriff. Beyond a threshold, the woods are forbidden. Period. Yet it didn't prevent whimsical boys and girls from investigating the tantalising, freshly rumoured legend whispered quickly through the halls: Ebony's ghost haunts the forest.

Go at night, go to the lake, and you'll see the distraught phantom of a girl literally killed by her curiosity - still trying to uncover her mystery.

So they instilled a curfew. As the sun dips behind those looming, timeless hills, notoriously unkind officers of the law patrol the streets to ensure no more wayward youths trek into the foliage. And for 30 years, for every family and every home, that same curfew has remained. For those same 30 years, Ebony's story has warped and demented itself beyond recognition as another generation learns of our nocturnal, ritualistic tradition; as another generation questions what she thought she'd found to warrant wandering that far into the wild, in the dead of night. Had she seen anything at all? Or, alone in the woods, had *something* found her, and if so... was it still out there?

I was a part of the latest generation, absorbed by the gospel of the potentially abducted, lured, murdered, raped, cult-recruited, tree-fucking, or whatever sort of stupid girl she was 3 decades ago that made nightly outings impossible.

I was a child when I first truly noticed the odd, sacred hush that descended over our home - my tyke brain finally acknowledging that our life wasn't typical.

""Inside Autumn. Light's getting low."" Dad had called from the porch as the sun began its lazy bleed into the mountains.

I sat in the kitchen, swaying on a stool, as my usually chipper mother locked every door and drew every blind, offering an occasional peek into the dark - her lips pressed and her eyes narrow as her stoic husband stared at the clock.

""Think they'll hit the street early again?"" He asked her.

""Not likely.""

Confused, I asked them both, ""What're you talking about?""

My father looked at me, understanding that his little girl was now sentient enough to question what he found familiar, while Mom continued her routine checks.

""Come here, kiddo,"" he said, ushering me to join him by a window. ""I'll show you.""

Through the curtain, I saw porch lights flicker awake down the street. Neighbours called or forced their kids home with a frantic sharpness, and then, way off up the road towards town, the low growl of a car engine began - silent red and blue and purple headlights weaved between the trees, reflecting off closed windows where curious eyes met it.

""See that car? The lights?"" Dad asked.

I nodded.

""A good, honest man drove one just like it... once. He kept people safe. Until one day, he lost someone very important to him.""

""Did he find them?"" I asked him, too young then to comprehend the cause of this rooted, collective script we recited.

A little lump formed in his throat. ""He did, but-"" He tossed the words around in his head. ""They'd uh... gone to Heaven.""

""Like Aunty?""

""Yeah-yeah, like... like Aunty. And soon after... he went to Heaven too. So now, that car and others like it, every night, carry on what he did.""

""Keep us safe?""

""Exactly. They keep us all safe.""

Mom muttered something profane to herself in the hallway; Dad, ignoring her, continued.

""But to do that, we gotta stay inside. They get grumpy if we get in their way. Understand?""

I nodded, slowly, as another voice spoke from the stairs.

""Do you see her?!"" Sean, my delinquent older brother, who noticed, questioned, and listened far more than I did, asked our Mom.

""*Sean*."" Mom hissed, finally satisfied that our home was secure. His eager eyes scanned the room until they met mine, and a wave of embarrassment washed over him.

""See who?"" I asked quickly.

Dad moved to block my vision as Mom yanked Sean to one side and spat harsh, but heartfelt whispers into his face. Peeking round his frame, I could see the two enter a heated argument of both passion and resentment.

Dad moved my face to meet his, ""You'll catch on when you're older, Autumn.""

And older, I became.

I would come to learn that evenings belonged to the woods and whatever they held, but in our house, that created more wonder than dread. Sure, there was an unspoken caution, a yoke around our necks, but my parents never pushed panic or horror. Instead, their warnings glimmered with something closer to mischief - something my brother adopted far more than I did growing up.

As the routines were finalised, and I came of age, Mom would click the kettle, and Dad would lean back in his chair to recount stories he called 'old myths'. Stories of monsters from the sea and of Gods from the woods, and whatever other fables or fairytales he could remember.

Stories Ebony had told him, before she became one herself - a naive adventurer found half-buried in the earth.

Sometimes, I'd catch a glance between my parents - sharing knowledge, a private joke or insight once hovering beyond my reach.

They'd known her. They'd shared classes. They'd snuck out to go drinking in parks and smoke joints by the lighthouse long after dark.

They'd loved her.

And by God, they missed her - fascinated and frustrated and mortified by her decisions that night that shaped our town into what shaped us.

Sean started to keep a notebook, scribbling down half-remembered details, little theories of his own, the finales of stories that never felt quite finished. I thought it was silly, that he was becoming too obsessed like Mom and Dad's 'ghost friend', but I begged to hear more as much as he did. We'd crack Dad occasionally, and he'd spin a fresh version of some local, rumoured phenomenon or woodland oddity, and Mom would roll her eyes with a hesitant smile tugging at her mouth.

They never pretended to have all the answers, and they never pretended that it didn't frighten them or that the fate of their friend troubled them most nights, but they offered pieces - fostering a hunger in their children to fit them, maybe, one day, together.

But that hunger would starve.

When Sean became a young man, and I became a teenager, we were wise enough to sense what they were too careful to admit. This 'curiosity' would always be expecting, always listening, for answers that would never come - a puzzle left eternally unsolved - because... we *still* had a curfew to respect, we still had rules; a tradition to honour.

Be curious to your heart's content. Explore the parts of the woods where you are allowed during the day, before you reach the barbed fences. But there are borders - don't go too far out, don't go alone if it can be helped, and don't even think for a second about leaving the house at night, let alone going there. And like the good, well-raised children we were, as our curiosity grew bored - but never bored enough - we respected those borders.

Until the one night we didn't.

Until the one night I would tear my skin through bramble and feel dirt fester under my nails, warm blood on my face, and understand what it was that dwelled out there - nesting among crimson trees so foul... and so beautiful.

\-

The daytime brought its own rhythm, and outside our fortress, life moved with the familiar patterns of any town. College was an odd blend of comfort and absurdity. My crowd - a strange, but functional little crew - made such a blend bearable, and sometimes enjoyable.

There was Barney, with his bottomless backpack of books and anxious, bashful heart; always armed with some obscure pulp fiction wisdom or dusty trivia he'd dug up at 3 in the morning.

Kate, a brilliant, gothic dark cloud of sarcasm and wit, adorned in black lace and sharp eyeliner - drifting among us like a raven that had learned to tolerate pigeons. She liked to draw. A myriad of dreamlike monsters filled her sketchbook, asphyxiating me whenever I saw them, as did the wonder that could rarely leave her mouth.

Arthur, trouble on two legs, adored by every teacher he infuriated and the first to disrupt a lecture hall; a cocky shit who always found ways to get us into places we shouldn't be (excluding one obvious exception). Detentions were a weekly event with him, yet somehow, he was the charming glue that held us together in our worst moments.

And finally, me, a theatrical ginger dweeb of fluffy sweaters and radiating rambles.

A four-pointed lopsided constellation, bright in our own humble little orbit.

But then there was an occasional black hole that made its rounds, from a very, *very* different universe.

*Willow.*

She never drifted to our tables during lunch or lingered in the hallways with us. No, she floated above it all. Self-proclaimed queen bee of this backwater nowhere, daughter of the wealthiest family for miles, founder of a circle of vixens and jocks who were always on the edge of danger. If she raised an eyebrow, the room would shiver; if she snapped her fingers, doors opened.

Worse still, she was the white-haired devil whispering sweet nothings into Sean's ear, encouraging my brother to abandon all of his rules and barriers on half-baked promises.

She was not our friend. Being noticed by her was a curse, not a blessing. Her name was poison in our household, detested by our parents - many arguments spawned from the mention of her alone.

But on one afternoon, in the buzzing cafeteria of flickering lights, scraping trays and pockets of laughter, she strode in alone. I was halfway through listening to Arthur tease Barney about the disaster of a date he'd had when, for only a heartbeat, the room fell out of focus as the cafeteria door banged against the wall, damning us into silence, and in she marched - absent of her salivating little wolf pack, licking at her heels and beckoning to her every word.

Her runway-ready, head-turning miniskirts and white leather jackets were gone, replaced by baggy sweatpants and an obscenely large hoodie, the sleeves swallowing her hands. She looked and moved like... well, the rest of us for once.

And her face - Jesus, her face. No canvas of pristine makeup could hide the ugly, angry, blossoming blotch of red and purple bruising that nested under her eye.

Every soul stared as their queen, out of place in her kingdom, made her way to an empty corner table with her head ducked and shoulders hunched. For those precious few minutes, she was just another girl - battered, tired and alone - threatening to vanish into smoke if someone so much as called her name.

And painfully, achingly slowly, the room soon returned to normalcy as its new corner-bound husk lurked at the edges of our vision - something to gossip about.

Barney kept sneaking nervous glances, bewildered at the sigh. ""Snowflake's looking rough today, huh?"" He whispered. ""Who'd you think she annoyed?""

Kate arched a brow, sketchbook balanced on her lap, pretending not to look. ""Maybe her cult of plastic witches turned on her. Looking like shit does suit her, though,"" she muttered with a flick of her pencil.

Arthur leaned in with a grin. ""Or she *finally* ran her mouth at someone who doesn't care who her daddy is... and can throw a mean punch.""

Surprisingly, I found myself just feeling sorry for her. ""Everyone has a bad day,"" I said, not sure if I actually believed it or wished someone would say that about me if I ever sported a glistening shiner under my eye.

Arthur gave a low snort. ""Yeah, you're absolutely right, Autumn. But not a cunt like her.""

Kate then nudged my arm. ""She's looking at you, by the way.""

Those words sent a prickle across the back of my neck. I timidly looked over and, true to Kate's word, Willow was staring at me from her exiled corner, her hood suffocating her face. A silence choked our table and, for a moment, time itself seemed to slow. The cafeteria and its occupants fuzzed away, and all that existed was the space between us. Then she lifted her hand, and a single dior finger curled out from under her sleeve, demanding me to approach with a tiny, effortless motion - one that sent a shiver down my spine and threatened to drag me away from the safety net of my friends.

I shook my head, and the sounds of the room returned.

Arthur snapped his fingers in front of my face. ""Hello? You still with us?""

His voice was peripheral, diluted. Their concerned faces were smudges as they shot bewitching glances over at Willow.

*Willow?*

Willow wanted me.

Barney reached for my arm as I pushed back my chair, mouth full of food. ""Don't! Let her sit by herself.""

Kate, never one to sugarcoat, muttered, ""Yeah, sit down, Autumn. Don't be your brother,"" all while sketching a hollow-staring shade in the margins of her book.

Even Arthur dropped his usual act, scooting to try and block my path, smug grin gone. ""Dude, are you good?""

I wanted to listen, really. I wanted to stay in our planted little pond and laugh at in-jokes. But her eyes dragged me - practically led me on a leash - and I understood then how she could've charmed my resilient brother. Fuck, even looking like crap, she was mystic, humming in my veins while my better judgment screamed to shut her out. I barely noticed my body moving as I weaved around disappointed hands and disgruntled groans and sighs. Logic was gone. Whatever she wanted, whatever grim story she had, I had to know.

And so I let myself hopelessly drift to her table, into her dark mercy.

She glanced at me as I reached her, her bruised face near-unreadable, and then gave her attention to the divided room of interested and uninterested onlookers alike. No one was close enough to eavesdrop.

""Autumn, right?"" She beamed as I took a seat. ""Sean's sister?""

""Who did that to you?""

She didn't answer right away, just shifted, hiding herself even deeper in the folds of her hoodie. I could almost see her weighing in her mind how much to say. Her eyes then snapped to a shape coming closer, dragging a chair in its wake. I didn't need to look to see who it was as an unstoppable surge of confidence came over me.

""Was it your dad?"" Sean pressed, seemingly having manifested out of nowhere, knuckles twitching, eyes flicking over the bruising. He looked over his shoulder at my confused, relieved table of watching friends, offering them a wave and a reassuring smile.

Willow's laugh was a short, bitter burst. ""Oh, please, he wishes he were that brave. No, I just... fell.""

""Was it Ben? You overstepped?""

She paused and then nodded slowly.

""You've been seeing him without me?"" Sean asked.

""You haven’t?""

""Who's Ben?"" I chimed in.

The two looked at me, as if remembering I was there, and suddenly I felt like a little girl in my parents' kitchen again.

""Local press,"" Sean said. ""Red hair, built like a stick-"" he nodded grimly towards his damsel, ""-and the one who encourages this diva to believe she's above tradition.""

My stomach churned. ""You've been out there?! What, at night?!"" I tried not to sound desperate, but the words pathetically dribbled out.

A fowl grin stretched across her mouth. ""I told you she'd be keen."" She said to Sean.

I almost hissed at my brother. ""You too?! After everything Mom and Dad-""

""I've not even left the house *once*, Autumn... I promise.""

""Is that right?"" Willow teased.

""*Yes*."" He spat, pleads and warnings written all over his face. ""And try as you might, nothing you or that *alcoholic* says will change my mind."" He then ruffled my hair, pausing the racing curiosity that began to rush through my head. ""Or yours, I hope.""

Willow's gaze then met mine and held it. ""Y'know, I've heard things out there. You can come listen too if you're not scared-""

Sean planted a firm, but hesitant hand on the table and stood with a huff. ""Catch you later, Wills. Always a pleasure.""

""Oh, come on."" She pouted. ""I won't take her past the fences; even I'm not that stupid... well, maybe just a few feet. We could all go together, the three of us!"" Her voice was thin and cold, but beneath all the bravado, I could tell she was terrified.

The word left my mouth before I could stop it. ""When?""

Sean was quick to usher me away from the table with nought a word, like my life depended on it. Willow watched us the whole time, smiling from ear to ear with the utmost joy.

""Back to your friends, kiddo. Now.""

""I don't... why'd I-""

""*Autumn. Now.""*

I nodded, slowly, and made my way back to my sanctuary as Sean reclaimed his seat in the lion's den. Whatever they said to each other was lost to me, but they remained a pair until the bell rang. His affection became more visible - tucking a hair behind her ear, cupping her hand, all while staring ditzy daggers into her.

The rest of the afternoon was a blur. My friends hounded me, prying me with questions about what Willow wanted, what she'd said, what my brother had said, what the two of them 'were', and why in God's name I'd actually approached her. I deflected, lied, kept quiet - anything to keep them away. Yet their pestering was nothing compared to what the recesses of my own mind were doing to me.

I replayed every word of that conversation and, through it all, one name kept cycling around.

'Ben'

A man who could solve the unsolvable puzzle my parents had harmlessly planted in me.

By the final bell, I couldn't bear it any longer, and I folded. I confided in them everything I was thinking and feeling - another rant bubbling out of my mouth in disjointed sentences that, somehow, they could understand every word of.

Arthur proposed it first, stabbing a straw into his milkshake, after we'd escaped the spilling sea of student-filled halls - clambering their way outside to enjoy the rest of their afternoon - and sought refuge in a cafe booth.

""Why don't we pay him a visit?"" He took a long gulp of some vanilla delight. The others looked at him like he'd killed someone.

""Visit the jittery reporter who punched Willow in the face?"" Barney asked, digging into a slice of red velvet. ""What could go wrong?""

""Well, either that or we break curfew ourselves and let this one,"" Kate began, poking me in the ribs, almost spilling my tea, ""scratch her itch.""

""It's not an... 'itch', Kate.""

""Oh, sorry. Unresolved compulsion then?""

""Hey, back off."" Arthur butted in, and I almost thanked him, until I saw the look on his face. ""It's not her fault she got hypnotised by that white-haired bitch.""

They laughed at my expense; the stupidity, the absurdity of it all. And I did too.

Barney pushed his glasses up. ""Have you considered another outlet? Like, read a book-""

""Or get laid.""

""Or write music!"" Kate seemed exceptionally excited about her own idea. ""I can already picture your first single: 'I Was Found Dead In The Woods At 16'.""

""You guys suck.""

""No we don't.""

Arthur clasped his hands together. ""Anyway! Suggestion still stands: we visit this guy.""

Barney groaned, ""I don't know, man... Mom would always say-""

""Ugh, your Mom says *anything*, Barn. And it ain't up to you, right boss?""

The three of them looked at me: Arthur, eager and giddy; Kate, curious and cautious; Barney, frightened and shaking his head. Was I really going to drag them along to a far-off part of town to question a man I'd never met about local legends and parental bedtime stories, all storming from the unsettling words a girl (none of us liked) had given me?

Of course I was.

\-

The local press office was a rundown, narrow building wedged between a dead laundromat and a fading convenience store - its red brick hull stained dark by years of rain and grime. Dusty, crowded windows made it impossible to see inside, weeds poked through the cracked pavement, and the front door barely held itself together on worn hinges.

""Yeah, no thanks."" Barney squeaked, turning on his heel and walking away before Arthur tugged him back by his ear.

Kate inspected the building, eyeing it up and down like a piece of abstract art. ""Did your brother mention *why* he or Willow talked to this guy?""

""Nope.""

""Marvellous.""

I didn't bother with knocking; I strode right up to the door and stepped inside.

Beyond an unmanned reception, a few desks packed the room - piled high with yellowed notepads, sticky notes and old newspapers. The stink of old coffee, cheap booze, and burnt rubber attacked my nose as I ventured into the rioting clutter. My boots scuffed against the fading floor as a fly buzzed in circles over an empty mug.

""Hello?!"" I called.

No answer.

Kate gagged as she and the others filtered in behind me. ""Ew-fuck. It smells like someone died in here.""

Arthur slapped a cracked counter, fluttering a bundle of papers into the air. ""Perfect. I'm ready to see a ghost, how about y'all?""

""You're more likely to see rats, Arthur."" She added, trailing a finger over a dusty desk, painting lines and shapes.

I found myself drawn to a wall of photographs - a timeline of the town's many faded celebrations and events, but nothing stood out. No mention of our town intertwined with a grand fate; no mention of a lost name.

Barney, at first, hung back - overwhelmed by the smell and disorder. But even he soon found himself drawn in, and he shuffled over to a cramped bookshelf, overflowing with almanacks and faded paperbacks. ""Guys,"" he cried, peering down at the floor, ""come take a look at this.""

We gathered around, not knowing this would be the pivot point, as Barney stared at thin, dark streaks scarring along the floor, half-hidden under the shelf. Arthur's hands immediately flew to its sides, and, with a grunt, he tugged hard. The unit groaned but didn't move. I chose to feel along the edge instead, searching for - there. My fingers brushed a catch beneath the lowest shelf. A soft click sounded, and the whole unit lurched, swinging open on hinges to reveal a dark staircase - stretching down into the guts of the building.

""Oh, God no,"" Barney whispered, with a tiny hint of uncharacteristic thrill.

""You fucking found it, dork,"" Kate said. ""What're you complaining about?""

""And oh, God, *yes*, you mean?"" Arthur joked, eyes sparkling. ""Ladies first."" He then added, gesturing for me to take the first step.

I hesitated, only for a moment, before taking the first cautious step into the shadows with a shit-eating smile on my face.

So quick. So easy. Far, far too easy. No time to savour the anticipation; awe eclipsed every worry, every rational thought, as the adventure unfolded before us. I soaked myself in the thrills, each of my nerves shot with reckless curiosity, not once stopping to ask questions.

It spat us out into a large, sweltering room washed in a sickly, red glow. The stink of alcohol was more pungent down here, wafting through the stale air. Strings of thumbtacks and curling, ancient photographs lined the walls: a blurry picture of an old lake, a crowd at a festival, an evening shot of a rich, starry sky; figures vanishing behind trees, snapshots of a distant woods bathed in purple light, wide-eyed faces from decade-old yearbooks.

A lair adorned with the collections of a private investigator.

Dilapidated, torn pieces of archived newspaper were neatly lined on tables, screaming local tragedies, accompanied by police forms, council records and government files that had almost bled dry of ink - margins etched with hastily scribbled notes. A cold knot formed in the pit of my stomach as my eyes darted over them. Shut away relics of decades past leapt from the pages and clamped themselves to my chest. They should've just been old stories, forgotten pains, but arranged together, they became an accusation.

Dozens of absent resolutions; the words began absorbing together.

'*Search Continues*...'

Fucking search continues, search continues, search continues!

No remains discovered, nothing discovered, nothing e*ver* discovered, no one ever found, no bodies found.

Not even one.

I felt something rising in my throat I couldn't explain. The others had joined me around the table, reading the headlines we'd never known existed in silence, their faces tightening.

A myriad of unspeakable, unanswered losses mouldering for at least 50 years.

This was no adventure; this was a warning.

Kate drifted away from the crowded table and let her attention settle on a map. ""Autumn!"" I ripped myself away, leaving Arthur and Barney to sift through more paper galore. The map was one of the woods (of course), riddled with illegible scrawls and red markings noting boundaries, but what had her focus was an old calendar taped to the corner - days crossed in black marker pen, others circled and annotated with different, tidier hands.

Willow's name was infrequent enough to spot.

And so was Sean's.

My fingers zipped over clustered markings, piecing together how specific dates lined with shaded areas on the map. They'd been charting, beyond the fences, but there was a threshold that even they hadn't dared cross.

That changed tonight.

The air pressed in, and I couldn't breathe. I steadied myself on the edge of a table - shaking, head spinning, heart pounding like a kick drum in my chest. I didn't know what I wanted to find here, but this was *not* it. Distant and muffled, their voices reached me and drew me back; a hand on the shoulder with some grounding words. Arthur said a joke, I think, Barney muttered something soft, and Kate held my hand - it wasn't grand, there was no fanfare, but it was enough.

When I could finally speak again, it came out in a croak. ""What do we do?"" The question hung heavy in the air. Too many options: go to the police (and tell them what?), go to my parents (and be put in solitary?)... or-

Arthur spoke as if reading my mind. ""We could go to the woods.""

""Not a chance!"" Barney whined. ""I've not even... *been* to the fences, none of us have; I'm not going there. And it's bear season-""

Kate couldn't believe what she heard. ""Bears?"" She gestured to the room we stood in. ""That's your biggest worry?... *Bears?* Not the fact that we'll likely vanish into fucking-*""*

""Guys!"" I shouted, for what felt like the first time in years. ""Can we... not argue, please?"" I then looked at Arthur. ""Get a picture of that map.""

Barney shrivelled up into himself. ""No, we can't-""

Kate punched him in the shoulder. ""We can, and we are.""

Retracing our steps, we slipped back up the cracking staircase one by one. Behind the battered front door, afternoon had already begun its dwindling descent into dusk. I don't remember what we said to each other as we fumbled back out onto the street - making and questioning plans in the span of seconds - but I do remember who stood waiting for us.

Sean leaned against the hood of his car, arms crossed, jaw tight. When our eyes met, he opened the passenger door and gave a single, sharp commanding nod to the seat.

No one spoke.

Kate kept looking between us; Arthur bristled; Barney gulped, fidgeting with his pack.

I eventually forced out a small, wavering smile as a revolting, impulsive thought overtook me. Perhaps it *really* was an adventure, a quest... but it wasn't theirs. ""Maybe we just go home and sleep on it instead. Clear our heads.""

""Not a chance."" Arthur pressed quietly.

""Arthur, it's late and I'm tired. I'll text you when I'm home. Promise."" I lied.

""Are you sure?"" Kate asked slowly.

I nodded, and she, unsatisfied, painstakingly gathered the others to start their walks home.

But Arthur lingered. ""See you tomorrow."" He said, more like a demand than a farewell.

Even Barney showed some resistance, but they soon trailed off, leaving me on a darkening street.

I slid into the passenger seat beside my silent brother, and the car door shut with a heavy finality.

He watched my friends round a corner before he spoke. ""Do you want to go home?""

His question slowed the whirling storm in my head. The idea of home - its warm, routine 'normalcy' - comforted me. But it did not scratch gnawing itches. I stared out the window, watching slivers of sunlight begin to hide behind the trees.

""No.""

Sean felt his jacket and produced his little, rugged notebook - its edges worn by years of restless fingers. ""Last chance.""

""I'm sure.""

He managed a comforting smile. ""Okay.""

He put the car in drive, and we took off down the street.

\-

He navigated us through tucked-away, less-travelled roads before the scouts began their patrol, until we reached the town's edge. The car rolled to a stop in an abandoned parking lot infested with pine needles, the depth of the woods just looming beyond a bygone footpath.

At a threshold, the tall, stark black shapes of thick, barbed metal fences, stretching for at least an acre and far higher than any man, tried to ward us away from the wild maw they quarantined.

Not tonight.

Two figures waited beneath a flickering, dying light: Willow, and Ben - red-haired, rail-thin, and staggering slightly on light feet.

Sean killed the engine. A bird called from the trees as he made his way out of the car and towards his crew. I followed tightly behind, not sure what to feel, as Willow offered a happy wave while Ben's rickety fingers twisted around a heavy, military flashlight.

""Who's this?"" He nearly slurred out.

Willow answered before Sean could open his mouth. ""His sister.""

""Huh. Impeccable timing, kid.""

An anxious energy came over Sean. ""Hey, so, maybe we don't go as far-"" he pointed down at me, the pathetic, nervous weight almost attached to his hip.

Ben laughed. ""Don't be getting cold feet, Seany-boy, now you got a tag-along.""

Willow laughed too, and I pretended not to spot the tremble in her lip.

Sean rested a firm grip on my shoulder. ""We'll turn back if you find it too much, okay?""

""Heads up!"" Ben warned, as a stream of red, blue and purple lights danced over a hill and made their way down towards the lot.

We were gone by the time they found Sean's car.

Crunching over brittle grass, we snaked through the woods until we reached the monolith. It seemed flimsy up close, a patchwork of tired metal smeared with rust and graffiti, and dead, segmented searchlights adorning the tops. They found the gap easily - a ragged hole crudely carved into the sheet metal, its rim twisted and sharp.

One by one, we slipped through, and my haste earned a few cuts along my sweater.

For a mile, we pushed deeper in total silence - broken only by a clumsy step and a shiver in the wind. I caught glimpses of little 'X's' marked on some trees and rocks, as the path became rougher, revealing themselves when flashlight cones stroked over them.

I saw a 'W + S' carved into one maple tree, cuddled in a love heart.

Willow's voice nearly scared my skin off. ""Listen.""

Something changed - the voiding silence, gradually, warped into a series of coarse, pained echoing croaks originating from somewhere far, far ahead in the dark. The wind scratched and rattled its way through wounded, cracked bark as my ears strained and every instinct wailed at me to turn around and run.

My brother took my hand instead. And we continued.

""What is that?"" I asked.

""No idea."" Was all he could say.

Night fully settled over the woods, the moon and the stars obscured by dense trees. I couldn't tell how much further we walked or for how long.

I checked my phone.

Dead. Impossible.

Sean noticed. ""Hope you messaged Arthur.""

I hadn't. *Shit*.

Before I could think, we came upon a still, unmoving river stream - flashlights glimmering across the shallow, black water's surface. The three of them stopped. This must've been the edge of their familiarity.

Ben charged forward, producing a polaroid camera from a satchel. It was evident from the way he walked that his courage came from a bottle. I wondered briefly what kind of war waged in his head, as Willow went to follow him.

Sean stopped her. ""We could leave him to it. He'll tell us anyway, whether we're with him or not.""

Willow let out a tiny laugh. ""You want what I want, right?"" Then she looked at me. ""Having fun yet?"" She broke away from him and followed the bobbing head of red hair into the breach.

Sean sighed, hesitant to follow.

""I'm not scared."" I blurted out.

""I know, but-""

I watched sense and reason come over him in a single moment. It hit me, too.

What the *fuck* were we doing?

It lasted only a second; this lucid cut into the adventure, telling us to go home. Then, just as quickly, gleeful shouts and exclamations pulled us effortlessly onwards.

Several meters beyond the river, one tree stood apart - a towering sentinel marred by something uncanny. A crimson mould covered its bark in thick, shulking veins, twisting and threading through its grooves like a cancer. The colour was impossibly rich, both disgusting and hypnotic, and the texture looked more like a synthetic glass.

Then it pulsed, dimly. A faint red glow breathed to life within the mould, slow and steady, synchronised... to the slow rhythm of a heartbeat.

Willow was beside herself as Ben snapped a picture of the growth. Then he touched it.

The mould trembled and released a cloud of faint, powdery spores into the air, which quickly scattered. A single red vein at the root of the tree flared to life, pulsating with more luscious light. It stretched along the ground - its visibility was a complete defiance of logic, as if the earth itself was translucent. The vein bent deeper into the woods.

Like sheep, we followed.

Every single tree was consumed in the same, lurid mass - shimmering in unusual palettes of red and garnet - some far more infected than others. Even the floor was terraformed by the stuff, puffing at our feet. The pulsing lights grew brighter as thick, euphoric fogs drifted among the trunks, sweet and dizzying and as the haze settled... the lights revealed a truth.

Silhouettes - human and animal both - curled, fetal and motionless, were encased and suspended within the bodies of the trees themselves.

""We should... probably leave,"" Sean said, dreary and sheepish. ""Tell someone.""

I cannot explain why Ben chose to rush one of the trees, tearing desperately at the mould in a panicked bid to save the person imprisoned within.

I *can* explain how the forest responded.

The ground convulsed and split open, revealing worming interconnected tunnels beneath us, and a gangling *thing* emerged out at horrifying speed. Its towering, sharp humanoid body was woven of the same pulsing red mould, and it moved with an unnatural, sinewy grace as it mercilessly lunged towards Ben.

It ripped him apart in seconds, splattering us as his flesh tore and bones snapped, his screams lost beneath the swelling, heart-throb of the woods.

The adventure was over. This was a nightmare.

In the chaos and horror, a jolt of raw clarity rushed through me - my vision sharpened, and the soft charm of the woods lifted as I held my breath. I became pitifully aware of the creature's sounds as it clicked and hissed, feeling and searching around its vicinity.

It had no face.

No ears, no eyes, no mouth.

It moved in tandem with the mould's pulse.

Sean came to the same conclusion I did as his hand found mine. He reached into the folds of his jacket and threw his notebook as far as his arm would allow. The creature spasmed and dove to where it landed, clawing and tearing into the ground, shredding the bundle of leather and paper.

Sean's other hand found Willow's, silent and stiff. And we ran.

It was a desperate flight back through the woods, Sean's grip fierce as the monster splintered and retched after us - each step we took triggered a poof of blood-red light to burst from the mould, guiding the thing to us. Every stumble, every cut and scrape, every gasp seemed to vibrate the air as it pursued, tracking our every pace, tireless and quick, but just far away enough.

Then we splashed over the river.

I spun back to see it halt amidst the thicket, shaking, uncertain, its senses dulled - the network of mould beneath it had almost broken. Then it gagged and yelped as the ground opened again, reclaiming its soldier.

The silent trudge back felt much shorter than the journey in.

As we reached the hole in the fence, a searing flash of purple light erupted around us, obliterating the dark. Out of the blur, stern men in dark suits swarmed forward, barking muted commands. They swept us up, herded us away from the woods - no explanation, just tight grips and hurried steps and lights drilled into my eyes.

It was numbing.

Everything passed like a shutter click: the lights, the door, the engine of a police car, the sirens, the walk up my porch. My parents, wild with terror, embraced Sean and me with questions spilling out of their mouths, but all I could do was collapse into their arms, unable to look them in the eye.

My bedroom has never felt this cold; this quiet.

There are slashes up my sleeves and across my hands, my knees are scraped, a gash is across my leg, and I think some of Ben's blood is stained in my eye.

No.

No, no pain pulses in my temples. Not mine; not entirely unpleasant.

I think my brother feels the same.

I see it when I close my eyes.

Not a monster from the sea, nor a God from the woods, nor a ghost girl by a lake.

Just mould. A beautiful, red mass, and a warm tree to rest my head.

Half of me is convinced to grab some kerosene and a match.

The other is a compulsion to go again.

I can go deeper, further. Much, *much* further.

Maybe I'll bring my friends.

I have been struggling with IBS-M for around 20y.

My main symptoms: bloating, gas, fatigued were coherent with SIBO.

I took a breath test in 2021, which was slightly positive for which I was given antibiotics.

Since symptoms persisted and even worsened over time, I took another test in June this year, which was negative.

Then I contacted a gastro via teleconsultation and she noticed I was taken daily Magnesium supplements to combat feet and leg cramps, she said I should switch to topical Mg (a spray) because Mg can interfere with SIBO test.

So I did, I had a very strict diet before the test: literally only black coffee, grilled chicken and rice, and water for 4 days before the test.

She suggested to take a 3-gas test (Sulfur, Hydrogen and Methane), which is done by a Spanish provider, Teletest, that delivers the kit at home.

I took the test and it was very positive for Hydrogen, which is very consistent with the symptoms I have.

Next week I am going for gastroscopy as well, repeating it for prevention, and after that I'll get the antibiotics for SIBO, which hopefully will solve this 20-years long exhausting battle with disease, unhelpful doctors, insurance and people around me who dismiss this very serious health issue.

So if you're taking Mg supplements, beware, they can screw up the gas baseline and give a false negative in SIBO breath test.

# Phases of Fear: The Town That Shifts Into Darkness Part 1A

**Sunday, May 1st, 2022 - 12:17 PM**

Charlie stared at the note, holding its edges. Her mother’s handwriting—once careful, now hurried and uneven—covered the page.

""If you don’t hear from me by noon Sunday, I need you to go to the place marked below.""

Her mother had been gone since Friday.

On the map below, her dad’s house was circled over and over, the pen cutting deep, nearly tearing the paper. A knot tightened in Charlie’s chest. She flipped the page, breath hitching. At first, the back seemed blank—until she tilted it under the light. Faint indentations emerged, half-erased words lingering like ghosts:

*It has to be done.*

*No other way.*

The penmanship was rushed, the letters uneven, as if written in desperation. Charlie’s pulse quickened.

Movement outside caught her eye: neighbors tending fire pits, faint smoke trails drifting skyward. Further down, another family tied red and yellow ribbons to their fence with careful precision.

She’d forgotten—today was Beltane.

Childhood warnings resurfaced in her mind: flickering fires lit to ward off the “Dark Mother,” a shadowy legend to scare children into staying close. Wander too far, they said, and she’d claim you for her “shadowed brood.” Charlie had always dismissed it as folklore, but watching the flames curl higher and ribbons twist urgently in the breeze, unease tightened her chest. This year felt different. Too vivid. Too real.

Her gaze drifted back to the note. She ran a thumb over the paper’s jagged edges, her pulse hammering like it could force meaning from the fibers beneath her touch.

What was this about? Why the map? Why so cryptic?

“Mom, where are you?” she whispered, gripping the note tighter.

Her mom’s disappearances weren’t unusual. Since Charlie turned sixteen, they'd become routine—explained away as sudden overtime or new boyfriends. But this time, the hurried handwriting, the half-erased words, and the map circled repeatedly and nearly torn by pen marks felt unmistakably like a warning.

She mentally replayed the last time she saw her mom, searching for any clue she'd missed. Her mother had smiled warmly that day. But beneath it, Charlie remembered something sharper—fleeting, unmistakably fearful. At the time, she'd ignored it; dismissed it as imagination. But now, that buried detail dug into her memory like a thorn.

And then there was the perfume. Her mom had hugged her that day, and Charlie noticed the vanilla scent—soft, sweet, unsettlingly unfamiliar. It clung to her clothes long afterward, haunting her in a way she couldn’t quite explain.

Charlie’s fingers shook as she dialed the hospital. When the receptionist answered, her calm, detached voice clashed with the pounding in Charlie’s chest.

“She came in Friday to resign,” the woman said, her tone clinical. “Asked for her final paycheck. Said it was a family matter…”

Charlie’s breath caught sharply. “What?” Her voice cracked. “She—she resigned?”

It made no sense. Her mom loved that job—always called it her stability. Charlie barely registered the receptionist’s concerned follow-up, ""Is everything okay?”

“Yeah, sorry.” She hung up, gripping her phone as if it might keep her grounded. Why would her mom leave everything without telling her?

Her gaze returned to the map. There was no denying it—she had to go to her dad’s house. A thought flickered through her mind, uninvited and unwelcome: What if Mom’s already there?

The idea sat uneasily in her chest. She wasn’t close to him—not the way she was with her mom. His strict household rules and controlling protectiveness made every conversation feel carefully measured, like navigating an invisible minefield.

Still, if anyone could make sense of this madness, it was him.

Her parents had never fit neatly into town life. Whispers followed them, labeling them paranoid, eccentric—perhaps even dangerous. Charlie usually ignored the gossip, yet she couldn't deny there was something unsettling about her father, something that kept neighbors wary.

But despite all of it—despite his distance, despite the town’s mistrust—he had always been their fallback. When things spiraled, when the ground beneath them threatened to collapse, he was the one who kept everything from completely falling apart. Whether she liked it or not, he was the only person left who might have answers.

All she could cling to was the fragile hope her mother was safe with him.

Charlie grabbed her purse and house key and stepped outside.

The midday air was thick with something she couldn’t name. As she walked, she noticed details that hadn’t registered before—flickering candles on windowsills, wildflowers tied to porch railings, children skipping down the sidewalk with bundles of sticks. The fires in the neighborhood glowed unnaturally bright, their heat pressing against her skin as she passed.

She stopped at stores, knocked on doors, asked neighbors if they’d seen her mother. No one had. With each closed door, the weight in her chest deepened.

Her thoughts drifted back to the past week. Was this why her mom had seemed so distant?

It had started subtly—little things. Her mother staring out the window, twisting her hair absently. “When you were five, you used to sneak cookies,” she’d said out of nowhere one evening, her voice distant.

Charlie had laughed. “And you knew. You’d catch me before I even took a bite.”

Her mother didn’t laugh. She only watched Charlie for a long, unreadable moment before muttering, “You’re still sneaky,” and walking away.

At the time, Charlie had thought nothing of it. Now, it wouldn’t leave her alone. The feeling it provoked surged through her, and her body was already moving before her mind caught up.

She flew up her dad’s porch steps, nearly slamming into the door. Her fingers scrabbled for the handle, then she pounded against the wood, her voice breaking.

“Dad! Open the door!”

The door jerked open, and there he was. Al. His expression shifted from confusion to concern, but Charlie shoved past him before he could speak.

“Mom! Mom! Where are you?!”

“Charlie!” Al called after her, his voice rising. “She’s not here!”

She barely heard him. Two steps at a time, she tore up the stairs, wrenching open every door.

*Empty.*

*Empty.*

*Empty.*

 With each room, the sick feeling in her gut grew heavier.

“Charlie, wait!” Al was behind her now, his tone firm. “She’s not here.”

At the top of the stairs, she stopped short. Her legs buckled, and she sank onto the step, gripping the railing hard. Her breath came too fast—sharp and ragged against the hush that blanketed the house.

Al crouched beside her, his voice steady, calm—more patient than she remembered.

“Sweetie, slow down. Just sit. What happened?”

Her voice wavered. “Dad… Mom’s gone. I don’t know where. Please—please find her.”

For a moment, he hesitated—then pulled her into a firm hug. She clung to him, her breath hitching in uneven gasps.

His voice softened. “We’ll figure it out, Charlie. I promise.”

**May 2nd, 2022 - 8:30 AM**

Al stood in the kitchen, a steaming cup of coffee in one hand, the phone pressed to his ear. His voice was steady.

“Hi, Bethany. Yeah, it’s Alden. I need to let you know Charlie’s going to be out of school for a while. Family matter came up. I can swing by and pick up her homework—no problem.”

He paused. “Oh… she came by and left a letter with a packet for me?” His grip on the mug tightened slightly. “Uh-huh… okay, I’ll come get them then.”

He took a slow sip of coffee. “Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. I’ll see you shortly.” He hung up, his thoughts still circling.

Setting the phone down, his gaze flicked toward Beverly’s note on the table, then to Charlie. She was slumped in her chair, hollow-eyed and unmoving, as if staying upright took effort.

She hadn’t slept in the guest room he set up for her, insisting instead on staying curled on the couch—close to the door, as if her mother’s knock might still come in the middle of the night.

He’d tried to coax her into a real bed. She wouldn’t budge.

In the end, he did something that caught her completely off guard—he moved the couch over to the main window.

Charlie had blinked as he adjusted the furniture without a word of complaint. He never gave in this easily.

A cold thought curled at the edges of her mind. Was this kindness? Or was something breaking in him, too?

Al exhaled slowly, running a hand over his face.

No more stalling. The talk—the one he’d been dreading—couldn’t wait.

*Oh boy. I’d gladly take the ‘facts of life’ for $400, Alex.*

He cleared his throat. “Hey, kiddo… I know things have been rough, and you probably feel like there’s not much you can do right now.” He hesitated, rolling his shoulders like he could shake off the weight of it. “I’m not usually like this, I know.”

Charlie looked up at him, her exhaustion clear, but a flicker of something else—uncertainty, maybe—broke through.

Al sighed, watching her carefully. “You’ve got that look. Like you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop.”

Her gaze sharpened, her voice slicing through the air like a blade she didn’t mean to draw.

“First, Mom acts all weird and moody. Then she just disappears—just leaves me here with you! Why?! Is she in trouble? She didn’t even explain, just left some dumb note with a useless map—like I don’t already know where you live! And now you’re acting different, like you actually care, and I don’t—”

Her breath hitched; she swallowed, forcing it down. “No. I’m not handling this well.”

The words hung between them, raw and exposed.

Al met her gaze, his expression softening, but he didn’t flinch. She needed answers, and for once, he was determined to give them.

She took a ragged breath, her emotions spiraling out of control. “Dad?! What the hell? Why would she leave me? Doesn’t she love me?!”

Her voice cracked, and before she could pull herself together, Al stepped in, closing the distance between them with quiet force. He wrapped his arms around her, solid, unshaken. She clung to him, her sobs breaking against his chest.

For a moment, she clung to him, her tears soaking into his shirt. His arms were the only thing grounding her, but even as she sought refuge, a nagging thought whispered in the back of her mind: Something is horribly wrong. Still, she couldn’t bring herself to care. All she knew was the hurt, and the one person who could have made it better had simply vanished.

“Okay,” he murmured, voice low but even as he eased her back into the chair. “Take a couple of slow breaths, steady yourself. I’ll head back to the other side of the table—my coffee’s sitting there, and it’d be a shame to let it get cold.”

His dry humor coaxed the faintest smile, one that never reached her eyes. She wiped at her face with trembling hands as she sat back down, her chest still heaving from the sobs.

Across from her, he settled into his chair with an air of quiet determination. But something about his demeanor set her on edge—he was far too serious, his expression strained and tightly controlled, as though bracing himself for a blow he couldn’t avoid.

The air around him felt thick, suffocating, charged with something dark and inescapable. He took a slow sip of his coffee, staring into the cup like it held an answer. When he finally looked up, the weight in his voice sent a slow, sick twist through her stomach.

""Okay… this isn’t some act. What I’m doing right now is the only thing I can think of to make this right. It’s about being the dad I wish I could’ve been for you. And the first part of doing that is telling you the truth, even if it tears me apart.”

Al hesitated, gripping his coffee mug a little tighter, like it was the only thing keeping his hands steady. He glanced at her—really looked at her.

""You being here… it helps more than you know.""

Charlie frowned slightly, something about his tone making her uneasy.

She blinked, her brow furrowing. “How does me being here help you? Help you do what?”

He set the mug down with deliberate care, leaning forward slightly, his hands clasped tightly together on the table. The intensity of his posture made her heart pound.

“Well, let me start with this: For twenty-two years, I’ve been living in something you don’t even want to believe exists.” The words were blunt, almost flippant; however, his expression was anything but. His gaze dropped to his hands for a moment before he looked back at her. “Look, there’s no easy way to say this. I know you’re probably going to think I’m as irrational as a soup sandwich, but here it is: everything I’ve done—and everything I’m still doing—is to survive something that you, thankfully, have never had to experience. And I hope you never do.”

The words hit her like a weight, each one pressing down with an unspoken gravity. Her thoughts tangled, clawing for something solid to hold, anything that might make sense in the storm. He wasn’t joking. He wasn’t hedging. He was speaking like a man laying down an unavoidable truth.

Her mouth opened, then shut, as if words might spill out too fast and drown her. Her mind screamed for logic, but nothing about this had been logical since the moment she walked through his door.

He let her sit in it, gave her the space to process. Then, with a quiet exhale, he continued.

“We’ll get to the particulars in a minute,” he said, his voice strained. “But for now, if your mom sent you here the way she did, then I’m… I’m confused about what she’s thinking. She’s not following the steps we’ve always relied on to survive a Shift.”

Charlie blinked hard, like she could physically clear his words from the air. “A Shift?” Her voice came slow, uncertain. “What’s a Shift?”

Al rubbed his temples briefly, exhaling as if steadying himself. “Oh boy… here we go."" He exhaled, rubbing his temples. His voice carried a weight that made Charlie's stomach tighten. ""A Shift is an event. Something only certain people experience.""

He hesitated before continuing. ""Imagine a twisted copy of Everfall—same streets, same houses… but wrong. Empty. Like the town itself is holding its breath.”

She stared at him, pulse ticking faster. “That doesn’t make sense.”

""No, it doesn’t."" he agreed. ""But it’s real.”

He drummed his fingers on the table before finally saying, “Your mother and I are two of those people. We’ve been caught in it more times than I can count. And it happens without warning—no reason, no pattern. Could last a day, could last…” He stopped, jaw tightening.

""My longest stretch was twenty-nine days.""

The silence after those words was suffocating.

Charlie’s hands twitched, clenching into fists before she forced them open again. This wasn’t real. This couldn’t be real. Her dad wasn’t talking about some secret world—they weren’t in a damn horror movie.

And yet, he didn’t flinch. He wasn’t joking. He wasn’t even trying to convince her—just laying it down like fact.

Her throat tightened. “You actually believe this,” she said, more to herself than to him.

Al didn’t break eye contact. “I don’t need to believe it. I’ve lived it.”

The certainty in his voice made her pulse hammer. A deep, gnawing unease twisted in her stomach—because this conversation wasn’t normal. Because her dad, who had always been the grounded, no-nonsense type, was saying things that didn’t make sense. And worst of all? He was saying them like they mattered.

Her fingers dug into her arms as a nervous laugh slipped out before she could stop it.

“Right. Because now this is about magical disappearances. What’s next—scary shadow creatures? Do you even hear yourself?”

He met her sarcasm with a flat stare. “Your attitude is noted. Now let me finish.”

She swallowed hard. The bite in her voice crawled up her throat like a reflex, but she locked her arms across her chest, trying to cage it there—bracing for impact.

“Fine… but this better not be some made-up excuse for why Mom left.”

Her disbelief landed sharp—sharp enough to cut—but Al didn’t flinch. He held her stare, steady. Unshaken.

“You think this is just a story?” His voice was quieter now, more measured. “Alright. Then explain this.”

Charlie watched, confusion flickering into unease as Al unbuttoned his shirt with practiced care. He rolled the fabric off his left shoulder, movements slow, deliberate.

And then she saw it.

The mark wasn’t just ink. It was something else entirely—something alive. A deep, inky black circle at the center, as if the skin itself had been hollowed out and filled with shadow. Around it, a thin ring of light pulsed like a dying ember, flickering in and out of existence. For a split second, she swore the mark breathed. Like it was watching her back.

Her breath hitched. The room felt colder. Smaller. “What… what is that?” she whispered, barely recognizing her own voice.

Al’s gaze didn’t waver. “This,” he said, his voice grim, “is called the Eclipse Mark. It means you’ve been chosen. It means you’re part of this whether you want to be or not.”

Her mind raced, scrambling for a rational explanation. “It’s… it’s a tattoo,” she stammered, though her voice lacked any real conviction. “You’re trying to mess with me. This isn’t real.”

Al’s expression didn’t waver. “It’s not a tattoo, Charlie. The damn thing pulses on its own. It’s the mark the Matron gives to people she chooses. Once it appears, there’s no going back.”

“No.” She shook her head violently, gripping the edge of the table as if the motion could shake his words loose from her mind. “No, this doesn’t make any sense. This can’t be real.”

“I told you it wouldn’t make sense,” he said, his voice softening, though his tone remained firm. “But think about it, Charlie. Haven’t you noticed the fires? The ribbons? The townsfolk don’t light those just for fun.”

She blinked, confusion flickering across her face. “You mean… the Beltane stuff? What does that have to do with anything?”

“It’s more than Beltane,” he said, his voice steady. “Some of the locals celebrate it every year, some of them Wiccans, others are acting out of superstition, but it’s not just tradition. They say it’s to honor life and rebirth, but the truth is, it’s also meant to ward off something dark. Something ancient.”

Her chest tightened, her breathing growing shallow. “The Dark Mother?” she whispered, the words spilling out before she could stop herself.

Al nodded. “Yes, but she’s really known as the Matron,” he confirmed. “That’s what they’re really afraid of. That’s what all the superstitions are about. The fires, the ribbons, the kids carrying sticks—they’re supposed to protect against her, to confuse her. Sadly, it never worked for your mom or me.”

“And you’re telling me she’s real?” Charlie asked, her voice trembling. “That this Matron is… what? Marking people?”

“She doesn’t just mark them,” he said, his voice grim. “She claims them. That’s what the Eclipse Mark means. Once you’re chosen, you’re tied to her, to the Shifts, to everything that comes with them. If your light burns out—if the mark turns completely black—and a Shift happens, that’s when you join what most people call her Shadowed Brood. But trust me, if people actually saw them, it’s far worse.”

She recoiled, her eyes wide with disbelief. “How long ago were you and Mom marked?”

Al’s gaze drifted off, unfocused, as though staring into a past he’d rather forget. “I’m 43 now, but I was 20 when it happened to me,” he said quietly. “I’ve been fighting to survive ever since. Your mom was marked shortly after me, about six years before you were born. She kept it hidden from you, just like I have, because we didn’t want you worrying about us. We hoped it would never affect you.”

Her gaze dropped back to the mark on his shoulder. Its faint, pulsing glow seemed to mock her, daring her to deny its reality. The weight of his words pressed down on her, her disbelief slowly giving way to a cold, creeping fear.

“This is insane,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “None of this makes any sense.”

He held up a hand, steady but firm. “Charlie, listen. I need you to understand this first.” His voice carried the weight of something he’d repeated a thousand times, but never to his daughter. “People don’t just get chosen at random. The Matron… she picks from those already on the edge. Some are from the poorer parts of town, yeah, but others—” He exhaled sharply. “Others have ties to her. Even if they don’t know it yet.”

Charlie swallowed. “Ties how?”

“That’s for later. Right now, you need to hear this. When a Shift happens, it’s like stepping around a corner into another world—one that doesn’t make sense.”

A flicker of hesitation crossed her face. “What do you mean?”

“First, the town empties.” His voice lowered. “One second, you’re standing in the middle of Main Street, and the next? Gone. Every person vanishes. Then comes the stench. Thick. Wet. Like a septic rot that’s been sitting too long after rain.” He hesitated, his jaw tightening. “And then, the dark.”

Charlie shivered.

“It’s not just night,” he continued. “It’s… different. Thick. Heavy. Even if you had a damn spotlight, you wouldn’t see more than ten feet ahead at times. It swallows everything.”

Her hands clenched in her lap, her knuckles white. “And then?” she prompted, her voice tight with anxiety.

He shifted in his seat, his shoulders stiffening. “Then they come,” he said, his voice low and deliberate, as though saying it louder might summon something.

Charlie’s stomach twisted. “They?”

Al’s expression darkened. “I call them Gloomcrawlers,” he said quietly. “You’ll understand why if you ever see one.”

Her frown deepened. “Gloomcrawlers?”

He nodded, his gaze fixed on the table. “They look human—at first. But their bodies are slick with black gooey crap, their eyes like burning embers pressed into a skull of bone and too many teeth.”

He leaned forward, his voice dipping lower. “They don’t walk. They crawl—like something too heavy for its own skin. But when they’re still…” He hesitated. “They just sit there, watching.”

A chill ran through her. “Watching for what?”

His hands tightened into a clasp. “Your light, kiddo. That’s what they see.”

She blinked. “My light? You mean like a flashlight or—”

“No,” he interrupted, his voice measured but firm. “The kind inside you. The part that makes you want to help someone when they fall or pushes you to make someone laugh when they’re hurting. That’s what they’re drawn to.”

Her frown deepened, her confusion twisting into unease. “How can something see that? How can it even work like that?”

He leaned back, rubbing a hand over his face. “Believe me, I’ve asked myself the same thing more times than I can count. But it does. And the only way to stop them from seeing you is to cover it up. To make your light dim enough that they can’t notice it.” His words felt dirty, as though even saying them out loud was a betrayal.

“But how do you do that?” she asked, her curiosity tinged with growing dread.

His jaw tightened, his expression clouding. For a moment, he looked as though he might not answer. Finally, he said, “By doing things that go against that light. Things that cast shadows on it. Things that aren’t…” He paused, searching for the right word. “Well… Good.”

Charlie’s stomach turned, a cold knot forming in her chest. “Like what? What kind of things?”

He shook his head slightly, his eyes dark and distant. “You don’t want to know, kiddo. Not really. I’m praying you never have to find out.”

“But if this is true,” Charlie pressed, her voice rising with frustration, “and Mom sent me here, then why would she just leave?” Her voice cracked, and she shook her head, unable to finish the thought.

Al’s face hardened for a brief moment before softening again as he looked at her. “That’s what I’m trying to figure out. I saw she underlined “marked” on the note but I don’t know what that means. However, I swear to you, we’ll get to the bottom of it.” He leaned forward, muttering almost to himself, “How does she think she’s leaving town? That’ll be interesting.”

Then, louder, his tone earnest, he added, “Anyway, for now, you have to trust me. Everything I’m telling you, everything I’m doing, is to protect you. Even if it doesn’t make sense right now.”

Charlie shivered, wrapping her arms tightly around herself. “So, if I don’t have it… the mark? I can’t… Shift?”

“Exactly,” he confirmed. “But once it’s there, you’re marked for life. There’s no removing it. There’s no escaping it.”

She hesitated, her hand brushing the back of her left shoulder, suddenly self-conscious. “How would I know if I have it? Should I check?”

His expression softened slightly, though the weight in his eyes remained. “You’d already know if you did, so you’re probably fine. It burns when it first shows up, like someone’s pressing a hot iron into your skin.” He hesitated, his voice turning serious. “Now, listen to me. If you ever feel anything—anything strange—tell me immediately. Promise me.”

She nodded quickly, her heart pounding. “What happens if someone gets the mark? How do they… survive?”

Al’s face hardened, the lines around his mouth tightening. “That’s where it gets complicated. Once you’re marked, your light—your soul—becomes a beacon. The Gloomcrawlers are drawn to it, and they won’t stop until they find you. The only way to survive is to dim your light, to mask it.”

Her stomach twisted, a sick feeling settling deep in her gut. “How do you do that?”

He hesitated, visibly grappling with the answer. When he finally spoke, his voice was low, laced with regret. “By doing acts of destruction, violence… cruelty. The darker the action, the dimmer your light becomes. It makes you invisible to them.”

She recoiled slightly, her eyes wide. “That’s… that’s horrible. You have to become evil?”

He shook his head sharply. “No, not evil. I’ve figured out how to twist it just enough to create a loophole. You fight to reclaim your light here, but you have to be willing to get your hands dirty over there. Certain actions you take don’t carry over. But others—like involving or hurting people in the Shift—that’s a dangerous path. One you can’t come back from without massive change. That’s why I’ve always had a guest room ready for you, just in case. But you’ve only stayed an afternoon every now and then. Your mom and I…” He paused, his voice heavy with unspoken emotion. “…we had issues. Things happened so you’d end up staying with her.”

The room fell silent, the weight of his words pressing down on them both. Charlie’s mind spun, her thoughts racing between disbelief and the growing, terrible understanding of the world her father was revealing to her.

“Now… remember when I said that acting kind to you would save me?” His tone softened, his eyes meeting hers with a rare, shimmering hope she hadn’t seen in him before. “That’s how I rebuild my light—I have to be kind to people. And believe me, that’s not always easy, especially when they’re terrible people. But it’s what keeps me from becoming one of them.”

“Become one of them?” she repeated, her voice trembling. The question wasn’t just curiosity—it was fear, raw and unguarded. If this was real, if everything he said was true, the thought of becoming one of those creatures made her stomach churn.

He nodded slowly, his expression grim. “Yes. It can happen. The more you dim your light, the closer you get to the darkness. You do what it takes to survive, but every time you cross that line, it pulls you further in. If you let it consume you…” He trailed off, his jaw tightening.

She swallowed hard, trying to steady her voice. “So, if someone gives in too much, they turn into a Gloomcrawler?”

His silence was answer enough. Finally, he said, “Not everyone. It’s the truly evil ones—the ones who’ve given up their light completely. They stop being human long before the Shift takes them. Once they cross that threshold, the Matron… she claims them.”

Her breath hitched. “The Matron? You mentioned her before. Who is she?”

He leaned back in his chair, running a hand through his hair as if the name itself weighed him down. “She’s the one who rules over the Shifts. The one who decides who gets marked. No one knows what she really is. Some say she’s a demon; others think she’s a force of nature, feeding off the darkness of this town. But one thing’s certain—she’s the one pulling the strings. “

Her chest tightened, her mind brimming with a thousand unspoken questions. “Why would she choose someone? What does she want?”

His eyes darkened. “That’s the part no one understands. Some think it’s punishment, others say it’s random. But I’ve seen enough to know she doesn’t do anything without reason. The truth is, once you’re marked, she’s chosen you to be part of her game. She’ll push you to the edge, tempt you to give up your light entirely. And if you’re not careful, if you let her win…” He let the words hang in the air, their implications chilling.

She sat frozen, her mind reeling. “Is that why Mom left? Did she give in?”

His face tightened, his eyes flickering with a pain she couldn’t place. “I know your mom was struggling, and I tried to be there for her. But I’m not sure. There were things she never let me in on… and some things I only learned after it was… well, too late.” He hesitated, his voice faltering. “Look, I’d rather talk about that another time.”

The words sent a jolt through her, frustration surging to the surface. She snapped, her voice rising. “How much more am I supposed to wait to know the truth? About her, about this town, about why any of this is happening to me?”

“I’ve never spoken badly to you about your mother, and now you’re asking me to tell you how vile she could be? Are you serious?” he said firmly, his voice carrying a mix of frustration and sadness. “You need me to explain all of this first before I start dropping mental shrapnel into your head. I understand you’re impatient and want answers—so do I.”

He glanced down at the table, closing his eyes briefly as he exhaled a deep sigh. “Beverly, I swear, you better be messing with us,” he muttered under his breath. When he looked back at Charlie, his gaze was sharp and resolute. “With your mother’s disappearance, I’m worried the Matron may have her eyes on you. We don’t have time for you to fall apart. For now, you have to stay strong. I don’t know what happened to your mom, but when the next Shift comes, I’ll be able to know—quick.”

The room seemed to grow colder, heavier. Charlie’s gaze dropped to the floor as her thoughts churned, the weight of everything pressing down on her. Her mother, the mark, the Gloomcrawlers—it was too much, too fast. But somewhere deep inside, beneath the layers of fear, a small ember of defiance flickered.

She looked up at him, her voice steadier than she expected. “Then what do I need to do while you’re in the Shift?”

A chill settled in her bones as he continued. “You won’t even know I’m gone. To you, it’ll be like I never left—time here just stalls, like the world takes a breath and waits for me to come back. It’s like nothing ever happened. If something gets destroyed over there, it resets. No cracks. No proof. It’s a reality out of sync with this one.”

He exhaled slowly. “It looks the same, but it isn’t. No people. The air turns heavy, and the smell…” His jaw tightened. “It sticks to everything.”

His gaze flickered to hers, sharp. “It’s a liminal space, Charlie. A waiting place. A version of this town that isn’t fully here or there.”

She swallowed, her throat dry. “And the darkness?”

“It presses in.” His voice was barely above a whisper. “Like something alive.”

He paused, his eyes going distant as if lost in a painful memory. “When we come back, we have to rebuild our light. It’s the only thing that helps us survive the next time. But sometimes… it wears you down and…” He hesitated, his voice faltering as the weight of his next words loomed heavy. “I’ve had to put someone down who… who changed.”

The silence that followed was oppressive, thick with the unspoken fears hanging between them.

Charlie’s stomach twisted. He wasn’t saying it to scare her—he was saying it because she needed to know. Because at some point, if she wasn’t careful, if she wasn’t strong enough…

*No.*

She pressed her palms into her lap, grounding herself. She wouldn’t let that happen.

Al exhaled, the weight in his shoulders easing just slightly. He stood, moving to the sink with quiet purpose. The clink of his coffee cup against the porcelain was the only sound for a long moment.

Then, finally, he spoke.

“I have to go pick up that letter and packet your mom left for me at your school,” he said. “You can stay here, or you can come with me, but you’ll need to stay in the truck. Your choice. But I have to leave now.”

He paused, watching her closely, his gaze unwavering, as if bracing for her decision.

Charlie hesitated, the memory of the pulsing light from his mark vivid in her mind. It lingered, insistent, like a warning she didn’t yet understand. The image replayed, pressing at the edges of her thoughts, too heavy to ignore. The mark—it was unlike anything she had ever seen. And yet, as impossible as it seemed, it felt undeniable. It wasn’t just a story. It was truth.

She glanced up at him, his expression unwavering yet tinged with something softer, something almost tender. Beneath the grim exterior, there was concern, maybe even fear. It struck her then: he was all she had left.

Finally, she nodded, her voice barely a whisper as she spoke. “I’ll go with you.” Saying it aloud felt like crossing an invisible line, making the moment all too real.

His gaze relaxed, a flicker of relief breaking through his carefully controlled demeanor before he composed himself again. “Good,” he said. “When we get there, stay in the truck. I won’t be long.”

She didn’t argue. The fear of being left behind, of being marked—whatever that truly meant—was far worse than the uncertainty of following him. For now, being near him, no matter how frustrating he had been in the past, felt safer than the unknown waiting on the edges of her understanding.

 

\*\*\*

 

They pulled up to the school, the building standing quiet and imposing in the midday light. Charlie sat motionless in the passenger seat, her fingers fidgeting against the worn leather of the truck’s seat. The hum of the engine died as Al cut the ignition, and he glanced at her briefly before stepping out of the truck.

“Stay here,” he said, his tone gentler than usual. “I won’t be long.”

She nodded, her gaze fixed ahead. Uncertainty swirled within her—about the mark, the Shift, her mother. The slam of the truck door startled her, and she watched as Al walked toward the school entrance, his posture rigid.

Inside, Shawna, the school secretary, greeted him with a raised eyebrow. Her expression was a careful mix of curiosity and wariness, like she wasn’t sure what version of him she was about to deal with.

“Alden,” she said, tilting her head slightly. “You don’t come around much… and definitely not in an ok mood.”

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. “I’m here for the letter and packet Beverly left.”

She studied him for a long moment before exhaling. “I heard about Charlie,” she said carefully. “Is it true? Beverly’s gone?”

Al’s tone turned dry. “So, the rumor mill’s still running strong. Good. Saves me from explaining.”

She shook her head lightly, ignoring the sarcasm. “Well, it didn’t help that Charlie was banging on everyone’s door on the way to your place.” Her lips pressed together, hesitation flickering across her face before she continued. “Look… I know Beverly made some bad decisions. And you were usually the one left cleaning up after her.”

She hesitated, then let out a small sigh. “Not that you were a delight to deal with either,” she added, though her voice lacked its usual sharpness. Her gaze flicked over him, as if measuring how much he’d actually changed. Then, after a beat, her expression softened slightly. “But this is the first time I’ve seen you here with any intention of being reasonable.”

Shawna reached behind the desk and pulled out a sealed envelope and a thick packet, sliding them across the counter. She kept a finger on them for a second before letting go. “This is her letter,” she said. “We kept a copy. It states you’re now the sole and primary point of contact for all of Charlie’s health and education decisions. Everything. She said to give you the packet when you came. There, legalities are done.”

His expression barely shifted as he picked up the envelope, but his grip on it tightened slightly. “Noted.”

She hesitated again, something unreadable in her expression. Then, her voice quieter but firm. “Look, whatever’s going on, if Charlie needs anything, if she starts struggling, tell her to reach out. The school will do what we can.”

He blinked, caught off guard by the unexpected offer. He hadn’t anticipated any of this.

She gave him a knowing look. “Take care of her, Al. She’s a good girl.”

He gave a brief nod, slipping the packet under his arm as he turned to leave.

Back at the truck, Al climbed into the driver’s seat and started the engine, the low rumble filling the silence between them.

“Let’s get home,” he said, his voice distant as he pulled onto the road.

Charlie’s gaze flicked to the envelope on the dashboard. The thought of her mother’s words—sealed, unread, and completely out of her hands—made her stomach twist.

“What did she say?” she asked finally, her voice quieter than she intended.

His fingers flexed against the wheel. “The letter names me as your primary parent. I’m in charge of your decisions now.”

Charlie’s throat tightened. The finality of it struck hard, cold and absolute. Not ‘until she gets back.’ Not ‘for now.’ Just gone.

She looked out the window, her breath unsteady, and swallowed down the lump rising in her throat.

“I’ll open the packet when we get home,” he added after a beat. His voice was unreadable. “I’m not sure what to make of it yet.”

I work full time Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday but sometimes they need me to work another day.

I got no reply. Yesterday they texted me asking what days I needed off for Christmas because they wanted to make the schedule. I told them again and kinda assumed they would switch my Tuesday shift along with the schedule.

I appreciated this text and later was talking to my sister who works Saturdays if she might be free to work for me since she has winter break soon. She said she has finals that morning but could come in at 10:30. I thought that was perfect and texted my bosses: “Sister said she can come in at 10 for me! So I can come in opening until she gets there”

My other boss texted back: “We are working on it and we’ll let you know…”

??

I found a solution and they won’t take it? Im kinda confused too since that boss got really mad at my sister last time she worked and my sister is considering quitting. Tbh theres been so much bad managing that I might just cut back my hours too. I feel bad though since Im the only full time person who can work all day. Everyone else is a student or works in the kitchen…

1pgsfo8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgsfo8,Foyer feature wall,"I’m looking to bring some life to my foyer. I’ve been thinking about adding a board and batten feature wall, similar to the one in photo 1. My house is open concept, and the foyer wall continues into the upstairs living room, which you can see in photo 2. That’s where I’m stuck.

I’m not sure where the feature wall should end. Should it stop at the pony wall, continue to the fireplace, or run along the entire length of the wall? I’m also open to the idea that maybe a feature wall isn’t the right move.

I’ll be renovating soon and installing new LVP throughout the home, so this would be a good time to commit to a direction. Another thing I’m unsure about is whether stair risers should be painted white or finished in the same LVP. If anyone has thoughts or experience with that, I’d love to hear it.

All walls will be painted Swiss Coffee by Behr. Any advice or ideas are appreciated.",1,1765138695.0,interiordecorating,0,0.67,False

Looking for advice on next steps and pitfalls,"I am in the early idea stage for my first business and could use some guidance from people who have already built something from scratch.

The concept is a recurring, hands on workshop where people create a small plant based project and enjoy a relaxed social atmosphere at the same time. Think simple, beginner friendly builds paired with a coffee or wine type setting. The goal is to make it feel like a fun night out that also gives people something they can take home.

I have done a good amount of research and mapped out a few possible directions, but I still feel like I am reaching that point where I am not sure what I should be focusing on next.

I would love advice on a few things:

* **Idea validation:** At a high level, does this type of creative workshop model seem workable in the small business world
* **Business planning:** What would you handle first if you were starting something similar
* **Risk assessment:** For anyone who has run event based or experience based businesses, what surprised you in the early days
* **Pricing and margins:** Any tips for avoiding common mistakes when materials and prep time are a big part of the cost structure
* **Operations:** How do you manage attendance unpredictability, prep work, and scaling beyond yourself
* **Marketing:** If you have run local service or event style businesses, what channels actually moved the needle for you

I am not promoting anything and I am not looking for market research. I am just trying to avoid rookie mistakes before I get too far down the wrong path.

Any insight from small business owners who have navigated this kind of work would mean a lot. Thanks in advance.

1pgsc86,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgsc86,"Padron 2000 Maduro Review – A Dark, Delicious Everyday Classic","The Padron 2000 Maduro is one of those rare cigars that manages to walk the line between affordable and exceptional. Built with the same DNA that defines Padron’s legendary reputation, this robusto sized Nicaraguan puro features a dark, toothy Maduro wrapper and the unmistakable consistency the brand is known for. It’s not flashy. It’s not complicated. But it is reliable, rich, and deeply satisfying.

I lit one up after dinner with a pour of spiced rum—ready to sink into its earthy warmth and see if the hype surrounding this budget friendly Padron still holds up.

Presentation & Cold Draw

The wrapper is dark and rugged, with visible veins and a natural tooth that gives it a rustic charm. The box press is firm, and the cap was neatly applied.

On the cold draw, I picked up earth, cocoa powder, leather, and a faint dried fruit sweetness. The draw was near perfect; just as a Padron should be.


First Third

The cigar wasted no time getting down to business. The opening puffs delivered a wave of espresso, dark chocolate, and black pepper. There's a roasted, almost charred nuttiness underneath, with a satisfying bitterness - think high cacao dark chocolate or well done coffee.

The retrohale carried a firm pepper hit, but it wasn’t aggressive; just enough to remind you this is a Nicaraguan puro with attitude. Smoke output was thick and oily, coating the palate in earthy richness.


Second Third

As I moved into the second third, the flavor profile deepened and rounded out. The pepper eased back, letting more earth, roasted coffee beans, and bittersweet cocoa shine. A subtle sweetness emerged - think molasses or raisin - adding a layer of complexity without taking away from its bold, gritty character.

The burn was slightly wavy, but it never needed correction. The ash held on in thick, compact stacks, reflecting Padron’s dependable construction.


Final Third

In the final third, the strength subtly ramped up, as did the richness. The profile turned more toasty and leathery, with a background of dark spice and charred oak. The sweetness tapered off, leaving behind a bold, clean finish that lingered just long enough to keep you thinking about it.

Even as I got close to the nub, the cigar stayed cool and flavorful, never getting harsh or bitter - just more condensed and earthy.


Final Thoughts

The Padron 2000 Maduro is a workhorse cigar—one that delivers full bodied flavor, rugged charm, and consistency at a price that’s hard to beat. This cigar is all about rich Nicaraguan flavor, expert construction, and a satisfying experience you can count on every time.

With a smoke time of 60–75 minutes, it’s ideal for when you want boldness without overthinking things. Would I smoke it again? Absolutely - and I already have. This is a cigar that earns a permanent spot in the humidor for those everyday moments when only a Padron will do.",6,1765138458.0,cigar,0,1.0,False
