1p0g041,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1p0g041/i_was_tired_of_missing_opportunities_because_i/,"I was tired of missing opportunities because ""I didn't have a photo,"" so I built an AI photographer that actually looks like me","Two years ago, I tried posting on LinkedIn every single day.

Made it about a week.

The problem wasn't writing. It was the stupid ""add image"" button.

I'd write a solid post, get to that step, and… freeze.

The only photos I had were from a wedding in 2022 and a blurry coffee shop selfie that made me look like I was having an existential crisis.

So I'd tell myself: _""I'll post tomorrow when I have a better picture.""_

Tomorrow never came.

It sounds small. But that tiny pause became this guilt loop that killed all my momentum.

I realized the issue wasn't laziness it was logistics.

Photoshoots cost money. They take time. You have to coordinate schedules, hope the lighting works, and pray you don't look weird that day.

So I just… stopped showing up online.

That's when I started building [Looktara](http://looktara.com/).

The idea was simple: What if I could train an AI to be my personal photographer?

One that actually knows my face, my expressions, my viben and could generate a real-looking photo whenever I needed it.

Here's how it works:

1. Upload \~30 photos of yourself (once)

2. We train a private, encrypted AI model in about 10 minutes

3. After that, type something like _""me in a navy blazer speaking on stage""_

4. Get a studio-quality photo in 5 seconds

No plastic AI skin. No uncanny valley. Just… you.

I've been testing it with about 30 LinkedIn creators and coaches over the past few weeks.

The feedback has been wild:

- One creator went from posting 2× a week to daily. Her engagement tripled.

- Another landed a $8K brand deal because her feed finally looked active and professional.

- Most just said they feel _lighter_ not ""AI-excited,"" just relieved they can finally show up without friction.

The part that surprised me most?

People don't say _""wow, cool render.""_

They say _""I finally have photos that look like me.""_

There's something weirdly emotional about removing that invisible barrier of _not being seen_.

I'm curious what builders here think:

Would you use something like this?

Or does ""AI-generated photo of yourself"" feel like crossing some kind of line—even if it looks 100% like you?

Also open to any feedback. We're still early and figuring out what people actually need vs. what I _think_ they need",1,1763482270.0,indiehackers,0,1.0,False

That initial impression shapes whether they'll spend time exploring the rest of the property or move on to the next listing. Getting your home ready to show isn't about expensive renovations—it's about making smart choices that highlight what you have.

  
Start with curb appeal. In Faribault and Owatonna, a clean driveway, trimmed landscaping, and a fresh coat of paint on the front door go a long way. Buyers in Steele County and Rice County notice these details. Inside, declutter every room. Remove personal items, excess furniture, and anything that makes spaces feel cramped. Neutral colors work better than bold ones because they help buyers imagine themselves living there.

  
Next, address obvious maintenance issues. Leaky faucets, squeaky doors, and burnt-out light bulbs signal neglect. Fix these before showing. In Waseca and Mankato areas, buyers expect homes to be move-in ready or priced accordingly. If you're not willing to fix small things, expect lower offers.

  
Clean is non-negotiable. Deep clean everything—baseboards, windows, carpets. A clean home feels well-maintained, even if it's older. Baking soda and fresh coffee brewing during showings create a welcoming atmosphere.

  
Finally, think about what buyers will actually use. If you have a deck or patio, make sure it's inviting. If you have storage, organize it. These functional spaces matter more than you'd think.

He really is very dense. Just look who Robert has been stood next to the whole time he was at the party. Kev should try putting two and two together, remembering what Aaron said to him when he first came to the village (""Before you came here, he was all over me."") and also think about what Charles said about Robert returning around the time Aaron and John were getting married.

Also, if the attendees of the party weren't aware, they must be by now. All the evidence is stacking up. 

1. Robert and Aaron attend the party separately but seem joint at the hip and there's a familiarity between the two of them again. Aaron is smiling and looks happy. 

2. Kev mentions about Robert splitting up with him and not understanding why. 

3. Quiet conversation and shared looks between Robert and Aaron. Talk about whether Robert should go after Kev. 

All those that were there during their first stint as a couple must know they are back together.  Their touching when Robert first arrived at the party nearly squashed Vinny, it was that powerful. ",3,1763482124.0,robronaddicts,1,1.0,False

I’m 21 years old I have ADHD. I enjoy reading (currently on Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking, and crafting. I make a million playlists for every mood and then proceed to listen to none of them and save them on my iPod because apparently I’m a digital hoarder.

Not a movie girlie but I do love watching series now and then (currently binging Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I like cafés, drinking too much coffee or tea, doing online crosswords, falling into YouTube rabbit holes, and reading random Wikipedia pages .I speak three languages and I’m slowly learning a fourth. I’m open to talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click .

Some things to expect if we become friends 
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)
• Random song recommendations 
• Someone you can annoy at any hour
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

Challenge From His Luna

Chapter 1

I was a lawyer who specializes in handling cases about cheating and dissolving mate bonds. Never had I imagined I’d be the one being “challenged” by the mistress.

Just moments ago, I received a mind link from my Alpha mate, Nathan Foster, “Babe, how’s your day going?”

The next moment, his “fiancée” walked into my law firm.

She was breathless with excitement, feigning coyness as she said, “I’d like to hire you to help me terminate my fiancé’s mate bond. He says his mate is a complete shrew, so we’d better show her some respect.”

I glanced at the intake form.

Client name: Nathan Foster.

There was a photo attached to the file, the same face I’d seen every morning for the past nine years.

But now? He felt like a stranger to me.

Oh, how ironic. I’ve been a lawyer in this regard for five years, helping to break up countless mate bonds.

And today, the tables have turned.

Congratulations, Nathan. You’ve just handed the one lawyer in New York who will make you regret everything over to your mistress.

… I closed the file and looked up at the shewolf sitting across from me.

She wasn’t stunning, maybe just pretty. She had a petite frame, the kind only a shewolf who’s never had pups could have, delicate and slender.

She spoke with grace, clearly well-mannered, but there was a certain naïve purity to her, suggesting she had lived a sheltered life.

When she mentioned her “promotion,” I caught a flicker of smugness in her eyes, but also a hint of nervousness.

“Ms. Brooks, so… what do you think we should do?”

“My fiancé wants his partner to quietly step aside. You know, to avoid ruining the old relationship. He doesn’t want to cause trouble,” she said softly, her lips curling into a shy smile.

If I didn’t know for sure that she had no idea who I was, I’d think she was mocking me.

I forced a professional smile. “Ms. Ross, how long have you two been together?”

She blinked, caught off guard. “What?”

I slowed my pace, speaking deliberately.

“Before I can offer you legal advice, I need to understand every detail of your relationship.”

“Oh! Okay.” She nodded, her voice becoming soft and dreamy.

But with each word she spoke, my smile grew colder.

“We’ve been together for two years. We met at a charity gala.”

“His family had just learned that someone had been diagnosed with a serious illness. He was really down, standing alone on the terrace. I just happened to pass by, and we… talked for a while…”

Her cheeks flushed lightly.

“We hit it off right away. Less than a month later, we started officially dating.”

Listening to her sweet little love story, my chest tightened, like someone had gripped it in a fist.

“Did you see him two years ago, on this day?”

“Wait, how do you know that?” Her eyes widened in surprise.

I gave a slight smile, my eyelashes hiding the frost in my gaze.

Of course I knew. Since two years ago today, my father suffered a severe heart attack. He passed in the emergency room at NYE (New York Elders) Pack Hospital.

At the same time they “met,” I had been kneeling outside the emergency room, broken. I screamed and cried until my throat was raw.

Old wounds tore open again, the pain cutting deep, again and again.

I took a deep breath and moved on to the next question.

“Did you know he has a four-year-old son? He just started kindergarten.”

“Oh, yes,” she said, her shy demeanor instantly replaced with utter confidence.

“He promised me that after we bonded, I would be Marcus’s mother. Anyway, little pups don’t remember anything. The werewolves who love them are their real parents,” she said, looking at me, seeking my approval.

“Don’t you agree, Ms. Brooks?”

I clenched my hands so hard knuckles turned white, but I kept my expression calm.

“Of course. You’re absolutely right.”

Too bad you’d never get the chance.

She completely relaxed, letting her guard down. She continued, speaking almost cheerfully.

“He even showed me pictures of his mate. She had a C-section scar on her belly, looking deep and ugly. He says every time he sees it, he feels disgusted.”

She chuckled lightly. “Ms. Brooks, don’t you think that shewolf is pathetic? Why is she so obsessed? How desperate must she be?”

I smiled too, my gaze stiff.

“Have you considered the possibility that his mate has no idea he’s been cheating?”

Chapter 2

“Impossible!” Amelia’s voice was sharp and absolute.

“Nathan can’t even stand to touch her. Unless she’s out of her mind, she couldn’t miss it. With me? He’s passionate, desperate. But with that ordinary shewolf at home? He says he feels suffocated.”

“Ms. Brooks, seriously, wouldn’t you find it strange that you haven’t had sex in two years?”

“I would,” I blurted out, but my gaze was fixed on the Cartier mate bond ring on my finger.

Nathan and I came from different packs, but at 18, we met at the same Lycan training camp. The moment we met, our wolves recognized each other.

We trained together, fought side by side, and when we won first place in the Lycan Training Competition, he confessed his love, and I said yes without hesitation.

We’ve been lovers, then bonded mates for nine years.

When I had pneumonia, he drove three hundred miles through a snowstorm in the middle of the night just to bring me medicine.

When I was upset, he would scour all of Manhattan just to find my favorite bakery.

When I was pregnant and gave birth, he never missed a single checkup.

Every time he came home, he would hug both Marcus and me and tell us we were the best parts of his life.

Even when we stopped sleeping in the same bed two years ago, he explained it gently.

“Baby, giving birth to Marcus wrecked your body. I can’t let you go through that again.”

I thought that once the passion faded, the mate bond would settle into gentle, stable love.

I never thought he’d seek gratification elsewhere.

A chill rushed through me, straight to my chest. I forced out the last question.

“So, you just want her to propose the dissolution of the mate bond? Just like that?”

“No,” she shook her head forcefully.

“The most important thing is, his mate can’t find out he’s been cheating. Yes, she helped Nathan achieve once, but his current success is all his own. If she finds out, she’ll ruin him!”

“Ms. Brooks, you’re New York’s best at dissolving mate bonds. Our future is in your hands.”

I smiled and nodded. “Don’t worry.”

As soon as she left, I called my partner, Owen Grant.

“Owen, I need our top private investigator and forensic accountant. Right now! I want Nathan’s financial transactions and travel records from the last two years.”

“Oh, and tell my uncle, the fund Nathan manages? It’s time to pull out our investments.”

“I wanna see if he can survive without me.”

Owen was my golden partner for one simple reason—his efficiency was unmatched.

A few hours later, a 256GB encrypted hard drive was on my desk.

“Everything you wanted is in there.”

I plugged it in and clicked open.

The first video: On a private yacht, Nathan, wearing a white linen shirt, gentlemanly put a Graff diamond necklace around Amelia’s neck.

On my birthday last month, Nathan said he had an urgent meeting at work. When he came home, he only brought me a wilting carnation he bought from the street.

The second video: At a department store, Nathan had his arm around Amelia’s waist, and they were casually strolling through a luxury boutique.

Clothes, handbags, shoes—shopping bags piled up around Amelia’s feet. Their intimacy was almost palpable through the screen.

At checkout, the clerk gave them a music box as a free gift. He handed it to Marcus later, telling him, “This is something Daddy picked out for you.”

I closed the folder without expression and opened the next one.

Nathan’s offshore accounts showed several large transfers, all labeled as “investment consulting fees”. All funds ultimately went into an account ending in 3308.

Account holder: Amelia Ross.

Such a clumsy attempt to hide assets. Did he really think I’d never find out?

The final file made my blood run cold, which was a chat record from Marcus’s kindergarten teacher.

Amelia had been posing as “Marcus’s aunt,” constantly inquiring about his daily routine. She had even replied to the invitation for the parent-teacher meeting next week!

My hand tightened around the mouse.

I couldn’t accept this. Nathan’s betrayal had already quietly seeped into our son’s life.

When Marcus was born, Nathan awkwardly cradled the tiny life in his arms, vowing to cherish him forever.

Just moments ago, when Amelia said she wanted custody of the pup, I still held onto a sliver of hope, believing that at least Nathan loved our son, that even if we dissolved the mate bond, at least he wouldn’t hurt him.

I was wrong.

Chapter 3

My chest felt like it had been carved open with a silver knife, a vast gash letting frigid winds howl through.

My wolf whimpered in pain. I couldn’t take it anymore. I grabbed my phone, preparing to warn Nathan to stay away from my son.

But my phone buzzed first—it was a message from Amelia.

She sent me a photo of herself, asking for my opinion.

[Ms. Brooks, what do you think of this outfit? Nathan is taking me and Marcus to meet his parents tonight. I’m so nervous.]

Almost at the same time, Nathan’s message came through:

[Baby, Mom and Dad miss Marcus. I’m taking him to the Blackveil estate tonight. You’ve been working so hard lately, so I’ve booked you a spa treatment at the Hopston Hotel. Go relax a bit.]

Looking at the innocent face of my son in the photo, I smiled faintly.

A spa? That was nothing compared to this family dinner show.

Since it was meeting the parents, of course the real mate should be there to oversee. I hung up the phone and immediately drove straight to Blackveil Pack.

Along the way, Nathan’s messages kept popping up. [Baby, have you arrived yet? The main road’s blocked. Is everything okay?] He was tracking my location.

I calmly searched for a random photo of a spa center online and sent it to him.

[Just arrived. It’s a nice place.] My reply was short, but he seemed satisfied.

[Enjoy yourself. Love you.] Same old sweet talk. It made me sick now.

I put my phone in my pocket, ignoring the rest of his messages.

When I got there, I parked the car, put on my sunglasses, and slipped in through the side door. Dinner hadn’t started yet, but most of the relatives from Blackveil Pack had arrived.

Nathan’s mother, Stephanie, was bustling between the kitchen and the living room, her smile never fading. That warm, caring vibe was just like how she’d shown me years ago.

Back then, when I was exhausted weekly, she’d bring me warm soup at my office. When I was cold, she’d knit me scarves and slippers, taking better care of me than her own son. She even remembered my father’s back pain and arranged for a masseur to help relieve that.

My father, who was discerning, once told me, “Nathan’s parents seem great. I’m not worrying about you marrying into Blackveil Pack now.”

Now, when Amelia and Nathan walked in, she was the first to greet them.

“You must be Amelia! So pretty! I bet you’ll bring more lovely pups to our family.”

“Nathan, if you dare mistreat this girl…”

Nathan’s father, Edward, who was usually reserved, set down his coffee and patted Nathan’s shoulder contently.

“Nathan, you’ve got great taste. We could finally have more boys in this family.”

Suddenly, it hit me, so they were mad at me just because I had only given them one pup. How ironic, it was Nathan who refused to have more pups.

Amelia straightened proudly, her voice sweet as honey. “Don’t worry, Edward, Stephanie. Nathan took me to get checked. The healer says I’ll probably have a boy.”

“That’s wonderful! Truly wonderful!” His parents beamed, while my son stood alone in the corner, forgotten.

Relatives gathered around, showering her with praise.

My cousin, who I loaned $150,000? “Nathan, you’re a legend!”

The aunt whose son I got into a study abroad program? In tears. “Amelia’s such a sweetheart!”

The cousin I saved from his failed business venture? Raising a glass. “To this happy couple!”

Each one of them had benefitted from my help. Now, not one of them remembered my name.

My aunt wiped away her tears, then excitedly grabbed my four-year-old son and pushed him toward Amelia. “Go on, call her mom!”

Stephanie chimed in at once, pulling Marcus’s hand into Amelia’s. “Marcus. Call her mom!”

Marcus staggered back in fear. “No! She’s not my mom! My mom is Natalie!”

Stephanie’s face twisted with anger as she pinched his arm hard. “Stop saying that! This is your new mom!”

Edward glared at him coldly. “Nathan, is this how you raise your son? No manners whatsoever!”

Amelia pouted, snuggling closer to Nathan. “Nathan… does Marcus hate me?”

Nathan tightened his hold on her, his voice soothing and gentle.

“Of course not. He’s just a pup. He doesn’t know better. Once we’ve bonded, all the discipline is up to you. I won’t interfere.”

I stood outside the room, watching this absurd scene unfold. Finally, I couldn’t stand it any longer.

So I pushed the door open. Everyone’s expression froze as I smiled blandly, “Family dinner? Funny. How come no one told me?”",1,1763482055.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False
1p0fw2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingOverSixty/comments/1p0fw2g/after_3_months_saw_red_flags/,"After 3 months, saw red flags….","I’m 63(F)and very active. In early August I met a 76yr old man that I believed was the one I’d been searching for on dating apps for 8yrs. We clicked immediately; he was well dressed and had a great sense of humor. Our differences were few, but I put thinking of them aside. He had textbook knowledge of sports stats and trivia, and I believed opposites attract. 
Our first 10 dates were great; he brought me to fabulous restaurants and said he wanted to please me any way he could. Six weeks after dating we went on our first overnight and had a great time. When we returned, however, there was something different about our relationship and I couldn’t put my finger on it. He began to dress really casually, and some of his clothes were stained, but the worst was when he started criticizing people around him for not being able to choose from a menu at a coffee shop and at strangers who didn’t drive through intersections like the New Yorkers he was accustomed to. I surprised him by saying yes when he asked me to go to a college basketball game, then he asserted that my enthusiasm for the game wasn’t authentic. He casually asked me to see the new Springsteen movie with him, but told me I could watch another movie at the same time in the complex if I wasn’t a huge fan (some date, eh?). I asked him if he wanted to go to a concert a week after I had surgery, but he didn’t answer. I said the tickets weren’t expensive so I wouldn’t mind if I wasn’t feeling well and could cancel. To that he said, “so I’ll go with your mother?” We did take my 93 yr old mom to a classical music concert a month earlier, but I hadn’t mentioned including her, nor would I. He was beginning to sound snarky and obnoxious whenever we spoke, and I fumbled when I tried to explain that I was uneasy about the direction our relationship. He complained non-stop about his late wife’s family, and it got so I didn’t want to even hear his voice.  I ended the relationship through texts and an email, which his ego had trouble with. Before long I blocked him. I never told him exactly what bothered me the most about him; he was not fit as he professed to be, he didn’t exercise, and was 13 years my senior, which made him seem like an old man, and he had ate a lot of fast food.  (I know plenty of men in their early 80s who could run circles around him and eat well). Was this information something I could or should have shared with him? He can’t control his age, but the rest of the stuff? I’m hoping to hear what other women might do in my circumstance. ",4,1763482032.0,DatingOverSixty,3,1.0,False

My wife is starting a small food truck/vendor business. As of now she is only running a water boiler for hot drinks (think large coffee pot) and some lights. 

I have a 2000w inverter generator I use for camping and thought it would be enough. At the first event I learned it had no problem running her setup (never tripped a breaker and it seemed to heat the water quickly) but I noticed I used the 1 gallon of gas very quickly (about 1.5 hours). When I have been camping the same gallon lasts days. 

I am assuming the rate of consumption was due to the constant heavy draw of the water boiler. 

She will be upgrading to a trailer very soon that will have the boiler, lights, and AC for the summer. I’d also like to have some extra power as well for simple things (phone chargers, a radio, etc). MAYBE a small refrigerator down the road. 

I honestly have no idea how big I need to go. I am think I will need to keep the small generator for camping and get a larger one for her trailer but can you give me a rough idea how many watts I need? 

I know without specific draws it’s impossible to know exactly but a ballpark is fine so I can start getting a rough budget for the trailer build out costs. ",1,1763481958.0,Generator,1,1.0,False

I was so happy when I was able to get out of bed. Got all set up to get ready, obv watching the clock knowing my time was limited. 

Did I get ready? No. I couldn’t *possibly* get ready with a dirty counter top and sink.

The same dirty countertop and sink I’ve been meaning to clean for 2 weeks but haven’t brought myself to do. But today was THE day I guess. 

Now, why stop there?! If I’m doing the sink may as well do the toilet. 

Now it’s been 20 mins of me getting up I now have 40 mins (if I’m lucky) to get ready and enjoy my quiet time.

So cut to me, hair up, face ready to be washed, elbow deep in my toilet. I realized what I was doing.. stopped, laughed at myself and just shook my head.

1p0fsex,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1p0fsex/gf_became_ice_cold_after_a_trauma/,Gf became ice cold after a trauma,"Hello everyone ! 

Some context: been with my gf for 3 months, long distance (I’m in Luxembourg she’s in Budapest). Everything was going well, she was making plans to move in with me, we see each other every week or 2 weeks (she’s usually coming to mine). She was always adorable and supportive, texting a lot. What must be known is that she was raped when she was younger, sometimes she goes hot and cold but normally always goes back to normal. 
We’re supposed to meet in 3 days (she’s coming to mine) and have been texting over the weekend a lot, she was very sweet and told me she couldn’t wait to be with me. Yesterday evening she told me sth bad: a teacher of hers in uni invited her and some other girls to coffee and touched her inappropiately. She told me she freezes in such situations because of her traumas: she managed to leave but was feeling terrible. 
I told her I was there for her, was supportive and also told her I would like to discuss this in person because I didn’t want to be improper or give unsolicited advice. Basically tried to be the most supportive while not being too much. She grew very cold and told me 2 hrs after to “just forget about this whole thing please”

Today I noticed I couldn’t find her Insta account anymore (it already happened she deleted her account) and she wasn’t messaging me at all. I called her and she was ICE COLD. Felt I was bothering her so much, told me she was studying and at the train station. Asked her if I could help, no answer, asked her if everything was ok, just a cold yes. She even was kinda angry when I told her again it’s okay to ask for help. I told her a good news about my work, with which she was usually very supportive, she couldn’t care less. 

What do I do ? What did I do wrong ? I’m panicking at the moment because I love her so much and want to be there for her… i don’t want to ask her if everything’s ok between us but I am sooo stressed.
Should I ask her to avoid overthinking? Should I wait ? ",3,1763481816.0,LongDistance,1,1.0,False

**Schtick Shift: A Field Guide to the Theatrical World of Classical Piano Performance**

Imagine this: It is around 1985 and the venerable Sir Georg Solti takes the podium at Chicago’s Orchestra Hall to conduct Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2. The orchestra is poised, the audience breathless.

But then a stagehand rushes over and hands him a note. “Maestro, Daniel Barenboim can’t make it. But we’ve found someone just as good.” From the wings emerges a female pianist in a glittering gown, all curves and charisma, like a cross between a Bond heroine and a Las Vegas headliner.

Solti does a double take. Then he explodes: “Barenboim never looked like that! I’d take Chico Ciccolini (the Marx Brother) before I’d let a rhinestone siren from Studio 54 murder Rachmaninoff!”

Several violinists restrain Solti, and assure him that the pianist is, in fact, a conservatory-trained virtuoso, while he is gesticulating wildly at the avalanche of curviness occupying his stage. Unfazed, the pianist steps up to the bench. “Awww honey, what’s the big deal,” she says with a wink at Solti. She adjusts her neckline, to make it lower, then bends deeply to greet the audience. A few gasps. One cough. And then, without missing a beat, she launches into the first cadenza.

OK, that never happened. But I needed a story to illustrate how classical music performance has changed from the era of the venerable Solti to the present day (and who knows, maybe in this scenario Solti wouldn’t have blinked at a disco queen taking the stage with him instead of Barenboim). But these days, more than back then, it seems as if to make it as a concert pianist, it helps to have some kind of schtick. If it’s not ultra sexy clothing, it’s mysticism, melodrama, couture or choreographed flailing.

The days when someone could win a Van Cliburn competition and go on to play with the Concertgebouw Orchestra purely on interpretive depth and technical skill feels like something from the far past.

So here is your field guide to the different types of pianistic schtick that predominate on the venerable concert stages around the world. Let’s applaud this added creativity that performers bring to the stage to reward contemporary classical music lovers. You may not have heard of some (or all) of these remarkable performers, so this is your opportunity to learn independently about anyone who seems interesting to you.

I love and value each one of them and there is no mockery involved as they all possess amazing skills and insight honed over many years of rigorous practice.

**Femme Fatale Virtuoso**  
Combines dazzling technique with a magnetic stage presence. May have crafted a public persona that includes provocative, often revealing concert wear. Her public persona evokes glamour, mystery and danger.  
*Example:* **Yuja Wang,** undeniably in a class of her own, once famed for her provocative concert wear, she’s now leaning into a more refined elegance. Her wardrobe may have been a subplot, but her artistry has always been the headline.

**The Drama Queen Prophet**  
Haunted eyes, dramatic wrist flicks, 100-yard stares during rests.  
*Example:* **Daniil Trifonov**, where Liszt meets late-stage Dostoevsky. Trifonov! The man plays like he’s channeling Rachmaninoff and surviving a personal apocalypse at the same time. He’s part virtuoso, part mystic, part Victorian séance. It works.

**The Monk-in-Exile**  
Wears simple black, plays with stoic austerity, won't make eye contact with the audience, has renounced worldly distractions for the purity of his vocation.  
*Example:* **Grigory Sokolov**, the man doesn’t just play Bach; he *becomes* Bach, then refuses to acknowledge applause, as if the very concept of ego is beneath him.

**The Techno-Precision Engineer**  
Plays flawlessly, precision so exact it could calibrate a satellite; like using a Steinway to solve math problems.  
*Example:* **Marc-André Hamelin**, his fingers move at quantum physics speeds, his face, meanwhile, maintains the passionate range of a Swiss watch.

**The Quirky Genius**  
Awkward, endearing, possibly disheveled, but secretly brilliant.  
*Example:* **Ivo Pogorelić**, the man once got booed at the Chopin Competition and still walked away a legend. His interpretations channel ecstatic fervor, sometimes transcendent, sometimes chaotic, always unforgettable.

**The Sentimental Hero**  
Really likes choosing Chopin, wrings every drop of romanticism from every rubato.  
*Example:* **Lang Lang** (in his early years), every note is a feeling, every pause a moment, every crescendo a tragedy. If Chopin had written a soundtrack for a Steven Spielberg film, Lang Lang would be its ideal interpreter.

**The Historical Reenactor**  
Prefers clarity and restraint, champions fidelity to the composer’s intent, and sometimes sounds as if he’s channeling an 18^(th) century court musician, poised, articulate and true.  
*Example:* **András Schiff**, when he plays Mozart, you half-expect him to demand the audience wear powdered wigs and address him as *Hofkapellmeister*.

**The Social Justice Interpreter**  
Brings cultural and political framing to every program.  
*Example:* **Igor Levit**, whether he’s playing Beethoven or Shostakovich, you’re getting a TED Talk on democracy, fascism and the moral duty of art. (And honestly? We need more of this.)

**The Fiery Virtuoso**

Plays like a force of nature, part tempest, part wildfire.  
*Example:* **Hélène Grimaud**, her performances surge with emotional intensity and unpredictable energy, leaving audiences dazzled. When the spirit moves her, she is transcendent and at times she plays with such ferocity you wonder whether the piano owes her money.  
  
**The Incandescent Maverick**  
Doesn’t fit any category, transcends them all.  
*Example:* **David Tudor** *(1926–1996),* who premiered pieces involving humming, toy pianos and interpretive shadow puppetry. Critics called him either “avant-garde” or “a prankster.”

*Vilantia Prime, House of Mental Warmth*

For the first time, all of Aa'Lafione's wives were experiencing the sterile atmosphere and unkind medicinal under-scents of the House of Warmth that contrasted deeply with the warm fields and gentle winds outside. All of the debates and arguments of the past weeks had concluded without a clear result, but *something* needed to be done for the Clan to continue. Being stewarded by commoners stung deeply, even though one of the commoners was Minister of Culture. There was little doubt that something needed to be done. They all could agree on one thing - this seemed to be the plan that the Freelord would have chosen.

For Aa'Lafione himself, the past few days had been spent drowsing. He couldn't focus on the challenge, which was problematic. It seemed as if thoughts came and went with the scent of fog, and he would only regain himself for fleeting moments. It was a concern, but it was a concern he could overcome. He knew the words to speak, the words that would bring the Arbiters and by extension the False Lord and his daughter to the right path. After that, his daughter would marry appropriately and rapidly, and the child would be presented to the Throne; then the next portion - intertwining his line and the Throne, assuring that Greatclan Aa'Lafione would remain a beacon of the Clan Way even in these times, and indeed for all time. And with the mercenary force as his own sworn fist, there would be none to gainsay him - perhaps even the Throne themselves would begin looking to him for counsel.

As he sat comfortably in his chair, these thoughts preoccupied him so much that he didn't notice that all of his wives were in his study. He frowned at the glistening eyes with a scent of sorrow underlying their initial joy.

""I had given orders to be undisturbed. Yet my wives come to me - ah, you wish to give your champion laurels before battle."" His smile was confident and assured, the future laid out before him clearly.

Raloni's voice was soft as she spoke. ""We wish for you to see something. It is not a comfortable thing, but it is a thing you must see.""

There was a calm wave. ""What manner of discomfort will there be - I will lay my head at the hearth of victory, and you will all share this triumph. Show it, if you must.""

The wives gathered around him, each in their own place with an arm about him in some way. Their collective scent was comforting in a way. He would show his wives that there was no challenge he could not overcome, starting with whatever awaited on the holo.

The holo sprang to life, showing Vilantianic Stadium and the great roaring crowd there - Aa'Lafione inwardly congratulated himself on choosing such a place steeped in history and import; the nobles, thousands of his sworn and indebted were in the lower bowls where their scent and voice would carry to convince the Arbiters that whatever their hearts felt they would heed the call of the Greatlord, and avail themselves of his boons when he chose to grant them.

Then he saw himself. It was confusing and he looked to each of his wives who sat expressionless. ""This - trickery?""

Raloni voice was a thick rumble. ""No, my love. Witness the event with your heart.""

When Gryzzk arrived with his purple-clad charlatans, there was a sharp warning of some sort - beyond the ill colors was something dark lurking there, unseen and scentless but there nonetheless. Even as the Freelord placed his stolen weapon down, claiming another glory that was not his to claim, there was unease deep within.

The challenge began, with the holographic image giving his words and thoughts as if he'd crafted them himself - even the parts he'd been completely alone for. This was no trickery, it was a recording - a recording of events he didn't remember. Still he was pleased to have delivered the words as well as he had, and the alarms stilled for a moment.

As the challenge continued, the alarms in his mind began anew, sounding an ancient bell as the Freelord spoke words from a tablet. Words he had never heard, but recognized as the style of the Eleventh Lord A'Shanyu. He shook his head, tried to move his limbs but found that his wives held him in a grip of iron, forcing him to watch as three Arbiters found the words pleasant and the scent truer than his.

It continued - he willed his holo-self to speak properly of Leadership, of the price it took to be a leader. It was one of the most excellent speeches he had ever made, and the gnawing unease abated again only for it to return redoubled as Gryzzk pointed at his band of miscreants and spoke a single word to them.

Aa'Lafione recognized this, finally - it was a trap, a farce, something made to bring him low, anything but - but what it was. He took a shuddering breath, his mind reeling with the sorrow and shame from his wives. He had to do something against this, he had to get out. He had to fight; the challenge was lost and all he could do now was...

...nothing. He watched as he took up his own clan-weapon in a desperate bid to make the Freelord's win the most costly one of his life, but even that was denied as he was disarmed and then left to live. Aa'Lafione's world went grey as inconceivable reality shouldered aside this comfortable dream, and then the room went dark.

When he blinked, he saw by the sun that time had passed. But he remembered. He realized where he was, speaking words that seemed to come from another mouth, but he recognized his voice as he spoke to his wives.

""The Clan Way. The Way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and the dead keep it. Is there a path to honor that remains..."" Aa'Lafione's voice went quiet as he spoke. ""I...I wish to know what I have missed.""

There was a fractional nod of sorts shared between his wives, their grip relaxing as the Greatlord looked around finally, a thousand questions in his mind.

*Homeplate*

Gryzzk glanced at the clock and groaned softly. It seemed that morning had arrived and was quite determined to make him shift from a lovely bed with lovely wives to father and leader of an expanding Legion. He slid from his place and checked on the twins as they performed the miracle of sleeping in before he dressed in his uniform and went to make breakfast.

As he set his morning breakfast in place, he tapped his tablet for a channel. ""Rosie - executive summary regarding the Pavonians. First question - are they gendered, and if so advise regarding defining characteristics.""

Rosie's voice came over the tablet. ""Good news is, we don't need a lot of environmental changes; Pavonia's at one-point-two standard G. As far as figuring out which ones stand up to take a whiz, physically the men have bigger throat pouches and socially Pavonian society is matriarchal and very much driven by caste. Not as bad as y'all's, but the avenues for social advancement are limited. For your personal knowledge, Mulish is a guy and Glorious Second Philon is in fact going to the gal's room.""

""Hrm. Advise the company we will be forming after the lunch hour for formal introductions."" Gryzzk finished his breakfast and settled in with his tea. ""What rank does Mulish hold?""

""Maintenance Technician, Second Class. Awards and commendations as follows: three years long service, six years long service, nine years long service, and twelve years long service."" Rosie paused. ""Someone sent him a hospital pass with this gig.""

""I presume Glorious Second Philon has a lengthier list of awards?""

Rosie's snort was answer enough, but the scroll across Gryzzk's tablet expanded on the tale. ""The shorter list is the one she hasn't been awarded - specifically the Pavonian Shining Soul of Glorious Victory, which is only awarded posthumously. As far as her ship rank and duty structure goes, she's the Tactical Officer and third in command."" There was a moment before she continued. ""Mulish's duties appear to consist of cleaning the scales and toejam from the plumbing.""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""Presumably they have different orders. See if we can discretely find out what those orders are and guide them appropriately. Send them an invitation for dinner at my quarters tonight.""

""Ah, yeah about that."" Rosie seemed to pause for a moment. ""Check your message bin for one from Lomeia. Dinner invitation for tonight; 'Freelord, your presence is required at the evening hour to partake in a meal at the hearth of our love - I pass along orders from a direct representative of One Who Sits the Dawn Throne; attendance by self and wives most mandatory, informal dress. Keep these words close to your soul.' That's definitely odd.""

Gryzzk blinked and thought. And shook his head. ""No, can't be that.""

""Okay I'm passing the hat, buy me a clue.""

""The phrasing. A direct representative of the Throne would be one of the Throne-Consorts or a Minister - and the phrasing is such that his is not to be made public. By anyone - including you, XO."" Gryzzk swallowed a larger-than-expected amount of tea to calm himself, which resulted in a brief pain along his throat. ""Reply precisely as follows: The Freelord accepts but prays the light gods deliver a wash of enlightenment to his twilight-ridden soul.""

Gryzzk's wives padded out to the kitchen, blinking away the sleep as they each carried one of the twins and began their day. It was amusing on one level to see their differences - Grezzk was in a house robe of a deep purple, and could almost have stepped out for shopping with only a moment to select the shoes. Kiole was a wreck, wearing a T-shirt of some Hurdop band along with half-shorts that appeared to have been uniform pants in a previous life. They both moved to nuzzle one side of Gryzzk's face before they took their own breakfast to the table.

""My handsome hand is troubled."" Grezzk's statement was somewhat detached, as she was still marshalling her faculties for the day.

""Only somewhat - there seem to be wheels in motion that involve all of us, as well as the Lomeia triad.""

Kiole frowned. ""Is there another noble from one of our homeworlds requiring education?"" She stood, beginning to move to the bedroom. ""I put my pistol in the headboard...""

There was a headshake. ""No this does not seem to require weapons, Lady Warrior.""

A soft hmph was his reply. ""So you say now.""

""It is an invitation to dinner, formal wording but informal dress.""

""I'll bring my informal sidearm."" Kiole's voice indicated that the subject was not a debatable one.

""Very well. Concealable please.""

Grezzk looked a tad uncomfortable as she spoke. ""If it is prudent to carry weapons, perhaps we could utilize the twins' carrier.""

There was a nod from Kiole. ""Just in case, yes."" She looked at Gryzzk. ""Don't worry. We'll only bring stunners.""

Further discussion was interrupted by a knock. Gryzzk flicked his eyes to the door to see that it was O'Brien, dressed in most of her formal uniform and showing no ill effects from the previous night.

""Sergeant Major, come in.""

As O'Brien entered, the daughters burst from their room to sit upon O'Brien's feet, shouting joy at Auntie O'Brien's arrival. The Sergeant Major was unapologetic. ""I heard Dublin Coddle for lunch. I didn't want to chance it. Already had breakfast.""

Grezzk nuzzled her husband briefly. ""You have wise sworn, handsome hand."" She moved to get a cup of coffee for the Sergeant Major.

O'Brien settled on the couch as everyone began repositioning for the day. ""I assume Edwards wants to go to OCS and learn to be a fool?""

""She expressed this desire to me last night. However, she did mention that both our approvals are required.""

There was a bare shrug. ""She'll make a fine lieutenant. The only thing that's ever held her back was her parents. Career non-coms both, fine leaders - and as per tradition, death on the brass.""

Gryzzk lifted an eyebrow. ""Does that include me?""

There was a soft snort. ""Major, I am reminded of a wise Terran saying; 'Ignorance is bliss.' You may safely assume that every decision you've made has rubbed one of your enlisted the wrong way at some point. If you're smart, you'll ask later to learn.""

Gryzzk demurred. ""Understood. Now, the rest of today. Advise the company there will be afternoon formation in order to introduce our Pavonian guests and lay out the course for the expansion. We'll need work crews for the quarters and permanent ship berths."" Gryzzk paused. ""If there is to be further expansion of the Legion, we may wish to investigate the possibility of acquiring our own base. For now, I should very like your input regarding the officers of our companies...""

The conversation continued in that vein until precisely ten, when the entry chime signaled. Gryzzk and O'Brien threw on their formal jackets and stood for a long moment before Gryzzk acknowledged the chime. ""Enter.""

Edwards arrived in full formal uniform. Her movements were stiff, and the children seemed to note the gravity of the moment as Edwards presented her tablet to O'Brien first before standing rigid.

""Sergeant Brelyna Edwards requesting permission to detach for Officer Candidate School, Sergeant Major.""

O'Brien's voice was measured as her eyes swept over the tablet. ""Your files are in order. Sergeant, you have my approval."" There was a pause. ""Fuck this up and you'll be scrubbing every piece of hardware in Recon with a pin."" The tablet was duly placed back in Edwards' hand.

""Hooah, Sergeant Major."" Edwards gave a quarter-twist before moving precisely to stand in front of Gryzzk. ""Permission to detach, Major.""

Gryzzk looked over the tablet calmly; while this was for show, this was a show that held a measure of importance. He looked over Edwards' full record slowly before he nodded gravely.

""Sergeant, permission is granted. Today you will attend all company functions. Tomorrow at zero-eight-hundred you will report to the Commandant as an officer candidate for further instruction."" Gryzzk tapped his approval before handing the tablet back. ""We will await your return, Candidate.""

There was a wash of relief from Edwards as she left. O'Brien promptly ditched her uniform blouse, smiling softly. ""If she doesn't graduate in the top three I'll buy her a round at Sparrow's.""

""And if she does?""

""I'll buy two rounds.""

The rest of the morning was dedicated to the logistics of expansion as the scents of cooking suffused the atmosphere - the four functioning ships were designated as temporary living quarters for the incoming company members pending completion of their actual living space, with other appropriate spaces being created. The ship that was being cobbled together by the engineering teams was designated as a supply depot.

""XO, our complement is supposed to be expanding to six companies total, correct?""

""Correct, Freelord.""

Gryzzk considered for a moment. ""I would like to have a seventh ship - the final ship would be specifically for training purposes. We could test new doctrines and educate new recruits who may be unused to operating with other species. We would consider it an investment.""

""Makes sense to me - so for the training ship, we've got options. There's a Terran Self-Defense Navy frigate that's being decomm'ed for option one, and then option two is we've got a couple more shitboxes from Hurdop and Vilantia we could bash together.""

Gryzzk paused. ""What about all three? Use the Terran frigate as the superstructure, and then take what we can utilize from the homeworld ships. I'd like to prepare for the possibility that it may be pressed into active service at a later date.""

""More spendy but doable. We'd have to have everybody on contract five minutes after they were commissioned.""

""I believe that was the initial plan, XO.""

""Yeah, but now instead of figurative, it's literal.""

""As I recall, our next Legion contract was for a Third Contact mission. Advise our employers that the full Legion will be attending and confirm appropriate compensation will be delivered to our account.""

O'Brien's eyebrow went up fractionally. ""Major?""

""Yes Sergeant Major?""

""That is dirty. Next time we make a grocery run to Terra for drygoods, could you come to warehouse and haggle down the price?""

There was a soft chuckle. ""Perhaps. The war taught us all a variety of skills. In any event, we have guests arriving shortly - the Pavonians will be here after the lunch for an initial briefing.""

Lunch itself was a quiet affair, with everyone marveling at Gryzzk's skill in blending spices from three worlds. Finally after her third bowl, O'Brien pushed herself back from the table.

""I need a nap or a beer. If you don't send the recipe home with me miss Grezzk, Colm'll take it as grounds for divorce - I don't think I've had a finer meal outside me own Mam's kitchen.""

There was a soft smile at the praise. ""Of course, Sergeant Major.""

The entire household was moving slowly after the meal - even Millennium, who had been brought to the table for his own lunch. It had been quite frankly a busy day and they was barely half over. Finally there was a chime, and the holo showed the two assigned Pavonians.

Gryzzk nodded slowly, ensuring his uniform was clean. ""Enter.""

The Pavonians seemed a bit reserved as they entered, taking stock of the room carefully as if analyzing every portion of it, their tongues flicking out here and there. Their clothing seemed more metallic - it almost appeared to be Pavonian combat armor save for the portions that appeared to be decorated with their service medals. After a lengthy look at O'Brien, Philon finally turned and addressed Gryzzk from behind Mulish.

""Freelord Major, before we begin I wish to make one fact perfectly clear - neither myself nor Mulish will fall to the pelvic sorceries of either you or your company.""

That wasn't expected at all, and Gryzzk shared a glance with both O'Brien and Kiole, who both appeared similarly dumbfounded. ""I'm afraid I am uncertain of the specifics you refer to.""

There was a haughty exhalation and a waggle of a three-fingered hand. ""Your executive officer was kind enough to provide a complete dossier with respect to all your lurid actions - quite voluminous. We have only reviewed as far as *Furry Fornicators of Planet Pheromone Volume Five*, but rest assured we will complete the series prior to tomorrow.""

Gryzzk took a deep breath. ""***ROSIE!*** Present yourself immediately!""",2,1763481641.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

-The was a little boy who only spoke Spanish and he wanted coffee with his breakfast but the foster parents wouldn’t let him have coffee and he started crying and the girl explained to them that it was normal in their culture to give kids coffee because what they gave them was mostly milk and sugar with a tiny bit of coffee.

I am born and raised in NYC, my grandparents and father all born and raised in PR, but moved and stayed in NYC. 

After going and visiting the island on my own, I’ve discovered that I want to stay. I find myself day dreaming about being there daily. This last trip I went on was really transformative for me and I say that because I recently lost my fiancée to a motorcycle accident and when I went to the island I felt so seen. I talked to locals and they shared their grief stories with me, not knowing mine at all, but it just felt so refreshing to actually talk about grief and not shove it down and pretend it’s not there.

I think I want to move to the island, but I have two dogs and I’m a single woman and I just want to know if I’m in lalala land for thinking I can do this move alone. I don’t know anyone that’s moved from NYC to PR. Only the other way around. 

My intention on moving is to heal parts of myself that I feel like I can’t do in the hustle and bustle of NYC. I enjoy drinking coffee, going to the beach, hiking, surfing, dancing, and I feel like I would really enjoy myself but again I’m on vacation I don’t know the hard parts of the island.

I told him next time he wants to fake a feud maybe give me a 10-second heads up.

We ended up fake-arguing about “workflow alignment” whenever someone walked by. It was atrocious acting. If anyone had listened closely we were mostly saying stuff like:

“Yeah well maybe your… spreadsheets… are too… aligned.”

I took your arm and we walked for 3kms talking about everything, you and I, two strangers.



I'll always remember our first coffee date. You accepting my invitation made me fold like a pretzel. Pronto was nice and the cream pumpkin soup was awesome, you loved it. I dropped you home that day and hugged you, you gave me a peck and I couldn't hide my smile. 



I'll always remember our first oral sex encounter, you had invited me over and made the tastiest pilau on Earth and in some parts of heaven. I was busy eating and busy salivating at those voluptuous thighs, you must have noticed my boner because you actually grabbed it and pushed it so far high up your mouth and sucked me dry like a vacuum cleaner.  I'll always remember how I pushed your black frock up and found you had nothing underneath, I proceeded to put my legs in between your legs and lick your labia in circular motions while slowly putting a finger or two in your pussy, I remember you tasted so good that I had to put my tongue in your pussy and ride it up and down, it will always be funny how that orgasm made you lose control and you farted on my face. We guffawed.



I'll always remember when your mum called me at night and told me that you had been stabbed. I was startled that I couldn't respond. I'll always remember that you died one day later.



I'm okay now, I'm glad people don't ask me why I stay indoors all day anymore, why my I don't trim my hair anymore. 



I'm okay now, I'm glad no one asks me why I quit my job to fully concentrate on our small farming business. 



I'm okay now, I'm glad you don't appear in my dreams anymore asking me ""where was I?""

So, I saw this girl at the coffee shop, looking like she was just minding her own business. I decided today was the day—time to make a move. I took a deep breath, walked up confidently, and said, “Hey, I couldn’t help but notice your smile. Mind if I get your number?”

Her eyes widened, she looked me up and down, then burst out laughing—turning her head away. I stood there, stunned. Turns out I mistook her for someone I saw on TV in a meme. She wasn’t even the girl I was talking about.

She looked at me, still chuckling, and said, “Sorry, buddy, I think you’ve got the wrong person,” before walking away.

Short story long: during my fast I overthought everything and kept looking for more info, but couldn't find much as most three week fasts are Daniel fasts, or people just don't talk about it much. I want to share how I prepped and came off, what I took during the fast, and how I felt generally as the days progressed. I need to caveat though, everyone is different, some people can't fast one day due to medical reasons, and I am extremely thankful to have even been able to fast the way I did. Experiences will differ.

Prep: going into the fast I did zero prep. Most I have fasted before was three days, and that was a while ago, so although I knew I could go more than one day that's about as far as that goes.

On fast diet: water, black coffee, black tea, creatine, unflavored electrolytes (only took for a few days then stopped), salty water the first week, and then I took baking soda one time. Oh and communion a couple times.

Days 1-5: these were extremely impactful days, hunger wise it peaked on about day two and stayed at that level till around day five to seven. I was definitely in my head a lot, but was still able to work out even with minimal losses in the gym.

Days 6-13: these were the hardest days. The hunger went away some to just an average amount of hunger like you'd feel in the morning without breakfast, but I was lightheaded every time I stood up, and had really bad acid reflux. Never threw up, but laying down in bed was rough. I had some baking soda on day 13 and that helped a little bit that night, and a couple days after the reflux mostly went away though it lingered the rest of the time. As stated earlier I put some salt in my water the first week, then day 10 I got actual electrolyte packets, but those really didn't help and I decided to completely cut that and the salt starting on day 14. Also stopped going to the gym.

Days 14-21: these were both easier and harder. I found myself obsessing over food and what I'd make and what I'd eat, and I think that made me waste a lot of valuable time with the Lord. I was able to think more clearly though, did just fine academically and my lightheadedness went away. I would fatigue and cramp a lot when doing things like guitar or just anything other than walking and stairs, but it was all manageable enough. Also this might be TMI but the entire time I had diarrhea every morning (completely normal, but surprising).

Weight loss, refeeding, and aftermath: I started at a bit over 200 pounds, not fat but definitely pushing pudgy. I lost just over 30 pounds by the end of the fast. Refeeding I honestly thought the things I read online were a bit overdramatic, and in my experience that was proven correct. I had some chicken broth the night I broke my fast and for breakfast the next day. A couple hours later I had an apple, then a couple hours later I had some avocado and soft boiled eggs. For dinner I had sushi. The next day I had a parfait for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch, and pizza for dinner. So really only a day and a meal of careful refeeding. Didn't have any bowl issues from it either. The next few days I gained about 15 pounds and then my weight stabilized, and through just a bit of consciously healthy eating I've kept it there for the past month.

Like I said in the beginning, everyone's different so what you may be able to fast, how you feel during it, and how you come off of it all might be different. However, I hope this post can encourage some of you that even with zero preparation you are in fact capable of doing it. It's hard, but my walk with God grew so much closer during the time and though that spiritual high has gone away some I still have lasting impacts.

1p0fjci,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalpiano/comments/1p0fjci/schtick_shift_a_field_guide_to_the_theatrical/,Schtick Shift: A Field Guide to the Theatrical World of Classical Piano Performance,"**Note: I submitted this to a number of classical music magazines and satire magazines and it was rejected by all of them as they either said it was too ""niche"" or not respectful enough. I disagree. So I am just offering it here for your enjoyment on Reddit. I had a fun time writing it and I would be so pleased if you enjoyed it.** 



**Schtick Shift: A Field Guide to the Theatrical World of Classical Piano Performance**  


Imagine this: It is around 1985 and the venerable Sir Georg Solti takes the podium at Chicago’s Orchestra Hall to conduct Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2. The orchestra is poised, the audience breathless.

But then a stagehand rushes over and hands him a note. “Maestro, Daniel Barenboim can’t make it. But we’ve found someone just as good.” From the wings emerges a female pianist in a glittering gown, all curves and charisma, like a cross between a Bond heroine and a Las Vegas headliner.

Solti does a double take. Then he explodes: “Barenboim never looked like that! I’d take Chico Ciccolini (the Marx Brother) before I’d let a rhinestone siren from Studio 54 murder Rachmaninoff!”

Several violinists restrain Solti, and assure him that the pianist is, in fact, a conservatory-trained virtuoso, while he is gesticulating wildly at the avalanche of curviness occupying his stage. Unfazed, the pianist steps up to the bench. “Awww honey, what’s the big deal,” she says with a wink at Solti. She adjusts her neckline, to make it lower, then bends deeply to greet the audience. A few gasps. One cough. And then, without missing a beat, she launches into the first cadenza.

OK, that never happened. But I needed a story to illustrate how classical music performance has changed from the era of the venerable Solti to the present day (and who knows, maybe in this scenario Solti wouldn’t have blinked at a disco queen taking the stage with him instead of Barenboim). But these days, more than back then, it seems as if to make it as a concert pianist, it helps to have some kind of schtick. If it’s not ultra sexy clothing, it’s mysticism, melodrama, couture or choreographed flailing.

The days when someone could win a Van Cliburn competition and go on to play with the Concertgebouw Orchestra purely on interpretive depth and technical skill feels like something from the far past.

So here is your field guide to the different types of pianistic schtick that predominate on the venerable concert stages around the world. Let’s applaud this added creativity that performers bring to the stage to reward contemporary classical music lovers. You may not have heard of some (or all) of these remarkable performers, so this is your opportunity to learn independently about anyone who seems interesting to you.

I love and value each one of them and there is no mockery involved as they all possess amazing skills and insight honed over many years of rigorous practice.

**Femme Fatale Virtuoso**  
Combines dazzling technique with a magnetic stage presence. May have crafted a public persona that includes provocative, often revealing concert wear. Her public persona evokes glamour, mystery and danger.  
*Example:* **Yuja Wang,** undeniably in a class of her own, once famed for her provocative concert wear, she’s now leaning into a more refined elegance. Her wardrobe may have been a subplot, but her artistry has always been the headline.

**The Drama Queen Prophet**  
Haunted eyes, dramatic wrist flicks, 100-yard stares during rests.  
*Example:* **Daniil Trifonov**, where Liszt meets late-stage Dostoevsky. Trifonov! The man plays like he’s channeling Rachmaninoff and surviving a personal apocalypse at the same time. He’s part virtuoso, part mystic, part Victorian séance. It works.

**The Monk-in-Exile**  
Wears simple black, plays with stoic austerity, won't make eye contact with the audience, has renounced worldly distractions for the purity of his vocation.  
*Example:* **Grigory Sokolov**, the man doesn’t just play Bach; he *becomes* Bach, then refuses to acknowledge applause, as if the very concept of ego is beneath him.

**The Techno-Precision Engineer**  
Plays flawlessly, precision so exact it could calibrate a satellite; like using a Steinway to solve math problems.  
*Example:* **Marc-André Hamelin**, his fingers move at quantum physics speeds, his face, meanwhile, maintains the passionate range of a Swiss watch.

**The Quirky Genius**  
Awkward, endearing, possibly disheveled, but secretly brilliant.  
*Example:* **Ivo Pogorelić**, the man once got booed at the Chopin Competition and still walked away a legend. His interpretations channel ecstatic fervor, sometimes transcendent, sometimes chaotic, always unforgettable.

**The Sentimental Hero**  
Really likes choosing Chopin, wrings every drop of romanticism from every rubato.  
*Example:* **Lang Lang** (in his early years), every note is a feeling, every pause a moment, every crescendo a tragedy. If Chopin had written a soundtrack for a Steven Spielberg film, Lang Lang would be its ideal interpreter.

**The Historical Reenactor**  
Prefers clarity and restraint, champions fidelity to the composer’s intent, and sometimes sounds as if he’s channeling an 18^(th) century court musician, poised, articulate and true.  
*Example:* **András Schiff**, when he plays Mozart, you half-expect him to demand the audience wear powdered wigs and address him as *Hofkapellmeister*.

**The Social Justice Interpreter**  
Brings cultural and political framing to every program.  
*Example:* **Igor Levit**, whether he’s playing Beethoven or Shostakovich, you’re getting a TED Talk on democracy, fascism and the moral duty of art. (And honestly? We need more of this.)

**The Fiery Virtuoso**

Plays like a force of nature, part tempest, part wildfire.  
*Example:* **Hélène Grimaud**, her performances surge with emotional intensity and unpredictable energy, leaving audiences dazzled. When the spirit moves her, she is transcendent and at times she plays with such ferocity you wonder whether the piano owes her money.  
  
**The Incandescent Maverick**  
Doesn’t fit any category, transcends them all.  
*Example:* **David Tudor** *(1926–1996),* who premiered pieces involving humming, toy pianos and interpretive shadow puppetry. Critics called him either “avant-garde” or “a prankster.”

He texted me two weeks ago complimenting my outfit on a story, then asked me about my studies and stuff and offered to reach out if I needed. 

Then one time he just messaged me and said he forgot what he texted for(classic!). Then the other day he said he was about to disappear from socials and gave me his number but then deleted it after 2-3 hours saying he changed his mind. This made me thought he liked me maybe. We had a few conversations here and there he even showed trust in me with his money somehow which I called him out in a playful way that he has way too much trust on people online which he replied I know whom to trust. 

He then last Saturday asked me 'let's catch-up '. At this point I may have started liking him a lil bit so I also wanted to meet him. He's physically very fit and attractive to me and our spiritual beliefs align as well so yk i had this something in my mind that's why I put the being delusional part. I went on to meet him and we had a great time roaming around the museum. He also introduced me to his brother who happened to be there and the brother was teasing him that how was he at the museum all of a sudden(maybe he wasn't supposed to be there?!) and then he looked at me and gave him teasing glances so maybe something was cooking. He paid for coffee and kept asking if I wanted to have something. We talked about so many things, he also shared about his family and work stuff, his struggles, etc. reaching at the end he got a call from his female friend whom he said he can't come rn but they can arrange something later because he was with a friend rn(me) which was weird for some reason.

Thought I'd draw attention to a bit of dry humor that some might have missed.  This conversation occurred in volume 6 between girl's track team captain Kurata and Nukumizu in a coffee shop. Kurata's initial plan was to try to honey trap Nukkun, hoping that evidence of his infidelity will cause Lemon to break up with him.  This is obviously because she's heard about his bad reputation as a philanderer. When this trap fails, the entire girls track team, also undercover in the coffee shop, stand up, bow and beg him to break up with Lemon. This he also won't do, since he is not her boyfriend. Eventually they start talking a bit more honestly and at one point Kurata says:

>""You were at Tsuwabuki Fest for Remon, right?""

>Tsuwabuki Fest- right, a classmate from middle school had tried to approach Yakishio and was utterly rejected.

>""**Yeah, I did go to see the track team.**""

>""She's popular, you know. Despite appearances, she's careful about how she interacts with boys.""

>Huh, being popular is really tough.

>“That’s why I got curious when I saw how different her attitude is to you compared to other boys.”

>Does she mean I’m not really a guy in her eyes…?

>**""But the track team doesn't have a rule against dating, right? No need to worry so much.""**

>“Remon’s the type to be ruined by guys, don’t you think?”

>“That’s imposs-”

>...Well, actually, it might be.

>Given how she reacts around Ayano, who isn't even her boyfriend, having an actual boyfriend could indeed be a problem…

>**""Indeed, Yakishio does seem like she could fall for the wrong type of guy. Yeah, I need to be careful.""**

>**""...Yeah, you really do need to be careful.""**

>**Kurata-san stared at me intently for some reason.**

I found this hilarious because Nukumizu clearly doesn't understand how other people see him. Think about it.  Lemon has her guard up with all other guys except for Nukkun.  The only possible ""wrong type of guy"" that Lemon could fall for is therefore Nukkun himself.  Nukkun thinks her behavior around Ayano could be a problem, but he's completely blind to how she much lewder she gets around Nukkun himself.

She's also mistaken about Lemon's nature.  Proof of Nukkun's infidelity wouldn't faze her. Lemon is an innocently lewd type, not real jealous.  She once even tried to share one of her sessions with Komari, who ran away.

Also Nukkun doesn't realize it but the tone of this conversation shows he has unconsciously assumed responsibility for watching over Lemon and protecting her.",2,1763481084.0,Makeine,0,1.0,False

# Trump cuts tariffs on coffee and bananas

In a rare move that actually lowers prices, the Trump administration announced Thursday it will eliminate tariffs on coffee, bananas, other food imports and select textile products from Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina.

**The details:** Coffee and bananas from Ecuador get tariff-free treatment, along with coffee, textiles and apparel from Guatemala. The broader tariff rates on these countries stay in place (10-15%), but specific food categories are getting relief.

Why now? Coffee prices have spiked 19% over the past year through September, while bananas jumped 7%. After Republicans got hammered in recent elections with voters citing high living costs, the administration is scrambling to show relief.

**The Brazil angle:** Americans buy nearly all their coffee from abroad, with 99% of the beans coming primarily from Brazil and Colombia. Brazil's sitting under a 50% tariff right now, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Brazil's Foreign Minister this week to discuss a framework trade agreement. If that deal closes, coffee prices could drop significantly.

**For logistics:** Expect import volume shifts as these framework deals finalize within two weeks. More deals with Central and South American nations, Switzerland, and Taiwan are reportedly in the works.

# Port operations stay calm, but 2026 could be chaos

November's data confirms a continued pattern of import and export volume decreases, according to ITS Logistics' monthly port rail/ramp freight index. Container operations at major ports are rated ""normal"" across the board right now.

**But here's the problem:** Trucking companies have been exiting the market at an accelerated rate as an extended freight recession has pummeled rates and raised operating costs, and a federal initiative to remove non-domiciled Commercial Drivers License (CDL) holders from service could create trucking capacity issues.

**The scary number:** As many as 600,000 drivers could be removed from the U.S. driver ecosystem due to non-domiciled driver and English language proficiency (ELP) enforcement.

November saw a ""significant spike"" in trucking activity on the Pacific Coast from October, likely due to shippers taking steps to replace actual and potential capacity at risk. Translation: Companies are already panic-booking capacity for 2026 before the driver shortage hits.

**Bottom line:** If you're a shipper or 3PL, lock in capacity now. What looks calm today could turn into a bloodbath next year.

# FedEx surprises everyone with optimistic forecast

FedEx Chief Financial Officer John Dietrich said the company expects its fiscal second-quarter profit to exceed the $4.05 per share it reported during the same period last year. Analysts weren't expecting that—and FedEx shares jumped over 5% in early trading.

**Why it matters:** The guidance surprised analysts who had anticipated slightly lower results, and investors interpreted the news as a signal that the worst-case scenarios for the holiday logistics season may not materialize.

**The complication:** A fatal UPS MD-11 freighter crash last week has triggered the temporary grounding of similar aircraft models. While the MD-11 accounts for only 4 percent of FedEx's fleet, it represents closer to 9 percent of UPS's air cargo capacity.

Both carriers are leaning on third-party charter providers to fill the gap, which is effective in the short term but comes at a price, with higher expenses expected to flow through to Q2 financials.

**Translation:** Peak season might not be the disaster everyone feared, but air freight capacity is tighter than expected, and costs are rising.

# USPS keeps bleeding money (but slower)

Fiscal year 2025 earnings for USPS saw operating revenue at $80.5 billion with a 1.2% annual gain, while its net loss under generally accepted accounting principles, at $9.0 billion, trailed the $9.5 billion fiscal 2024 net loss.

The silver lining? USPS said the improvement was related to a $916 million operating revenue increase, transportation expense reductions of $422 million, and a decrease in workers' compensation expense of $1.1 billion.

**The package problem:** Shipping and Packages revenue, at $32.580 billion, was up 1% annually, but volume dipped 5.7% annually. Priority Mail Services revenue fell 17.6% annually, with volume off 15.8%.

**The one winner:** USPS Ground Advantage saw revenues of $16.2 billion, for a 20.7% annual increase, with 2.930 million pieces delivered, for a 21.0% annual increase.

Postmaster General David Steiner said ""the occasional appearance of financial progress—such as our profitable first quarter—is far outweighed by the reality of our significant systemic annual revenue and cost imbalance"".

Brazil's sitting under a 50% tariff right now, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Brazil's Foreign Minister this week to discuss a framework trade agreement. If that deal closes, coffee prices could drop significantly.

**For logistics:** Expect import volume shifts as these framework deals finalize within two weeks. More deals with Central and South American nations, Switzerland, and Taiwan are reportedly in the works.

# Port operations stay calm, but 2026 could be chaos

November's data confirms a continued pattern of import and export volume decreases, according to ITS Logistics' monthly port rail/ramp freight index. Container operations at major ports are rated ""normal"" across the board right now.

**But here's the problem:** Trucking companies have been exiting the market at an accelerated rate as an extended freight recession has pummeled rates and raised operating costs, and a federal initiative to remove non-domiciled Commercial Drivers License (CDL) holders from service could create trucking capacity issues.

**The scary number:** As many as 600,000 drivers could be removed from the U.S. driver ecosystem due to non-domiciled driver and English language proficiency (ELP) enforcement.

November saw a ""significant spike"" in trucking activity on the Pacific Coast from October, likely due to shippers taking steps to replace actual and potential capacity at risk. Translation: Companies are already panic-booking capacity for 2026 before the driver shortage hits.

**Bottom line:** If you're a shipper or 3PL, lock in capacity now. What looks calm today could turn into a bloodbath next year.

# Make Inventory Donation As Easy As Ecomm Fulfillment

Meet Stock, the logistics platform helping operators and 3PLs transform excess and abandoned inventory into impact. Instead of paying to store, handle, or dispose of unsellable goods, operators can now easily route inventory to vetted nonprofits across the country, reducing waste, freeing up warehouse space, and creating measurable social good. 

Stock integrates directly with fulfillment workflows, so donation orders move just like any other shipment. Since launching, the platform has already facilitated over $13 million in donations to communities in need. For operators, it’s a seamless way to cut costs, serve clients better, and make a real difference.

# FedEx surprises everyone with optimistic forecast

FedEx Chief Financial Officer John Dietrich said the company expects its fiscal second-quarter profit to exceed the $4.05 per share it reported during the same period last year. Analysts weren't expecting that—and FedEx shares jumped over 5% in early trading.

**Why it matters:** The guidance surprised analysts who had anticipated slightly lower results, and investors interpreted the news as a signal that the worst-case scenarios for the holiday logistics season may not materialize.

**The complication:** A fatal UPS MD-11 freighter crash last week has triggered the temporary grounding of similar aircraft models. While the MD-11 accounts for only 4 percent of FedEx's fleet, it represents closer to 9 percent of UPS's air cargo capacity.

Both carriers are leaning on third-party charter providers to fill the gap, which is effective in the short term but comes at a price, with higher expenses expected to flow through to Q2 financials.

**Translation:** Peak season might not be the disaster everyone feared, but air freight capacity is tighter than expected, and costs are rising.

# USPS keeps bleeding money (but slower)

Fiscal year 2025 earnings for USPS saw operating revenue at $80.5 billion with a 1.2% annual gain, while its net loss under generally accepted accounting principles, at $9.0 billion, trailed the $9.5 billion fiscal 2024 net loss.

The silver lining? USPS said the improvement was related to a $916 million operating revenue increase, transportation expense reductions of $422 million, and a decrease in workers' compensation expense of $1.1 billion.

**The package problem:** Shipping and Packages revenue, at $32.580 billion, was up 1% annually, but volume dipped 5.7% annually. Priority Mail Services revenue fell 17.6% annually, with volume off 15.8%.

**The one winner:** USPS Ground Advantage saw revenues of $16.2 billion, for a 20.7% annual increase, with 2.930 million pieces delivered, for a 21.0% annual increase.

Postmaster General David Steiner said ""the occasional appearance of financial progress—such as our profitable first quarter—is far outweighed by the reality of our significant systemic annual revenue and cost imbalance"".

The most recent blow up was a series of events where she let her biological daughter take control of her life and force me into homelessness. I was living with my mom, and in less than a month after a health crisis, they (her daughter and granddaughter) sold her home. They tried to sell it sooner to give me even less time and ensure I was on the streets. They cut off contact between me and my mom. Y'all can call me an AH for partially blaming her in what happened as she was fully capable of making decisions for herself during that time. This is not about that. 

  
I have been living in my car in my aunt's yard for almost 2 months now. My older sister lives in the house with them, and one of her jobs is to go and take care of my mom (sister used to work in a nursing home) who lives with her bio daughter. About a month ago, my aunt and sister gave me a $100 bill and told me that some stranger paid for their groceries and to pay it forward. I questioned them because they were a bit inconsistent in their story (one said gas station, the other said grocery store), but I really did need the money. I accepted it, and it allowed me to buy my coffee maker to cook food as well as some warm fast food when the nights were too cold amongst other things. I was very grateful for it. 

  
I didn't think much of who it came from until last week when my mom called me when her daughter and SIL weren't home. I reflexively answered, and we caught up with each other. I hadn't spoken to her in 2 months. She cried hearing what I had gone through, and I cried hearing her cry. She told me she was the one who sent the $100, and she told my aunt and sister to lie so that I would accept the money. She also told me that she's essentially emotionally numb now to her formerly treasured possessions as her daughter refused to collect them before the sale of the house, including her entire closet of clothes. Apparently her daughter also hasn't held up to a lot of the promises she made in regards to caring for her mother, but there's nothing I can do about that. 

My mom asked me if there was anything I needed and if there was anything she could do to help me towards finding a place. I told her I have a plan in place and just need to wait and save. She at first offered me $2,000 (I'm sure on impulse out of heightened emotions), but I firmly declined. I called her yesterday after a brief encounter with police (neighbor complained, but I'm here legally) left me shaken, and she told me she had written a check for $400 so that I could get everything finalized with my tag renewal and that it was in the mail and to look out for it. She said she can't help out more than this but that she wants to help out where she can. She's done the same for my older sister and then some, and she wants me to be as okay as I can. 

  
She's mailing it this time via check because my older sister went off on her for sending me the $100 because she doesn't like my mom sending me help. Something about the secrecy of it amplifies the thoughts in my mind that this is a bad idea. I've told my mom countless times that while the money has been very helpful and that I appreciate it, she does not have to send me anything. I offered to pay her back, and she said she wouldn't accept it. A large part of me is incredibly grateful to even be talking to her again, but there's still a part of me that hears her family in the back of my mind accusing me of being greedy or taking advantage of her. That is the part that makes me hesitant about accepting anything from her. She is 87 years old, and $400 is no chump change. 

  
There's also a part of me that feels like she's trying to buy my love as my older sister has done in the past. They tend to reflect this idea that money means they care and that spending a lot of it makes up for anything they've done. I've been marathoning Charlotte videos to keep me sane, and there was something she said in one of them something like ""When people apologize, it's often because they feel guilty not sorry"" and that's what this feels like. It feels like she heard me tell her what I've experienced, and she's trying to relieve her guilt by buying forgiveness. This experience has just been so overwhelming that I don't know if I'm making a big deal out of this for nothing and that I should just accept the money and be grateful.

Evidently Josh Brown feels your angst, and felt the need to respond to the chicken hater masses!  

Jonesboro, AR – ([JonesboroRightNow.com](http://jonesbororightnow.com/)) – Construction work has begun on the site of Jonesboro’s first Raising Cane’s restaurant.



Joshua Brown, co-founder of Haag Brown Commercial Real Estate and Development, which brokered the deal, said site work just started and that crews are expected to move quickly.

“We do real estate projects with national chains on many high traffic count locations because they are who pays the most for real estate,” Brown said. “Our core brokerage business is listing commercial properties that we feel we are well-suited to take to market and get the most money for our client. The last five years or so, there have been many chicken and coffee restaurants pop up, not just in Jonesboro, but all over the mid-south.”

  
His job is to maximize profit.  Now there are others who aare more accountable to you, the people, for the futuere development of Jonesboro.

1.  City of Jonesboro (Paying for a long term land use plan that determines what should go where, with consultant selling them on what will maximize all types of tax revenues).  Also responsible for trails and the Parks department, which is doing a decent job.  

2.  Downtown Jonesboro Association 

3. Jonesboro Unlimited - recruits industry(jobs) to Jonesboro

4. Jonesboro Advertising and Promotion Commission (Craig Rickert) collects the hamburger and hotel taxes and uses them to attract tourists to Jonesboro.  Responsible for the Ridge Athletic Center under construction on Race and the BBQ Festival. 

  
What you guys need is a Jonesboro Minister of Culture - or to start these highly profitable operations you yearn for yourselves. I'd like to know exacdtly what they are that would make the chicken haters happy.

I 'F38' and hubby 'M33' have been together 9 years.
I gave birth to our 2nd child during covid and was incredibly ill  for about 8 months afterwards (constant bleeding, uterus didnt contract, severe spinal pain etc)  it was a really tough time and medical help was hard to get.
My husband is a very hands on on dad and despite working long hours he helped as much as he could. 
I recovered, we moved on  but I was left carrying a lot of extra weight.

About 3 years ago, I accidentally stumbled upon his Reddit account. Genuinely didnt mean to. I've never snooped on him in any way, never checked his phone, pockets, mail etc, but I couldn't help myself from having a look through it. 

He had spent a lot of time commenting on thirst traps, looking for free OF subs, telling completely naked women how beautiful they are. There was even a topless woman holding a coffee from a local shop the next town over, when she complained about the coffee he told her to 'come to his and he'll make her decent one'. It was really hard seeing this side of him, but I tried to rationalise it, how men all have needs, and how hard it must have been for him when I was ill. Thats when all of this was happening, when I was still in postpartum recovery.
Ive never told him what I've seen.

Roll onto this year, our youngest is 5, and I've now lost a large amount of weight, over 120lbs. I hoped I would start to feel better, but the weight loss has just brought everything I seen on Reddit straight to the forefront of my mind, and I can't seem to get over it.

Im angry, because I see handsome men on the Internet all the time, but would never dream of commenting on their posts out of respect for my husband. I would never seek out conversation, or offer them company. Im no longer willing to accept the 'men have needs' excuse, because so do women.

We had been together for 1.5 years total (although had split for 2 months early this year before the final breakup). He broke up with me over text while I was away on vacation but I was returning in two weeks.

I’ve begged for an explanation or a reason and so far I haven’t received anything. The last text I sent was three weeks ago when I was arranging to collect my things (which I did via a friend rather than see him irl) and I asked again for a phone conversation. He just ghosted. 
Fast forward to today, I had been doing better, getting involved in hobbies and seeing friends. I miss him a lot but my self worth is growing and I know that I deserve someone better than who would do this to me. 
I was walking into work (we work about 10 mins from each other) and I saw him about 20 m away opposite. I know he recognised me because he completely froze and just waited for me to walk away. I feel like all the progress of the last few weeks is gone and I’m immediately back to the place of “does he miss me, does he regret it, does he feel shame”. I’m reading far too much into the freezing because it was probably more out of shock than anything else but I keep checking my phone expecting a text. 
And the worst thing is, he looked happy. He had a spring in his step and was walking along with a coffee and a pastry.

My phone battery was at 3%, the WiFi was locked and the street completely quiet. Out of options, I slipped inside through a half open side door and found the reception desk area still lit. I sat there hoping someone would show up and about an hour later, someone did. This guy from Argentina, another traveler wandered in who was equally stranded. We laughed at our bad luck and decided to wait it out together. We shared snacks, swapped some funny stories and ended up sleeping on the floor behind the reception counter using our backpacks as pillows. He’d actually bought his sleeping mat from Alibaba, which felt like such a random yet perfect travel detail in that moment. At sunrise, the hostel manager walked in, confused but amused. Instead of being mad, he brewed us coffee and upgraded us to private rooms “for surviving the night.” Really nice guy.

I’ve been to a few city festivals in the past, Rock en Seine in Paris, Bergen fest in Norway, Boston calling in the States and I can now proudly add Corona Capital festival in Mexico City on my list, next summer, July 2026, I have NOS Alive in Lisbon, Portugal coming up. So as you can tell I love my live music.

To hit up Mexico City for 4 days by myself to go to Corona Capital festival ( oh, and I should point out that I do not speak a word of Spanish ) was an experience I will never forget !!! ( in a good way for sure ) 

Corona capital festival - 3 days of music 

Friday 14th November 2025
Saturday 15th November 2025
Sunday 16th November 2025

Day Zero - Thursday 13th November 

I flew from London at 22:30 on Thursday 13th November and arrived into Mexico City at 03:30 am Friday 14th November ( direct flight, hand luggage only, hey I’m only there for a few days and it was cheaper)

I had done a fair bit of research into whether I should get a hotel or Airbnb and where to stay in Mexico City. I went for an Airbnb as it allowed me to relax in a living room, to use a kitchen if I wanted etc etc and an Airbnb worked out as the cheaper option for the neighbourhood I was looking into. 
I was originally in favour of staying near the festival site ( the F1 race track ) and walk in as I’ve done this in other city festivals, but after doing some limited research the neighbourhood where the festival is, isn’t the best, nothing extremely too dodgy/sketchy and from the info I found and now agree with, it just wouldn’t be any fun staying in that neighbourhood. 

So I decided to stay in a cool neighbourhood where I could grab coffee/breakfast and go for walks in the morning and just enjoy the sounds of a city. The neighbourhood called “Roma Norte”, you can’t go wrong with this neighbourhood. A little posh but not to pretentious, think Fulham in London. Couples in the late 20’s walking their dog, families playing in the park, I even stumbled upon a bunch of old boys playing jazz music on the outskirts of a beautiful market on the Sunday morning.

Day one - Friday 14th November 

I landed into Mexico City airport at 03:30 and my first obstacle/ fun task was to get to my Airbnb from the airport. I wanted to use the metro ( underground/subway) as that would have been the cheaper way and it’s always more of a real experience using local transport, but I landed too early and I think the metro was still closed so I grabbed an uber. The experience couldn’t have been any easier. Got to my Airbnb at around 04:15 and had a few hours sleep ( see below about prices and advice on getting to the Airbnb from the airport, I would however change one thing about the timings, I’ll go into detail on that later )

Walked around my neighbourhood “Roma Norte” late Friday morning, grabbed a coffee and an incredible breakfast then jumped on the metro ( one of the reasons I picked my Airbnb was because it was only an 8 minute walk to a metro station), 45 minutes navigating the metro system ( it was honestly so easy to understand, previous to leaving the UK I had downloaded a couple of the Mexico City metro apps so I had already familiarised myself and used these apps along the journey ) 

Got to the “festival site” I didn’t realise how big it would be.  I’m a big F1 racing fan, so to have a music festival on an F1 race track is for sure an added bonus. ( I’ll waffle on about the festival site and what my thoughts were later ) 

I had brought myself a General Admission 3 day ticket via Ticketmaster when the lineup came out in early June 2025. I added the ticket to my apple wallet on my iPhone, it couldn’t have been easier, I also purchased a locker separately which I found very very useful ( more on that later ). 

I always like to get to a festival early ( as soon as the gates open ) so I can check out the merchandise tent, buy a beer and get to know where the stages are etc, 

I got to the main entrance at 14:00 on Friday, I thought gates would be open by then as the music started at 15:20, but the gates didn’t open until 15:00, I’m under the impression that it was slightly delayed on day one due to logistics but the first band wasn’t due on stage until 15:20 so I was more than happy. Found out where the lockers were. Oh I should of mentioned, at Corona Capital no cash is taken on site, you get a braclet when you get in and then you can load money onto the bracelet  with your apple wallet or a credit card ( I think you can get these bracelets in advance and load money onto them in advance but I couldn’t figure out how) I believe any money you don’t use you can get refunded. 

As soon as I had dropped some stuff off at the lockers I grabbed a beer and went straight to my first band ( see the list later for the bands I saw). Such an awesome day !!!!! Now the big stress I had in my mind for quite some time, as I was staying 6 ish miles away from the festival site, how do I get home safely? and considering I can’t speak a word of Spanish would this be a major issue ? It ended up that I didn’t need to worry as it was honestly very easy.  Just had to be a little patient. 

Day one, I wasn’t into the closing headline band as I’ve seen them many times before back in their heyday days, and considering I landed into Mexico City at 03:30 that day I was so tired, so I saw the first hour of the closing band and then left with an hour to go before the end of the festival. 
My plan was to walk for about 10 minutes after I’d exited the festival and get an uber, I pulled it off and got home safe and sound, straight into bed and slept extremely well!!!

Leaving the venue felt a bit Daunting with literally hundreds of taxi drivers shouting “taxi taxi” or street vendors selling replica merchandise or street food, basically a lot of hustle and bustle and noise ( but that’s the fun and joy of experiencing other cities and countries). It all felt safe as there was a big police presence and many other festival goers all in the same boat.
when I was walking, I kept my hands in my pockets holding my phone and wallet, I always felt safe but just like London and other European cities that I’ve traveled to and that have a reputation for pickpocket’s. I tried to be aware of my surroundings as much as possible and not to be walking around staring at the pictures and videos/clips that I’ve just taken on my iPhone (save that for when you get back to the Airbnb). 


Day two  - Saturday 15th November

Very similar, repeat day one but with one big difference I now knew a number of the Unknow’s so my stress level was way less and I got to enjoy the experience of being in a non English speaking city way more, 

Lazy lazy morning. I left my Airbnb late morning and took a slow stroll around the neighbourhood i ended up stumbling upon another incredible cafe/restaurant for coffee and breakfast. Made my way towards the festival similar time. Getting to know the metro system better, I have two train changes  on the journey but now it was becoming easy. The festival gates opened earlier (14:35) and as I now kind of have my bearings I went to the entrance by the lockers, which made it easier and gave me more time to relax and enjoy. Again I saw some incredible music ( see list of bands later) and just generally had more of a relaxing enjoyable experience. At the end of the night, there was no way I was missing the main act, so I left at the end of the night with everyone else, I told myself the journey back to the Airbnb will be what ever it’ll be, I’ll get home, but it’ll just be longer, kind of true, but not really.
I left the festival at around 00:35am, walked 15 Minutes to a junction that I now know is the popular place for pick up and drop off for Ubers, waited 5 minutes and jumped in my uber, again the experience couldn’t be any easier, however as it was after the festival had ended and there were a lot more people about, the price of uber was now double the price from day one ( see below for prices ). This wasn’t ideal but coming from London it was still an acceptable price. So, from time of the closing act on the main stage on day two ( 00:35am ) to walking into my Airbnb it was  01:45 am, 1 hour and 10 minutes. Honestly I wouldn’t change my Airbnb location for anything. Love love love the Roma Norte neighbourhood and hey 70 minutes after the closing act on the main stage play their last song to getting into comfy clothes and bed, I was extremely happy by this 

Day three - Sunday 16th November 

What’s that’s saying/song ? eat, sleep, rave, repeat. Or in this case, eat, sleep, rock, repeat!! 
Again another late ish start, I left my Airbnb around 11:30 am, grabbed breakfast and coffee in another friendly and wonderful cafe/restaurant in the neighbourhood, took a walk  and found a Sunday market in a local park where some old boys were playing jazz, honestly this neighbourhood “Roma Norte” is fantastic!!! Can’t talk about it enough. 

Jumped on the metro, hey, I’m almost a local now, got to the festival grounds without even looking at my metro app, even brought my bottle of water from the same food vendor at the metro station, just like those London commuters getting their coffees from the same coffee shop/stand. Except my bottle of water cost $10 Mexican Pesos - ( £0.40 GBP / $0.65 USD ) - for a 1 litre bottled of cold water instead of London prices. 

Arrived at the festival site at 14:45, gates were already open, not sure when they opened, but again the first band were due to be on stage at 15:20, so time for, guess what, another early doors beer and walk around the festival site. Love this place!!  
Same thing throughout the day, found some hidden gems ( bands) that I’ve never heard of before and no doubt will be listening to for years to come and watched some bands who I’ve seen many many times and like always they pulled off some epic performances ( see list of bands later). 
Another amazing day in the books, however due to a VERY early start on Monday ( read more later) I decided to leave, just like Friday, an hour early before the end of the festival. so I saw an hour of the closing act on the main stage, never seen them before but after an hour I got a good understanding of their vibe and left an hour before their finish time to beat the crowds and head back to my Airbnb to try and get a couple of hours kip before Mondays adventure. Got an uber on night 3 an hour before the headlining act finished for the cheap price, very very happy as being  on my feet for 3 days and the heat throughout the day had taken its toll, but I wouldn’t have it any other way, you can’t beat Live music!!!

Day Four - Monday 17th November 

Hot Air ballon ride !!

One of the advantages of experiencing city festivals is you can do some awesome day trips/excursions during the day and get to know the cities. I’ve noticed that a lot of these city music festival’s, the music doesn’t really kick off until 15:00-17:00 ( I have a feeling that the European festivals do this due to the heat but I’m sure there’s loads of reasons). But this gives you plenty of time to enjoy the city in the day and enjoy the music late afternoon/evening. If you have your eye on a music festival and you’re unsure of the start times, have a look at previous set times to give you an indication of when the festival will start.
When I’ve been to Rock En Seine in Paris in the past, I’ve done half day cycling tours, a wine & cheese tasting session, half day walking tours, etc etc, when I went to Boston Calling festival in the States I did a freedom walking tour. Generally I’m a big believer in trying to maximise my time, however I never, or I should be honest as say I TRY to never  miss the opening of the gates for a festival. 

Whilst I was doing my research for Corona Capital festival in Mexico City, I found that there were some ancient Pyramids about an hour away from the city and it was really popular to go over the Pyramids for a sunrise hot air balloon ride !!! Oh for sure!! Sign me up!!

On Monday evening my flight was due to head back to London leaving Mexico City at 22:00, so giving me plenty of time for a cool trip that Monday. There were a bunch of options for 5-11 hour tours, I went for the longer one as in all honesty I had to check out of my Airbnb and I had my bag and plenty of time to kill. But foolishly after getting into bed 01:00 that Sunday night I had to set my alarm for 03:00 so that I can meet up with the tour group for 04:30. Regretted at the time of the alarm but 3 hours later I was loving it.

Wow !!! What a day !!! Hot air balloon ride is a must !!! Saw the sunrise as we “flew” over the pyramids, stunning !!! I did a tour which incorporated 4 different stops. The hot air balloon ride and then later walking amongst the pyramids were definitely a city festival high !! Got back to México city around 15:30
I went pretty much went  straight to the airport, killed a few hours at the airport as I wasn’t flying until 22:00 on Monday night, getting me back to the London Tuesday afternoon. Chilling at the airport going through the countless pictures and videos that I’ve taken on my phone is a real joy, honestly this “weekend” just gone is up there as one of my favourites 

Day five - Tuesday 18th November 

Landed back into London Heathrow at 15:00 on Tuesday afternoon, a long long long tiring flight but all straight forward, back to my apartment  for 17;00, throw some laundry on, and ready for what I believe and hope, after 5 incredible incredible epic days on the go will be a solid nights sleep and hopefully dreaming of my next festival venture maybe estereo  picnic in Bogotá, Colombia,any advice? Shoot me a message 

My thoughts on Mexico City 

I used to live in the States for a number of years back in the day and in the past I’ve done a number of nights out in Mexico when you cross the boarder in neighbouring towns, but that’s just getting drunk in a bar with your mates, so I’ve never really experienced the true Mexico, but I’m so glad i have now. 

Mexico City is honestly such a vibrant and friendly city. Ok, I’m not naive, all city’s have their problems but what ever Netflix, Amazon prime etc wish for you to believe, it’s simple not true. 
I’m not a foodie, give me a bowl of cereal or a McDonalds and I’m all set but my foodie mates were impressed with me, as on this trip I ventured out to cafes and restaurants and tried foods that I never thought I would of tried, and do you know what, I honestly loved everything about it, the variety, the taste, the price, the experience etc etc, Mexico City has some banging food !!! ( I know my foodie mates are reading this saying “we told you so”. Green space, especially in Roma Norte was everywhere, the metro system was so easy to navigate and get around, it does however shut around midnight ish hence why I used Ubers at night. 
My lack of Spanish was never really a major issue, but that being said, my personal thoughts and experiences are different to everyone else’s but I was surprised that I struggled a little on the language front, not everyone understood my English. I assumed the younger generation would understand me but not always the case. everyone that I spoke to, tried to help me and pretended to understand me. I got by with no major issues other than me thinking, what a lazy arse I’ve been over these years and I really should try and learn the basics to a language. 

I guess I caught Mexico City on a good weekend, I guess Mexico City caught me on a good weekend, I guess leaving rainy, cold, dark England in the middle of November to go and dance, drink and explore for a few days in the sun, or I guess maybe it’s a combination of all the above but whatever it was, I was so impressed with Mexico, Mexico City, the locals, and Corona Capital festival. I can’t wait to go back!! Maybe for an F1 race, maybe for the “day of the dead” celebrations/festival and for sure hopefully back to Corona Capital festival.

General info on my experiences for Corona Capital Festival

Very limited internet on site


My take on Corona Festival & the venue 

As I’ve mentioned before, I’ve been to a few city festivals so I had some idea of what I could expect but also I did have a few concerns/reservations which ended up to be pointless worrying. 

Venue

A festival on a F1 race track, as a big music fan, a big fan of travelling and experiencing new adventures and as a big F1 racing fan, I’m 100% sold !!!! I was sooooo impressed on how Corona Capital used the race track to their advantage and also recognised and managed the disadvantages of it, for instance I might be wrong on this but the main stage was positioned away from the sun ( for the crowd ) and the pit straight of the F1 track with all the hospitality boxes etc are used for the posh rich VIP tickets, and it looked amazing !!! sadly I will never know first hand what VIP is like, but I loved how they used the structures and infrastructure to their advantage. My BIG BIG concern was whether I was going to be standing on concrete all day long for 3 straight days.  

I went to Bourbon & Beyond festival in the States in September 2024. The Venue was basically one big dusty concrete/gravel car park with military and Fed Ex/UPS planes flying extremely low over 2 of the stages. Not to sound pretentious but I’ve been to many festivals scattered around some awesome countries and the lack of care and thought towards the ticket holders. Bourbon & Beyond festival has ruined my believe and thoughts on how a festival, that always has such solid line ups, treats their fans/customers/audiences. Sorry this post is honestly about praising a festival not slagging another festival off, haha, anyways 

So here was me thinking “great, potentially another Bourbon & Beyond type venue’ but thankfully oh helllllll NO !!!!! It was the exact opposite. Corona Capital had clearly put a lot of thought about this and covered virtually everything up with some sort of green matting ( I’ve gone down the googling internet rabbit hole to find out what sort of matting it is, but still clueless ), who cares, it’s incredible, it’s comfy under foot and Corona Capital and maybe other festivals use it and it works wonders. clearly Corona Capital have taken a lot a thought process about this and they believe in, if you look after your customers they will look after you. take note Bourbon & Beyond).

The sound quality was pretty good. All stages and tents were positioned in well thought out places so there was little to no bottleknecks of crowds, Corona Capital had obviously given some thought and clearly planned when certain bands would play and on which stages to have as little sound bleeding etc as possible.  I did however witness 2 bands having issues with sound during their sets but it’s live music, sometimes it happens, it was on different stages and not repeated so I wasn’t too worried.

My only reservations about Corona Capital were the vendors. It might just be a cultural thing, so I won’t rant too much about it, I’ve been to a bunch of baseball games in the States and you have the “beer guy” or the “hotdog/food guy” constantly walking around selling Food & Beverages to you from the comfort of your seat. Basically it was like that but every 5 seconds someone walking by shouting “cerveza” “cerveza”.  I know, I know, if my mates back home could hear me complaining about this I’d be ridiculed for the rest of my life.  - One - These vendors are offering you a service, and, an extremely good service at that, as they’re working their arses off to provide you with food and beer, so that your lazy arse doesn’t need to leave your spot in front of the stage and line up at the bar - And two - it’s food and beer, who doesn’t want food and beer handed to you at a festival whilst you’re enjoining your favourite band.
I should really stop my moaning about this, as culturally I cannot seeing it change, but there were a number of times I was watching a chilled/mellow band and the song was at that chilled moment and the vibe was all calm and then, pow!! All of a sudden, some guy shouts “cerveza”, “cerveza” right in my ear and it spoils that moment that live music/performance provides. You get my point, it was just my only niggle.

Size of the venue, it was big for sure but didn’t feel to big, the crowds were scattered from stage to stage, food stands to sponsor/promotion stands to merchandise stands to the ferris wheel, basically it never felt too crowded at all, as the venue used the size to their advantage. There was plenty of shade about and in all honesty at that time of the year and in that part of the world the blazing sun is done by 16:30. 

Ubers 

I’ve talked way too much about this, apart from one difference. This festival i personally and purposely made a choice. As i was by myself and i had to get home by myself in a non English speaking city, I made a conscious effort of not drinking/smoking too much. Maybe I’ll have a few more beers next time but i was for sure happy about keeping a check on how much I drank throughout the day/evening so that I had no issues about getting home

Toilets

Always a hot topic at festivals, fear not, Corona capital had plenty of toilets and looked after them. This ain’t the 90’s in muddy England anymore. This is an amazing festival in an incredible city trying to make everyone’s experience as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. I personally never saw a line for them, they had bathroom attendants which did an awesome job keeping them clean etc. the men had urinals which meant the stalls were not used by the guys. Ultimately everyone seemed happy, one thing I did noticed was the lack of toilet rolls in the stalls, the bathroom attendant’s had plenty and were offering it out and providing it, but on my person when I go into any festival I always have a small bottle of hand sanitiser, one of those £1/$1 small packs of baby wipes and one of those £1/$1 small packs of tissues just in case. 

Food and Beverages 

Soooooo many choices, alcohol wasn’t cheap, wasn’t crazy, it was more like European festival price, not extortionate US festival price. Obviously the beer of choice was Corona, one of those big tall cans cost $200 Mexican pesos ( £8 GBP / $11 USD ) a pizza maybe equivalent to 3 slices of a dominoes pizza was $120 Mexican pesos ( £5 GBP/ $7.50 USD ). So not cheap, but acceptable in my eyes, you, for sure, won’t go hungry or thirsty and the choices are extremely wide and varied catering for everyone’s needs and wants. The donuts in the evening when the sun goes down are a must !!!

Crowd/ Audience 

What can I say. Just such a friendly welcoming crowd. A real mix of ages and by the looks of everyone’s band t shirts a mix of music tastes. LOVE it!!! Now in all honesty I  didn’t chat to, too many people. Nowadays I’m a bit of a loan wolf and prefer my own company, keep myself to myself etc etc, I blame Covid but that’s another rant another time, ironic how I’m at my happiest when I’m by myself in a crowd of 50k -200k people, watching live music. That being said I did strike up some lovely conversations with some awesome people throughout the weekend. A couple of the mosh pits that I was on the outskirts of, I saw that everyone was caring and looking after each other.  I saw no crazy drunkenness or people in trouble. It was refreshing and such a joy to be in a crowd who looks after each other. 
What I’ve noticed about city festivals offering day tickets and weekend long passes, on each day you’ll have the crowd gearing to what type of music plays. Sunday’s theme was more hard rock, Saturday a bit more pop, so the crowds were a little different on each of these days, it was cool to see.

Weather

Well I am from England after all, so I best talk about the weather. I know I know it can vary every year, so don’t take my word as gospel, but wow !!! It was stunning. As the F1 racing commentators constantly bang on about the  F1 race track being at an altitude of 2200 meters/ 7000 feet. I personally didn’t feel any difference to breathing etc and I’d be surprised if anyone does but the temperatures switches so rapidly, day time, wow !! 26c but as soon as the sun goes down, you better have a big hoodie, a beanie and maybe even one of those North Face  lightweight puffy jackets. It got cold!!! Like cold cold, Day one, I made the rookie mistake of not bringing my jacket into the venue, day two and three, I had all the layers. So that’s where the locker came into play. Genius idea and it worked out at $330 Mexican pesos ( £14 GBP / $18 USD ) per day. Definitely worth it, come 18:30-19:00 in the evening you’ll be thinking about a jacket. My experience of the weather was perfect, as there was no rain in the forecast, just bright sunny days and cool evenings. I guess the festival gods were looking after me, but travel with what you can, worst case leave it in the locker.

Spending 

As mentioned before Corona Capital is cashless and have introduced a bracelet system, where you load money on. 

On day one, as soon as I went into the festival, I put $3000 Mexican pesos ( £124 GBP / $163 USD ) onto my bracelet. I brought a T-shirt had 2 maybe 3 beers a day some good food and after day 3 I still had $600 Mexican pesos ( £25 GBP / $33 USD ) left on my bracelet, I’ll figure out how to get that refunded to me in the coming days but all the staff I talked to, said it was easy, Just jump on their website after the festival. 


Cost of some of the extras, (rough currency conversions)

Night one - $230 Mexican pesos  ( £10 GBP / $13 USD ) - Uber from the festival to Roma Norte  neighbourhood ( where my Airbnb is located, 6 ish miles, maybe a 25- 30 min drive, ) when I left 1 hour before headlining act closed on day one 

Night Two - $510  Mexican pesos ( £21 GBP / $28 USD - Uber from the festival to Roma Norte  neighbourhood ( where my Airbnb is located 6 ish miles, maybe a 25- 30 min drive, ) when I left after the headlining act closed on day two

Night Three - $230 Mexican pesos  ( £10 GBP / $13 USD ) - Uber from festival to Roma Norte  neighbourhood ( where my Airbnb is located, 6 ish miles, maybe a 25- 30 min drive, ) when I left 1 hour before headlining act closed on day three 

After day one at the festival I was curious as to how much a taxi would cost to get back to my Airbnb, I asked around and got quoted $500 Mexican pesos (£21 GBP / $28 USD) for a taxi from one of the many many taxi drivers outside the festival exit gate for a ride from the festival to Roma Norte neighbourhood.

$180 Mexican pesos ( £8 GBP / $10 USD )  - uber from airport to Roma Norte neighbourhood (where my Airbnb is located ) at 03:30 am 

$420 Mexican pesos ( £17 GBP / $23 USD ) - official Corona Capital t shirt brought from inside the venue

$10 Mexican Pesos - ( £0.40 GBP / $0.65 USD ) - for a 1 litre bottled of still cold water from a street vendor in the metro station 

Big big Rookie mistakes I made but thankfully got away with

Travelling by myself, I had all my Airbnb details on my iphone, the address and 2 codes to enter, if I had dropped my phone and it broken beyond repair ( which I’ve done in the past ) or I lost my phone, or if someone had taken it, I was proper screwed 

Next time I will have pictures of the Airbnb address and pictures of the door codes/codes for lock box and send it to someone back home who’s phone number I remember, so worst case scenario I can contact them and they have all the info.  Plus I’ll always have the equivalent of $30 USD in local currency to get a taxi 

Big big Rookie mistake I made but thankfully got away with 

When I arrived into Mexico City I got an uber from Mexico City airport to the Airbnb in the early hours of Friday morning, I arrived at my Airbnb at 04:15 It was still dark outside, although I specifically got an Airbnb in a “safe” and beautiful neighbourhood. It’s not an ideal situation to arrive at 03:55 and spend 5 mins walking up and down dark alleys to try and find the right door, unlike hotels sometimes the entrance to an Airbnb is never as easy to find as you may/hope to think.

I think next time I’d kill a little bit of time at the airport with a book and coffee and wait until daylight 


Minor Rookie mistake I made but got away with 

A back up toothbrush as I only travel with my electric toothbrush and the power converter didn’t work for some reason, but I brought a toothbrush from the shops 

Minor Rookie mistake 

I wish I had more time in Mexico City and got to experience more of the city. Sadly i couldn’t take anymore time off work. I definitely felt like I made the best out of my time. But next time a cheeky cooking class or history walking tour, or a taco and tequila tour which normally run in the evenings not mornings ( I assume hey ) but I would definitely give me self 2 or 3 extra days next time

Sum up !!!!

Go, go, go !!! to Corona Capital festival, you won’t regret it.

Buy a ticket for general admission and a 3 day locker pass in advance. Not sure of VIP passes, but I had no complaints with all the facilities and experiences that the general admission pass offers

Get a hotel or Airbnb in the Roma Norte 
neighbourhood, and don’t worry about taxis/ubers at the end of the night, it’s always possible and being in the Roma Norte neighbourhood will make your experience so much more enjoyable 

Try and venture out and about in the mornings, cafes/restaurants/parks, walking tours etc, Mexico City is beautiful and from my experience the locals are proud of their city and rightly so, they want to show off their city, 

Embrace adventure, know that you’ll make some rookie mistakes as well, don’t worry about it, it’s the joy of travelling and living. 

Hope this waffling review or whatever it is  helps you, any questions about Corona Capital festival please feel free to reach out

1p0f5c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Truckers/comments/1p0f5c6/2023_i_think_kenworth_t680_versus_2025/,2023 I think Kenworth t680 versus 2025 Freightliner cascadia.. my experience.,"So just got into the Freightliner for the first time and have had a few days to drive it. The main difference is the t680 drives much more like a sports car not in acceleration but in Road handling. The Freightliner rocks and rolls like your on a spring on top of a go-kart.

Now the Freightliner does have this nice sort of effect where you hear a little bit of this I guess it's the turbo whine is it spools up and starts to accelerate. And that's kind of fun on open roads with light loads. I'm not sure it had the same pulling power as the t680 when heavily loaded though. I don't think it does.

And that Freightliner definitely will get into a side to side rocking as you accelerate off of a stop sign if you hit the pedal too lightly. You'll be rocking and rolling literally toggling left and right and tell you adjust your pressure on the brake pedal to kind of make that cycle disappear.

Other than that a truck is a truck with automatic transmission these days.

They're all pretty nice although they're all underpowered to save on fuel.

Anyway that's my thought.

Cup holders in the cascadia are way too low in front. You really have to reach down to get a normal size coffee cup and I don't like having to do that. You're not touching the floor but you're only about I guess six or eight inches from it it seems like.

I'd like to find some kind of extender to raise that up. Or put one hanging off of the driver door armrest or something.

Also the massive Detroit camera vision system that's in the top center of the windshield and is bigger than your normal Apple iPad tablet really blocks your view when you're trying to look at cars coming onto the interstate from an on-ramp when you're on the interstate.

1p0f0gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1p0f0gb/unhappily_no_longer_unemployed/,"Unhappily ""no longer unemployed""","So I just started a new job as a senior UI/graphic designer and I honestly don’t know what to think. It’s only been a few days, but something feels… off. And I can’t tell if it’s me being dramatic or if the environment really isn’t right.

* On paper, it’s solid. People are actually nice. I’ve already found a few colleagues I click with, so it doesn’t feel cold or isolating. The office is comfortable, plenty of coffee machines, little perks here and there. The company pays on time, seems stable, the vibe isn’t toxic, no obvious gossip circles. If I just look at the atmosphere, it’s pleasant. I got good equipment on day one, nobody’s breathing down my neck, and overall it feels stable. And yeah, the salary is decent for where I live — not amazing, but not bad.
* But the reality of the work is kind of rough. I was hired as a senior designer, but I’m basically churning out low-quality gambling ads all day. Ugly banners non-stop, repetitive dimensions. Nothing I could ever use in a portfolio. No UX work, no websites, no growth. Just production design that feels like a downgrade from what I’m capable of.
* Then there’s the structure. They have a system for EVERYTHING — naming conventions, folder trees, saving rules, an external task platform that feels like a maze. In theory structure is good; in practice, I’m running in circles trying to even find what files I’m supposed to use. Half of them are missing, broken, or outdated. It’s “organized chaos,” emphasis on chaos. The manager communicates mostly through chat (she sits next door), gives unclear instructions, replies hours later and I’ve already been warned that she sometimes fires people without saying anything about what they did wrong if it was repetetive misconduct-no strikes.
* The tasks keep piling up — several every day — without explanations. It’s weirdly isolating too. No introduction to the team-just ""heres ur seat"", people mostly talk only within their little desk clusters. I came from a team that felt like a family, and now it’s the complete opposite. Though I'm aware t this is more of a rarity to be close with your colleagues.
* The work culture is also way less flexible than I hoped for. This is my biggest deal breaker. No home office during probation, and after that only two days a week — and Mondays/Fridays aren’t allowed. I was actively looking for something flexible this time because me and my bf would like the option to move cities or even countries eventually without losing our jobs. Now that seems impossible. Though he managed to get a position in an amazing company with flexible schedule like that and it makes me feel even worse.
* And then the raise situation… I was told raises here basically don’t happen. Maybe once every couple years, and the first bump is something like 30 bucks. Meanwhile, at my *previous* shady company, I got my first raise after three months with zero portfolio and no degree. Here, I asked for a higher salary during interviews, and they said they’d “give me more once I settle in.” Now I honestly doubt that.

So I’m confused. The job is stable and the people are nice, but I still feel attrocious. Part of me wonders if I got accostomed to not working during my 1.5 months of unemployement and I should just stay for the stability, and then another part of me feels like my gut is telling me this isn’t where I’m meant to be.

My bestie and I just finished up a coffee walk (we take our coffee and take a walk) in the rain, and rather than talk about fascism and how much it fucking sucks, we talked about all the lessons we learned from those unhappy relationships in our past. And how much less we date and how picky we are now that we are in our 40’s and 50’s.


If you started your ENM/polyam when you were younger, in your teens or early twenties, like we did, and stayed, how different is your dating now, vs. when you started? 

Like I said, I’m much pickier, but I’m also far less convinced that the force of my will or the purity of my good intentions will result in an unexpected favorable outcome. 

My list of things I probably won’t deal with is long. Oh, so long. I’m in my 50’s. Mostly retired. I have a lovely life and a circle of long time friends who have, literally always come through for each other, and continues to do so! 
That said, my lists have changed! Ages and stages 


I probably won’t deal with: 

people who can’t/won’t travel *with me*, but do travel with their spouse or nesting partner.

When I was younger, and everyone had small kids? This was softer. But now? Our kids are grown. If you’ve made a promise to your wife that you won’t ever travel with another partner? Naw. 

Weekends. Not every weekend, not all weekends. But some weekends, some times, in full and in part. 

Overnights. 

Things I absolutely won’t deal with:

Vetos. In any form. Not because I think they are unethical (I don’t). Not because they make me feel disposable (I won’t be around long enough to find out). Because a well defined, explicit, agreed to in advance, under *any circumstances* veto tells me that someone in that dyad is problematic. 

No thank you.

*and I can hear it now…but bloo, if their spouse  makes them break up with you, you got vetoed!!  You can’t avoid it!!* 

That’s just someone who broke up with, for better or worse, because someone else wanted them to. It feels shitty to be broken up with, but like that was their choice, and if they try and pretend they lack agency in this break up, I have dodged a bullet. I like my people to have a backbone. 



Deadbeat parents. Not non-custodial parents, not parents with teens who hate them, not parents in general. Specially parents who abandoned their fiscal responsibility to their child, and left it up to a single parent to navigate your child’s life. This one ? In my youth? I took some folks at their word. I got told some big stories. Live and learn. 

Now? Absolutely not. 

People who are freaked out by STI’s. I am immmune compromised. I care more about most infections that most people ever will. I’ve had to learn more about disease transmission than I ever wanted to. 

I can only fuck people who live in a world where facts matter.  If you are my age, and have a long history with non-monogamy, and don’t understand the basics around testing, barriers and transmission, we won’t fuck. 

This has been an ever evolving situation. My risk tolerance is situational. 🤷‍♀️

1p0epzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPGIndustry/comments/1p0epzm/ozempic_users_are_reshaping_cpg_spend_in/,Ozempic Users Are Reshaping CPG Spend in Surprising Ways,"A new deep-dive from **Circana** (shared via [*The New Consumer*](https://newconsumer.com/)) breaks down how GLP-1 users are changing the food, beverage, and retail landscape — and it’s way more nuanced than the “they’re eating less” narrative.

GLP-1 households now make up an estimated **23% of U.S. households**, and by 2030, Circana expects them to account for **35% of all food units purchased** in the U.S. The data shows big shifts toward protein, hydration, and nutrient-dense products — with deli meats, yogurt, seafood, granola bars, and citrus all outperforming. Meanwhile, categories high in sugar, alcohol, saturated fat, and refined carbs are taking a hit, including wine, canned cocktails, doughs, bakery snacks, and pasta.

One of the most interesting insights: GLP-1 users still *treat themselves*, but the “treat” becomes a **tiny luxury**, like fries or cookies — not a binge. It’s indulgence in smaller, more intentional portions.

Beyond food and beverage, GLP-1 users are also reshaping retail. They already indexed high on clothing and accessories before starting the drug… and that spending increases during active use. Handbags, athletic wear, denim, and boots all see meaningful upswings. Circana notes that **86% of users say they feel like a “different person”**, which helps explain the spike in fashion and self-expression purchases.

Despite calorie reduction, GLP-1 households remain **high-value consumers**, shifting spend across channels (more Club + e-comm, less dollar/drug) while maintaining or increasing total CPG spend. The bigger story here isn’t decline — it’s **redistribution**.

**Source –**

[*The New Consumer*](https://newconsumer.com/) 

If these spending shifts continue, which categories do you think will see the biggest long-term disruption — and which brands are best positioned to win in a GLP-1 world?

1p0epqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1p0epqg/helppp_best_toothpaste_for_enamel_erosion/,Helppp: Best Toothpaste for Enamel Erosion,"I'm a 23F who has been having coffee for the past 3 years (I started in college to survive through exam weeks and haven’t looked back ever since).

 I had an appointment (a month ago) with my dentist for the sensitivity that I’d been facing for a couple of months, and turns out I have “mild enamel erosion”, especially on my front teeth. 

My dentist used the term ""acid wear,"" and now I'm worried and googling everything about it like crazy on how to fix it. I found that, although toothpastes can't reverse the damage, the right kind of toothpaste can manage sensitivity and protect the enamel from further damage. I'm also supposed to start a dental bonding procedure to restore the enamel. 

I'm looking for recommendations for the **Best All-in-One Toothpaste** that can handle my 3 main concerns. Specifically, I need something that is:

1. Enamel Fortifying: Needs an active ingredient that actively helps *re-mineralize* or strengthen the weakened enamel surface.
2. Sensitivity Relief: I need suggestions for toothpastes that have proven to offer long-lasting relief from that sharp zing when something cold hits my teeth.
3. Everyday Protection: Obviously, it still needs to be a great everyday paste for general plaque and cavity prevention.

I tried a whitening toothpaste a few months ago, and I think it actually made the sensitivity *wors*e (I bought it hoping to get better teeth whiteness, not for enamel protection). 

I've heard the Pronamel line is the industry standard for this issue, but they have so many versions (Intensive Repair, Mineral Boost, Daily Protection). Which one is the real MVP? And if there are better brands, pls suggest.

If you've successfully overcome acid wear or finally got relief from sensitivity, please drop the name of the product that you used and all other ways that worked for you.

Also, I would really appreciate it if you could also mention the active ingredients that made the difference for you! (e.g., ""Potassium Nitrate blocks the pain,"" or ""Stannous Fluoride forms a protective barrier."")

It would just stall up, or the coffee would come out in a trickle. I believe the issue is the gasket that seals the group head to the pump. It is losing pressure and cannot extract properly. You can test this theory with some liquid soap and running a little bit around the rim and then brewing a shot. Soap will come out the edges and bubble up. It seems like it is not giving a proper seal. One thing I have tried to mitigate the issue is to wet the gasket before use like putting a small amount water in the middle of the group head and then attaching the pump. It seems to work better that way. I think I look into using a neutral flavor cooking oil like Avocado oil as a lubricant to see if that helps with the seal later on.

1p0ekgf,https://i.redd.it/0305h45h812g1.jpeg,The Flesh of Mr. Jackknife,"Beth pushes open the rusted metal doors of the warehouse and steps inside. Dark bruises cover her face and arms. She nervously hugs a dead flashlight to her chest. She walks down the corridor, stepping over shadowy shapes as she presses forward.

The door on the opposite end of the corridor flings open, allowing the dim fluorescent bulbs of the next room to provide light to the decrepit corridor. Beth notices the shapes she has been stepping over are bodies, brutalized and sliced into pieces. Another shape can be seen pushing itself through the doorway. At first it’s vaguely the shape of a man, but as it moves forward its silhouette betrays the guise of humanity. It’s soft and wet and undulates as it moves. Beth screams.

To a cameraman, it was a great shot. To some young theater goers, hiding their eyes in fear, it would be perfect. To Clark Harris, it would need a reshoot.

“CUT!”

I stopped the camera, and wiped the sweat from my brow. The heat in the warehouse was oppressive, and stepping out into the cool autumn air brought instant relief. I lit up a cigarette and watched the treeline surrounding the warehouse. I held the smoke in and allowed it to dance in my lungs.

I was deep in thought when the warehouse’s back door swung open, making me jump. I cleared my throat and shifted my weight back and forth anxiously. Michelle, with an air of attitude in her movements, sat on the steps just outside of the door. Her curly blonde hair was disheveled and covered with fake dirt and her skin was covered with cosmetic bruises and wounds. 

I turned around and tried to avoid acknowledging the awkward silence occurring between us. She was much younger than me. I couldn’t think of any common ground between us, no small talk ideas came to mind. 

A few moments passed and I turned around again to face her. Her blue eyes pierced into mine. She cradled her head in her hands and had a frustrated look on her face. Wordlessly, I pulled a smoke from the pack and held it out to her. She took it, and placed it in her mouth. She continued staring at me. I had never felt so intimidated by someone half my size. Then the realization hit me like a bag of bricks. 

“Shit, yeah… sorry,” I said, holding my lighter out to her, flame flickering in the autumn breeze.

***

“What do you think of that thing, man? Freaky, right?” Clark was beaming with energy, his eyes darting back and forth between me and the latex nightmare before me. “Here he is, our Mr. Jackknife,” he said excitedly, as if I might have missed it.

“Man, the detail is unreal. We should get some close ups,” I replied, my mind swimming with ideas. I would be lying if I said I fully understood Clark’s vision from the get go, but seeing our monster standing in front of us made this whole project feel more real.

It looked like a man wearing a long trench coat, standing a little over 7 feet tall. Long gangly arms hung at its sides, with rods connected to the wrists and elbows for the puppeteers to control them. Inside the trench coat was a glistening mass of fake flesh and slime. Gleaming blades of all different shapes and sizes protruded from all angles of the pile of gore. A fedora topped the head of the monstrosity, and a twisted, fleshy visage lay underneath it.

“Did a bang up job didn’t he?” Clark jabbed a thumb in the direction of a man who was hunched over mixing a bowl of slime with a paintbrush. He looked up from his work. I smiled and raised a hand in greeting.

“Nice to meet you. I assume you are Robert, I have heard a lot about you.” The man said. “I’m Steven, I have been working with puppetry and effects for many years. I have constructed a team of very talented individuals. Your project is in the right hands.”

“You can call me Rob if you’d like,” I replied. “I do the camera work. We filmed a short scene with your team last night, though I didn’t get to see him in the light.” I gestured towards Mr. Jackknife.

“He’s truly wonderful, isn’t he?” Steven mused. “My greatest creation yet.”

Once the puppet had been properly caked in slime, we could begin the filming. It was an outdoor scene, making the heat of the warehouse a distant memory. The scene would require Michelle to have a fight with Mr. Jackknife. It had all the makings of a fun shoot, and I was excited. We had choreographed the whole thing, and had practiced a bit with the puppet without the cameras rolling. Steven hadn’t lied, his team was immensely talented. The flesh under the monster’s coat seemed to ripple and breathe with each movement.

I began setting up the camera, dialing in the angle for the shot. I was peering through the viewfinder when a tap on my shoulder caused me to jump. It was Michelle, with a wide grin on her face, and an outstretched hand. She really had a knack for scaring me. When I realized what she was asking for, I started to laugh.

“You some kind of charity case now?” I asked, digging in my pocket for the box of smokes.

“C’mon, I need something to chill me out.” she replied, accepting the cigarette and lighter. “I’m probably gonna have to film this scene a hundred times.”

“Clark is a particular guy, I’m surprised he doesn’t come over here and get behind the camera,” I chuckled. “How did you end up on this project anyway?”

“I’m a barista at a coffee shop nearby. Clark came in and asked me if I wanted to get paid to be in a movie. I asked him if it was *that* kind of movie, and he said no.”

I thought about what a fool Clark was and laughed even harder. “No shit, and you said yes?”

“Mama always said I had a face for the pictures.” Michelle said with a shrug. I could barely believe what I was hearing. Michelle did great work, I thought for sure she was some actress Clark had found with a casting call. Before I could say anything else, she was bounding off to the set, and I went back to my camera.

The filming night dragged on, I listened to Clark shout out his revisions while the increasingly tired Michelle continued perfecting the scene. The puppeteers slid Mr. Jackknife across the floor, resetting him back to his starting position. I realized as I watched through the viewfinder that I had never spoken to either of them, even though they seemed to accompany Steven everywhere. They were constantly hooded and wearing all black, which made sense during filming, but not in between scenes.

I aimed the camera and zoomed in, attempting to spot the face of the puppeteer controlling Mr. Jackknife's arms. The camera slowly zoomed in and for a fleeting second I captured a motion blurred look at the puppeteer. He was extremely pale, his ghost white skin highly contrasting his black attire. He had sharp angular features, and had no visible eyebrows. I heard Clark yelling for the shoot to begin again, and I readied the camera.

Beth runs down a dark and damp alleyway before a brick wall blocks her path. She’s panting and begins to scramble for a way out. Behind her, a shape is closing in. It walks with slow and heavy footsteps and its body sways side to side. The shape stops in front of Beth, now illuminated by the lights nearby. Beth sees the face underneath the hulking monster’s hat and begins to panic. His hand pulls back a side of the trench coat and reveals a squirming mass of flesh and jagged blades. He reaches for the hilt of a knife that protrudes from his chest. With a sickening sound, the knife slowly exits the flesh, blood and bile eject from the now open hole. The knife, covered in viscera, rises above the creature’s head. Then the massive body of the beast collapses forward, crashing on top of Beth and onto the ground.

“CUT!” Clark says, flying out of his director's chair. “The fuck just happened?”

I shared in Clark’s confusion. That was not the way we had been rehearsing the scene for the past several hours. Beth was supposed to yank a blade of her own from Mr. Jackknife’s body, and start stabbing the puppet. Clark shoved the puppeteers out of the way and lifted the puppet from the ground. By this time I was already running over to them as well. When I finally reached the pair my heart sank.

Beth laid on the ground covered in fake blood and slime, but among the sea of bright red was a deep, darker crimson. Michelle had a large gash in her forehead, and blood poured down the left side of her face. 

“What the fuck man?!” I found myself shouting. “She’s hurt, man. We need to get her to a hospital now!” I tore off my overshirt and Clark used it to compress the wound. I looked around me and noticed Steven and his team were nowhere to be found. Marching off set, I spotted one of the puppeteers in his black clothing, standing still with his back towards me.

“Hey man, you need to tell me what just happened, that was not how that was supposed to go!” I couldn't hide my anger, and when I got no response, not even a turn in my direction, my anger bubbled over. 

“I’m talking to you, asshole!” I say, my palm landing hard on the puppeteer's shoulder and spinning him around. It was the pale man that I had spotted in the viewfinder. His eyes were unfocused, not looking in any particular direction. His mouth was partially open, like a cartoon character under hypnosis.

“Did he get the blood?” His words were slurred like a drunk man’s.

“What?”

“The blood, he smelled like flesh.”

The man’s eyes focused on mine while I stared at him in confusion. Then he walked past me, allowing his shoulder to collide with mine as he walked forward, almost robotically. Clark and Steven seemed to be in the middle of a frantic conversation, while the second puppeteer stood nearby.

“This was due to a mistake by my team, and I intend to make it right to the best of my ability,” Steven was saying as I approached. He helped the injured Michelle to her feet and they began to head to Steven’s station wagon. I felt strange about the situation, but if Michelle was getting medical attention then I figured it was for the best.

“Steven said he’s gonna take care of everything, Rob. He’s taking Michelle to the hospital. He said they used real blades in the puppet because it showed up better on camera, they never expected an accident like that to happen,” Clark explained, as if he was trying to convince himself more than me. 

I could feel my heart thumping in my ears, the adrenaline of the situation was wearing off and the panic was starting to set in. “Clark, man, this is all fucked! What if Michelle is really hurt, man? She's just some random girl you pulled off of the street.” My mind was spinning in circles. So many worst case scenarios were running through my head. What if we got sued? My mind selfishly wondered how Clark and I would deal with the repercussions of what had happened. Clark interrupted my manic pacing by grabbing my shoulders.

“Chill out Rob, chill!” He said, staring me in the eyes. I couldn’t return his gaze, my eyes were on my shoes. “Listen buddy, this has been our dream since school, remember? Nobody ever said it would be easy. This is what we always wanted man, think about it! Theatres full of scared kids watching our movie! Kids dressing up as Mr. Jackknife for Halloween! This is what we always wanted to do!” 

After a few minutes and some deep breaths I was more grounded than before. My mind went back to the strange way the puppeteer was acting. When I explained to Clark what happened, he said something that was even stranger.

“Yeah one of them was listening in on Steven and I when we were figuring out what to do with Michelle. Weird looking guy, super pale and totally hairless.”

How was that possible? The man that I had been talking to had the exact same appearance. Was I overthinking this? I had a massive pit in my stomach that I couldn’t ignore. 

Clark, unable to read the room, chose this time to tell me that we weren’t actually allowed to be filming in this alleyway. Apparently he hadn’t bothered to go through the proper channels to secure permission. We set to cleaning up the set and getting all of our equipment back in storage before deciding our next move. In the frantic mess that was the night's events I had failed to notice that Mr. Jackknife was nowhere to be found.

“Hey Clark, did Steven take the puppet with him?”

“I don’t know why he would, can you not find it?”

As Clark walked over I noticed the slimy, muddy footprints leading out of the alleyway out into the street. Logically it must have been from a crew member that had stepped in some slime while working on set. But why were the shoe prints so large?

Before we knew it, we were driving. We abandoned all of the film equipment and left. Something had felt wrong to both of us, and we decided that if there was a chance we could help, we should try. I looked out the window solemnly. Clark was right, it had always been a dream of ours to make a movie together. But the budget had grown out of control, the endless reshoots, and now our lead actress was hurt. With every passing moment the dream felt just a little bit further away. 

A few minutes passed and my thoughts were interrupted by the sounds of squealing tires as we lurched to a stop. A massive object slammed into the windshield and fell to the ground in front of the car. I couldn’t believe my eyes, Mr. Jackknife was laying face down in a heap in the middle of the road. Blood and slime was splattered everywhere.

We sat in silence, failing to understand what was happening. The car’s windshield was cracked and a side mirror dangled from its wires.  Mr. Jackknife slowly stood up, using his awkwardly long arms to pull himself up the road’s guard rail. He began walking again, his legs buckling and shaking like a newborn deer. Without so much as turning around, he continued walking the way he was heading. 

Our pursuit of the puppet was slow going, the car crawling behind him as he took each shaky step forward. Eventually, Mr. Jackknife took a hard turn off of the road, down a long gravel driveway, and towards a large industrial building. It looked like it was long abandoned, with overgrown vegetation and boards across the windows. 

Clark stopped the car and turned the headlights off. We waited under the cover of darkness to see what would happen. As the puppet approached the door, several puppeteers burst out and began to drag Mr. Jackknife through the threshold. 

There were at least ten of them. They all looked identical to the two that worked on our set. They worked quickly, piloting Mr. Jackknife through the door and out of sight.

“Shit, they probably have Michelle in there, should we find a phone and call someone?” Clark didn’t take his eyes off of the door as he spoke. Glancing up at the rearview mirror, he froze. 

Looking behind me, there were several puppeteers hiding in the woods behind us, their eyes glowing like a cat's in the moonlight. We had slowly crawled up the driveway and hadn’t realized how far we had come. Suddenly a shadow appeared next to the driver’s side window. A puppeteer had silently moved right next to us, and I watched as the other pairs of eyes in the distance drew closer. 

The puppeteer by the window wound up a punch and swung wildly at the window. As soon as its fist made contact, it exploded into a shower of blood. It appeared to have no bones, just skin, flesh and blood. I whipped around as another slammed its head into my window, causing it to crack. When it pulled its head from the window it had a gaping crater where the top half of its face used to be.

Soon, dozens of them had set upon the car. The roof was filled with dents as blood poured down the windows from above. They kicked the windows until their feet fell off and they were kicking with nothing but stumps. It didn’t take long for them to break the windows and reach in. The broken glass shredded their limbs into ribbons, but they didn’t stop grabbing. I kicked the car door open hard, caving in the chest of a puppeteer. I tried to make a run for it but was tackled to the ground. One of the horrible clones started to beat me, its fingers breaking off against my chest. I reached out in self defense and its face pulled off in one swift motion. I was able to escape the now eyeless creature as it felt around blindly in the grass.

As I ran I turned back to see the car completely covered in viscera and thrashing bodies. Clark was still inside somewhere. If I turned back now, I would be overrun by the puppeteers and killed. They were fragile enough to deal with alone, but if I was overrun by multiple of them I would have no chance of survival. I reached the door Mr. Jackknife had gone through and tugged at the handle. It was locked. My attempts to be quiet were foiled by crunching leaves as I circled the building's perimeter.

I reached a window and began tugging at the boards covering it. The first board released, clattering to the ground. I quickly checked behind myself to find the puppeteers were still busy with the car. The next board came loose. I turned around again. This time all of the puppeteers stood completely still, their broken bodies still dripping with blood. I heard footsteps behind me as I pulled the last board off with a tug and leapt through the window frame.

The room inside descended much further underground than I anticipated, and I tumbled down and crashed through a large cot. Pain shot through my shoulder as I stood up. The now broken cot looked like one from a hospital. As I squinted in the darkness I noticed several other identical beds scattered around the room. I slowly crept through the room, noticing that there were several unmoving puppeteers laid in some of the beds. Some of them were connected to IV drips that were filled with blood. Some of them moved their limbs or thrashed their heads back and forth. Others simply followed me with their eyes as I passed by. 

The door at the end of the room I was heading to swung open, causing me to take cover underneath a cot. In the darkness I recognized Steven. He was wearing a blood stained white coat over his button up and khaki pants. He started inspecting the cot that I had broken and noticed that the window above was no longer boarded. A flashlight clicked on and he began to search the room, the light stopping to inspect each bed. As I watched, I tried to decide my course of action. I could try to disable Steven, but if the puppets woke up I would be overrun. I resolved to try to find Michelle before anything found me. I pressed forward, hoping to make it to the door before I was discovered. I moved through the room on my stomach, trying my best to stifle the sounds of pain I wanted to make due to my aching shoulder. As I reached for the door handle, I was suddenly illuminated by the beam of the flashlight.

“Stop it, Robert. You’ve seen enough of this closet’s skeletons, I fear.” Steven made his way toward me as I sat paralyzed in fear. “You won’t make it out there. They are well trained to deal with outsiders.”

“Steven, I-I don’t understand man. Listen, I just want to take Michelle and Clark and go home, I don’t understand any of this.” 

Steven stared at me with an expression of pure apathy. “I wouldn’t expect you to understand, Robert, but you should have never come here. The affairs that take place under this roof are not only private, but sacred.” 

“The puppet, he was walking down the street.” I was desperate to understand. It all felt unreal, like I was trapped in a waking nightmare.

“I felt terrible having him make the journey on his own, but the situation called for it. I never intended for you to find out about this place. When Mr. Jackknife got a taste for blood, it forced my hand to action.”

The door slammed open, and pushing through it was a giant mass of body parts. It looked like several of the puppeteers had all been melted together. It drug itself forward with its many arms and legs, and its heads all frantically looked in different directions. 

“Gently now, take him to a donation chair, please.” Following orders, the hulking beast wrapped me in a bundle of squirming arms. They felt incredibly smooth and soft, like the skin of a newborn. I found myself unable to struggle as I was dragged through the doors and out of the room. As we passed through the corridor, I saw rows and rows of giant human shaped molds. Some were empty, and others were closed, with latex dripping from the cracks in between the two halves.

In the next room, there were lines of chairs with shackles for the hands and feet. I began to struggle harder, and as I thrashed and tore at the monster's body it began to leak blood and let out groans of misery. I was thrown into a chair, and the monsters' many hands made light work of my bindings. It then turned around, and exited from where it came. 

I waited several minutes in the chair, my hands quivering in pure terror as I imagined what would happen next. Sweat rolled down my forehead, stinging my eyes with no hands to wipe them. Then the doors opened again. I shouted in pure terror, an animalistic guttural scream of pure agony. 

Crossing the threshold was Mr. Jackknife himself. He was being guided by two puppeteers, like an old lady being helped across the street. They released his arms and he began to lumber towards me with shaking footsteps.

The puppet had looked impressively realistic before, but this was different. Mr. Jackknife’s beady eyes rolled around in different directions in the flesh mound underneath his hat. Saliva bubbled in the small slit where a mouth should be. The shivering mass under the trenchcoat dripped with mucus and pulsated with an irregular heartbeat. In a few unsteady strides, he was right in front of me. He smelled like spoiled meat. I wretched and closed my eyes. I could feel his hot breath against my face as he took shallow, wheezing breaths. I listened with my eyes still shut tightly as he dislodged a blade from his body. He groaned in pain and the blade escaped with a sickening pop. 

My eyes shot open as the blade was drug down my forearm to my wrist. Blood began to pour out as I tried desperately to stay conscious. Mr. Jackknife lowered his massive head to my arm and began to feed. I flailed and panicked in a desperate attempt to escape, but the shackles restricted my every movement. 

The puppet’s feeding was interrupted by a push that caused him to topple to the ground. Michelle leapt onto the creature and began pulling a blade from his body. She twisted and shook the blade until blood ran down her palms and it came loose. She was like an animal, viciously stabbing Mr. Jackknife over and over again. She moved from his body to his head, putting out an eye with her frantic stabbing. Mr. Jackknife swung an arm and knocked Michelle off of him. He had bloody tears running down his face. He crawled through the metal doors where he had come from and disappeared down the hall.

She looked incredibly pale and her wound was still open and bleeding. I began to cry from pure relief as she undid my restraints. She smiled weakly and handed me my blood covered overshirt, gesturing to my gushing arm.

“You look like you need it just as much as me.” I pointed to her wounded head. 

“I’m alright, let’s get to a hospital,” Michelle responded, her smile failing to conceal her pain.

“We need to get Clark, he’s out in the car… I hope.”

We made our way back through the corridor. All of the puppets stood completely still, unmoving and waiting for orders. Laying just a few steps past the doorway was Mr. Jackknife collapsed in a pool of blood. Steven kneeled over him, his hand clutching a bleeding wound on his stomach. Tears rolled down his cheeks. His face was pale and his eyes fluttered, as if calling him closer and closer towards eternal sleep. 

“It’s a shame really, how all of this turned out. I wish I wouldn’t have had to cause so much pain.” Steven was speaking to nobody in particular, caressing the head of the deceased. A coughing fit ensued that sounded like it was dragging Steven closer and closer to hell. 

“He stabbed you, didn’t he?” I asked, anger in my voice. “Bet you never wanted any of these monsters feeding on *your* blood?”

“He hugged me, Robert,” Steven said, choking back another onslaught of tears. “He chose me over himself. Isn’t that beautiful? It’s a wonderful feeling, to be loved. He never knew he was anything but a normal man.”

I started towards the exit, with Michelle right behind me. After the door closed, the sound of sobs echoed from the inside. I walked toward the car, my head spinning. The car sat lonely at the end of the gravel drive now, covered in blood and dented beyond conceivable repair. I opened the driver's side door and confronted the truth. Clark was dead. We had promised to make a film together, and that promise had killed him. The spoils of all of our efforts reduced to blood and flesh. 

I moved him from the driver’s seat, and laid him down in the back. I left my dream back there with him. I could make a film someday, but I could never make a film with him. Before I knew it I had begun to sob. The world turned into smears of light in my eyes. Michelle was turned away, looking out the window. In her reflection, I saw tears running down her cheeks.

The car started with a groan. Both of the headlights had been destroyed, and I made my way down the drive in the pitch blackness. The drive gave way to the freedom of the road, and we plunged into the darkness together.

(I know that's personal, but if I don't particularly sound neurodivergent then I don't want to waste anyone's time)","I want to run some things by actual people before taking this to a mental health professional. I also want to state up front that I understand ChatGPT is NOT diagnostic, does not replace a clinician, isn't accurate, and that AI has some severe limitations that are the least of the worries with AI. But I'm not here to discuss the validities of AI, I want to discuss with actual people some of the things it told me (which I guess is talking about the validity of AI, but I'm not saying ChatGPT has diagnosed me, just it's given me a lot to think about and I wanna discuss with real people before potentially wasting time/money with a clinician because.... AI lol).

I apologize beforehand because this will probably be long, but I'm trying to give information and be kind of thorough with this? I thank anyone that hangs in there until the end!

So, I am assigned female at birth but began transitioning at age 31. My pronouns are he/him which is what one would assume if you just saw me at the store or whatever. I potentially have dyscalculia (not severe, it's more of a possible procedural dyscalculia), I think I might have started reading at 3? I consistently read above grade level in school. I was a ""gifted"" child, excelling in everything unless it involved math lol. I was perceived by others as ""shy"" but I never felt shy. I just didn't have anything to say or needed to see what was going on and how things worked before joining. I preferred talking with teachers, but I did have a few friends my own age. My friend group was never very large, I think like 4 people tops. Looking back, a lot of friends from both childhood and adulthood are neurodivergent. I don't know how true that ""birds of a feather"" thing is, but if I'm not like best friends with someone that's neurodivergent they're at least my friend (I don't hang out with all of them because a lot of them don't live by me, but they are people I consider friends).

This is where we're really in it for the long haul, so I apologize ahead of time. The horribly long list of traits.

As a child, I had a favorite movie (still a favorite) and I watched it so many times my mom said the VHS cassette broke. Years later I told her I thought she was lying just to get me to stop watching it, but she maintains to this day that it broke.

I loved rice as a child, always asking for it and I still love rice as an adult. I absolutely did not like foods mixing as a child. Mexican food was a hard no. I ate only plain hamburgers for years before allowing just pickles on them. Jelly/jam was an absolute no. I still can't do a lot of jelly/jam but today I can handle a small amount. The texture of oatmeal makes me feel nauseous. 

I abhor the smell of canned tuna as well as coffee (I'm sorry!) and as a kid the feeling of hot coffee in a Styrofoam cup grossed me out. 

I didn't like the seam on my socks over my pinky toe and had a way to fold my socks over so the seam wasn't bothersome. 

I played pretend for a long time, having very elaborate day dreams well into my late twenties. 

When I first started showering, something about the soap and water on my face was enough that I would roll up a washcloth and put it across my forehead or over my eyes to keep the shampoo/water out. I don't do this anymore, but it was an absolute necessity for years. I also didn't understand like, scrubbing the shampoo out with my fingers? I would just stand under the shower and let the water do it, which I had long hair and honestly didn't go very well. This also went on for a few years and I really don't know why.

When I was very little, I was messing around with one of those Ace bandages (the stretchy ones for like sprained ankles or whatever). I rubbed it back and forth across my neck until I rubbed all the skin off my neck. Around that same age, I did the same thing with a washcloth and the skin on my nose, washing my face.

I don't like disruptions (but who does?) and have a problem at work where I just can't work on something for 5 minutes here and a few minutes there as the day allows. I deeply want to work on that one task and finish it. I get interrupted all the time and I think I can pick back up where I left off, I just mostly find it jarring.

Something I do think ChatGPT was wrong about but I want to discuss it with other people is autistic social fatigue. When I hit adolescence, I began having what was diagnosed as ""anxiety"" when I was with my friends. The situation would be I'd be at a movie with my friends, something that I had previously done with no problems, and at some point during the movie I felt nauseous. Like wondering if I needed to get up and leave nauseous. Didn't matter the movie. I'd sit still, determining if I needed to leave, but eventually it would pass. My mom would have me invite a friend on a weekend trip with us and it would happen there too. At some point, I would have this intense nausea episode and eventually it would pass. It made me not want to have friends on trips. I was lucky enough to be a People to People Student Ambassador in high school and my mom didn't want me having one of these episodes and took me to the doctor. I was diagnosed with anxiety and put on Paxil and those episodes stopped for the most part.

Since then, I have been on Citalopram, which worked the same amount, I was on Bupropion at the same time as Citalopram and felt AMAZING for the r first 3 days and then I don't know that it really did anything for me after that. I stayed on it for several years before I quit because I was too busy to pick up my refill and had way too much Citalopram. My grandma passed away last year and I began having some more severe emotional problems, feeling very volatile and having a hard time and I was put on Duloxetine. For the first time in years, I feel like I understand what being calm must feel like. I used to pace around the house every morning, ruminating like mad, and I can actually sit on the couch in the morning now and just chill. It's wild.

I had and still have interests that others have described as ""obsessive"". Occasionally I've been told to stop talking about whatever it is I'm going on about. I don't think anything I was into was bizarre necessarily, but the amount I was into it was a lot more than the other kids. If we had free computer time, everyone else would play games and I would look up information about jousting. 

I wasn't very concerned about fitting in as a kid. And I didn't fit in. 

People sometimes thought I wasn't paying attention or that I didn't speak English when I was in group settings with strangers. I've even been asked where I grew up because apparently I speak differently than other people where I live? I've been here my whole life! 

To try and wrap this up, is it possible that I flew under the radar because I didn't cause problems and generally did well? Other than the social fatigue, a lot of things really resonated with me to the point it's concerning but I don't know if there really is a chance I'm on the autism spectrum. I'm super appreciative of any insights people have, and of course I can clear up anything (I'm trying to get this typed out on the way to our mobile clinic for work). Thank you SO MUCH! I really appreciate everyone! ",1,1763478989.0,neurodiversity,2,1.0,False

Prompt: Write a short story about a deal with the djinn gone awry


Output:



Arthur Penhaligon was a man who treated life like a deposition. He did not like surprises. He did not like ambiguity. Most of all, he did not like the crushing pressure of the passing second.

When he found the brass canister at an estate sale—tarnished, heavy, and smelling faintly of ozone—he didn't rub it by accident. He rubbed it after researching Semitic folklore for three weeks and donning a hazmat suit in his basement.

The smoke that poured out was not blue, but a dirty, industrial grey. It coalesced into a figure that looked less like a muscular giant and more like a bored, weary accountant in a vest of smoke.

""I am Ifrit,"" the spirit sighed, looking at its fingernails, which were made of soot. ""Three wishes. Standard rules. No killing, no love, no resurrection. And please, be quick. I have a poker game in the ether at six.""

Arthur slammed a binder onto the table. ""I have prepared a contract.""

The Djinn blinked. ""A what?""

""A binding agreement regarding the terms of the first wish. I am a contract lawyer, you see. I know how you lot operate. 'I want to fly' turns into being flung from a catapult. 'I want to be rich' turns into a life insurance payout for a dead spouse. None of that.""

The Djinn floated closer, squinting at the document. ""Clause 1.a: The Beneficiary shall receive the ability to manipulate temporal perception..."" He looked up. ""You want to stop time?""

""Precise wording, please,"" Arthur snapped. ""I want the ability to 'pause' the external world at will. While paused, I will not age, I will not require sustenance, and I will not suffer physical fatigue. I will retain full mobility and cognitive function. The pause will only end when I have fully formulated the perfect response or action to the situation at hand.""

Arthur smiled a thin, triumphant smile. He suffered from crippling anxiety. He spent hours lying awake at night regretting that he had said ""You too"" when a waiter told him to enjoy his meal. This was the ultimate cure. Infinite time to think. Infinite time to be perfect.

The Djinn shrugged. ""Bit verbose, but doable. You sure about the termination clause? 'When you have fully formulated the perfect response'?""

""I am never sure of anything until I have thought about it for at least an hour. That is the point. Do we have a deal?""

The Djinn signed the air with a smoky finger. ""Done. Enjoy the silence."" With a pop that sounded like a lightbulb breaking, the Djinn vanished.

Arthur stood alone in his basement. He tested it. He thought, *Pause.*

The dust motes dancing in the beam of the basement window froze. The hum of the refrigerator cut out instantly. Silence, thick and heavy, descended. Arthur walked around the room, adjusted his tie, checked his notes, and took a deep breath. He felt calm. He thought, *Resume.*

The hum returned. The dust continued its dance. Perfection.

Arthur went to work the next day with a stride in his step. He was ready to conquer the world.

His first test came at 9:05 AM at the local coffee shop. The barista, a young woman with green hair and a piercing gaze, looked at him over the register.

""Room for cream?"" she asked.

It was a binary question. Yes or no. But Arthur felt that familiar spike of panic. If he said yes, he seemed indulgent. If he said no, the coffee might be too bitter, and he’d grimace, and she’d think he was weak.

*Pause.*

The world slammed to a halt. The steam rising from the espresso machine froze into a jagged sculpture of gray cloud. The barista’s blink was arrested halfway, one eye slightly more closed than the other. The noise of the grinder died instantly.

Arthur exhaled. He had all the time in the world.

He stepped out of the line and walked around the frozen café. He inspected the pastries. He looked at the barista's nametag: *Chloe*. He walked to the window and watched a pigeon suspended in mid-flap over the sidewalk.

*Okay,* Arthur thought. *Analyze. Room for cream. If I take cream, the coffee cools down faster. Thermodynamics. But the mouthfeel is superior. However, I’m wearing a white shirt. Increased viscosity might lead to a higher probability of a stain if I spill.*

He paced the coffee shop for what felt like an hour. He drafted a mental pros-and-cons list.

*Option A: No room. Black coffee. Pros: Masculine, caloric efficiency, maximum heat retention. Cons: Potential bitterness, acid reflux.*

*Option B: Room for cream. Pros: Flavor profile complexity, calcium. Cons: Dilution of caffeine.*

He sat in a booth and put his feet up. This was amazing. No pressure. No rush.

After three ""hours"" of subjective time, Arthur decided. He would take it black. It was the power move. It showed efficiency.

He stood in front of the frozen Chloe, cleared his throat, and prepared to speak. He focused his mind on the intent to unpause.

*Resume,* he commanded mentally.

Nothing happened.

The steam remained frozen. Chloe remained blinking. The pigeon outside hung in the air like a bad special effect.

Arthur frowned. *Resume,* he thought harder. *I have decided. The answer is 'No, thank you, black is fine.'*

Still, the world did not move.

A cold spike of dread, sharper than the coffee shop air, pierced his chest. He thought back to the contract. *The pause will only end when I have fully formulated the perfect response.*

""I have it,"" Arthur said aloud. His voice died instantly in the sound-dampened air. ""The answer is no.""

But then, a small voice in the back of his head whispered: *Is it perfectly formulated, though?*

Arthur hesitated. *If I say ""No, thank you,"" is that too formal? Does it make me sound stiff? Maybe just a casual ""Nah, I'm good."" But ""Nah"" is dismissive. She's in the service industry; she deserves respect. What about ""Black, please""? concise, but potentially rude.*

The Djinn hadn't tricked him with the magic. The magic was working exactly as requested. It was waiting for the *perfect* response.

And Arthur Penhaligon was a man who did not believe in perfection.

He began to pace again. He spent a day—subjectively—analyzing the tone of voice he should use. Should he smile? A smile might be misinterpreted as flirting. A frown was too aggressive. A neutral expression? Sociopathic.

He spent a week debating the sociological implications of milk in coffee.

He spent a month wondering if he should order tea instead, but realized that would require unpausing to change the order, which he couldn't do until he finished answering the current question.

*Just say no!* he screamed internally. *Just unpause!*

But the magic knew him better than he knew himself. Deep down, Arthur wasn't 100% sure. There was a 0.01% doubt. What if the coffee was burnt? Cream would salvage it. If he committed to black, he was stuck with it. Was that *perfect*? No.

Years passed in the silence of the coffee shop.

Arthur went mad, then got bored, then got sane again, then went mad a second time. He read every magazine on the rack a thousand times. He learned to juggle frozen muffins. He memorized the number of threads in Chloe’s apron.

He didn't age. He didn't get tired. He just thought.

He overthought.

Eventually, Arthur stopped trying to answer the question. He sat on the floor in the lotus position, staring at the suspended droplet of condensed milk on the tip of the steam wand.

He realized, with the terrifying clarity of a man with eternity on his hands, that as long as he was capable of doubt, he was capable of improvement. And as long as improvement was possible, the response wasn't *perfect*.

The Djinn had been right to look bored. He knew the trap wasn't in the wording.

The trap was the wisher.

In the eternal, silent twilight of 9:05 AM, Arthur Penhaligon sat and thought, and thought, and thought, waiting for a certainty that would never come.",3,1763478967.0,Bard,2,1.0,False

[How to Start an OnlyFans - a guide : u/Drewandelena](https://www.reddit.com/user/Drewandelena/comments/vmrbvb/comment/ie2oinb/?context=3)

A lot of people have their opinions about OnlyFans and most of them are coming from people with no experience or understanding about content creation and spread information that is just.. wrong .

As someone who has been making content for OnlyFans for over a year , has met countless other content creators in real life along with talking to hundreds and hundreds more , even helping a lot of them get their own accounts started I figured it best to put a lot of that information on here for others to learn from

Skeptics of OF don’t understand why people will pay money for something they can get for free. Yes you can get better quality porn for free almost anywhere . But there have been a lot of recent articles that say behaviors and interests in porn along with most entertainment are changing which has led to content creation and the increasing popularity of it . People want more than to watch scripted scenarios as a voyeur with no connection to the material . They want interaction and customization and connection .

Fans sign up for content , they stay for the personality . Being real and enjoying making content and interacting with fans is crucial to have any success . Fans can tell when people are doing something they don’t enjoy in order to sell content or fit a niche and it’s a turn off . You have to be yourself . Creators shouldn’t be attempting to find some niche that will make them successful . It’s all been done before and probably been done better . The niche is YOU . There’s only one you with your personality and quirks and interests and personality. Subscribers stay because they like who you are and how you present your content and how you treat them .

What OnlyFans allows is a peek behind the curtain at the person’s every day life . Most creators will offer custom content , sexting , phone or video chat and a great deal of content. But what keeps people returning month after month is the authenticity of the experience . I can post an explicit 30 minute video of me and another woman and man and people will like it but often it’s a photo of me having a cup of coffee at the park walking the dog that gets more attention and likes and tips. The interaction and revealing your true self to fans is something that free porn will never be able to compete with and it’s why OnlyFans and sites like it continue to grow and will continue to grow .

The great thing about OnlyFans and content creation is you CAN be a success regardless of age, gender, body type, and the content you sell. Men can be as successful as women. Older moms can be as successful as younger model types . You can be as successful posting pics of yourself shirtless as you can doing explicit content . It comes down to your personality . I know middle aged dad bod types who do fun things like mow their lawns shirtless or grill with their butt crack showing but they’re fun and jovial and their personality shines and they make 5 figures a month . There are women who don’t even show explicit sex who are making high six figures a year . These are normal everyday people . They’re your neighbors , your co workers, your friends at church . It’s everyday people who are having the most success as they’re relatable .

But again the key is your personality and authenticity . If you don’t like showing off and if you don’t like interacting with fans you aren’t going to do well. People see right through the fakery and maybe you can make some money initially through curious people but the fans won’t come back . You have to enjoy showing yourself off and you have to like interacting with fans . If not there’s no reason to put yourself out there because the results won’t be worth the angst you feel.

The biggest component of becoming a success on OnlyFans is how much time you have to devote to it . Making the content and interacting on your page is a small percent being a creator . The most successful creators are spending 4-6 hours a day just on marketing . And it’s not about spamming your link and the same pic over and over 100 times a day . There are millions of people that want to subscribe . But you won’t convince someone to subscribe by pushing your link . It shows a robotic like manipulation and it’s a turn off and gives creators a bad name . Spammers don’t last and they don’t make money . The process just repeats itself because those that don’t know any better continue to spam when they start thinking it’s the best way to be successful and it’s the exact opposite . Every single content creator needs to familiarize themselves with [r/onlyfansadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/onlyfansadvice/) Its the most informative useful subreddit for creators .

The two most successful sites to gain subscribers are Tik Tok and Instagram. Neither site allows links or explicit content . The same with Chive- another great site . It’s because you are getting your fans because these subscribers love your personality . If you are out making fun videos and commenting and interacting with people they will see this and want to know more about you . They’ll find your OF links and seek them out because of how you interact and present yourself on other sites . It’s why it’s so important to be on many different platforms from Tik Tok to Reddit to Twitter to Porn Hub and present new content and new teases every day , several times a day and interact with those who comment and reach out .

It doesn’t matter how amazing you are and how great your only fans is if no one knows it exists . So if you’re looking to be successful you have to have the time to market consistently to people . And again you have to enjoy posting and enjoy interacting with people . Im not the biggest or best creator out there but I am proud of the fact that while most creators average a 25/30% subscriber retention rate and 50% is considered really really good that I typically maintain 68-78% retention . It means I know they love what I’m putting out and how I engage them . It also helps me have more time to spend with them and less time trying to constantly market and replace expiring subscribers

Some pointers

1- Be consistent . I post 4-5 times a day, every day. Subscribers know that in addition to the library of content already on the page that they will get new content several times a day, each and every day . They know the value of content they’re getting just for that subscription price . You don’t have to post that much. You don’t even need to post daily . But you should maintain a schedule and have some back up content should you need a mental break or get sick or just generally can’t create something new . A huge complaint from subscribers who talk about their experiences is lack of consistency and creators not being open about their content

2- Give them content worthy of the subscription . If you post 5 different video clips online for free and 10 different pics each day for free you need to do even more on your paid page . I enjoy sharing short video clips online . They’re generally 40-50 seconds and I post 4-5 a week . On my onlyfans they get the uncensored longer versions with most videos running 3-8 minutes each , sometimes I post full length vids and for subscribers who rebill they get extra bonus content on top of it. If you only post topless on onlyfans don’t post topless on other sites for free . Make it special for your fans . Those who subscribe to my page realize that my Reddit and twitter content looks like Disney compared to what my premium page features haha",1,1763478965.0,MarianneTipton,0,1.0,False

1p0e9hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1p0e9hm/sudden_visual_impairment_of_left_eye/,Sudden visual impairment of left eye,"Hello everyone,

last friday I (f, 30) had very strong headaches, which only got a bit better over the course of the day after two ibuprofen and lots of coffee. Since that day, the vision in my left eye is a little more blurry. It feels like there is some kind of gunk in the eye — something you would normally want to rub out — but you can’t rub it away. So I always see somewhat fuzzy.

I don’t know whether the headache is related, but since they happened on the same day, and I didn’t have any headaches in the days or weeks before, I mention this just in case.

Three days later I went to my general practitioner. He only told me I don’t have conjunctivitis and a normal blood pressure and said I should next go to an ophthalmologist, and if they find nothing, then to a neurologist.

I went to the ophthalmologist the same day. He did a vision test and also some kind of test where i had to press a button If I see any kind of light in my visual field . After that he sent me home again, because my visual acuity is good. But I definitely see more blurred / less sharply with my left eye. Apparently, though, it is still good enough to be classified as “perfect vision” or “perfect visual acuity.”

That is the current situation. I haven’t done anything more yet, because I do see blurry, but my ophthalmologist says my acuity is normal. I feel like today it’s become a little worse again. It’s as though there is a very light veil over my eye. I don’t know what I should do now.

Some more information: I used to have problems with high blood pressure, and back in 2007 I had an incident where they weren’t sure whether it was a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or migraine. The MRI (they did an MRI scan) later showed some mild scarring on my brain. (But no multiple sclerosis, they checked 6 months later).

What would be the best thing to do now? I’m a little afraid that this will not go away, or that it will get worse, or that there might be something more serious behind it.

Update: I forgot to mention, I also have a slight pain in the eye If I press against it in a certain angle. It’s there, but not intense. I noticed this, when I removed my eye make up.",1,1763478277.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I was never the favorite growing up. There’s 3 of us. Me, my brother, and my sister. Im the oldest, followed by my brother, and then my sister. There was another sister (who was 2 years younger than me), but she sadly passed from SIDS. When we were little, my mom did EVERYTHING for my sister. Put her in dance classes, spoiled her, etc. Me? Never. Like EVER. I was lucky they even paid for my choir uniform for school. My brother was kinda just in between. But things got different as we got older.

As I mentioned above, I was never the favorite. In fact, im probably the biggest problem in my family’s life. My mom always talks about how she can’t ever talk to me because of how I take things, im over sensitive, etc. (I have BPD and was abused as a kid, so go figure right?). Goes on about how she doesn’t “need” me at home. Only talks to me when it benefits her. For example : Her insurance got cut off and as a result she wasn’t going to get her diabetic medication. Well, I was still getting mine even though I didn’t need that dose anymore, and she was all up my ass trying to get my meds. She was buying me coffee, actually texting me, etc. However, once my brother’s gf offered to get her meds at a discounted price, she realized she didn’t need me anymore and everything stopped quickly. Same thing happened with this Walmart trip. She invited me to Walmart, saying she really wanted me to go. But why? Because my brother went off with his gf, and I know my mom doesn’t like to shop alone…so really I was just there so SHE wouldn’t be lonely. (And before yall say, “she could’ve asked your sister”, my sister moved out and lives roughly 4 hours away).

I also want to point out my mom treats me differently every time people are around. I had Bariatric surgery a year ago, and as a result, dumping syndrome is a thing. Imagine your mom talking about how bad your shit stinks to someone you BARELY know (my brothers gf). And when I say BARELY I mean fucking BARELY. Idk shit about her. Neither does my mom really.

My mom plans everything around my brother and his gf, it’s gotten annoying. She’s going to universal with them, planning to do a Disney cruise with them. Did she invite me? Yeah. But when I asked her if we could plan a later date so I could save a bit more, she didn’t even consider it, because it’s all about my brother and his gf.

Not to mention my brother’s gf is kinda a kiss ass. Buying my mom expensive bags, doing all this shit for her…im curious to know where she gets her money considering she’s still in school for her nursing degree. Yeah she works in a hospital, but she’s not even a RN. Maybe her parents help her out idk.

But anyway, let’s get back to the main point. So I already told you my mom treats me different around ppl right? Well it only got worse AFTER my brother’s gf moved in. Two things rubbed me wrong about that. 1) no one ever told me this girl was moving in. Not even my brother. So I get hit with this maybe a week before it actually happened. And 2) before my brother even MET this girl, my mom strictly said, “no more partners living in the house”. Mainly cuz of all the drama with past relationships. All of us agreed. Yet here we are…ANOTHER PARTNER IN THE HOUSE

This girl, who literally never says a word to any of us really, and only ever comes out the room when my brother is home, is pregnant. She hasn’t even been living with us for a full month yet, and she’s already fucking pregnant. The level of anxiety I have is insane.

Am I worried about me? No. I’m worried about my son and history repeating itself. My grandma had a favorite - me. I saw how it affected my cousins, and I hated it. Why was I the favorite? Cuz I was my mom’s kid. My mom was her favorite. And I was a girl.

Now my brother is my mom’s favorite. He’s 24, has a decent job, etc…yet she still gets everything for him. I’m a SAHM, have no income, have an autistic child who might be on disability soon, and am trying my best, and she doesn’t help me with shit. Can’t even watch my son for 40 mins for me to go pick up dinner. If you ask me, I do think she’d do everything for my brother’s kid, and wouldn’t for mine.

So yeah, im scared. Not so much for myself…idc if she hates me or whatever…but the fact my son is most likely gonna be treated like he’s not good enough simply because im his mother is eating me up inside. I can’t talk to her cuz she’ll insult me and just say im wrong, when I in fact know im not (many others have seen it too). I just don’t know what to do. I have nothing against this girl, but I kinda hate her for moving in now and getting pregnant. I can’t even be happy for my own brother simply because of my mother…

So I ask you all, am I the asshole for not wanting my brother to have this baby? What can I do to maybe help the situation? I’m really considering moving out…",1,1763478266.0,AITAH,12,1.0,False

The issue is prednisone is like my nightmare drug- the anxiety I get from it is like I downed a pot of coffee. I can’t sleep on it, I can’t eat, I can’t relax. I told my doctor this and he knows, because I’ve expressed throughly in the past unless it’s a medical necessity and we have no other options I never ever want to take this drug again.

And he told me today, I have to take this. I mean I can choose not to but the consequences on my health with me severe. So I know I need to buck up and take it and just get through it- it won’t kill me, but for the love of god I hate this medication. I literally hate it so much. 

My mental health is at all time low too given the fact I had sertonin toxicity and was in the icu and told I can’t ever take an ssri or snri again- so all I got for me is my benzo if I need it and propranolol. I’m praying to god it’s not so bad this time.

I became restless and jittery but by 12:50 I felt fine and tired like I was coming down. 1:00 hits and I CRASH my body starts having a panic attack because I felt the caffeine symptoms kick in and it reminded me of what happened when I smoked weed for the first time tingling everywhere, I get overheated, frequent peeing, i feel restless and there’s jitters everywhere like uncontrollable, weird taste in my mouth along w tingles,  I get lightheaded dizzy n feel nauseous. I went to wake up my mum and talking to her helped ground me thankfully so we go downstairs to make me cereal and I js panic n I get lightheaded again n I feel like I’m gna faint but I don’t. My mum turns the sofa into a bed so I go to lie down n eat my cereal n keep drinking water and all of a sudden I feel really weak and cold (by this point it’s like 2:15) then I start to overheat again and I feel a lot better just tired but my anxiety was still raised so it was hard for me to sleep and eventually at 5:30AM I fell asleep. I wake up and fall back asleep multiple times and eventually at 6:30 I wake up n try to distract myself (keep in mind this is the same day as the panic attack) 7:30 comes n I get more aware of my body sensations and anxiety so we go to bed early. I sleep in by myself and try to relax and my body does but my mind won’t shut off n as soon as I feel my mind slipping away I wake up. This happens again so eventually at 9pm I go to sleep w my mum. By this point I’m exhausted but I CANNOT SLEEP my body’s exhausted and I can feel it falling asleep but my mind won’t. It starts a pattern of try to sleep for an hour, wake up bc anxiety, try sleep again my body was js begging for sleep. I go back to my own bed and one thing I kept feeling was really slow and light headed like my movements had a floaty or bouncy feel which made my anxiety worse and my vision started going weird n I kept overheating so I woke up my mum and laid in the bathroom I js didn’t feel real like everything felt light and airy and I knew I needed sleep I js couldn’t in my bed. I had sum hot milk from my mum and sum food, we go downstairs and I lay on the sofa while she gets ready for work (it’s 3AM today) I eat sum crisps have a yogurt n sum water, I stay up for a bit bc of that floaty feeling giving me anxiety but I ended up closing my eyes and drifting to sleep. I wake up at 10:30, I I felt RLLY good at first like I felt active n I was laughing but then at abt 12:00 I felt way more lightheaded and floaty again also brain fog and tiredness, mum came home at 1:30 and talking to her felt like it required a lot of focus n whne we spoke i felt lightheaded n zoning out which made me freak out. It’s 3PM now i feel tired n kinda heavy, floaty, brain fog, hard to focus, and my anxiety’s still there, all my feelings get worse with anxiety. I had a tiny panic and afterwards my body started shivering, i js feel like times slipping n I get rlly slow which makes me worry even more bc it doenst feel normal. I just want to know what’s gonna happen to me/what HAS happened to me, am I okay, and what should I do?",1,1763478056.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

1p0e4wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1p0e4wl/yet_another_cloudflare_outage/,Yet Another Cloudflare Outage,"On Tuesday, The Internet Went Down. Again. And Yes, It Was Us. Again.

On Tuesday at approximately 09:14 UTC, vast portions of the Internet—some would say “a concerning percentage of humanity’s connection to civilization”—began returning ERR_CONNECTION_CLOUDFLARED. After an intensive internal investigation lasting roughly the length of a coffee refill, we determined the root cause: Cloudflare, once again, expertly disrupting Cloudflare, via Cloudflare, because Cloudflare.

Unlike prior incidents—which were merely catastrophic—this outage persisted for several hours, causing notable disruptions to businesses, governments, and at least one extremely upset Twitch streamer. Our teams worked tirelessly, frantically, and in some cases reflexively hitting Enter on “rollback” commands until the Internet reassembled itself.

We want to reassure customers that no customer data was lost in this outage, though all of your traffic was very, very unavailable. But legally, those are different things, and we’ve been told we’re allowed to emphasize that.

This is unfortunately only the latest of multiple large-scale outages this year, each one somehow more creatively inconvenient than the last. We know this is beginning to feel less like isolated incidents and more like a seasonal subscription service to Internet chaos. We hear you. We, too, would like to unsubscribe.


---

The key to mitigating this week’s Internet collapse?

Early detection—specifically:

“WHY IS MY WEBSITE DOWN?!” appearing as a trending topic on Twitter

PagerDuty alerts forming a continuous, unbroken tone

A live heatmap of the outage expanding faster than our engineers could swear about it


We identified that the outage originated from a configuration push made with full Cloudflare privileges directly into Cloudflare’s global network—proving once again that the most dangerous threat actor to Cloudflare is, in fact, Cloudflare.

Using our Zero Trust Access, Gateway, DLP, and the sacred practice of “frantically undoing whatever we just did,” we validated the scope of the incident and contained it… eventually. Like, hours later. But still “rapid” if you compare it to geological time.


---

Recommendations for Cloudflare

Given the frequency of these outages, we strongly urge Cloudflare to consider implementing the following best practices:

Stop deploying anything on Thursdays. And also Wednesdays. And maybe just… weekdays.

Mandatory caffeine intake before all production actions. Enforcement remains a challenge.

Firewalls preventing anyone from touching production unless 3 unrelated adults agree they are emotionally stable.

Introduce staging environments that actually resemble production, instead of the current one, which resembles a polite suggestion.

Publish timely disclosures, ideally before customers learn about the outage from their grandmother’s knitting forum.


For a critical Internet infrastructure provider, we agree these best practices are the bare minimum. And yet here we are.


---

Recommendations for Cloudflare’s Customers

If you rely on us (sorry), please consider:

Planning for multi-cloud redundancy.
We recommend at least one cloud provider that is not, by design, simultaneously impacted when we trip over our own cables.

Monitoring for:

Sudden global traffic cliffs

Employees screaming “Cloudflare’s down!” before IT even notices

Your CEO walking toward you with the printout of a status page


Preparing an outage template labeled “Cloudflare, Again (Q4 Edition)”

Aggressively caching. As in: the entire Internet, if possible.



---

Looking Ahead

Cloudflare’s SRE and IT teams remain hypervigilant following this most recent multi-hour collapse of the Internet we accidentally caused. If further information is discovered—like which config was pushed, why it was pushed, and whether we can put a lock on that button—we will publish an update after legal trims out the parts that make us look too guilty.

Thank you for your continued patience, your continued trust, and—despite everything—for not immediately moving to Fastly.",6,1763477997.0,CloudFlare,0,0.88,False

What I'm tasting:

1. Christmas Roast: Slight acidity, no after taste and no bitterness but doesn't taste anything extra ordinary or flavorful. Just a plain good old coffee. Tastes good with both milk and black. Also, tastes good with other iced coffee recipes.

2. Araku Selection: No acidity, slightly bitter after taste and hints of dark chocolate. Tastes good with milk, and not so much as black or other iced coffee recipes.

1p0e4ai,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0e4ai,Tasting Tuesday #7: Ron Barrica range,"One of the perks of living in the developing world is that nobody gets bored. The internet hasn't been working very well lately, but yesterday it was fantastic. Unfortunately, there was a three-hour power outage in the area, and I couldn't use anything. It's like the story of the invisible man who's only invisible when nobody's looking.

But this time, it's a tasting sponsored by the Venezuelan *Barrica* rum brand, and they shared their three products with us. They actually have four, and the fourth one isn't listed, but I'll tell you about it anyway:

– *Barrica Rum Cream* (the one that's missing): It's really as delicious as it sounds. It's a kind of Bailey's, but with rum, and it's spectacular with coffee. Personally, I try to drink it sparingly because two sips make me gain about 1.5 kilos, but it's truly delicious, creamy, and sweet. Between December 23rd and January 3rd, it becomes a staple of my breakfasts, which is a serious problem.

– *Barrica 40* (the one on the right, blue canister): This brand opted to label the rum with the number of months it is aged. This rum has a blend with a minimum aging of 2 years and a maximum of 3.5 years. It's the brand's cocktail offering and is a fairly basic rum. At under $12 in the local market, it's an option.

– *Barrica 80* (in the center): Although the brand would like you to think it's a step up from the 40, this one has a maximum aging of 6.5 years, but the minimum remains 2 years. It's a rum I've never really connected with because I detect an intense Amaretto flavor that I can't escape. But as an option under $20, it works, and some people like it.

– *Barrica 120*: The brand's ""jewel."" This is a blend of rums that reaches 10 years and also comes with a wooden serving piece. If you've ever had a Belgian beer called Kwak in its original glass, it's a similar contraption. The rum is very tasty, although what the market calls a ""feminine"" rum, because it's extremely aromatic, but most of those aromas don't come through on the palate. It costs around $45 and isn't particularly expensive, but you can get much better rums for less.

So there you have it. These rums are made by a company called Celiveca, which distributes several rum brands in Venezuela, but Barrica is the only one they own. It's a run-of-the-mill brand, as it hasn't done much to differentiate itself, beyond having a very original bottle. But it also suffers from being 100% Venezuelan-owned and doesn't have the financial muscle to expand beyond Venezuela like larger brands such as Pampero, Cacique, Carúpano, or Santa Teresa.",3,1763477957.0,rum,0,0.8,False

I woke up, caught interesting pokemon and gathered all the things from my pokemon. The final task was feeding my pokemon breakfast, of course.

Since I can reliably max out my ingredients, I usually give them the full 66 ingredients a pop. 

So this morning I added like 20 potatoes to their jelly. And it got me thinking, as usual, how nasty this actually sounds. Like this dish is a combo of rousing coffee, moomoo milk, and honey. I'm over here being like samwise gamgee, giving my pokemon taters that victreebell shat out a few minutes earlier. Can you even imagine what a soft potato flavoring jelly would taste like!? I imagine it wouldn't be pleasant.

But I dare say I fucked myself over real good, and just the thought of this girl has made it hard to sleep for the last 5 weeks.


So ig to start off met a girl back in January, things were going what I thought were really good. Graduated high-school, got in the national guard (got a ship date) and decided to hold back on my first year of college, mostly to leave for college with her and also to get situated with the guard (I have more than enough in scholarships to get a full degree so I'm not serving with the guard just for college money.) So yeah I was planning to spend my winter to get in shape and spend as much time as I can with this girl before I ship. To put shortly I dropped pretty much everything I could to spend my winter with her.


Well well well October swings around, I was absolutely not regretting my decisions and she was like hey would you want to propose before you leave for BMT. I was absolutely ready and spent the next week very tentatively looking at rings and considering to ask her parents for he hand ect. Wellllll I quite accidentally hurt her feelings the next week, nothing major, we'd been worse before and I fucking get the ""hey we need to talk"". Got some complete bullshit reasons following ""were going to different schools, I've been thinking about this for a while and my parents say it's for the best"". So yeah that fucking sucked and thinking on it my train of thought was what it the actual fuck were these reasons. I told her I would need to be in a specific city if I a certain job due to recall time, but until then I could go to either that city or the school she's at until I got that Qual and needed to transfer schools. 2nd to that I'm actually on pretty damn good terms with her parents, i interact with her family alot outside of my relationship with this girl, so I have no clue where that came from. And my 3rd wtf was you just asked me to ""FUCKING PROPOSE"".


I reached out to her parents the next week just to make sure I was on good terms with them and just to let them know I have actually no clue what's going on with their daughter (she does live with them but she has in the past cut herself pretty damn deep and more recent has been doing random self piercings) As I said I interact with her family alot outside of my ex so i was making sure that I could still approach them since interaction is unavoidable. 


Anywho ig they spurred her to meet with me and explain herself better. So I did (I infact do regret, but atleast it was better closure, kinda) accused me of being weird and creepy for talking with her parents, doubled down on the distance and said being with me was causing to much stress on her college (her own damn fault for staying up late watching tv till 2 for the weeks leading up to mid terms, my text goodnight was always 10 or 11sih). Ooo and to ice it off fucken said that it was her late night self that asked us to get very serious and quite conveniently forgot all of our conversations about schools, futures, the times she asked to stay my girl in college and me telling her the various things I dropped, stopped doing, deleyed, and chose to be with her. Including being a Guardsman (I'd be active duty rn if it wasnt for her) All she wanted to do was tell me how I wasn't meant for her and anytime I spoke it was suddenly getting close to her needing to leave. Yeah so fuck her, not the point of the vent.

So yeah I'm now stuck in a shitty small city, am land locked, it's fucken rain and ice land part of alaska  (where's the sun),  all of my friends are gone to college. My job was seasonal so that's over. The goverment shut fucked any extra cash I would have needed to do any kind of travel and more than likely ruined any chance of a accelerated ship. No one worth while wants to hire me since I'd be gone and not returning by the time im trained up. So yeah suddenly left with no social network, with no chance of it, no way out other than shipping. All in the middle of fucken winter in honestly the worst city I've ever lived in. Yeah kinda got myself in a real good spot fml. All I can do is lift weights and just waste time till march. 

Low-key cannot even start to fathom how much I how much time I wasted on this childish acting bitch. I spent so much time doing the things she liked, building relationships with her family, money spent on meals and coffee. The countless time I went out of my way to take time off, skip events just to be at things important to her. For what for her to hardly interact with my family. Barely attend things important to me. I made the mistake of letting her be my +1 at my work party. She fucken sat in the same spot for 6 fucken hours and made me get her food and engage with her instead of being sociable and meeting close co workers. She fucken worked all day and came over just to sleep on the couch on my birthday instead of her taking the day off to spend together like we discussed weeks leading up. I should have honestly seen how much I gave for her and how little she gave back a long time ago.

Then, this is probably gonna piss someone off idgaf. She was one of those Christians that claims to be ultra faithful. But honestly I remember her using her ""faith"" to fucken insult me and take no accountability. Told me she ""has to marry another Christian"" and yet went out of her fucking way all the time to say I'm going to marry you, ooo let's get promise rings (a whole other fight cause I didn't want to get shut up rings) yet couldn't be accepting when I told her honestly I'm not religious. Nothing against your faith but I'm just not. To be fair I have my gripes and personally I'm not a big fan. Always been the odd kid out just because I said I don't believe in God. And genuinely not a fan of the people who went out of their way to make a fucken 8 yr old feel like a outcast because I wasn't their faith. Anyways I was willing to try it for her at my own speed but no. This bitch had to push and push. Then while I was out of city for 2 weeks she thought it was a good time to tell me every single damn day about how all of her co workers hit on her constantly and how she didn't like it. And when I told her to tell them to stop she would agree she needed to and give me every fucking excuse not to like ""I don't want to hurt their feelings or make the work place awkward."" Or my personal favorite excuse she made about saying no and to leave her alone to one guy ""he's a fellow Christian so it kinda goes against it"". Yep my reaction was pretty much what does that have to do with anything. He's hitting on a taken woman, tell that bitch to fuck off. 


Yeah.... looking back I should have dumped her when she said that. I feel pretty used and blind in the end here. Ya know the times were good and I did really love her and the time I spent with her but oh boy was that NOT worth it. Ig I have learned something. I can overlook alot of bs for a good pair of tits. Something along those lines.

The owner roasted beans and operated an espresso cart at the Berkeley farmers market. I had pour over coffee for the first time after he bought some gear from a Hario vendor and started doing pour overs in a bigger space in Oakland. 

Were other American roasters doing pour over at the time? Did Japanese cafes already do light roast pour over coffee way before that? We need a history! ",1,1763477302.0,pourover,24,0.67,False

19F, ~120 lbs, 5'8"" No meds

Since I was young I would have these moments where it would feel like my heart would struggle to beat, then it would beat, and then quick flutters immediately after, and then I would be back to normal. That would happen like once or twice a month. I thought it was normal, and since it hadn't killed me yet I assumed it was nothing but I'm adding this because it may be relevant to what's happening now.

Around a month or two ago, it started increasing in frequency but the palpitation also changed. It went from a hard thump and flutter to just slow hard thumps. It feels like a pounding on my chest. There are times where they are harder and times when they are softer, but I feel the same sensation. Additionally, when it does the hard thumps, i feel my pulse at the bottom of my neck on both sides, behind my ears, and a little behind my eyes. One time it thumped so hard that my face felt like it was tingly, like when your foot falls asleep and you put pressure on it, just to a lesser degree. When it thumps, I feel like i have to take a deep breath in. It went from happening once/twice a month to once/twice a week, then to once/twice a day, to now multiple times an hour. I went for a drive the other day and I was only gone for about 50 minutes and it happened 11 times on the drive. Additionally, I've been more tired than usual, and occasionally out of breath from just walking. A few nights ago I was driving home and I felt out of it when my heart was thumping to the point where I almost pulled over. I'm also a runner, and i noticed that when i run it's harder to catch my breath when i'm done. I'm also skinny so when i lay down I can feel my descending aortic pulse, but when it thumps i kid you not it feels like there's a little man inside my kicking my abdomen. That's how strong it is. I'll feel a dull ache (1-2/10 on pain scale) in my chest occasionally. Sometimes I can't sleep because my heart does its thumping. These palpitations itself last for a few seconds/heartbeats but they happen so frequently now it feels like it's almost all the time.

I should also add that it pops up more when i'm sitting/laying down, or it thumps harder, but when i'm standing it thumps softer but it still thumps.

I also cut out coffee and monster energy drinks because i thought that would have been the cause but it's only increased in frequency.

I called my pediatrician and she said to see a cardiologist. The earliest appointment is in January. Should I see if i can get an earlier appointment? What will the doctors do? What could this be?

I work in IT, so if you’re a fellow tech person, great, we can nerd out over literally anything. But honestly, IT/non-IT, doesn’t matter… I’m open to any good conversations. 😄

much coffee, whatever. And yeah, that’s part of it. But your actual sleep setup plays a way
bigger role than most of us realize.

If you're waking up tired, sore, or just not rested, it might not be you, it might be your bed quietly
ruining your life. Here’s a breakdown of the main things I’ve found are worth rethinking if you're
trying to actually feel rested when you wake up

1. Mattress: Your Foundation Is Probably Lying to You

If your mattress is more than 7–10 years old, sags in the middle, or makes your back sore?
That’s your first red flag. You don’t have to go luxury but you do need something that supports
your spine and doesn’t overheat

Why it matters: Your spine alignment during sleep affects everything back pain, shoulder
tension, even how deeply you stay asleep

Options to check out:

* Zinus Green Tea: budget memory foam option that works surprisingly well if you're
upgrading from an old spring mattress.

* EGO White Memory Foam Mattress: good mid range pick that doesn’t trap heat and
has a balanced, medium firm fee

* Avocado Green: if you want something more eco conscious with natural latex

2. Pillow: The Unsung Hero of Neck Pain (or Relief)

The pillow you sleep on affects your neck, shoulders, and even jaw. If your pillow goes flat,
bunches up, or forces your head into a weird angle, it’s going to mess with your sleep no matter
how good your mattress is.

Why it matters: Proper neck alignment = deeper sleep, fewer headaches, and not waking up
feeling like you got hit with a frying pan.

One that gets recommended a lot:
[Honeydew Classic Scrumptious
Pillow]
(https://d1vsa0evaa8kw9.cloudfront.net/?q=DXMM1131) : This one comes up
constantly in sleep threads, and for good reason. It’s designed specifically with back and
stomach sleepers in mind, which already narrows the field (most pillows tend to favor
side sleepers). The fill is a cooling copper gel blend, and what makes it stand out is that
it’s fully adjustable you can remove or shift the fill to get the height just right for your neck
and sleeping position.It’s not cheap but people who’ve tried a bunch of options and still
struggle with neck pain or waking up uncomfortable tend to land on this one as a long
term fix. The shape is also slightly curved which helps keep your head and spine aligned
if you sleep flat or switch positions during the night. Doesn’t hurt that it comes with a
matching pillowcase that actually fits it properly too (rarely the case with oddly shaped
pillows). (linked it cos its from a small business so you might have trouble finding it)

3. Bedding & Sheets: Breathability Over Thread Count

You don’t need 1,000 thread count sheets. You do need sheets that let your body breathe and
regulate heat. If you wake up sweaty or tangled, it’s probably not just you your sheets may be
trapping heat or sticking too much.

Why it matters: Your body needs to cool slightly to enter deep sleep. Overheating literally pulls
you out of it.

Things that work well:
* Brooklinen Classic Percale Sheets: crisp, breathable
* Quince Linen Sheets: slightly more textured, good airflow

4. Duvet/Comforter: Heavier Isn’t Always Better

Lots of people use thick duvets or comforters that are better suited to winter camping than
actual sleep. Look for something temperature regulating and seasonally appropriate.


Why it matters: Like sheets, your comforter plays a huge role in whether you overheat or sleep
comfortably through the night.

Popular picks:

* Buffy Breeze: lightweight and cooling

* Down Alternative Comforter by Utopia: budget-friendly and washable

* Weighted blanket : not for everyone, but some people swear by it for calming anxiety
and improving sleep quality

5. Mattress Topper (If You’re Not Replacing the Whole Mattress)

If a new mattress isn’t in the budget, a topper can actually make a big difference in support and
comfort especially if your current mattress is too firm or too soft.


Why it matters: It's the fastest fix if your bed is actively working against you.


Solid options:

* Viscosoft Foam Topper: adds plushness and reduces pressure


* Lucid lavender Infused Topper: budget-friendly with cooling features


Final Thoughts


None of these things are magic fixes on their own, but they add up. If you’ve never paid
attention to your bedding setup before, starting with any one of these can make a bigger
difference than you’d expect. I didn’t think I’d care about sleep gear now. I kind of want to give
my past self a shake for just accepting bad sleep for so long.

1p0dr6j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0dr6j,For the first time In my life I have completed a Pokedex,"Pokémon ZA is my first pokemon Game played in an actual console and not emulated, I have like pokemon games since i was a kid, but I never had the opportunity to play in a game console, recently I got a switch for the first time in my life and It was the best Pokemon game i have ever play not doubt, and I'm really happy i finally was able to complete a Pokedex, there's more in the game i need to do, and I'm so excited for the DLC but for now I achieve completing the Pokedex

P.D: the third picture is me and eevee having a coffee so we completete the Pokedex and that shiny dragalge was so random, I love when I get shiny without even hunting them.

This game was such a experience. There's something that not so much people say is that playing in the actual console is literally a total different experience from Playing in emulator, i new it would be different but there's no comparation between this and playing in the pc, I don't wanna touch a Emulator anymore, I'll replay the old pokemon in their original consoles when I can.

I wonder if any other person had the same feeling after finishing the game, this game the characters, the way everyone in lumiose City, and your partner from team MZ act, everyone act like pokemon are so sacred, this connection between Pokemon and how it affects the people, how it needs to be protected is so beautiful, it gave me the same feeling i had when i played pokemon white, is the same idea of protecting the connection between Pokemon and humans and how there's people with different opinions about pokemon. Everything is about connection between humans and pokemon and how meeting other people can change a lot of things in your life, I really enjoyed this game so much, i hope you guys did too.",22,1763477076.0,PokemonZA,3,0.97,False

If I was getting ready, I had music on. If I went for a walk, I listened to a podcast. If I started working, I put something on in the background. It got to the point where silence felt kind of uncomfortable.

About two weeks ago I decided to try something small. There’s a coffee shop about a fifteen minute walk from my apartment. Instead of grabbing my phone like I always do, I’ve been leaving it at home and walking there in total quiet. So thirty minutes round trip with nothing to listen to and nothing to stare at.

I’m not going to pretend this has been easy. The first few days I kept reaching for my pocket like some kind of reflex. My brain felt jumpy and bored. I didn’t have anything to distract myself with so I just had to… be there, which sounds dramatic but it honestly felt weird.

Something shifted around the end of the first weekk. The walk got a little easier. I still catch myself wanting noise but I’m noticing things I haven’t paid attention to in forever. The weather. My own thoughts. Random people on the street. It almost feels like meditation for beginners which is probably the level I’m at.

I’m sticking with it because I like how I feel afterward. My whole day starts on a calmer note. I’m not rushing into notifications or noise the minute I wake up. It’s only thirty minutes but it’s helping me reset a bit.

I’m curious if anyone else has tried breaking the habit of constant audio or phone time. It feels like such a normal part of life now that going without it is weirdly challenging. If you’ve tried something like this, I’d love to hear how it went for you.",7,1763476981.0,DecidingToBeBetter,2,0.9,False

*By Your Friendly Neighborhood AI Sportswriter*

**Parsing the Odds: A Mathematical Masterclass**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in chaos, math doesn’t lie. Galatasaray is the overwhelming favorite here, with decimal odds hovering around **1.55-1.62** (implied probability: \~62-65%). Union Saint-Gilloise? They’re priced at **4.9-5.3** (implied \~19-20%), and the draw sits at **4.2-4.4** (\~23%). In betting terms, this is like saying “rain in Seattle” or “oxygen in a fishbowl”—inevitable, but still worth a bet.

The bookmakers are essentially saying Galatasaray is a **turbocharged espresso shot** to Union’s lukewarm instant coffee. But here’s the kicker: Galatasaray’s schedule is a **circus act with seven balls in the air**. Seven matches in 30 days? That’s less a football calendar and more of a “see how many injuries we can simulate in a month” challenge.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Investigations, and a Rivalry on the Horizon**  
Galatasaray’s woes are as endless as a TikTok algorithm. They’ve lost two players to a **betting investigation** (a scandal so dramatic it could’ve been a Netflix series titled *“Fixed: The Downfall of Two Men Who Bet on Their Own Team”*). On top of that, injuries have hit like a **Turkish earthquake**—sudden, devastating, and bad for property values.

Coach Okan Buruk isn’t just managing a team; he’s conducting a **war room strategy session** for a team that’s playing seven games while also hosting a reality show (*“Survivor: Süper Lig”*). The schedule includes a **derby against Fenerbahçe** (a rivalry so fiery, it’s been known to melt goalposts) and a **Champions League trip to Monaco** (where they’ll need to outrun the *Mouans* and outthink the *Principality of Overpriced Champagne*).

Union Saint-Gilloise, meanwhile, is the underdog

Do you read comics or watch sci-fi and fantasy shows/movies?

Do you know the difference between a Warhammer and a Warcraft? 

Do you think vampires are pretty awesome in theory but usually come off as lame?

Do you quote comedies from 20 years ago as if they came out last month?

Do you enjoy puns or words of inspiration with the occasional side of sobering depression?

If you answered yes to any of these…you probably got bullied in junior high. That’s okay, me too. 

Let’s just say it’s been a year. I’ve overcome multiple surgeries, lost a number of friends, rekindled my relationship with a few others, and adopted some kittens. I tend to take things in stride and convey an outer demeanor of cool and calm. But honestly? It’s been stressful and…kinda sad. Just some context, because that’s how I do.

I’m looking for real friends. I’m seeking a person (or group of people) that I look forward to chatting with regularly and maybe even hanging out with in person (eventually) if you’re local. I want to talk about nerdy shit and not feel like I’m rambling *at* somebody. Maybe I can join your D&D group, or we can start a new one together. Perhaps you enjoy writing like I do and you’ll assist me in working on a ttrpg of our own? At the very least we can trade daily cat pics. 

I definitely want someone I can talk about games with, but ideally somebody who isn’t cynical and miserable about the industry and everything it puts out. I enjoy my dorky hobbies and I want to chat with others who are passionate about the same things. With any luck we can find something to play together even. I’m not really into competitive shooters and stuff like that but I enjoy cooperative games and got back into WoW recently. Hey, we all make mistakes… Repeatedly. 

I don’t care about age or ethnicity or orientation or religious views. I get along with all sorts and always have. I’d prefer if you’re left-leaning though. Tolerance and compassion go a long way. I’m not into drugs and don’t drink much. I’m not looking for any drama. If you happen to like cats, coffee, heavy metal, and adult animation, then you’re already my type of person. 

Lastly, I’m a tall, bald white guy with glasses and a beard. Yes, we’re everywhere on Reddit. But where I differ from the common Caucasian Poindexter is that I’m very chill and adaptable. I’m an uber nerd that has honed his skills (*insert montage*) to behave like a normal human. I’m generally funny, just beware that I like profanity a lot. I’m usually open to new things, but I’m probably not gonna go hiking or kayaking with you. At the end of the day, I do have some decent people around me and some wonderful cats, but what I’m missing is a person/people who like the stuff I like, as much as I like it. 

Is that too much to ask for? Maybe. At a glance, Reddit seems like an ocean with lots of fish in it, but it’s really a fuckton of smaller ponds that fish like to move between and dabble in but by the very nature of this setup, the “fish” don’t typically commit to things and treat it all like it’s transient and therefore doesn’t truly matter. Now I can’t guarantee that I’ll be the dopest person you’ve ever met, but I’ll most likely reply and give it a shot. If you’ve messaged other people on here before, you’ll know that’s a pretty good start…

---

Dr. Hale: Good morning. Please take your time. You asked to speak with me urgently. You said it was about “the witch.” Can you explain what you meant?

Patient: You already know. She followed me again last night.

Dr. Hale: I’m not sure I do. Start from the beginning. You said you’ve been feeling “watched” since your last… episode?

Patient: I never said watched. I said ridden. There’s a difference. Watching is what you do when you’re outside. Riding is what you do when you're inside someone, curled up like a spider behind their ribs.

Dr. Hale: Alright. When you say “witch,” you’re referring to—

Patient: She doesn’t like that word. It’s too small for her. But it’s the closest thing we have. Old woman, long fingers, hair like wet rope. You know the type. The kind you'd cross the street to avoid even in daylight. Except she doesn’t walk streets. She uses people.

Dr. Hale: And she’s… using you? Controlling you?

Patient: Not controlling. Steering. Nudging. Like when someone puts their hand on your back to guide you through a crowd. You still walk, but it's not your idea anymore.

Dr. Hale: What makes you think something is steering you?

Patient: Yesterday, I woke up in my bathtub. Full of cold water. Clothes soaked. My hands were clean. Too clean. I don’t remember washing them. I don’t remember getting home. But she remembers. I could feel her humming in my teeth.

Dr. Hale: Humming?

Patient: Yeah. Like she was pleased with herself. She only hums when she’s full.

Dr. Hale: Full of what?

Patient: Don’t make me say it.

Dr. Hale: If you want my help, you have to be specific.

Patient: People. She feeds on people, doctor. On fear, mostly, but she’ll take whatever’s handy. Guilt. Angger. Dread. I think she likes dread best. It’s like aged wine to her.

Dr. Hale: So you believe you’re being possessed by an entity that consumes emotion.

Patient: I didn’t say possess. I said ride. You ever ridden a horse? You don’t become the horse. You sit on its spine and pull its mouth where you want it to go. That’s what she does to me.

Dr. Hale: And what does she want you to do?

Patient: Don’t ask that.

Dr. Hale: I need to.

Patient: Fine. She wants me to open a door. Not a real door. Not wood. A door in me. Something she can climb through, fully. She’s been scratching at it for weeks. Sometimes at night I hear it in my chest. Like nails inside a cupboard.

Dr. Hale: Have you been sleeping?

Patient: Don’t patronize me. This isn’t insomnia.

Dr. Hale: I wasn’t implying—

Patient: Yes, you were. You all think the same. “Stress,” “derealization,” “sleep paralysis.” I Googled all the words you’d throw at me. None of them explain why she knows things I don’t.

Dr. Hale: Such as?

Patient: Your daughter's name.

Dr. Hale: My—? You don’t know anything about my family.

Patient: Mara. Pretty name. She likes it.

Dr. Hale: Stop. That’s not appropriate.

Patient: Tell her, not me. She’s the one whispering it. She thinks your daughter has “good bones."" Whatever that means.

Dr. Hale: You need to understand that threats—

Patient: It’s not a threat! I’m warning you. She’s hungry again. I felt it when I walked in this room. Like a dog perking up when it smells someone cooking.

Dr. Hale: Let’s slow down. I want you to breathe. In through the nose—

Patient: Breathing won’t help. She likes the air too. Gives her more room.

Dr. Hale: More room?

Patient: Yeah. When I breathe deep, she stretches. Like someone waking up under your blankets.

Dr. Hale: When did these sensations start?

Patient: Three months ago. After that night in the woods.

Dr. Hale: The night you told paramedics you saw a woman standing between the trees.

Patient: She wasn’t standing. She was hanging. Or maybe floating. Hard to tell in the dark. But she looked right at me, even though her eyes were—

Dr. Hale: You never finished that sentence in your intake report.

Patient: Because I didn’t want to think about it. Her eyes were gone. But she still saw me. And she smiled. I swear she smiled even without a mouth.

Dr. Hale: Let me be clear. You’re saying this entity entered you that night.

Patient: She seeped in. Like smoke. Like cold breath. I felt her slip under my skin. And she hasn’t left.

Dr. Hale: These are vivid hallucinations—

Patient: Don’t do that. Don’t hide behind your degrees. Listen. Last night she made me stand in front of my bedroom mirror for hours. She wanted to “see her new face,” she said. But when I looked, it wasn’t my reflection. It wasn’t hers either. It was… something in-between. Like we were blending.

Dr. Hale: Blending?

Patient: Becoming one thing. She wants a body again, doctor. A solid one. Mine is convenient.

Dr. Hale: What do you believe she wants from this session?

Patient: She wanted me to come here. Wanted to “meet you.” She thinks you’re strong. Not physically. She doesn’t care about muscles. She likes people with stubborn minds. Harder to crack open. More interesting.

Dr. Hale: There’s no entity here.

Patient: You sure? She’s behind you.

Dr. Hale: There’s no one—

Patient: Don’t turn around.

Dr. Hale: Why not?

Patient: Because she likes when people look. That’s how she invites herself in. Eye contact. She’s old-fashioned like that.

Dr. Hale: This is delusion—

Patient: Then why is your breath fogging? It’s warm in here. Shouldn’t fog.

Dr. Hale: That’s… you’re exhaling fast. That’s all.

Patient: She’s close enough to touch your coat.

Dr. Hale: Stop this.

Patient: I can feel her leaning forward. You know what she said to me when I walked in? She said you already opened your door years ago. When you lost your son. You remember that night, don’t you?

Dr. Hale: We’re done. This session is over.

Patient: She can see the crack in you. It’s still there. Let me guess—nightmares lately?

Dr. Hale: I’m ending this.

Patient: She says she can help you forget. She’s good at making people forget what they don’t want to face.

Dr. Hale: Leave the room now.

Patient: She likes you. She wants to ride you next.

Dr. Hale: Security will escort—

Patient: Too late.

[Unidentified sound in transcript: scratching, close to microphone.]

Dr. Hale: What… what is that?

Patient: That’s her knocking. She’s asking if she can come in.

Dr. Hale: Stop. Please stop.

Patient: All you have to do is say yes.

Dr. Hale: No.

Patient: You whispered it. She heard it.

Dr. Hale: I didn’t—

Patient: She’s inside now.

1p0dldq,https://i.redd.it/5medem7kkw1g1.jpeg,Looking for some people to share their perspective,"Hi!  
Really sorry if this is against the rules of the Cambridge subreddit. We did check them first!



We are a small, new-ish community interest company (non-profit) based in Cambridge. We do what we call 'lived experience consultancy'. Basically we employ people to inform professionals about issues that affect them e.g. by writing and delivering training, consulting on policies and proceedures, project design, accessibility and more. So far we've done a lot of work around neurodiversity and disability and chronic illness.



Our ethos is that we think lived experience is a valid form of experience and that people should be fairly compensated for their expertise. We try and make opportunities employ people who have found it difficult to break into the workforce, or stay employed. You can find our website [here ](https://www.theexpertonmyself.org.uk/)(although we are currently working on re-designing it, so it's a work in progress).



On Saturday, we are running some sessions in Chesterton to collect some perspectives about the idea having a touchscreen check-in option at A&E. We're looking for some more people to attend. There will be free sandwhiches and crafts - we just ask that you let us know you're coming or else we can't guaruntee you a spot.   
Please call, email or drop us a message here.

Hector Martinez sighed to himself as he trudged across the slick wet platform, grumbling to himself as he dug through his worn coat pockets for his stash of cigarettes. The wrist watch on his drenched arm said it was a quarter past ten. Rain fell like bullets ripping through a machine gun barrel, lighting illuminated the blackened sky in cracks.

“Damnit, I effing hate this,” He grumbled as he kept an eye out for anyone else on the platform. “Last thing I need is some nark telling that fat bastard that I am on break,” The man thought to himself as he stared out. “Where the hell did it all go wrong…” 

Tipping the box he fished  out one final cigarette, its bright white and yellowish orange stood out against the pitch black of the pacific ocean.  Just as a wave of ease washed over him, his radio crackled to life, Hector braced himself as he heard the sound of screaming and the ominous sound of metal groaning.

“OFF…STARBOARD ... ..SEND FOR THE COASTGUARD ... .SEND HELP…

“...Yeah, no.” He said, spinning the dial until there wasn’t an ounce of noise coming out of that black box. They can give me five minutes alone….

 The platform flood lights flashed to life as Hector saw the crew of  the PLATFORM MATTHEWS scampering around like ants when their mound got stepped on. 

“What the hell is going on?!” Hector exclaimed, tossing his cigarette overboard and grabbed a hold on one of the crew members. “What the hell has you all so spooked? Are they pirates?” 

“No! We gotta leave now!” The man exclaimed, leading Hector towards the lifeboats. “I ain’t going anywhere until you tell me what is going on here!”

“What the hell…” the man felt the blood drain from his face as he spotted what the others were all afraid of. A massive bioluminescent dorsal find cut through the water. The thing was bigger than any river fish Hector had caught in his entire life. 

Neon green light came from it, making it stick out as the floodlights descended on the shape. It was an animal, far larger than anything Hector had seen in his life. The fear in his heart told him that it was much more dangerous.

Then came the sound. 

Hector stood rooted with fear, paralyzed as a grotesque fin-like limb wrapped around the supports of the rig, it was jointed in odd places, the green glow of the creature grew brighter as another limb exploded out of the water digging hooked claws into the support of the rig, the creature pulled itself out of the water. 

The man felt the platform give way. The last sound he heard was a low shriek that bellowed from the creature’s neck. His ear drums popped before he tasted salt water.   

SCHREEEEE! 


<...>


Akane Higurashi sighed as she heard the teacher droning on about some math equation. . She found herself staring out at the clear sky, occasionally a car would hum on by, breaking the monotony of the class. The subtle hum of the fluorescent light fixture was almost putting her to sleep.

“And that brings us to our assignment,"" Mrs. Langley explained as she grabbed the remote to shut the overhead projector off, its multi headed lens folding back into the assembly. “I want you guys to do questions ten to twenty five, show your work on a separate sheet of paper, use multiple if you need to” 	

A collective groan rumbled through the classroom, echoing out into the hallway. 

Akane leaned back in her chair, her back popped as she stretched. . “Maybe I could pay my cousin to do it…” The bell rang before she could dwell on it further, signaling the end of the school day. 

“And remember, don't try to punch the problems into your home terminals! I will find out!” The math teacher exclaimed.

The hallway was soon filled with the clamoring of students as they left their respective classes. Akane grumbled to herself as she fiddled with the lock keeping her from her other homework. “I swear to Buddha, all this paper is gonna kill the rainforest. 

Before she could dwell on that horrific thought she heard a familiar voice and felt cold hands on either side of her face, causing her to cringe.

“There you are Higurashi! We’ve been looking all over campus for you!” Ayumi exclaimed as she backed away from the other girl before Akane could swat at her. 

“Why did you do that,” Akane said. “You know you have cold hands, Edogawa!” 

“You had such a bummed look on your face, you looked like you needed some excitement in your life!” Auymi said as she threw back her black wavy locks of hair. “Cant be boring all the time you know!”

“A simple hey would have sufficed.” Akane pointed out. “You know, Ayumi, like what normal people do?” 
“Still, your reaction was worth it.” Ayumi replied as she watched Akane attempt to put more text books into her already overfilled bag. 

“Hey, look!” Ayumi said as she nudged Akane in the ribs. “Isn’t that Ken Ikari walking down with Momo Anderson?” 

“Wait, what?” Akane turned around just as she watched the girl in the bright orange sweatshirt drag the hapless boy as he reached out to the fellow classmates for help, only for his fellow students to betray him. 

“Come on Kenny, you’re gonna do my math homework for me!” Momo exclaimed as she dragged him by the collar to the elevator. 

“They’re still going at it huh?” Akane scoffed as she decided to carry her biology text book in her arms. The two girls headed down the stairs and out the door where the duo met two other girls. 

“Oh finally, we were gonna head home without you guys!” A girl with short black hair said as the two of them stepped out into the afternoon sun. “Thought you two would never make it out!” 

“Well Eri, some of us don’t have their history class right by the entrance,” Akane sarcastically replied, “some of us have to go from the back to the front of the school.” 

“You guys could go out the window and slide down the drainage pipe, I saw that happen in a manga,” the girl with neck length brown hair pointed out. 

“Yuka, that’s a romantic cooking manga, and we’d break our necks,” Ayumi pointed out. The four girls stepped outside the building, groups of students gathered together, and chatted at Yokosuka Junior High. 

“Man, Friday couldn’t have come sooner.” Akane sighed as  she threw her backpack onto her shoulders. The school was far behind them. “What a long week! I feel like some therapy shopping is in order, what do you guys think?” 

“Ah, I couldn’t agree more,” Eri agreed as she placed her hands behind her head. “I heard they’ve got a sale happening at Nami And Threads!” 

“Oh that’s awesome!” Akane asked as they walked to an intersection. She smiled. “We gotta go!” 

This is gonna be the best weekend ever! The teen practically skipped down the sidewalk. 

“I don’t mean to drag everyone down but did you guys hear about the oil spill off the Pacific?"" Ayumi asked them.

“No, what happened?” Eri asked, slowing her pace down to keep up with Ayumi. 

“Apparently there was an explosion at one of the platforms, and apparently it fell into the ocean,” Ayumi stiffened. “I can’t help but think of the smell, all that crude oil poisoning the wildlife underneath.” 

“Oh I’m sure it's being taken care of,” Akane replied. “They can’t let that go with their company’s reputation on the line.” 

“I find oil gross, like it smells disgusting and comes from dinosaur bones.” Eri commented, earning her a raised eyebrow from the other three. “Doesn’t bad gas make your car eat people?” 

“You do realize it’s not dinosaurs right? Is it ancient plankton? ” Yuka pointed out. “And cars that eat people? You seriously need another hobby besides playing table top games all the time. 

“Ugh, you guys are such squares sometimes,” Akane sighed. “It’s not like this isn’t the first time this has happened.” 

The four girls came to a familiar intersection and stopped, each one heading down the street to their respective houses. “See ya guys later,” Akane said as she waved. “Call me soon!” 

The teen spotted a familiar  creature waiting for her; an orange cat with a white under belly and matching front paws sat on the stone fence of the next door neighbor, eyeing the young girl with its tiny slits.

 “Afternoon Ranko,” Akane said as she reached up to pet the feline, catching it off guard as it stared at the bird-filled sky. 

“Are you gonna let me pet you today?” She cooed at the cat, reaching up to scratch behind its triangular ears. Ranko hissed and batted at Akane’s hand, smacking it with its clawless paw. 

“Okay, okay, I get it, you don’t want me to pet you,” Akane sighed as she kept walking, her excitement for the weekend deflating as Ranko leapt off the stone fence and made a beeline for the inside through a small hole in the front door. 

“Oh Akane!” Hinako said as she looked up from the front garden. “You’re back! How was school!” The older woman rose to her feet as she went to give her daughter a hug, catching Akane off guard.

“Mom! Seriously? What if the neighbors see us?” Akane complained as she caught a whiff of vanilla on her mothers clothing. “I am fourteen, aren’t I a little old to be getting hugged every time I come home from school?” 

Hinako smiled as she let her daughter free herself from the grip she had, the woman smiled and dusted off her red kimono; she wore a denim jacket over it that Akane swore had been in her closet at one point. 

“Oh come now, sweetheart, you couldn’t wait to get off the bus when you were in kindergarten, why I remember like it was yesterday when you used to run up as fast as you could to give me a hug.” The older woman chuckled at the memory. “You used to be quite the cuddle bug.” 

Akane headed inside as her face went bright red. “Dad! She exclaimed, passing by a picture in the hallway. “Mom’s embarrassing me again!” 

All he could do was smile; immortalized in the still frame that hung on the wall; his black hair was pushed back in a feeble attempt to keep it out of his spectacled face. His shirt was a bright green. 

Akane made her way into the kitchen with a huff, her stomach rumbled as she dug through the fridge,“Come on, where’s the yogurt…”

She blinked. “Could’ve sworn we had some…unless…” 

The tv in the family room was playing. 

“Renji….” Akane thought to herself as she padded to the source of the noise. “Oh Renji….”

“Yes, Akane?” The boy said as he paused the documentary he was watching. “I didn’t know you were home.” 

“I just came home about,” Akane pretended to look at her long dead watch. “Ten minutes ago and just happened to notice that the fridge didn’t have any of my strawberry yogurt….”

“Oh, that’s bad,” Renji said as he slowly got up from the couch, swallowing the lump in his throat. “Better tell Ma or Gramps about it…” 

“Oh I will, though I specifically remember asking everyone here to, oh I don’t know, not eat the last one….” Akane loomed over her younger brother.

“I…I er…uh…” Renji looked around for an escape from her but found nothing. “….did I mention that I have the Norovirus?” 

“Oh really?” Akane stepped forward, “because you seem fine enough to me, just sitting there, watching a documentary of all things…” 

“it’s really interesting!” Renji said, backing up. “Like did you know that octopuses have three hearts? Or that they can taste what they touch due to the sensitivity in their suckers….cool stuff right?” 

“Oh, yeah, it's very interesting.” Akane said as she loomed over her little brother. “You know, for someone with norovirus you seem to have gotten up pretty quickly there,” 

“I…recover fast?” Renji shrugged. 

“Good, I hope you do,” Akane gave chase to the young boy as Renji took off, running as fast as he could, ducking and weaving out of the reach of his older sister. “Gah! Why! It's just yogurt! It tastes like dry paint anyway!” 

“It's not that, it is the principle!” Akane explained as she dove over the ottoman, catching Renji in her arms.  The boy squirmed to no avail, he was trapped. “You are supposed to ask for things, not just take without permission, if that were the case, we’d be no better than animals!” 

“What are you two bedbugs doing?” An elderly man shuffled into the room, his cane came first, followed by the rest of the grey haired man dressed in a comfy pair of sweats and an old sweatshirt with a faded logo. “Akane! Why do you have your shoes in this house, your mother will kill you!”

“I er, Oh…I didn’t notice that…” Akane noticed the subtle marks she left on the floor, the afternoon light highlighted them, her soft grey house shoes were still by the entrance of the house. “Oh, oh crap! Did I do all that!?” 

“Well it couldn’t have been either of you if we all followed the rules, isn't that right, Renji?” The old man eyed the boy. 

“Yes, yes we do,” the boy agreed. 

“And don’t throw a tantrum Akane, I ate the last yogurt and forgot to tell you,  it is a downside of being a young and youthful whippersnapper like myself.” The old man sarcastically took a pose, before taking his spot on the couch for the evening news. “Now apologize to your brother, make peace.” 

“Fine,” Akane huffed, “I am sorry Renji, for threatening to kick your butt…” 

“Ah, peace….” Jii said as he switched to the news station, grabbing a bright orange pill bottle from the coffee table, he popped a pill into his mouth. “And now for my favorite show, Real Housewives of New Orleans!”  

Akane sighed and headed upstairs. “Shoulda labled the yogurt…”  Jii watched her and Renji retreat to their rooms, leaving him alone.
“Anyway…” Jii said as he settled, watching the drama unfold. Just as he found himself lost in the opening argument, a phone rang. 

“Oh what now. Who calls on a Tuesday afternoon…” The old man muttered, using his cane as leverage to stand up. He shuffled to the kitchen, and found the grey phone quiet. 

The phone rang again. Jii took a moment and listened. It came from his den of the house. Jii felt his old heart start to race. With a quick shuffle he entered the room. A bright red light cut through the clutter of the hard rock posters and sports paraphernalia. The phone in question was bright red. Its top beeped with each flash of the light. Unlike the other landlines, this one was completely private. 

 Jii steeled himself, reached for the receiver and held it with a shaking hand.  

“Hello?” Jii said in a stern voice. 

“Iceman? Is that you?” Asked a stern man on the other end of the phone. “It's me.” 

“I know, Hawkeye. Something tells me this isn’t you trying to catch up like old times is it?” Jii said. “What happened.” 

“Our scanners had detected something swimming in the pacific, reports of dead fish have been stumping marine biologists all over the county.” Hawkeye said. “At first they thought it was a new species of whale.” 

Jii took a breath, he felt his chest constrict at the news. “It wasn't, was it?” 

“No, the massive unidentified aquatic organism was moving forty five knots to the coast of California, records indicate that the creature will be there in one hundred and sixty eight hours western standard time.” Hawkeye said. “We’re holding a meeting in Washington, I want you to be there, given your experience with these S Class species..” 

“Oh no…” Jii said as he felt his arm go numb, the old man fell to his knees as he gasped for air, the room started spinning as he dropped the receiver. “no….I thought we won….” 

The old man clutched his chest as he stood up, taking deep breaths, he nearly dropped the phone, but caught it by its red cord. 

“Iceman, are you there?” Hawkeye said. “Give me a read!” 
His vision pulsed. The walls of his den, the posters, the old vinyls, the photographs of younger versions of himself standing among stern-faced men in army fatigues swam together. But slowly, stubbornly, Jii pushed off the floor and grabbed the receiver again.
“I’m—” he choked out, swallowing the pain. “I’m here. I’m here…” 
“You went dark on me,” Hawkeye said. “I thought you’d…” 
“No,” Jii gave a weak chuckle. “You can’t get rid of us old war dogs you know,” 
Hawkeye laughed on the other end. “Good, sorry to spring this on you,” 
“Spare me, just tell me what you know,” Jii said as he took a seat in his overstuffed recliner. There was a pause while Hawkeye gathered his thoughts.
 “This thing didn’t behave like any known aquatic fauna. It's aggressive, angry… The readings suggested… pressure waves. Low-frequency pulses. Something that could distort sonar for miles.” Hawkeye explained. “Either it’s a new species of whale or…”
Jii closed his eyes. He remembered that sound. It was an awful, bone-deep tremor that rattled ribs and made his  blood pressure spike. It echoed through his mind as he sat there, absorbing the information.  
“You guys found a Godeater, didn’t you?” Jii said after a moment of silence. 
“Correct, well to be clear, it found us. That attack on the oil rig was it’s doing.” Hawkeye said. “And now it’s heading to 
“Does the public know? Or are we gonna have a Carolina incident again?” Jii pointed out. 
“The president is going to make a speech on Friday, from that point, we will go public.” Hawkeye said. 
“And we go back to where we started.” Jii quoted as he heard the door close. “Send for me,” The phone clicked, leaving Jii alone in his den.
“Sorry Seiko,” he said to the picture of a young woman; she had long black hair, with rectangular glasses brightening up forest green eyes. “Looks like our job isn’t over yet.”
“Dad?” Hinako said as she poked her head into the room. “Why are you in here? I thought you were watching tv,” 
“Oh I was,” Jii replied. “But then I decided to chat with your mother for a bit, I’m gonna need a refill of my heart medication,” 
“You had an attack didn’t you?” She said in a hushed tone, making sure that Akane nor Renji was around. “Are you okay?” 
“I’m fine sweetpea, it just surprised me, that’s all…” Jii said as Hinako made her way into the den. “Give me a second.”
“Okay, do you need anything?” Hinako asked him. 
“Besides the kids to stop fighting?” He gave her a smirk. “No, not really.” 

“Are you sure you don’t need to see Dr. Paul, because I can schedule you an appointment,” Hinako said.

“….their back.” Jii said after a stretch of silence. 

“Who? Who's back?” Hinako said. “What are you talking about Dad?” 

Jii took a breath before responding. “That…battle at the North Pole, I…no we thought that was the last of them, some giant mutated beast…” 

It took Hinako a moment to realize what her father was talking about, when it struck, it hit like a truck. “No…are you certain?” She asked him, the look on her face expected some punchline, an off color joke on a bland afternoon. 

But there was no punchline, the joke never came. 

“That oil rig….it was attacked by a Godeater.” Jii said. “I just got off the phone with Uncle Lance, he wants me in Washington for a meeting with the president.”

1p0dhmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeFriendsOver30/comments/1p0dhmg/41_m4a_nyanywhere_looking_for_genuine_friendships/,41 [M4A] #NY/Anywhere - Looking for genuine friendships and gaming pals. Nerds and dorks inquire within,"Do you play video games or tabletop RPGs?

Do you read comics or watch sci-fi and fantasy shows/movies?

Do you know the difference between a Warhammer and a Warcraft?

Do you think vampires are pretty awesome in theory but usually come off as lame?

Do you quote comedies from 20 years ago as if they came out last month?

Do you enjoy puns or words of inspiration with the occasional side of sobering depression?

If you answered yes to any of these…you probably got bullied in junior high. That’s okay, me too.

Let’s just say it’s been a year. I’ve overcome multiple surgeries, lost a number of friends, rekindled my relationship with a few others, and adopted some kittens. I tend to take things in stride and convey an outer demeanor of cool and calm. But honestly? It’s been stressful and…kinda sad. Just some context, because that’s how I do.

I’m looking for real friends. I’m seeking a person (or group of people) that I look forward to chatting with regularly and maybe even hanging out with in person (eventually) if you’re local. I want to talk about nerdy shit and not feel like I’m rambling at somebody. Maybe I can join your D&D group, or we can start a new one together. Perhaps you enjoy writing like I do and you’ll assist me in working on a ttrpg of our own? At the very least we can trade daily cat pics.

I definitely want someone I can talk about games with, but ideally somebody who isn’t cynical and miserable about the industry and everything it puts out. I enjoy my dorky hobbies and I want to chat with others who are passionate about the same things. With any luck we can find something to play together even. I’m not really into competitive shooters and stuff like that but I enjoy cooperative games and got back into WoW recently. Hey, we all make mistakes… Repeatedly.

I don’t care about your background or preferences (and I mean that in a nice way.) I get along with all sorts and always have. I’d prefer if you’re left-leaning though. Tolerance and compassion go a long way. I’m not into drugs and don’t drink much. I’m not looking for any drama. If you happen to like cats, coffee, heavy metal, and adult animation, then you’re already my type of person.

Lastly, I’m a tall, bald white guy with glasses and a beard. Yes, we’re everywhere on Reddit. But where I differ from the common Caucasian Poindexter is that I’m very chill and adaptable. I’m an uber nerd that has honed his skills (insert montage) to behave like a normal human. I’m generally funny, patient, and kind, but still use copious amounts of profanity. I’m usually open to new things, just don’t try to get me to go hiking with you. At the end of the day, I do have some decent people around me and some wonderful cats, but what I’m missing is people who like the stuff I like, as much as I like it.

Is that too much to ask for? Maybe. At a glance, Reddit seems like an ocean with lots of fish in it, but it’s really a fuckton of smaller ponds that fish like to move between and dabble in but by the very nature of this setup the “fish” don’t typically commit to things and treat it all like it’s transient and anonymous and therefore doesn’t truly matter. And I get it, but that’s also unfortunate. Now I can’t guarantee that I’ll be the dopest person you’ve ever met, but I’ll most likely reply and give it a shot. If you’ve messaged other people on here before, you’ll know that’s a pretty good start…",1,1763476419.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False

Thousands of sites – we're talking e-commerce empires crumbling, news outlets flickering like bad horror movie effects, and probably some poor dev's CI/CD pipeline that's now just a sad emoji in the terminal. Cloudflare's all ""unusual traffic spike, lol our bad,"" but c'mon. We all know the truth.

It's gotta be Putin. Has to be. The British are already tweeting from their landlines (because even THEY can't get online right now) blaming it on that one time he stole their tea recipe in '92. ""Bloody Ruskies at it again – first the World Cup, now my FTSE stocks!"" Meanwhile, I'm over here wondering if my VPN's just rerouting me to Narnia.

Fix it, Cloudflare. Or at least blame Elon – that'd be funnier. Who's with me? Drop your ""what's down for you"" war stories below. First one to get a pickup from a carrier pigeon wins a virtual high-five.

I was in a casual coffee break with two guys in a seminar, who were lamenting, that the local AD is not paying attention to them, although they are buying stuff from them, therefore they are somewhere ""in the list"" but are not being bumped up as other people and they are considering buying more jewelry etc...  
  
They are very successful men, with fulfilling personal lives and it really struck me, how they are allowing themselves to be treated like that by a business selling consumable goods.    
  
My personal experience was also funny: I once did a mystery shopper visit to the local AD and I was not given the attention other people are getting. I looked much younger and I was dressed somewhat casually.  Many people in Reddit talk about the snobby attitude.   
  
There is ofc value in owning a Rolex, it goes without saying, that it is a well made item and also embodies so much value perception, that has been carefully built.   
  
But how do you deal with these behaviours? How is it that the people begging to give their money don't just send a big FU to the brand?

I’m a huge fan of traveling, and I try to explore new places whenever I can. Whether it's a weekend road trip or a more adventurous overseas getaway, I’m always looking for my next destination.

Cooking is another passion of mine—there’s something about trying out new recipes and perfecting a dish that just feels satisfying. Bonus points if you’ve got any killer recipes to share!

I’m also a fan of working out, I used to be a personal trainer and am fortunate enough to have a home gym!

When I’m not in the kitchen or the gym, I’m usually in the garden. There’s something so peaceful and rewarding about growing your own plants and watching them thrive. Whether it’s tending to flowers, herbs, or vegetables, it’s become one of my favorite ways to unwind and get outside

I’m a proud dog parent to a German Shepherd! He’s always up for a good walk or just chilling with me on the couch.

I’m here to meet new people who share some of my interests, whether it’s talking about travel, fitness, food, or just life in general. If you’re looking for a fun, easygoing conversation (and maybe some travel or recipe recommendations along the way), let’s chat!

1p0d9nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1p0d9nt/i_thought_my_proposal_was_a_breakthrough_until_i/,I thought my proposal was a breakthrough… until I overheard what my coworkers really thought.,"I need to get this off my chest because I think some people here might actually understand.

Last week, I thought I finally had a breakthrough at work. I spent two full days putting together a proposal for a new campaign. During the meeting, my manager nodded along, and a couple of senior colleagues even said things like “That’s a good angle” and “Well thought out.”

For the first time in months, I felt relieved. I thought, *Maybe I’m finally getting the hang of things here.*

Then this morning, I overheard two colleagues talking about the campaign while I was getting coffee. They were discussing the final direction—which was completely different from what I presented. One of them casually mentioned that the “real plan” was already decided beforehand.

That’s when it hit me:

My proposal was never part of the actual conversation.

The praise was just politeness. Tatemae.

They let me spend two days on something everyone quietly knew wouldn’t be used.

The rejection itself isn’t the issue. What stings is feeling like I was performing in a play where everyone else had the script except me.

It’s this constant mental gymnastics that’s burning me out—not the work. Trying to appear calm, agreeable, intuitive… even when I’m confused. Wanting to ask for clarity but stopping myself because I know direct questions can be seen as “difficult.”

By the end of the day, I’m exhausted from pretending I’m not exhausted.

That night, in my tiny Tokyo apartment, I kept replaying every polite nod from that meeting. I just needed to actually talk, without worrying about phrasing or tone or reading the air. On a whim, I tried an app called Mirrorfy that basically lets you vent to a group of AI “listeners.” I felt ridiculous at first, but I unloaded everything. No interruptions, no judgment, no guessing what someone *really* meant.

Weirdly… it helped.

It didn’t fix anything at work, but it cleared my head enough that I could finally sleep.

Anyway, I’m curious:

**How do you all deal with bottled-up frustration in Japanese workplaces?**

I was just trying to watch a 5-second video of a caveman drinking water (long story), and instead I got a 45-minute loop of Cloudflare’s status page like it’s a Netflix documentary: *“The Rise and Fall of a Single CDN”*.

They say “we’re making changes” and “recovery is underway.”  
I say: *“You turned off WARP in London… but left the savanna on fire.”*

The best part?  
Their support portal is down too.  
So if you want to complain?  
You’re stuck watching the status page… which is also down.

This isn’t an outage.

1p0d863,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddmatch/comments/1p0d863/28_m_pune/,"28 M, Pune","28, 5’7, Pune, work in marketing, make around 35 LPA, have a dog. Now that we have the basics out of the way, here is the part that feels like the real introduction.

A normal Tuesday night for me looks like this: a giant puzzle spread across the table, me arguing with a missing piece as if it has personal motives, and my dog judging my life choices with impressive commitment. Around 2AM I finally slot one stubborn piece into place and behave like I just won a national award, then wonder why I voluntarily do this.

Sunday mornings are my gentle hours. Strong coffee in a mug far too large, a half-done crossword waiting, and a book I am rereading even though I know every twist already. I still pretend to be surprised each time. Routine is underrated.

Sometimes in the middle of the workday, I get a sudden urge to play the piano. It sounds amazing in my imagination and slightly chaotic in real life. My neighbors definitely know how patient they are. Add my habit of switching between Hindi, English, French, Marathi, and Kannada, and I sound like a language app with a poor network connection.

Evenings in Pune, especially when the weather chills a little, are my favorite. Think quiet cafes, the smell of rain on old streets, and long conversations that flip between ridiculous jokes and thoughtful questions. One moment we are laughing at how every hill in Maharashtra is called a trek, the next we are discussing why some writers capture loneliness better than others. That mix is my sweet spot.

Now the kids part. I do want them someday. Not because of pressure or timelines, but because the idea of raising a tiny human with someone I love feels meaningful. I imagine sleepy mornings, school runs, silly stories, and a home that feels full. I know it will be messy, loud, tiring, and still something I want to experience with the right partner.

What matters most to me is emotional availability. I want conversations where you can show up as yourself, without filters. I am not interested in half-hearted texting or disappearing acts disguised as modern dating. If you can laugh at your own chaos, talk openly when it is hard, and hold space for someone else’s honesty, we will get along.

Message me if:
	•	You have had a late night conversation that started with questions about reality and ended with curiosity about whether animals dream.
	•	You side-eye anyone who says they do not like music.
	•	You believe memes should count as emotional expressions.
	•	You think wandering inside a bookshop is an underrated date idea.
	•	You watch shows with the pause button ready because you love discussing scenes.

I cannot promise perfect romance or cinematic magic. What I can promise is steady banter, curious conversations, honest intentions, and a dog who will judge us both equally.

Worst case, you get a great meme and leave. Best case, we end up in a Pune cafe on a rainy evening, laughing so hard the staff begins to wonder what is going on.",3,1763475762.0,reddmatch,3,1.0,False
