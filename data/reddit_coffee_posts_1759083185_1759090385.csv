I’ve been using the La Seine X espresso machine daily for almost 3 months now. It’s an all-in-one machine (built-in grinder, scale, touchscreen, steam wand with IR sensor, even a drip coffee mode).

I thought I’d share a few takeaways so far:
✅ Love the design, it’s unique and looks great in a setup
✅ Beginner-friendly but also grows with you (pressure/flow profiling)
❌ The grinder is the weakest point (heat buildup on long sessions)
❌ Small drip tray, a bit annoying when steaming + brewing at the same time

I’m curious: would you ever consider an “all-in-one” machine like this, or do you prefer having separate grinder + espresso setup?",1,1759090054.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1nsy79s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TAZCirclejerk/comments/1nsy79s/retro_recap_the_empty_bowl_69_nice/,[Retro Recap] The Empty Bowl #69 (Nice),"Howdy all. We’re back, back again, with another Empty Bowl recap. There is no rhyme or reason to the episodes I choose. I just let the Spirit of Cereal (Booberry, obvs) move through me. But this time I chose episode 69 because it’s the funny sex number. So let us go back in time, shall we? To April 2022, and find out what our two good good Cereal Boys were up to and what the world was like in our local grocery stores. Insert TARDIS noise here. Also stick around for the end for a Real World Review from yours truly.

We start off with Justin and Dan introducing the episode in the style of the pina colada song. That’s a good song. I really learned to love it again when I was obsessed with the first Guardians of the Galaxy Mix Tape, back when I listened to it a million times while writing a Star Lord/Nova fic for every single song, anthology style. Anyway.

They were off last week and Justin claims the cereal gates opened, meaning we’re in for some very good cereal news. Fuck yes. Dan’s heart is racing a mile a minute, Justin urges him to calm down! They have a job to do! And that job is to bring us all the newest cereal news, so let’s take a deep gulp and dive in. Let’s see how many of these new cereals mentioned made it into their top and bottom lists of 2022, as recapped [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TAZCirclejerk/comments/1nmf2aw/retro_recap_the_empty_bowl_81/).

Firstly, Dan is very excited about new Cinnamon Toast Crunch news. Ooh, we’re gonna do this Nintendo Direct headlines style. Dan runs down the newest offerings from the most delicious cinnamon squares on the market:

In May, just a few short days after this aired, the world was introduced to an incredible cereal, which I was a big fan of: Cinnamon Toast Crunch Rolls. Which, if you’re not familiar, were basically Cinnamon Toast Crunch but in the shape of little cinnamon rolls. These are fucking DELICIOUS, dude. I don’t think they’re on shelves anymore, but man were they tasty. Dan reassures that these are not to be confused with Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cinnamon Rolls, which are, well, the dessert you bake. Justin jumps in and also mentions that cinnamon rolls can be a breakfast food, too. No need to “put boundaries on people”. Thank you, Hoops. Defender of the People. A true Ally. Dan makes a joke and called them a “bressert”. Good one, Dan.

Justin and Dan mention the box, calling it an Ouroboros.

https://preview.redd.it/4s4ppjvqoyrf1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b9b3b5266b4088d3bbe9dc86b3c6a7e4a0f518b

Dan mentions the Cinnamon Toast Crunch Churros cereal, which is essentially just a churro shape. These are a cinnamon roll shape. Dan posits that this is just General Mills trying to corner the market on cinnamon roll cereal, because I guess there was a Cinnabon cereal? He assumes these will taste fine, and he’s wrong. These will taste amazing. So much so, that they almost cracked Dan’s top 3 cereals of this year, later on. You’ll learn your lesson soon, young Dan Goubert. Dan makes a very good “cinn-gularity” joke that made me exhale heavily through my nose. He says he wants something new from them.

Next up in the Cinnamon Toast Crunch Universe: Swiss Miss Cinna-dust Beverage Mix. It’s just Swiss Miss with CTC flavored dust flavoring. This is GM’s second collab with Swiss Miss, last year being Lucky Charms Swiss Miss. Dan doesn’t think it’s a hot chocolate exactly, but more of a cinnamon drink, in the vein of a horchata. Speaking of, I had some insanely good horchata the other day at lunch as well as the best tacos in Central Florida. Horchata is a very underrated drink, imo. Justin doesn’t like Swiss Miss products, but he said it’s good to dump into your coffee and it’s a good vacation/hotel coffee drink.

Alrighty, still on the CTC news: a big collab between CTC and Krispy Kreme. Have you ever had a Krispy Kreme? Was it cripsy? Right, right. Krispy Kreme is introducing a Cinnamon Milk Glaze made with CTC. This is offered on a variety of their products, such as a cinnamon milk glazed donut. Or a cinnamon milk glazed donut. Or a cinnamon milk glazed donut. Or cinnamon milk chiller to wash it all down with. I wish I had had a chance to try this. There is no Krispy Kreme where I live and I’m not driving an hour just to get some. Before I moved, my best friend and I would get drunk and Uber to and from Krispy Kreme and devour a dozen hot and fresh each. Unf.

Justin says you can basically make this cinnamon milk chiller at home by taking your end milk (unhygenic, he admits) and mixing in powdered sugar. It sounds like it would give me straight up diabetes. No thanks. But Dan admits it’s a good way to recycle end milk if you don’t drink it and jokes its sustainable. Justin say it’s just for you, don’t make other people eat your potential DNA.

Okay final piece of news from CTC. And the best one. Cinnamon Toast Crunch Crocs!

https://preview.redd.it/8hcmrl2woyrf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=87cc79a396ea0d0dd1eeda0d4f0c9d0fcff1b1f5

Justin jokes that these are the Wario to the LeBron James Pebbles shoes. Which I think are hideous! Much like Dan thinks these are hideous. Which they’re both correct. I used to be a Crocs hater, but I have a pair of Sonic Crocs and I love them, they’re very comfortable. But I am also upset at missing the Gundam Crocs and how expensive they were.

https://preview.redd.it/9pabmqeyoyrf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=32970f33d08014039ec33d75ab868a8c13cd0509

Justin and Dan both simply like the gibbets (Croc charms for people who don’t know the lingo) and those are probably the best part of them. Especially the giant cereal bowl lol. The actual pattern is gross, though, which I agree with.

>Justin: Like the ribbons of cereal grease and milk.

Both of our cereal boys will attempt to get a pair, Justin says “there’s nothing I want more” and Dan solely wants a pair because he can’t wear white shoes because of how quick he gets them dirty and these come “pre-smeared with brown and tan would be a good way to mask any like mud and dirt that I step in”.

According to Justin, these are supposed to smell like cereal? Well, according to a TikTok comment Justin read.

>Dan: That sounds like a great way to ruin the smell of your favorite cereal, as it begins to meld and mix with the smell of your own… toes.

I’m gagging. Ugh.

>Dan: Cinnamon Toes Crunch, if you will. \[wheezes\]

>Justin: It’s rough. Uh… So maybe, I don’t know, if you get a pair, let us hear about it, I guess. \[chuckles\] Send— Send pics. I guess I shouldn’t be asking for foot pictures.

Weird, you’d think it would be The Middlest who would be asking for feet pics from social media….Let’s move on. Oh god, I remember this next news item. It was wild.

>Dan: This is Tropicana Crunch, and it is releasing exclusively at [tropicanacrunch.com](http://tropicanacrunch.com) on May 4th, 2022. You won’t be able to find it in stores. And of course this is a cereal made by Tropicana, the juice company, and it is billed as the “first cereal made to be used with orange juice, instead of milk”

https://preview.redd.it/wao35s97pyrf1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e59b34f629c9d60c84d6f457d8d2ef0eafea581

I remember audibly gagging when I heard this the first time when I listened to this originally. I could taste it already. I hate it. Justin gets nauseous if he drinks juice in the morning. And then makes a comment about pouring white gravy onto cereal. Never mind, this podcast sucks. I hate these visuals. God, Dan mentions how he avoids almond milk because it’s so thin and watery and posits using high pulp orange juice to add viscosity. Aaaaaahhhhh. Get me out of here. Time for a press release reading. Munch Squad found dead in Miami.

>Dan: Um, “According to the folks at Tropicana,” it says “somewhere around 15 million people have tried orange juice instead of milk before, and according to the brand survey they conducted, half of the adults who poured OJ over their cereal did so because they thought it looked like it would taste good. And more than one in three did it because they love OJ and thought it would be a good combination.” Let me just says that the word “thought” in both of those stats is doing a lot of heavy lifting.

Dan mentions that this does disrespect to previous orange cereals of the past, “like OJs in the 80s, Quangaroos, and also Cap’n Crunch’s Orange Cream Pop Crunch.” And Tropicana Crunch seems to be a honey almond cereal, instead of vanilla or orange, which would compliment the orange juice travesty you’d commit to this thing. I hate this conversation, let’s go to the next thing.

New Cherrios variety, Honey Vanilla Cheerios. Which, eagle eyed readers will remember, won Dan’s inaugural “Wait, Who?” award later that year. Next up is both Dan and Justin’s pick for Box Art of the Year, Trix Trax! With the super cool dinosaur.

https://preview.redd.it/euc9o8s8pyrf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=015708347c506704a01fd48823c4c0b2bc2a48f9

This was a tie-in with one of those Jurassic World movies, don’t remember which, don’t really care which tbh.

>Justin: And then the narrative of this, we see like some of the cereal seems to be flying out of the bowl and into the waiting T-Rex’s mouth.

Or maybe the T-Rex has cereal breath. Did you even think about that, Juice? 🤔🤔

>Dan: Yeah. Well, in the narrative of this as well, I’m not sure if I’m meant to assume that if the rabbit has front-facing eyes, he is a predator as well.

Well if the Disney hit film Zootopia taught me anything, rabbits are prey and also get abortions. More riffing on the narrative. Why does the Trix Rabbit have such a big bowl? The world will never know, y’all. Justin calls out the cereal for the laziest marbit shape, the round marbit repurposed into an egg.

>Dan: I mean with how inaccurate fossil records are, that could be what dinosaur eggs actually looked like. We don’t know.

>Justin: They could’ve looked like chewy Tic Tacs

Review time!

Fuck yes, Sonic the Hedgehog cereal. Finally I can eat >!~~out~~!< Sonic! Aw, Dan says it’s pretty disappointing. Just corn rings with marshmallows. Boo! My boy deserves better. Compares it to Quaker Honey-Os, which I’ve never had. “Very corn forward with a honeyness in the end notes”. Sounds pretty generic, unfortunately. Dan shouts out the box, but I don’t think I can find the exact box they’re talking about because the one I can find, does not have the supposed “Sonic shaped” marbit that Justin mentions. Just an emerald and a star? Which, looking closer at it, I can kinda see a Sonic head? I dunno.

https://preview.redd.it/tzinhzbdpyrf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f01bc37c256643b849676a721fb14348aa66c5c

Dan’s got a review of Cinnamon Toast Crunch Creamy Cinnamon Spread, which he says feels “almost illegally sweet”. It’s basically a jar of raw cinnamon bun batter, which sounds both delicious and disgusting. He says it’s very brown-sugar forward with like 10% cinnamon flavor.

Dan: I think in my review for the blog, I said like this tastes like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, if you were to take like and entire box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, an entire gallon of milk, and somehow use like some nuclear fusion-grade apparatus to condense it into a single spoonful, ‘cause it is that intense.

Dan made a PB&J with it, which just sounds insane. Using the CTCCTS instead of PB. I feel like I can fuck with that, actually. Next we have the Fruit Loops cereal straws. Which is exactly what it sounds like. Nothing special. Poor Dan said the package he managed to hunt down was mostly broken. Now we have another Japanese cereal sent in from a listener. Calbee Fugura, a combo of fruit and granola. This was sent to Justin’s PO Box. Do you think MBMBAM listeners send things to their PO Box(es)? I wonder what they send. I don’t even remember if they have one, it’s been a very long time since I listened to MBMBAM.

Anyway, Justin was sent two varieties. A standard fruit and granola with dried sweet potato chunks. That sounds...kinda gross, but I can see the vision. Next one was matcha flavored. Justin added some to banana bread and now I’m super interested in making that. That sounds very interesting. Speaking of their PO Box, they got sent a graphic novel called “Letters to Margaret”. I’ll let their review speak for itself:

>Dan: So this is very interesting. It’s a combination of a crossword puzzle book and a graphic novel. It’s not outwardly a cereal book, but it contains a lot of references to cereal culture and snacking culture in general, and you can tell that the author, uh Hayley Gold, really knows her stuff about… You know, like snacking wordplay and \[chuckles\] crazy uses of language.

>Justin: And the uh— Every chapter begins with a crossword puzzle, like a full crossword puzzle that you can do or not, but you’re kinda missing the point if you don’t do it. Uh and… uh the— the— Doing the puzzle kind of informs the rest of the story, ‘cause like the puzzles you completed kinda informs the rest of the story, which is very interactive in that sense, but it does add some really cool color. And also, kinda— I found— \[chuckles\] Maybe this is my attention span, but I really liked switching from doing puzzles to reading a comic book.

>Dan: Mm-hmm.

>Justin: It was like a— a much more fully— fully-rounded experience, I think. It had a little bit of everything.

>Dan: Yeah, the character has a puzzle blog, and one of the bloggers is a former cereal blogger as well. I never really felt this represented in a fictional work before.

So shoutout to Hayley Gold and “Letters to Margaret”. Seems interesting! I might have to pick it up! There’s a sequel in the works, much more focused on cereal. Wonderful!

Anyway, time for a special twist to the recap. If y’all remember, Dan raved about a Nissin cereal recently that was matcha flavored with dried strawberries and mochi pieces. He loved it, so I immediately tracked it down and ordered some. Well, it got here much quicker than I anticipated and I just had dental surgery, so I had to wait a bit longer to try it. But I figured I’m healed up enough and I can chew on one side of my mouth, so I opened it up and tried it!

https://preview.redd.it/aavvryrgpyrf1.jpg?width=6144&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdbfd75fb513432a25a5e51d3090dc8f5d15fd4b

And folks, it was delightful! The matcha flavor is very prominent in a good way. It’s like a sweetened matcha and very very yummy. Pieces stayed crunchy the entire time, which is wild, since I’m so used to cereal going soggy pretty quickly. The strawberry didn’t really add much, unfortunately, but when I did get one, it was a nice little tart bite to counterbalance the sweetness from the matcha granola chunks or whatever they are. The mochi pieces, the thing I was most interested in, were a bit of a disappointment. They all seemed to sink down to the bottom of the bowl and there weren’t as many as I hoped, so when I did get them in my spoon, it was few and far between. But the way they went from dried pieces and get rehydrated from the milk and soft again, it was lovely. So I highly recommend this.

I hope that the new H-Mart that just opened up in Orlando has it whenever I get the chance to go. I was going to go this weekend, but my TikTok feed was full of people waiting hours in line to get in so I’m gonna give it about a month before I even try.

Let’s call my partner Lars. Brother (let’s call him Andy) is a stressy, volatile kind of a person who has refused anger management and therapy despite his family encouraging it. Lars is quiet, calm person who has had a therapist for years. Andy is larger, and physically intimidating compared Lars. Andy’s like 6 foot one- I’d guess 220 pounds, and Lars has a more slight build at 5 foot eight, 140 pounds. 

Andy has a typical corporate job, whereas Lars and I are self-employed professional artists with a somewhat “glamorous life on paper” - any professional artists here will know what I mean. Andy has two young children and a wife who also has a corporate job. It was not Andy’s dream to have kids, more something he knew he had to do to keep his wife. He is a frustrated writer and had expressed jealousy of Lars’s profession in the arts. So part of his blowback toward us seems to be his jealousy and frustration. We work late, often into the wee hours. Being professional musicians is essentially shift work, going on stage late at night or having to drive long distances after shows. Andy makes a point of being loud and waking my partner up early when he can. 

Andy erupted at me once in the context of a board game and I decided I’m never playing a game with him again. We were teaching Andy this really fun game, and he decided I’d made an unfair move, all evidence aside. I’m not here to be his target. I didn’t have a conversation about it with him. I just backed off. He freaked out in his own home, and I wasn’t going to chide him there or anywhere really. I had only met him a couple times at that point. 

Next incident: Andy blew up at Lars at their father’s funeral. He literally said “my dad just died” as if it wasn’t Lars’s father’s funeral too. Andy had been shushing people around the back of the house, where his son was taking a nap. The walls of the house were two feet thick though, and Lars pointed that out. You can’t hear anything through those walls. Andy went on to apologize to Lars multiple times that day. 

Then on Lars’s birthday Andy went out of his way to be rude to me. Lars said “we’re on speaker phone with OP” and Andy said hello to my dog and not me. In that moment I saw how far gone he is, that he is using me as a target for plausible deniability as a way to punch his brother. I decided in that moment to never stay with Andy again (he has a big house and often offers his spot when we travel to see the family.) Lars was really bummed out after his brother snubbed me on his birthday. 

I don’t want to intrude on what’s a personal problem between my partner and his brother. I also don’t want to be a target. So I’ve just removed myself in as much as possible. 

Andy has this super odd, rigid communication style with me where he only talks to me about coffee (which I don’t care about) and if I try to have a normal conversation he does not respond. I think he’s only slightly less rigid in his conversation style with Lars. 

I have a very lovely relationship with their mother. Andy is snippy with his wife as well as his mother and brother- he boils over at everyone on a regular basis. 

Recent incident: Lars visited Andy while he was traveling for work and saw the name of our city on the calendar. Andy revealed he was visiting our city but hadn’t planned on telling us. Lars was bummed Andy wasn’t trying to see him. 

Most recent incident: tonight Andy did it again, not saying hello to me in a speaker phone call. I don’t want to insert myself if he doesn’t want to say hello so I didn’t speak. 

Does anyone have any advice about how I can support my partner in dealing with his brother? 

I plan on staying formal and distant as possible if Andy’s poor behavior continues. I will avoid staying at Andy’s house in the future. We want to maintain as close and positive a relationship as possible in order to be there as uncle/aunt figures to the niblings. Lars and his mother make it clear to Andy’s wife that we see his behavior and they’re here to support her. All of them try to encourage Andy to get therapy and or do anger management and he does not want to go. 

When Andy first met me, he was only father of one, maybe a little less stressed, and he was more pleasant. I think he’s an interesting person, and I give him the benefit of the doubt that he is more than his coping mechanisms, better than his worst behavior. But I refuse to be a punching bag to him, so I’ll back off as much as possible. 

Any constructive advice is appreciated. Thank you.

There is so much attention put into so many aspects of the meal; making sure that ingredients are high quality, the preparation is proper and consistent, the wines compliment the food being served, and even the ambiance is finely crafted. However when it comes to pairing coffee with the dessert I've never had anything at a restaurant that i would consider good. I understand that as someone who has worked in the coffee industry with roasters and shops for over a decade i might have a slight bias but i can also recognize that what's being served is severely lacking; And it's not even just the coffee itself but also the preparation.

I'm wondering why this is something that seems to be consistent across the board. I understand that's it not a priority for these places but it seems odd to care so much about all the other aspects of a customer's experience and then just seem to be apathetic towards this. Is it just not worth training someone on how to do it? Is it too much to cross train one or multiple of the staff on how to properly use an espresso machine / steam milk?",1,1759089820.0,KitchenConfidential,1,1.0,False

Life’s short, and honestly, why waste time on small talk when we could already be teasing each other about our questionable coffee choices or whose music taste is better? [or who tastes better ;)]

I’m 24, from India -  I tend to experiment with brewing coffee[AND my dating life], gets lost in manga [ would prefer getting lost in your eyes though] and replays movies for the soundtrack. I try to stay somewhat fit, but my real strength? Being ridiculously easy to talk to. People say I’m approachable, empathetic, and the kind of listener who actually remembers the little things.

What I’m looking for: a woman (18+) who’s up for genuine conversations, playful flirting, and maybe even something spicier if we click. IRL meets aren’t off the table either. I don’t care if you’re an introvert or extrovert - just bring some energy to keep the convo flowing, and I’ll always match it.

One small heads-up: I will eventually ask for verification. Nothing dramatic, will not ask for any identifiable photo,  just a safety thing. I hope that doesn’t put you off.

So… if tomorrow isn’t promised, what’s one thing you’d want to do TODAY?

I work full-time in IT but I’m really interested in picking up skills in barista training ☕, baking 🍰, or even bartending 🍸. I’m not looking to switch careers right now, but I do want to learn properly (not just hobby YouTube videos).

Ideally I’d like a 1–6 month course that:
	•	Is flexible (2–3 hours a day or weekend batches),
	•	Gives hands-on experience (not just theory),
	•	And could also be useful if I ever want to do side gigs (like freelancing at events, home bakery, coffee pop-ups etc.).

I’m fine with traveling to places like Goa, Himachal, Bangalore, Sikkim, Mumbai, etc. if it means a better learning experience.

So I’m curious:
	•	Has anyone here done such a course in India (barista / baking / bartending)?
	•	Were you able to manage it along with your job?
	•	Did it actually help with skills, confidence, or even making some side income?
	•	Any schools / institutes you’d recommend (or avoid)?

I go through a pack of zyns a day, and probably 400-500mg caffeine on an average day. 

As i get older i think more and more about my cardiovascular health. My vo2 max from my apple watch is 40, which is below average for a 25 year old male. My HRV is around 35 average for the year as well. 

My resting heart rate is around 70 and walking average 100-110. 

My ultimate goal is to quit nicotine completely and drink 1 cup of coffee a day, but the nicotine is extremely difficult to get off of. Especially will all the stress in my life currently

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.  
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.  
Ooh, black and yellow!  
Let's shake it up a little.  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!  
Coming!  
Hang on a second.  
Hello?  
Barry?  
Adam?  
Can you believe this is happening?  
I can't.  
I'll pick you up.  
Looking sharp.  
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.  
Sorry. I'm excited.  
Here's the graduate.  
We're very proud of you, son.  
A perfect report card, all B's.  
Very proud.  
Ma! I got a thing going here.  
You got lint on your fuzz.  
Ow! That's me!  
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.  
Bye!  
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!  
Hey, Adam.  
Hey, Barry.  
Is that fuzz gel?  
A little. Special day, graduation.  
Never thought I'd make it.  
Three days grade school, three days high school.  
Those were awkward.  
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.  
You did come back different.  
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.  
Hear about Frankie?  
Yeah.  
You going to the funeral?  
No, I'm not going.  
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.  
Such a hothead.  
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.  
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.  
That's why we don't need vacations.  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.  
Well, Adam, today we are men.  
We are!  
Bee-men.  
Amen!  
Hallelujah!  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.  
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.  
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!  
Will we pick our job today?  
I heard it's just orientation.  
Heads up! Here we go.  
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.  
Wonder what it'll be like?  
A little scary.  
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.  
This is it!  
Wow.  
Wow.  
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.  
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!  
That girl was hot.  
She's my cousin!  
She is?  
Yes, we're all cousins.  
Right. You're right.  
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.  
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.  
What do you think he makes?  
Not enough.  
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.  
What does that do?  
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.  
Saves us millions.  
Can anyone work on the Krelman?  
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.  
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.  
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.  
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.  
What's the difference?  
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.  
So you'll just work us to death?  
We'll sure try.  
Wow! That blew my mind!  
""What's the difference?""  
How can you say that?  
One job forever?  
That's an insane choice to have to make.  
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.  
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?  
Why would you question anything? We're bees.  
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.  
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?  
Like what? Give me one example.  
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.  
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.  
Wait a second. Check it out.  
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!  
Wow.  
I've never seen them this close.  
They know what it's like outside The Hive.  
Yeah, but some don't come back.  
Hey, Jocks!  
Hi, Jocks!  
You guys did great!  
You're monsters!  
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!  
I wonder where they were.  
I don't know.  
Their day's not planned.  
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.  
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.  
Right.  
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.  
It's just a status symbol.  
Bees make too much of it.  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.  
Those ladies?  
Aren't they our cousins too?  
Distant. Distant.  
Look at these two.  
Couple of Hive Harrys.  
Let's have fun with them.  
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!  
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!  
Oh, my!  
I never thought I'd knock him out.  
What were you doing during this?  
Trying to alert the authorities.  
I can autograph that.  
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?  
Yeah. Gusty.  
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.  
Six miles, huh?  
Barry!  
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.  
Maybe I am.  
You are not!  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?  
Are you bee enough?  
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.  
Hey, Honex!  
Dad, you surprised me.  
You decide what you're interested in?  
Well, there's a lot of choices.  
But you only get one.  
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.  
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.  
You get yourself into a rhythm.  
It's a beautiful thing.  
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,  
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.  
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?  
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.  
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!  
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.  
I'm not trying to be funny.  
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!  
You're gonna be a stirrer?  
No one's listening to me!  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.  
I could say anything right now.  
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!  
I'm so proud.  
We're starting work today!  
Today's the day.  
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.  
Yeah, right.  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...  
Is it still available?  
Hang on. Two left!  
One of them's yours! Congratulations!  
Step to the side.  
What'd you get?  
Picking crud out. Stellar!  
Wow!  
Couple of newbies?  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!  
Make your choice.  
You want to go first?  
No, you go.  
Oh, my. What's available?  
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.  
Any chance of getting the Krelman?  
Sure, you're on.  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.  
Wax monkey's always open.  
The Krelman opened up again.  
What happened?  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.  
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!  
Oh, this is so hard!  
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.  
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?  
Barry!  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...  
What happened to you?  
Where are you?  
I'm going out.  
Out? Out where?  
Out there.  
Oh, no!  
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?  
Another call coming in.  
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.  
Hey, guys.  
Look at that.  
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.  
Thank you.  
OK.  
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.  
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.  
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.  
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!  
That's awful.  
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!  
 All right, launch positions!  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!  
Black and yellow!  
Hello!  
You ready for this, hot shot?  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.  
Wind, check.  
Antennae, check.  
Nectar pack, check.  
Wings, check.  
Stinger, check.  
Scared out of my shorts, check.  
OK, ladies,  
let's move it out!  
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!  
All of you, drain those flowers!  
Wow! I'm out!  
I can't believe I'm out!  
So blue.  
I feel so fast and free!  
Box kite!  
Wow!  
Flowers!  
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.  
Roses!  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.  
Stand to the side, kid.  
It's got a bit of a kick.  
That is one nectar collector!  
Ever see pollination up close?  
No, sir.  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.  
See that? It's a little bit of magic.  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.  
Cool.  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?  
Copy that visual.  
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.  
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?  
Affirmative.  
That was on the line!  
This is the coolest. What is it?  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.  
It smells good.  
Not like a flower, but I like it.  
Yeah, fuzzy.  
Chemical-y.  
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.  
My sweet lord of bees!  
Candy-brain, get off there!  
Problem!  
Guys!  
This could be bad.  
Affirmative.  
Very close.  
Gonna hurt.  
Mama's little boy.  
You are way out of position, rookie!  
Coming in at you like a missile!  
Help me!  
I don't think these are flowers.  
Should we tell him?  
I think he knows.  
What is this?!  
Match point!  
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!  
Yowser!  
Gross.  
There's a bee in the car!  
Do something!  
I'm driving!  
Hi, bee.  
He's back here!  
He's going to sting me!  
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!  
He blinked!  
Spray him, Granny!  
What are you doing?!  
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.  
I gotta get home.  
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!  
Ken, could you close the window please?  
Ken, could you close the window please?  
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.  
What was that?  
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!  
That is diabolical.  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.  
What's number one? Star Wars?  
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.  
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.  
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.  
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.  
Wait! Stop! Bee!  
Stand back. These are winter boots.  
Wait!  
Don't kill him!  
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!  
Why does his life have less value than yours?  
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?  
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.  
My brochure!  
There you go, little guy.  
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.  
 Put that on your resume brochure.  
My whole face could puff up.  
Make it one of your special skills.  
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.  
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?  
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.  
You could put carob chips on there.  
Bye.  
Supposed to be less calories.  
Bye.  
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.  
All right, here it goes.  
Nah.  
What would I say?  
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.  
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.  
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!  
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.  
How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!  
Hi!  
I'm sorry. You're talking.  
Yes, I know.  
You're talking!  
I'm so sorry.  
No, it's OK. It's fine.  
I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.  
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.  
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!  
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.  
And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.  
That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.  
Yeah.  
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!  
I just want to say I'm grateful.  
I'll leave now.  
Wait! How did you learn to do that?  
What?  
The talking thing.  
Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.  
That's very funny.  
Yeah.  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.  
Anyway... Can I... get you something?  
Like what?  
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?  
I don't want to put you out.  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.  
It's just coffee.  
I hate to impose.  
Don't be ridiculous!  
Actually, I would love a cup.  
Hey, you want rum cake?  
I shouldn't.  
Have some.  
No, I can't.  
Come on!  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.  
Where?  
These stripes don't help.  
You look great!  
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.  
Are you all right?  
No.  
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.  
He finally gets there.  
He runs up the steps into the church.  
The wedding is on.  
And he says, ""Watermelon?  
I thought you said Guatemalan.  
Why would I marry a watermelon?""  
Is that a bee joke?  
That's the kind of stuff we do.  
Yeah, different.  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?  
About work? I don't know.  
I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.  
I know how you feel.  
You do?  
Sure.  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.  
Really?  
My only interest is flowers.  
Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.  
Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?  
You're in Sheep Meadow!  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!  
No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.  
Why do girls put rings on their toes?  
Why not?  
It's like putting a hat on your knee.  
Maybe I'll try that.  
You all right, ma'am?  
Oh, yeah. Fine.  
Just having two cups of coffee!  
Anyway, this has been great.  
Thanks for the coffee.  
Yeah, it's no trouble.  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.  
Are you...?  
Can I take a piece of this with me?  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.  
Thanks!  
Yeah.  
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.  
OK, Barry.  
And thank you so much again... for before.  
Oh, that? That was nothing.  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...  
This can't possibly work.  
He's all set to go.  
We may as well try it.  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.  
Sounds amazing.  
It was amazing!  
It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.  
Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!  
Giant, scary humans!  
What were they like?  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.  
They eat crazy giant things.  
They drive crazy.  
Do they try and kill you, like on TV?  
Some of them. But some of them don't.  
How'd you get back?  
Poodle.  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.  
You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.  
Well...  
Well?  
Well, I met someone.  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?  
A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!  
No, no, no, not a wasp.  
Spider?  
I'm not attracted to spiders.  
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.  
So who is she?  
She's... human.  
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.  
Her name's Vanessa.  
Oh, boy.  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!  
We're not dating.  
You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!  
She saved my life! And she understands me.  
This is over!  
Eat this.  
This is not over! What was that?  
They call it a crumb.  
It was so stingin' stripey!  
And that's not what they eat.  
That's what falls off what they eat!  
You know what a Cinnabon is?  
No.  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...  
Sit down!  
...really hot!  
Listen to me!  
We are not them! We're us.  
There's us and there's them!  
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?  
There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!  
You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!  
Thinking bee.  
Thinking bee.  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!  
There he is. He's in the pool.  
You know what your problem is, Barry?  
I gotta start thinking bee?  
How much longer will this go on?  
It's been three days! Why aren't you working?  
I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.  
What life? You have no life!  
You have no job. You're barely a bee!  
Would it kill you to make a little honey?  
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.  
Martin, would you talk to him?  
Barry, I'm talking to you!  
You coming?  
Got everything?  
All set!  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.  
Don't be too long.  
Watch this!  
Vanessa!  
We're still here.  
I told you not to yell at him.  
He doesn't respond to yelling!  
Then why yell at me?  
Because you don't listen!  
I'm not listening to this.  
Sorry, I've gotta go.  
Where are you going?  
I'm meeting a friend.  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?  
Bye.  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.  
They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?  
To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!  
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.  
A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?  
No. All right, I've got one.  
How come you don't fly everywhere?  
It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.  
All right, your turn.  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!  
You don't have that?  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.  
Oh, my.  
Dumb bees!  
You must want to sting all those jerks.  
We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.  
So you have to watch your temper.  
Very carefully.  
You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?  
Yeah.  
What is wrong with you?!  
It's a bug.  
He's not bothering anybody.  
Get out of here, you creep!  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?  
It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.  
You've really got that down to a science.  
I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.  
I'll bet.  
What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?  
How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?  
Is he that actor?  
I never heard of him.  
Why is this here?  
For people. We eat it.  
You don't have enough food of your own?  
Well, yes.  
How do you get it?  
Bees make it.  
I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!  
There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!  
It's organic.  
It's our-ganic!  
It's just honey, Barry.  
Just what?!  
Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

Almost.

Hey, Blood.  
Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.  
Wow!  
I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.  
Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in.  
It's a close community.  
Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.  
What if you get in trouble?  
You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!

This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.  
Oh, Barry, stop.  
Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.  
Do these look like rumors?  
That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?  
He's been talking to humans.  
What? Talking to humans?!  
He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!  
Make out? Barry!  
We do not.  
You wish you could.  
Whose side are you on?  
The bees!  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.  
Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?  
I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!  
Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked  
your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.  
I remember that.  
What right do they have to our honey?  
We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?  
Sting them where it really hurts.  
In the face! The eye!  
That would hurt.  
No.  
Up the nose? That's a killer.  
There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.

A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.  
Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this""?  
Bees have never been afraid to change the world.  
What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.  
We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.  
How old are you?  
The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.  
You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.  
It's a common name. Next week...  
He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...

It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!  
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?  
Quiet, please.  
Actual work going on here.  
Is that that same bee?  
Yes, it is!  
I'm helping him sue the human race.  
Hello.  
Hello, bee.  
This is Ken.  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.  
Why does he talk again?  
Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.  
But it's our yogurt night!  
Bye-bye.  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!  
You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!  
Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.  
Frosting...  
How many sugars?  
Just one. I try not to use the competition.  
So why are you helping me?  
Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.  
Those are great, if you're three.  
And artificial flowers.  
Oh, those just get me psychotic!  
Yeah, me too.  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.  
Bees must hate those fake things!  
Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.  
Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.  
This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.  
I guess.  
You sure you want to go through with it?  
Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty!  
It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.

All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.  
All right. Case number 4475,  
Superior Court of New York,  
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?  
A privilege.  
Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.  
Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.  
I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!  
Talking bee!  
How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?  
They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!  
Mr. Benson?  
Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.  
Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!  
I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!  
I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!  
Call your first witness.  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.  
I suppose so.  
I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!  
Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.  
Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.  
I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?  
No.  
I couldn't hear you.  
No.  
No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.  
They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.  
You mean like this?  
Bears kill bees!  
How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?  
I was with a band called The Police.  
But you've never been a police officer, have you?  
No, I haven't.  
No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.  
Oh, please.  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!  
Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.  
Thank you. Thank you.  
I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?  
Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?  
Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!  
This isn't a goodfella.  
This is a badfella!  
Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!  
Order in this court!  
You're all thinking it!  
Order! Order, I say!  
Say it!  
Mr. Liotta, please sit down!  
I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.  
Are we doing everything right, legally?  
I'm a florist.  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.  
To a great team!  
Well, hello.  
Ken!  
Hello.  
I didn't think you were coming.  
No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,  
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.  
Oh, that was lucky.  
There's a little left. I could heat it up.  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.  
That's where I usually sit. Right... there.  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.  
You think I don't see what you're doing?  
I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.  
Do we?  
Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.  
That's just what I was thinking about doing.  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.  
Yeah, you do that.  
Look at that.  
You know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games.  
What's that?  
Italian Vogue.  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.  
A lot of ads.  
Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here!  
I love the smell of flowers.  
How do you like the smell of flames?!  
Not as much.  
Water bug! Not taking sides!  
Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!  
This is pathetic!  
I've got issues!  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!  
You're bluffing.  
Am I?  
Surf's up, dude!  
Poo water!  
That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings!  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!  
You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!  
We need to talk! He's just a little bee!  
And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!  
Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?  
 No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!

I'm flying into Florence, taking the high speed rail to Bologna then Venice, and then flying out of Venice. I'll be staying 3 nights in each city, which I know isn't a lot by the standards of this subreddit but I'm happy with it. For my own planning, I'm trying to not pack in too many things to do each day. I'm going for a relaxing trip, eating good food, and drinking lots of coffee. In particular, if you have any recommendations for places to read a book that'd be great. Here's a list of the things I'm planning to do in each city, roughly ranked by priority. Let me know what you think:

Florence:

* Uffizi and Gallileo museums

* Ponte Vecchio shopping

* Visiting the Boboli gardens

* Eating somewhere around the Mercato Centrale Firenze food market

* Pizza del Duomo

Bologna:

* Cooking class, maybe here? https://www.cookingschoolbologna.com/blog/

* Eating somewhere around the Quadrilatero food market

* Visiting the Archiginnasio Municipal Library

* Visiting the Villa Spada gardens

* Maybe a food tour?

Venice:

* Arsenal museum

* Saint Mark's Basillica

* Doge's palace

* Exploring the area around the Ponte di Rialto bridge

* Generally stopping at lots of places for cicchetti

Even with my plan of relaxing, this itinerary might be a little light. If you have any ideas let me know!",1,1759089633.0,ItalyTravel,1,1.0,False

I work full-time in IT but I’m really interested in picking up skills in barista training ☕, baking 🍰, or even bartending 🍸. I’m not looking to switch careers right now, but I do want to learn properly (not just hobby YouTube videos).

Ideally I’d like a 1–6 month course that:
	•	Is flexible (2–3 hours a day or weekend batches),
	•	Gives hands-on experience (not just theory),
	•	And could also be useful if I ever want to do side gigs (like freelancing at events, home bakery, coffee pop-ups etc.).

I’m fine with traveling to places. If it means a better learning experience.

So I’m curious:
	•	Has anyone here done such a course in India (barista / baking / bartending)?
	•	Were you able to manage it along with your job?
	•	Did it actually help with skills, confidence, or even making some side income?
	•	Any schools / institutes you’d recommend (or avoid)?

Would love to hear your experiences 🙌

One of the main reasons is how often traits like ""nurturing"" and ""selflessness"" are gendered and how those traits seem to translate into an expectation that women, specifically mothers, must sacrifice parts of themselves, and that it’s just... normal.

What really solidified this feeling for me was watching what happened to a close friend of mine. She had always been career-driven and would talk to me for hours about her goals. I remember how excited she was when she finally broke into her field it was her dream, and she used to talk about it all the time. She was one of the most driven, passionate people I knew. We used to body double and work side-by-side for hours, supporting each other through the grind. We had long conversations about our career goals and how we wanted to make a meaningful impact. She was also incredibly social and active, always out for coffee, engaging in her hobbies, seeing friends - this was the rhythm of her life, even after long workdays.

Then she got married to another professional, and within a year, she left her job completely that would have been the perfect foot in the door to her career. Her social life evaporated. Her hobbies? Gone out of the window. It’s now incredibly hard to even reach her and our conversations that used to be for hours are now cut incredibly short to a mere ‘I’m fine’. 

I get one-sentence replies where we used to talk for hours. It honestly hurts. I’m watching someone I deeply cared about and connected with become a shadow of who she used to be and I don’t feel like I can even bring it up. If I question any of it or even wonder aloud whether this sacrifice was necessary or fair, I risk being labeled as bitter or judgmental. And that’s what terrifies me: this cultural zone where we can’t even question the systems or expectations without being branded as unsupportive. Where a woman can give up everything her identity, her dreams, her joy and everyone around her just smiles and says, “She’s doing what’s best for her family.”

Meanwhile, her husband’s life has barely changed. He’s advancing in his career, living in a clean, comfortable home, coming home to meals, to a well-managed household all made possible because she gave up everything to support his trajectory. And this setup is so normalised it’s revolting. 

I don’t want that for myself. I don’t believe that being a woman should automatically come with a life of self-erasure.",8,1759089318.0,childfree,0,1.0,False

Hi. So lately I've been thinking a lot about harm reduction in terms of my life. Dreaming is in a lot of ways better than a lot my other maladaptive coping skills, like alcohol/drug use or self injury.  While it is not ideal or healthy, I am also aware that it's not actively harmful in a big way.

The biggest problem I see harm wise (other than the dissociation from my life and avoidance/isolation, obviously) is that my MDing nearly always takes place in my bed with me lying stationary for hours at a time. I fidget with my legs and arms, but the majority of the movement is in my facial expressions. It's horrifying for me to admit that, and super strange to think of what I look like during these episodes.  I can be ""down"" for upwards of 2 days, with short breaks to use the bathroom or eat or smoke a cigarette. I also tend to drink an excessive amount of coffee during these times too.

I'm not young anymore, in fact I'm close to 40 years old. There is a very real and measurable amount of damage that sedentary lifestyles can produce, not to mention that I am overweight by probably 50lbs and am a heavy nicotine user.

After all the rambling, I guess my question is whether anyone else sees this as a problem or is it just me? Has anyone ""improved"" their MD to include regular exercise or fitness? Sometimes the only thing that gets me out of bed is a panic attack that I'm having a stroke or my heart is failing from lying prone for so long.

I want to date but feel afraid of being an inconvenience,"I (27F) am self employed in an arts-related field and do earn some money, and it's enough for my monthly expenses (including bills), but it's objectively not a lot. It helps that I don't have to pay rent, I live alone in an inherited condo (with enough space for another person in case it ever comes to that). If you were to include how much I'd be spending on rent, my monthly earnings would average out at something slightly above minimum wage.

I'm working on improving the monetary situation, told myself I wouldn't date until it gets better, but I've been feeling quite depressed because I'm lonely (in a way that having friends doesn't help) and miss having a special someone. I've got no idea what to expect since the last time I dated was 9 years ago. I don't have any expensive hobbies or habits and cook at home, so money's not an issue for me. However, I'm scared that it would be a turnoff for men. I don't think I could budget for anything more than going out for coffee, and I don't want to be an inconvenience to anyone.

I wake up, 6:35 AM, just like every other day. I shower, put my clothes on and head downstairs. No dishes to clean today, I notice as I start my coffee. What a wonderful way to begin the day. As I work hard on my device, I sip my coffee. Nothing out of the ordinary today, just like every other day. After dinner I head to bed with a book in hand.

Another day. Always love to start with a shower and getting ready. Feels good to get that out of the way before starting even the most menial of tasks. Dishes in the sink again, I might have to say something. I start my coffee and get working, lots done today! Dinner was fantastic tonight (note – write down recipe). I love falling asleep just listening to the sound of my fan lightly spinning in the night, occasionally broken up by the sound of coughing.

Every day is the same. I slap my 7 AM alarm off as I hop out of bed. I should probably unload the dishwasher this morning, but I’ll save it for later. Coffee starts dripping as I open my device and get to work. Routines are the key to happiness; I was once told. Dinner leaves me wanting more, but I know my limits and would not want to be rude. I fall asleep wondering if my dreams will be as fantastical as the novel I am reading.

10:32 AM. Alarm didn’t go off today. It happens. Coffee was already made when I got downstairs. Did I leave the pot out yesterday? Not important, I am already 2 hours behind schedule. No dishes to worry about today, so I quickly shower and get ready to work. Dinner is alright, but I’m distracted by the light on in the closet.

Bright and early. Coffee in the pot, showered, ready, and starting work. I’ll have to clean those dishes soon, but I’d rather not. I slipped up at dinner tonight, prepared two plates instead of one.

Background info: I (45f) am 5’5” and I have put on 25ish lbs that will not go away, most likely due to peri as I have been eating healthier, lifting weights etc more than ever before. I have been on HRT since March 2024 (not sure if that has anything to do with my situation, just thought it would be worth mentioning). I started IF in June of 2024 doing 16:8 and started slipping a bit around March of 2025 and began having heavy cream in my coffee in the morning but still no food except between noon and 8pm. It feels pretty manageable and I did lose about 8 pounds over the year. My progress stalled (maybe because of the dirty fasting?) and my scale shows that during that time, I lost weight but also muscle mass which surprised me because I have been lifting weights regularly. I started a Pilates strength program that I love, but the nutritionist with the program says women should not drink coffee on an empty stomach or work out fasted. I also listened to a podcast with Dr Stacy Sims and she says the same thing. According to her, most IF studies are based off of men and the way their bodies work - women’s hormones and age are a completely different ballgame. The only time
I have to workout is in the morning, between 5am and 6am. I always felt fine working out fasted but seems like it was counterproductive if I am losing muscle mass. If I eat beforehand, I feel like I have to get up even earlier and then I am more hungry throughout the day. Moving my window to stop eating earlier is not feasible for me. For some reason I need an evening meal, I don’t see me being able to cut that out. Plus that is really the only time we get a chance to sit down together as a family. I mentioned earlier that I have stopped IF for a few months and while I haven’t weighed myself, I have gained an inch or so back around my stomach. I guess I would just love to hear from other women my age to see what has been working for you.. not sure if I should go back to IF or if this is just how it is for me now. TIA!

Said 'they don't have the authority to arrest him' because an officer wasn't present at the time of the assault, even though we have video footage of the incident from 2 angles.","crossposted because I can't post in my city subreddit. Location: Indianapolis, Indiana

I know it sounds stupid, because it is.

The assault occurred at roughly 11am today. It was captured on video from 2 different angles. The police were called, a report was made. The man who threw the coffee had escaped but the authorities were informed of the incident and shown the footage.

About 3 hours later, I see the guy from the footage in the bushes. I go outside and confirm that it is the exact man... 6'2, black, tan shirt and ripped jeans. I immediately call 911 and say ""hey the guy who threw coffee at my coworker is back on the property please send the cops.""

The cop arrives, a shorter redhead man with a beard. I'm waiting with my phone in hand with the two videos. He tells me to back off and approaches the guy. I'm giddy, thinking 'we got him'

I give the cop his space, but I overhear him telling the guy ""a private citizen is asking you to leave..."" I interjected, ""no, we want to press charges. he's on video throwing scalding hot coffee on my coworker a few hours ago, the police were already here.""

the cop shut me down and wouldn't let me speak. He insisted that he 'doesn't have the authority to make an arrest because an officer wasn't present at the time of the assault.'

obviously this is retarded. I tell him, ""I have it on video, he's the guy, wearing the same outfit...' this cop is shouting me down. He's treating me like a criminal. I literally call 911 again as the criminal is walking away and said, ""i need a supervisor... the cops are letting a guy go who threw coffee on my coworker. I have everything on video and the cops won't even listen to me.""

a supervisor NEVER comes, but he calls back. He backs up his boys, says ""it has to go through the prosecutors before we make an arrest""

I need a reality check,"What's normal in terms of splitting chores with your husband if he works full-time and you work part-time? How do you do it? Right now, the unspoken arrangement I have with my husband is basically I do everything, and instead of helping me, he pays a cleaner to come once a week.   
  
My husband works extremely long hours and travels often for a week at a time. He doesn't do any chores around the house. He'll wash his own clothes about once a month, and occasionally load the dishwasher at night, and that's about it. 

The dirty coffee cups pile up in his home office (a room that has literally not been cleaned in over 3 years because the only time I or our cleaner could clean it, he's working in there). He'll just leave whatever food or drink container he was using lying around the house for someone else to clean up after him. 

I keep a very organized house because it really stresses me out not to be able to find things. So he benefits from always being able to find what he needs. Except after he uses whatever he needs, he'll never put it back in it's designated place, so I can't find it when I need it. It falls on me to pick up after him the way I pick up after my toddler. But to be fair, he'll do it if I tell him to do it. But he needs to be told.  

I'm responsible for organizing, cleaning (along with my once a week cleaner), grocery shopping, laundry, I work part time, I do morning, night and middle-of-the-night routines with my child, cook all the meals for our daughter, do all the grocery shopping, make all my child's doctors appointments, give her baths, make sure her nails are cut and her shoes fit etc.

None of this is to say that my husband doesn't help. When something breaks in the house, he's on it. When our kitchen flooded he got it fixed super fast. When I asked him to be more involved with the care of our daughter, he told me to hire a nanny. So I did. She comes for 5 hours a day so I can catch up on all the chores and do my part-time work. That's very helpful, but something just feels off.

I just need a reality check. Should I step-up and stop complaining since I only work part-time and I have hired help? Should he be doing more chores around the house even though he's paying for a cleaner once week? How do you guys split chores in your homes? Is there a system? What's fair? I have no idea. I grew up in a very dysfunctional home and basically raised myself. Everything I know about maintaining a home, having proper hygiene, social skills, etc. I had to figure out by myself. I did the best I could, and there's so much I still don't know. ",2,1759088747.0,Mommit,9,1.0,False

I grew up in a household on an income of around £120,000 GBP (my dad was on the executives board at a really good college/university, I believe he was making around £80,000. my mum on the other hand worked as a child therapist-with her profession being in play therapy). the house has been paid off and so have all our cars so I was used to having a lot of money spent on me and my sisters as a child (holidays 5x a year, newest clothes, public schools however we had tutors, car at 16, big big birthday celebrations; I'm sure you get the point). however, as I have grown older I feel like I have wanted for so much stuff due to being so spoiled, and now I'm at the point where expensive things have lost value for me. for insight I have little source of income. my parents wanted me to get a job so I could learn life skills and boost my CV, and on top of that I have a savings account they pay into every month. (I say savings because that's what it is really for, but it's used as a normal bank account). again, for insight: I make around £700.00 a month on my job, due to limited hours because of college. now... here's where I think I have a spending problem.

I go through money like it means nothing. ""don't pay me back for dinner it's fine"", ""I think I'm going to get that hoodie in all 3 styles available"", I make mood boards and plan my outfits so I never repeat outfits, whenever something is trending I keep up-i splurge. I'd like to give an example, I bought all the new APPLE 2025 tech when it released (yes the mini accessories too), last week I spent £1,500.00 GBP on clothes (around that), and I'm constantly going out for expensive coffees, cute café dinners here and there and overpriced parlours. I want to start saving my money to help build myself a foundation for life; I just feel I cannot stop spending it's like an urge in me!! my friends think I'm just struggling-they think I am irresponsible but it's ok because I have parents who can afford that lifestyle, but I feel like this is a real issue. I just hate seeing people not have necessities, when I'm upset over not having my wants?! I'm not shaming myself for having that money-but for being so irresponsible and stupid with it, yeah.

my question is, is this an issue that I maybe need to overcome to better myself and I really do just have no value of money, or is this just how I live my life because I was brought up like this?

I saw the two finger test, but I don’t really understand that because I can get two fingers under my legs no matter how under or overinflated it is, and I also saw the “1-.5 inches”(?) from the wheelchair/seat to where I’m sitting on the cushion, but that doesn’t sound right?? That sounds like the cushion would be really flat to me, but I don’t know. And also, when they say “adjust your position” every 15-30 minutes sitting, what does that really mean? Cuz I know they say side to side, but I feel like I’m constantly moving like leaning forward to get my coffee, leaning sideways to move my computer, but I still am getting a new pressure sore!!! 🩻🔬😣 I don’t want to get a pressure sore ever again.

Instead of accepting this as normal, I built an AI agent to handle it.

**Now here's what happens:**

I type any project name into my custom dashboard and get a complete research report in 5 minutes. 

The AI:

* Automatically finds all project data across 8+ professional APIs
* Calculates complex financial ratios and risk metrics
* Cross-references security audits and regulatory concerns
* Analyzes market conditions for proper context
* Generates comprehensive summaries that actually make sense

**The time savings are insane.** 

What used to take me most of a day now happens while I grab coffee.

**Here's the bigger point:** This approach works for any repetitive, data-heavy process your business relies on.

Market research, competitive analysis, lead qualification, compliance monitoring, if you're manually gathering and synthesizing information, you're burning time and money.

Things I think I want: Ease, ability to make multiple drink types, steam milk, longevity and limited plastic. I believe plastic is causing a lot of health issues and I want to get away from it but options seem limited and maybe I’m over thinking this. 

I looked at the Breville Bambino plus and that seems simple enough but plastic, looked at the express impress as well. I’ve glanced at the Rancilio Silvia and I’d be willing to pay that if it’s all metal and repairable. I’ve been looking for weeks and reading here but I just can’t figure out what is right for me.

I kind of enjoy the fact that I don’t understand French because as I walked down the street in M Pestered by huddle or vendors for lack better word I have no idea what they’re saying so I just keep walking. I think I do a good job of not looking like A for us so I would do a better job of looking like a tourist. I didn’t have a white hat on and maybe if I didn’t wear a messenger bag but it’s a tiny bag. I just really need to hold a lot of stuff since I’ll be out all day today Anyway I ended up restaurant and was able to order a croissant with butter and jam and a coffee which is gonna be the perfect day it’s also very warm out and I started my period.

I’ve been making it a point to not walk the streets in Paris with my headphones on, mainly because I would like to feel and hear the ambience and atmosphere. It seems like everyone here is also walking with their phone in hand and looking at routes to tell them where to go. I ordered jam and butter and croissant in French today and loved how patient the server was with me. I could never expect this from people in NYC.

I think this is a good place to go if I wanted to relax and still have the city vibe: but moving to Paris especially would not be a great idea unless I had a ton of money. 

A nice man helped me figure out how to swipe into the metro today, well actually he swiped for me but I think I know what to do now. I think that was the one thing I was dreading most which is looking dumb and not knowing how to swipe in but one was there to witness really so that was nice. Let’s see how it goes with the RER. Regardless, now I have one of those cool card passes as a souvenir.

WOW! I was able to figure out the ticket situation for the RER C just by being brave and asking a French man if he spoke English. He told me that the RER tickets are the same as the metro! This is going to make traveling in Paris so much easier. I think I was confused the first time around because the stallls were dated 

I’m afraid of coming back to NYC and forgetting all the things I’ve processed here because I feel like I need to keep up with everyone. This morning I was sitting at the cafe with the most delicious croissant butter and jam thinking that I don’t have to live by anyone else’s pace but mine.

I’m starting to think that reservations stress me out more than anything. Maybe I should try to do the least reserving as possible and live my life freely.

I wonder if any of the rocks at Versailles were stepped on by Marie Antoinette.

It makes me sad to think that there’s just too many things in this world to learn and understand and no human could ever earn all of them in one lifetime for example, the boulders and bricks that I’m walking on at Versailles Palace someone probably knows a lot about Versailles Palace, including these bricksand these boulders and what they’re made of and who brought them here I will probably never know as much as the extent of what they know and that’s really sad for me

Even French dogs not being leashed says a lot. And the fact that people can just sit along the wall of the Seine without being scared of being pushed in also says a lot. As I was sitting along the Seine and sipping on my soy milk box, I couldn’t help but cry when people on their fairies were coming through and waving. It just made me feel like regardless of who we all are and where we come from that human connection is so important.

And the streets at night just so similar to Ho Chi Minh City. It makes me wonder what you know was like before France colonized.

I’m also noticing that a lot of parents walk hand and hand in hand with their children and it’s just so sweet to me.

It’s a bit wild to me that it’s taken me years to realize that takes me just so long to get from New York City to France as it does to get from New York City to California. Also, it’s seems to me like the French really like their fried chicken.

I passed by Passage Brady today and couldn’t help but think maybe in another life I could have had a partner with me to eat Pakistani food with there. Oh well. 

Tomorrow, I have a full day in Paris before I fly home. I want to make sure I remember the following when I get home: TV is the devil (lol). And life can be French. And reservations are meant to help you, not cause you anxiety. ",1,1759088071.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

1nsxc4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedForYou/comments/1nsxc4l/does_finish_quantum_dishwasher_detergent_really/,Does Finish Quantum Dishwasher Detergent Really Deliver Sparkle?,"Testing the Finish sgrevfd-324 Dishwasher Detergent has been a daily part of my kitchen routine for a few weeks now, and I’ve got a lot to say. This isn't the kind of review written after a single use; I’ve been putting these dishwashing tablets to the test with everything from baked-on lasagna pans to coffee-stained mugs. With its flashy promise of Activblu technology and three separate chamber actions, it sounded like a game-changer. The reality delivers in many ways, but it’s not without some quirks.

**First Impressions and Packaging**  
Opening the box, I immediately noticed the sleek packaging. While it claims the design may vary, mine came in a sturdy, resealable bag that kept moisture out—a very practical touch for something designed to be stored near a humid dishwasher. The tablets themselves are visually appealing, with three distinct chambers housing a powder, a gel, and a vibrant liquid powerball. It’s like they wanted each tablet to scream, “I mean business!” The compact size also fits perfectly in most standard dishwasher detergent slots, which is surprisingly not something all detergents get right.

**Highlights**  
- Highly effective against stubborn, baked-on, and dried-on food.  
- No pre-soaking or pre-rinsing necessary—perfect for time-strapped households.  
- Works remarkably well even on shorter dishwasher cycles.  

[Check Finish sgrevfd-324 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b0857xkm2m/)

**Performance in Daily Use**  
Dishes after dinner parties are where these tabs truly stand out. I had a casserole dish that hadn’t seen soap in over 24 hours—usually, my dishwasher cries for mercy at this point. But with one tablet of this detergent, the finish (no pun intended) was impressive. The three power actions definitely seem to work: the powder tackled stubborn residues, the gel addressed the greasy messes, and the liquid powerball left a noticeable shine, even on glassware. The claim of delivering the cleaning power of an overnight soak honestly holds up. 

To really push it, I threw in something I usually hand-wash: a mug stained with dried tea rings. To my surprise, it came out gleaming, as if trying to say, “Tea stains? What tea stains?” On the other hand, I noticed that while glass protection did its job well, some etched glass still looked a bit cloudy. Perhaps it’s unrealistic to expect miracles on already-damaged items, but it’s something for perfectionists to reckon with.

**Positives**  
- Impressive shine enhancement on glassware and dishes.  
- Perfectly designed for short or quick wash cycles.  
- Effective power blend of a powder, gel, and liquid in one tab.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Not ideal for etched or heavily worn glass items.  
- The scent, while not overwhelming, comes across as a bit strong for sensitive noses.  
- While the resealable bag works great, I couldn’t help but wish for a smaller option for compact storage space.

**Strength Against Alternative Offerings**  
If I were to compare these tabs to others I’ve tried, like Cascade Platinum or Kirkland Signature's dishwasher pods, these come in strong. While Cascade often leaves behind a peculiar film on my stainless steel items, these tabs don’t. And when compared to Kirkland, the shine delivered here feels just more noticeable, though Kirkland might edge out slightly on price for the quantity. The unique trifecta of scrubbing, degreasing, and shining in one small tab sets these apart from many competitors. Yet, in fairness, those sensitive to chemical odors might still lean toward alternatives with milder scents.  

**Price Performance**  
Considering the features versus competitors, the value is solid. While this may not be the cheapest detergent option available, it packs efficiency, innovation, and consistent performance into every tablet. Compared to switching between multiple cleaners for different needs (e.g., a separate rinse aid or pre-rinse spray), this could streamline your dishwashing arsenal, saving both time and money in the long run.

Married for 18 years, with kids, and currently navigating a long-standing dead bedroom situation. While our marriage is strong in most areas (co-parenting, communication, day-to-day life), the lack of intimacy has taken a real toll over the past few years.

I've tried everything — patience, open communication, even encouraging medical support, which led to brief improvements but ultimately returned to the same status quo. After a lot of internal struggle and difficult conversations, my spouse and I had an open, honest talk about where things stand. About four months ago, we agreed (with clearly defined boundaries) that I could explore discreet companionship outside of our marriage. It wasn’t easy, but it’s where we’ve landed.

* Travel and food explorer
* Chill, drama-free, and not looking to juggle multiple situations

I’m hoping to meet someone mature, kind, and in a similar space. Ideally, we click and build something discreet, respectful, and mutually beneficial.

""Part of the fun of working in the digital space for a physical location is that the research is on the ground.""

When his bar needed a Downtown LA guide, David's research involved eating burgers and pizza, having beers, discovering coffee spots, and talking with local owners. Then he'd return home to translate those experiences into design work (including a 3D gopher head for the Golden Gopher bar).

His key insight: ""That intersection of adventures in person with people is really what translates to better design and more fun design in the digital space.""

This reminded me that I've been trying to create entirely from behind my screen, and maybe that's why things feel stale. The richness of creative output comes from the richness of lived experience.

Anyone else find their best creative work comes from real-world experiences rather than just desk research?

· Playing with local models like Llama or Mistral.
· Interested in the ethics, the future of this tech, or just the pure ""how does this even work?!"" of it all.
· Working in the field, studying it, or just a curious hobbyist.

I'd be down for:

This sounds a bit much, I get it. 
First our situation,  my mil lives with us. She has alzheimers (dementia) and can't live on her own anymore. She lives in a annex she shares with her beloved cat. We cook for her, drive her to her appointments, take care of her medication, clean and wash for her, these are all things she can't do by herself anymore. She is cognitively still pretty ok, she can say what she wants and doesn't want. 

Her two siblings live in another country, they talked to each other and decided that they want to come over once a month for a week to spend more time with her. They believe she is not doing enough and they want to step in. 
The thing is, my mil is on a strict routine, she thrives with this. We take two walks daily, with our dog, we go to the store to pick up things she needs. On Wednesday we go to a storecenter close by to get lunch and coffee. On Sunday we go to mac Donald's, which she loves. 
Nothing too much and nothing too long because that interferes with her routine. 

When her siblings come here, they will take her all day out, go sightseeing, often for 6 to 8 hours a day. She enjoys this but also gets very tired and the week after she needs a lot more care, she forgets more and wants to basically lie on bed all day. They buy her new stuff, which is sweet, but new things confuse her because she doesn't recognise it, so she keeps on putting it in new places, gives it to me or simply throws it out. We told them not to do too much but they refuse to listen and don't follow her routine. We buy her new things that are the same or look very similar to what she already has when it needs replacement. So she recognises it. 

So when they said they want to come for a week once a month we said no, mil also said she doesn't really want it because they push her to do too much because they feel like she has to experience everything before she gets too bad. I understand this but according to her dementia consultants doing too much can also make her decline go faster. 

So, are we the bad guys for not wanting to go along with this? ",4,1759087422.0,AmItheAsshole,14,0.7,False

1nsx2tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1nsx2tt/adventures_in_carb_loading/,Adventures in Carb Loading,"I’ve run many races, including 5 marathons and a 50k, but I’ve never done a “real” carb-loading plan. I want to try it for my fall marathon, but we all know Nothing New on Race Day, so I wanted to practice it first. I had a half marathon yesterday that I was using as a practice race, so I decided to do one day of carb loading to try it out. 



I was shooting for 500-600g of carbs on Friday, the day before the race. This amount was based on my weight and using the calculator at [Featherstone Nutrition](https://www.featherstonenutrition.com/carb-loading/).'s carb loading [guide](https://mcusercontent.com/e0e09087fe1a6308fa946991c/files/c545909b-877e-c205-5dd7-5687108e56dc/Carb_Load_How_To_Guide_Featherstone_Nutrition_MC.pdf). 

Diary from the day:

5:00am- muffin (16) 

5:30am- large bottle of gatorade (51) 

7:15am- Smoothie- 8oz cherry juice, yogurt, banana, sweet potato, blueberries (100)

7:30am- Coffee w/ sugar and creamer (30)

9:00am- bagel/jam (63) 

10:00am- 8oz orange juice (26) and cheerios x2 (60) = 86

11:30am- lunch- Sweet tea (30), rice (45), chips (50), corn tortillas x2 (20) = 145

2:00pm- skittles (30)

5:00pm- Dinner- fried rice (50) and sushi (30) w/ sauce (10) = 90

TOTAL - 611 total grams of carbs (approx)



My experience- It was easy to get the gatorade down after my run; I discovered very early that liquid carbs are where it’s at! My smoothie was a carb bomb and also very easy to get down. It was awhile before I was hungry again though, and my bagel, cheerios, and lunch were a little bit of a struggle. I was definitely ready for a snack though so the skittles were great, and I was hungry by dinner time and ate a ton. I felt super full and a little bloated in the evening, and I was slightly gassy race morning, but I had zero issues with my stomach (nausea or diarrhea) during the race. I did take an immodium the night before just in case. I did eat a bagel and banana a couple hours before the race, a SIS Beta (40g carbs) about 20 minutes before the race and every 30 min during. 



Performance- I felt amazing during the race. Possibly better than I’ve ever felt. My legs were strong, and it was mile 10 before I really felt much fatigue, even at a pace I have not been running in training. I beat my time goal by 5 minutes (I was hoping for a 1:45 and ran a 1:40) and it was my second fastest half time ever. I was only a couple minutes from my PR, and I am not even close to being as trained as I was for that PR race. 



Thoughts- I will absolutely go forward with the carb loading strategy for my full marathon in about a month. I may try a two-day practice for my last 20 miler this weekend. I have upped my carb intake tremendously during this training block, which could have resulted in my breakthrough performance yesterday. But the carb loading also seemed to have helped- it most certainly didn’t hurt. I didn’t feel heavy or have any negative side effects from it during the race. Afterward, I felt extremely strong and I’ve recovered quickly. 



I know 13.1 miles doesn’t necessarily deplete glycogen stores like a full marathon, but I really wanted to test if my body could handle the extra carbs during a hard effort. In the past, I’ve had very serious gut issues near the end of races, but carb increases during training have allowed me to fuel my body properly both before and during a race. I felt absolutely amazing compared to past experiences! I was smiling for most of the race and I felt strong and prepared. (I’m not nearly as well trained as I have been in the past due to building back slowly from injury)



I know some will say carb loading doesn’t help and science doesn’t prove it or whatever, but it definitely won’t hurt anything to try it (during a practice effort, not goal race day!) and see what happens. I’ve never done anything like this, and I was shocked at how well it all went. Obviously this is one anecdotal story and shouldn't be used for medical or coaching advice.

1nsx1vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nsx1vv/tsikuricom_part_2/,Tsikuri.com (Part 2),"Hello again.

It’s been a little while since my last post, and I thought I’d update you all on the website.

I had been meaning to get around to it for a while, but I was getting behind in my studies and I couldn’t let this video feed lead me astray.

First off, I’d like to provide my reasoning for continuing to keep tabs on this website. Even if this website is not a work of unfiction, I believe it is important for someone to document the events that have occurred. I mean, if this is some kind of stalking incident then wouldn’t it be best for evidence to be collected? Hopefully I will be able to provide a complete history of the site through these posts.

Anyway as I mentioned at the end of the last post, the cameras have been following someone new. I’ll start by telling you about the morning of the switch.

At that time, the cameras had been continuing through the same cycle, following the absent man’s usual route. Because of this, I gradually checked on it less and less; the itching feeling I had previously felt between viewings was gradually subsiding into a quiet, but persistent, confusion. After a couple days of not even looking at the website, I got another message.

Him: “check the site”

I tripped over my feet as I made my way to my computer.

I opened up the page but, as the bars of pixels lit up in descending order, changes became immediately apparent.

First, the quality of the video was significantly improved. Not exactly to the quality of a movie, or even an old sitcom, but markedly clearer than the smudge of an image that I had become familiar with. There was now color; hazy shades of tans and whites that distorted into random hues at the ends of fluorescent lights.

Next, instead of the parking lots and alleyways I was accustomed to, there was tile flooring and plaster walls. There were some potted plants, a front desk with a receptionist, and a man looking at some papers. Several other people walked by in dress shirts and sensible heels, off to fax machines and busywork I can only assume.

Lastly, as the man finished whatever he was doing and walked off, the camera switched, now not only displaying a hallway, but also the most important change. The same man was walking, checking his phone as he gradually made his way.

This was the new target.

Me: “How long since it switched to this place?”

Him: “about 15 minutes”

Him: “he was in a parking garage then walked to this building”

The man passed another metal desk, stopping for a moment to search his pockets, then opened the door.

The camera switched again, now revealing a moderately sized, adequately furnished office. He sat down, booted up his computer, and leaned back in his chair. He remained there for the rest of the time that I watched.

\------------------------------

I got back on the website towards the end of his work day after a call from my grandmother. I’ve been trying to reconnect with my grandma since her trip to the hospital. We were really close when I was a kid, but things became complicated as I got older as many things do.

I had also promised myself that if the video started again I would be more discerning with my time. The higher-ups likely wouldn’t be happy with me putting my life on hold to watch a stranger wander around.

He was just finishing his business and got up to leave. As he did, the cameras reversed their order from that morning: the metal desk outside his office, now manned by a dark-haired woman, the hallway, and the front lobby. They then made their way to new scenery - a sidewalk, and a parking garage. He found his car in a parking spot near the entrance, then got in.

As he did, the camera shifted to a view of the inside of his car. This shocked me more than it maybe should have, but given that the previous victim had stayed outdoors the majority of his time, the close view of the man from the shoulders up, turning on his car, was a novel one. This was the clearest image of either of the subjects I had ever seen.

He looked middle-aged, tired, his hair a little out of place. His clothes were nice though; a recently pressed gray suit.

I stared at this man for about 10 minutes, taking in every detail I could; watching his expressions, his gestures, and his subpar driving until the image of a driveway took over the feed.

As he parked and got out of his car, I was *sure* that I would lose sight of the man. He was entering his suburban house, leaving the public square. His home ought to be the most private of places, his own holy space, veiled from the outside world by the curtains on his windows. Tsikuri did not seem to have the same reservations. Not a minute later I was viewing an entryway.

Me: “Wait, we’re in his house now?”

Him: “its just a set dumba\*\*”

His claim, though logical, was hard to fully believe, as the quality of the supposed set was very impressive. It was fully furnished with rather nice, if a little worn, furniture. The trash can was not-quite full of paper towels, boxes and wrappers. The recycling bin next to it was empty. His sink had a few dishes in it, but only a reasonable amount. I told myself that the most simple solution was that it was just the actor’s real house. On the coffee table in his living room was a photo album I would later find him looking at occasionally. Looking back it struck me as odd, as he didn’t seem like a very sentimental person. He had a lot of these kinds of contradictions.

The next few days went by with little to note. His job required a pretty steady routine, as one might expect. His days were uneventful, and his nights even more so; only the mindless shifting of position in his bed, and the occasional trip to the bathroom.

The only substantial change in that time was on the fourth day, when the receptionist outside his office was gone. By the next week though, there was another woman to take her place. This one was a little younger, with blonde hair that neatly fell on either shoulder.

It was around this time that my internet associate added me to a FairSeas group chat. I didn’t know any of the people in it besides him, but they were the only ones I was aware of that were following Tsikuri. I had to discuss it with someone, so I took whatever interaction I could.

I disavow any controversial opinions expressed or inappropriate language used by the people in that chat.

Me: “Do any of you guys know what’s going on?”

“no clue”

“I’ve only been watching for a few days now.”

“You didnt miss much.”

“just a hobo gettin murked”

Me: “What do you think happened to him?”

“who gives a f\*\*\*”

“That was just the preview. This guy’s the real main character I bet”

“as if this lame a\*\* show will have a plot.”

They weren’t much help.

After a few weeks, I became very acquainted with this man’s schedule. On Mondays he would talk to his computer for the first few hours of his shift, his attitude more reserved than at any other time. Tuesdays through Thursdays were indistinguishable, solely consisting of him working at his desk and occasionally meeting with his staff. Fridays usually had meetings in another room in the office building.

I’m trying to stay as neutral as possible while I’m writing this but… I don’t like this new person very much. Whenever an employee comes into his office, his attitude slowly becomes more aggressive. His wild gesticulations and the downturned expression of the workers show a tenuous relationship. The meetings usually lasted a long time as well; the miserable look of his employees doing little to calm his temper. The only person who seems safe from direct hostility is the woman working the desk outside of his office. While she doesn’t receive his unbridled wrath as consistently as the intermittent individuals, she often gets caught in the blast zone. Whenever she would poke her head in to relay some information, she seemed to consistently regret it.

When he’s not yelling at his staff, he spends a lot of time putzing around his room; straightening his desk, cleaning his shelves - I’ve even spotted him taking a nap in his chair a couple times. Another contradiction I suppose.

Outside of work, his hobbies primarily include watching movies on a television I can’t see the screen of, eating out at extravagant restaurants, and driving erratically while yelling at any person in his sight.

I know I have no right to judge him, but I can’t help but resent his behavior.

The members of the group chat don’t seem to have the exact same feelings as I do:

“D\*\*n I wish I had his job”

“I would love to f\*\*\*ing yell at people all day”

“I can’t believe that p\*\*\*\* is crying”

“geez I hope he fires that fat f\*\*\*”

Like before, the group hasn’t provided much new insight on what these videos are for, but another notable conversation happened while the man was walking from his car to a restaurant one night.

“Wait, this kinda looks like a building on my street”

“stop trying to f\*\*\* with us”

“No he’s right, the street sign says r\*\*\*\*d road”

“F\*\*\* you man”

The initial comment once again calls into question the origin of these videos. At the time I still found little reason to believe them to be non-fiction, but with no confirmation of who was putting these videos online the question still nagged at me. Hopefully someone will be able to come up with a new piece of evidence soon, though it seems like we are all equally in the dark.

Whether or not these videos are real, it makes me painfully aware of all of the many cameras that surround me every day. The lens on top of my computer burns my skin like a magnifying glass. It makes me want to stay wrapped in a blanket all day. I’ve spent my whole life in the company of a spectator; I ignored his plastic gaze for a while, but now when I have the chance to peer through these faceless eyes I’m unable to ignore it. I can’t help but think of all the innocuous things I’ve done in the pretend privacy of my room. All the words I’ve ever said. Surely there’s something that could be worthy of reprimanding.

I’ve started changing my clothes as quickly as possible, in the corner of my room farthest from my computer. I would cover the camera, but the thought of potentially bringing attention to myself is a petrifying one.

\------------------------------

One day, he left his office to use the bathroom, and, at the desk outside his office, the first receptionist was there, from the very first couple days. I had almost forgotten about her existence at this point, so her return as an actor in this film was more than enough to catch my attention. She was standing at the desk, seemingly caught mid-conversation with the new woman. The blonde one smiled nervously to the man as he spoke briefly to them. The dark-haired one had frozen in place, then after a moment ducked her head and quickly left. I wished I could follow her out of the room. I doubt that she could be as unbearable as the man I was stuck with. Unfortunately, as she left the frame of the video feed, she departed from my world.

Looking back on the past few weeks, I have pretty substantially fallen short of my goal to not let this silly website take over my life again. I made a valiant effort the first few days, but now it’s practically all I can think about. Why do I care so much about this frustrating man driving back and forth from work, going to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and making everyone around him miserable?

It’s like there’s something hypnotic about the wavering mist of pixels, like blurry raindrops covering the screen. Something in the dark shadows of the room is luring me in, telling me that if I just keep watching I’ll gain the understanding that I seek.

A few days later, the man was pacing around his room, having a notably unproductive day even for him. He would frequently stop by his door, seemingly peeking out at something. After about 30 minutes of this, he opened the door and called to his receptionist. She entered after a minute or so and he sat down at the desk, offering her the seat opposite his.

He spoke to her for a while, seemingly lecturing her, though in a much more reserved manner than usual. Instead of flailing about, his hands were folded on the surface in front of him.

Over time, the woman seemed to grow uncomfortable. She began fidgeting with the collar of her dark button down shirt, her legs pressed tightly together. After a few minutes, he pulled out his cell phone with a stern look on his face, and gestured for her to stand up.

She took a long pause. For a moment her eyes turned, to look at me. Not truly at me of course, but her expression, somewhere between embarrassment and desperation, felt like a condemnation.

She then reluctantly stood up, holding the collar of her shirt closed. A light on his phone flashed. He motioned for her to turn around. She hesitated even longer then slowly turned. Her legs were stiff under her pencil skirt. Another flash.

She turned back around to face him, her face hidden from view. He opened the door for her to leave, smiling and lightly grabbing her elbow as she trudged past him.

Later that day, after eating his microwave dinner in the armchair in his living room, he printed out some items from his home computer. He walked to the coffee table and picked up his photo album. He flipped through page after page, his hands caressing the smooth plastic. He licked his finger despite the glossy texture of the film, and flipped one last page. He took one of the printed items, clear now as a photograph, and impatiently jammed it between the two clear layers. It didn’t penetrate the sleeve on the first try, so he smoothly but forcefully slid it between the clear layers, wriggling it to get it all the way in. He repeated this motion with the other photos, fitting them into place until he was satisfied with the layout.

I despise this man. A lot. I have to keep reminding myself that this is all a facade, and that there was nothing I could do to punish him for his actions. I’m sure that the creators of this narrative will give him what he deserves.

\------------------------------

The next morning I was greeted by a familiar surprise. The car was back. It was across the street from his house as he left for work. It was in the parking garage as he got his things out of his car. It was there as he walked to his office building, in the corner of the video.

As he got to his office, there were two men waiting for him with his receptionist standing off to the side. She looked unwell. The man, clearly caught off guard, greeted them. They spoke to him for about 15 minutes, then left, leaving the man by himself to enter his office. He slowly sat down in his chair, his head in his hands. Then, he abruptly slammed his fists into his desk, jostling the various items lying on top of it. He punched the computer monitor, causing it to fall onto the floor. He flailed, and screamed, and punched his chair until he was out of breath.

By lunchtime, his things were packed up, and he was out of his office.

As he passed his receptionist’s desk she froze, clenching the boxes in her own hands.

He drove home quietly, his face twisted and inscrutable. He sat in his car for a few minutes, unmoving. He eventually got out of his car, then walked up his driveway; his pace tired and slow. After he finally made it to his door, he dropped his keys on the ground. Instead of picking them up, he collapsed, his hands scuffed on the pavement, and his pants got dirtied by the lawn. He looked exhausted; drained of all feeling.

Despite my disdain for this man, it felt cruel to watch him at his lowest point; transgressive even. I almost exited the page. To see any adult reduced to the actions of a child was deeply uncomfortable; let alone a complete stranger, a middle-aged man with some level of authority. Even though his behavior was deplorable, he was still a person. I had seen him too tired to eat breakfast. I had seen him run to the bathroom after he got home from work. I had seen him nervously waiting for a meeting with his superiors. He picked his nose in the car, fell asleep at work

I wondered how long this website would continue to thoroughly and vividly document his breakdown.

My answer came much more quickly than I had expected.

1nswzpe,https://i.redd.it/pr557xzygyrf1.jpeg,"1st brisket. Sorry,  no squish video or black gloves","8lb brisket done on a pellet smoker. 

Rubbed with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, chili powder, cocoa, coffee. Left to sit with the rub on for 14 hours in the fridge. 

6ish hours at 225° to get to 160° had a decent bark formed, so wrapped in foil with several pads of butter and back on for another 3ish hours until probe tender at 200° pulled and rested wrapped in a towel in the oven set to keep warm for 2 hours. Pretty happy with taste and tenderness.

Don’t think I’d do the butter in the foil again, it loosened the bark on the bottom too much.

Any feedback is appreciated, definitely a noob here. 

And thanks to everyone who chimed in on my question about resting yesterday, none of you agreed, but it let me accept that there’s a million and one ways to rest a brisket.

He was the plant manager and then became general manager. I only saw him once closely, face to face I mean, when he was buying coffee. He was tall, slim, wore a button down shirt and had some super blue eyes that also looked very intelligent. He was strict and could be very mean. People respected him and avoided at the same time. He was the leader of like 600 people. He was confident and had a manly aura and so tough. Old school engineer.

It was only a few years later when we interacted for the very first time and only time. During a call he made me feel very bad about myself and raised his voice at me. It was not even my mistake, but my colleague. He had no idea who I am or who my colleague is but he was angry and talked down to me, asking stuff like: are you competent enough to at least follow what I say? Can you understand what I wrote in that note? I cried after the meet and reported him.

I resigned (due to other reasons) and now, some years later, I am 30, he is 46. We met at a local event. Friday night. I knew who he is but he did not. But when I told him my name he remembered me and said something like: you that girl that reported me (he was friendly though). He said he shouldn't have talked to me like that but managerial positions are very tough and sometimes he loses his temper but he actually respected me for standing up for myself in front of him. He said he tries to keep his temper under control. We then went for some drinks and his eyes were on my chest. I noticed it. He was starring. Just very discreetly from time to time as it was pretty deep and V shaped (nature has been generous with me in the size of that area). And we ended up at his place and it was great.

I did not spend the night but the next day, without giving any details I asked a woman who still works there if he has changed a bit, and she said he got even worse with his temper. Anyway, he did not ask for any contact details. Should I follow him on linked in at least? I mean I forgot about him during these years but now...

He is also divorced and has been for like 8 years already.",0,1759087094.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.33,False

Her mother had died from an illness, her father, the Alpha, resented her. Out of desperation, He married another female who had twin sons of her own. She was cruel to Lizzy.   However, only one thing kept her surviving, a black obsidian necklace that was given to her by a boy she met at her mother's funeral. Xander Nightwalker. They may have only been children and they may have only had a moment, but they knew in an instant, they had something special together. They had promised each other that they would meet once again. But it never happened...until one night.  Xander Nightwalker was a dangerous Alpha. He was the leader of the most powerful pack in the world...Blood Moon Pack. He had a very complicated past.

When he is reunited with his Elizabeth...Xander's dark past catches up with him ready to consume both him and Izzy. But he would move heaven and earth to protect the one light in his world of darkness.

 Chapter 1

 I stand beside my mother's coffin, looking at her face. She was gorgeous. She had pale and fair skin, sandy brown hair, bright green eyes that always reminded me of the forest and her warm smile. I think that's what I'm going to miss the most, her smile.

 I look at my father, Alpha Nikolai Crow, on the other side of the coffin. His deep brown hair, so similar to mine, was rare in its wild unkemptness, lacking the vigor of former days. His hand is holding my mother's cheek and his other hand holding her's. His sobs rake through his body, his tears are falling on my mother's cold cheek.

 My mother died from a sickness. She was human, so her body couldn't heal itself.

 I didn't realise I was crying until I felt my cold and wet tears run down my cheeks.

 They say that our mother will go to another place where there is no pain. Where could that be? I cannot imagine such a place. People look at me with pity, and I am perplexed as to where their pity comes from - did not my mother depart for a better place?

 But the connection my wolf had with my mother is dissolving into nothing. The connection is getting pulled from me by force. It is making me feel so empty, so empty, so empty. I need air, I need to leave. I turn to the forest and run. I run through the green trees, I feel as if my mother's presence is here.

 My tears leak onto the side of my face as I sob and run. My legs are burning, but I don't care, I keep running. I need to forget.

 I've been running for an hour, until I stop at a clearing. There lyes a beautiful waterfall. There's clear water, with green bushes, and red, blue, purple, yellow and pink wild flowers, but not flowers I've seen before. These look exotic. They have exquisite swirl designs. I've never seen such a beautiful place before. I thought places like theses only exist in dreams.

 I kneel beside the water and let my hand flow through it. Tears fill my eyes to the brim, I close my eyes, letting the tears run their own waterfall. I inhale a deep breathe only to exhale a grieving sob.

 I can’t feel my mama’s connection.

 A strong hand touches my shoulder. I get such a big fright that I almost fall into the water, but the hands grab my waist, ""Be careful!"" It's a boy. I look up only to see dark brown eyes. So dark, they look black.

 ""W-who're you?"" I hesitantly ask.

 ""I'm Xander, son of Alpha Nightwalker. We came to your mother's funeral.""

 I nod understandingly. ""Why are you here?"" I asked softly.

 ""I saw you run into the woods. I didn't want you to be alone, so I followed.""

 I walk towards a thick tree trunk and sit, ""I want to be alone."" I sighed.

 ""Everyone says that, but they always don't mean it.""

 ""That's true.""

 Xander walked over to me and sits down. ""What's your name?"" He asks.

 ""Izzy.""

 He smiles. His smiles was beautiful. It instantly transforms his face. ""That's really pretty. I'm 10 years old. How older are you?""

 ""7.""

 Xander nods and looks at the glistening water. As the wind makes ripples, the water shines and flickers with light.

 ""You're going to be okay Izzy.""

 ""Yeah, I guess. I just wish I wasn't sad anymore.""

 ""Well, I'll be there so than you won't be sad anymore.""

 We grew silent for a while, listening to the sound of water crashing against the ground. And then I heard him ask, ""How is that feel? When your mom...I mean...”

 I immediately learned what he wanted to ask.

 “It’s like a hole on my chest.” I murmured, “So empty. Especially when our connections been cut, I felt crushed.”

 “I’m sorry.” He sighed.

 “Do you know what is death?” I asked, “They said my mom went to a better place. But she cut our connection. I mean, if that place was really nice, she would link me and tell me how good there was, right?”

 “Maybe she will link me when she got there.” I answered myself firmly, “Maybe she was just in a traffic jam.”

 After furrowing his brow in thought for a moment, he affirmed my statement, ""Undoubtedly, it must be due to traffic jam. You see, that place is so desirable, surely many people must be heading there.”

 “But I’m still sad. I really miss her.” I tried my best to surpass my tear.

 He pulls a leather string from his neck and lifts it over his head. It's a necklace. It had obsidian stone hanging.

 ""My mother made this for me. I haven't taken it off once. Not even in the shower. I want to give it to you.""

 ""No! I can't let you! Your mommy gave it to you. You have to keep it.""

 ""I was happy when I got this necklace. Maybe my necklace saved some of my happiness. If I give it to you, it might help with your sadness."" Xander put the necklace on me and adjusted it a little. I touch it. It's still warm from resting on Xander's chest. He gave me his precious necklace, just so than I won't be saddened anymore. My heart filled with warmth.

 We sat under the tree for hours, talking about everything and anything. We started out by naming the waterfall. It was our special place and as our special place, it needed a name. So we decided on calling it Nightcrowe Waterfall. The first part of his last and my last name. But he never knew it was my last name. I never told him.

 ""Do you know what mates are?"" Xander asks.

 ""I think so. It's like what my mum and dad are right?""

 ""Yeah, I hope we will be mates. I really like you.""

 ""When can we tell?""

 ""We have to be 18.""

 ""Thats a long time.""

 ""Yeah, but what if we fall in love with other people before that?"" Xander looked angry, a growl came from his chest. It gave me a little spike of fear. He wouldn't let his wolf hurt me, would he? Xander looks at me and his eyes softened, ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just don't really like the thought of you with another boy.""

 ""Well, if it makes you feel any better, I don't like the thought of you with another girl.""

 Xander turned his whole body to face and crossed his legs together, ""We have to promise each other we won't fall in love with anyone else.""

 I smile, ""I promise Xander, that I won't fall in love with another boy, but you.""

 He laughed with joy and excitement, ""I promise Izzy, that I won't fall in love with another girl, only you.""

 Xander slowly moves his hand to mine. He looks away when his cheeks start to blush. I lean over and kiss his cheek. His eyes widen with shocked. And then they close as he starts to lean to me. I've never been kissed before. What if I'm bad at it? Before I could refuse, Xander puckered his lips and pressed them firmly onto mine. Warmth travel upto my cheeks.

 Once we separated, Xander has a big smile in his face, ""There...we sealed our promise with our first kiss.""

 ""That was your first kiss?""

 ""Yeah, was that yours?""

 ""Yes....was I bad at it?""

 He giggled, ""No. You were really good.""

 I look at Xander's handsome face. I can see myself as his mate in the future.

 Xander and I walk back to the pack hand in hand.

 ""Xander, it's time to go son,"" Alpha Nightwalker says. Him and his father climb into the car and drive away. I see Xander's head pop out of the window. He had a big smile on his face and waved good-bye, ""Remember our promise Izzy! Remember!""

 From that day on, I never saw Xander or Nightcrowe Waterfall ever again.

 Chapter 2

 As I matured and looked back on the memory of my mother’s funeral, I realized that in my youth I was too ignorant to comprehend the gravity of death. I was too young to understand my father’s losing mate would bring me to what kind of situation.

 Years later, the situation finally hit me.

 ""Lizzy! Where's the breakfast?!"" My stepmother, Caroline, shouted from downstairs. My father must have already left for his week-long trip for alpha business. If he was still here, Caroline wouldn't be shouting and demanding as she is now.

 I snuggle into my warm blanket and pillow. 5 more minutes wouldn't hurt. But, I just end up falling asleep. I then get woken up with a rush of cold tingles. Then I realized someone has just poured a bucket of ice-cold water on me....in bed. I lung out of bed shivering. I look up, only to see my evil step-brother, Vince.

 He looks at me and smirks, ""Hurry up and get dressed. My mother wants her breakfast."" He leaves me standing in the middle of my room, drenched in ice cold water, in my winter cold room. Caroline won't let me have a heater in my room. So, I made my self a thick blanket by sowing two together. My other older brother, who is the twin of Vince, walked passed my room, only to back up and face me. He looks sad when he takes in my appearance.

 ""Vince?"" He says in a hard voice. Eddie has never really liked his older brother. Well, Vince is older by 10 minutes. Eddie has always been my protector against Caroline and Vince. My father remarried a female wolf who had twin boys of her own from her now dead mate.

 Eddie quickly grabs a towel and walks towards me, wrapping the warm material around me. He walks to his shower and turns on the water. Caroline has shut off the hot water in my shower. She says it's to save money apparently which makes no sense because both of her sons have their own bathrooms and hot water. I doubt it would be more expensive if I had a little bit of hot water to. I don't even know how she did it, but she did. Eddie usually lets me use his.

 After my shower I dressed in my thick, black winter jeans, a thick black and grey sweater and a black infinity scarf, then I put my hair up in a messy bun.

 I make my way downstairs and into the kitchen. I start to make bacon, eggs, and chocolate chip pancakes. I learned to cook at 8 years old when Caroline first came here. I'm 19 now. So I've got some pretty good skills in the kitchen, not meaning to brag or anything.

 I set the meal and her cup of black coffee with no sugar, in front of Caroline. She sits straight like how a proper lady should. She sniffs the food, takes a little bite out of everything. Then she picks up her plate calmly, turns to me and dumps her food onto my freshly washed head. I stay still. I know if I let all my anger out right, I'll regret it. All I do is silently hold back my emotions.

 ""You didn't put enough butter or milk into my eggs. Make me something better for lunch dearest,"" she turns to walk away, but looks over her shoulder and looks at me with a cruel smirk, ""Oh and do clean up your mess dear, and while you're at it, clean yourself up, you look and smell disgusting.""

 I scowl at her, ""If you hate how I cook then why don't you cook yourself?""

 She stills and glares down at me, ""Because I am the Luna. I have responsibilities and duties to do in order to run this pack while my mate is gone which includes taking care of you. The least you could do is make me food.""

 My step-brother walks in and glares at his mother as soon as he saw me standing in food, ""The least you could do is treat her like she's your equal mother."" Eddie says firmly to her.

 She turns to Eddie and her eyes brighten, ""Oh sweetheart. You look absolutely gorgeous this morning,"" she says with a cheerful smile, completely ignoring what Eddie said. All Eddie does is sneer at his mother, ""Why do you do this? What has Lizzy ever done to you?"" He says firmly. Caroline's perfectly composed face turns into a look that could kill, ""You have overstepped the line son. You have no idea what that worthless piece of shi-""

 ""If she's so worthless why is she worth any of your time? You put quite a lot of your time and effort into making sure she's miserable.""

 ""I treat her according to how she behaves. She is a spoilt brat, she needs to learn what hard work is."" She growls at Eddie.

 My brother shakes his head, disagreeing with her, ""You should remember your place mother.""

 ""And you should remember yours son."" She growls.

 Eddie looks down at his mother, ""You were born from Omega parents, mother. Elizabeth was born from an Alpha. She was born to be a Luna, you just married into the role. So as I said before, you should treat her like an equal.""

 All Caroline does is growl and stomp out of the house. Eddie makes his way over to me, bends down to his knees to help me clean up silently. ""Thank you,"" I mumbled.

 Eddie let's out a loud sigh, ""Lizzy, you have to stand up for yourself. You can't let my beast of a mother trample all over you like that."" He says softly.

 ""I try to sometimes. But whenever I do she complains to dad and then he comes storming into my room, giving me lectures about how I need to change and be more submissive and respectful.""

 Eddie shakes his head, ""I don't get your dad. I don't understand how he can treat his daughter like that.""

 I sat down and leaned against the wall, ""Me neither. Ever since my mother died, he was never the same. He never treated me the same. It's almost like he pretended I wasn't his daughter.""

 ""Maybe he did that because you reminded him of his mate.""

 I shrug, ""Yeah probably. I guess maybe it was easier for him to cope if he pretended that I wasn't his daughter.""

 ""That's pretty fucked up."" Eddie said.

 I smirk, ""I know. I feel like a stranger in my own home."" I look down at my hands and found them gripping my pants tightly, ""But at the same time, I'm always trying to not be angry at him, to not feel rejected because I don't want to become this angry, bitter or cold person. But he makes it so hard.""

 Eddie's eyes soften as he stares at me. He shuffles next to me and gathers me in his arms, ""You could never be cold Lizzy. You're too sweet for your own good."" I release a little laugh. Eddie always knew how to make laugh when I'm all sad and glum, ""After I clean myself up I'll bake you some cookies."" When I turn around to go to Eddie's shower, I feel him do the little silent ""YUSSS"" and fist in the air thing. I laugh silently to myself.

 Chapter 3

 As I was baking the cookies I felt my mood decline. I think talking about my dad was more painful than I thought. He was the only father-figure in my life and he doesn't want me, at least that's how he acts.

 My step-mother hates me, my step-brother Vince has made his goal to make me miserable also. The only other person that treats me well is Eddie.

 I think of my real mother. As I mix the cookie dough I close my eyes and remember my mother showing me how to make cookies. The sound of her laugh when she would find me eating off the spoon. Her warm, kind, brown eyes pouring love and comfort into my soul. I thought she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.

 My body rakes with sobs as I remember how much she loved me and how much I loved her. She was my best friend. But she's gone. Now she only exists in my memories. I haven't thought of her in a long while. It's too painful sometimes. Other times, when I desperately need comfort, I would imagine myself as that five year old again and how my mother would hold me as I would cry. Singing to me and telling me stories.

 Now my own father doesn't really want me. I'm only a reminder of what he lost. Which I understand. I understand how it would've been so hard for him to lose his mate, but that still doesn't justify what he does. He abandoned me when I needed him the most. Especially after he married that witch of a woman and he never defended me whenever she mistreated me.

 I cried as I felt this loneliness seep into my chest. This black and hallow room that sat inside of me, wanting to be filled with the love and comfort of a mother she lost and the love of a father that he refuses to give.

 I shake my head, ""Get a hold of yourself, Izzy."" I said to myself. I took a deep breath.

 ""You're strong, Elizabeth,"" Says my mother in my head.

 I nodded my head, ""I'm strong.""

 ""You're capable of getting through this and growing into the person you are destined to be."" She said in a soft voice.

 I nodded my head in agreement.

 ""I love you, Elizabeth."" She said.

 I sob, ""I love you, mother.""

 I took a deep breath. I know I can be a push-over sometimes. And sometimes I don't stand up for myself. But what matters is that it's possible for me to do it. If it's possible then I can do it.

 ***

 Eddie moans as the cookie melts in his mouth, ""Ohhhh this is so good Lizzy. You seriously have a gift.""

 I laugh, ""Tell me something I don't know,"" I joke. I grab a small plate of cookies and walk up the stairs to Vince's room. I knock on his door softly. ""What'd you want?"" He shouts.

 I open the door and walk in, ""Do you want some cookies. I just made them."" Vince grabs the whole plate, puts it beside him on his messy bed. ""Why're you still here?"" He says annoyingly, as if I was the problem, ""Go,"" he snarls. When he turns back around I roll my eyes as I left.

 Why does Vince treat me this way? Why does Caroline? What have I ever done to them that earned their hatred towards me? They treat me differently, they look at me differently, they make me feel like an alien in my own house. I should feel at home. But this hasn't been my home ever since they came years ago. Eddie was the only comfort I had now.

 ""Why would you offer some to Vince?"" Eddie said a little annoyed.

 I sighed, ""Because, I sometimes try to be the bigger person.""

 After I wash the dishes, I take a walk in the forest. I do this now and again to try to feel connected to my mother. I still feel an empty part of my heart. Probably an after effect of her death.

 As I walk through the thick trees, my thoughts wander to a waterfall. But not just any waterfall, my Nightcrowe waterfall. That was the place I met the one boy who I fell in love with. I still have his necklace. I haven't taken it off once in 12 years. The leather string is now tattered and old. I take comfort in the thought that this necklace used be around the neck of my boy, Xander and now it's touching my neck. It makes me feel like we have a bond.

 That's right, not had, have. I can tell the bond we had back then is still there to this day. Maybe Xander was right. Maybe his necklace really did help me. Or maybe it wasn't the necklace at all, maybe it was truly his 'act' of giving me his necklace that moved my heart. The fact that his mother gave it to him and him giving it to me. Yeah, I think that's it.

 The wind blew through the forest, emitting a lamenting cry. Then everything grew into silence.

 Until I heard a light crack burst out.

1nswq5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nswq5m/explore_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_by/,Explore if the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker by Amazon Basics Delivers,"Testing the Amazon Basics AB-1178B coffee maker has been a delightful experience in many ways, but there are also some considerations worth pointing out. This single-serve coffee maker has been my companion for the past few weeks, with its sleek black and stainless steel design looking sharp on my otherwise cluttered kitchen counter. Compact yet functional, it manages to pack a number of useful features into its unassuming frame.

**Sleek and Space-Saving Design**  
This coffee maker’s small footprint is one of its most appealing traits. Measuring 5.98”D x 9.44”W x 14.17”H, it fits neatly into tight spaces, making it ideal for an apartment kitchen, a break room, or even a dorm room. Personally, I appreciated how it didn’t take over the limited counter space in my kitchen. It’s both practical and stylishly minimal, seamlessly blending into the surroundings.

**Versatile Brewing Options**  
As someone who likes to alternate between freshly ground coffee and convenient pods, I found this coffee maker's dual brewing system incredibly convenient. The ability to use both K-Cup coffee capsules and traditional coffee grounds gave me flexibility on busy mornings or when I felt like indulging in a freshly brewed cup of my favorite roast. Although the machine leans more toward simplicity, it does a stellar job with both brewing methods.

**Easy Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Cleaning up is usually the least enjoyable part of making coffee, but the removable drip tray and 24-ounce refillable water reservoir made life so much easier. I discovered that the tray is quick to remove and rinse, which is helpful for those moments when you’re running late and don’t want to leave your kitchen looking like a mess. The 24-ounce reservoir holds enough water for multiple brews, so you won’t have to refill constantly, saving time during your morning rush.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact, sleek design fits tight spaces seamlessly  
- Offers flexibility with dual brewing options (K-Cups or fresh grounds)  
- Easy-to-clean drip tray and sizable water reservoir  
- Accommodates various cup sizes from 6 to 14 ounces for different servings

**Performance and Safety Features**  
One of the biggest bonus features for me was the auto-shutoff function. As someone with a tendency to forget whether I’ve left an appliance running, this safety feature really saved my peace of mind. Once the brewing process is complete, the machine turns itself off, offering energy efficiency and a welcome sense of reliability. However, I did notice that the brewing speed could vary slightly depending on the quantity of water being used, but it wasn’t enough to be a real issue.

**Good Points**  
- Built-in auto-shutoff feature for safety and energy saving  
- Fast brewing for those busy mornings  
- Great for personal use with straightforward functions  

**Hurdles**  
- Brewing can be noisy, especially in a quiet household  
- Might not be suitable for larger households or multi-cup servings  
- Lacks advanced coffee customization options like temperature control  

**Other Options**  
While testing, I also explored other single-serve coffee makers like the Keurig K-Mini, which shares a similar compact form. The Keurig has more color options and feels slightly more premium but comes at a noticeably higher price point. On the flip side, the Amazon Basics coffee maker edges out in terms of user-friendliness and affordability. Compared to the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which offers a similar dual brewing system, this model’s simplicity may appeal more to those looking for minimal instruction and hassle-free operation.

**Price Performance**  
This machine delivers solid value for its cost. It’s a minimalist coffee maker that provides exactly what you’d need without venturing into premium territory. If you’re looking for over-the-top features or advanced brewing controls, this may not be what you’re after. However, for straightforward coffee-making needs, it’s a reliable and budget-friendly option.

1nswo4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1nswo4s/explore_if_lysol_disinfectant_wipes_truly_beat/,Explore If Lysol Disinfectant Wipes Truly Beat Everyday Germs,"Testing new cleaning products has become an obsession of mine, and using the Lysol 192008934701 wipes felt like diving into a chore superhero's toolkit. As someone who regularly battles the forces of dirt, bacteria, and mysterious sticky surfaces (thanks to kids and pets), I had high hopes for these antibacterial wipes. Spoiler alert: they didn’t let me down. But, like every hero, they come with quirks.  

**Trash Dirt and Germs Like a Boss**  
These wipes claim to eliminate 99.9% of viruses and bacteria, and honestly, I believe them. They promise to even tackle bigger enemies like the COVID-19 virus within 15 seconds. While I’m no scientist, it’s pretty reassuring to know they’re backed by EPA registration (#777-114) and intense testing. I used them on kitchen counters, bathroom sinks, doorknobs, and even my dog-chewed remote control. They were relentless in wiping away everything from greasy marks to the aftermath of a cereal spill gone rogue.  

**Durable Yet Gentle on Surfaces**  
One of the things that stood out was their toughness. They’re touted as being three times stronger than paper towels, and honestly, nobody thought about comparing them until now. Scrubbing baked-on gunk from the stovetop felt oddly satisfying without the wipe tearing into confetti like some lesser brands. Despite their strength, they didn’t leave behind scratches or annoying lint on my glass coffee table or shiny tablet screen. Whether it’s a delicate surface or hardcore mess, they seem adaptable to both.  

[Check Lysol 192008934701 price on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b00gruk048/)

**Scent That Doesn’t Overstay Its Welcome**  
Cleaning your home often comes with its VERY distinctive smells. The Early Morning Breeze scent was a pleasant departure from the overpowering “chemicals with a side of citrus” I’ve experienced in the past. Light and fresh, it genuinely felt like my home was being invited to embrace a spa day instead of suffocating in sterilization fumes. My partner (the sensitive nose of the house) even commented it didn’t bother his allergies—a surprising win.  

**Easy Access, Relatively Thoughtful Packaging**  
The pack of six with 80 wipes each is excellent for stockpiling. Having these conveniently placed under the sink in both the bathroom and kitchen made life infinitely easier. However, the packaging does that thing where after pulling three perfectly separated wipes, you accidentally rip out six at once. It’s a small annoyance, but something to be mindful of when you’re in a cleaning groove.  

**Pluses**  
- Kills 99.9% of bacteria and viruses effectively, including SARS-CoV-2.  
- Durable enough to handle tough messes without tearing.  
- Convenient for tackling multiple surfaces, including electronics.  
- Refreshing scent that doesn’t overpower your spaces.  

**Weaknesses**  
- Packaging mechanism sometimes dispenses too many wipes at once.   
- Slightly over-engineered dimensionally, making the tub bulky for smaller spaces.  

**Challengers**  
Comparing these wipes to other brands like Clorox or store-brand disinfecting wipes, there are noticeable differences—both good and bad. Clorox wipes, for example, share a similar disinfecting power but can be harsher on sensitive electronic screens. Meanwhile, store-brand options tend to lose out miserably in the strength department; they may be cheaper, yet you end up needing twice as many to clean the same area. If durability and surface versatility are your priorities, these Lysol wipes pull ahead. That said, folks who prefer a simpler unscented option might lean toward an alternative.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Now, these aren’t the cheapest wipes on the market, but are they worth their price? Absolutely. When you do the math on wasted wipes with other brands or the trust factor these bring to killing bacteria, they genuinely pull their weight. Spending slightly more for that peace of mind (and fewer wipe malfunctions) feels logical to me. For those who run an entire household circus like I do, getting a six-pack minimizes the hassle of constant reordering.

1nswmmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1nswmmi/explore_howard_restorafinish_for_wood_polish/,Explore Howard Restor-A-Finish for Wood Polish Results That Last,"Wood furniture holds a special place in my heart. It's not just about aesthetics; it's about the stories and memories tied to each scratch, stain, or faded patch. When I got the chance to try out Howard Products RF4016 Restor-A-Finish, I dove in with anticipation. I’ve worked with all kinds of polishes, oils, and conditioners before, but having a product that claimed to blend out scratches and restore luster without stripping the finish? That was intriguing.

**Ease of Application**  
Using this product felt almost too simple. You follow a wipe-on, wipe-off process without the need for sanding or heavy prep—it honestly takes a lot of the intimidation factor out of restoring wood furniture. I’ve tested it on everything from antique cabinet doors to my friend’s scuffed-up coffee table, and in every case, the process was smooth and quick. For example, one pass with a cloth removed white heat rings from a dining table like they were magic. No residue, no mess—just a clean, polished result.

[View Howard Products RF4016 pricing on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b000lnsim8/)

**Great Results Across Multiple Types of Damage**  
I found its effects on sun-faded finishes particularly impressive. I tested it on an outdoor wooden rocker that had been left in the sun for ages. The color came back to life in such a natural way. Plus, it did wonders on scratches and small blemishes on walnut-stained furniture. Scratches that had seemed permanent disappeared right before my eyes. Watermarks and oxidation didn’t stand a chance, either, though deeper gouges and cracks were less impacted.

**Perks**  
- Blends scratches and blemishes seamlessly  
- Excellent for watermarks, oxidation, and minor imperfections  
- Easy wipe-on, wipe-off process saves time and effort  
- Comes in various colors to match most wood tones  
- Doesn’t strip or alter the original finish

**Areas of Concern**  
- This isn't a miracle worker for deep dents or major structural damages  
- While the wipe-on, wipe-off approach is convenient, the smell is strong—ventilate your space  
- Some finishes, particularly on highly treated woods, may not respond as effectively  

**Scent and Safety**  
One thing I couldn't ignore was the chemical smell. It's potent—like most wood refinishing products—and reminded me of a tiny workshop full of varnish fumes. If you’re using this indoors, cracking a window or setting up a fan is non-negotiable. I also wore gloves for safety, as directed on the label, which is always a good rule when working with strong formulas.

**Material Compatibility**  
I love that it’s suited for practically every medium brown tone. The variety of available colors (nine overall!) gives you flexibility. Whether it's dark walnut or cherry, you can find a match, with little risk of uneven tones or color mismatches after application. That said, trying it out on a hidden area first is smart—it’s always better to be safe.

**Product Comparisons**  
Other furniture restoration products I've tried often fall into extremes. Some are superficial surface treatments, leaving wood glossy without addressing deeper flaws. Others can be overly harsh, stripping finishes entirely. Restor-A-Finish falls in a sweet middle ground. Compared to pieces like Danish oil or basic wax polish, this crafts a polished appearance and minimizes many blemishes without buildup. Of course, if you’re tackling severe cracks, wood fillers or sanding kits may still be necessary. Something like Minwax or Old English might slightly rival its restoration powers; however, they lack the finish-preserving quality I love about this.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Looking at comparable options, this delivers layered functionality: color restoration, blemish blending, and finish protection in one bottle. While it might seem pricier than a basic polish or varnish, the results make it feel like a steal. Considering I didn’t need additional tools or professional restoration help, that upfront investment saved me both time and money.

After the whole incident with Gloria and the thing in the dark, Randall gave me a week off. 

There was the physical trauma of it all (i.e. apparently you need stitches when someone literally bites a chunk from your neck?), but also just the mental exhaustion. I’d spent two weeks barely sleeping, driving 16+ hour days, slowly devolving into an anxious, self-loathing wreck. On top of that, I was now dealing with the knowledge that me and every one of my co-workers would one day be offered up as kindling for the fire that was ‘protecting humanity.’ *Oh, and by the way, you can’t tell them.* A week off sounded amazing.

Until it wasn’t.

It’s funny. We complain about work and errands and all the little things that add up to a stressful existence, but when they’re gone? We get bored so quickly.

Maybe that’s just me. I had no family or friends in California. I rarely watched TV. All my hobbies had disappeared years ago, along with my childhood belief that being a fully functioning adult was an achievable goal. It was on day four, around the umpteenth time I was considering calling my ex, Myra―because that’s what you do when you’re bored and spiraling―that I called Randall instead.

“You sure you’re ready to come back?” he asked.

“Nope.” I sighed. “But I’m coming anyway.”

“Did you at least use your time to finish the employee handbook?”

“Uh… sure.”

*Whoops.*

\*\*\*

Over the next week, Randall and I settled into a tentative sort of…*truce,* shall we say?

We didn’t stop hating each other. I didn’t stop glaring at him when I would turn in my keys, and he continued to assign me to rigs with broken internal AC units. He did stop being so much of a jerk, though. In turn, I made no more violent threats. 

*Relationship goals.*

It was a clear sign of how desperately management needed me that there was no retaliation for my confrontation. I’d literally assaulted my manager, broken his nose, and confirmed multiple times, point blank, that *I had no regrets―*and nothing. No punishment. No suspension. Not so much as a warning.

…Though I never did get that second raise I was offered. Guess you can’t trust what people promise you at knifepoint. 

For my first week back, management assigned me only short hauls. *Safe hauls,* if you will. They were usually saved for veteran employees with higher risk of lane-locking. 

It was like they were apologizing. Or maybe that they were afraid I’d fall apart if they let me stay on Route 333 for too long at once. Really, I was only falling apart when I *wasn’t* on it.

The most surprising result from the recent series of events, though, was how Randall actually began answering my questions. We’d talk over the radio as I drove.

“Who’s finding these impossibilities?” I asked one time. “Like hunting and caging them?”

“A few different organizations. Some private. Some government. They all know to reach out to companies like us, but I don’t actually know much about them. We only get involved when the impossibilities are contained.”

“So there’s other roads like Route 333?”

“A few. Not many.”

Another time, on an especially empty part of the desert, we talked nearly half an hour without breaking into screaming―our personal record.

“How come I could drive at normal speed with that crying thing in my trailer?” I asked. “If it’s lane-locked now, shouldn’t it have slowed me down too?”

“The road views things differently when they’re treated as cargo. Lane-locking only applies to the transporter.” Before I could respond, he continued. “*Don’t* ask about doing the same with humans. I know you’re about to. It wouldn’t work.”

“Why not? Has anybody actually *tried* putting humans in the back?”

“Here’s a tip to save both of us some time: assume some trucker before you has attempted any solution you can think up. However you carried Tiff, you’d go as slow as her. Trailer or front seat―it doesn’t matter where she’s sitting. She’d be a passenger not cargo. The road *knows* the difference.”

“How though?”

“Dunno. It can sniff intention, maybe? It knows that her and you are both the same species?”

“There has to be something truckers haven’t tried yet.”

“Nothing obvious.”

“And what happens if we do tell them before they lane-lock?” I asked. “What if we told Chris?”

“Have you ever heard of a driver named Douglas? He was marked for lane-locking, what was it, five years ago now? He noticed the signs before it happened, the ones we do tell you about. He quit. A week later a brand new driver, younger than you, lane-locked out of nowhere. She was the trade.”

“Was her name Autumn?”

A long pause.

“It was,” Randall said. With my short hauls, I still hadn't been able to visit her. “Look, let’s continue this tonight. We’ve been talking too long. There’s always a chance others are listening in.”

“Don’t they deserve to?”

In the distance, a dust devil rose up on the desert floor. Tumbleweeds bounced across the road.

“Really,” I pushed. “Maybe not everything. We don’t have to tell them about lane-locking for now, but they don’t even understand about impossibilities. Most of this is harmless. Why can't we tell them the basics?”

“You're free to.”

“I will.” 

“Will you?”

*Yes,* I nearly snapped back. *Of course.*

In my mind, I imagined it. Approaching the others in the break room and explaining what we were really doing on the road, about impossibilities and the things in the forest and why we should always carry a flashlight near dispatch.

I imagined the questions that would come after. 

More information always bred more questions. It had for me. It wouldn’t be long before they stumbled on the *right* questions, but didn’t they have a right to know? 

They would leave. Who wouldn’t? They’d leave, and another person would be marked by the road in their place. Something terrible would happen. Route 333 would retaliate.

It was the dilemma Randall and the others at dispatch had dealt with for years. I wanted to be better than them. I was actively trying to figure out a solution, but for the time being there was none. Did I let things be for now? Did I tell everyone, no matter the consequences?

“Maybe,” I told Randall.

When I made it back that night, I hesitated before I handed him my keys. “Send me on something longer.”

“Why?”

“Just do it.”

He did.

I went to visit Autumn.

The town she’d stayed in was much the same as I remembered from three weeks previous. A bustling farmer’s market was in full-swing at a nearby park. Vendors and fruit stands filled the grassy area, and parents clutched to the hands of their squirming children. Main Street featured instrument shops and stores lined with vintage records.

The first place I checked for Autumn was the motel―no use. The room she’d stayed in before was now vacant.

“Is there anywhere else to stay around here?” I asked a maid wheeling past me with a cart.

She wasn’t at the second motel either. I tried the rest stop where we’d showered after that, and even took a turn wandering through the farmer’s market. It was eerie watching families interact, knowing they weren’t quite real. Did they know? Were they aware they’d been wandering this same outside market for months? That their children never aged?

I’d arrived to Autumn’s town in the morning. By noon, I was preparing to head out. I did *still* have a job to do, and there were only so many places I could check. Besides, I’d pass back through on the way home.

I was just exiting the doors of *Café Linda* after a brief pit stop when I heard it. A scream. I tossed my cup to the ground (not a big deal. The coffee was yet again terrible) and rushed the direction of the noise.

It came again. 

“Autumn!” I shouted.

 I skittered to a stop at the edge of an alleyway. The scream. The noise. It had come from beyond.

*A trick*. I knew this. Already, one of these things had impersonated Myra and another, Randall. One was merely doing it again. I’d be a fool if I really believed this was Autumn, however terrified the voice seemed. It was effective. Even knowing what I did, I was tempted to go down the alley. I *needed* to know if it was the real her.

A third shriek.

“Autumn!” It escaped my lips involuntarily.

“Stay back!” she shouted. “Don’t come!”

It was all the encouragement I needed to hurl myself down the side street toward her.

But first.

Before we get into all that pesky, exciting action, let’s do something I’m *sure* you all love. 

Let’s pause.

She didn’t explain this all to me until much later that day, but before we proceed, there's some things you should know about Autumn. 



**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**



She did try college. Really, she did. The structure of it all just wasn’t for her. She tried hair school next (big mistake), then electrician work, then eventually, when she’d begun and dropped out of training for half a dozen different trades, she responded to an online advert for a nearby trucking company. It was more out of curiosity than anything. Surely, they couldn’t *actually* pay as much as they purported to.

They did.

Finally, she’d found something she didn’t loathe, that didn’t confine her mind to a monotonous box of monotonous details―what bleach to use on what shade of hair, what wire connected where. In fact, it didn’t confine her mind at all. That was the beauty of it. She could drive, in a trance, and she could think about the things she *wanted* to think about. Autumn wasn’t dumb; she learned quickly. The problem was merely trying to focus on things other people told her to focus on. 

For one year, she hauled on Route 333. Logically, she could drive it for another decade, maybe two. She was new. The road was still short to her. Others were driving on versions of Route 333 four times the length as hers, and they would still drive for years more. She went on the longer hauls that management assigned her to. Shorter hauls were for veteran truckers, not her. She didn’t need to worry. Not yet.

Then she lane-locked. 

It came suddenly. Without the usual warning signs. She’d been coming back from a longer haul at the time, further out than drivers typically lane-locked. Even young as she was, there weren’t enough years in her life to make it back. She drove anyway. 

For months, other truckers would visit her on their trips. They’d stop and talk or bring her things from the outside world (Coke, for example, simply didn’t taste the same from road gas stations). 

At first, it was bearable. Sometimes, for days, she would travel through pockets of space no one could follow her into, but even then there was the radio. She would chat for hours with her former co-workers. She stayed connected.

Her radio broke.

That in and of itself wasn’t a tragedy. It was weeks before she and another trucker crossed paths, but she *did* get another one. The real tragedy was the corrosion of a habit. The others had already gotten used to not talking with her. The memory of her was fading.

Her co-workers swapped out. Some died. Some found safer jobs. Some merely quit. Turnover had always been high. They didn’t stay just because she did, and those who *did* stay long term were running shorter hauls. They weren’t coming out as far as her. 

Visits slowed. 

They stopped.

Her radio broke again. No one brought her a new one.

Autumn had driven three years with communication to other drivers. She drove two more without it. Alone. 

No one remembered her. Those who did stopped caring. She was an uncomfortable reminder of what was to come. Better to push her to the back of the fridge and stock fresher produce to put in front.

Still, she drove.

What else was there to do?

She told herself it was determination. Grit. Convicts would live for thirty years in confinement and still manage to make a life for themselves once they got out; hope existed.

Except she wouldn’t get out. This was a life sentence. She wasn’t *delusional*, after all.

Or was she? Why did she continue to drive when she knew she was driving for a goal she would never reach?

Autumn wished she could stop.

She wished it would end.

She wished she’d stayed in college.

One day, on a long desert road, clouds had rolled in. Thick dark droplets of blood pooled on the hood of her rig. Her truck groaned, as if something was exerting pressure inwards. She’d heard of this. Other truckers said this was what happened when the road *noticed* you. Perhaps, finally, after these years, it was noticing her. It would grant her the blessing she was too deluded to grant herself: the ability to stop driving.

She was ready.

And then. Through the storm. Another truck appeared. Beyond all reason, superseding all logic, Autumn fled to it, got inside, met the driver, directed him to a town.

For the first time in years, she spoke with a real, actual human who wasn’t constructed by the road. A seed she thought had dried out long ago cracked open. A leaf pushed up through the dirt. 

*Oh yes,* she thought. *This is what it felt like to be alive.*

He had to go. She’d already known that, but he would be back. *Within the week,* he promised. Autumn bid him farewell and marked her calendar for his return, her one final connection to the real world. 

She waited a week.

She waited another.

She stopped waiting.

The sprout died, this time for real. Seeds can survive so much. It’s only when they open into plants they become fragile, vulnerable things. When Autumn woke in the mornings, in the seconds before she remembered where she was, she would reach for her keys. She would remember then that her vehicle was gone, crushed. She could no longer drive. She could no longer do…well, anything*.*

*I’m back*, a voice told her one day from a forbidden alleyway. *Me. Brendon.*

It wasn’t him. She knew that. You didn’t survive five years on the road without knowing that, and neither did the creature think she believed it. Perhaps it was only pretending out of the sheer habit. 

It didn’t really matter why.

There *had* been a point to driving after all. It had been a futile, empty purpose, but it had still been a purpose. Before, the future had stretched out like an empty highway. Now it opened like the blank chasm beyond a cliff.

*Come,* the thing in the alley had said.

*Alright then,* she’d told it. *Alright.*

And she’d gone.



**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**



At the time, I didn't know any of that. All I knew was that Autumn was screaming. 

The moment I crossed into the alley, the world changed. 

The temperature around me lowered a dozen degrees. My breath plumed outward in a cloud of steam. The brick walls turned flaky, like they were amateur paper mache creations made for the set of a theater production. The sky flickered―no, not flickered. *Throbbed*. Pulsing veins and arteries crisscrossed it.

Wherever I was, it wasn’t Route 333.

I sprinted past the edge of the alley, and the town immediately ended. Behind me, the buildings were hollow things, walls and roofs but no back walls. Through their windows filtered daylight from the Route 333 sun. Even the coffee shop I'd just come from was now the empty, movie-set version of a building, real only on the front side.

Before me lay a flat, gray landscape. Where I stepped, water rippled outwards, though my socks stayed dry. The only distinguishing feature were the bones of a house some distance off. No walls. Just a roof and support beams. Inside was a table.

On that table was Autumn.

“Brendon, no! I told you to stay away.”

She was pinned down. By what I couldn’t tell. Two creatures sat on either ends of the table, forks in hand. As I approached, their heads twisted unnaturally to face me―not their torsos, just the heads. One looked exactly like Gloria. 

The other was me. 

“Sit.” The not-Me pulled out a chair. It made no move to attack.

“I’m good, thanks.”

“If you refuse our hospitality, then depart. You were not invited here.”

“It’s a trick,” Autumn said. “Don’t try to leave. They can’t trade you if you stay willingly, and they won’t risk hurting you. They need―”

The not-Gloria shoved its hand into her mouth to silence her, like *directly* in her mouth. Autumn’s back arched and her head twisted back and forth, but she couldn’t dislodge it. Eventually, she stopped struggling and inhaled through her nostrils. The not-Gloria sat back down. It left its hand shoved in her mouth.

*Don’t leave, huh?*

“You things are the hitchhikers, aren't you?” I asked. 

They stayed silent, gripping their forks.

“No,” I said. “Not quite. The hitchhikers are on Route 333, trying to get off. You’re trying to get on, is that right? Why?”

“We can't get off until we've gotten on,” not-Me said.

 “You’ve interrupted our feasting,” not-Gloria hissed. “Leave us in peace.”

“All yours.” I took a seat. I waited.

It would be easy to assume that’s what they wanted with us: to eat us. That’s what scary monsters wanted in tales over campfires after all. Perhaps all these two creatures wanted was some quiet to feed on Autumn. I’d gotten lucky before. Why couldn’t I just assume I’d gotten lucky again and arrived the second before they ripped her to shreds? 

And yet…

This house, this table, this entire setup―it was all so like the rest of this place. A staged theater production. They’d been waiting for me.

“Go on then,” I said.

“You’re just going to let us eat her?” not-Me asked.

“She was kind of annoying anyway.”

They looked at each other.

“Very well,” not-Gloria said. She raised her fork, looking very much like a human convincing themselves that, *I guess I’m doing this. I’m really eating a person. Don’t think about it. Don’t think about it. Perhaps people taste like pork.*

“Don’t try to save her,” said not-Me.

“Wouldn’t dream of it.”

“Really,” said not-Gloria. “Don’t.”

They waited (for me to save her, I presume). I nodded encouragingly.

Not-Gloria lowered the fork.

“This is your whole thing then?” I asked. “You lure us here, and then you try and get us to leave again? So you can what? Trade us for what?”

Not-Me only stared.

“Well?” I demanded.

It sighed. It gestured at its companion, who removed their hand from Autumn’s mouth.

She spit. “I wouldn’t leave, so they were using me as bait. We have to want to leave or the road won’t let them trade us. They want passage to Route 333.”

“I told you last time,” I said. “You’ll have to pretend more convincingly if you want to fool us.”

Not-Me sneered. “We have already fooled you into crossing over. You’re human. You have to leave eventually. You can’t survive here forever.”

“Fine. So we die either way. Something tells me it’s still better to choose the option that doesn't involve helping you.” 

“We only need one of you,” said not-Gloria.

For the first time, that gave me pause. If they really only did need one of us that meant the other still had a chance at surviving.

I stood.

“I’m taking her,” I said. “She’s not leaving by her own choice, got it? No tradsies. Once I’ve put her back on the road, I’ll decide what to do with myself, but not before then.”

They said nothing, but they didn’t try to stop me as I struggled to unfasten the ropes holding Autumn down. After a minute of unsuccessfully tugging at a hand-restraint, not-Gloria scoffed. She pinched at the rope, and it tore apart as easily as string cheese. These things might not have a taste for human flesh, but they would still have no difficulty killing us.

They trailed behind me as I carried Autumn, feet still tied, towards the alley. It was telling of how long she’d been here that she didn’t fight me carrying her. Her breathing was heavy. She exuded fatigue. How long had it been since she’d eaten?

“What are you doing?” she whispered between breaths.

“Trust me.”

When I reached the boundary, I set her down and pushed her across with my foot. On the other side, she struggled into a sit.

“Now you,” not-Gloria said.

“No.”

“That was the deal.”

“We made no deal. I’m staying.” What would happen if I tried to leave? Would I turn to dust the moment I stepped across? Switch bodies with one of them? “I’ll starve on this side if I have to, but I’m not going.”

“We can still hurt you, stone-dweller,” not-Me said. “Torture. Blood-letting. Show you things you can’t unsee. Just ask the girl. You’ll wish you left when you had the chance.”

I took a breath and reached for the thing tucked into the lining of my pants. “You want me to leave so bad? Make me.”

I lunged.

It’s an odd sensation, stabbing your own face with a dinner fork. In a way, I think it made it easier. I wasn’t aiming for anything particular besides the general facial area, but I got lucky. The fork lodged in the creature’s throat and sunk deep. 

Not-Me might have been stronger than the real me, but I still had surprise on my side. I shoved my wide-eyed doppelganger against the wall and, like any surprised person would do in such a situation, it shoved me back. It withheld none of its strength.

I was hurled backwards. The air left me even before I slammed into the ground―the ground on the side of Route 333.

“*Deceit! Trickery!*” 

Not-Me ripped the fork from its neck. Black ichor spurted out. Then he and not-Gloria threw themselves at us but slammed into an invisible barrier.

I coughed and clutched my chest. *A couple broken ribs for sure.* 

I raised my hand at the shrieking creatures. “Thanks for the help.”



**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**



At first, they’d tried to trick her into leaving. That’s what Autumn told me. She wouldn’t though. She told them to do whatever terrible things they would to her. They’d decided to use her as bait instead.

Autumn explained that and everything else about her past to me as we swung our legs over the edge of a rickety bridge at the edge of town. She was still weak, but feeling stronger after eating for the first time in three days. The sun had risen and fallen, and day was turning to evening. Beneath us, enormous dark shapes moved through the water, occasionally pulsing with a bioluminescent, glowing green.

“What are they?” I’d asked Autumn.

“Jump in and find out.”

A cool evening breeze tickled the hairs on the back of my neck. 

She’d gone intentionally. She’d walked onto the side street knowing something terrible would happen.

“Autumn, I’m―”

“Don’t,” she said. “Don’t tell me you’re sorry. I don’t want your pity. I’m sick of pity. You should have come back sooner, but that doesn’t mean I should have thrown myself at something with teeth and claws. Just don’t―don’t think of me like something that needs to be coddled.”

“I don’t.”

“You say that, but people can’t help who they feel sorry for.”

I blew out through my mouth and tossed a pebble at the river below. Something thick and tongue-like lashed out for it.

“You weren’t the only one,” I said. “In the middle of that storm…well you saw me. I was like you, except I really had given up. I was just waiting. You save me. I save you.”

She tossed her own pebble. Multiple of the tentacle things fought for it. “This road’s really done a number on us, hasn’t it?”

“Not the road. For me, it’s just…life.” I snapped my fingers. “Before this job, my future was the openness beyond a cliff. Now, it’s a highway.”

“That’s my line. And you butchered it.”

I laughed.

For a while, we just sat in silence.

“They know,” I said. “The shape-shifter things. I still don’t understand the whole thing with us needing to ‘try to leave,’ but it all feels too close to lane-locking. Randall explained to me a few days ago how cargo rules work. Otherwise, we couldn’t transport living things. This just feels too similar.”

“So?”

“So they could have the answer. They might know how to get[ you out](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/).”

1. Luminous-Nucleus Parasites (CODE: [NL-Σ])

Description: Bioenergetic spheroidal entity, enclosed in an organic metallic shell.

Infection: Direct penetration into the chest (males) or below the sternum (females); neural cables connect to the nervous system.

Function: Body amplification, genetic mutation and cognitive alteration.


Variants:

Blue [NL-A]: Possessive protectors, act in defense of the host.

Red [NL-V]: Intensifies aggression and physical capabilities.

Purple [NL-R]: Mental symbiosis, expands cognition and perception.

Orange [NL-L]: Absolute host control (75% of the population).

Orange-Red [NL-LV]: Hybrid control, subtle manipulation of body and mind.

White [NL-B]: Rare; accelerate genetic evolution, resulting in superhumans.


Threat Level: HIGH – risk of mass contamination.


""Maybe we can use that one"" he thought as he took a sip of his coffee.

2. Insectiform Dronoid Parasites (CODE: [DI-Φ])

Description: Flying biomechanical organisms, resembling insect-like drones.

Infection: Fixation on the back of the neck; cables pierce skin/clothing until reaching the nervous system.

Function: Induce structural mutations: elongated limbs, superior reflexes, enhanced senses.

Behavior: Selective predators; only compatible hosts are targets.


Threat Level: MEDIUM-HIGH – focus on improvement, not extermination.


""It's not scary, it reminds me of a series too"" he said as he took out a piece of paper to write down ideas for use 

3. Living Suit Parasites (CODE: [LS-Ω])

Description: Organic masses that fuse with costumes, fursuits or locks.

Infection: Parasite awaits the use of the suit; connects fake organs to real ones, creating triple symbiosis (human + suit + parasite).

Function: Obsessive protectors; they do not destroy the host and even take care of them.

Special Variant [LS-B]: Suit Builders – mold their own armor over months, much more powerful.


Threat Level: VARIABLE – low in voluntary symbiosis, critical in full possession.


""This one we must use"" he pasted a note over the name

4. Climbing Parasites (CODE: [TT-Δ])

Description: Biological vine structures that wrap around the host.

Infection: Adhere externally; subtle filaments penetrate the skin for biological access.

Function: Increased strength and physical resistance; high energy consumption of the host.

Behavior: Symbiotic, but invasive and visible.


Threat Level: LOW – effects limited to the individual and possible civilian use.


""I agree, civil use is a good thing"" he added in another note

5. Synthetic Biomass Parasites (CODE: [BS-Ψ])

Origin: Human creation.

Description: Starts as a living puddle; molds itself according to programming.

Infection: Spreads through the head until it reaches the brain.

Function: Programmable → new limbs, organic weapons, tails, physical reinforcements.

Note: Totally dependent on human biotechnology to reach full potential.


Threat Level: VERY HIGH, militarizable, already in clandestine use.


""..."" He just felt that bitter gist of betrayal 

6. Regent Parasites (CODE: [PR-Θ])

Description: Anthropomorphic slime molded into the first animal absorbed (natural or fictional).

Infection: Slug larvae enter through the mouth, burrow into tissue and reach the brain.

Cologne:

Queen (Main Drone): First infected; maintains up to 95% of consciousness.

Drones: Workers, technicians, soldiers, engineers, incubators, scouts.

King: Creates, shapes and covers drones with biomass, transforming them into anthropomorphic forms.

Function: Hierarchical structure; capacity for large-scale social manipulation.

Rare cases: Formation of harems to maintain the Queen in massive colonies.


Threat Level: EXTREME – civilizational risk.


""I see potential"" he attached

FINAL ANALYSIS

""All species have evolutionary and symbiotic potential, but range from obsessive companionship (NL-A, LS) to global social dominance (PR-Θ). The study suggests an unacceptable risk if multiple species are introduced into the same human ecosystem.""

After the whole incident with Gloria and the thing in the dark, Randall gave me a week off. 

There was the physical trauma of it all (i.e. apparently you need stitches when someone literally bites a chunk from your neck?), but also just the mental exhaustion. I’d spent two weeks barely sleeping, driving 16+ hour days, slowly devolving into an anxious, self-loathing wreck. On top of that, I was now dealing with the knowledge that me and every one of my co-workers would one day be offered up as kindling for the fire that was ‘protecting humanity.’ *Oh, and by the way, you can’t tell them.* A week off sounded amazing.

Until it wasn’t.

It’s funny. We complain about work and errands and all the little things that add up to a stressful existence, but when they’re gone? We get bored so quickly.

Maybe that’s just me. I had no family or friends in California. I rarely watched TV. All my hobbies had disappeared years ago, along with my childhood belief that being a fully functioning adult was an achievable goal. It was on day four, around the umpteenth time I was considering calling my ex, Myra―because that’s what you do when you’re bored and spiraling―that I called Randall instead.

“You sure you’re ready to come back?” he asked.

“Nope.” I sighed. “But I’m coming anyway.”

“Did you at least use your time to finish the employee handbook?”

“Uh… sure.”

*Whoops.*

\*\*\*

Over the next week, Randall and I settled into a tentative sort of…*truce,* shall we say?

We didn’t stop hating each other. I didn’t stop glaring at him when I would turn in my keys, and he continued to assign me to rigs with broken internal AC units. He did stop being so much of a jerk, though. In turn, I made no more violent threats. 

*Relationship goals.*

It was a clear sign of how desperately management needed me that there was no retaliation for my confrontation. I’d literally assaulted my manager, broken his nose, and confirmed multiple times, point blank, that \*I had no regrets―\*and nothing. No punishment. No suspension. Not so much as a warning.

…Though I never did get that second raise I was offered. Guess you can’t trust what people promise you at knifepoint. 

For my first week back, management assigned me only short hauls. *Safe hauls,* if you will. They were usually saved for veteran employees with higher risk of lane-locking. 

It was like they were apologizing. Or maybe that they were afraid I’d fall apart if they let me stay on Route 333 for too long at once. Really, I was only falling apart when I *wasn’t* on it.

The most surprising result from the recent series of events, though, was how Randall actually began answering my questions. We’d talk over the radio as I drove.

“Who’s finding these impossibilities?” I asked one time. “Like hunting and caging them?”

“A few different organizations. Some private. Some government. They all know to reach out to companies like us, but I don’t actually know much about them. We only get involved when the impossibilities are contained.”

“So there’s other roads like Route 333?”

“A few. Not many.”

Another time, on an especially empty part of the desert, we talked nearly half an hour without breaking into screaming―our personal record.

“How come I could drive at normal speed with that crying thing in my trailer?” I asked. “If it’s lane-locked now, shouldn’t it have slowed me down too?”

“The road views things differently when they’re treated as cargo. Lane-locking only applies to the transporter.” Before I could respond, he continued. “*Don’t* ask about doing the same with humans. I know you’re about to. It wouldn’t work.”

“Why not? Has anybody actually *tried* putting humans in the back?”

“Here’s a tip to save both of us some time: assume some trucker before you has attempted any solution you can think up. However you carried Tiff, you’d go as slow as her. Trailer or front seat―it doesn’t matter where she’s sitting. She’d be a passenger not cargo. The road *knows* the difference.”

“How though?”

“Dunno. It can sniff intention, maybe? It knows that her and you are both the same species?”

“There has to be something truckers haven’t tried yet.”

“Nothing obvious.”

“And what happens if we do tell them before they lane-lock?” I asked. “What if we told Chris?”

“Have you ever heard of a driver named Douglas? He was marked for lane-locking, what was it, five years ago now? He noticed the signs before it happened, the ones we do tell you about. He quit. A week later a brand new driver, younger than you, lane-locked out of nowhere. She was the trade.”

“Was her name Autumn?”

A long pause.

“It was,” Randall said. With my short hauls, I still hadn't been able to visit her. “Look, let’s continue this tonight. We’ve been talking too long. There’s always a chance others are listening in.”

“Don’t they deserve to?”

In the distance, a dust devil rose up on the desert floor. Tumbleweeds bounced across the road.

“Really,” I pushed. “Maybe not everything. We don’t have to tell them about lane-locking for now, but they don’t even understand about impossibilities. Most of this is harmless. Why can't we tell them the basics?”

“You're free to.”

“I will.” 

“Will you?”

*Yes,* I nearly snapped back. *Of course.*

In my mind, I imagined it. Approaching the others in the break room and explaining what we were really doing on the road, about impossibilities and the things in the forest and why we should always carry a flashlight near dispatch.

I imagined the questions that would come after. 

More information always bred more questions. It had for me. It wouldn’t be long before they stumbled on the *right* questions, but didn’t they have a right to know? 

They would leave. Who wouldn’t? They’d leave, and another person would be marked by the road in their place. Something terrible would happen. Route 333 would retaliate.

It was the dilemma Randall and the others at dispatch had dealt with for years. I wanted to be better than them. I was actively trying to figure out a solution, but for the time being there was none. Did I let things be for now? Did I tell everyone, no matter the consequences?

“Maybe,” I told Randall.

When I made it back that night, I hesitated before I handed him my keys. “Send me on something longer.”

“Why?”

“Just do it.”

He did.

I went to visit Autumn.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

The town she’d stayed in was much the same as I remembered from three weeks previous. A bustling farmer’s market was in full-swing at a nearby park. Vendors and fruit stands filled the grassy area, and parents clutched to the hands of their squirming children. Main Street featured instrument shops and stores lined with vintage records.

The first place I checked for Autumn was the motel―no use. The room she’d stayed in before was now vacant.

“Is there anywhere else to stay around here?” I asked a maid wheeling past me with a cart.

She wasn’t at the second motel either. I tried the rest stop where we’d showered after that, and even took a turn wandering through the farmer’s market. It was eerie watching families interact, knowing they weren’t quite real. Did they know? Were they aware they’d been wandering this same outside market for months? That their children never aged?

I’d arrived to Autumn’s town in the morning. By noon, I was preparing to head out. I did *still* have a job to do, and there were only so many places I could check. Besides, I’d pass back through on the way home.

I was just exiting the doors of *Café Linda* after a brief pit stop when I heard it. A scream. I tossed my cup to the ground (not a big deal. The coffee was yet again terrible) and rushed the direction of the noise.

It came again. 

“Autumn!” I shouted.

 I skittered to a stop at the edge of an alleyway. The scream. The noise. It had come from beyond.

*A trick*. I knew this. Already, one of these things had impersonated Myra and another, Randall. One was merely doing it again. I’d be a fool if I really believed this was Autumn, however terrified the voice seemed. It was effective. Even knowing what I did, I was tempted to go down the alley. I *needed* to know if it was the real her.

A third shriek.

“Autumn!” It escaped my lips involuntarily.

“Stay back!” she shouted. “Don’t come!”

It was all the encouragement I needed to hurl myself down the side street toward her.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

But first.

Before we get into all that pesky, exciting action, let’s do something I’m *sure* you all love. 

Let’s pause.

She didn’t explain this all to me until much later that day, but before we proceed, there's some things you should know about Autumn. 

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

She did try college. Really, she did. The structure of it all just wasn’t for her. She tried hair school next (big mistake), then electrician work, then eventually, when she’d begun and dropped out of training for half a dozen different trades, she responded to an online advert for a nearby trucking company. It was more out of curiosity than anything. Surely, they couldn’t *actually* pay as much as they purported to.

They did.

Finally, she’d found something she didn’t loathe, that didn’t confine her mind to a monotonous box of monotonous details―what bleach to use on what shade of hair, what wire connected where. In fact, it didn’t confine her mind at all. That was the beauty of it. She could drive, in a trance, and she could think about the things she *wanted* to think about. Autumn wasn’t dumb; she learned quickly. The problem was merely trying to focus on things other people told her to focus on. 

For one year, she hauled on Route 333. Logically, she could drive it for another decade, maybe two. She was new. The road was still short to her. Others were driving on versions of Route 333 four times the length as hers, and they would still drive for years more. She went on the longer hauls that management assigned her to. Shorter hauls were for veteran truckers, not her. She didn’t need to worry. Not yet.

Then she lane-locked. 

It came suddenly. Without the usual warning signs. She’d been coming back from a longer haul at the time, further out than drivers typically lane-locked. Even young as she was, there weren’t enough years in her life to make it back. She drove anyway. 

For months, other truckers would visit her on their trips. They’d stop and talk or bring her things from the outside world (Coke, for example, simply didn’t taste the same from road gas stations). 

At first, it was bearable. Sometimes, for days, she would travel through pockets of space no one could follow her into, but even then there was the radio. She would chat for hours with her former co-workers. She stayed connected.

Her radio broke.

That in and of itself wasn’t a tragedy. It was weeks before she and another trucker crossed paths, but she *did* get another one. The real tragedy was the corrosion of a habit. The others had already gotten used to not talking with her. The memory of her was fading.

Her co-workers swapped out. Some died. Some found safer jobs. Some merely quit. Turnover had always been high. They didn’t stay just because she did, and those who *did* stay long term were running shorter hauls. They weren’t coming out as far as her. 

Visits slowed. 

They stopped.

Her radio broke again. No one brought her a new one.

Autumn had driven three years with communication to other drivers. She drove two more without it. Alone. 

No one remembered her. Those who did stopped caring. She was an uncomfortable reminder of what was to come. Better to push her to the back of the fridge and stock fresher produce to put in front.

Still, she drove.

What else was there to do?

She told herself it was determination. Grit. Convicts would live for thirty years in confinement and still manage to make a life for themselves once they got out; hope existed.

Except she wouldn’t get out. This was a life sentence. She wasn’t *delusional*, after all.

Or was she? Why did she continue to drive when she knew she was driving for a goal she would never reach?

Autumn wished she could stop.

She wished it would end.

She wished she’d stayed in college.

One day, on a long desert road, clouds had rolled in. Thick dark droplets of blood pooled on the hood of her rig. Her truck groaned, as if something was exerting pressure inwards. She’d heard of this. Other truckers said this was what happened when the road *noticed* you. Perhaps, finally, after these years, it was noticing her. It would grant her the blessing she was too deluded to grant herself: the ability to stop driving.

She was ready.

And then. Through the storm. Another truck appeared. Beyond all reason, superseding all logic, Autumn fled to it, got inside, met the driver, directed him to a town.

For the first time in years, she spoke with a real, actual human who wasn’t constructed by the road. A seed she thought had dried out long ago cracked open. A leaf pushed up through the dirt. 

*Oh yes,* she thought. *This is what it felt like to be alive.*

He had to go. She’d already known that, but he would be back. *Within the week,* he promised. Autumn bid him farewell and marked her calendar for his return, her one final connection to the real world. 

She waited a week.

She waited another.

She stopped waiting.

The sprout died, this time for real. Seeds can survive so much. It’s only when they open into plants they become fragile, vulnerable things. When Autumn woke in the mornings, in the seconds before she remembered where she was, she would reach for her keys. She would remember then that her vehicle was gone, crushed. She could no longer drive. She could no longer do…well, anything\*.\*

*I’m back*, a voice told her one day from a forbidden alleyway. *Me. Brendon.*

It wasn’t him. She knew that. You didn’t survive five years on the road without knowing that, and neither did the creature think she believed it. Perhaps it was only pretending out of the sheer habit. 

It didn’t really matter why.

There *had* been a point to driving after all. It had been a futile, empty purpose, but it had still been a purpose. Before, the future had stretched out like an empty highway. Now it opened like the blank chasm beyond a cliff.

*Come,* the thing in the alley had said.

*Alright then,* she’d told it. *Alright.*

And she’d gone.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

At the time, I didn't know any of that. All I knew was that Autumn was screaming. 

The moment I crossed into the alley, the world changed. 

The temperature around me lowered a dozen degrees. My breath plumed outward in a cloud of steam. The brick walls turned flaky, like they were amateur paper mache creations made for the set of a theater production. The sky flickered―no, not flickered. *Throbbed*. Pulsing veins and arteries crisscrossed it.

Wherever I was, it wasn’t Route 333.

I sprinted past the edge of the alley, and the town immediately ended. Behind me, the buildings were hollow things, walls and roofs but no back walls. Through their windows filtered daylight from the Route 333 sun. Even the coffee shop I'd just come from was now the empty, movie-set version of a building, real only on the front side.

Before me lay a flat, gray landscape. Where I stepped, water rippled outwards, though my socks stayed dry. The only distinguishing feature were the bones of a house some distance off. No walls. Just a roof and support beams. Inside was a table.

On that table was Autumn.

“Brendon, no! I told you to stay away.”

She was pinned down. By what I couldn’t tell. Two creatures sat on either ends of the table, forks in hand. As I approached, their heads twisted unnaturally to face me―not their torsos, just the heads. One looked exactly like Gloria. 

The other was me. 

“Sit.” The not-Me pulled out a chair. It made no move to attack.

“I’m good, thanks.”

“If you refuse our hospitality, then depart. You were not invited here.”

“It’s a trick,” Autumn said. “Don’t try to leave. They can’t trade you if you stay willingly, and they won’t risk hurting you. They need―”

The not-Gloria shoved its hand into her mouth to silence her, like *directly* in her mouth. Autumn’s back arched and her head twisted back and forth, but she couldn’t dislodge it. Eventually, she stopped struggling and inhaled through her nostrils. The not-Gloria sat back down. It left its hand shoved in her mouth.

*Don’t leave, huh?*

“You things are the hitchhikers, aren't you?” I asked. 

They stayed silent, gripping their forks.

“No,” I said. “Not quite. The hitchhikers are on Route 333, trying to get off. You’re trying to get on, is that right? Why?”

“We can't get off until we've gotten on,” not-Me said.

 “You’ve interrupted our feasting,” not-Gloria hissed. “Leave us in peace.”

“All yours.” I took a seat. I waited.

It would be easy to assume that’s what they wanted with us: to eat us. That’s what scary monsters wanted in tales over campfires after all. Perhaps all these two creatures wanted was some quiet to feed on Autumn. I’d gotten lucky before. Why couldn’t I just assume I’d gotten lucky again and arrived the second before they ripped her to shreds? 

And yet…

This house, this table, this entire setup―it was all so like the rest of this place. A staged theater production. They’d been waiting for me.

“Go on then,” I said.

“You’re just going to let us eat her?” not-Me asked.

“She was kind of annoying anyway.”

They looked at each other.

“Very well,” not-Gloria said. She raised her fork, looking very much like a human convincing themselves that, *I guess I’m doing this. I’m really eating a person. Don’t think about it. Don’t think about it. Perhaps people taste like pork.*

“Don’t try to save her,” said not-Me.

“Wouldn’t dream of it.”

“Really,” said not-Gloria. “Don’t.”

They waited (for me to save her, I presume). I nodded encouragingly.

Not-Gloria lowered the fork.

“This is your whole thing then?” I asked. “You lure us here, and then you try and get us to leave again? So you can what? Trade us for what?”

Not-Me only stared.

“Well?” I demanded.

It sighed. It gestured at its companion, who removed their hand from Autumn’s mouth.

She spit. “I wouldn’t leave, so they were using me as bait. We have to want to leave or the road won’t let them trade us. They want passage to Route 333.”

“I told you last time,” I said. “You’ll have to pretend more convincingly if you want to fool us.”

Not-Me sneered. “We have already fooled you into crossing over. You’re human. You have to leave eventually. You can’t survive here forever.”

“Fine. So we die either way. Something tells me it’s still better to choose the option that doesn't involve helping you.” 

“We only need one of you,” said not-Gloria.

For the first time, that gave me pause. If they really only did need one of us that meant the other still had a chance at surviving.

I stood.

“I’m taking her,” I said. “She’s not leaving by her own choice, got it? No tradsies. Once I’ve put her back on the road, I’ll decide what to do with myself, but not before then.”

They said nothing, but they didn’t try to stop me as I struggled to unfasten the ropes holding Autumn down. After a minute of unsuccessfully tugging at a hand-restraint, not-Gloria scoffed. She pinched at the rope, and it tore apart as easily as string cheese. These things might not have a taste for human flesh, but they would still have no difficulty killing us.

They trailed behind me as I carried Autumn, feet still tied, towards the alley. It was telling of how long she’d been here that she didn’t fight me carrying her. Her breathing was heavy. She exuded fatigue. How long had it been since she’d eaten?

“What are you doing?” she whispered between breaths.

“Trust me.”

When I reached the boundary, I set her down and pushed her across with my foot. On the other side, she struggled into a sit.

“Now you,” not-Gloria said.

“No.”

“That was the deal.”

“We made no deal. I’m staying.” What would happen if I tried to leave? Would I turn to dust the moment I stepped across? Switch bodies with one of them? “I’ll starve on this side if I have to, but I’m not going.”

“We can still hurt you, stone-dweller,” not-Me said. “Torture. Blood-letting. Show you things you can’t unsee. Just ask the girl. You’ll wish you left when you had the chance.”

I took a breath and reached for the thing tucked into the lining of my pants. “You want me to leave so bad? Make me.”

I lunged.

It’s an odd sensation, stabbing your own face with a dinner fork. In a way, I think it made it easier. I wasn’t aiming for anything particular besides the general facial area, but I got lucky. The fork lodged in the creature’s throat and sunk deep. 

Not-Me might have been stronger than the real me, but I still had surprise on my side. I shoved my wide-eyed doppelganger against the wall and, like any surprised person would do in such a situation, it shoved me back. It withheld none of its strength.

I was hurled backwards. The air left me even before I slammed into the ground―the ground on the side of Route 333.

“*Deceit! Trickery!*” 

Not-Me ripped the fork from its neck. Black ichor spurted out. Then he and not-Gloria threw themselves at us but slammed into an invisible barrier.

I coughed and clutched my chest. *A couple broken ribs for sure.* 

I raised my hand at the shrieking creatures. “Thanks for the help.”

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

At first, they’d tried to trick her into leaving. That’s what Autumn told me. She wouldn’t though. She told them to do whatever terrible things they would to her. They’d decided to use her as bait instead.

Autumn explained that and everything else about her past to me as we swung our legs over the edge of a rickety bridge at the edge of town. She was still weak, but feeling stronger after eating for the first time in three days. The sun had risen and fallen, and day was turning to evening. Beneath us, enormous dark shapes moved through the water, occasionally pulsing with a bioluminescent, glowing green.

“What are they?” I’d asked Autumn.

“Jump in and find out.”

A cool evening breeze tickled the hairs on the back of my neck. 

She’d gone intentionally. She’d walked onto the side street knowing something terrible would happen.

“Autumn, I’m―”

“Don’t,” she said. “Don’t tell me you’re sorry. I don’t want your pity. I’m sick of pity. You should have come back sooner, but that doesn’t mean I should have thrown myself at something with teeth and claws. Just don’t―don’t think of me like something that needs to be coddled.”

“I don’t.”

“You say that, but people can’t help who they feel sorry for.”

I blew out through my mouth and tossed a pebble at the river below. Something thick and tongue-like lashed out for it.

“You weren’t the only one,” I said. “In the middle of that storm…well you saw me. I was like you, except I really had given up. I was just waiting. You save me. I save you.”

She tossed her own pebble. Multiple of the tentacle things fought for it. “This road’s really done a number on us, hasn’t it?”

“Not the road. For me, it’s just…life.” I snapped my fingers. “Before this job, my future was the openness beyond a cliff. Now, it’s a highway.”

“That’s my line. And you butchered it.”

I laughed.

For a while, we just sat in silence.

“They know,” I said. “The shape-shifter things. I still don’t understand the whole thing with us needing to ‘try to leave,’ but it all feels too close to lane-locking. Randall explained to me a few days ago how cargo rules work. Otherwise, we couldn’t transport living things. This just feels too similar.”

“So?”

“So they might have the answer. They could know how to get[ you out](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/).”

1nswjna,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nswjna/the_drying_rack_debacle_and_our_unexpected_truce/,The Drying Rack Debacle and Our Unexpected Truce,"I swear, for a minute there, I was convinced our kitchen's drying rack was actually a permanent art installation. Every single morning, without fail, it was overflowing. A teetering tower of Liam's pasta bowls, Chloe's carefully hand-washed mugs, and Sam's mysteriously tiny saucepans. My internal monologue was basically a lowkey scream, compiling a mental list of all the passive-aggressive texts I *could* send but never would. It was springtime, and the fresh air was *not* making the stagnant kitchen vibe any better.

Honestly, living with Liam, Chloe, and Sam in our urban apartment was usually pretty chill. Liam, our resident graphic designer, was a creative genius, but his concept of ""drying"" was apparently ""leave indefinitely."" Chloe, our meticulous grad student, kept her own space pristine but somehow developed a blind spot for communal areas when things piled up. And Sam, bless his quiet heart, would just silently do his own dishes and then retreat, leaving the chaos for the rest of us. I loved them, no cap, but my patience was wearing thin. I found myself hovering, debating whether to just unload everything, knowing I'd feel resentful, or leave it, knowing the tension would just thicken. The drying rack wasn't just metal and plastic; it was a monument to our unspoken frustrations.

One particularly sunny Tuesday, after I had to precariously balance my clean coffee mug on a pile of Liam's ""drying"" Tupperware, something in me just snapped. I didn't yell. I didn't even sigh dramatically. I just… took a picture of the offending pile and sent it to our group chat with a single, unambiguous emoji: 😬. Then I typed, ""House meeting. 7 PM. Kitchen. We need to talk."" I braced myself.

To my surprise, everyone showed up on time. Liam looked genuinely sheepish, Chloe already looking stressed but also a little relieved, and Sam, for once, was actually the first to speak. ""Yeah, I know. It's been getting pretty bad,"" he admitted. ""I just didn't want to be the one to bring it up."" Liam chimed in, ""My bad, guys. I just get so focused on a design, I literally forget the dishes exist."" Chloe added, ""And then I see it, and I just get so overwhelmed, I procrastinate."" That's so valid, I thought. We realized we were all kinda doing the same thing: avoiding confrontation and letting small issues build into silent resentment.

Instead of assigning blame, we brainstormed. We decided to ditch the informal ""whoever sees it, does it"" rule for a rotating ""kitchen lead"" duty. One person each week would be responsible for ensuring the drying rack was clear, the counters wiped, and the trash taken out. We even set up a shared note in our phones for communal grocery items like dish soap and paper towels, so no one person was shouldering the cost all the time. It felt like a massive weight lifted, honestly. The air felt lighter, the kitchen actually cleaner. That night, after we'd all pitched in for a massive kitchen reset, we ordered pizza and watched a cheesy movie, genuinely laughing together. It turns out, sometimes you just need to talk out the uncomfortable stuff to actually build real community. We love to see it.

""NICK nick nick niCK NICK NICALODeAN!
My Nickelodeon alarm barks at me like a drill sergeant. It's six thirty am. Anxiety and dread slowly seep into my 12-year-old mind. Today is the first day back from summer break. The smell of beef top ramen quells the annoying emotions for a moment. Mom is making my favorite breakfast. 

I put on a pair of pants I had laid out the night before and threw on my favorite Toy Machine hoodie. I stare at the wall for a moment then I hear our mom yell ""Boyyyysss breakfast!""

My mom is in her robe and she smells like cigarettes and coffee. I love my mom.  The Pokémon theme song starts and my brother slides into the kitchen. We start singing together smiling ""Ohhh you're my best friend in a world we must defend POKEMON!!!!!"" I can still sing it word for word. We sit at the table and blow and slurp on our noodles like in an anime. Warm and partially fed, I run to my room my big dorky brown trombone case. It's almost as big as me.

The fog is thick like whipped cream as we open the front door. We trot down the old rickety wooden porch steps and try not to slip. We pretend to smoke cigarettes with the steam from our warm breaths as we walk through the frosted dirt field.   I can hear the clack of the hacky sack and the laughter of my friends up ahead at the bus stop. Suddenly they appeared as we made way through the thick creamy fog. 

They make room for us in the circle and I watch the sac pounce from foot to foot. Everyone is smiling and laughing without a care for what life will eventually become. The loud rumbling of the school bus beckons in the distance like an avalanche getting closer. It's telling us to get ready. I hit the sack one more time and catch it mid-air. So cool. I grab my dorky trombone case and put it in the storage below the seats. I'm always last on the bus.  Slim Shady is playing on the radio as I get on the bus.

This community has been SOOOOOOOOO helpful and kind in suggestions and queries for my newbie a*s, so grateful about it.           
**Part 1 (swipe)**.     
**1)Lattafa khamrah** : My first ever decant and i got this purely because of reviews and hype around it and this didn't disappoint me. It smells like cinnamon and vanilla and then settles into more woody dark smell . 
I don't get any/much sweetness in it infacts to me it smells a bit dark and masculine leaning fragrance.          
*Performance* I never knew what beast mode meant until i sprayed it for first time ever to try it out and it stayed on my top for next WHOLE 3 DAYS on the first day the single spray was so strong everyone in my home noticed.       
*Full bottle worthy?*I don't need to buy the full bottle when 1-2 sprays are enough for whole day plus it can only be used in winters so 30ml gonna last me a long long time.      
This wont disappoint you , get a decant and try out .         
9/10         
.
**2) Qahwa** :  I get the lil sweetness which was missing in og , To me the initial smell of this is like masala chai without the milk , this is like og + ginger and lil bit of coffee.        
I got this because i really wanted a perfume with a  coffee note but this is not it . This sadly didn't worked for me , this is darker and much definitely masculine leaning fragrance.       
*Performance* : Same as og infact the projection is tad bit better than og .         
*Full bottle worthy?* : Not for me , infact i wont use this at all when going out .          
3/10 .         
.
**3)Nebras** : I wanted a good gourmand for winter and this was suggested other than eclaire. When i read 'sugar' as one of the notes i was confused and when i recived it all i could smell was sugar . After couple of months i can smell the faint chocolate too but sugar is still the most dominating note. I will let this sit for a while. Also this is a clone if eilish if you have the og please lmk how similar they are?        
*Performance* : This is too sweet so don't over spray , couple of sprays are enough to last whole day with amazing projection.       
*Full bottle?* : No , its really sweet and i may wear this once in a while but thats it .           
8/10.       
.
**4)NR musc noir rose** : My most expensive decant/ perfume in terms of per ml cost 🥀. I tried so hard to find a dupe for it and there was none so i finally went for this.     
I wanted a perfect date night perfume thats unique and sexy and seductive and luxurious and 100 more things, this was the one thats the most suggested in that criteria.         
This smells so beautiful and classy , opens with this powdery musky rose like scent and you get vanilla only after it settles down . Nothing too complex ,  the plum isn't bitter or dark its just perfect . I said rose like because the rose is pretty faint . Did this satisfy all my criteria? Yes BUT BUT BUT .     
*Performance* 😭😭😭 this lasts for like 30 mins , For a fragrance thats this expensive its performance is a big damn joke . After 30 mins it will still be there but with no projection and you can only smell it if you sniff it directly where you applied. I once applied like 10 sprays of this to test and it was gone in less than an hour and this was on a cold night on a hot night this might just disappear within 15 mins.       
*Full bottle worthy?* : NO , PLEASE LISTEN TO ME , if you liked it , try its decant first or just trust me about the performance and get only if you are cool with re spraying every 30 mins .            
.
I am still looking for a perfume thats satisfy my #4 criteria , please suggest if you have any recommendations.        
Thanks for reading.

1nswgit,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nswgit/where_to_buy_an_espresso_machine_online_safely/,Where to buy an espresso machine online safely?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on quite a journey trying to find the perfect espresso machine for my home, and I thought I'd share my experience to help others who might be in the same boat.

After months of research and dealing with a few sketchy online sellers, I finally found a reliable place to buy quality espresso machines. Trust me, I learned the hard way that not all online retailers are created equal, especially when it comes to coffee equipment.

I recently bought my dream espresso machine from this trusted seller: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. The whole experience was smooth, and I got exactly what I was looking for at a great price.

Here's what I've learned about buying espresso machines online:

1. Always check return policies
2. Look for detailed product descriptions
3. Verify warranty information
4. Read authentic customer reviews
5. Compare prices across platforms

One thing that really matters is getting your machine from an authorized dealer. Counterfeit coffee equipment is surprisingly common, and you definitely don't want to end up with a fake that could break down or worse, be unsafe to use.

I've noticed that many first-time buyers focus only on price, but there's so much more to consider. Things like bar pressure, water tank capacity, and whether it has a built-in grinder can make a huge difference in your daily coffee routine.

Speaking of daily routines, my morning coffee game has completely changed since getting my machine. If you're thinking about taking the plunge, I highly recommend checking out the selection at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. They have options for every budget and skill level.

Here are some quick tips for maintaining your machine once you get it:

- Clean it regularly
- Use filtered water
- Descale every few months
- Keep the portafilter dry between uses
- Don't skip the warm-up time

I remember being overwhelmed by all the options when I first started looking for an espresso machine. But honestly, once you find a reliable seller and know what features matter to you, it becomes much easier to make a decision.

For beginners, I'd suggest starting with a semi-automatic machine. They offer a good balance between control and ease of use. Plus, they're usually more affordable than fully automatic models while still delivering great results.

The most important thing is to buy from a reputable source. There's nothing worse than spending hundreds of dollars on a machine only to find out it's not genuine or that you can't get support when you need it.

I hope this helps anyone who's been wondering about where to safely buy an espresso machine online. Feel free to ask any questions - I'm always happy to chat about coffee!",1,1759085876.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I (19M) met a girl (23F) last year while working together at a bar. Back then she mostly kept to herself and usually went home alone (even though most of us went together). I already liked her at the time, but she had a boyfriend.

Our first ever conversation was short — she asked me how old I was. On the last day the bar was open that year, she asked our boss to take a group photo of our team. Two weeks later, our boss organized an event for all of us. At the event, she asked me why I don’t drink, and when I told her I don’t know, she said: “Maybe we can drink together next year.”

At the end of the event, she asked me if I could bring her to the train station since her boyfriend was waiting there. I agreed since I live near there and it was already dark. At the station, she then asked me if I could stay until her boyfriend arrived — which I thought was a bit weird, but I agreed. After about 10 minutes he came, she introduced us, he didn’t say anything, and she got into his car. That was it for 2024.

This year (2025)

When I went back to the bar for the first time this summer, she was sitting on the terrace. As soon as she saw me, she hugged me excitedly and said my name.

We got closer at work this time. She leaned her head on my chest once, held my biceps, brushed crumbs off my shirt, and we often went home together. She also gave me her number.

Our first café meeting ( coffee shop)

I invited her to my other workplace (coffee shop ). She replied within 2 minutes and came. I closed the shop and since I’m shy, I didn’t know exactly what to do. So after 30 minutes we were  at her bus station, she then said said ,,Let’s walk” and  night continued for 3 hours. We talked a lot. She told me she’d like me to meet her parents if they come. She also told me she moved to this country in May 2024 and broke up with her boyfriend in November 2024. She explained why they broke up. She also made me touch her knee since she had an injury there and other stuff . 

My confession 

After that, I only saw her once more at work. Then, 3 weeks later I confessed over WhatsApp that I liked her. She said she sees me more as a friend, but doesn’t want things to end.

Two weeks later, I got fired from the bar after an argument with my boss. I was removed from the group chat, and 2 hours later she texted me. I then called her and explained what happened. Two hours later she texted me again, saying she also wants to quit and asked me what she should write him. We laughed, I gave her advice, and she said if I’m working at the coffee shop  I should let her know so she would come.

The next day she texted again, asking me to come with her to the bar to hand in her resignation. I agreed.

The resignation day 

We met and went there together. This was the first time we saw each other since my confession.

On the way, I asked if she dyed her hair. She said yes and asked: “Do you like it?” I said yes, it looks good. She replied: “I don’t believe you.” I laughed and said: “Why? It looks good.”

At the bar, she gave her resignation. She told me her parents knew about the situation and me being fired, and said: “They said I can also quit. We are friends.” (She hesitated a bit before saying “friends.” I just chuckled.)

At the train station she asked: “Are we finished?” I said yes since she was the one who asked me to come. Then she asked if I was “taking this side” (the same question she had once asked before my confession, and again now, even though she knew the answer). She also asked me when I’m working at the café again. I said I think Sunday.

Then I asked if she wanted to eat something. She said: “If you want to.” I didn’t reply since it felt like she didn’t want to. After 5 seconds of silence she added: “Like pizza.” I just left it hanging. We hugged and went separate ways.

Next meeting  

Two weeks later, I asked her if she wanted to come again. She agreed and came at around 5 pm. We hugged and talked while I was working.

At around  7 she asked if she could help so I gave her an apron and she helped me close the shop. When we left, she pulled out a lollipop. I laughed and pulled one out too, since I always used to give her one at work. We exchanged them.

She also gave me her phone to put my Instagram. I told her I had already seen her account but wasn’t sure if I should follow her. She asked: “Why?” and I didn’t answer.

We passed a restaurant and she said: “Look.” I said: “Let’s go there next time,” since she had told me earlier she wasn’t hungry.

At the bus station she asked how I’m going home. I said: “I’ll see,” since I didn’t want the night to end. She then said she’d probably walk home, so I told her I’d walk with her.

We walked and talked about everything. She got a call from her mom and told me: “My mom says hi.”

At midnight we arrived at her place. We hugged and she told me I should text her when I got home. 

Second meeting 

Two weeks later, I asked her again if she wanted to go eat something. She agreed.

One hour before she came, she asked me if I like cheesecake. I said yes — I thought she’d maybe buy some. But when she arrived (6:30 pm), she came with two pieces of cheesecake on a plate wrapped in cling film. She gave it to me right away and said: “You have to eat the cake now, I need the plate back.”

She asked me if I liked it and if it was too sweet. I said it was perfect. I asked if she baked it, she said yes.

When she first arrived, I asked if she wanted something to drink. She said water. I know she doesn’t like tap water, but that’s all I had, so I gave her a glass. After 10 minutes I left the shop, went across the street, and bought her sparkling water since that’s what she normally drinks. When I gave it to her she said thanks.

She also told me that she wanted to do the group picture last year to show her parents me.

After I closed the shop, we went to the restaurant we had passed last time. We ate and I paid. She said it wasn’t fair that I paid when she only gave me cheesecake. I told her that was enough for me.

After dinner, we walked. At the train station she asked how I was going home. I said: “Let’s walk.” She agreed.

On the walk she asked me if I’d like to visit Barcelona (where she’s from). I said sure. She said: “Maybe we can plan it.” I said: “Why not.” I 

We talked about our future, hobbies, and everything else. She mentioned there’s a Korean place near her university that we could go to one day after class. She also said she only has class Monday and Friday.

At around 1:00 am we arrived at her place. That was the end of the night.

Where I’m at now

That was a week ago. She’s traveling in 5 days. Right now I don’t know what we are. She’s brought me cake, said things like “maybe we can plan a trip,” introduced me (indirectly) to her mom, and wants to work with me at the café next year. But I’m always the one asking to meet.

We don’t text daily  only when organizing something or when something specific happens.

She has class tomorrow, so theoretically that would be the perfect excuse for her to text me. What do u guys think is this moving forward?

1nswf5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Clean_Government5501/comments/1nswf5j/daily_productivity_mastery_transform_your_days/,Daily Productivity Mastery: Transform Your Days with These Proven Strategies,"# 

 our fast-paced world, mastering daily productivity isn't just about getting more done—it's about creating a life that feels purposeful, balanced, and deeply satisfying. Whether you're an entrepreneur juggling multiple projects, a professional climbing the corporate ladder, or someone simply wanting to make the most of each day, developing consistent productive habits can transform your entire life experience.

# The Foundation of Daily Productivity Success

Daily productivity starts with understanding that small, consistent actions compound into extraordinary results. It's not about cramming more tasks into your day or working until exhaustion. Instead, it's about creating systems that help you work smarter, not harder.

The most productive people don't rely on motivation alone—they build habits that run on autopilot. Research shows that up to 40% of our daily actions are habits, which means once you establish productive routines, they become second nature.

# Morning Routines That Set You Up for Success

# Start Before the World Wakes Up

The early morning hours offer a unique advantage: minimal distractions and maximum mental clarity. Successful individuals like Tim Cook and Oprah Winfrey swear by their early morning routines.

Consider incorporating these elements into your morning:

**Hydration First**: Your brain is 75% water, and after 6-8 hours without fluids, it needs replenishment to function optimally.

**Movement Matters**: Even 10 minutes of light exercise or stretching increases blood flow to the brain, improving focus and energy throughout the day.

**Mindful Moments**: Whether it's meditation, journaling, or simply sitting quietly with your coffee, starting with intention sets a positive tone for everything that follows.

# The Power of Priority Setting

Before diving into emails or checking social media, spend 5 minutes identifying your three most important tasks for the day. This practice, often called ""eating the frog,"" ensures you tackle high-impact activities when your mental energy is at its peak.

# Time Management Strategies That Actually Work

# The Pomodoro Technique Revolution

This simple yet powerful method involves working in focused 25-minute intervals followed by 5-minute breaks. After four cycles, take a longer 15-30 minute break. This technique works because it:

* Maintains high levels of focus
* Prevents mental fatigue
* Creates a sense of urgency that combats procrastination
* Provides regular opportunities to assess progress

# Energy-Based Scheduling

Not all hours are created equal. Pay attention to your natural energy patterns and schedule demanding tasks during your peak hours. For most people, this is mid-morning, but everyone's rhythm is different.

Match your tasks to your energy levels:

* **High energy**: Creative work, problem-solving, important decisions
* **Medium energy**: Routine tasks, emails, administrative work
* **Low energy**: Planning, organizing, light reading

# Creating Systems for Sustainable Productivity

# The Two-Minute Rule

If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately rather than adding it to your to-do list. This prevents small tasks from accumulating and becoming overwhelming.

# Batch Similar Activities

Grouping similar tasks together reduces the mental energy lost in task-switching. For example:

* Process all emails at designated times
* Make all phone calls in one session
* Prepare meals for the week in one cooking session

# Digital Minimalism for Focus

In our hyperconnected world, managing digital distractions is crucial for maintaining productivity. Consider these strategies:

**Notification Management**: Turn off non-essential notifications during focused work periods.

**App Organization**: Keep productivity apps easily accessible while moving time-wasting apps to less convenient locations.

**Designated Phone-Free Times**: Create periods where you're completely disconnected from devices to allow for deep focus.

# Building Habits That Stick

# Start Ridiculously Small

The key to building lasting productive habits is starting smaller than you think necessary. Want to exercise daily? Start with just five minutes. Want to read more? Begin with one page per day.

Small habits are easy to maintain and create momentum. Once established, they naturally grow into more substantial practices.

# The Habit Stack Method

Link new productive habits to existing routines. For example: ""After I pour my morning coffee, I will review my daily priorities"" or ""After I sit down at my desk, I will spend two minutes organizing my workspace.""

# Measuring and Optimizing Your Progress

# Weekly Reviews for Continuous Improvement

Dedicate 15 minutes each week to reviewing what worked well and what didn't. Ask yourself:

* Which productive habits felt natural and sustainable?
* What obstacles prevented you from being productive?
* How can you adjust your systems for better results?

# Celebrate Small Wins

Acknowledging progress, no matter how small, reinforces positive behaviors and maintains motivation. Keep a simple log of daily accomplishments to track your consistency and growth.

# Avoiding Common Productivity Pitfalls

# The Perfectionism Trap

Perfectionism often masquerades as high standards but actually kills productivity. Done is better than perfect, especially for tasks that don't require absolute precision.

# Overcommitment and Saying No

Being productive means being selective about commitments. Every ""yes"" to one thing is a ""no"" to something else. Protect your time and energy for activities that align with your most important goals.

# Creating Your Personal Productivity Blueprint

The most effective productivity system is one tailored to your unique lifestyle, preferences, and goals. Start by experimenting with the strategies outlined above, but remember that consistency matters more than perfection.

Begin with one or two techniques that resonate most with you. Master these before adding additional elements to your productivity toolkit. Remember, the goal isn't to become a productivity machine—it's to create more time and energy for the things that matter most to you.

Your journey to daily productivity mastery starts with a single step. Choose one strategy from this post and commit to trying it for just one week. Notice how it affects your energy, focus, and overall satisfaction with your days.

The compound effect of small, daily improvements will surprise you. In just 30 days of consistent application, you'll likely find yourself accomplishing more while feeling less stressed and more in control of your time.

Yesterday, he ate his and was gushing about how good it was. Then he asked me if I wanted the other sample, and I said yes, but not right then, I told him I was saving it for the next morning to have with my coffee.

This morning, I wake up and the chocolate is gone. I notice the wrapper in the trash. I ask my partner if he ate it and he says yes. I ask him when, and he admits he ate it last night before we went to bed, while I was already in bed. When I asked why, he literally said it was because he “wanted to eat it and felt like it.”

I got really upset because he knew I was planning to have it with my coffee the next morning. I ended up lashing out and starting a fight about it. Instead of apologizing, he told me I was overreacting because “it was just chocolate.” To me, though, it feels extremely selfish, and honestly, this isn’t the first time he’s pulled stuff like this.

On the way, I asked if she dyed her hair. She said yes and asked: “Do you like it?” I said yes, it looks good. She replied: “I don’t believe you.” I laughed and said: “Why? It looks good.”

At the bar, she gave her resignation. She told me her parents knew about the situation and me being fired, and said: “They said I can also quit. We are friends.” (She hesitated a bit before saying “friends.” I just chuckled.)

At the train station she asked: “Are we finished?” I said yes since she was the one who asked me to come. Then she asked if I was “taking this side” (the same question she had once asked before my confession, and again now, even though she knew the answer). She also asked me when I’m working at the café again. I said I think Sunday.

Then I asked if she wanted to eat something. She said: “If you want to.” I didn’t reply since it felt like she didn’t want to. After 5 seconds of silence she added: “Like pizza.” I just left it hanging. We hugged and went separate ways.

Next meeting  

Two weeks later, I asked her if she wanted to come again. She agreed and came at around 5 pm. We hugged and talked while I was working.

At around  7 she asked if she could help so I gave her an apron and she helped me close the shop. When we left, she pulled out a lollipop. I laughed and pulled one out too, since I always used to give her one at work. We exchanged them.

She also gave me her phone to put my Instagram. I told her I had already seen her account but wasn’t sure if I should follow her. She asked: “Why?” and I didn’t answer.

We passed a restaurant and she said: “Look.” I said: “Let’s go there next time,” since she had told me earlier she wasn’t hungry.

At the bus station she asked how I’m going home. I said: “I’ll see,” since I didn’t want the night to end. She then said she’d probably walk home, so I told her I’d walk with her.

We walked and talked about everything. She got a call from her mom and told me: “My mom says hi.”

At midnight we arrived at her place. We hugged and she told me I should text her when I got home. 

Second meeting 

Two weeks later, I asked her again if she wanted to go eat something. She agreed.

One hour before she came, she asked me if I like cheesecake. I said yes — I thought she’d maybe buy some. But when she arrived (6:30 pm), she came with two pieces of cheesecake on a plate wrapped in cling film. She gave it to me right away and said: “You have to eat the cake now, I need the plate back.”

She asked me if I liked it and if it was too sweet. I said it was perfect. I asked if she baked it, she said yes.

When she first arrived, I asked if she wanted something to drink. She said water. I know she doesn’t like tap water, but that’s all I had, so I gave her a glass. After 10 minutes I left the shop, went across the street, and bought her sparkling water since that’s what she normally drinks. When I gave it to her she said thanks.

She also told me that she wanted to do the group picture last year to show her parents me.

After I closed the shop, we went to the restaurant we had passed last time. We ate and I paid. She said it wasn’t fair that I paid when she only gave me cheesecake. I told her that was enough for me.

After dinner, we walked. At the train station she asked how I was going home. I said: “Let’s walk.” She agreed.

On the walk she asked me if I’d like to visit Barcelona (where she’s from). I said sure. She said: “Maybe we can plan it.” I said: “Why not.” 

We talked about our future, hobbies, and everything else. She mentioned there’s a Korean place near her uni that we could go to one day after class. She also said she only has class Monday and Friday.

At around 1:00 am we arrived at her place. That was the end of the night.

Where I’m at now

That was a week ago. She’s traveling in 5 days. Right now I don’t know what we are. She’s brought me cake, said things like “maybe we can plan a trip,” introduced me (indirectly) to her mom, and wants to work with me at the café next year. But I’m always the one asking to meet.

We don’t text daily  only when organizing something or when something specific happens.

She has class tomorrow, so theoretically that would be the perfect excuse for her to text me. What do u guys think is this moving fire or not ?

Hey folks,  
I’ve been tinkering with a long-form isekai/progression fantasy idea and wanted to test the waters. This is the prologue (working title still TBD).

The vibe:

* Trio of friends accidentally thrown into another world, with no legend, No hero summon. Just Wild magic doing whatever it wants to 3 mid 30's Out of shape friends.
* Guild systems, Classes, and Guild branches shaped by ancient precursor tech.
* A world where *everyone* has limits — except our protagonists, whose show “Limit Error.”
* RPG systems, heavy world building, progression from rock-bottom (literally level 0) into the unknown. Some notable talents and skills, that they do not know how to use.

I’d love to know:

* Does the prologue hook you?
* Would you keep reading?

Here’s the prologue:

The Prologue: Getting To Know The Situation. 

 A day like any other is what you expect right? You think to yourself, the same crap, different shovel. But that is always when things take a turn. This isn’t like that though the homies and me together again. That’s the good stuff that doesn’t come around as often as we like and that does indeed make it a special day. So on this special day we are chilling in the kitchen on a regular Monday evening. I’m cooking meat, as one does when the homies are over. 

Shane is making coffee because he's an addict. And cheesy mashed potatoes as he is skilled in. John is recounting a video he saw about a popular game that's coming out that he thinks we will like, we know each other pretty well and he's always got his ear to the ground for that type of thing as where i avoid that type of hype purposely and Shane while he knows typically doesn’t dish too much. He will throw out a name or type of game here and there but mostly it's in John's hands to dish the details. 

But it's a delicate balance, It works for us. After this conversation subsides I bring up the topic of Isekai Anime. I've been watching a lot of them lately and I’ve got it in my head that I want to write one of my own. Featuring the 3 of us of course because what if 3 bros got transported to a new world instead of either 1 super powered player/entity/dude/girl or a bunch of randos expected to work together to thwart some great disaster with no real teamwork. Which I mean, each story has its charms and its in’s and out's, its unique features, its different levels of comparability to our own world. 

Obviously I like them enough to theorize my own version and put in the time and effort to world building right? Easily I was able to come up with possible classes for the two of them and some approximate stats, We all know Shane is Maxed out charisma stat, and Constitution stat with ambiguous other stats related to magic casting, he's always been the most knowledgeable in Tabletop games, Role Plays and Stories about magic so he was obviously the solid choice for our Caster, though with his high Tank stats it would certainly throw any for a loop in a magical Fantasy world For him to be the Mage. 

John on the other hand, me and him play role play games together sometimes, I’m a better talker and he’s a better stealth/risk management person so In my view, moral Implications aside he would be a solid choice for a Rogue esque character though he typically plays undead in one of our favorite replay games. So I joked that he would be our rogue Lich. He was like “I'd feel kinda weird being the only undead” so I got a laugh out of it regardless. He's definitely our Dexterity stat and strategy guy, though when it came to table tops, Shane was always 3 steps ahead. I often joke that he's too good at them. That leaves me to the point that I really had to figure out what i would be… and as typical With a wealth of knowledge and observation for others. No idea what I would even do. 

While I usually play a healer/support in Video Games, that would leave the front line with much to be desired. Though Shane could tank it wouldn’t make him a very effective magic caster if like in some games spell casting could be interrupted by attacks. Though, hadn’t even thought of that till now so Who knows what the world in question might hold for us. As we were discussing what we would do in an Isekai Situation it happened and now we are here.. Where is here?

“Far be it for me to point out the obvious as that is usually John, well. Dycho’s Job but um. We clearly are not in my kitchen anymore.” Jordan Also known as Dante Said. “No shit Sherlock” Shane Also Known as Draven  replied. “The fuck you mean i point out the obvious? Do we seriously have time right now for cheap shot jokes, As you so eloquently point out we are not in your kitchen. So where the hell are we? How the hell did we get here? We are outside in… What a forest? A cliff face? It wouldn’t kill you to take things seriously from time to time you Skank waffling Twat biscuit” Dycho said with increasing intensity till he was yelling. Dante and Draven looked at each other and then Dycho. “That was a Stellar Insult, Have you been practicing or something?” Dante said with a laugh. 

“Don’t get me wrong, I’m freaked out too. You know that i joke when i'm stressed out though” Dante said Draven looked around “Well we are outside, That's certainly something if you two sissies are done kissing could we focus a bit?” Draven said  Bringing the pain that only his quick wit and charisma could. Though clearly he was off put by their situation he was a champ at hiding it behind his Naturally calm persona and a bag of green. “ Let's think rationally first. A quote I can think of is: If you eliminate all things that are possible then the answer is what's left or something like that.” Dante said and took a breath. 

“What are we gonna do, What can we do?” Dante asked and plopped down onto a nearby rock. Skillet and tongs still in hand. A shudder went down his spine, Well that was interesting though, Even though it had been Coldish outside it felt hot out. “Did anyone else notice that it is pretty hot?” Dycho said, calming down a bit. “Now that you mention it yea” Draven said pulling off his hoodie. And tying it around his waist after briefly setting down the items in his hands but picking them back up. “All i can think is that i'm hungry, I feel like an anime protagonist” Dante Jokes while flipping the steaks in the skillet with the tongs. 

“Seriously, we need to come up with something concrete here. In case you two hadn’t noticed Not only did our location and the weather change, the time of day changed. It was evening but it doesn’t even seem like it's noon now. I don’t think either of you appreciate the gravity of those implications” Dycho said, trying to reason with them which he should have learned by now was useless. They all had known each other a long time after all going on 14 ½  years in fact at the time of this writing. 

“Don’t shit yourself old man, Jesus(en espanol). We get it, We are in serious trouble. There's a million thoughts racing through my head right now I can hardly even focus on what's happened let alone a solution .” Dante responded with a troubled, almost weak laugh. “Yeah I getcha, Just. Dammit. What the hell. Are we even on earth now? Is this what your place looked like in the past or will look like in the future? Are we on another planet entirely? If so, what does that mean for my family, you know?” Dycho Said. Dante and Draven gave each other another look As if affirming in each other's minds what Dycho Must be feeling, The two of them didn’t have much of an anchor in their world after all. 

Dycho, on the other hand, had a family. A wife and kids, a dog Mumu and the best cat in the whole universe. Pewter.  Let's face it, the most important part in The minds of the others was the dog and cat. They were simple folk with simple needs.

* The first brandcoin combining both IRL efforts and social media efforts
* IRL efforts are unprecedented, nothing has been done on this scale ever before
* Social media efforts are extremely strong
* Over 18k holders
* 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik Votes, only other coin to reach this was Pepe
* HHI score < 27
* ATH of 283 million
* Telegram message count is higher than SPX, GIGA and MOG over extended periods of time

**Why is Kendu Combining Both IRL and Social Media**

The days of social media efforts being enough are over, back in the day Shib and Doge changed the game forever, they set a new standard. Now a new level has to be reached... a way to reach a new level is through IRL efforts. In a world full of bots and unfortunately rampant AI usage, Kendu shows **Proof of Humanity**

**Kendu's Social Media Efforts**

* X efforts that rival the very best, I unfortunately cannot say that Kendu has the strongest X community simply because idk how you would measure it and I don't wanna make false statements
* Reddit efforts are simply number 1, check any crypto subreddit and you will see Kendu with far more posts and more engagement than any other coin, with also a very large subreddit
* Stocktwits, Kendu is number 1 by far, we have an insane presence and routinely win competitions
* Recently won CMC's BOOST ME COMPETITION and was one of the only projects to use no AI
* In MaestroBot's 250k Battle Royale, competing against 31 other projects on BASE
* We have TikTok efforts that are ramping up marking a new effort
* We also have an Instagram presence which gathers lots of interest from non holders

**Kendu's IRL Efforts**

* Kendu Coffee
* Kendu Energy
* Kendu Merch
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation 
* Kendu Board Game
* Kendu Creator
* Kendu Jewellery

* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu
* Kendu Press 
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers
* Kendu Spice
* Kendu Radio Show

**Final Thoughts and Summary**

Kendu is doing things that no other project is doing all at around 10 million market cap which is insane. Shib 1000x in 36 days back in 2021 and it is very possible for another project to do this. Kendu has the biggest potential to be this project, Kendu is outworking coins in the hundreds of millions and even the billions in a space where community is everything...well the results will be clear. This is NFA but in my opinion **Kendu will be the next 1000x.** In terms of price action only imo **Kendu is the next Shib or the next Doge or the next Pepe.**

The results will be simple, all the signs are there

1nswa8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1nswa8c/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_for_offices_with/,Explore the Best Coffee Maker for Offices with Keurig K1500 Review,"Testing out the Keurig K1500 coffee maker over the past month has been a caffeinated adventure in convenience and versatility. This slick machine, designed especially for small offices or home use, quickly became a centerpiece in my kitchen. The build, features, and functionality all contribute to making this one seriously impressive coffee maker. However, it certainly isn’t without a few quirks. Let’s dive in.

**Design and Usability**  
The sleek black exterior of the Keurig K1500 feels modern yet understated, blending effortlessly with my kitchen appliances. At 12.4 inches wide, it doesn’t dominate the countertop but still packs a punch in functionality. Buttons on the interface are clear and straightforward, so even my friend—who prides himself on being technologically challenged—could operate it without hesitation. The extra-large 96-ounce water reservoir is an absolute lifesaver. I found myself brewing cup after cup without constantly refilling it, making it one of the most practical aspects for busy mornings or office-wide java runs. Cleaning this tank with its handy detachable handle was also surprisingly effortless, a feature I didn’t fully appreciate until I spilled water cleaning older models in the past.

**Coffee Customization Options**  
If you’re someone who loves options, this coffee maker delivers. It offers four cup sizes (6 oz., 8 oz., 10 oz., and 12 oz.), ensuring you can brew just enough whether you’re craving a quick shot of caffeine or need a full mug to power through your afternoon. The Strong button is a game-changer, delivering a bolder flavor without turning your coffee bitter. While testing this feature, I brewed a cup of Sumatra roast, and the taste had that perfect level of richness I usually only expect from pricier machines.

**Perks**  
- The STRONG button adds a richer, more vivid coffee flavor.  
- Large 96-ounce reservoir reduces the need for frequent refills.  
- Quiet Brew Technology minimizes noise, great for early mornings.  
- Intuitive design makes it easy for anyone to operate.  

[Check Keurig K1500 price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b07m67x3gn/)  

**Performance and Noise**  
What impressed me equally was how silent this machine operates. The Quiet Brew Technology ensures you’re not making a racket during brewing sessions, so getting my first cup at 6 AM no longer feels like I’m waking the entire block. The speed is stellar too—most cups were ready in under a minute, whether I was using a reusable filter pod or the single-serve K-Cups.

**Downsides**  
- It’s not the lightest machine, so moving it isn’t ideal.  
- While versatile, it’s built for K-Cups, which can be pricier over time compared to ground coffee.  
- The water level indicator is sometimes tricky to see unless you’re looking directly at it.  

**Other Options**  
Comparing the Keurig K1500 to other brands like the Nespresso Pixie or even manual drip coffee makers leads to some interesting takeaways. The Keurig absolutely wins for speed and user-friendly operation; I’ve tested Nespresso models that required more fiddling, even with capsules. However, if you’re a fan of the frothy espresso layer, Nespresso machines might have an edge. Old-school manual drips are great for a rich flavor profile but cannot match the unmatched convenience of popping in a K-Cup and pressing a button here. Ultimately, the Keurig wins in versatility with its multiple cup sizes and bold brew function.

**Bang for the Buck**  
The Keurig K1500 has earned its spot on my counter for its blend of functionality and style. While definitely an investment compared to basic models, the value it brings with its robust features makes it worth the price tag. You’re getting durability, high-speed brewing, and premium customization options. Comparing it to office-grade machines I’ve seen in coworking spaces, this one holds up remarkably well. If you’re someone who appreciates quality coffee consistently and easily, it’s an excellent pick.

Mick: Yes that’s what dog owners do they own dogs do you have a problem with my babies?

Matthew: First of all anyone who calls their dog their babies has mental issues and second all they sit, they sniff, they lick, they drool, Mick they have parasites

Mick: telling me not to own a dog as a dog person is like telling a fish not to swim in water. It’s just against my nature.

Bryson: Mick you literally dreamed of having dogs multiple times in a row and that’s what scares us the most 

Mick: F#!k you guys and also I thought you said Pony likes dogs so he wouldn’t have a problem when he comes over for the studio session later today

Matthew: I did say that, but Dally’s dog Poofles was different at least she wasn’t the size of a bear cub

1nsw7n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1nsw7n5/surgery_or_not/,Surgery or not?,"April 2024, I ended up in hospital with an Infected  galladder and plummeting blood pressure. 
I was very sick and on a lot of morphine and antibiotics.
I remember being told after the scan that I had stones, and that I would need my gallbladder removed.
NHS being the NHS though, I was sent home to await a call and was told it would be over 10 months wait unless I ended up in hospital again.

Anyway, fast forward 18 months, I had the pre surgery appointment (July '24) and since then, nothing.

The thing is though, I'm not sure I want the surgery now.
Originally I did, I'd been having symptoms for years without knowing, bloating, pain etc, but since last summer, I've been symptom free.
I switched my diet about, and the biggest change was giving up coffee (I was a 3 cup a day girl).
I hadn't realised how uncomfortable coffee made me until I started drinking it again the middle of last year and all my symptoms came back.

Could my stones have not been so bad after all? Or at least aren't agitated by coffee?

I can't see that I'll get another scan, but I'm not sure where to go from here.",1,1759085300.0,gallbladders,2,1.0,False

He asked me to move in. I started having strokes that weren’t diagnosed for 5 years (despite being an ER nurse in a Level 1 Trauma Center. My personality changed, he threw me out. We’ve had a difficult time separating although he is on his 2nd gf since me. He’s my True North. This year the fog and confusion I existed in finally lifted, I’ve been able to get some help for my residual invisible deficits. He moved to the state my sis lives in (NC). The sis I visit every few months, the same state I am considering moving to. The gf is a childhood sweetheart, lives in Chicago, will not leave for 9 years, cannot handle some intrinsic things about him so he hides them. I have not had perfect behavior (not stalking or anything like that; maybe over-communicating at worst). He is very angry at me, blocks and unblocks me. I am going there in a couple weeks. I KNOW if he spent some time w me and got to know me again he’d fall in love. He has said he’d “be too tempted” to see me. But I know seeing me in person would rekindle feelings. How do I respect his boundaries and somehow get him to meet me for coffee? Any ideas? I have been No Contact for 3 weeks at a time over the past few months and acted maturely.

I’m the one who broke it off because it was toxic and I was the one causing a lot of issues. I needed (and still need) to work on myself and get my shit together bc I was in a bad place mentally. I’ve been really spiraling the past few years and I can’t continue to do that to her. We were a situationship, not really together but were in a way, for about 8 months.

However 2 months ago I officially told her we need to stop because I finally came to the realization I needed to be better and I wasn’t healing myself for her, just avoiding the issues. I couldn’t keep doing that to her. 1 month ago she officially blocked me on everything, only days after she made a post saying she didn’t know how to let me go (on a burner account we both had exclusively for each other, neither of us following anyone else). Noticing she blocked me made my stomach churn. 

I knew she would move on bc I told her to, and realistically I should be happy for her to find someone who’s going to treat her right.

But I accidentally ran into her holding someone else’s hand at a coffee shop and I have been in a downward spiral, right back to where I was the night I told her to let go. We didn’t speak. I was looking down at my phone and looked up to see her walking past me, holding someone’s hand, very clearly avoiding my eye contact. I guess healing isn’t linear but man that was jarring. It’s so hard when you know it’s the right thing for both of you to let go but you don’t want to let go. ",1,1759085027.0,ExNoContact,2,0.99,False

I’m a 27-year-old girl living in Colombo, and honestly, I don’t have any close friends here. My best friend recently moved abroad, and I really miss having someone to go out with. I’d love to find a genuine girl friend in Colombo…someone I can grab coffee with, go shopping, have fun chit-chats and girl talks, and just enjoy spending time together.

My office colleagues are nice, but they don’t really go out, and I’m really craving that “girl time” with a friend.

Hey folks,  
I’ve been tinkering with a long-form isekai/progression fantasy idea and wanted to test the waters. This is the prologue (working title still TBD).

The vibe:

* Trio of friends accidentally thrown into another world, with no legend, No hero summon. Just Wild magic doing whatever it wants to 3 mid 30's Out of shape friends.
* Guild systems, Classes, and Guild branches shaped by ancient precursor tech.
* A world where *everyone* has limits — except our protagonists, whose show “Limit Error.”
* RPG systems, heavy world building, progression from rock-bottom (literally level 0) into the unknown. Some notable talents and skills, that they do not know how to use.

I’d love to know:

* Does the prologue hook you?
* Would you keep reading?

Here’s the prologue:

The Prologue: Getting To Know The Situation.

This isn’t like that though the homies and me together again. That’s the good stuff that doesn’t come around as often as we like and that does indeed make it a special day. So on this special day we are chilling in the kitchen on a regular Monday evening. I’m cooking meat, as one does when the homies are over. 

Shane is making coffee because he's an addict. And cheesy mashed potatoes as he is skilled in. John is recounting a video he saw about a popular game that's coming out that he thinks we will like, we know each other pretty well and he's always got his ear to the ground for that type of thing as where i avoid that type of hype purposely and Shane while he knows typically doesn’t dish too much. He will throw out a name or type of game here and there but mostly it's in John's hands to dish the details. 

But it's a delicate balance, It works for us. After this conversation subsides I bring up the topic of Isekai Anime. I've been watching a lot of them lately and I’ve got it in my head that I want to write one of my own. Featuring the 3 of us of course because what if 3 bros got transported to a new world instead of either 1 super powered player/entity/dude/girl or a bunch of randos expected to work together to thwart some great disaster with no real teamwork. Which I mean, each story has its charms and its in’s and out's, its unique features, its different levels of comparability to our own world. 

Obviously I like them enough to theorize my own version and put in the time and effort to world building right? Easily I was able to come up with possible classes for the two of them and some approximate stats, We all know Shane is Maxed out charisma stat, and Constitution stat with ambiguous other stats related to magic casting, he's always been the most knowledgeable in Tabletop games, Role Plays and Stories about magic so he was obviously the solid choice for our Caster, though with his high Tank stats it would certainly throw any for a loop in a magical Fantasy world For him to be the Mage. 

John on the other hand, me and him play role play games together sometimes, I’m a better talker and he’s a better stealth/risk management person so In my view, moral Implications aside he would be a solid choice for a Rogue esque character though he typically plays undead in one of our favorite replay games. So I joked that he would be our rogue Lich. He was like “I'd feel kinda weird being the only undead” so I got a laugh out of it regardless. He's definitely our Dexterity stat and strategy guy, though when it came to table tops, Shane was always 3 steps ahead. I often joke that he's too good at them. That leaves me to the point that I really had to figure out what i would be… and as typical With a wealth of knowledge and observation for others. No idea what I would even do. 

While I usually play a healer/support in Video Games, that would leave the front line with much to be desired. Though Shane could tank it wouldn’t make him a very effective magic caster if like in some games spell casting could be interrupted by attacks. Though, hadn’t even thought of that till now so Who knows what the world in question might hold for us. As we were discussing what we would do in an Isekai Situation it happened and now we are here.. Where is here?

“Far be it for me to point out the obvious as that is usually John, well. Dycho’s Job but um. We clearly are not in my kitchen anymore.” Jordan Also known as Dante Said. “No shit Sherlock” Shane Also Known as Draven  replied. “The fuck you mean i point out the obvious? Do we seriously have time right now for cheap shot jokes, As you so eloquently point out we are not in your kitchen. So where the hell are we? How the hell did we get here? We are outside in… What a forest? A cliff face? It wouldn’t kill you to take things seriously from time to time you Skank waffling Twat biscuit” Dycho said with increasing intensity till he was yelling. Dante and Draven looked at each other and then Dycho. “That was a Stellar Insult, Have you been practicing or something?” Dante said with a laugh. 

“Don’t get me wrong, I’m freaked out too. You know that i joke when i'm stressed out though” Dante said Draven looked around “Well we are outside, That's certainly something if you two sissies are done kissing could we focus a bit?” Draven said  Bringing the pain that only his quick wit and charisma could. Though clearly he was off put by their situation he was a champ at hiding it behind his Naturally calm persona and a bag of green. “ Let's think rationally first. A quote I can think of is: If you eliminate all things that are possible then the answer is what's left or something like that.” Dante said and took a breath. 

“What are we gonna do, What can we do?” Dante asked and plopped down onto a nearby rock. Skillet and tongs still in hand. A shudder went down his spine, Well that was interesting though, Even though it had been Coldish outside it felt hot out. “Did anyone else notice that it is pretty hot?” Dycho said, calming down a bit. “Now that you mention it yea” Draven said pulling off his hoodie. And tying it around his waist after briefly setting down the items in his hands but picking them back up. “All i can think is that i'm hungry, I feel like an anime protagonist” Dante Jokes while flipping the steaks in the skillet with the tongs. 

“Seriously, we need to come up with something concrete here. In case you two hadn’t noticed Not only did our location and the weather change, the time of day changed. It was evening but it doesn’t even seem like it's noon now. I don’t think either of you appreciate the gravity of those implications” Dycho said, trying to reason with them which he should have learned by now was useless. They all had known each other a long time after all going on 14 ½  years in fact at the time of this writing. 

“Don’t shit yourself old man, Jesus(en espanol). We get it, We are in serious trouble. There's a million thoughts racing through my head right now I can hardly even focus on what's happened let alone a solution .” Dante responded with a troubled, almost weak laugh. “Yeah I getcha, Just. Dammit. What the hell. Are we even on earth now? Is this what your place looked like in the past or will look like in the future? Are we on another planet entirely? If so, what does that mean for my family, you know?” Dycho Said. Dante and Draven gave each other another look As if affirming in each other's minds what Dycho Must be feeling, The two of them didn’t have much of an anchor in their world after all. 

Dycho, on the other hand, had a family. A wife and kids, a dog Mumu and the best cat in the whole universe. Pewter.  Let's face it, the most important part in The minds of the others was the dog and cat. They were simple folk with simple needs.

1nsw12x,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1nsw12x/which_do_you_find_more_comfortable_when_taking/,Which do you find more comfortable when taking out coffee — a tray or a carrier?,"
When I buy several drinks at a café, I often feel uncomfortable using a tray. Since it has no handle, it feels unstable and sometimes I almost spill the drinks 😅. Personally, I think a carrier is much more convenient than a tray.

For context, I’m from Korea but currently in Canada. In Korea, we often use carriers with handles, but here in Canada, trays are more common. I’m not sure about other countries, but it made me wonder — why do people mainly use trays instead of carriers? Maybe it’s because of cultural differences, cost, or even regulations.

I’m curious if it’s different where you live. Do you guys use trays, carriers, or something else? And which one do you find more convenient?

We didn't have much in common. I was on entry level position. The company had around 700 people hired locally. And he was the top guy. We heard stories of him being very harsh and uptight, strict, mean. I had a weird crush on him even though I saw him just once face to face (Closely) - at the office coffee shop. He was very tall, had a button down shirt, short hair, blue icy eyes that were so cold and a pretty nice built.

Only a few years later I had my first interaction with him and it happened in a meeting via Teams. he made me feel bad about a mistake my colleague did, but he didn't care and just took it all out on me, raised his voice, talked down to me, asked me questions like: are you capable to at least follow what I am telling you?"" I felt so bad and ashamed. He didn't allow me to speak, he kept cutting me off with mean remarks. Finally I resigned, but not because of this, unrelated reasons.

Now I am 30 and he is 46 and we met randomly at a local event. He didn't remember me but when I told him my name he was like: you that girl that told me to watch my tone (he was friendly). I said, yeah. We kept talking for another 20 minutes. Then he invited me for a drink at the bar. He said he remembers the incident and said he feels very sorry for it. Managerial positions are very stressful and sometimes he loses his temper but is working on it to happen less often. I ended up at his place and we had sex. I didn't spend the night.

I asked the next day a woman who works there if he has changed since then (I didn' tell her what happened) and she said he is even worse. So he didn't probably say the truth. Well, but now I keep thinking about this. He did not ask for a contact detail from me so I guess he doesn't want to hear of me anymore. Would it be too much if I followed him on Linked in? He is divorced btw for a very long time",36,1759084709.0,TrueOffMyChest,23,0.74,False
1nsvybu,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1nsvybu/should_i_tell_my_best_friend_that_i_love_her/,Should I tell my best friend that I love her,"Me and my dearest friend met a couple of years ago while we were working for the same client. We are both musicians. She was hired as the back up vocalist while I was playing guitar. We didnt really become friends right away but a couple of beers back stage and hotels got us to hook up a couple of times.
This led us to hook up pretty much everytime we ended up playing for that same client over the years but we never became close and rarely held contact outside of work.

However, about a year and a bit ago she texted me asking if we should get a coffee sometime and ofcourse I assumed that she wanted to hook up again. Later that week we met at a café and it was honestly pretty wierd because we barely knew each other really and I was just thinking ""when are we heading back to her place?"". But we never did. She just wanted to get to know me as a person which left me pretty flattered.

We went for more and more coffees, beers, nights out, camping trips and what not together without just sleeping with eachother, even though it still happened from time to time. We texted and called everyday and I could tell that she really cared about me on a deeper level. She really saw me for me, and the same goes for me with her of course.
By the end of the year we had grown so tight that I was spending more time with her than not. We truely became best friends.

About 7 months ago I moved to a different continent and we were both sad when I had to leave because we didnt know when we would meet again. During the following months I noticed that I just couldnt shake her from my mind. I missed her so much even though we held in touch every day.

A couple of weeks ago I had the oppertunity to visit home again. The same day I booked my ticket she and I had a call where she was telling me how much she misses me. So I decided not to tell her that I was coming back just to surprise her (and the day I was arriving was coincidentally on her birthday).

When we met again it was like no time had passed at all. We were both so happy to see eachother again. But after some time apart I feel like something changed. We were way more touchy-feely with one another, cuddling up more often and generally more ""couple like"".

But yesterday when we were hanging out she got a call from a guy that she had been sleeping with and they decided to meet up that same night. She and I have both been open about our sexlife and the people we've been seeing since we werent a couple and I've never had a problem with it. Until yesterday. 

I felt myself getting washed away in a big wave of jealousy and the night turned pretty sour. On my walk back home I realized that I don't see her just as a friend anymore. I have feelings for her. And to keep the connection betweend her and I I have to be honest with myself and her.

I want to tell her, but I am so scared to make things wierd or even ruining things for ever.
She means the world to me, but Ive realized that I just cant pretend its not happening, for both our sakes.

	•	Shoulder-season tips so evenings aren’t miserable?
	•	If not mountains, what’s your favorite fall “reset” road trip in Europe?

There are no leaks as far as we're concerned, all hoses are tight and snug, new coolant while we were at it too. It cools just fine, fans are going,

Took it to its first long drive last month after mainly being used to commute to work and back (30 minutes to a nearby town and back for an hour total drive time) and the gauge started overheating jumping pretty quickly to the top. There was no coolant so I left it in the town and took it back after refilling and it did just fine coming back home. Yesterday took it for another one again, this time into downtown to visit a couple places and back, started doing the same thing except this time there was coolant in the reservoir. I'm stumped because why does this only happen when it's driven for a nonstop 30+ minute drive but never when it's under that drive time? Oil fill hole does not have a sweet scent after a couple whiffs (I like my coffee smelling like thick and burnt oil with no other smell, also carcinogenic too) so I'm even more surprised the block or head didn't warp, seems to drive completely fine without any symptoms that would come from a blown gasket, like the exhaust or a change in oil color. 

I noticed that right before it starts jumping up, the needle goes somewhat crazy, going above and below the temperature icon a couple times before finally going up fast.

Sometimes she just sits on the porch early in the morning talking to her friends about her baby daddy and how much he ain’t this or that and what he does in his personal life. And she wants me to sit and have morning coffee with her. I don’t want to start my day hearing about her baby daddy. 

For example, we were talking about going to Coachella one day and how it would be fun. She starts ranting about how her baby daddy got to go and she was so pissed off. I wasn’t sure how he was relevant to me and her having an experience together? 

Another example, she asked me how an outfit looked one time before we stepped out. She then goes on to say her baby daddy would have never let her wear something like that in the past. What was the relevance in bringing that up? 

Another example, we’re just waking up and she starts telling me about how her brother has her baby daddy on snap chat and he got a tattoo of some girls name on his forearm and the girl he’s with got his name too. She had her brother send him the snap chat of him and the girls tattoo and shows it to me too. 
Why do we care if this man gets a tattoo? 
I don’t care to know about his personal life as that has nothing to do with their child together.

The next day after the Snapchat incident. We’re at home on the couch and I was having some horrible pain but we wanted lunch so I asked her if she would go and pick up some food and I’ll pay. Usually   I do the driving or picking up food and ordering etc. she gets upset with me and blows up and says why does she have to go get lunch because I don’t feel good that I make her to do stuff all the time when she doesn’t feel good. And honestly that baffled me because I’m the man in the relationship and carry myself as such and I do things for her and her daughter all the time. I usually do all the cooking and food buying. Not sure where that was coming from but I didn’t want lunch anymore. She apologizes and says she was wrong. 

I think she was in her feelings about her baby daddy and lashed out at me let me know what your thoughts are.

Am I Overreacting?","I’ve been at my job for three months, and it’s my first job. My first leader was someone I thought was fantastic from the beginning. I really admire him professionally, and over time we developed a very good interaction.

However, lately I’ve noticed that my feelings for him might go beyond professional admiration. I’d like to get your opinion: do you think he might feel something for me beyond a professional relationship?

I admire him for being highly skilled, for his position, the courses he has taken, the languages he speaks, and his knowledge of sign language. I find all of that amazing. He always greets me, even though he’s no longer my direct leader, but he’s still a senior leader and in some ways still acts as my leader.

When he stopped being my direct leader, I even mentioned that I still wanted to move to his department. He told me that he likes me a lot and hopes to work with me again. In fact, he even tried to bring me to his department again, but my current leader didn’t allow it.

Recently, my mother passed away, and he showed concern for me—he hugged me, asked how I was doing, and even sent messages on WhatsApp. He also checks my WhatsApp status. During a feedback session, one of our first formal conversations, he even got coffee for me while we talked in the administrative area.

Our interaction is very positive: he has talked about me to a colleague, often says that he likes me and cares about me, tends to look at me when I pass through the department, and always protects me. In fact, there were about four or five times when I was close to being fired, but he didn’t allow it.

We just finished painting our master bedroom a deep navy blue. Our guest bathroom is chocolate brown. And we plan to paint an accent wall or two in the living room/kitchen area in a deeper, earthy green. I would like the neutral tone we use to tie everything together.

The current color we have is an ugly beige/sand color that the entire house was painted in when we moved in. I was leaning towards Benjamin Moore's Revere Pewter, but also considering BM Swiss Coffee for more of a light/off-white tone. Revere Pewter is my top choice right now because our hallway doesn't get a lot of natural light, but our living room and kitchen area does. It sounds like this color is pretty adaptable, but please tell me if I'm way off base.

So I decided to make them myself. I’m not a carpenter, just someone who wanted their kitchen to feel warm and personal. What surprised me was how much fun the process turned out to be.

The first thing I learned was how much the wood itself matters. I thought wood was just wood, but pine, oak, reclaimed barn boards—they all change the look. I went with reclaimed planks, and the knots and imperfections actually became my favorite feature. It gave the shelves that lived-in vibe you just can’t buy from a store.

Finishing was another big “aha” moment. A simple sand, stain, and seal transformed the boards completely. I even tried lightly distressing the edges, which made brand-new pine look like it had been in an old farmhouse for decades. The key for me was not going overboard—subtle touches made it feel authentic rather than “Pinterest-overdone.”

Then came the hardware. Honestly, this step made or broke the project. I used black iron brackets, leveled everything carefully, and anchored into studs. Suddenly, my shelves didn’t just look nice—they looked solid and intentional. And the bonus? Black brackets hide smudges and tie in perfectly with kitchen appliances.

Now that they’re up, styling them is half the fun. Mixing everyday dishes with jars, cutting boards, and a bit of greenery made the space cozy but uncluttered. I love that I can swap things around seasonally too—pumpkins in fall, herbs in spring. It’s like free redecorating every few months.

Honestly, this was one of my favorite DIY projects yet. The shelves cost way less than buying pre-made, and every time I walk into the kitchen I get a little jolt of pride. If you want the full step-by-step I followed, I wrote it all up here: [https://myreviews25.com/diy-rustic-shelves-for-a-farmhouse-kitchen-youll-want-to-brag-about/](https://myreviews25.com/diy-rustic-shelves-for-a-farmhouse-kitchen-youll-want-to-brag-about/)

Basically my gf has a 5 year old and she split from the baby’s father at age 1. Baby daddy is 26M. They don’t hang out or see eachtother because the father is quite absent.

He was just stern. Even safe - like he won't hurt me but you can't negotiate your way out of trouble, he was there to help me come to terms with it. Dream that felt more like me in another, parallel reality starts with me having to repeat a surgery on my nose (I had deviated septum surgery irl and I'm constantly struggling with my sinuses, genuinely wondering do I need to repay a visit) . I was absolutely resisting, vocally protesting and trying to wiggle out but I was put under without my permission. Sure enough, under medical instruments and wires and whatnot put on my body and strapped to bed... I couldn't move or say anything, my family was there basically mourning me.

Somehow I find myself at the two places at the same time - so there at hospital, confined and paralyzed, and in my living room. Obviously I'm trying to escape now from this new point of view bc idk what to do else. At one point I did escape house and flew into sky but just couldn't fly past the certain point above my small town. So I went back to the living room. At certain point being manifests, I have no idea what he looked like at first - maybe just like a human or humanlike at least. In the dreams I remembered his every word and hold onto it tight. He was giving me lecture and knowledge. After awhile we decide to sit on a couch and that's were his 'real' self finally shows - very stereotypically brownish-grey reptilianlike-gargolylish looking creature but its his eyes that I remember the most. Rounded eyes, far apart, with extremely pinstripey irises (basically just like the one in a reptile be it snake or a lizard... but with awareness of a higher intelligence, just like in us humans) . I literally tell him (and honestly, that's all I remember between words spoken back and forth) - 'can you switch back, your eyes are scary' he didn't budge, barely even acknowledged the request, so I either thought or said back 'I guess not' and left it there. He vanished. 

Very delicious looking pizza manifests on coffee table and idk why but it tempted me and I started eating it. It was hard to swallow bc I had tubes in my throat in hospital if that makes sense. People start coming in my house and bothering me via invasion of privacy and I start snarking back at them. I gets me so frustrated and flustered that I suddenly remember and seethingly snark under my breath 'I was supposed to get a cat'. And just like that, woosh, I'm back on the surface, in this current life, in bed, it's like 5-6am. All that I've remembered from the very waking moment was HIS EYES and nothing else. His eyes were practically pulsating in my mind. He was technically very intimidating looking and definitely intriguing but he didn't give me anything beyond being there as a teacher, mentor or a spirit guide. I wasn't even that much scared like one should be screaming at top of the lungs at the sight of this behemoth... I was acquainted with him immediately although he wasn't most softest or warmest guest.

Of course, I was very mad that none word he shared with me didn't stuck - like whyyy? What was the point??? All the other scenes happening from this 'dream' (felt as real as real life and lucid) started coming together secondarily...

Nico complaining that it was too hot in bed already, but secretly he loves it. 

2. Will's mom, while Will was at camp, developed a drug addiction while on tour. She probably misses Will a HECK of a lot since he's a year-rounder; imagine not being able to even hug your child for years. She also might be very stressed with her tour schedules, having to constantly sing in front of millions of people with very little breaks. So I think she might have turned to drugs as a way to cope. Imagine how guilty and heartbroken Will would be if he found out😭

3. Will has a habit of shaking his wrists when overwhelmed, excited, or scared. It's probably a way to stimulate himself, and we know he's insanely ADHD coded already. Also I think he would have been taught to oppress the urge to shake his wrists because it might've looked strange, and Will taking that super personally and only doing it in public when he meets Nico and learns he finds it incredibly endearing whenever he shakes his wrists, and will often encourage him to do so if he's particularly overwhelmed with work.

4. No, but think about this. SOLANGELO + ANIMAL CROSSING. Like, Nico would totally only play the game because Will begged him to, and would spend all his time angering his villagers just to watch them stomp around, or make conspiracy theories about Tom Nook being a tanuki reincarnation of Kim Jong Un.

Background:  
Cucumber and lemon made me think of culinary applications right away, and the one I settled on was gazpacho.  We had a bumper crop of tomatoes this summer, and there's still some out in the garden, so I felt like playing with drinks that utilized what we had growing.  I wanted to have all of the flavors of gazpacho in there, the tomato, cucumber, onion, lemon, and some element of pepper as well.  I often include leftover dried bread into my gazpacho so I wanted to get bread into the drink somehow, and tried infusing gin with panko.  I think ultimately it was a bit excessive, though the interplay of the starches leeched from the bread with the lemon juice did seem to give a nice foamy head, which was nice.  I went with two applications of lemon - juice as well as an expressed peel at the end.  Four applications of cucumber - syrup, muddled, cucumber and tomato water, and the garnish.  For the tomato I went with cucumber and tomato water, as well as a garnish.  For the onion I went with a charred onion vermouth instead of trying for any sort of raw onion application which I think would have been too hot and bracing.  This method added some nice complexity and a little bit of sweetness.  


The garnish of two chunks of cucumber and a poached tomato was to link up with the name, two dashes and a dot, which is itself a nod to the famous tiki drink called three dots and a dash.  I chose the name two dashes and a dot as ""--."" is the Morse code for G, which here stands for gazpacho.  


Recipe:  

Cucumber syrup 0.5 oz

Cucumber and tomato water 0.75 oz

Cucumber to muddle - 2 inches of a Persian cucumber, quartered

Rice wine vinegar - 1 tsp

White pepper - pinch

Lemon juice 0.75 oz

Charred onion Vermouth 0.5 oz

Panko crumb infused gin blend - 2 oz

Mezcal 0.5 oz

Saline solution 3 drops


For garnishing: 

One peel of lemon

Chili oil 3 drops 

Two chunks of cucumber

One oil poached cherry tomato


Method:

Muddle the cucumber with the lemon juice.  Add the remaining ingredients.  Shake with ice for 15-20 seconds.  Double strain into a chilled glass.  Express oil from a lemon peel, discard the peel.  Garnish with a skewer containing two chunks of cucumber and a poached cherry tomato.  Apply three drops of chili oil.  


Tasting notes:
Summer in a glass.  This is full of fresh tomato, cucumber, and sweet onion.  The background note of the bread is very softly hidden, but has a gentle sweetness.  There's cucumber throughout, with a nice sweetness balanced by the lemon and a little bit of straight acetic notes from the rice wine vinegar.  The chili oil breaks up along the way and gives a touch of heat as you work your way through the drink.  The fresh tomato water comes back at the finish for a bright refreshing reminder of summer.  This is absolutely lovely.  


Recipes for individual ingredients: 

Cucumber and tomato water -  in a blender add a chopped cucumber and about twice as much chopped tomatoes by volume.  Add a pinch of salt and a pinch of MSG.   Blend until everything has been broken down.  Strain through a few layers of cheese cloth for 24 hours in the fridge.  You can stir or move the pulp around every few hours, but let the water drip through, and try not to press or squeeze too much as you'll get it cloudy.  Refrigerate and use within a week.  



Panko Gin Blend - Gently toast about 1/8 cup of panko in a pan until it starts to pick up some golden brown color and begins to smell nice and toasty.   Add to a mason jar and add 9-10 ounces of gin.  I went with 3 ounces of Brokers and 6 ounces of Death's Door gin.  But you could use any single gin or blend of gins you like.   Let sit for 24 hours, then strain through a coffee filter or cheese cloth, wringing out any remaining liquid (you will lose some gin in this process).  



Cucumber syrup:  This is a ratio based syrup that works quite well with any amount of cucumber you've got handy.  Start by removing the ends and seeds and any possible blemishes on the skin, but the rest of the skin can stay on.  Then add half the weight in sugar, put in a container,  shake to combine and leave in the fridge for 24 hours, shaking anytime you happen past and open the fridge.  After 24 hours strain and bottle.  Syrup should keep a couple weeks in the fridge.  I prefer making slightly smaller batches more often to be on the safe side. 



Oil poached tomatoes - Bring neutral oil up to about 300F, and gently place ripe cherry tomatoes into the oil.  Poach for a minute or two until skin starts to wrinkle.  Remove from oil, refrigerate and use within a few days.  These are great on toasted sourdough, over fresh pasta, or as part of a charcuterie plate.  



Charred onion vermouth:
Save up any onion scraps (and skins if you want, but no stickers) you have in a zip top bag in the freezer.  When you've got enough to fill a sandwich bag or cover most of a sheet pan, you're ready to go.  Preheat the oven to 350F, then add the onion scraps.  Cook until the onion flesh starts to soften, then crank the temp up to 500F and let it go until the edges of all of the bits start to blacken.  You can go longer if you want more char flavor.  Add the onions to a mason jar and cover with dry vermouth.  Let infuse in the fridge for 24 hours.  Strain through a cheese cloth and refrigerate for up to a week or two.



Chili Oil
The one I make is adapted from the recipe from Made with Lau's father's recipe.  https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/homemade-chili-oil The original uses Sichuan chili flakes, but I have sort of a hybrid variation that uses Mexican chili peppers with the rest of the ingredients the same from the recipe, although I do up the oil to about 16 ounces total.   I use about 2-3 ounces of chili peppers, a mix of Arbol, Morita, and Puya.   I put them through a food processor until they are in small flakes.   I follow the recipe there pretty much as written, but with the additions of a tablespoon or so of Sichuan peppercorns and a teaspoon of MSG to the spice mix.  ",28,1759084151.0,cocktails,1,0.95,False

I feel like I've been anchored by things that I don't see others handicapped by, or at least not anymore, and some of them I don't understand myself.

I've been really sick for over a week now, stuck at our home I'd kill to leave behind if I had any other options. Being sick in general is its own trigger as well, not having any help or care. It's so hard to distract myself here, so I have too much time to stare at the sun and analyze. It's forced me to see many areas where I have made no progress whatsoever. 

Some things on this list of zero improvement include:

**Cleaning/Chores.** Doing dishes, cleaning up messes I've made, cleaning litter boxes, etc. Big or small, I cry every time. If you know what a depression nest is, welcome to my house. The house hasn't been clean since the first month (March) when people still checked up on me and offered to help. I've tried here and there, and it just hits me *hard* and makes me feel so alone. It's somewhat ironic since I've always had the lions share of the workload. There are very few exceptions in this regard. 

**Employment.** Not all of us were out of work when it happened like I was and still am. I can't even look at job listings or my own resume without breaking down. She was the one I'd always turn to for career help, too, so I know that's a factor. Even if I could make it over that hurdle, I don't know what I'm even capable of doing anymore, and I seriously doubt I could even hold a job anymore.

**Cooking and making coffee.** I cooked 99% of our meals, and I made espresso for us every morning. I have no energy or desire to prep or cook my own food, but I really can't make coffee for myself without inducing a panic attack. It was a morning ritual. I'd always wait until I heard her getting up and start pulling shots. Almost always I'd have hers ready right when she got downstairs, and there's a Pavlov effect now that's incredibly triggering.

**The bedroom.** Still can't do it. Tears and panic attacks within 30 seconds. I've been on the couch ever since, and I don't think I can sleep on a bed made for two anymore, even a completely different one. The empty space is intolerable. 

There are others I can't think of at the moment because I've been feverish for over a week now and my brain is kinda cooked. ""It doesn't get better, just different"" resonates more and more when there's so many things that never improve. ",6,1759083914.0,SuicideBereavement,0,1.0,False

Hey you! I’m a 37-year-old professional overthinker from Europe, armed with a PhD in sarcasm and a master's degree in memeology. I love my motorcycle more than I love most people (sorry, not sorry). When i'm not riding my motorcycle, i'm either traveling, gaming, or pretending I’m an extrovert with friends. 

I asked a librarian once if the library had any books on paranoia; she whispered, “They’re right behind you.”.... i hvn't visited a library eversince...🤣🤣🤣fuckthat! 

My life’s chaotic, but I’m here to embrace the chaos with laughter and questionable life decisions.

Quickfire Facts About Yours Truly:

🏍 Motorcycles are my therapy. Don’t ask me how many I’ve almost bought on impulse.

💪🏽 All my leftover energy gets released at the gym.

🎮 Board/video games champion. (Trash talk included for free.)

Pineapple on pizza is like that one quirky friend you didn't ask for it, but now the party's better because they're there. Plus, it’s fruit, so technically, it makes pizza a salad. You're welcome.....😌🤣

Then explain to me why the gusts only pick up when you’re carrying groceries, or walking across Whoop-Up Drive with a coffee in your hand.

The truth is simple: the Lethbridge wind is a government-issued alien treadmill. They’re stress-testing us for interstellar colonization by making us walk against invisible resistance. You thought you were just struggling to keep your hat on? Nope — you’re part of the hybrid endurance program.

Ever notice how the High Level Bridge hums when the wind hits it? That’s not steel vibrating, that’s a signal tower to the mothership. Henderson Lake? Perfectly round because it’s actually a landing pad for when Mark Carney checks in on the experiments.

So next time you’re leaning 45° into the breeze just to get downtown, remember: you’re not fighting weather. You’re in phase two of alien conditioning. If you can survive Lethbridge wind, you can sprint across Mars.
