This is getting posted on a throwaway account for privacy reasons. Sorry if this is long, Im kind of overwhelmed.

I(17F) decided to try out a new sport a few months ago. I came in pretty unathletic, with no experience, starting obviously too late. So I still dont know a lot of stuff and need to be taught like the other kids starting out, all a lot younger than me. In our training group theres two coaches: an unathorized 18 year old (who is only there for some practices and mainly just helps out the club) and a the main coach. This post is about the second one, which I will refer to as K from now.

I dont know K's age, it's somewhere between 25 and 35. I practically have no information about him, as we hadnt talked much besides the sport. But from the few months of knowing him I can kind of guess that he's  still living with his parents, doesnt have a gf, just him and his dog kind of guy. He works a boring job making coffee in a firm and does coaching part time. Different coaches that are around seem to have known him for a long time, and it looks like he gets along with them pretty good. Kids also like him. 

Theres two other girls in my group that sometimes notice when he says something weird/out of pocket, usually it's nothing dramatic, we just give eachother 'the look' and laugh about it later.

K lives in a village a few minutes from the town where our practices are. I only found this out a few days ago, when he tried to drive me home. Last practice he was asking me where I live and when does the next bus come. I live in a remote place and have to explain this quite often, so I didnt think much of it. Im in a bad commute situation, and have to wait 1.5 hours for the bus everyday.  He asked me whether I wanted a drive to the bus stop(a 30 minute walk). He drives other kids around town too, but that day no one needed a ride. I said yes.

We were getting near my bus stop, when he asked whether I wanted to get out there or in the shopping mall as he knew I had time till the bus comes. I dont even remember what I said, but he just ignored it and kept driving. I was saying something about the gift I was going to buy my mom in the mall just before. K became weirdly sad  asking whether I need to buy it now. At that moment I was alredy so confused as to how he could miss the stop I just answered his questions. He said he wanted to drive me home as he felt sorry for me. That its only 10 more minutes than his usual route. I explained I needed the gift know and we turned around and he got me to the mall. I was pretty sad about this situation, as It would really help me out if I could get home quicker but I just couldnt that day. He could tell, then promised me that 'I have the next ride reserved whenewher I want'.

At this point I was still not realizing how weird this situation and convo was. Then he said I have to send him the picture of the gift when I buy it. It was two plain mini cake forms. I honestly dont know why would anyone want to see a pic of that.

Then I got home and checked my phone. He messaged me on whatsapp(he got my number from our team group chat, we never chatted though) 'Hi u are probably at home an probably bought it alredy'. Thats translated from slovak, but sounds weird in both languages. 

I sent him the photo and he kept talking about how hes taking me next time, and what a good gift I have. It was so weird I just tried to be polite. Than 3 hours later, this man asks for my IG?

I replied still polite, maybe this is just a coach thing and he wants to have a contact on me. Which doesnt make sense cause he has the whatsapp. I checked if my friends from club follow him, and they do so I sent him the IG. He requested the follow which I tried to ignore the next day, hoping he would leave me alone. Mind u I replied to the text at 1 am and he followed me almost immeadiately. Then he sent me some emojis  probably hoping to strike the conversation which I ignored for half a day too, then just replied with a waving hand. 

Thank god he left me alone since. I told my parents about the drive that didnt happen, just mentioned it. They acted very suspicious and dont want me to get in a car with him. I didnt think about this much until then but now Im seriously getting scared. I also remembered how once my friend(shes in a different training group) who got me to the sport joked around me being careful, cause K will try to flirt with me. 

Oh and I checked how long it would take for him to get home if he really drove me. Its almost half an hour extra, so he was lying about that.

How do I get out of this? Honestly if it was anyone else Id think he was hitting on me. Anyone that read this pls respond, I dont know what to do. Or am I just overreacting? ",3,1745791430.0,whatdoIdo,2,1.0,False

1k9fmau,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1k9fmau/could_whirlpool_whelj1_central_water_filtration/,Could Whirlpool WHELJ1 Central Water Filtration System Deliver Cleaner Water? Honest Review,"Testing the **Whirlpool WHELJ1 Central Water Filtration System** daily in my home was an experience worth sharing. When I first set up this whole-home water filtration system, I was curious if it could live up to its promise of providing clean, sediment-free water without the hassle of constant filter replacement. Spoiler alert: it's not perfect, but it’s pretty impressive.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The system is compact yet solid, measuring around 13.44 inches in length, 10.13 inches in width, and standing tall at 33.75 inches. Despite its hefty weight of over 44 pounds, maneuvering it wasn’t too daunting because it’s built to last. The design is simple, clean, and functional—there’s no unnecessary bulk or overcomplication in appearance. It fits snug into a corner of my utility closet. My plumber mentioned that the system’s power cord and tank setup are well thought out, making it easy to integrate with existing plumbing.

**Ease of Installation**  
Let’s talk about installation—a big worry for someone who isn't a DIY wizard. Thankfully, the package includes a bypass valve, drain hose, clips, hose clamps, an adapter elbow, and a grommet. With these accessories and the clear instructional manual, the process was far less intimidating than I feared. Just ensure you have a 110V outlet nearby and enough tubing for connections. With minimal help from my neighbor, the system was up and running within two hours. If I managed this, I’d bet most people could too!

**Positives**  
Here’s where this filtration system shines:  

- It’s NSF-certified, meaning it effectively reduces contaminants like sediment, odor, and chlorine, making the water taste cleaner.  
- The built-in **Filter Sense Technology** automatically flushes the system every 14 days, so I don’t need to replace filters at all.  
- The 15-gallons-per-minute flow rate ensures water pressure remains steady, even when multiple faucets are in use.  
- It’s designed to reduce contaminants as small as 40 microns (half the size of a human hair).  

[Check Whirlpool WHELJ1 Central Water Filtration System price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0cthmx9my/)

**Performance in Daily Use**  
With this system in place, I noticed an immediate improvement in water quality. My family claimed that even their tea and coffee brewed better. Showering felt different; gone was the weird chlorine scent lingering in the air. Plus, my dishes in the dishwasher didn’t come out with that strange residue anymore. Essentially, it catered to all touchpoints where water was involved—kitchen, laundry, and bathrooms. The automated flushing feature also meant I never had to schedule a reminder for maintenance. Talk about convenience!  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite its benefits, there are a few pain points:  

- It’s on the heavier side, so moving it into place might need assistance.  
- While installation isn’t overly technical, not everyone is comfortable handling plumbing connections.  
- The filtration system only targets specific contaminants; if you’re looking for additional features like reverse osmosis, you’ll need supplementary equipment.  

**Other Options**  
Comparing it to competitors in the market, the Whirlpool WHELJ1 holds its own pretty well. For example, compared to Aquasana OptimH20, which includes reverse osmosis but is more expensive and requires professional installation, the Whirlpool model feels budget-friendlier with almost equal simplicity. Another rival is the GE Whole House Filtration System, which costs less but lacks automatic flushing and NSF certification. Overall, while the Whirlpool system isn’t the most feature-heavy, it offers a fantastic balance of quality, ease of use, and reliability.

**Value Proposition**  
Considering its automated maintenance, sediment reduction efficacy, and sturdiness, I’d call this system a smart investment. You don’t have to spend more on frequent filter replacements, which is a cost-saving feature on its own. While it’s not the cheapest filtration system out there, I think it strikes a good balance between affordability and functionality.

1k9flkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k9flkw/i_found_a_disturbing_dark_web_video_series_and/,"I found a disturbing dark web video series, and the star of the show looks exactly like me.","This happened almost a month ago, but it's only as of today that I had the wherewithal to start writing it all down. I want to share what happened to me as part vent and part precautionary tale, and so I hope you understand why I'm keeping the details vague. 

I'm 21F and about to graduate college. Since sophomore year, I've worked part-time as a barista at a coffee shop. Up until a few weeks ago, it was a great gig. I was well paid, I got free pastries, and many of my coworkers became close friends of mine. One of said coworkers is relevant to this story, and to protect her privacy, I'll refer to her as ""Lydia"" henceforth. 

Every once in a while, I would get hit on by a patron, but it never escalated beyond a few sometimes creepy comments. I had previously never felt unsafe at my workplace, especially with all of my coworkers and regulars around. That changed about a month ago, when this whole ordeal began. It was around 4 in the afternoon, a pretty quiet time for the cafe, and I was refilling the pastry display. All of a sudden, Lydia comes up to me and says, ""Hey, that guy at Table 10 has been staring at you for a really long time. Do you two know each other?""

I looked at the corner table and instantly saw the patron in question. He wasn't a regular and he was a lot older than our usual clientele, probably in his late fifties. He had large, light blue eyes and thick, worm-like lips. I expected him to look away after I spotted him, or maybe to give me a suggestive wink and smile. The patron did neither. Not only did he continue staring at me, but he did so with an expression of pure shock on his face. He looked as though he'd seen a ghost. After an awkward staring contest, he rose from his seat and approached the counter. 

Before I could do my usual spiel—""How was the drink, sir? Can I help you out with anything else today?""—the man said, ""Angelica?"" 

""That's not my name, sorry."" 

""Oh, right. It's only a stage name, then?"" His voice was soft and high-pitched, as if atrophied. I had no clue what he was talking about and told him as much, albeit in more polite terms. What followed was a brief but frustrating conversation; the man, seemingly convinced that I was someone else, kept asking me about a video series that he'd seen me in. Specifically, he was interested in commissioning me for a video. By the way he danced around the exact content of said videos, I had a feeling that he was alluding to pornography. 

At one point, he mentioned that name of what I presumed to be the platform he was watching these videos on. I obviously won't give the exact name here, but for the purposes of this account, I'll pseudonymize it as ""Doves"". 

After some more back and forth, I was starting to think that the guy wasn't completely alright in the head. It would explain his insistence and his generally strange demeanor. However, just as I was about to ask him to leave, the man suddenly went quiet, sighing as though collecting himself. After a moment, he gave me a wink. I remember his eyelids audibly clicking as they opened and shut. 

""You don't have to be nervous,"" he told me. ""I'm a fan of yours. Look."" He then took his phone out of his pocket, spent a minute searching for something, and then held the phone out to me. I don't know what got into me exactly—sheer curiosity, I guess—but I took the phone from his hands to look at the image he'd pulled up. 

On the greasy screen was a photo of a young woman in an empty white room. The lighting was harsh and flat, lending an uncanny effect to an already bizarre composition. The woman stood close enough to the camera that you could only see her body from the waist up. She held her arm out towards the camera, showing off what seemed to be a puncture wound on her forearm. There was a large bruise encircling the area, and the wound itself was clearly infected, caked with old blood and pus. I looked up from the arm to her face, and despite the strange lighting, I was shocked by how much it looked like my own. She had my eye color and shape, my nose, my jaw, even my freckles. I dropped the phone onto the counter with a gasp and the man scrambled to pick it up. 

""What the fuck is that? Where did you get this photo!?"" I shouted, losing all pretense of nonchalance. The cafe went quiet, customers looking over at us and a few of my coworkers stepping closer to me. Seeing this, the man scowled and began muttering under his breath. I only caught a few words: ""uppity bitch"" and ""good money"" among them. He exited the shop in a huff, leaving an untouched cup of coffee on the corner table. 

After he left, I took 15 in the break room to compose myself. The photograph of the woman burned in my mind's eye. This ""Angelica"" seriously could have been my long-lost identical twin. I pulled out my phone and did a preliminary search for ""Doves"", the website (at least I assumed it was a website) that the man had mentioned, but I saw nothing that looked like a content sharing platform. I resolved to do a more thorough investigation once I returned home and had access to a computer. I made it through the rest of my evening without further incident. 

I worked the closing shift that day: 2 to 10 at night. When at last my coworkers and I finished all of our closing tasks, I put on my coat and stepped out of the building. The moment I felt the cold air on my face, the thought of walking two blocks to my car made me sick with fear. Lydia walked me to my car, which I greatly appreciated. She's a good head shorter than me, but she carries, so I felt a hell of a lot safer braving the dark beside her.  When I reached my car, I checked the trunk and backseat. After assuring myself that there was no-one waiting for me inside, I bid my friend goodnight and we parted ways. 

I had plenty of time to reflect during my thirty minute drive home. Embarrassing as it is to admit, I was a former pageant kid. I competed for most of my childhood, at the behest of my former beauty-queen mother. As a teenager, my mom tried to get me into modelling. It never went anywhere, but the amount of times my parents made me sit for digitals gave me some long-term scopophobia. To this day, I don't have any public social media as a result. I think anyone would be disturbed if a stranger confronted them in the way my customer did me, but my background made the experience impossible to shrug off. I needed to figure out who the hell this ""Angelica"" woman was, even if I knew I might not like what I discovered. 

I got back to my apartment at around 10:30 at night and the first thing I did was grab a drink, hoping it would soothe my anxiety. Unfortunately, the alcohol seemed to have the complete opposite effect. Never before had I regretted living alone so much. The fact that I lived on the first floor of the apartment building, usually a great convenience, also seemed at that moment to be a point of vulnerability. I checked that all of my doors and windows were locked before settling into my desk to begin my research. 

When checking the lock on my bedroom window, I stole a glance outside at the street. My apartment building has no attached parking garage, so the streets outside are lined with cars at all hours of the day and night. I've become familiar with my neighbors cars to the point where I can recognize when one of them is missing. It's for this reason that I picked up on the unfamiliar  Cherokee XJ across the street. The dark blue car, which I initially mistook for my neighbor's Isuzu Trooper, blended in well with its surroundings despite being an unusual model. I don't think I would've noticed it at all had the events of the day not left me so paranoid. I didn't see anyone inside, and it wasn't as though there was anything I could do about it, so I just closed my shutters and focused on the task at hand. 

At 10:45, I sat down at my desk with nothing but a woman's name and what I believed to be the name of a website. For a full hour, I poked around on the web to no avail. I started off with searches like ""Angelica arm puncture wound video"" and ""Angelica arm white room doves"" and then tried more detailed queries. I searched around increasingly obscure forums dedicated to all manner of topics from body horror art to grotesque auto-portraiture photography. Several drinks later, it occurred to me that I might be conducting my investigation in the wrong place—more specifically, on the wrong layer of the web. I hadn't wanted to confront the notion previously, but there was a chance that Angelica was producing some kind of self-harm fetish content, and if that were the case, I wasn't sure how much I'd find about her content on the surface web. 

Since I don't want anyone reading this to go on to search for the website, I'm not going to get into the details of my search. I will say, though, that once I got onto Dread, it wasn't nearly as hard to find as I thought. By midnight, I had found what I was looking for. 

The website's homepage was minimalistic—white text on a pure black background. It had a heading, ""**DOV3S**"", and a subheading, ""**3 friends creating exclusive content with love**."" Beneath were three names that let me know I was in the right place:

**> angelica** 

**> mary**

**> adam**

I steeled myself and clicked on ""angelica"". This portion of the site was a single, sprawling page that seemed to scroll for miles. Up at the top was a message, supposedly written by the woman herself: 

**angelica. 8teen. durable. i <3 my fans!!**

**no longer accepting commissions.**

**price varies on a per-video, per-photoset basis.**

**click title for duration/thumbnail/price info**

**!!! VIDEOS BEFORE 1/14/23 DO NOT HAVE AUDIO !!!**

**!!! NO REFUNDS !!!** 

Beneath the introductory text was a subheading that read ""free sample"", and beneath that was an embedded video, two minutes in duration. 

I pressed play. The video buffered for a long while, then began. It faded from black into a familiar shot. In the same white room I'd seen in the customer's picture, there she stood. She—""Angelica""—looked *awful*, far worse that she'd looked in the photograph. Her jaw clenched and unclenched strangely and her eyes were wide and darting, like a wild animal's. There was a giant, half-healed gash in her cheek and her left arm was covered in bandages, perhaps suggesting that this video was filmed after the customer's photo was taken.   

The woman wearing my face gave the camera an uncertain smile. She held up a hand, showing her palm, then turning it around to show the back. She then slowly set her hand palm-down on a small wooden table below her. The camera tilted downwards, following her hand in such a way that indicated another person was filming with a handheld. The camera lingered on her hand for a moment. I heard someone inhale. And then, a hammer came down on the woman's hand. 

After the blow, the camera jerked back up to her face. She started making this pained moaning sound. Her mouth twisted and I saw tears welling up in her eyes. The camera moved back down to her hand, where a deep bruise was already welling up under her skin. I paused the video here to scroll down, reading through the myriad of titles listed beneath it. The most recent link was called ""blunt force 33"", followed by ""blunt force 32"", ""puncture 12"".

 ""eye infection"". 

""needles under nails"". 

I felt dizzy. I had to stand up and pace around the room to keep from puking my guts out. Maybe I should've stopped there, but for whatever reason, I felt like I had some responsibility to finish. I pressed play once more. 

Down again came the hammer, this time landing atop the knuckle of her forefinger with a *crack*. Four more blows rained down on the hand, one for each knuckle. By the end, the sounds coming from the woman didn't seem entirely human. It didn't sound like me, but it was hard to tell. I'd never been in that kind of pain before. I didn't know what I'd sound like.

In the last few seconds of the video, the camera was raised and angled downwards such that you could see both ""Angelica's"" face and mangled hand. The shot gave the viewer a better view of her chest and the small, spade-shaped birthmark a few inches beneath her clavicle. It was this all-too-familiar mark that removed any lingering ambiguity about what I was watching. Angelica was no coincidence, no circumstantial doppelganger. 

She was a deepfake of *me.*

When the video ended, I sat staring at the final frame until my laptop went to sleep, too shocked to do anything else. I couldn't believe what was happening to me. I still can't. I've done everything ""right"": all my life I've kept my socials private and generally minded my own business. I've stayed modest, low-profile, and out of the spotlight for all of my young adulthood. I never even sent nudes to my ex-boyfriend, despite his insistence, because I was afraid of what would happen to them if we ever had a nasty breakup.   

As it turned out, we did have a messy breakup. In the immediate aftermath of that video, as I wracked my memory for answers, I couldn't help but think of my ex. If I were a public figure, then the culprit behind the deep fakes could've been anyone; but for a nobody like me, it had to be someone close. Someone with access to my private photos. The thought made me shudder. Could my ex really have taken things that far? Did he actually hate me that much? I had a sudden urge to call him and demand answers, but I knew that wouldn't get me far. It would be easy enough for him to lie if he was the culprit, and then he would know I was onto him.

There was much left for me to explore on the DOV3S website, but after my discovery, I wasn't in the right state of mind to keep investigating. I thought about calling someone, maybe Lydia or my parents, but for some reason, the thought of doing so filled me with tremendous embarrassment. Even though I knew deep down that it wasn't my fault, I couldn't help but feel ashamed of the videos, even if I had had no role in their creation. 

I needed sleep, but knew it would be nearly impossible, and so I popped a few sleeping pills and crossed my fingers. After tossing and turning in bed for a few minutes, I got up to use the bathroom, which required walking down the hallway past my front door. When I got to said door, I stopped, noticing a strange shadow coming from the hallway. It looked as though someone had placed an object right outside my door. I walked closer to look, about to crouch to peek under the door, when the shadow suddenly moved. It hadn't been an object at all, but rather a person standing in front of my door. I heard their footsteps thudding down the carpeted hallway. By the time I looked through the peephole, it was too late to see anyone, and I certainly wasn't about to open the door to look for them. I immediately suspected that it had something to do with the blue Cherokee, which was still parked across the street when I stole a glance out the window. 

Suddenly, I had no desire to sleep anymore, but the pills were already doing their job. I wanted to stay alert in case whoever was outside my door returned, but fighting against the drowsiness was like trying to outrun a monster in a nightmare. The last thing I imagined before I slipped into unconsciousness was my own face smiling jubilantly as a hammer smashed my hand into a [bloody pulp](https://www.reddit.com/user/11velociraptors/comments/1k9fr99/dov3s_info_page/).",4,1745790855.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I know there are a thousand posts about people not feeling well, not getting out of bed etc…this probably is going to be one of them. If you’re not interested in reading a longer text you should perhaps quit this one. ;)

I’m going to explain my situation at first and then try to underline the struggles I’m facing at the moment (been going through since I can remember). (Also sry, I’m not a native English speaker, so excuse any typos/grammar, my style of writing could also be considered a bit mixed up, but you hopefully get the message) (And before I forget, I’m new on Reddit so I don’t know if this is the right channel, feel free to move my post or tell me where it may belong)


I currently turned 24, not old, not young, I’d say if I die today it would be alright (even though I don’t want to!). I worked for the past 8 years, I hated my job for a long time, quit and am now working at the same job but at a different company and I like my job. I really like my colleagues and my bosses are amazing. Also I studied for the last three years at the afternoon and I’m grateful for making it this far. I have a best friend for over 10 years and at work I met a new close friend too. I’m included in her friend group and it’s the first time in my life that I feel like other people surrounding me understand my point of view about live and how difficult living in this society is (at least for me). How overwhelming other people/conversations/day to day live etc. are. They understand it and we’re all talking open about our emotions, how we feel and if someone would like to be alone even 
though we made some plans, it’s totally fine.

The situation with my family (and my childhood) is/was difficult, but I feel like it doesn’t effect me that much, as I’m thinking of myself as a rather grown up person who is responsible for their own well being. I’m living alone for nearly 6 years, I managed to move a few times, I’m (mostly) on time at work, don’t have any financial difficulties and I also go out quite often with my friends. All in all you could say I’m living a decent life and don’t have any unmanageable problems in it.



When I turned 18 I immediately went to see a psychologist. It wasn’t because I struggled with my childhood. I felt like I would like to manage things in my day to day life that seemed easy for others but not for me. For example: getting out of bed on time, having a morning routine, eat healthy, work out, hobby’s, doing things I would enjoy etc.

I’ve been to the psychologist for over five years and honestly, of course I as a person changed and yes I’m not hating myself anymore, it feels like it hasn’t helped me at all!

I’m still not having a routine, I still struggle to get out of bed every day, I’m not having any hobbies…


Last year I discovered drugs. I wanted to take drugs for a long time, since I always was curious about how it would make me feel and in general I always did the things I wanted to. Had the chance to do it when I was younger but it didn’t felt right at that moment so I waited. I took some last year and this year I honestly did some every week. I know it’s not a good thing but I enjoy it and I know it’s a phase that is going to pass when the time is right.

Took some chemical stuff, but also some mushrooms. I had a trip about 3-4 months ago ago where I talked to “the universe/god/souls” and it told me that everything is going to be alright, that we’re all connected and that I don’t have to worry. That trip healed something in me.

The other not so nice thing…I now am smoking weed every evening before going to bed (have for the last 4-5 months). At first it helped with my sleeping problems but now I feel like it made them even worse. Even that I don’t think of as a huge problem because it’s something I could/should be able to quit any time.

Next topic:

Healthy or at least not destroying lifestyle…

My habits at the moment are the worst!

Been going to work and afterwards studying for the last three years I had a workday of around 10-14 hours. I came home after Uni ate what ever I could get (and much of it/gained 12kg/26 pounds) binged some YouTube, slept and repeat. At the weekends I slept for 10-16 hours and tried to meet up with my friends and family. 

The last months I reduced my work time a bit because I wanted to learn for Uni…I didn’t do anything. The only thing I’m doing constantly is spending all my free time in bed. I’m not even making myself a coffee or something to eat. The only time I get up is when I’m meeting with someone. If I’m home alone I don’t feel like doing anything. But it bothers me because I nowadays consider myself worthy of being loved (by myself).
You could think; it’s because you have so much to do and you’re just tired…yes and no. I’ve done exactly the same before Uni. I’ve been studying the last three years because when I was getting home from work before the only thing I did was eating and watching useless s***. So I decided to do something with that time.



From time to time I honestly thought I had figured it all out…I was reading again, I had a healthy diet, worked out…but all of those things went to extremes. I wasn’t eating anymore, lost 1/6 of my weight in just 2 months, worked out every day, had an overwhelming routine.
No matter what I do I’m constantly in the extremes…I never ever in my life had a stable, healthy, well working schedule.

I’m overwhelmed by the huge amount of food while grocery shopping, the music in the background, picking something I would like to eat. When I’m out grocery shopping and I forgot to make a list before…it sometimes takes hours. I’d like to have a routine for my skin (got really bad), but it’s the same…so many offers that I can’t decide on what to pick. There are so many decisions to make in every day life and I can’t decide.

I’d like to read more again, cook for myself, spend relaxing time in the living room, bring things I used back to it’s place immediately, work out, learn some new skills and most importantly: discover what I like.

I tried EVERYTHING! 

I made myself some todo lists, I asked my friends to call me to wake me up in the morning, had a routine planned and set up at my bed for when I was waking up, made a workout plan at the gym, tried to prioritize, saw a psychologist for a long time, went to an adhs-specialist (she said I’m fine), read books about changing something, meditated, wrote diary and so on.

NOTHING helped me.

I just don’t know why I don’t do anything about it. Nearly every night before sleeping I tell myself: tomorrow you’re going to get up early and you’re going to do something for yourself…

I just can’t stick to anything. Every morning I wake up and I ask myself: Why should I get out of bed?
And every morning I can’t find a reason to do so. It’s been like this since I remember.



I would love to just wake up and enjoy the day.



If you have any suggestions at what might help, feel free to write. If you’re feeling the same, I hope you someday find peace my friend. ✨

1k9fknj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1k9fknj/went_on_a_first_date_with_a_girl_i_really_liked/,Went on a first date with a girl I really liked but not sure if she is interested for a second one or not. I’m new to dating and I want some help on how to read the situation and what to do.,"So I’ll give some context on how the date went. We are 21M and 23F and we met on bumble. We scheduled to meet 3pm, I arrive at 2:52 and she’s already there and we greet and start walking to a coffee shop she picked. On the way there she tells me that she has never been on a date before and that she’s really anxious. I tell her that I too just started dating (this is was my 7th date ever).

So we sit and order etc, and we talk and we have a lot of common interests (movies, series music etc), and at some point she pulls out her phone and she had made a long list of questions to ask to have stuff to talk about, I found that very cute and the questions were pretty fun and interesting, and in general we had really fun conversations and laughed a lot, even when there were a couple awkward pauses we just laughed.

At some point though, a friend calls her and she mutes the phone and she picked it up like 30-40 minutes later and told me she will be going to find some of her friends that are going to another coffee shop nearby. So after about 20 minutes we get going. 

The date was a bit over 2 hours, I’m just worried because maybe she had that as an exit strategy and she wanted to just leave, even though the vibes were good. I’m pretty inexperienced so I don’t know how to read that situation.

At the end of the date, she goes for a hug first and we say goodbye and she said it twice for some reason haha.

Then later I text her and we have the following conversation (translated from another language):

Me: I really had fun today :))

Me: Do you want to do something again this week?

(She replies 1hr later when usually she replies almost instantly)

Her: Me too, I’m just a bit sick so I don’t know when I will be able to (I did a test, it wasn’t Covid or flu)

Me: oh okay I hope you get well soon
 
Me: whenever you feel better feel free to text me to make plans if you want

Me: however if you don’t want to you can just tell me it’s alright

Her: thank you so much ^^ I will text you when I feel a bit better 

Me: alright talk to you then

Her: alright ^~^

-

Note: she actually did say at some point on the date that her throat was a bit sore

So I don’t know how to read the situation on if she actually wants to do a second date or if she is just making excuses because she is not interested. I just don’t want to wait a week or two to figure it out if she just ghosts me.

My friends told me to text her in a few days how she’s feeling and to recommend a date on the next weekend if she is feeling good then. However I feel like that is a bit pushy and since she hasn’t dated before it might be a bit overwhelming to ask for a date again.

Sorry for the long post, I just really clicked with her, much more than my other dates, and I love her personality and and she’s really cute, and don’t want to ruin this. I just want some advice on how to move forward and on how to read the whole situation because it’s causing me a lot of anxiety lol.

🔥Reunited with My Baby Daddy🔥: Met in NYU, she hid her pregnancy and left, raising their daughter alone for twelve years. 🧒 Until fate brought them face to face again. His eyes burned with possessiveness and fury. 😡


Chapter 1


Prologue



Nicol



Well, I’m setting in the dark on the steps of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City crying my eyes out. One of my co-workers couldn’t come to the event so he gave me the tickets he said I was working too hard. I didn’t have anyone to bring with or should I say everyone I asked told me it was going to be too uptight and they weren’t in the mood for something like that. So, I came alone to the event of the year, The Christmas Ball at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. I even went out and bought me a ball gown in deep green, it had a deep green corset top with little diamonds embroide on the top, not real diamonds off course and a fairy like skirt, I loved it and thought I looked good with my auburn hair it brought out all my best features like my auburn hair and my green eyes not that I was looking for attention or a date or anything like that, I don’t have the time for that. But what I didn’t expect was the reason I’m sitting here in the dark crying.



Why? You ask, well it’s a long story let’s start with, I just saw my first love the one that took my virginity the only man I’ve ever slept with and he was on the arm of a very hot and sexy super model. Why I’m surprised? I don’t know I mean I haven’t seen Nicolas in 12 years except if you want to count the times, I have cyber stalk him or looked at the social papers I would see him with some kind of supermodel on his arm. 



The next question might be why I haven’t seen him in 12 years. Well, that is a much longer story. See Nicolas and I was in NYU together we met and fell in love almost immediately; it was love at first sight for both of us, he told me all his dreams and what he was working towards, we where both studying business. He was studying business to become the new CEO of his dad’s Tech company, which he was raised to do. Legacy and all that. Although he felt he was raised in the company and don’t need a degree his father insisted. I on the other hand was at NYU to dance although I studied business dance was my passion. I didn’t have a family with a huge business I could take over I wanted to became my own boss one day and I needed to know how to do that, hence the studying business. Nicolas was always so supportive of me if it was with the dancing or the business, he even helped me with some of the subjects we were inseparable, we even talked about the future and getting married someday, we were both fully committed to each other. He suggested I open my own dance studio as a business then I can combine the two worlds he would have given me the money to do all that. To tell you the truth I was very keen on doing exactly that except the part of taking his money, my mom and dad pass away just before I went to NYU, they left me enough to get through Uni as well as a bit extra so I was okay. I would never take such a huge step with someone else’s money it doesn’t even matter that he will be my husband someday.



But the thing is life has a funny way to come and screw everything up. You can make plans as many as you like, dream about a white picket fence house with a dog someday the 2 and a half children and both successful careers and then WAM one misstep and everything falls apart. See Nicolas and I couldn’t get enough of each other especially after the first time we had sex or should I say the first time I had sex. I was addicted to him. I never thought sex could be so wonderful and make you feel so great so I wanted a lot of it, Nicolas didn’t mind at all because a man and what man in his 20s is going to say no to sex. We had sex a lot always very careful and then one night I remember it like yesterday. We were both flying high from an exam that went great, I got my dance results and that was awesome as well, we couldn’t wait until we got home from the bar we were celebrating at, I grabbed his hand and pulled him into an alley I didn’t have to tell him what I wanted because he wanted it to. I had a pink dress on with white sneakers and a pink G-string like I said I remember it like yesterday. Nicolas was wearing kaki shorts and a white t-shirt he pulled his pants down pushed me against the wall pushed my G-String to one side and fuck the living shit out of me. I had marks on my back for days after that encounter that is how hard we went at it. He didn’t stop fucking me hard against the wall and I was on to much of a high to even care I was clawing at him kissing him and him kissing me all over everywhere he could get a spot. That night was hot and a night I would never forget because that was the night we where both to excited to think about a condom and that is the night I got pregnant. That night was also the beginning of the end for us.



Needless to say, when I found out I was pregnant a month later I disappeared from his life. I moved, I changed my cellphone number. I was too afraid that if I see him, I will tell him about the baby and if there was one thing I wasn’t going to do was mess up the plans he had for his life. He worked his whole life to achieve what he had I was not going to be the one that rail road his plans. So needless to say, he has never met his daughter Nikki, I did use his name to get to hers. I had to have just another piece of him. 







Chapter 2


Prologue



Nicolas



I was standing at my floor to ceiling window in my Upper West Side apartment looking at the light snow falling from the sky. I’m a very successful CEO of my dad’s company at the age of 34 I never had anyone that got in the way of my success and I will never have a wife, fiancé or children for that matter. I’m known as the ultimate bachelor / playboy. I probably deserve that nick name and believe me I live up to it. I never have the same women on my arm never and they are all super models I’ll probable soon have to look for another profession but dancers were out, I hate dancers absolutely hate them. Why am I so passionate about that well it goes back to my Uni days? I was actually in love with a dancer we talked about everything our hopes and dreams everything the white picket fence the dog, children, holiday vacations absolutely everything. I would have given that women absolutely everything I had, but she ripped my heart out of my chest and I could never get it back. She just one day disappeared from my life without a word, she even changed her cellphone number and moved like in half a day. I saw her the morning and that afternoon when I went around her place to get her for dinner, she was gone with no letter nothing. I’m not sure why I’m thinking of it now, but then if I’m totally honest with myself this time of year get’s difficult for me because I always imagined us together for every special occasion or should I say for everything but after she ripped my heart out, I became the ultimate bachelor and playboy. NO serious relationships for me anymore or ever I never ever want to get hurt like that ever again. 



As I was standing there, I was feeling troubled like something bad or good I’m not sure what was about to happen I couldn’t put my finger on the feeling I had. And I had no idea why I felt so restless I just had Carmen or was it Camilla in my bed and fucked her every way possible I’m supposed to be relaxed, Carmen or Camilla whatever her name was, was getting ready to escort me to the Christmas Ball at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and I’m saying escorting me because we already had sex after the Ball she’s getting in a cab or maybe I’ll get her an Uber black and she can go back to her own place. I saw her reflection approaching me from the back she was swaying her hips trying to tempt me to take her again. She was wearing a shiny black dress with a slit that probable came up to her panty line, how she got in that dress only she will know. I knew the tricks of the models they always want to tempt you with more sex to be a permanent future in your life but that doesn’t work for me. Don’t get me wrong I will take it but I won’t take her to another function again nor would I invite her over again. She moved with her hands up my back feeling my muscles tense beneath my tux’s shirt. She must have thought it was a good thing but really, I was just tense, she turned me around and kissed me with her high heels she’s just as tall as me. She tried to deepen the kiss but I stopped her “We have to go.” “But…” “We have to go. I don’t like being late.” 



We went down to the limousine that was waiting for us, needless to say I tried to keep her of me the whole ride, I’m really not a modest guy so I will say I’m sexy as fuck and I work hard to keep it that way I run through Central Park 3 times a week and I gym at my apartment. I’m 6 ft, blue eyes and blond hair some people will say I have the look of a surfer boy I just think this is how I look and I work it. Then I can charm your pants of with just a few words. But enough of me. We arrived at The Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Paparazzi was ready to take photos of whoever gets out of the vehicles. As soon as they saw my blond hair the camera’s started to flash and screaming questions at me “Is this the one you are going to settle down with?” “Aren’t you tired of being alone?” To that I had an answer off course “I’m never alone have you ever seen me alone at an event.” And then I ignored them we let them take a few photos of us before we walked into the Museum. We were standing around drinking champagne when I saw a red head with a green gown from the back. It was like someone threw cold water over me because I was sure that was Nicol the girl that left me heart broken in Uni. I couldn’t be too sure because I didn’t see her from the front but I will never forget the way she walked and that hair I swore I will never date a red head ever in my life again but I knew that hair I knew that body. Carmen or Camilla saw the change in me “are you okay?” she asked “Yes will you excuse me for a minute?” I didn’t wait for her to answer me I just walked away. I wanted to see if it was Nicol but I didn’t want her to see me. I walked to one corner of the hall and tried to find her in the crowed it wasn’t too difficult not with that hair. I think when I saw her face I turned white out of pure shock it was her and she just got more beautiful than when I last saw her 12 years ago. 



Everything in me wanted to walk to her to find out why she left me, what she was up to for the past 12 years did she open her ballet studio? But more than that I wanted to hurt her I wanted to hurt her like she hurt me. So that is exactly what I did I went to find Carmen or Camilla now I probable have to admit I can’t remember her name. “I want to introduce you to someone. But I’m going to admit I forgot your name.” “No problem darling my name is Karen.” Fuck where did I find the name Carmen or Camilla but clearly, she thought me introducing her to someone meant I will stick with her. I took her by the arm and turned on the charm, when I reached Nicol, I tapped her on the shoulder when she turned around, I could see the shock on her face. “I thought it was you.” I said smiling at her but my eyes were telling a totally different story. “Nicolas” “Nicol so nice to see you again after 12 years.” I had to get that jab in. “It is.” “I want you to meet my date, Karen. Karen this is Nicol an old friend from my university days.” The look on Karen’s face was priceless “I thought you don’t like red heads.” Was the only thing she said. Then Nicol looked at me and I could see there was tears in her eyes. “If you’ll excuse me.” Then she basically ran out of the museum I don’t even think she took her coat. Well, I got what I wanted. I wanted to hurt her and I did. It didn’t feel nearly as good as I thought it would.







Chapter 3


Present day



Nicol



I’m still sitting on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of art, freezing my ass of but I just didn’t have the courage yet to walk back into the Museum. I should probably get the courage I can’t afford to get sick. I wiped the tears took my bag and walk up the stairs. I never thought seeing him again will have this kind of reaction out of me but I just realized yet again how much Nikki looked like him, I’m sure the only thing she got from me was her dancing skills other than that she was her dad. I walked into the museum and went straight to the bathroom I needed to fix my make-up I really don’t hope Karen will be in the bathrooms. I got in the bathrooms checked my make up did a few touch ups and then I went into a stall. I heard more women coming into the bathroom then they started to talk and I could hear Karen’s voice. “You guys won’t believe it he actually introduced me to someone I’m telling you I’m going home with him.” “Don’t think so girl Nicolas is not one that takes his dates home he fucks them before the function then he leaves alone.” “Sounds like you speaking out of experience?” Karen asked her. “I am, you do know he goes through girls like normal people goes through toilet paper right.” “But he wouldn’t have introduced me to someone if he didn’t have any plans, would he?” “Okay let me ask you was it a man or a woman?” “A red head and you all know how he feels about red heads.” Karen said. “Well then I don’t know I wanted to say he was probable trying to make that person jealous but if she’s a red head maybe you will get lucky.” The other girl said. 



I could feel the tears running down my face again. I can’t do this. I’ll just go to my table thank the doctors that is there then leave. I’m sure I’ll have a better time with Nikki than I’m having here. When I was sure the coast was clear I walked out reapplied my lipstick washed my hands then walked out of the bathrooms. I saw Nicolas standing at the bar but I ignored him I wasn’t ready for another encounter with him it just hurts to much clearly, I still love him. I don’t know how I doubt that I mean for the past 12 years I haven’t been on one single date and the only orgasms I’m getting is from my vibrator so I ignored him and went looking for my table. 



When I found the table with the other doctors, I greeted all of them I tried to make an excuse to get out of there but they didn’t want to except my apologies, “At least eat first” an older doctor said. “Yes, dear eat we will keep you company.” At the end I went to sit down and we started to chat about the hospital and I actually started to enjoy myself but the one thing that was irritating was the fact that my body still knows when Nicolas was close, I could feel him. It sounds stupid I know but I could really feel when he was close by. The starter was served with no new incidents which made me very relieved, before the main course was served it was time for speeches and thanking the people that contribute to the charity. I didn’t even know it was in honor of a charity. And the charity was actually for people who can’t effort to go to Bellevue hospital the hospital I worked at. How did I not know it. It makes sense now why all the doctors were here. But then they thanked their main contributor and they called him up to the stage and it was no one else but Nicolas Brown. He got on stage and made a point of not looking at our table he thanked the people that was sitting at my table but he didn’t look at them probable because he didn’t want to see me. I can’t believe his still angry with me but then I’m still heart broken so it makes sense. 



When he walked of the stage he came to our table and thanked all the doctors in person when he got to me, he said “I didn’t know you are a doctor, Nicol.” Before I could answer another doctor said “Oh no she’s not, she’s a nurse at our hospital the most hard-working nurse you will ever find.” “A nurse?” That surprised him a lot I could see it on his face. But then he greeted everyone and left our table leaving me in complete silence because I really didn’t know what to say to him. “Do you know him dear?” One of the doctor’s wife’s ask. “A long long time ago yes.” “Oh, if I’m you I’ll stay away from him his quite the ladies’ man, but that is only the gossip I heard.” “Don’t worry I’m not his type.” “Nonsense you are beautiful.” “Thank you.” I didn’t want to tell him he doesn’t go for red heads. The main course was served and we all chatted while we ate. Between the main course and dessert, the dance floor was opened then our song came up and I could feel the tears coming back fast but the worst thing was there was a tap on my shoulder when I looked around Nicolas was standing behind me “Can I have this dance?” I didn’t want to make a scene so I took his hand and the electricity that went through us was something only books were written about. I’m sure he could feel it to but he didn’t say a word he just led me to the dance floor. As soon as I was in his arms it felt like I was home for the first time in 12 years I felt home. Until he spoke. 







Chapter 4


Nicolas



I thought this night would be fun but I was in so much pain the whole night. I thought the endless women I had in my bed every weekend had cured me from Nicol but while she was in the same room as me, I couldn’t help but feel all the pain I felt 12 years ago. The worst thing of it all was I could feel her when I walked to someone, I could feel her being close to me, my body knew where she was at all times. I hated every minute I was thinking about breaking my rule and take Karen back to my apartment and fuck her again just to forget about Nicol but clearly, I’ve been doing everything wrong. When the MC called me to the stage and thank me for my contributions to the Bellevue hospital, I couldn’t even look at the table Nicol was sitting at and that is where all the doctors sat. I needed to thanked them for their hard work but I couldn’t not with Nicol there. Thinking of Nicol at a doctors table also didn’t make sense at all. I mean it’s not like she had a wedding ring on. Yes, that was the first thing I looked for. So, she is not married to a doctor, does this mean she became a doctor at the end? Well after my speech I swallowed my pride and walked up to the table thanking each of the doctors that was sitting there, then I looked at Nicol and said “I didn’t know you are a doctor, Nicol.” Before she could answer another doctor said “Oh no she’s not, she’s a nurse at our hospital the most hard-working nurse you will ever find.” To say I was surprised was an understatement she never ever spoke of becoming a nurse “A nurse?” Was all I said before I walked away, I didn’t even let her talk I mean clearly, I didn’t know her as well as I thought. 



I went back to my table where Karen was making small talk with all the tech guys of my company there was a few of them that was clearly drooling over her but I couldn’t care less. They can have her if they want her, I’m done with her. We ate our dinner they were talking about I don’t even know what my mind wasn’t at this table it was at the table with the red head and all the doctors. ‘A nurse?’ I said over and over in my head. I’m sure Karen was talking but I couldn’t hear her not with everything that was going on in my mind. “Nicolas!” She almost yelled at me and believe me if there is one thing you don’t do is you don’t raise you voice at me especially not in public. “What?” “Where were you?” “I’m right here and please don’t ever raise your voice for me again or wait you won’t be able to because I’m not seeing you again.” “What did you just say?” She asked “I know you are blond Karen but come on you do understand English I’m done with you.” Everyone at the table’s eyes got as wide as saucers they couldn’t believe what I was doing right in front of them. But I had enough I had enough of Karen and her clinginess and definitely her constant talking. “In that case I’m leaving.” She said. She probable thought I’ll beg her to stay. “As you wish.” She grabbed her bag and walked out of the Museum very upset. To tell you the truth I really didn’t care my attention was on the red head and what she did to me and the fact that I was clearly not over it yet. Suddenly the talking started again among the others sitting at the table and then I heard the band start playing Elvis’s song ‘I can’t help falling in love with you’ It was always our song mine and Nicol my body moved without me telling it to. I tapped her on the shoulder “Can I have this dance?” She turned and gave me her hand. I could swear I saw tears in her eyes but it was impossible I mean it wasn’t me that hurt her it was her that hurt me.



As soon as we got on the dance floor it was like we were never apart. We started to dance to our song just like the old days. I knew exactly what her body was going to do and she knew exactly what I was going to do. While we danced, I had an inside struggle with myself I so badly wanted to know why she left me 12 years ago but my head was telling me ‘If I ask her, she will know that I was still hurt about that’ The song was coming to an end and I didn’t say anything yet, just before the end I asked her “Why did you leave me?” She suddenly stopped dancing when I looked at her, she was crying the tears where streaming down her face. This time I couldn’t miss it. “This is not the place to talk about it.” She said “Then when? You just going to disappear again?” “You know where I work so no, I’m not disappearing.” Then she let go of my hand and literally ran out of the ball room. The second time she ran from me. ‘Fuck Nicolas isn’t this a sign?’ I asked myself as I was standing alone on the dance floor watching how her body disappear out the doors. 



I went back to our table and tried to get involved in the conversation at least no one asked me about that women that just ran from me I might have just exploded. When dessert was finished, I couldn’t take the small talk anymore I excused myself and walked to the door got my coat. My driver was at the entrance in seconds. “I’m going to walk Geoffrey.” “You sure Sir it is cold.” “I’m sure. You go so long.” Geoffrey knew not to argue with me so he left me to walk back to my apartment it wasn’t far, I enjoyed the cold it was something else I was feeling except for my heart breaking all over again. I thought about Nicol the whole way back to my apartment. She was right I did know were she worked if I wanted to, I can go to her I can ask her out and we can talk. Maybe I need closure but then again, she ran from me yet again tonight do I really want to put myself through all that yet again especially this time of year. 







Chapter 5


Nicol



I was crying the whole way to my apartment if it wasn’t so cold I would have walked but I just couldn’t take the cold as well not while I’m cold on the inside as well. The look Nicolas gave me during the night was of pure hatred. I knew when he asked me on the dance floor why I left him I might give in and tell him and I can’t do that if and that is a big if I tell him about Nikki, it will definitely be in private not between a lot of people because I had no idea what his reaction was going to be. Nikki was asking a lot of questions about her father these days. I lied to her and told him he died when she was just a baby. I didn’t know what to say ‘I ran from him because I was protecting him and took your father away from you.’ I don’t think that will go off smoothly she might never forgive me I mean she is 11 and like she likes to remind you almost 12 and she is getting at this stage where there are father daughter dances at school and she always have to sit it out. One of the gay nurses that worked with me offered to go with her but she told him everyone will know his not her father. He took it like a champ and didn’t blame her at all. But now she starting to ask ‘how her father was when he was alive? What did he do? And so on and so on’ When I got to the apartment, I paid the cab driver and walked up to my apartment. Alley Nikki’s nanny was still watching TV. “Nicol you back early.” “I am you can go home I know you like the weekends when you don’t have to look after our little monster.” I told Alley. We had a joke between the two of us because Nicol can get a lot like her father when she’s in a bad mood then we call her the little monster. Alley is my lifesaver; I walked most days overtime to be able to effort Nikki’s ballet classes so she is the one that takes Alley to school and brings her home and do home work with her. I’m on weekend duty. I made a deal with the management of the hospital that I can work as much overtime during the week but I can’t work weekends I needed to be at home on weekends to take Nikki to ballet and help her with projects for school and just have mother daughter time because during the week we don’t get that time. “Thank you, Nicol I’ll see on Monday morning.” “See you Monday.” 



When Alley was gone, I went to check in on Nikki she was sleeping like a baby. I walked closer to her and took the hair away from her face, she looked so much like Nicolas I realized that yet again tonight with her curly blond hair and blue eyes she even has the same skin color as him, they look naturally tanned I on the other hand is as white as a sheet. The curse of being a red head. Nikki stirred and open her eyes. “Mommy” “I’m right here angel, sleep.” “Okay mommy.” I tugged her in and she went to sleep immediately. 



I went to my room and got undress, took of my make up and got in my PJ’s then I went to the fridge and got some chocolate Ben and Jerry the only thing that will help now even if it is snowing outside. I sat on the coach thinking of tonight and how much Nicolas has changed not physically but emotionally his eyes was hard no matter who he looked at there was no shinning eyes anymore. He was still fit and beautiful but this Nicolas looks like he knew it and used it. I know I have to tell him sooner or later about Nikki because let’s face it one of them will find out eventually but does it have to be now? That was the question that was going through my mind over and over. I knew I was keeping a father away from Nikki and a father away from his daughter but would he even want her I mean with his life style will he even want a child messing that up. I know I was making excuses and I should stop and put my big girl panties on and just tell him and then decide how to tell Nikki but I think I’ll wait a little longer. I went to bed still with the same thoughts in my head should I or shouldn’t I. That is how I fell asleep. 



That night I dreamed about the first night Nicolas and I had sex, the night he took my virginity. We talked about it countless times and Nicolas wanted to make sure I was 100% sure I wanted to give him the honor of being my first and I was, I so was. I came back from class and went straight to his place, his place was obviously bigger than mine, when he opened the door for me and I walked in the whole room had candles in every nook and corner and there was rose pedals all over his bed, he took off his duvet it was only a sheet that was lying on the bed and he made sure it was a darker color because he warned me I might bleed, I told him I didn’t want to see it because it will make me embarrassed. He did everything right. He set the mood with the music, champagne and strawberries. My first words were “Wow Nicolas all this just for me?” “Yes, angel this is just for you.” Then he started to kiss me. I always knew I wanted him to be my first because when he kissed me my pussy felt weird, I told him once and he said it’s because I was getting turned on, he asked me if he could put his finger inside my pussy to feel. I told him he could. I pushed his finger into my pussy and something happened I don’t know what but it was nice. He pulled his finger out and showed me the moisture on his finger. ‘You see this angel?’ ‘Yes’ ‘This means you are horny.’ That is how I knew he will be my first. 







Chapter 6


Nicolas



When I got home, I went to take a shower immediately I needed to get warmed up. When I defrosted in the shower I got out and pulled my PJ’s pants on. I poured myself a stiff drink and downed it then another, and another. I did this for the first year after she left me, I drank myself to sleep every night because life without her was just too much to bare. And here I am again tonight drinking, drinking to be able to sleep. When I got to my 10th drink, I stumbled to my bedroom and fell onto the bed and passed out. At 3 am I woke up and went to the bathroom then I went to the kitchen to get myself some headache tablets and water lots and lots of water. After I drank the headache tablets and the water I went back to bed. I fell asleep almost immediately but then I started to dream of Nicol and our first night together. She was so afraid I promised her I wouldn’t hurt her I will take it slow. I set the scene while she was at dance class. I put candles in every nook and corner of my room, I threw red rose pedals on the bed. I made sure I had a darker sheet on the bed, I didn’t want her to see the blood because I knew she will be embarrassed. We’ve been going out for a while now but we didn’t have sex yet just because I was respecting her and I wanted to make sure if I take her virginity I won’t run away the next day like so many guys do. To say she was surprised was an understatement with all the effort I made she knew we were going to have sex that afternoon she just didn’t know about the rose pedals and the candles.



I walked closer to her and took both her cheeks in my hands and started to kiss her, she opened for me immediately that allowed me to devour her mouth. She was kissing me back with as much passion as I was putting into the kiss. She dropped her bag and I started to undress her, I pulled her shirt over her head when I looked at her, she was wearing the most stunning red bra it didn’t cover much. “You did this for me?” I asked her. “Yes. Is it okay?” She said shyly. “You look stunning angel thank you for making the effort.” She needed words of affirmation and a lot of it. I kissed her nipple while I went down to her skirt and pulled it down over her ass, she had the matching red panty on. I pushed my nose between her legs and took a big sniff. When I looked at her, she was blushing. “You smell so ready for me.” She just smiled clearly; she didn’t know what to say. When I got rid of the shirt and skirt, I walked her towards the bed and kissed her until the back of her knees was touching the bed. Then I let her slowly went down on the bed lying on her back. “Angel, I want you to lie still.” I told her, I had a bit of a dominant side to me but I won’t let it come out totally not tonight I didn’t want to scare her. “I will.” “It’s going to be difficult angel but please try for me.” “Okay Nikki.” She said. She was the only one that ever called me Nikki other people will call me Nico but never Nikki, I liked it that she had a name for me that no one else had.



I started with her mouth kissing her while she kissed me right back then I moved down to her neck. She loved being kissed in the neck I’m very sure if I touched her pussy right now, she will be wet as fuck. But I held myself back then I went down and kissed her nipples through the bra. I slowly took the bra off and started to play with her breast over and over. She was moaning and trying her utmost to stay still. Then I moved down to her belly button and kissed her there and on her stomach, then I went down to her pussy, I pushed my nose over her panty again and smelled she smelled like heaven on earth. I pulled her panties down and she started to move trying to cover herself. “Angel don’t move.” “But” “But nothing I’ll take care of you don’t worry lie back and relax okay.” “Okay.” Then she gotten still again. When she was naked in front of me on the bed a stood up and looked at her. She looked back at me but there was just lust in her eyes I needed to make sure she wasn’t afraid but what I saw was the same that was probable reflecting in my eyes and that was lust and lots and lots of that. I went to my knees at the end of the bed and pulled her towards me. She gave a small yell but then she got quiet and still. I just surprised her. Then I started to push my tongue between her pussy lips. “Fuck” she screamed. “Hold on angel.” When my tongue touched her clit, she sat up straight so fast. “Angel relax.” I pushed her down to lie down again. “What’s that?” “That’s your clit angel and I’m going to make you feel great just keep still.” “Okay.” Then I started to work her clit she was starting to move her hips pushing her lower body towards my face I didn’t mind that at all I pushed a finger inside her and then she came “Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Nikki Oh my God.” She kept on saying over and over again. I stopped and moved towards her mouth then I kissed her and she kissed me back. “Can you taste yourself on me?” I asked her “MMMMM” she moaned. “Okay angel hold on I’m going to push inside you now it’s going to be sore for a minute or two and then you will adjust to my size okay.” “Okay.” But she immediately tensed up again. “Relax angel.” I aligned my dick to her entrance but started to kiss her again until I felt her body relax and then I started to pushed my dick into her pussy. She was so tight, “Fuck” I hissed as I pushed into her “You, okay?” I asked her. But she didn’t say anything. I looked at her and there was a tear in her eye. “I’m going to stop.” I told her “No you won’t dare, push in.” “As you wish angel.” Then I pushed in fast “Fuck” both of us screamed. And with that word I woke up with my dick in my hand almost in a vise grip. 







Chapter 7


Nicol



I dreamed of the first time he pushed into me and how sore it was, but I kept still as he told me to and waited, he was kissing me taking my attention away from the pain in my pussy and then he started to move slowly and the pain was disappearing. It was getting nicer and nicer so nice I started to move my hips as he was moving on top of me. He bend down while moving in and out of me and took one nipple in his mouth. I could feel myself getting wet around him that just made him move faster in me. “Fuck angel you are so wet.” I didn’t know what to say I didn’t know how to talk dirty or what the protocol is with things like this, so I didn’t say a word, my breathing just got heavier and heavier. He kept on pushing into me and he hit a spot that made me want to do what I did previously I think I came. “Nikkie?” I said. “Angel” he said as he kept on moving. “I think I want to cum.” That surprised him a bit, “Then cum angel you don’t need my permission to cum, not yet.” He said I didn’t know what he meant by that but another few strokes in and out of me and I came. “Oh my God” I screamed. I must have said that real load because I woke up and I could feel I was wet between my legs. “Well, I don’t have to waste this.” I said out load. I took my vibrator out of my draw and pushed the pink vibrate into my pussy positioning the rabbits’ ears on my clit then I put it on and like always all I could imagine was Nicolas face every time he fucked me. It didn’t take very long before I came, I had to keep quiet as I’m sure Nikkie will wake up very soon so I bit into my pillow as I came. And on key Nikki ran into the room and jumped onto the bed. I pushed my vibrator next to me under the blankets. “Morning mom” “Morning angel how did you sleep?” “Okay and you?” “Good thank you.” She got on her knees “Tell me how was your ball last night.” Oh, my goodness Nikki if you just knew I ran into you father last night. “It was nice.” “Were there any beautiful men you can bring home that can become my dad?” Fuck that was also the latest she was looking for me to date so she could get a dad. “No angel, let’s go make some pancakes.” “Oh, cool pancakes.” Just like that she forgot about the men in my life and the dad she so desperately wanted. 



We went to the kitchen and we started on the pancake mix this was a Saturday tradition. Then if it’s cold outside we will sit in front of the TV watch a movie before we go out to dance class. But I had to ask her every Saturday what she wanted to do because it was her day. “So, what do you want to do after pancakes?” She didn’t jump up and say she wanted to watch a movie she was thinking while pushing the blueberries into the pancake. “Can we go for a walk in Central Park?” That confused me a lot. “A walk in Central Park?” “Yes” “Off course we can but you normally want to watch movies?” “The big children go walk in Central Park and drink coffee, I’m a big kid I want to do that.” “You only 11 angel.” “I’m almost 12 mom I’m almost going to high school.” God forbid. “Okay but I’m not buying you coffee.” “Can I get hot chocolate then?” “Yes, angel you can.” Then she jumped up from her chair and ran around the counter to give me a hug “Thank you mom.” “Off course angel you know Saturdays are your day.”



We ate our pancakes then we both went to our rooms to get ready; I yelled at her to remember to wear warm cloths and to bring her dancing bag with. She walked into my room with her hand on her hip “Mom you don’t have to yell I do know what to do.” Then she turned around and walked out. Another trade she got from her dad he hated anyone yelling at him or just yelling overall. I finished showering and got dressed in a jean, t-shirt, jersey and had a jacket ready to go out and then my last piece of the outfit was my red boots, which I loved of course. When Nikki came out of her room it was like someone told us what the other person is going to wear, she was also wearing her jeans, a jersey hopefully she has a t-shirt on underneath that jersey and red boots because she made me buy her red boots that fits with mine. She gave me a look “Oh no we can’t.” She said. Fuck I have a teenager in the house. “Well, it’s getting late and if you want to walk in Central Park have a hot chocolate and be on time for dance classes there is no way one of us can go and switch outfits.” She gave a big sigh “Okay fine.” We took our jackets from behind the door and walk out of the apartment. I had to make sure “You have all your dancing things?” “Yes, mom I’m almost 12 I’m not 9 anymore.” Well okay then I thought. When we got outside, I called a cab and we both got in “Central Park please.” Nikki was looking out of the window looking at the buildings and the snow that was falling. “You excited for your dance glass?” “Oh yes we are busy to practice The Nutcracker for our Christmas show.” “That’s nice angel.” “It is and …..” She got quiet. “And what angel?” “It’s the daddy daughter dance again in a week.” “Oh” Now her obsession started to make sense again. “Do you think your friend from hospital will go with me?” “But I thought you didn’t want him to go with.” “I don’t want to miss out again this year.” “Okay I’ll ask him.” “Thank you, mommy.” She only calls me mommy some times and I treasure those moments every time.” 



We got to Central Park and Nikki was running in front of me “Angel stay with me please.” “Okay but I want to go to the fountain.” “What fountain.” She pointed at the one she wanted to go to. “You first want to get your hot chocolate and then sit there?” “Yes please.” We walked over to a small stall and I bought 2 Hot chocolates. I gave Nikki’s hers and took mine as we walked to the fountain someone ran into me causing me to spill the whole hot chocolate all over my jacket. “Hey watch where you going.” The man said but I got ice cold because that voice belonged to no one other than Nicolas.

 But recently, one of my girls--Freida--has started hiding under the coffee table a lot more, and spends most of her time under there for the past couple days. She still responds to pets very positively, and doesn't seem bothered when gently prodded anywhere on her body, and she can be lured out to play before going right back under once she's done. She also still sleeps with my husband on the bed.

The biggest change is that she's recently become pretty hostile with her brother. Any time he comes near her she growls and starts swatting, which in turn seems to upset him and they'll get into fights more frequently. Like I said earlier, this has never happened before, and they've all been together for 2+ years, so I don't think it can be attributed to still getting used to each other.

To anybody who might have a similar experience with their cats, is there a chance Frieda is sick? Or has her behavior just changed because she's been fighting with her brother more often?",2,1745790626.0,CATHELP,2,1.0,False

I used Mitolyn for 180 days to see if it works. My aim was to share my long-term experience, not just a quick review.



This isn't just another Mitolyn review. I tracked my energy, mood, and sleep for six months. You'll see if Mitolyn's ingredients really help real people.



I'll explain the science, the benefits, and the drawbacks. And why six months are more important than a 30-day test. You'll find out if the cost is worth the results. No marketing tricks here—just my true thoughts after 180 days.

My Journey with Mitolyn: Why I Decided to Try This Supplement

For years, I relied on coffee to get through the day. But, I couldn't shake off the feeling of constant tiredness and brain fog. That's when I started looking into mitolyn reviews. They talked about how it supports mitochondria, which I hoped would give me natural energy without the crash of caffeine.



I did my homework before trying mitolyn. I looked at 10 other supplements, checking their science and what people said about them. A nutritionist suggested focusing on NAD+ boosters, which mitolyn has. I also checked out LabDoor and PubMed to make sure it was safe.



Before starting, I tracked my health:



Category: Baseline

Energy levels (1-10 scale): 5

Sleep quality (hours/night): 6

Cognitive performance (self-assessment): Moderate



I was a bit skeptical at first. I'd tried B-vitamins and adaptogens before, but they didn't do much for me. Still, after talking to my doctor and getting the green light, I decided to try mitolyn for 180 days. This trial was on my own, not sponsored by the company, so my thoughts are my own.



What Exactly Is Mitolyn? Understanding the Supplement

Mitolyn is a dietary supplement made from natural ingredients. It aims to boost cellular energy and overall wellness. The product claims to be scientifically backed, but its exact formula is a secret.



During my 180-day trial, I learned about its purpose. It's meant to improve energy and tackle age-related metabolic issues.



The manufacturer says Mitolyn targets nutrients to mitochondria, the cell's energy centers. Ingredients like CoQ10 and adaptogens are key, but the full list is kept secret. It comes in vegetarian capsules, taken twice a day with meals for better absorption.



Intended for adults 30+, focusing on those seeking energy support and vitality.



Claims to boost physical endurance and mental clarity through mitochondrial support.



Available as easy-to-take capsules with a 90-day supply per bottle.

Marketing talks about “clinically studied” benefits, but there's not much independent research on Mitolyn. Ingredients like CoQ10 are known for their energy roles. But, the product's unique effects need more study. Users should follow dosage instructions carefully, as timing and diet can affect results.



Visit The Mitolyn Official Website And Enjoy Best Prices/Deals Available Here!➤➤➤ 



My research found Mitolyn targets those who want to stay healthy. It's easy to take, but results can differ. As I continued my trial, I watched how these aspects matched up with real experiences.



Complete Breakdown of Mitolyn Ingredients and Their Purported Benefits

Let's dive into what makes up Mitolyn. Each part is picked for a reason, backed by science. Here's a closer look:



Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA): With 300mg per serving, it matches research for boosting energy and fighting stress. It comes from EU-approved places, ensuring it's pure.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): The 100mg dose is in line with studies on heart health and energy in cells. Mitolyn uses a form that's easier for the body to absorb.



Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR): At 500mg, it helps the brain and energy use. Studies show it can help older adults think better.

Mitolyn also has vitamins B12 and biotin to help absorb nutrients better. It has a special mix of adaptogens, like ashwagandha, with 5% withanolides. This is checked by labs to make sure it's right.



Every batch is tested to make sure it's as promised, with NSF International and USP-verified sources. The amounts of ALA and CoQ10 are as high as in studies, which could mean it works as well. Even though the effects together are not proven, the focus on energy in cells is clear.

My First 30 Days Using Mitolyn: Initial Impressions and Early Results

Starting Mitolyn, I tracked changes weekly for honest mitolyn reviews. The first week was quiet—no sudden energy boosts. But the sleek packaging made mornings easier. The powder mixed well in water, though it tasted a bit bitter. Adding citrus juice was a small tweak.



Week 1: No big changes, but I noticed better focus at work. Keeping the bottle on my desk helped me stay on track.

Week 2: My muscles felt less tired after exercise. I started a sleep journal, which showed a 30-minute improvement in sleep.

Week 3: I felt more stable in my mood. The packaging was still a plus, with no spills on the go.

Week 4: By day 28, I compared my progress to what the maker said. Some energy gains matched their claims, but I wondered if it was just my mind. Tracking my sleep and workout stamina helped clear things up.

Using Mitolyn was easy—no stomach issues, and the 30-day supply fit my routine. But the taste was sometimes a problem. My early feedback shows that sticking to the plan is key. While some benefits matched what Mitolyn promised, patience is crucial. This month helped me set realistic goals for the future.



The 90-Day Milestone: Mid-Point Mitolyn Reviews and Personal Assessment

At the 90-day mark, I looked at how Mitolyn matched up to its promises. Many supplements say you'll see big changes by this time. So, I checked my progress against what they said.



I was hoping for more energy and better health markers. My experience was close to what they claimed, but with some surprises. The first month was okay, but by day 90, things got clearer. My sleep got 20% better, just like they said. But, my brain clarity was a bit off from what they promised.



Category Company Claim My Experience

Energy Levels Steady daily energy Consistent but gradual increase

Sleep Quality 25% improvement 20% measurable gain

Biomarkers Improved lipid profiles Triglycerides down 15%



After 30 days, I changed my dosage to one capsule a day because of stomach issues. This change kept the good results coming without losing any benefits. I felt less tired in the afternoons, and my health markers showed some real changes.



Overall, the 90-day check-up showed some of Mitolyn's benefits were real. But, it also showed some gaps in what they promised. This review shows how important it is to adjust for yourself and track long-term to really see how well something works.

Months 4-6: Long-Term Effects and Sustained Benefits

Looking at the benefits of Mitolyn after 90 days showed a detailed view. By month four, the energy boosts stayed steady. But focus and mental clarity kept improving.



I kept a daily journal to track changes. Some benefits, like better sleep, didn't grow much. But others, like stamina in workouts, got even better by month five.



Unexpected benefits showed up: better problem-solving and lower stress under pressure.

But, stress weeks made focus waver. It went back to normal once things settled down.

Using Mitolyn long-term didn't lead to big drops in benefits. Skipping doses, even once a week, made me feel a bit off. Taking a week off at month five made me feel slow for 48 hours. This shows we need to keep taking it to feel sharp.



This long test shows how Mitolyn fits into our lives. Short-term feedback is just the start. Months of use show how benefits grow. If you're thinking about using it for a long time, keep a journal. And don't forget to take breaks if you hit a wall.



Side Effects and Drawbacks I Experienced with Mitolyn

In my 180-day mitolyn reviews journey, being open about side effects was key. I tracked every reaction, sorting them by how bad they were, how long they lasted, and when they happened. This part talks about what I went through, how I handled it, and my thoughts on the risks and benefits.



At first, I had mild stomach discomfort for a week, which went away after I changed my dosage. But, I also had headaches from weeks 4 to 6. These were likely due to caffeine-like parts in the formula. Here's a summary of my experiences:



Side Effect Severity Duration Timing Management

Mild stomach upset Mild 1–3 days Days 1–7 Halved dose for first week

Occasional headaches Moderate 2–3 days Weeks 4–6 Adjusted intake timing with meals

Slight insomnia Moderate 1–2 days Evenings (early use) Moved dosage to morning



Some side effects seemed to be caused by certain ingredients, like caffeine, and when I took them. Taking them with meals helped a lot. While these side effects were not too bad, they did need some changes. Still, the energy and focus benefits were worth it for me. My own risk-benefit check points to the formula's advantages, but others might want to think about their sensitivity to things like coenzyme Q10 or caffeine.

30-day supply $180 $6.00 None

60-day supply $340 $2.83 10% off

90-day supply $480 $1.78 20% off + free shipping

Compared to others like XYZ Energy and ABC Vitality, Mitolyn's 90-day package is 15% cheaper. Subscriptions get an extra 5% off. Standard shipping costs $10, but orders over $300 ship for free.

Comparing My Experience with Other Mitolyn Reviews Online

My 180-day journey with Mitolyn shows some common trends in online feedback. Many reviews from 2025 talk about energy boosts and mental clarity in the first month. But, opinions on long-term effects are all over the place.



When it comes to side effects, opinions are split. About 45% of reviews mention digestive discomfort early on. But I didn't experience any side effects. The length of use also matters—some stopped before 60 days, which can affect their results.

Here's a table that summarizes key points from over 500 online reviews:



Aspect Common Mitolyn Reviews (2025) My Experience

Time for benefits 2–4 weeks 3 weeks (aligned)

Top complaint Price vs. results Agree—cost concerns are valid

Side effects Mild (30%) to severe (10%) None reported

Lifestyle impact Best with exercise Most improvement came with diet changes

Most users took 2 capsules daily, but I only took 1 because of sensitivity. Sponsored posts often don't mention long-term costs. But real feedback stresses the importance of consistency. My results match 60% of organic reviews, but I didn't experience side effects. This might be because I took a lower dose. It's important to consider your own lifestyle and health when reading mitolyn reviews.



Conclusion: My Final Verdict After 180 Days of Mitolyn

My 180-day mitolyn reviews 2025 show mixed but meaningful results. I felt more energetic and recovered faster from workouts, matching the product's claims. But, these benefits faded after the first month.



Some mild side effects like stomach sensitivity happened when I took it without food. But, adjusting when I took it helped a lot.



Active adults might find it helpful for energy or workout support. Those with sensitive stomachs should start with small doses. Combining Mitolyn with regular exercise and healthy meals made it more effective.



I plan to use it at half the dose for maintenance. It meets some promises, but everyone reacts differently. Before trying it, check out 2025 reviews and talk to a doctor.



Mitolyn is best when used as part of a healthy lifestyle, not alone. My experience shows it's worth trying for specific goals. But, it needs to be tailored to avoid any discomfort.

Let me start this review by saying this – PrimeBiome isn’t just another supplement on the shelf. It’s a total game-changer. If you’ve been dealing with gut problems, low energy, bloating, weight gain, or constant fatigue, and you’ve tried everything from diets to detox teas, this review might just be the best thing you’ve read all year.



Because I was in your shoes. Tired, sluggish, and frustrated beyond belief.

My Gut Was a Mess – And So Was My Life

For years, I struggled with gut issues. I’m talking about constant bloating, random stomach cramps, gas, embarrassing bathroom issues, and a stubborn weight that refused to go away no matter how “healthy” I tried to eat.



Every morning, I would wake up with a heavy stomach. By 2 PM, I needed a nap. My skin was dull, my energy was at rock bottom, and my mental clarity? Non-existent.



I tried probiotics from the drugstore. I tried fiber powders. I even tried eliminating foods like dairy, gluten, and sugar. But nothing worked – at least not consistently. And worst of all, I started to believe that this was just “how my body is now.”



That’s when I discovered PrimeBiome.



What Is PrimeBiome?

PrimeBiome is a premium gut-health formula that goes beyond just being a probiotic. It’s loaded with high-quality, clinically proven strains of probiotics, prebiotics, digestive enzymes, and more.



But what makes it truly stand out is this:



And the best part? It does all this naturally.



Week-by-Week Experience Using PrimeBiome

Let me break it down so you know exactly what to expect:





✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available >>> 



✅ Week 1 – Immediate Relief

Within just 3 days, I noticed that my bloating had drastically reduced. I could eat my favorite foods again without doubling over in discomfort. I wasn’t running to the bathroom, and for the first time in years, I felt… normal.



It’s hard to explain how powerful that is unless you’ve lived with daily gut issues. It felt like my body was finally cooperating with me.



✅ Week 2 – More Energy, Better Sleep

By the second week, my energy was on another level. I didn’t need coffee to keep my eyes open. I was getting through work with full focus and actually sleeping deeply at night.



Oh, and something I didn’t expect? My skin started clearing up. I wasn’t even using any new skincare products – it was all internal healing from PrimeBiome.



✅ Week 3 – Slimmer Waistline, Less Cravings

This week was when I really started to feel and see the weight loss benefits. I wasn’t bloated, my pants were looser, and I noticed I had way fewer cravings for sugar and carbs.



I later found out this was due to the balanced gut bacteria PrimeBiome supports, which helps regulate appetite and hunger hormones.



✅ Week 4 – Total Body Transformation

By the end of the month, I felt like a brand new person. I had dropped 6 pounds without changing my diet. My digestion was flawless. I wasn’t bloated at all. My mind was sharper. I was even in a better mood.



And get this – people started noticing. Friends asked me if I had started working out (I hadn’t!). One coworker said, “You’re glowing lately, what are you doing differently?”



The answer: PrimeBiome.



What’s Inside PrimeBiome That Makes It So Effective?

Let’s quickly look at what makes this formula so powerful:



11 Proven Strains of Probiotics (including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) – for restoring good gut bacteria



Prebiotic Fiber – to feed and support those healthy bacteria



Digestive Enzymes – for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients better



Zinc, Magnesium & Turmeric – to reduce gut inflammation and improve immunity



It’s non-GMO, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free, and manufactured in a GMP-certified facility in the USA. That’s quality you can trust.



Why PrimeBiome Is Better Than Any Other Probiotic I’ve Tried

I’ve tried 7 different gut health supplements before. Most of them gave me either:

It doesn’t just give you probiotics – it gives you the whole system (enzymes + prebiotics + gut-healing minerals)

Who Should Try PrimeBiome?

Honestly? If you’ve experienced any of the following, PrimeBiome is worth trying ASAP:



Bloating or gas after meals



Food intolerances or random stomach pain



Low energy or constant fatigue



Mood swings or brain fog



Difficulty losing weight or stubborn belly fat



Skin problems like acne or dullness



Poor sleep or low immunity



Because these are all linked to an unbalanced gut – and PrimeBiome helps restore it naturally.



Final Verdict: This Is More Than a Supplement – It’s a Life Upgrade

If you’re tired of feeling off, bloated, or just not like yourself – PrimeBiome might just be the one thing that transforms your health from the inside out.



It did for me. I wake up energized. I digest better. I feel lighter. My mind is clearer. And I honestly feel 10 years younger.

1k9fbux,https://www.reddit.com/r/Periods/comments/1k9fbux/unregular_periods/,Unregular periods,"(Slight NSFW) I got off DEPO about 5-6 months ago and thought I’d have gotten a period by now. Today, while i was making coffee i felt like something was leaking, so i ran to the bathroom to see what it was, it was little brown dots. It stopped as soon as it started, but I’m still getting cramps. My moods also been all over the place for those 5-6 months i haven’t been on. I want to consult my doctor, but i don’t know where i’d start or if it’s worth checking out if this is normal for people who’ve used DEPO. 
Just a side note, before DEPO, i was alternating between different types of birth controls, one of them was working for a while, but then i had to switch to an off brand version due to Insurance. That switch messed with my menstrual cycle and made me have a period every other week. Insurance told me that they had an error in their system and that i never had to switch. Thinking switching back would help, i went back onto the previous birth control, but my menstrual cycle didn’t improve, i continued to have heavy bleeding every other week. So i started DEPO about 3 months after, i was on DEPO for 6 months until i decided to stop because it was messing with my mood and causing a lot of weight gain. 
I’ve also never been sexually active, so i’ve ruled out miscarriage and other things that you could get from being intimate. ",1,1745790134.0,Periods,0,1.0,False

1k9f82t,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1k9f82t/suffering_extreme_anxiety_centred_around_my_meta/,Suffering extreme anxiety centred around my meta,"Hi all, thanks in advance. 

TW - mentions thoughts of self harm. 

There feels like a lot more than I can fit here, but I'll try to keep it as terse as possible. 

I suffered a colossal mental breakdown in February this year, caused as far as I can see by a chain of difficult life circumstances which made me lose sight of who I was and where I was going. 

I'm self employed & had been working too hard, am a father and had been taking on more than my share of household labour, suffer from mild depression, struggle to say no and look after my own needs.. had my dad's brother die to a brain tumour in August (he had complete dementia set in over the course of a few weeks and died a few months later - it made me consider my dad's mortality in a way I have not before), and had 3 fledgeling relationships fizzle out in the space of a couple of months. Then I met someone I really like and my partner essentially vetoed them (""I'm not telling you who you can or can't date but I can make my decisions about if I stay in a relationship with you..."" - in the end I understood her discomfort and acted accordingly) and finally, my partner hooked back up with an old fwb, who she had told me she would not see again, as he was not treating her well. 

The symptoms were a week-long panic attack, followed by absolute emotional collapse - huge downswings, uncontrollable sobbing, loss of grasp on reality, thoughts of suicide, anger, resentment, sorrow... Completely useless as a human for several weeks. The month or so that followed was marked by occasional good days, and huge uncontrollable downswings, caused by absolutely any mention of, or reference to (no matter how tenuous), this fwb. 

(Just as an aside for context, they had been on / off for 2 years at this point, I've met him and like him, I appreciate his input in her life, and I had barely dealt with even low level jealousy up until that point. I believe I am just burned out with everything else that happened at the tail end of last year.) 

I have done a lot of work on all of this. I've come to a much better place with workload, household labour, and free time for myself. I've spoken to the doctor and seeked therapy which have both helped. I'm not currently taking medication but it's an option (ssri's like citalopram being floated). I turned them down because last week, when I last saw the doctor, I was doing amazing. Dealing with all manner of normal life difficulties with ordinary human reactions - get frustrated, find the right course of action, do it, move on with life. (Previously I would be in pieces over something as simple as having to wash a coffee cup before making my coffee.)  

Then, my partner saw her boyfriend for 45 minutes (for the first time in a month), for a cup of tea on his lunch break. I was fine at the time - actually delighted because I am so upset at myself with how I have so far impacted her ability to connect with him. But shortly after that, I spiralled, and have been a wreck for 3 days. 

I know the answer is therapy. However that is a long term answer, and I need to make some difficult decisions to survive (emotionally, but perhaps also literally) in the short term. I need to decide if to break it off with my partner (of 15 years, mother of my child, co-owner of a lovely home, otherwise wonderful human and excellent life partner...) or... I don't know what the other options are. I can't ethically ask her not to see him. 

I'm aware this is a me problem. I feel like it's reptilian brain making a threat out of nothing, and I feel I can ""get better"" with help and time. My partner has been amazing throughout, offering validation, love, affirmation, care, good listening, lots and lots of patience... Actually to the point where I feel I don't deserve it. I feel great remorse that I am affecting her ability to function, and impacting her relationship with her boyfriend/ fwb (how can she comfortably see him, knowing how it affects me..?) They see each other quite irregularly, and he hasn't been filled in on what I'm dealing with - only that I'm struggling with mental health and it's impacting her emotionally. 

My main concern at this point is that I am not available as a father. Our daughter is 9 and going through the usual tween things, and she needs me to be a dad, not a sobbing, emotionally and physical unavailable mess.

Edit to add: 

I'm currently between therapists - my previous one, a recommendation, was not versed in polyamory and it showed. I have a therapist coming up on the NHS within the next month. I've got a recommendation of a poly-feiendly therapist if that doesn't help. 

I have been talking a lot (maybe too much) with my partner and have been since the start. We have some unhealthy patterns in our communication but mostly it is honest and careful. I also have a lot of really good friends that I have been able to open up to. Unfortunately none of them are poly. I recognise I need more poly friends, but that is easier said than done, and is also a long term solution. ",3,1745789851.0,polyamory,3,0.8,False

Consider the level of wear and tear the bench will endure and choose a material that can withstand it.For commercial use, opt for a durable storage bench that can handle frequent use.

1k9f54a,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1k9f54a/us_army_combat_officer_are_you_thinking_about/,US Army Combat Officer? Are you thinking about getting out?,"This pertains to combat-arms junior Army officers who are thinking about getting out.

I saw on LinkedIn, a friend became an Army major. He’s “having a blast” on his broadening assignment in some poor, small town in some fly-over state. He’s looking forward to go the middle of Kansas for ILE (AKA a masters program according to Field Grades), then serving on Division staff, then BN staff, then staff after BN staff, then probably another leadership school back in Kansas. Ooo he can’t wait he says. His wife is gearing up to move to another army installation small town, sacrificing her own career… again, and send her kids to one of them army town schools. She can’t wait to go to the local military base coffee shops and bars with all the other military spouses she said! All to not see her husband for the next remaining years of his career. 

Don’t waste your late twenties and all of your thirties doing something you don’t like. You only get one of those. If you like the army or you like its opportunities like VTIP (only to come back to a BDE, DIV, or CORPS staff), 2-year broadening assignment (again, to come right back to FORSCOM), or paid grad school (forget the GI Bill I guess…), or you’re still chasing that CIB/CAB/deployment to justify your service (cool, you deployed as a Field Grade… true “combat” leader), then stay in. If not, then get out and EXPLORE YOUR ONLY LIFE WHILE YOU’RE STILL YOUNG.

Some tips:

-Resume is your life blood. Think about what you want to do and work on certs. This will set you apart. If you want to get into management, get your PMP, Scrum master, LSSGB. Get microsoft excel certs (your XO/staff excel skills don’t count). Finance? pass your SIE and work on finance certs. You get the point. Add those to your resume, I promise that will set you apart from your peers who just have a bachelors degree and army experience. Don’t add your army schools like IBOLC, CCC, air assault school. Maybe add ranger school? Because Im proud of that. Look up how to write a resume, translate your military skills to civilian lingo, have people look it over. Lastly, tailor it to the roles you’re trying to apply to. Don’t know how to? Easy, ask ChatGPT. input the roles you’re looking at and your resume, and ask it to make corrections and tailor it.

-Interviewing: you HAVE to practice. I used ChatGPT/youtube/mentors for mock interviews and potential questions. Importantly, ensure you have a solid, “tell me about yourself”. It’s a 1-2 minute introduction. No more than 2 minutes. Have an interview tracker listing who’ve you interviewed with, status, POC, and DTGs. When you’re scheduling times, keep in mind timezones.

-LinkedIn. I hate LinkedIn too, but it’s a must for recruiting and networking. There’s literal recruiters scanning LinkedIn for potential applicants. Have a professional headshot… not your Army hero photo. Your LinkedIn isn’t your resume, just list your roles and key points. But personalize it. Think of it like a business Facebook. It represents you. Get a year free of LinkedIn premium (for service members) and watch their educational videos on how to set up a LinkedIn. Keep in mind, your interviewer will most likely view your LinkedIn before or after an interview. DEACTIVATE THE VISIBILITY FEATURE!!! Otherwise, when you look at a profile, that person will get a notification that you look at their profile. If you deactivate it, it’ll be anonymous. Lastly! Reach out to talent acquisition people and connect with them! Follow companies you like or applied to. Reach out to former classmates or friends. Network network network. 

-allocate 1-2K just for real civilian clothes and learn how to wear it. Business casual and formal shoes, slacks, chinos, polos, button-ups, suits, ties. It adds up. Don’t buy a cheap $150 Macy’s suit. Nothing more than $800, but first impressions matter.

-apply to grad school (MBA) early! You have your GI Bill, why not use it to detox from army life for two years, get a tremendous education, internships, and networking, and higher income. You still have to try obviously. Use Sitrep to Steerco for MBA resources. They have everything from how to apply to GMAT, essay, interview prep. Then, you can use separate with no worries right into school. For those who are thinking about saving it for your kid… just setup a college plan with the higher income from using your GI Bill.

Hope that helps, maybe I’ll add more later. Time to get off this exercise bike now.

1k9f3h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k9f3h7/aitah_for_giving_my_parents_the_silent_treatment/,AITAH for giving my parents the silent treatment because I wanted to sleep ?,"Hi Reddit, I need your opinion because I don't have many people to ask.
English is not my first language, so excuse any mistakes.

I (18F) live with my parents, my younger sister and my grandmother. Just to put it into context, last year I finished high school and my sister started. Here where we live, high school starts at 7 in the morning. I had to wake up at 5:30 in the morning because my bus was at 6:30. Anyone who has long hair knows how difficult it is to style it. Even so, I set the alarm at the lowest possible volume, woke up quietly, took a shower, had coffee and went to school, all while making as little noise as possible, and I always left my clothes in the living room so I wouldn't have to go into the room and wake up my sister.

This year my sister studies in the morning and I study at night, and I get home late because my school is in another city. I understand that she has to wake up early, just like me, but she doesn't have the same consideration that I had for her. Being from Generation Z, of course she knows how to set the alarm clock, but she's never done that and I've always complained, not to mention that she comes into the room several times and talks to my father, who also wakes up early, in the living room. I complained about the alarm clock noise, but she said that her cell phone couldn't adjust the volume. My father defended her, but after a little discussion, he came to the conclusion that it was better for him to wake her up every day. That hasn't changed much, because she keeps coming into the room all the time and talking to him in the living room. Our bedroom door makes noise and faces the bathroom, and my bed faces the door. She turns on the bathroom light and opens the bedroom door, so the light hits me straight in the face. My mother also wakes up in the morning to work, and even though she has a loud voice, she doesn't make much noise or talk much, just so she doesn't wake me up. My grandmother is also naturally loud and also wakes up early, but she is an almost 80 year old lady, so I don't complain. She also does her best not to make noise, even if it doesn't help much. But my father and sister don't really care and are loud. My father leaves early in the morning, before I get up. When he comes back, he likes to sleep after lunch, and no one can say anything to avoid waking him up. He always complains about my grandmother and even the dogs. We have a lot of dogs and they bark, and my dad doesn't like it. He also always asks me to turn down the volume on the TV, which is ironic because when I woke up early to go to school, I always went to bed early too, and he watched TV with the volume turned up. I remember only once that I asked him to get down because I wanted to sleep. He made an ugly face, but lowered it. However, I heard him telling my sister that I was really annoying for asking that. I forgot to mention before that I have insomnia, and I take sleeping pills, but they don't work, the ones that work leave me completely unmotivated the next day, so I can't always take them, so any loud noise wakes me up easily, but I try not to complain about things that are not in my control, like my grandmother, the dogs and the neighbors.

Now going to the story that made me turn to Reddit, I got my first job at a market close to home, but this job often requires me to wake up early. This Saturday, 04/26, I was scheduled to work the first shift, so I would have to wake up at 6 am. My sister plays in a band and that same day she was going to travel with the band to a distant city, so she had to wake up at 4 in the morning. I went to bed early because on Fridays I have online classes, so it makes it a little easier and I already imagined that I wouldn't sleep much, but when she woke up the noises started, until she took a shower everything was fine, but she came into the room several times, which made me wake up, but I didn't say anything. I went to the bathroom and went back to the bedroom, things got worse when she lost a white sock that was part of her uniform, so she, my father and my mother started talking loudly to each other looking for the sock, they made noise throughout the house, I think they even woke up my grandmother. Their argument lasted until around 4:30 in the morning, when they found another white sock for her. I woke up, clearly, in a bad mood, when my father looked at me and said that I couldn't be in a bad mood because I had been waking up early for three years and no one had complained. I was very angry. I don't usually argue with my father, but I said that I had reasons to be angry, because when I woke up early I didn't make as much noise and didn't talk to others, and my sister didn't have to wake up early the next day to work, because she studied in the afternoon. My father just looked at me with a mocking face and went to take my sister to the band to catch the bus. It was almost 5 am and because of my insomnia I couldn't sleep. 

I needed to rest because, even though it's part time, from 7 am to 1:30 pm, it's still a tiring job, because there I deal with sales and customer service. I barely have time to sit down and I always have to do calculations and keep the environment clean. I was so frustrated that I couldn't sleep and I ended up crying. My mother heard my crying and came to ask me. I explained, but she didn't understand. She said that I was being spoiled, that my sister had lost her sock and needed to find it, I said that I had to work, but she told me that it wasn't for that long, that I could rest at that moment, but it was almost 6 in the morning and I wouldn't be able to sleep, and she knew that, so I got up, since I couldn't sleep, took a shower and went to work. When I got there, I had a huge headache from sleep and my thinking was very slow. When it was time to change shifts with my colleague, I counted the money with great difficulty and got home only thinking about sleeping. When I got home, my boss texted me saying I had counted the money wrong, which worried me. He also said that I had forgotten the money that was put on the card, and I really did. He told me that the money in the till had made a difference and that my colleague was counting again. I told him it wouldn't happen again, even though he's a great boss, miscounting the money in the register could cause problems for both me and him. I said I wouldn't let it happen again. I think he understood, but I don't know if I'll be able to keep my job because of this. I was so overwhelmed on Saturday that I barely spoke to my dad. I was supposed to work today, Sunday, I'm writing this, but my boss didn't call me, which makes me worried and even more frustrated. I'm angry with my father and I still can't talk to him, he doesn't talk to me either, but I know that in a few days he will talk to me again as if nothing had happened, he always does that. As for my mother, I'm also hurt by her, she tries to talk to me, I respond, but I don't continue the conversation. I'm seriously scared of losing my job.

I'm seriously wondering if I'm the asshole for giving them both the silent treatment because I feel bad about it. My mother is asking me if I'm sick for not leaving my room, as if she had forgotten why I was like this, but at the same time she saw me crying and knows that I felt bad, but my father doesn't even look at my face.

I’ve been in IT for 17+ years now, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that security often gets overlooked — especially by content creators who are busy doing what they love. In the last few years I have heard more and more stories of creators having accounts hacked and then it happened to a Tech reviewer that I follow in youtube. So recently I decided to take action.


Over the past few months, I’ve been working hard behind the scenes on something I’m really passionate about: a video-based learning course called SecureStream Essentials. It's designed to be simple, engaging, and beginner-friendly — no tech jargon, no lectures — just practical steps creators can use to better protect their accounts, devices, and content.

I priced it around the cost of a cup of coffee, because honestly, my goal wasn’t to make a huge profit — I just wanted it to be accessible for everyone who needs it.

If you’re a creator, or know someone who is, I’d love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions about online security.

(If you want to check it out, here’s the link: https://store.securestreamessentials.com/b/evu7O) — but whether you do or not, please just take this as a reminder: your content is valuable. Your online presence is valuable. Taking a few steps to protect it now can save you from a lot of heartache later.

Stay safe, keep creating, and if you have any security questions — big or small — I'm happy to help.",1,1745789382.0,creators,2,1.0,False

Scaling back to a leaner format—the last one felt too yarr, ya. Thank you for accompanying me on this quest through the dark recesses of *The Dystonomicon*, including: the indulgent poetry, the fourth wall breaking, the sprawling essays, and the more modest definitions.

It was relief to finish *Life in Nazi Germany, Nazi Economics,* and *U.S. War Economics*—they’ve been on the workbench since December.

I’ve never stuck with a personal writing project this long, fiction or non-fiction. But this one pulls me in—moth to flame. I feel like I can keep doing this, even though the task seems endless. Late nights and early mornings, typing until the words blur. I reread some of the older stuff—posted or kept hidden in the master file—and wonder: who is this maniac publicly playing a 1980s Sisyphus-themed text adventure game? Endlessly rolling a boulder around in a dark dungeon... ""*You are likely to be eaten by a grue.""* 

How far can I safely push this? More coffee? Less whiskey? Or the other way around? I already feel like I’m splitting. Maybe I’ll catch a glimpse in the mirror of the dark self. The Dystonomicon as personal demonology? Maybe I should get more sleep. I never wanted a split personality. But if they can finish the workload, they're welcome to the body.

Itinerary:



**Friday**

drive up from DC

lunch at leeward market

2pm naval academy walking tour

4pm naval academy parade

5:30 drinks/dinner at Davis’ pub

7pm naval academy drum and bugle corps spring concert

Annapolis Ice Cream Company



**Saturday**

breakfast at hotel

william paca house guided tour and gardens

lunch at the goat

Hogshead - colonial games 

walked around City dock - boat show going on

walked up main street, reclaimed annapolis & other shops

state house (not a tour but some exhibits, spent \~30 mins going through it)

old fox bookstore & cafe

antiquing & record store on Maryland ave strip

galway bay irish pub - drink

Beer at Forward Brewing while waiting for table

dinner at Boatyard Bar & Grill 

live music and dancing at Middleton Tavern



**Sunday**:

breakfast at hotel

watermark 40 min cruise

49 west coffeehouse - coffee and snack

street festival happening, so strolled and listened to some live music

drive back to DC



Parking:

* found a spot on King George St while we had our walking tour. but you can only pay for 2 hrs of parking and it won’t let you add more time. we decided to risk it and stayed an hour and a half after the timer expired and didn’t get a ticket. 
* for the rest of the weekend we just parked in the calvert street garage (free after 6pm on fridays and all day sat/sunday). about a 10-15 min walk from downtown. was great on saturday when got to down at 10:30am and left after midnight!
* no problem to find street parking in eastport 



Thoughts: 

* Food: 
   * every meal here was incredible. We specifically wanted to get great crab cakes, and **Davis Pub** and **Boatyard bar & grill** didn’t disappoint. Davis is more divey and gritty but in a charming way, lots of locals. Boatyard is well-decorated and lively interior. Both places had INCREDIBLE crab cakes. highly highly highly recommend. 
   * **Leeward market** was the BEST place for a quick lunch before the naval academy tour - had sandwiches and salads and we also had a slice of the smith island cake! quick service and good indoor and outdoor seating.
   * **The Goat** was a good place for lunch close to the center of town. really good execution, shared a few things and their shrimp cesear was very generous with shrimp (and big shrimp!) so we loved that!
   * Coming from DC, food and drink prices were very affordable. Partially because we didn’t go anywhere fancy, but even getting the market price for crab cakes wasn’t too expensive.  
* Coffee:
   * **49 west coffeehouse** was perfect for mid morning coffee and snack - cool/funky interior, worth the small walk from the center of town!
* William Paca house 
   * guided tour was great, interesting history and insight into the Paca family. also a small museum. discount for AARP/teachers/seniors.
* Live Music
   * was trying to find live music on Saturday, but it was limited before 9am. ended up getting drinks and then dinner. had seen that **Middleton Tavern** had a piano bar and other live music, so my parents and I went there. The piano bar upstairs definitely had a younger more rowdy crowd so it wasn’t really the vibe, but downstairs had a fantastic band singing mostly oldies and the crowd had a good age range. my dad had a fun time talking to some midshipmen but after midnight the crowd was mostly 50+ and was still a great time! 
* While the center of Annapolis is cute, Eastport and West Annapolis were great to get into. much more local vibe. 
* Check the naval academy events calendar!!! we happened to be in town when the drum and bugle corps was having their spring concert, so I knew we would go to that, and the tour guide also told us about the parade that was happening at 4pm. both events were amazing and very fun to see. 

other things on my list that we didn’t get to:

* annapolis maritime museum
* naval academy museum (had a few mins to browse before the parade but could have spent a lot more time there)
* naval academy chapel / john paul jones crypt (closed for a wedding rehearsal on friday afternoon)

1k9ezbp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9ezbp,Rate my pour over and how to get more ‘tea like’ coffee,"Hello! I’m seeking some advice on my pour over grinds, which look a bit too much like sludge for me (see pictures). Im not too pedantic about my method so this one was around 14.8g with 330g of water over 4 minutes brew time on a hario v60. Most of my pours are like this give or take a bit.

How can I get my grinds to be less sludgy, and also how can I get my coffee to turn out less black and more tea like? I’ve noticed when I go to nice cafes that have pour over, their coffee is more tea-like and has a lighter texture than the one I brew at home. Another characteristic is the coffee there is typically less dark and more light colored (which I presume contributes to the tea like attributes). Thanks! Any other advice is also welcome :)

""It’s not just an OS, it’s a way of life."" Even my wife was supportive: ""Didn't you say you wanted more control over your system?"" That was the last time she looked at me with hope.

I didn’t choose Ubuntu or Fedora like a sane person. No, I chose NixOS — as if I wanted to watch my marriage collapse in real-time. The first day, I spent 12 hours writing a configuration.nix just to get Wi-Fi working. When my wife brought dinner, I waved her off: ""I’m just setting up a declarative Bluetooth module, it’ll only take a minute...""

She asked if we could go hiking over the weekend. ""Sure,"" I said, ""right after I finish setting up home-manager and figuring out why my shell isn't reproducible."" That was three weeks ago.

She tried everything to pull me out. ""Let’s go for a coffee,"" she said. ""Sorry, I’m debugging why my system rebuild keeps pulling a different glibc version."" ""Maybe just watch a movie together?"" ""Good idea! First I need to package mpv myself, I don't trust the default derivation...""

Then came the final blow: One night, she found me at 3 a.m., half-naked, whispering into the void: ""If I can just get this flake to build... I can declare our entire marriage in a flake.nix...""

She stared at me — a broken man surrounded by YAML, JSON, and cryptic build errors. ""I married a person, not a package manager."" she said.

She left a sticky note on the monitor: ""I’m going to find someone who just uses Arch. They might be unstable, but at least they notice when I'm in the room.""

This will be longer one just to warn you.

So at beginning of month I got into new job and I was assinged to female colleague to show me things around.

And I feel that she is behaving to mee too personal.

At first she stated that I have to stay on her shift no matter what and then it started.
It all looked like just fun when she started calling me ""love"" in work, she brought me (only me not other colleagues) breakfast, other day again only to me she brought lunch (without me knowing or asking for it).
After 2 weeks she started calling me to come to coffee and that we will go see another shift (where her best friend works) and of course it ended that it was only her and me on that coffee without ever visiting other shift. 
Few days later she asked me to come to her come for coffee at morning before work. 
Then we had chat about cooking while we were in book and I mentioned that I love to make rissoto and she literally asked me that she wouldnt mind if I came to her place to teach her to cook and is already plannig dinners and drinks together withou even asking me.
Today she asked to start going together to gym.

We know each other for like 3 weeks and she already told me about her serious health condition, that she can't have kids, that she has depression and is visiting therapist and even that she attemted suicide.

The thing is that she knows I'm married man and she even asked that we can go out together with her but suddenly calls me out solo. 
She was telling me that she ended long termín realtionship that was toxic and now is in new one for 1 month but she is constantly talking to me about bad things and that she dont know if she can handle it anymore. 

When there was her friend at our shift she started talking (as joke) that I should dvorce and take her while she is often talking that ""men like you and married... what a shame""

I brought today breakfast to work and she took it and make photo of it and sending it to her boyfriend with words, that foreign men takes better care of me than you. 

I don't know what to think about it as new guy in work I dont want to get into truhle. 
My opinions are; 

1. She is unhappy in her realtionship and is looking for mental support 

2. She is just friendly and thats how she behave if she likes somebody 

3. She want to make her current bf jelaous 

4. After toxic relationship she is looking for somebody to fill gap (people are telling me often that I'm too nice to others and that that's my problem that I want to help others and she is feeling it.)

1k9escg,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1k9escg/dull_men_of_britain/,Dull Men Of Britain,"Hi, this is the first chapter of a book i am currently writing (50,000 words roughly give or take..) if you could let me know what you think that would be wonderful. 

  
The brief synopsis of the book is this : After graduating from university and falling into a hollow, repetitive life, a disillusioned young man stumbles across an online forum, ""Dull Men of Great Britain,"" where men obsessively document their small, peculiar routines. Intrigued, he sets out to meet them — men like Gerald, who waters his plants at exactly 7:14 PM, Dennis, who walks the same 3.2-mile route daily, and Clive, who collects broken clocks as a quiet rebellion against time. As he cycles from town to town across England, meeting men whose rituals are rooted in grief, control, or simple survival, the narrator slowly realizes that his journey is not about studying them — it’s about understanding himself. Each encounter reveals how rituals, even the most mundane, can create meaning in a chaotic world. By the end, the line between the ""dull men"" and the narrator blurs entirely: their routines, once subjects of study, mirror his own search for stability, belonging, and purpose.

  
Chapter one

Sunlight fell across my desk in a way that could only be read as accusatory. It said that 12:30pm was no time to wake up and face the day. I felt differently. It landed squarely on a crusted-over teaspoon and the topmost book in the pile: *The Power of Now*, unread since October. It will stay that way. The sunlight cast long shadows across the empty mugs and piled books that had taken over the small confines of my flat. Penicillin was blossoming in half of the used mugs. One day I will clean them but it doesn’t appear high on the list of my priorities, slightly below setting fire to my own hair. I'd begun classifying the mould varieties – the speckled ochre growth on the Costa Coffee cup suggested late November's damp, while the velvety grey fuzz erupting from the National Trust commemorative mug likely coincided with that bleak stretch post-Christmas. Even the charity shops looked tired then. A thin layer of dust had settled over everything. I counted the particles up to one hundred and then gave up. A fruitless exercise. The books stood guard by the radiator in critical piles. A deflated penguin peered up from the spine of Orwell's collected essays, bookmark stranded on page 112 where I'd abandoned my proletariat phase. The complete works of Jung gathered dust at a 23° angle – precisely the tilt required to prevent the spine creasing that had consumed forty-seven minutes of last October. My attempts at self-betterment fossilised in cellulose and cracked glue.

I sat, as I often did, in the centre of what could generously be called a living room—though not much living occurred within it. The flat was neither large nor particularly well-appointed, but it sufficed for one who had managed to shrink his existence into a single room. Here, a noble collection of half-read novels. Nearby, postcards from people enjoying life more convincingly than I ever had. And in one corner, a stack of marked essays—remnants of academic triumphs now as relevant as the remains of a buffet after a wedding. Unopened envelopes littered the table - letters from the student loan company, the gym I'd quit attending three months into a yearlong contract, a bank that kept sending me offers for credit cards I didn't want.  It was a space that spoke more of absence than presence. The furnishings were sparse, utilitarian - a futon that served as both bed and sofa, a rickety table propped up by a folded bit of cardboard under one leg, a single wooden chair that spent more time holding piles of laundry than supporting any human form. Like most things here it was more burdened than used.

At night, the postcard shifted. Not literally, of course, but its Cornish coastal scene seemed to migrate behind the key bowl through some trick of weary perception. Five classmates grinned eternally beneath the legend ""St. Ives Arts Weekend 2018!"", their elbows eternally propped on the rail of a gallery I'd pretended to visit. The keys themselves had multiplied – seven Yale, two Chubb, a defunct NUS card – but none seemed to fit anything beyond the flat's own stubborn locks.

The radiator coughed. Not a metaphorical cough, but the actual wet gurgle of air trapped in Victorian pipes. I'd come to recognise its vocabulary – the sharp clang at 3:17 AM meant incoming struggle and the midday hiss signalled creeping agoraphobia. We'd developed an understanding, that radiator and I. It withheld heat; I withheld cleaning.

In the kitchen, the kettle sat cold and waiting. I filled it to the usual level, watching the water slosh against the metal sides before setting it back on its base and flicking the switch. The familiar click-click-hummmm filled the air as the coils began to heat, and I counted silently in my head, waiting.  The kettle's second click arrived with papal infallibility, its steam rising through sunrise stripes like a mechanized thurible. I measured my existence in these intervals - the 122 seconds between switch flick and salvation, each millisecond variance logged in the crater of my brain.

I could recite the steps like liturgy:

1. Boil to second click (never first - that plaintive whine of half-hearted commitment)

2. Two heaped teaspoons of ASDA Smart Price instant (2018 batch - the 2021 formulation lacked gravelly texture)

3. Precisely 237ml water (checked via NHS prescription measuring cup)

4. Stir 14 times clockwise (widdershins provoked mild arrhythmia)

The ritual had crystallized during that terrible fortnight after graduation when time melted into a viscous pool. I'd discovered the superiority of clockwise during The Great Stirring Schism of '22 - a 37-hour caffeine bender testing spiral vs. concentric methods. The data proved incontrovertible: clockwise dissolution prevented dreaded powder archipelagos. Today, however, I decided I needed a new kettle. There were 124 seconds between switch flick and salvation. Nothing must interrupt the routine.

Four steps to the bathroom. Not three. Not five. Four. My feet knew each floor fissure:

Step 1: Clear rug island (navy polypropylene, IKEA 2023)

Step 2: Navigate Book Sinai (Proust vol.2 bisected by walking path)

Step 3: Avoid Death Tile (loose ceramic shard from last weeks Mug Incident. New step.)

Step 4: Palm the doorframe (chip at 172cm height from an ill-advised dartboard phase)

Toothbrush, toothpaste, the ritual scrubbing. Rinse, spit, wipe. Face splashed with water just shy of freezing, the shock of it chasing away any lingering fuzziness. Towel, patted dry, folded and replaced on the rack.

The pens awaited inspection on return. Three pens lay in perfect parallel, equidistant from each other. Blue, black, red. Lined up like soldiers awaiting orders. I couldn't remember the last time I'd actually used them for anything more than this morning ceremony, but still, I straightened them each day, taking a strange solace in the small act of control. The blue pen had roughly 87% ink remaining. A newer purchase. Reliable. Will need to use it more so it doesn’t feel left out. The black was at 62%, a workhorse of a pen. The red was at 34%, used for highlighting amounts left on student loans and overdraft fees.

The flat was quiet, as it ever was. Outside, the distant hum of traffic ebbed and flowed like a half-heard conversation, punctuated occasionally by the bark of a dog or the slam of a car door. Inside, the silence was broken only by the soft creaks of the old building settling into itself, the aged joists and beams sighing like weary bones. The radiator cleared its throat, a bronchial rattle that meant “You’ve lingered too long.” I adjusted red pen by 3° west. The world held its breath. Nothing changed.

The evenings were when the restlessness set in. As the sun dipped below the horizon and the shadows stretched across the floor like spilled ink, I would find myself gravitating towards the cold glow of my laptop screen, as if drawn to a song only I could hear. This, too, had become a routine: endless scrolling through news sites, job listings, social media feeds that served only to reinforce a sense of distance from the world and its events. I opened too many tabs, closed them with no more certainty than when I had opened them, and repeated the cycle with the kind of resigned persistence one might reserve for the washing-up or the bins. Tonight the tabs metastasised in digital mitosis. There were fourteen job portals which all required *passion for innovation* and *Excel proficiency.* Seven tabs with abandoned baskets. I could not decide on a new kettle. I had paused at the payment page at John Lewis. Such big decisions needed more time. Niche forums dedicated to topics I had no real interest in - vintage typewriter maintenance, the mating habits of obscure beetle species, conspiracy theories about the origins of the Oxford comma. And always, the Wikipedia rabbit holes. A stray thought would snag on a word or a phrase, and before I knew it, I would be seven pages deep into the history of lighthouse construction, or the biography of some minor 18th century aristocrat, my brain stuffed with facts I would never have cause to use. One job description I had kept open required five years’ experience in medieval codicology, to be fluent in Latin, Old English and Excel, and demanded that I could thrive in fast paced environments. Of course I could, the morning kettle ritual was the peak of fast paced. The salary was £21,000 with no London weighting (not applicable).

I composed treatises that would go nowhere. The 14,000 words in my Eddystone Lighthouse document were desperate to be added to. I checked the references were in the required format (Harvard style). They were. I was unsure about the middle 2,000 words. I felt as if they were superfluous. The bibliography was a masterpiece. It included 18^(th) century tide charts and 2003 GeoCities page.  This could be my finest work yet. I saved it into the swelling lighthouse folder on my desktop.

Time slipped with an insidiousness that comes from staring at a digital clock, each minute a testament to time passing but not progressing. I attempted to impose a kind of logic upon my browsing, alternating between productivity and distraction, but found it difficult to discern where one ended and the other began. The laptop fan whined like a distant train but one that was in pain. It was dying. Like everything else. The screen began to burn afterimages into my retinas. Phantom menus floated across the pizza box fossilising on the carpet. Somewhere beneath the takeaway debris lay my notebook, its last entry three weeks old and concerning entirely the optimal shelving of tinned soups.

By 9:37pm I'd developed a system. Each browser tab represented a possible future self-glimmering in the digital murk. Here, the me who finally replied to LinkedIn connections (""Congratulations on your promotion, though I can't for the life of me recall your face""). There, the me engrossed in a 114-page thesis comparing Victorian streetlamp designs to circadian rhythms. That particular PDF had cost me £8.50 through an academic portal, charged to a credit card I might not even own anymore. Suddenly, Dr. Ellsworth’s voice intruded: “Your methodology is admirably rigorous, but one wonders if categorising every 19th-century cab driver in Leeds isn't rather... circumscribed?” I nearly spilled Asda coffee granules onto yesterday’s socks.

 Somewhere around midnight, I discovered the lighthouse keepers' guild forum. Men with handles like WickTrimmer1962 debated wick-trimming intervals like Talmudic scholars. Their jargon mesmerized - hyperradiant Fresnel lenses, occulting patterns, mercury bath repairs. For 73 uninterrupted minutes, I absorbed the intricacies of maintaining a 1903 Chance Brothers lantern. My back teeth ached from clenching. When I finally looked up, the browser's clock read 1:14am, and my left foot had gone numb from being tucked under my thigh in the exact posture I'd sustained through final exams.

I had started off researching the history of the ballpoint pen - a noble endeavour, to be sure - but had somehow ended up on a page dedicated to vintage bubble gum wrappers, my cursor hovering over an embedded link titled ""The Peculiar Appeal of the Mundane."" One click, and I was tumbling down yet another rabbit hole. This one led to a forum, buried deep within the forgotten recesses of the internet. ""The Dull Men of Great Britain,"" the header proclaimed in a font that looked like it hadn't been updated since the days of dial-up modems and AOL chat rooms.

At first glance, the layout was almost charmingly retro, all clunky graphics and rudimentary HTML. The threads, displayed in a simple list format, bore titles that seemed to compete for the crown of most banal. ""The Repainting of Grit Bins - Spring 2022 Edition,"" one announced, alongside a blurry photograph of what appeared to be a small yellow container on a street corner. ""UK's Roundabout of the Year,"" another declared, accompanied by a dizzying collage of aerial shots depicting various circular intersections. ""Traffic Cone Spotting: Norfolk vs. Lincolnshire,"" a third enthused, the header adorned with a clip-art illustration of a stylized orange cone.

My laugh came out as more of a nasal exhale, fogging the screen. The forum threads read like a particularly sedate Radio 4 schedule:

\*""Best Practices for Bus Shelter Mural Preservation (vandalism considerations)""

""Show Us Your Sponsored Roundabout Flowerbed!""

""Official 2022 Benchmarking of Public Toilet Hand Dryer Decibel Levels""\*

Some people had too much time on their hands.

I clicked ""View More"" with the clinical detachment of a sociologist studying cults. The usernames alone were a study in absurdity: ConeZone94, BinManBarry, RoundaboutRick. One prolific poster, operating under the enigmatic moniker of ""SconeLover62,"" had apparently made it his life's mission to catalogue and rate every garden centre in Kent based on the perceived softness of their scones. Another, the self-styled ""EggManEd,"" documented the daily temperature decay of boiled eggs left to languish on his windowsill, complete with meticulously annotated graphs and charts. I bookmarked the egg chart. For research, obviously.

To my surprise, or perhaps enjoyment, there was more. User BinManBarry opened with: ""Re: Spring 2022 Grit Bin Rollout - The Durham contingent continues with Dulux Weathershield 'Hedge Maze' (BS4800:00A09). Lincolnshire's switch to 'Parsley Butter' must be CONTESTED."" Seven replies followed, including attachments from the Highways Agency handbook. My mouse hovered over the ""Join Discussion"" button. The radiator gurgled its disapproval.

By 1:46am, I'd mapped members by avatar. Rotary clotheslines dominated the over-60s contingent. Younger posters favoured council logo watermarks. A thread titled ""Optimal Leaf Collection Cadence - Experience from Bracknell"" contained shockingly elegant diagrams. When I found myself nodding along to a debate about heritage lamppost restoration grants, the realisation hit with the force of a misjudged speed bump - these weren't eccentrics. These were professionals. The street outside echoed with Friday night stragglers. Their laughter sliced through the double glazing as I studied a photo essay on concrete bollard weathering patterns. Someone had captioned a moss-flecked specimen outside Bury St Edmunds Sainsbury's: ""Fig. 1 - Splendid patina development since 2018 relocations"". My toes curled in their M&S socks. Whether in horror or admiration, I couldn't say.

At 2:03am, discovered the ""Projects"" subforum. Sixteen pages documented a member's quest to catalogue every Tesco car park gradient in Yorkshire. Scrolling became hypnosis - each post a perfectly squared-off brick in some vast municipal edifice of tedium. When the bathroom pipes shuddered awake upstairs, I startled like a teenager caught with a naughty website open, slamming the laptop shut. The afterglow of the screen lingered in geometric patterns behind my eyelids - forum headings burned into my optic nerves like canal boat registry numbers.

My finger hovered over the trackpad, the cursor blinking expectantly. I knew I should close the tab, return to my aimless scrolling, my fruitless search for distraction. But instead, almost without thinking, I found myself clicking on the ""New User Registration"" button, a strange sense of anticipation fluttering in my chest.

Perhaps, I thought, as I began to fill in the requisite fields, there was something to be learned from the dull men and their quiet enthusiasms. Perhaps, in the grand scheme of things, there was a certain nobility to be found in the embrace of the unremarkable, the celebration of the mundane.

Or perhaps I was just tired, my judgment clouded by the late hour and the endless blue light of the screen. Either way, as I typed out my new username - ""PenMan87,"" a nod to my earlier ballpoint rabbit hole - I couldn't help but feel a small thrill of something that might have been belonging, or at least the tentative promise of it.

I typically just eat at my coffee table and I don't work from home so I'm thinking I can throw my dining table in the office space to have more living area to work with.

the biggest problems I am having is the narrow shape of the room and the entryway to the ""office"" area being where it is. I don't think the layout in the floorplan provided is the best, I would most likely flip the tv to the other wall. if no one can come up with any good ideas I may have to let this one go, even if it is a good deal (presumably because of the shape)

provided are photos from the leasing agent including a floorplan. I've also included a rough mock up of my current living room (2 couches, coffee and end tables, tv, bookshelf, and dining table)

Three years ago I came off a prescription drug for sleep called Mirtazapine. I had HORRENDOUS WD symptoms and it messed up my body for a few years. I’m starting to finally feel back to myself again. I felt like it messed up my nervous system. 

Now, caffeine really bothers me. Whenever I go without caffeine I feel so much better. Sometimes I treat myself to a coffee, like today. I got a 1/3 caffeine coffee from Starbucks and I felt like I wanted to race out of my body. My thoughts get wild, like intrusive. I feel like I’m plugged into an electric socket. 

I understand I can live without caffeine and I’ll accept that if I must. However, I know some of you understand the feeling of being able to participate in some coffee or tea in the morning or a Diet Coke run. So, my hope is that, some day soon my body will allow me to have it again. 

I guess this post is about… has anyone else gone through sometime like this? Where your body doesn’t handle caffeine like it use to? Do you know what changed? Do you think it’s a nervous system issue? ",2,1745788602.0,Biohackers,7,1.0,False

He's a great guy most of the time, but sometimes he has this ""nothing is ever that serious"" attitude that drives me crazy.

We planned a vacation together for months — my first time leaving the country! I was beyond excited. I triple-checked all our plans, flights, hotels, passports, etc. He kept teasing me about how ""uptight"" I was being, but I just brushed it off.

The day of our flight, we were running a little behind because he insisted we stop for coffee *""real quick""*, even though I said multiple times we were already cutting it close. He laughed and said, *""Flights never leave on time anyway.""*

By the time we got to the airport, it was pure chaos. Security lines were insane. I begged him to hurry, but he kept joking around, stopping to look at snacks, and even taking selfies in the terminal. I was furious but trying to keep it together.

When we finally got to our gate, the doors had JUST closed. We missed boarding by literally **five minutes**.

I broke down crying right there. He tried to hug me and said, *""Babe, relax, we'll get on the next one.""* — like it was no big deal. Except the next flight was sold out, and the earliest we could fly would have been two days later. Not to mention, we would lose our hotel reservation.

I was so upset I told him I needed a minute and just... left. I called an Uber, went back to my place, and didn’t talk to him for the rest of the day.

Now he’s blowing up my phone saying I abandoned him at the airport and ruined our trip by “overreacting.” He says it’s *my fault* for being so ""high-strung"" and that if I had ""just relaxed,"" we could've still had fun.

Part of me feels guilty for leaving him there alone... but also??? I told him a million times we were late. I feel like he just didn’t take anything seriously until it was too late.

So, AITA for walking out after we missed our flight?",83,1745788569.0,AITAH,105,0.9,False

Anyway, it was really my fault why it happened. Coffee (caffeine in general but coffee is the worst) is my biggest trigger for acid reflux and I don't regularly drink it anymore but I got some when my brother ordered in Starbucks after lunch, it was the Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew btw. At first, I didn't feel much symptoms when I got home, just a few burps here and there so I took the Gaviscon chewables. I didn't eat dinner because I felt bloated and gassy but I tried to eat crackers so my stomach won't be empty.

As the night progressed, my burps got worse and I started feeling more nauseous so I tried to even out my breath and relax but then it came up but I swallowed it back down. I felt a bit better than before so I immediately drank Bonamine aka our version of Dramamine in our country I think, and tried to relax a bit. After a while, my stomach started hurting again and a bit worse this time to I tried to just rest on my chair with my eyes closed. As I felt myself nodding off, I thought my condition was better so I got up and started fixing my stuff for work but I guess I moved too quickly so my stomach pain and nausea appeared again and a bit faster now.

So I rushed to the bathroom and it happened twice, one was more mucus and the other was the real thing. I felt terrified before it happened but I felt waaaay better afterwards.

It's been 2 hours since it happened and I'm trying to fall back asleep but it feels like there's still something in my throat and my stomach pain is going in and out. So I went to our kitchen to eat a bit more crackers so my stomach won't be empty and I drank a bit more water.

Should I drink the liquid Gaviscon or just try to rest? I'm just scared that I'll suddenly wake up needing to do it and I won't make it in time for the toilet.

For me I was fortunate enough to find that and specifically for my trans, non binary and asexual friends I have always been very protective of them because there are some ignorant ass people in the world. VERY recently I have been talking to a really handsome trans guy after we met at our mutual friends birthday party, we totally hit it off right away he was charming, really funny and we were really vibing the whole night. So we have been chatting a lot and had coffee yesterday. He also came out to me as trans today and when he did he seemed very nervous and basically said he would still like to keep talking regardless of whether I was okay with it or not in a romantic way. It was such a weird emotion to feel because IN MY HEAD I thought ""dude if you think that id stop liking you because of that is CRAZY"" but I know how people are, and not everyone has those same thoughts, sadly. But instead I told him that would never be a problem for me and that I liked him and wanted to keep seeing where this would go. 

It then kind of hit me that I never had a romantic relationship with a trans guy, like I have some gay trans male friends but none have ever hit on me or pursued me in that way before or I them, I suppose. So sorry for the huge backstory but I just dont want to say something to offend him by accident or trigger any sort of dysphoria he may have. Yeah Im sure I could go to my trans friends and lay it out there and ask but I dont know... I think I need some starting points and opinions before I ask any of them.. 

I think im scared for them to see me as ignorant and I dont want any of them to think negatively of me for asking any sort of questions because I feel like I should know this?

1k9ene8,https://i.redd.it/4f8zj3r11gxe1.jpeg,How I Reclaimed 60 Minutes Every Day By Fixing My News Consumption Habit,"Hey everyone. Let me share a productivity breakthrough I had recently.

A few months ago, I realized I was spending over an hour every day consuming news - jumping between news apps, social media feeds, and various websites. I'd start with ""just checking headlines"" and suddenly 70+ minutes would vanish. Sound familiar?

I'm a developer, so I decided to build a solution for myself: a minimalist daily news brief ([skimz](https://skimz.ai)) that gives me all essential news in exactly 10 minutes each morning.

The core concept:

* Curated executive summaries across markets, global affairs, tech, and health
* Skimmable format instead of infinite scroll
* Source citations (transparency without the research rabbit hole)
* No algorithms pushing content based on engagement

The results have been transformative for my productivity. I'm just as informed, but I've gained back nearly an hour daily for deep work. My morning routine is now much more intentional - I get my news briefing with coffee, then move straight into my most important tasks without that ""scattered"" feeling news consumption often creates.

For anyone struggling with news-related procrastination or feeling overwhelmed by the 24/7 news cycle, I highly recommend building a more intentional approach to staying informed.

Would love to hear if others have found ways to optimize their information consumption habits!",1,1745788347.0,ProductivityGeeks,0,1.0,False
1k9en9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1k9en9n/cant_eat_all_day/,Can’t eat all day,"
I was diagnosed with SIBO about a month ago after struggling with it since October.  Everything I eat gives me horrible diarrhea and makes my intestines churn and pop and feel so bloated and painful.  I did two weeks of rifaximin.  Did not make any difference.  I no longer eat at work at all because of this, it makes it too hard to get through the day.  I drink one coffee at 5:30am and besides that I don’t eat till 5:30pm every workday.  It’s so hard to get through the days.  This past Friday my boyfriend wanted to go to the movies in  the evening and then spend the night.  I felt nervous to eat so I didn’t eat at all that day except that one coffee and water.  It’s a very hard way to live.  I’m constantly hungry and weak and tired but the alternative is in the bathroom in a lot of pain.  My GI doctor seems perplexed and told me to try eating gluten free.  That also makes no difference.  Any advice on what could get rid of this? ",0,1745788337.0,SIBO,3,0.5,False

----------------------------------------------------

Many people think about **starting a business** in web design. They see others succeed. But they worry. Is it too hard? Maybe they think they do not have enough skill or money. This feeling is common. The path looks difficult. Lots of competition exists. It can feel like a big risk.

This guide helps you. We want to show you the steps. You can learn how to build a **web design agency** or work as a **freelance web designer**. It is possible to make it profitable. We will talk about important things. Checking your skills is first. Then, making a good plan. Building a **portfolio website** comes next. After that, finding clients. Finally, how to charge money and keep clients happy. This guide gives you a clear map.

I. Checking Your Skills and Finding Your Place
----------------------------------------------

### A. Know Your Skills Now

First, look at what you can do well. Are you good at making websites look nice? This is design skill. Can you write the code that makes websites work? This is development skill. Maybe you understand how people use websites easily. This is **user experience (UX)** and **user interface (UI)** skill. Do you know how to make websites show up on Google? This is **search engine optimization (SEO)** skill.

Be honest. What are you very good at? Where do you need to learn more? Make a list. Knowing your strong points helps you start. Knowing weak points shows you where to improve. This is a first step for any **small business owner**.

### B. Choose a Special Area (Niche)

Trying to design websites for everyone is hard. Many people do this. It is better to choose a special group or type of website. This is called finding your **niche market**. Why do this? Research shows businesses that specialize often make more money. Clients see them as experts. There is less competition in a small area.

What kind of niche can you choose? Maybe you like making online shops (**e-commerce**). Perhaps you want to help charities (**non-profits**). You could focus on businesses near you (**local businesses**). Or choose one type of work, like websites for restaurants or doctors. Think about what you like and who needs help. This focus makes your business stronger.

### C. Learn More Skills

Web design changes fast. New tools and ideas come always. You must keep learning. Look at your skill list from before. Where did you need help? Find ways to get better. Many websites offer courses. Udemy and Coursera have many classes on design, coding, and **SEO**. Special schools called bootcamps teach intense **web development skills**.

Spending time and maybe some money on learning is important. It helps you do better work. It helps you offer new services. Good skills make clients trust you more. Continuous learning is key for **entrepreneurship** in technology fields.

II. Making a Strong Business Plan
---------------------------------

### A. Choose Your Business Type

You need a legal structure for your business. A **Sole Proprietorship** is simple. You and the business are one. An **LLC (Limited Liability Company)** separates your personal things from business debts. This offers some protection. A **Corporation** is more complex, often for bigger companies. Each has good and bad points. Think about taxes and legal risks.

You also need a business name. Make sure no one else uses it. You might need to register this name. Depending on where you live, you may need special business licenses or permits. Check your local government rules for **starting a business**.

### B. Know Your Ideal Client

Who do you want to work for? Think about your **niche market**. Describe your perfect client in detail. What industry are they in? How big is their business? Where are they located? What problems do they have that a website can solve? This is your **target audience**.

Find information to support your choice. Look for data showing growth in certain industries. *Statistics show that sectors like healthcare technology and sustainable goods are growing fast and need strong online presences*. Understanding your client helps you find them and talk to them effectively.

### C. Plan Your Money

**Starting a business** needs money. Make a list of startup costs. You need good software for design and development. You need a reliable computer. You might spend money on marketing. Calculate these costs. This is your startup budget.

Decide how to charge for your work. Will you charge by the hour? Or charge a fixed price for each project? Research what other designers charge in your area or niche. Give a range, maybe $50 to $150 per hour, or $1,500 to $10,000 per project, depending on complexity and your experience. These are just examples; research actual rates. This is part of your **pricing models**.

Try to predict your income and costs for the first year. Will you make enough money? *The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers resources showing average startup costs and revenue expectations for service businesses like web design*. Planning helps you see if your business idea can work financially.

III. Showing Your Work and Being Seen Online
--------------------------------------------

### A. Make Sample Projects

If you have no past clients, you need to show what you can do. Create website designs for imaginary clients. Pick different industries to show variety. Make a design for a local coffee shop, a tech startup, or a personal blog.

Another way is to offer help for free or cheap. Ask friends or family if they need a website. Find a local non-profit organization. They often need help but have little money. Doing this gives you real experience. You can add these projects to your portfolio. Ask them for **client testimonials** if they are happy.

### B. Build Your Own Website

Your business needs its own professional website. This is very important. It is your online shop window. Here, you show off your skills. Display your best projects in your **portfolio website**. Include those **client testimonials**. Make it easy for people to contact you.

Your website must also be easy to find on search engines like Google. Use basic **search engine optimization (SEO)**. Choose good keywords related to your services and niche. Make sure your site loads fast and works well on phones. A good website attracts potential clients.

### C. Use Social Media

Be active where potential clients might be. LinkedIn is good for professional connections. Instagram and Dribbble are great for showing visual work. Choose platforms that fit your **niche market** and style.

Do not just post pictures of your work. Share useful information. Write short tips about web design. Talk about common problems businesses face online. This helps you look like an expert. This is a form of **social media marketing** and **content marketing**. It helps build trust.

IV. Finding Clients for Your Business
-------------------------------------

### A. Meet People and Connect

Do not just wait for clients to find you. Go out and meet people. Attend local business events or online web design conferences. Join online groups or forums where designers and potential clients talk.

Build relationships with other professionals. Connect with marketing agencies, graphic designers, or copywriters. They might need a web designer for their projects, or they might send clients your way. You can also send clients to them. These partnerships help everyone. This is important for **client acquisition**.

### B. Use Digital Marketing

Help clients find you online. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** is key. Work on your website's SEO continuously. Write blog posts using keywords your ideal clients search for. *Data suggests SEO provides a high return on investment for service businesses because it attracts clients actively looking for help*.

Consider using paid ads (PPC - Pay-Per-Click). Google Ads can put your website in front of people searching for web designers. Social media ads on platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn can target specific industries or job titles. Start with a small budget and see what works.

**Content marketing** is also powerful. Create blog posts, guides, or even videos that answer questions your **target audience** has about websites. Share this content on your website and social media. It draws people in and shows your knowledge.

### C. Use Email Marketing

When people visit your website, offer them something valuable (like a checklist or guide) in exchange for their email address. This builds an email list. Send regular emails (maybe once or twice a month) to this list. Share useful tips, news about your services, or special offers. Email helps you stay in touch with potential clients and turn leads into paying customers.

V. Setting Prices and Working With Clients
------------------------------------------

### A. Clear Prices

Decide on your **pricing models**. Charging by the project gives clients a fixed price. This is often preferred. Charging by the hour can be better for projects where the work amount is unclear. Think about the pros and cons for you and the client.

Consider offering packages. Maybe a basic website package, a business package, and an e-commerce package. Each package includes different things and has a set price. This makes it easy for clients to understand what they get for their money. Be clear about what is included and what costs extra.

### B. Starting with New Clients

When you get a new client, start well. Use a clear **contract**. This document should explain exactly what work you will do (scope of work). It must state the payment amount and schedule. It should include timelines for finishing the work.

Talk clearly with the client from the start. Understand what they expect. Explain your process. Set up regular ways to communicate (like email or scheduled calls). Good communication avoids problems later. This is crucial for effective **project management**.

### C. Good Customer Service

Keeping clients happy is very important. Respond quickly when they contact you. Listen to their feedback and concerns. Be professional and polite always. Good **customer relationship management (CRM)** builds trust.

Try to do more than expected. Deliver great work on time. Offer helpful suggestions. Happy clients may hire you again. They might also tell others about your **web design agency**. Word-of-mouth referrals are very valuable for a **small business owner**.

Conclusion
----------

Starting a **web design business** takes effort. It does not happen overnight. You need to check your skills and maybe learn more. Finding a **niche market** helps you stand out. A solid business plan, especially the financial part, is needed. You must build a portfolio, even with sample projects at first. Marketing yourself online and offline is how you get clients. Clear pricing and good client communication are essential.

The demand for good websites keeps growing. This means there is real opportunity for **entrepreneurship** in this field. If you follow these steps, plan carefully, and work hard, you can build a successful business. Remember, the web world always changes. Keep learning new **web development skills**. Adapt to new trends. This continuous learning will help your business grow for a long time. Now is the time to take the first step.

""Lonely Boy Grows Up""


Upper East Siders,

You thought you knew everything about Lonely Boy.
But here’s a secret even I didn’t see coming:
The boy who spent his youth hiding behind a blog didn’t just disappear.
He evolved.

After penning his great novel (Inside, remember?), after confessing to being yours truly (Gossip Girl herself), Dan Humphrey finally got what he always wanted: recognition, power, acceptance.

Or so he thought.

Manhattan applauded. Serena kissed him. Blair forgave him.
Everyone moved on.
Except Dan.

Because Dan realized something chilling:
It was never enough.

No matter how many stories he told,
no matter how many people he exposed,
no matter how high he climbed into their golden circle —
he was still outside, watching through the glass.

And so he did what any self-made myth does:
He left the stage.


In the whispers of Brooklyn coffee shops, they say a man who fits his description —
messy brown hair, intense stare, always carrying old books —
appeared under a new name:
Joe.

Not a writer anymore — at least, not in the way you think.
No, now he crafts his stories out of real lives,
not words.
Not observation.
Action.

Love, loyalty, protection — at any cost.
Even if that cost was... bodies.

Because once you realize that you can rewrite people’s stories —
really rewrite them —
with a slip of poison, a well-placed lie, a missing person report...
why would you ever go back to mere blog posts?


They say Joe falls in love the way Dan once fell for Serena:
hopelessly, violently, with a story already written in his mind before the first ""Hello.""

But if you disappoint him?
If you don't fit the perfect ending he imagines?
Well, the final chapter won't be yours to write.

It’ll be his.


You know you love me.
XOXO,
Gossip Girl
(Or maybe not anymore...)


--


Dan became addicted to controlling stories.

When words stopped working, Joe was born.

The pen was mightier than the sword... until the sword was needed.

1k9ejxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TherapeuticKetamine/comments/1k9ejxo/alternatives_to_ketamine_that_are_worth/,Alternatives to ketamine that are worth investigating (OTC),"I thought it would be a good idea to compile a list of substances that share similar key anti-depressant properties with ketamine. They are legal, inexpensive and widely available. They can be used daily with minimal disruption to your daily routine. **They are non-hallucinogenic.**

- agmatine
- creatine
- uridine monophosphate
- Polygala tenuiflora (a botanical)
- sarcosine

Before trying any of these substances please research it properly and start with low doses to acclimatise yourself. There are many research papers which describe the ketamine-like qualities of these substances and dozens of reddit posts about people's experiences. Polygala tenuiflora has a long history of use in traditional medicine.

Agmatine has an interesting synergistic effect whereby it will amplify/enhance the effects of other substances, especially ones with similar pharmacological properties. This means it can be combined with a smaller-than-usual dose of ketamine and still provide beneficial therapeutic effects. *(A potential money-saving tactic)*

One reason why ketamine is so beneficial is because it counteracts the effects caused by excessive stress hormone levels (cortisol & adrenaline).
A highly complementary approach would be to lower stress levels **directly** by reducing the bodies stress response.

One easy way is maintaining stable blood sugar levels throughout the day (and night) since low blood sugar triggers a stress response. Eating or drinking something sweet like orange juice, honey or ripe fruit works for this purpose (eg in-between meals, before or after physical exercise, before ketamine sessions). To those of you who want to investigate this further (why the body triggers an excessive stress response), you can look into [metabolic health / the role of mitochondria](https://www.functionalps.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Picture-22.png)

There are also supplements with useful anti-stress effects:

- theanine
- inosine
- Magnolia officinalis extract
- Albizia julibrissin extract
- Valerian extract

These have calming and relaxing effects.
For coffee drinkers, theanine pairs particularly well with caffeine as it prevents the caffeine stress response and gives a smoother experience *(caffeine stress response = anxiety, shakiness, sweating, feeling wired, inability to focus, and sometimes cold extremities).*",0,1745788092.0,TherapeuticKetamine,1,0.5,False
1k9ej66,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k9ej66/does_the_café_brew_collection_percolator_deliver/,Does the Café Brew Collection Percolator Deliver Bold Flavor? Detailed Review Inside!,"Using the Café Brew Collection PK008 Stovetop Percolator has become a daily ritual in my kitchen. As someone always chasing the perfect cup of coffee, I couldn’t resist testing this sleek and functional percolator for myself. Right out of the box, it stood out with its minimalistic design and high-quality borosilicate glass, sourced from Schott DURAN in Germany, radiating a level of craftsmanship that immediately caught my attention. Brewing coffee with this percolator has been both satisfying and easily integrated into my hectic mornings.

**DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY**  
The first thing that struck me was its transparency. Watching the coffee bubble and brew inside the glass body felt oddly satisfying, offering a bit of entertainment while waiting for the magic to happen. The borosilicate glass construction screamed durability, and it feels robust yet lightweight in hand. The BPA-free construction and dishwasher-safe features add a reassuring nod to safety and functionality. I also appreciated the stainless steel basket and heat diffuser, which work seamlessly with the percolator—truly a thoughtful design. However, the phenolic handle, while heat-resistant, can get a tad warm during extended use on gas stoves, requiring a little caution.

**PERFORMANCE AND VERSATILITY**  
Over the weeks, I’ve tested this percolator on different stovetops, including gas, ceramic, and electric ranges. It adapts remarkably well to all, maintaining even heat distribution thanks to the included metal heat diffuser. The eight-cup capacity is perfect for a family breakfast or when hosting friends. That said, if you need just a single cup, portioning can be tricky since it’s designed for the full pot experience. While brewing, the aroma of fresh coffee fills the kitchen, and each batch tastes richer than the last—thanks to its effective brewing method extracting maximum flavor.

**POSITIVES**  
Out of all the features, here’s what I enjoyed the most:  
- The clear glass design lets you monitor the brewing process.  
- Dishwasher-safe and BPA-free construction makes clean-up simple and safe.  
- Compatible with various stovetop types, offering high versatility.  
- Borosilicate glass ensures durability and heat resistance.  
- The included heat diffuser optimizes the brewing process for a balanced flavor profile.

**USER SATISFACTION**  
Having friends and family try coffee brewed with this percolator has been enlightening. Everyone loved the coffee's depth in flavor, though a couple of them mentioned preferring electric models for the convenience of automation. My coworker, a percolator enthusiast, praised its simplicity. It’s worth mentioning that because this is a manual coffee maker, it’s not the fastest option, so if you’re in a rush, this may require a bit of patience.

**AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**  
No product is perfect, and this percolator is no exception. While there’s a lot to love, here’s where it falls short:  
- The phenolic handle can retain heat after prolonged use on gas stoves.  
- Portioning smaller batches of coffee can be challenging.  
- Glass construction, though durable, requires careful handling to prevent chips or cracks.  
- It lacks a precise temperature control mechanism, leaving all heat regulation up to the user.

**PRODUCT RIVALS**  
Looking at the landscape of stovetop percolators, alternatives like the Farberware Classic Stainless Steel or the Presto 12-Cup Coffee Maker offer some interesting options. For instance, the Farberware model boasts stainless steel construction, which many may prefer for added sturdiness, though it’s not as visually appealing as the Café Brew’s glass design. Meanwhile, the Presto Coffee Maker offers greater capacity and automated brewing but sacrifices the simplicity and control this manual percolator provides. Where this glass percolator shines is in its visual aesthetic and eco-friendly materials, which neither rival matches.

**QUALITY FOR PRICE**  
Considering its blend of aesthetics, performance, and build quality, this glass coffee percolator sits at an attractive price point. While some might argue for upgrades in materials (like an improved handle), I genuinely feel it offers excellent value. You’re paying for craftsmanship and the joy of brewing coffee the old-school way. For anyone who views coffee as more than just a caffeine boost, this percolator transforms a mundane task into a delightful ritual.

1k9eh5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/comments/1k9eh5t/how_nofap_and_semen_retention_helped_me_lose_my/,How NoFap and Semen Retention helped me lose my virginity at 19 (currently writing this at day 30),"Hey everyone,

I noticed that topics like r/NoFap and r/Semenretention barely get mentioned here, even though they had a massive impact on my life. That’s why I want to share my story — not to brag, but maybe to give hope to someone who's still struggling.

Thanks to these habits, I built the kind of quiet, natural confidence that helped me lose my virginity at 19.
If you're curious how it all happened, from the first unexpected moment to the full experience, I’ll tell you everything below.

NoFap and Semen Retention sound simple: no masturbation, no adult content, for a set period of time. But what they built inside me went far beyond self-control. After just a week, I felt different, more grounded, more alive. I stopped feeling so fragile around people. After a few 30-day streaks, it wasn’t just inside my head anymore: people reacted differently to me. I felt stronger, more comfortable in my own skin. I didn’t need to pretend or impress anyone. For the first time, just being myself felt enough.

And then it happened.

I met her during a random board game night with some friends. Nothing serious, just pizza, bad jokes, and nerdy games. She wasn’t the type I always thought I was looking for. She was shorter, a little messy, glasses slightly crooked, laughing way too hard at stupid jokes. But something about her energy pulled me in like gravity.

We teased each other about the rules of some dumb card game. She'd nudge my arm when I was ""cheating,"" and I found myself smiling without thinking about it. I didn’t analyze every word. I didn’t second-guess every move. I just let myself be there, with her.

When the night ended, and she hugged me goodbye, she pressed a little closer, her hands lingering. For a moment, I felt my old panic wanting to come up, What does this mean? Am I reading it wrong? but then another part of me, stronger, simply whispered: It’s okay. You’re enough.

A few days later, we met for coffee. What was supposed to be an hour turned into four, until they literally had to kick us out at closing time. On the way home, she randomly challenged me to a race to a park bench. We ran like kids, laughing, nearly tripping over ourselves.

When we collapsed, gasping for air, I looked at her,  flushed cheeks, messy hair, eyes sparkling, and without thinking, I leaned in.
I missed slightly. Our noses bumped awkwardly.
We both laughed and then she grabbed my shirt and pulled me into a real kiss. Deep, hungry, undeniable.

Back at her place, it felt like a dream I didn’t want to wake up from.
We kissed heavily on her couch, her hands exploring my body like she already knew what she wanted. When she whispered, half-laughing, half-breathless, that she had been thinking about me nonstop since game night, my heart nearly exploded.
When she dropped to her knees in front of me, looking up with that mischievous smile, I almost couldn’t believe it was real.
The first blowjob of my life was messy, overwhelming, and so intense I barely held it together.
After that, we stumbled into her bedroom, undressing between kisses and clumsy laughter.
The sex wasn’t perfect, we fumbled, repositioned, laughed at ourselves, but it was real. It was raw. It was two imperfect people, wanting each other, no masks, no pretending.

Lying next to her afterward, her head resting on my chest, I realized something deeper than any orgasm could give me:
I didn’t win because I became someone else. I didn’t trick or fake my way here.
I had simply grown into someone who could connect, because I had finally learned to accept myself.

If you’re feeling stuck right now, lost, like nothing will ever change, I just want you to know: it can. Maybe not overnight. Maybe not the way you expect. But it can. Work on yourself from the inside. Be patient.
One day, when you least expect it, it might all click.

Would love to hear if anyone else had similar moments. Stay strong, brothers.",0,1745787895.0,virgin,11,0.22,False

This situation has made me realize that although I can sometimes “read between the lines,” I’m also still somewhat naive (I just don’t always see red flags up front…but usually I reflect on questionable interactions, and eventually it’s clear that something is very wrong. I suspect I’m in this process of reflection of a red flag (or maybe I’m too judgemental).

The situation: one of my co-workers, will call him Acey, is a friend from work. Acey and this other co-worker friend, Bob, and I chat on the bus to and from work, and occasionally the three of us grab a bite, nothing wild. Acey has ADHD and the other co-worker friend is on the spectrum, so it’s really great chilling with them. Low pressure.

I started to notice that whenever the three of us go out Acey is REALLY concerned about proximity of restaurants from his apartment ….like I’ve suggested we try out all these interesting neighborhoods in the city, and he always wants to stay within like a four block radius and eat fast food joints or taquerias. Basically I like hanging out with Bob because not only is he hilarious but he’s a city person like myself…and we like to try different venues. I’ve noticed Acey complains a lot about this city, and I got the impression he voluntarily moved here, so I never quite understood his mentality. He is a good friend at work, but I just had this off feeing about him the more we hung out.

Anyhow, Acey asks for my number one day, and viewing him as a friend, I gave him my number. Since then, he’s texted, and I always respond with light hearted texts. Then yesterday, the two of us are riding the bus, and he asks me what I’m doing after I get off…told him I was heading out to Haigh Street (we live in the Bay Area). He said that’s too far, that we should eat nearby. I liked the idea of catching up, but it was the first time where I was really annoyed with him…haha, I had my sights set on Haight Street, and he just dismissed it because he wants to stay in his radius. So we end up going to a restaurant within his half-mile (bullshit) radius where he’s comfortable.

We have a good time and chat it up. We split a margarita, then snuck booze into a movie theatre and chatted more. We walk back toward are dwellings. We stop at a street corner and just chat. He says he wants to talk more (honestly I was pretty tired at this point), but I’m like (I have few friends, and he’s entertaining), so I suggest, …let’s just split an uber and go to a 24 hour diner or late night coffee joint in North Beach (less than two miles away). And he’s like “is there anything closer?”At this point, I was getting frustrated…the immediate neighborhood’s venues are all closed….he wants to hang out, yet every suggestion I give he shoots down. So I finally say (assuming, he just doesn’t want to walk), “I’ll pay for a 5 minute Uber!”

He finally says something like “I’m not allowed to”…and I laugh, saying “who is not allowing you to walk around the city”.

….then he tells me he has ankle monitor. I thought he was kidding …nope. He has a large device cuffed under his pants. I ask why. He says he doesn’t want to talk about it. He tells me a bit about his parole officer. Honestly, at this point, I’m wondering who is this dude. He seems down to earth and friendly at work. My first thought was, I don’t want to spend time with Acey anymore. 

Then last night, after I say goodbye, he sends a text, basically asking if I’m interested in a relationship. Lol. I told him I’m interested in him as a friend (….and actually I’m kind of thinking I don’t want to buddy-buddy anymore).

Thoughts?

Also, does anyone have experience with these ankle monitors…I’d like to know what exactly this dude did to get this special bracelet.

I’m debating if I should be understanding, or just call it quits with friendship.

So between 3 and 4 weeks ago I started my first compost as I've recently moved out and have the space to do so now. I figured ""if I get it started I'll have to keep tending to it"" so I just started throwing coffee grounds and filters, hay, cardboard, paper towels, and kitchen scraps (family of 4 and we produce a decent bit). Just started layering in a milk crate until it was filled up and switched it to a tote that I had outside. I drilled holes on the bottom and sides (top had them already from being used as a temporary chicken transport in the past) and have turned it about once a week. Yesterday there was steam and heat coming out when I turned it!!!! Genuinely so excited, I didn't know it would start so quick, I know ""it'll happen anyway just throw it in"" but seeing it in action? Sick. So I know not to store it near the house or existing structure, keep it moist ( I have not watered but the coffee grounds and food waste I've been putting in it along with the holes on top when it rains have it plenty moist but not soaked). What I'm looking for advice for is what can I do to not mess it up lol? Like I see a lot about how turning frequently will break it down faster, but is there a such thing as turning too much? Or can I turn as frequently as desired? Is there anything I absolutely cannot put in food waste wise? I've only added fruit and veggie scraps in fear of screwing something up. I've seen to avoid grease altogether because it'll make it go rancid/take forever to break down but what about meat scraps? Cooked bones? Dairy? Leftover casserole? I have some ants in the tote but I figure that's normal (I put a rotten cantaloupe so I'm sure the sugar drew them in), but I'm not worried about insects or wildlife getting into it, I live in a rural area. Once the tote is full (it's close now) I plan on just doing it pile style and keeping it raked up in a somewhat condensed pile. Thanks for any advice! ",0,1745787376.0,composting,1,0.5,False

Days 1 and 2. Flew from London to DFW. v jetlagged but managed to go for some great food at the Michelin star panther city bbq and hit a few bars- nickel City was our favourite, with delish frozen Irish coffees!
The next day we got up early to eat at goldees - the no 1 bbq in texas according to texas monthly. Queued for around 2 hrs on a v cold morning. Totally worth it. Then we went to the stockyards. Was cool, but the massive honky tonk, Billy bobs was closed for a private event. Bit of pinball at a nearby arcade and then bed.

Days 3, 4 and 5. A longish drive to Austin and 3 amazing days. We ate more incredible bbq (interstellar) and tacos. Terry blacks was a bit dry tho. Saw st vincent one night and aziz ansari perform another. Went down south congress. Rented a boat on the lake. Swam in Barton springs. Stayed at the driskill, which was a lovely hotel.

Day 6. Drove to fredericksburg via Hamilton pool preserve and blanco for some lunch. Hiked up enchanted rock at sunset. Stunning.

Day 7 and 8. Drove to Mayan dude ranch in bandera through the hill country and stayed for 2 nights. Met some great people and Had a nice visit to bandera Town. Loved arkey blues bar.

Day 9. Drove to San antonio. Visited the alamo, pearl district and a boat on the riverwalk. Stayed at the menger, which was nice.

Day 10, 11 and 12. Epic drive to big bend along 90. Took about 7 hrs. Stayed at chisos mountain Lodge and managed to see sunset at the window view. We did the epic South rim trail the next day and then went to terlingua in the evening. Next day was an early start with lost mine trail, followed by hot springs, some rest and then the Ross maxwell scenic drive. We were tired!

Day 13. Drove to marfa. Saw the praha store, giant mural, hotel paisano and ate some delish Italian sandwiches at bordo and a great steak at margarets. Stayed in a teepee at el cosmico, which was cool, but wish we'd stayed at hotel paisano.

Day 14. Long and dull drive to carlsbad. Stopped at Balmorhea pool on way, but it was too cold to swim. Had planned to see bats leave carlsbad cave at sunset, but a dust storm put a stop to that. So just chilled at the hotel. Tbh we needed the rest.

Day 15. Went to carlsbad caverns for self guided tour. It was incredible.  Then a long and dull drive to blue swallow motel at tucumcari. It was a great motel, but not worth a 4hr drive.

Day 16. Tried to drive rt 66 but satnav kept putting us on interstate. We saw Russell travel center and midpoint cafe, but it was closed, cadillac ranch and then a lunch at big texan steak house before flying home.

Here are some of my thoughts and what’s been on my mind, what I’m still figuring out and how to explore this stuff more to discover who I am. 

Sundays- I think Sundays can be enjoyed differently and not just be a wait til the family get home from church and lounge around. I don’t know how to do that yet. 

WOW-coffee/tea-yum! Alcohol-my younger less obedient self enjoyed an occasional drink & enjoyed being more uninhibited. I haven’t drank since leaving. Not because I don’t want to but because I don’t have anyone to safely drink with & I’m quite a bit older and I’ve heard alcohol hits different. I was a fun tipsy person, i was spontaneous and less in my head 

Sex/body image-I want to try to be more body positive, dress for me and less for my underwear. I want to feel that sex is a mutually enjoyed activity with no shame, that I’m allowed to want/enjoy things. 

Parenting-mixed faith parenting sucks sometimes. 

Faith/Church- I’m still a believer in Christ, I just done know if/when I’ll be ready to attend another one. How does my new belief system mix with being in a mixed faith marriage

Source: [https://www.law.umaryland.edu/student-life/life-in-baltimore/](https://www.law.umaryland.edu/student-life/life-in-baltimore/)

[**Fells Point**](https://livebaltimore.com/neighborhoods/fells-point/)

Fells Point is one of the most charming areas in Baltimore. Its waterfront location and cobblestone lined streets make it a very appealing location to live, dine, and shop. Fells Point is accessible from other areas of the city by Water Taxi. It is a popular location for lots of bars, some great restaurants, boutique shopping, live music, and the historic Frederick Douglass-Isaac Myers Maritime Park.

[**Mount Vernon**](https://livebaltimore.com/neighborhoods/mount-vernon/)

Mount Vernon is just north of the law school, still within walking distance, with more of a downtown feel. It is home to the Washington Monument, Walters Art Museum, and Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. This area is known for its culture and charm. Additionally, this neighborhood is home to some of Baltimore's best LGBTQ+ nightlife. You will find plenty of individual coffee shops and historic landmarks. You can also find Penn Station here, where you can hop on an Amtrak to New York or Philadelphia, or take the Marc Train to DC.

[**Federal Hill**](https://livebaltimore.com/neighborhoods/federal-hill/)

Many of our students live in the Federal Hill area. Federal Hill is within walking distance to the law school. It is also near the Ravens stadium. Many young professionals live here and it is a lively community with a big tailgating and bar scene, many restaurants, and home to Federal Hill Park, which overlooks the Inner Harbor. It is full of historic rowhouses and charming streets.

**Locust Point**

This neighborhood is at the southern end of the Federal Hill peninsula and has a similar look and feel to Federal Hill, but is a bit quieter. Here you can find Fort McHenry where the national anthem was penned and the Under Armour Global Headquarters. Many students live in Locust Point.

**Harbor East/Little Italy**

Harbor East is on the east side of the Inner Harbor, between Downtown and Fells Point. It is full of high-rise apartments, gyms, shopping, waterfront dining, and a Whole Foods. This is also where the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School is located, should you pursue a JD/MBA. Little Italy, just to the north, is a charming area full of Italian restaurants. 

**Canton**

Canton is just east of Fells Point and is situated between the waterfront and Patterson Park, which is home to walking trails, sports fields, a pool, and tennis courts. Canton Square is a fun area with a park surrounded by bars and restaurants. Canton, like Federal Hill, is a mix of historic rowhouses and restaurants and bars. Canton is also is on the water and has Canton Waterfront Park, which offers eight acres of harbor views and is one end of the 4.4 mile Baltimore Waterfront Promenade trail that goes from Canton through Fells Point to the Inner Harbor and Federal Hill.

**Hampden**

Hampden is a bit north of Baltimore city and you will certainly need a car should you visit there. Known for its fantastic food scene and arts community, each year Miracle of Lights on 34th Street draws many visitors around the holidays to view the lights. 

**Downtown**

Downtown is where the law school is located, along with the Inner Harbor, National Aquarium, the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, and other tourist landmarks. Edgar Allan Poe's Grave is actually right next to the law school courtyard, downtown. Being on the harbor provides many benefits, as well. Baltimore Beach Volleyball is a popular daytime activity. The Orioles stadium is also located downtown, next to Camden Station, where you can take the MARC train to DC for an externship. Many students also choose to live in the high rises in the downtown area, including Redwood, Camden Court, The Zenith, and The Atrium. ",1,1745787107.0,UMBaltimore,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

Kami yung couple na laging may story every day kase gusto namin mag-coffee at kumain sa labas. I am earning big enough po to spoil my ex, like literally kahit sa food, mga luho niya, at pangangailangan niya. Siya yung kasama ko nung walang-wala pa ako up until nung nakabili ako ng unang bahay, kotse, at sahod na gusto ko. I was there as well noong student pa lang siya at naging nurse sa isang province, minimum wage sa province kaya hirap, kaya mostly ako talaga ang provider. We were so happy before I caught her cheating and meeting another man (better sa looks sa akin but no work and nagchochongke pa... yep, I stalked the guy too much nung nalaman ko kung sino). I immediately ended our relationship nung nalaman ko, but she kept begging that time na hindi niya sadya and she felt na hindi niya masabi sakin yung problema kaya sa iba niya na-feel gusto sabihin. But ayon, naging firm ako sa decision ko that time to end our relationship, kahit grabe yung pagbe-beg niya para mag-stay ako. She promised na hindi siya magmo-move on, she promised na hihintayin niya ako, she also said na hindi niya hahayaan mapunta ako sa iba and sisirain niya next relationship namin, hindi siya magre-relationship ulit kung hindi ako, she said everything to make me believe na she loved me so much. I blocked her sa lahat ng social media that time para makapag-move on ako ng mabilis and nagfocus ako sa career ko.

Now, what is happening is my ex still messages me on my number (can't change my number lol because of accounts and bank-related stuff). Never siya nag-fail mag-message or mag-missed call every month sakin gamit iba't ibang number kase binablock ko. Noong nakaraang araw, in-unblock ko na siya sa social media, then out of curiosity I checked her accounts. Andon pa rin lahat ng pics namin, pati sa IG and FB. She loved posting our pics that time kase hilig namin lumabas at mag-travel (syempre sagot ko hahaha). I don't know what to feel, okay na ako, pero biglang nakaramdam ako ng awa. Like noong nag-birthday ako, nabasa ko yung birthday greeting niya sakin and she still calls me kung ano tawagan namin and telling me kung gaano niya ako kamahal. Nakaramdam ako ng awa pero ayaw na ayaw ko ng bumalik dahil sa trauma na ginawa niya, kaya I don't know kung ano tong nararamdaman ko.",1,1745786951.0,OffMyChestPH,3,0.67,False

I developed eczema later in life, and I think it all started when I dove into an intense graduate program and started drinking coffee. Before I knew it, I had these red rashes popping up on my shoulder blades, which eventually spread to my back. I had three huge eczema patches on each shoulder and a large one on the middle of my back. My self esteem took a huge hit. I couldn't look at myself in the mirror. 

I went to a dermatologist who just prescribed medication, but it didn’t really help me. One time, I took a steroid for another skin issue, and it caused my hair to fall out! It felt like I had no luck with dermatologists.

I started using dead sea salt in my baths and showers, which provided some relief but was a bit stingy.

I also realized that coffee was making me really nauseous, no matter how I had it—milk, no milk, no sugar. I felt so dependent on it to kickstart my mornings! But the more I drank, the itchier and more irritated my skin became. My skin was always itchy and uncomfortable. I was starting to go crazy. I 

So, I decided to take a week off from coffee. Now that the week is up, I’m thrilled to say my eczema is almost completely gone! My back looks clear just in time for summer!

I’m looking for some low-calorie, alcohol-free ways to add flavor to my drinks — mainly coffee, smoothies, and protein shakes.
Would love to hear your ideas!

Right now for my big iced latte (unsweetened almond milk + espresso + ice), I add 6–10 drops of pure monk fruit extract (no erythritol, stevia, or sucrose — just monk fruit) and about 1/2 tsp of Simply Organic Madagascar Vanilla Extract.
It’s soooo good — just a little sweet, nice vanilla flavor, and the coffee taste still shines through!

The thing is, I love the vanilla flavor so much that I end up adding it to everything — lattes, smoothies, protein shakes, overnight oats, desserts… it’s a whole vibe 😋 
But since vanilla extract usually has alcohol, I’m looking for a way to switch it up without losing that delicious flavor!

I’ve tried looking at sugar-free syrups too, but most of them are made with erythritol or other sweeteners I’m not a big fan of.

I’m happy with using monk fruit drops for sweetness — just struggling to find good alcohol-free vanilla or other flavor options (like hazelnut or almond would be awesome too).

Any recommendations for clean, low-calorie flavorings you love?

Also, do you handle flavoring coffee and smoothies differently? Like one type of syrup for lattes and another kind for smoothies?

TL:DR at the bottom - if you do read everything though, I apologise it's long.

**Backstory.**

I have worked in my current company for many years straight out of college, (including three promotions and a department change due to a new role in company). 8 years ago I started in this new role within the company. This started well but I was never quite comfortable. There was an individual working here I'll call Jones. Jones was a 'jack-the-lad' type, however his behaviour revolved around drugs and basically having no respect for women, other than to their face, and a weird obsession with me, always relating me to be this fantasy bloke hitting on all the women I never did never who I was. But I would often here about what he would do if he was my age, how I am a disappointment etc... I always kept my distance from him. Some days we'd turn up to work and he would be as high as a kite just giggling to himself.

However, he had a personality that people enjoyed, any reports to him often were followed up with 'you know how he is', 'he doesn't mean it', etc... etc... his behaviour was allowed. However I wasn't the only one - I later found out - who was intimidated by his behaviour erratic behaviour swings. He was unpredictable, one moment nice, the next swearing at you whilst towering over you with a finger pointed at you. This, although I hated, I could deal with. I often turned my back on him, left him, and didn't have a problem reporting it, but was always met with headshakes and told 'that's just how he is'. For four years I had set-up in my own office out the way of everyone reporting wasn't working and everyone seemed to allow his behaviour. Strangely though, within those four years, he improved, he cleaned himself of drugs (although I never truly believed it, I believe it was just reduced use). He got into a relationship, which is what I think changed, he spoke about it often.

Anyway, he improved and soon enough became pleasant to work with. But one thing stayed. He had this fantasy of who I was. Any and every women I ever spoke to he'd come up with elaborate events of what I should say, what I should do, or what had or hadn't occurred. Always sexually suggestive and graphic. Everyone would laugh and I'd push back, but that led to more laughs and just kept things going. Jones had a friend, Malcolm, and the two of them fed off one another, encouraged each other and developed a close friendship. It was like this four a few years.

I've always kept my work life and personal life separate. In all my years working I never entertained colleagues outside of work. No real reason why, just was always nice to keep it separate. I was never informal with any of them. Then two years ago I met two people, Leah and Rose. Leah and Rose worked in a different department but we shared the same office, their group were social, happy, chatty. Importantly, my age, my interests and the rest. They worked close with my group so I had originally only a working relationship, but it became a true friendship, one I can't pinpoint when it started. Before long, I have been out drinking with them, been round, vice versa, met their partners, mine. Open invitations all round. At work, we worked as required, but now again we'll stop and chat. We were on social media together and spoke often on there.

But Jones and Malcolm. Despised this friendship. Id never talk about them to Jones and Malcolm I knew what they'd say and what they would insinuate. But they done it anyway. Soon I was being told how I was pathetic, I brought nothing to this friendship, they wouldn't 'allow' their partners to be friends with a bloke. I needed to accept that at my age we lose friends now, go to work, go home repeat. Or, they'd go the opposite way, telling me how I ought to be hitting on them, that they're only friends with me because that's what they want etc... etc... some of these insinuations got... graphic and led to arguments and disagreements. but importantly, Jones had also recently been left by his partner as I was meeting Leah and Rose. He came into the office one time moaning trying to understand what 'gaslighting' meant. His partner had left him claiming him to be a liar, manipulator and a gas lighter - all true now I look back.

Eventually though an obsession occurred. In the December Jones turned to me and said he felt he'd like to r\*pe Rose. Disgusting, it led to a big argument about how such a comment was not appropriate, he just laughs and say's he was winding me up, that I must be trying to hit on her as I was getting 'defensive'. The r\*pe comments continued though around what she was wearing, and always followed with laughter and like it's a joke. Or they'll exhale deeply and shake their head saying ""that's dangerous to wear that"".

Comments from here on out got worse, but always relating myself and Rose together in quite graphic descriptions. I wanted to report this. Why didn't I. I was scared. It sounds awful yeah. But within all this I have been threatened and I have been told ""I'm clearly inept to make moves, so I need encouragement"" which led to threats of drugging me to force me to make moves. Twice I found drugs in my sandwiches, which he put there laughing at me when he showed me, I stopped eating as I couldn't trust what I was eating. And he started making comments, that if I didn't make moves, he would, that me getting defensive was encouraging him to, take it further. Those comments, the r\*pe comment, the fact he wasn't afraid to threaten me, drug me as a joke. I didn't want that to occur to her and it terrified me. And I didn't want anything more to happen to myself. One time I did want to make her aware, but as we went on a walk Malcolm took a photo of the two of us with ""Snitches get Stiches"" and sent it to me. So I kept it to myself. I regret it massively. All I want is for Leah and Rose to be safe.

By February it got too much though. I was getting a comment every single day. Threats. and he had now started interacting with her at work. 'drive-bys' he called it. And if it wasn't that he'd leave things by her desk or area as an excuse to go over and chat to her again. He was two faced, act nice to her, then come to me telling me how I was a 'lad' and should be hitting on her and stealing her away from her partner. It was disgusting, not me and it was a constant harassment of how i should be with her. and if it wasn't it was that I shouldn't have friends we don't have friends now at our age. (I am 26. He is 38. Leah and Rose, 26. Malcolm, 45.)

In February though I needed to report it. It'd got too much. But I lied to Rose. As part of the reporting I had to make Leah and Rose aware at the same time as HR, that way they could support them and Jones and Malcolm could be removed from site simultaneously. But I was fearful of what Jones would do if he picked up a hint that Rose knew what was going on so I didn't tell Rose how much she was involved. HR had to later tell her. I learnt she was... upset, obviously, but largely betrayed. Disappointed in me that I hadn't told her. I just wanted her to be safe and I also had no idea how to face her and tell her about the way we have been imagined with one another. I hate people discussing myself, I don't like talking about myself, let alone someone graphically describing my body and then associating it with people I care about and describing there body as well.

Anyway that's most the backstory. There's a lot more involved but I don't want to make this too long.

**What then happened**

The investigation began. The two of them were removed from site, Leah and Rose continued working. Myself... I broke down. After reporting I was initially guilty and so concerned for Leah and Rose and then I saw so much of what Jones and Malcolm had done to me over the years, the manipulations, lies, belittling - they'd made me lose a lot over the years without my realising and how much I had been worried them - I submitted a 60 page document to HR in my first meeting as to what had occurred to me, so I haven't put it all in this submission. I broke down completely, I'm in therapy now and on some decent tablets to help me sleep and to stop my panic attacks and constant crying. They've ruined me quite a lot. So I've been off work for three months now. This was a mistake though.

Everyone at work had obviously begun to question why the three of us were of. Myself, Jones, and Malcolm. Work wouldn't say anything because of 'confidentiality' they wouldn't even say to people I was off ill, so the three of us were grouped together into the questions around why were we off.

At work we have 'support aids', they're individuals at work who volunteer to support people at work. You can go and talk to them confidentially and quietly and they'll listen and support you at work with any issues. Rose went to one of these support aids, as she should, for support. However, this support aid, didn't keep what she was told confidential. Everyone at works been asking why the three of us were off work and this person was able to answer with what she knew. And people trusted what they said, why shouldn't they, it's a privileged and respected role. People know they know things no one else does. What this person didn't know is why I was off. All they knew were off the disgusting things being spoken about relating to Rose. And they soon started answering peoples questions. Telling them what had been said, including their own feelings on it. But grouped me in with Jones and Malcolm.

Soon word spread and everyone's now talking about me being just as objectifying and misogynistic as Jones and Malcolm. No one is saying why I am off, no one will tell anyone I am off even just ill. And now this aid is telling people why we're off. It gets worse. Jones has a good relationship with someone called Jane. Jones for the past few months had been threatening me with one of his fantasies and telling me he was going to tell Jane this fantasy if I don't start making moves etc... turns out, he had told Jane this story about how I had a physical relationship with Rose.

He had wound me up about this fantasy in January, at the end of January it spun a whole story to me (after he had spent the previous night out drinking with Jane) about how Jane doesn't like me or Rose and she doesn't want to speak to us because she likes x and x liked rose and blah blah blah etc... etc... some real childish playground stuff so I didn't think anything of it. But it turned out (through the investigation they discovered) that night he had told Jane this rumour about Rose and I and he didn't want us to find out.

It was a false and not true rumour, but Jane is the resident gossip. She told everyone. About two weeks into the investigation, with everyone now believing me to be the same as Jones and Malcolm people had now started to accept that what Jane had told them was true. A support aid themselves had said I was this person, so it wouldn't be hard to believe I was lying myself and making up rumours. So two weeks in Rose was in the workplace and had now heard this rumour and believed it hard. I hated how betrayed she felt.

Work has sworn us to secrecy they haven't even told them why I was off work and told them not to reach out to me etc... so after two weeks with me being off work the same amount of time as Jones and Malcolm, wondering why I was off, everyone had no choice but to believe what the work representative has learnt from their confidential meeting and now the rumour - that's why I must've been off Rose believed.

Believing I was of work for the same type of conversation Jones and Malcolm entertain and that I had this rumour made up. She was distraught. betrayed. I became aware of Rose knowing this rumour when I received an anonymous message (which I believe came from Jones) "" :') You thought she was your friend, but now she knows, she'll know you no more"". and a link to Roses TikTok.

When all this started Rose removed me from everything, understandable. However her account is public their were four posts... they... they were strong. and hurt a lot. she had believed the rumours and this person I was and she was now hurting.

I reported it to HR and asked for them to support Rose and reassure her. HR ran a quick investigation and it's confirmed Jones made it up, told Jane and passed it on into the workplace and learnt that this support aid had been telling people in answer to questions about why the three of us were of. But would they reassure and tell Rose. No. Why. Confidentiality; Rose doesn't need to know. She's entitled to her opinion, it's unfortunate she thinks of me the way she does now, but I need to accept it.

It's not about changing her opinion I've been saying. This process was meant to keep us safe, supported and also keep things confidential but with that failing you've made her feel more uncomfortable, especially as I returned to work last week; and she won't even look at me, avoids me, won't even answer emails. The workplace is more uncomfortable for her now. not to mention how the entire team want's nothing to do with me (out of the entire department a team of about 30, only three people have entertained some sort of conversation with me) all of them thinking I'm this awful person. But every time I report I'm told. Nothing can be done. It's all confidential. It's unfortunate. I need to move on. I need to put my 'business head on'.

I've returned to work and I have stood in a lift and been called an 'incel'. I have had people not wanting to ask if I am okay, because they quote Roses TikTok that I am 'playing the victim'. No one wants to join me for lunch thinking I'll just make up a rumour about me sleeping with them, again quoting another of her videos that I made rumours about her. Any and all rumours have been confirmed as true after Rose made her posts. It compromised HR's investigation into the rumour as well as everyone was now adamant it was true as She has 'confirmed it'.

HR won't do anything about any of it. It's a nightmare. Everyone around me are talking and acting just like Jones and Malcolm have been to me now. due to, what feels, their failures. No one is allowed to discuss the investigation. No one is allowed to share details of what they know on their side. All they've discussed with Rose and Leah are the original complaints of sexual harassment, they won't tell them anything else. So I have to pay now for this rebranded reputation, whilst knowing I am walking around making Leah and Rose uncomfortable, as I know how they see me. I've asked them to at least tell Leah and Rose that I was off work for my own mental health by choice, I hadn't been removed from site. They won't do that. I've asked, as clearly I am uncomfortable at work can something be done. They wont as it risks revealing details of the investigation and confidentiality of the events.

What did HR want to do though? They brought to me a plan asking if I would support a recommendation that Rose is taken out and her position, changed to working elsewhere with another group on bullying grounds! I obviously didn't support that. One, she's built a great career currently and is in the process of potentially having a whole new role etc... made for her over some work she's been doing and the last thing I want is to have her as an instigator to wrong doing and how that would effect her. And being made out to be a bad guy is awful.

I'm stuck. Last Thursday I had enough though. I couldn't take it anymore. Everyone at work, no one is talking to me. no one want's anything to do with me. Even people in Leah and Roses immediate team are not answering my emails or acknowledging, no nods in passing, no greetings. Nothing either they've heard the same rumours and associations, or, as hard as it is to say, I know Rose. If I'm mud in her mind at the moment, she herself won't be saying anything nice about me. I was getting fed up with people using Roses own words to mock me and get at me. Last Thursday I decided I don't like social media anymore. I blocked whole swathes of people - including Rose. And uninstalled everything. Unfortunately this upset Rose - I've since learnt.

She obviously doesn't know why I included her, and if I'm honest, I put up with a lot in support of her and when it came to her holding onto my character she couldn't do it and publicly announced what she thought of me which has had a direct effect on how people are treating me and it's hurting. But she was upset, and she made two more TikTok posts about it. One made me feel bad, to me it clearly shows she doesn't understand she clearly doesn't see she's done anything wrong and I get that TikTok has always been her outlet. The second though, hurt me, it was quite toxic really. Saying how as a man I should be suffering in silence - I don't know how to take this.

When talking with HR, when Rose heard the rumour and conversation she hadn't reported it. I knew she knew as I saw the TikToks about myself and what people have said to me. I reported it, it's being kept as my confidential information and because she hadn't they wont go and tell her about it as it's confidential to me now. So they won't even reassure her even though I know, and can see she's uncomfortable, and I can't tell her because I'm under strict rules now as well not to talk about it.

They won't even tell her that the support aid she went to has leaked what was discussed. It kills me watching how she is at work around myself. She's self conscience, won't look at me in passing, plans to avoid crossing my path. One time the lift opened on a floor she was there, and instead she took the stairs. I don't want to be this person she's worried to be around, it's not a great place for her to be working in with this image of me. And if you read some of the stuff Jones and Malcolm used to say, you also wouldn't want to be in the same building as them, so having this association on me is difficult at work - people have even crossed the road when coming towards me and crossed back over after I've gone by, it's awful! but I'm being told it's just 'unfortunate' and I need to just concentrate on managing my work.

I know in my last catch up with HR the investigator told me how both Leah and Rose spoke highly of me and were happy with me in their initial meetings, it upset me. But Rose was very disappointed I didn't tell her she had comments about her. The investigator even told me they haven't been made aware of what's been happening on my end so understands Leah and Rose will not being able to learn why I felt I couldn't tell her, but I need to remember in the workplace, and even out the workplace, we cannot talk about this investigation at any point and tell her. So she'll always view me like this now, and she'll always be uncomfortable.

I'm in the process now of looking for a new job. Its difficult though in my industry, as the company I work at is the top. People have moved into my team from other companies taking lower positions for higher pay than they were on previously. And people being hired into my role are now required to have certificates and qualifications that weren't originally required so I don't have them. So I couldn't even get my own role back. But I am actively applying now, and have rejiggled my CV to highlight different areas and skills to try and change into a slightly different field. It's crap.

I really want to reach out to Rose and Leah, grab a coffee, and just talk. To have a more dignified end to our friendship than what's been handed to us, as the company are not considering the human and just worried about there company name. But again, I keep being told the three of us are not allowed to talk. And I've been told I shouldn't thinking of having friendships at work as I need to consider the business. I have truly learnt now HR are not for the people, and I see now why people change roles, often not due to probably wanting, but because of the people, environment and management. It's easier to move away.

So advice. Do I reach out? Risk losing my Job by talking about it? Maybe not to even talk about what's happened but speak to show some peace hopefully to open up to being able to be amicable at least not be nervous around one another. Do I even show them the reports that prove I made no rumours, that the people they went to in confidence leaked what was said. That I have been off for my own mental health and not because I was saying the same stuff as Jones and Malcolm. To apologise for building a friendship in the workplace, I shouldn't have, and by crossing those circles of life and work I've made things complicated and upsetting for them both. Personally, I DO NOT want to tell rose about the r\*pe comments, I do not want to even bring up the drugs or threats in a way that I was fearful it'd happen to her, because I do not want that on her mind, I'm happy taking that to the grave. But happy to explain what was happening to me. I understand she already has an ill view of men in general due to the past, I don't want to add that on to her, she doesn't deserve it, she deserves to feel she can trust and let people in and speak to people without being anxious. She's a lovely person and off great character.

Or do I simply keep my plan to leave and hope that makes them more comfortable so till then and after, just power through and don't approach?

In the immediate, I'm at work tomorrow again. If I pass them, do I smile, nod, or just head down and pass.

**TL:DR**

* Was harassed by two colleagues at work (threats, graphic sexual fantasies, drugging threats, comments of r\*pe).
* Developed a real friendship with two women colleagues, which the harassers hated. When I finally reported it, the company mishandled confidentiality — resulting in me being grouped with my abusers.
* A false rumour about me and one of my friends (Rose) was leaked in retaliation by one of the abusers and believed by Rose as I was the one who spread it. She publicly posted hurt and anger. HR investigate and found no wrong doing and proved I didn't do it, but won't reassure Rose or tell her as it's confidential
* Now no one at work talks to me, I'm isolated, HR refuses to correct anything, and I'm trying to decide:
   * Should I reach out to Rose and Leah privately to reassure them and approach an amicable end of our friendship?
   * Or just leave quietly?

It’s been a hellish year. My ex — who I strongly believe has untreated NPD — threw everything she could at me: allegations of child neglect, insinuations of domestic violence, you name it. I was forced into supervised visits, co-parent counseling, and even temporary relocation. She caused me to lose my job and robbed me of the joys of being a new parent. It’s been an absolute nightmare — but I survived.

Despite the fact that the judge, multiple doctors, co-parent counselors, and supervised visitation monitors all disputed her claims that I’m mentally ill and unfit to parent, she refuses to let go of that narrative. It’s her way of preserving a false reality where she didn’t destroy her daughter’s family.

Sometimes, I wish I had actually done something to justify the hatred I’ve endured — cheating, lying, anything. But I didn’t. The only thing I can learn from this is: **never ignore red flags.**

In fact, everyone reading this should test their new partners at some point by telling them “No” — and watch how they react. Their response will tell you everything.

All I ever did was set a healthy boundary between my family and my MIL — and that boundary set off a chain reaction I never could have imagined. (*My MIL wanted our newborn daughter, just 48 hours old, to sleep in her room instead of with us, the parents.*)

Recently, the judge finally seemed to get fed up. My ex started demanding a parenting coordinator, claiming again, “He’s mentally ill.” Her “evidence”? That I walk a lot, drink coffee inconsistently, and — the best one — that I wear a size 10.5 shoe. You can’t make this up.

Financially, I’m wrecked. But money can be rebuilt.

The good news? I can sleep at night. I don’t have to live in fear of explaining this to my daughter one day — or to the custody evaluator, who will be forced to read through the insanity she filed in court.

The most insane part?

* My ex has spent over $180,000 trying to avoid a single conversation with me — trying to avoid even answering why she went nuclear.
* No breakup text. No phone call. No ultimatum.
* She literally paid a lawyer to break up with me and secure our child.
* She failed.
* Now she has to live with the consequences.

If you’re going through something similar: **stay strong. Document everything. Stand your ground.**

My turning point was when I tried TAG Coffee's peel and pour coffee pods and made my own latte with whole milk.

It was Legendary. Game changing. Transforming. I am now a new person... yet my wallet hasn't changed. I checked how much TAG sold those pods for and they were 2 dollars each. As a uni student I can't afford that, so here I am turning to the community for your best instant coffee suggestions that can provide me the same experience as TAGs.

I drink lattes and so far have only tried mcdonalds's latte which isn't as spectacular. NTUC sells some Starbucks options and I've seen Nescafe Gold sold in a glass jar as well but I don't know what really would taste as good as a premium 100% arabica beans you know. If I were to buy out, my budget is anything below 5 dollars. Luckin seems to have a ton of lattes too, but im not sure.

We meet once a month for roughly 2 hours. We've been meeting at a Brewed Awakenings, but we're starting to get too big for the space. Looking for somewhere with:

* Food/coffee available onsite or nearby
* Enough space for up to 15 people to meet without overcrowding the venue

I'd love to reserve a space, but I'm guessing that would cost a significant amount of money. I'd also like to support local/small businesses, if possible. Thank you for any advice!",4,1745784899.0,vancouverwa,2,0.83,False
1k9dahf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k9dahf/explore_if_the_hamilton_beach_flexbrew_trio/,Explore if the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Trio coffee maker is worth buying review!,"The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Trio 2-Way Coffee Maker, model B078BXRKST, found its way into my kitchen with promises of ultimate coffee flexibility. Sporting both a single-serve side compatible with K-Cup pods and a full 10-cup carafe option using grounds, I’ve been exploring the features of this sleek appliance daily. As someone who thrives on caffeine and enjoys a tailored brew experience, I was eager to see how it performed.

**Compact Yet Functional Design**

Immediately noticeable is its thoughtful black and stainless steel build which fits snugly under my cabinets. Measuring 13.6"" x 14.5"" x 15.13"", this setup doesn’t hog counter space, unlike my previous coffee maker and Keurig combo. The two separate water reservoirs are easily accessible, each with a see-through water window—a practical touch that eliminates the guessing game of water levels.

**Versatility in Brewing Options**

Mornings at my house are diverse. Some days I need a quick single cup, while on others, I fill the thermal carafe to fuel me through endless Zoom meetings. The machine transitions seamlessly between single-serve brewing and pot brewing. It’s a life-changing perk not to switch between different devices or settings manually. The flavor boldness option added a nice twist for days when I craved stronger coffee.

**Key Benefits**  
- Flexibility to brew single cups or a full 10-cup pot.
- Compatible with both K-Cup pods and ground coffee.
- Includes a thermal carafe that keeps coffee warm for hours.
- Separate reservoirs prevent cross-contamination between coffee modes.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Brewing a full carafe is slower than I anticipated, often taking over 12 minutes.
- The thermal carafe doesn’t maintain coffee heat as effectively as promised.
- Single-serve users must fill the reservoir each time, as there’s no large tank.

**Wake-Up Programming Makes Mornings Smoother**

Easy-Touch programming made it a breeze to set my pot of coffee to brew at dawn. It didn’t take long to program, and the joy of waking up to fresh java is unparalleled. The lack of pre-programmable single-serve brewing was a letdown, though. Someone juggling early mornings might find that feature gap frustrating.

**Is It Truly Cost-Efficient?**

Given its dual functionality, this coffee maker offers good value. Investing in one appliance that replaces two eliminates counter clutter and maximizes efficiency. While it’s slightly on the higher side in comparison to simpler machines, its features make it worth the extra for those who like options. 

**Product Competitors**

I briefly considered Keurig K-Duo Plus and Cuisinart SS-20 before deciding. While they also offer dual brewing capabilities, the Hamilton Beach takes the crown for having separate water reservoirs for each mode. This convenience avoids flavor crossover—a noticeable problem with single-reservoir competitors. However, the Keurig K-Duo Plus carafe keeps coffee slightly hotter, so those focused solely on temperature might veer that way.

**Affordable Quality**

Balancing quality and price, I would tag this machine under ""affordable quality."" While some high-end models might surpass it, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Trio punches just above its price class with additional features like reusable filters and multiple brew styles. The lack of a consistently hot carafe is its Achilles heel but does not outweigh the practical upsides.
