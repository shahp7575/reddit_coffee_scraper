I am going  back and forth between the Black vs Ash (Grey) interior. My 2008 Rav4 (current car) has fabric seats, and I have never had a car with leather, or leather-like, interior/seats. 

FWIW, I am in my 30s, rarely have passangers other then my husband,  and we are unable to have children (so no kids now or in the future). 

I am concerned about how easily the Ash SofTex gets dirty or stains with daily use, and how easy it would be to clean if there was an accidental spill (like coffee).

Alternatively, how hot would the Black SofTex interior be during the summer?? FWIW, our summers peak at the mid to upper 90s, and we do not have a garage, although we do have some shade in the driveway.

1nr27aq,https://i.redd.it/ratvovu2nirf1.jpeg,Shabbat Shalom Friends,"This isn't a race. 

Transformation doesn't happen on a schedule.

And growth can't be rushed just because the calendar says it's time.

You don't have to have all your answers figured out between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. 

You don't have to become a different person in ten days. 

You don't have to fix everything that's broken or heal everything that hurts before the gates close.

The High Holidays ask us to look inward, yes. 

To reflect, to repent, to commit to change. 

But they also teach us something quieter: 

That lasting change happens slowly, gently, one small step at a time.

So if you're overwhelmed by everything you think you should be doing or becoming right now - pause. 

Breathe. 

This Shabbat, give yourself permission to move at your own pace. 

To process what needs processing. 

To rest when you need rest. 

To let the work of becoming unfold naturally instead of forcing it.

The beauty of Shabat is that it interrupts our urgency. 

It reminds us that sometimes the most productive thing we can do is simply be present. 

To sip our coffee slowly. 

To sit with our thoughts without rushing to conclusions. 

To trust that we have enough time.

You have enough time. 

The transformation you're seeking will come - not because you pushed harder, but because you gave yourself space (and the right space) to grow.

Take your time. 

The journey transforms much more than the destination.

Shabat Shalom 💙

*August 12, 2025*

Hiya there, I’m in a bit of a pickle and don’t really know what to do here.

A few days ago, my (30f) ex’s (32m) new girlfriend (27f) texted me out of the blue and told me – first politely and then not so much – to back the fuck off and not contact my ex anymore cos, apparently, it’s disrespectful and I ‘should be over it by now’.

Some context here: My ex and I broke up roughly six years ago but we are still friends. Why? Cos we didn’t have a reason not to.
Our break up wasn’t a dramatic one – just two people who’d been together since their late teens realising that they wanted different things in life.
But since we still got along great and he had his daughter – my “niece” – who I basically helped raise we decided to stay friends.

The reason his girlfriends message surprised me as much as it did is that a) it came really out of the blue. I didn’t even know she had my number b) she has absolutely zero reason to be suspicious or anything.

My ex and I still hang out, yes, but always with either my niece or other friends. And, on occasion, we go to school events for my niece – like, when she has a performance or something.
I genuinely don’t think I’ve done anything with him one on one since…damn, since before our break up I think? The most ‘one on one’ he and I ever do is when he drops off or picks up my niece – she has a room at my place, in case that matters - and we wait for her to get her things. But that’s all.

Also: His girlfriend and I have met before at my nieces and then my ex’s birthday and she was nice both times. We didn’t talk much, just regular ‘hi, how are you, nice to meet you, that’s a lovely dress, bye’, so I didn’t think she had any issues with me.

On top of that: I’m dating someone new, too.

So yeah, I’m not sure what her deal is at all. And when she texted me, my arse was halfway to giving my ex a ring and telling him to maybe have a chat with his girlfriend cos something is definitely wrong but another part of me really doesn’t want to interfere with his relationship like that.

My ex is a good dude and, from what my niece told me and from what I’ve seen at the two birthdays, he really adores her. Like, he genuinely gets puppy eyes when he looks at her which that stoic arse man NEVER does. He deserves to be this happy, he really does.
And, most importantly, my niece likes her too. That wasn't the case with the two other girlfriends he'd had since we broke up, so this is a huge issue I need to consider, too.
Telling him would put all of this in jeopardy but like…what else am I supposed to do?

I’m defo not going to cut contact with either my niece or my ex just cos she wants me to, no fucking way, but she was rather insistent on the matter, so I don’t think she’ll leave it alone either.

My flatmate is team ‘tell him and get it over with’, but she’s, with love, a bit of a prick so I’m hesitant to take her word on anything.

># Consensus:

Not the Asshole.

Commenters tell her to sent him a screenshot.

____

># Some of the comments by OOP:

- 

That is the wildest part - she didn't even accuse me of flirting with him. Like, if she had been able to genuinely tell me what upset her then I could've cleared the air but she really just wants me gone cos she thinks exes have no business being friends.

But yeah, I think I'll have to give him a call tonight - even if he does nothing, at least he knows.

- 

*[somebody says even if she steps back, to still stay around the child]*
Oh defo. Not that I think he would drag my niece into this, he's not the type. Also: I'm pretty much the closest thing to a maternal figure she has and have been ever since she was like...two? I think? So yeah, doubt he'd take that from her. And he knows I'd fist fight him if he dared to try, lol, but I'll defo make sure to mention it!

- 

*[Somebody comments it's also a hard boundary for them to not have exes around]*
I guess that's fine, but in that case it's really silly that she's only coughing that up now. I think they've been together for a year / a year and a half.

AND she's dating someone with a kid, too, isn't an ex to be expected in that scenario? Granted, our case is a little special cos my niece's mother bailed and I'm there instead but still.

Aside from that: I can see that disrespectful thing in general but really not with my ex and I. Genuinely, the most we do is hug hello and goodbye and that's normal in my country - as in, I hugged his girlfriend too . Aside from that... I guess I usually pop by on christmas for an hour or two cos of my niece. But outside of that there's nothing that I wouldn't do with any other friend too. 

I do think she knows that, however, cos when I asked her to give me examples or a situation where I could've made her uncomfortable she couldn’t say anything. Just that I bothered her.

- 

So my ex had my ""niece"" before we got together (yes, he's a teen dad.). He and I got together about a year or so after she was born but I only got to meet her properly when she was two and a half and have been in her life ever since.

So she's his daughter, but not really related to me. The ""niece"" title just stuck cos when she was a toddler, she used to call me auntie [my name] and we kept it this way out of habit.

As for my family - he will go if my niece asks him to drive her to see my grandma or my aunt, but that's pretty much it. And it's pretty rare, too, cos I usually end up taking her. Outside of that the only contact they have is birthday wishes or whatever.

My niece, however, is really close with my folks and they consider her family, so she comes around quite often.

- 

Honestly, I'm genuinely not sure how well me making space will work. My niece is a teen by now (a young teen but still a teen) and I've been in her life since she was two and a half. 

Also: I did do all the ""mum"" things with her, I just don't have the title.  Mainly cos when my ex and I first got together I was still in my teens (he's a teen dad) and didn't feel comfortable with being called mum by anyone. The aunt/niece title just stuck. 

As for your idea: I wouldn't mind that but from what my niece told me they have a good relationship. They hang out a lot and do stuff together and my niece usually invites her along whenever she has a recital or similar, but the GF works odd hours and usually can't make it.

But yeah, I'm not opposed to working things out. It's just weird that I have to, in the first place.

>#[Update](https://np.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mozz2o/update_wibta_if_i_told_my_ex_that_his_new_gf_told/) 
*August 13, 2025, 1 day later*

Hiya again!
I thought I'd give you guys a little update in case any of you are interested.

First: I did end up calling my ex after I came back from work last night. I was insanely nervous cos I still felt (and still do feel) bad about rocking the boat but yeah, you guys were right. It should be his decision if he wants to cut me off, not his GF's.

Now, after some regular chatter I went in and told him what happened and even read him some of the messages his girlfriend had sent me.
He didn't say much as I did (not that I expected him to, that man has a daily average of 15 words. 25 if he's feeling very chatty.) and mostly just listened quietly. I couldn't gauge his reaction, so I kind of ended up rambling and mentioning some of the things you guys had advised me to - you know how he can step back if that's what he needs, I'd respect his decision on that, but how I'd appreciate it if we could keep my niece out of it and all that.

The latter part is kind of where he spoke up - mostly to snort 'you idiot' - and then he told me he already knew that she'd texted me cos my boyfriend told him (they're friends and co-workers).
My boyfriend apparently noticed that I was more upset than I wanted to let on and asked my ex to call me 'cos something happened between her [me] and your [my ex's] girlfriend'.

(Which makes sense, btw. I’ve asked my boyfriend if my behaviour with my ex was ever uncomfortable or inappropriate after the GF texted me, just to make sure I wasn’t doing something wrong without being aware of it AND I have been stewing over this mess for like, nigh a week, so yeah. Not surprised my boyfriend noticed something was up.)

My ex chose to wait until I said something myself before breaching the topic, though. My boyfriend didn't tell him what exactly happened but my ex sort of figured it was something like her telling me to cut contact.

He then, once again, told me that I'm an idiot and that I should've told him immediately, cos this wasn't on. The two of them (so he and his GF) talked about this before - even before they officially got together - and he'd made it very clear that there was no way in hell he'd be cutting me off cos 'I've been his friend before I was his girlfriend and I've stayed his friend for long after that' and cos I’m basically my nieces mum or the closest thing she has to a mum.

So, before they started dating, he told her that she’d have to be cool with that. He’d understand if she wasn’t but he’d not change his mind cos I’ve done the legwork and she hasn’t.

Now, according to him she was absolutely fine with it and even told him that she really liked me and wanted to get to know me more after the birthdays I mentioned prior, so he doesn’t know what has gotten into her.

I asked him if she mentioned something else at a latter time – like, that something I did or said made her uncomfortable or feel insecure – but he said no. She also didn't hint at anything.
And yes, I asked multiple times WITH examples just to make sure, cos, respectfully, my ex isn't great at taking hints. At all. His brain is wired stricktly forwards so anything sligthly obscure does NOT ring any bells in his wee head.

As we chattered on, still trying to work out what could’ve ticked her off, he suddenly got REALLY quiet and I was like ‘dude, you there?’ and he then said that he may have an idea what did it for her. He didn’t tell me what though cos he said it’s a conversation he needs to have with her first, so I didn’t ask further. He did assure me that it was nothing I did, though.

We pretty much left it at that and he told me he’d have a chat with her and see what’s up and, depending on what it is, he’d let me know. So now we wait.

Oh and we both kind of hope that she left it at contacting me and didn’t talk to my niece about this. She’s kind of been in a funk all week but keeps telling us it’s nothing so we kind of assumed it was hormones and/or stress and told her to take it easy. But since the dates of her bad mood and the GF messaging me line up, we’re a bit worried that the she mentioned something or asked my niece to cut me off or whatever.

Anyway, thanks for the advice you guys gave me and for telling me to just get it over with. I genuinely don’t think I would’ve done it otherwise. If I hear anything interesting, I’ll let you guys know but until then I think this is it.

Thanks!

EDIT/MORE INFO:
I think a lot of people are confused by my niece being my niece and also my ex's kid. Sorry, I should've reiterated that before things got muddled.

A short stack of facts:

My ex (32m) is a teen dad. He had my niece while he was still in (the equivalent of) high school. He and I (30f) got together roughly a year after she was born, but he only introduced me to her when she was two and a half.
Since I was still pretty young then, I wasn't super comfortable with being called 'mum', so my ""niece"" ended up calling me auntie [my name]. This stuck and she still calls me aunt today and I call her niece, but we're not related by blood.

Her bio mum is not and has never been in the picture. I did all the mum things - from potty training her to seeing most of her firsts to going to her parent teacher conferences and what not. This is why my ex says I'm the closest thing she has to a mother.

And, to finish it up: My ex and I didn't break up recently. We broke up six years ago cos we wanted different things in life. We stayed in contact cos we've always been friends first and, most importantly, cos of my niece.

These days, my niece comes to stay with me at least every other week (sometimes more, sometimes less cos my ex and I are both chill with her choosing for herself) and she has her own room at my place.

># Some of the comments by OOP:

- 

I'm fine arguing and fighting myself if no one else is involved. I do, however, genuinely hate being a bother to anyone and rocking the boat by tattling on her but yeah, at least now it's kind of off my chest and out of my hands. My ex can probably try to work it out better than I can.

- 

*[if OOP could look into niece's phone in case girlfriend sent her something upsetting]*
Generally, yes I could. And I wouldn't even need to peak, she's fine with us checking her phone after we explained that both my ex and I had out fair share of cyber bullies back in the day - the struggles of being/dating a teen dad in the late 00s - and that we're maybe a bit paranoid of that happening to her, so she's fine with that.

BUT she's with my ex right now, so I don't have access to her phone. I'll ask him to check and if, for some reason, he can't, I'll have a check myself once she comes over tomorrow. Good thinking! 

- 

*[if girlfriend said to niece that OOP doesn't want her around anymore]*
God, I sure hope not cos then I will be throwing hands. She can come at me all she likes but if she fucks with my girl, I'm done being nice.

That'd be downright crazy.  I don't care if that girl has any of my blood or not, she's family. I'd never even dream of leaving her behind. Like, I could hate my ex's guts and I'd still always be there for my niece.

*[if girlfriend made niece choose between her and OOP and girlfriend lost]*
Oh damn, pardon my french, but she'd be so fucking dumb if she actually did that. She's been with my ex (and thus in my nieces life) for like...a year or so now. That's really not a lot of time in general, but definitely not compared to me. It'd be crazy if she actually expected any decent results from that.

Yikes, I sure hope not cos then there's hell to pay. I'm not above wrestling her if need be.

- 

*[if niece was mentioned in the back off-message]*
Oh no, my niece wasn't mentioned in that conversation at all! The general context was that 'exes have no business being friends'. She didn't mention my niece once.

But, if it was about my niece too, she could've talked to me normally. I really wouldn't mind ""sharing the spot"". Quite the opposite, I'd love it if my niece had more women in her life. Especially one that is a different type of feminine than I am (which the new GF happens to be) cos more variety is always good and she could show her things that I can't.

- 

*[if girlfriend could be pregnant and lashing out]*
Oh holy shit. I did not think of that. She probably could be - I'm not exactly asking my ex about his sex life - but I'd assume that yeah, she could. But that'd be a whole arse mess cos, from what I know, my ex doesn't want more kids.

>#[Update 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nqlvbi/final_update_wibta_if_i_told_my_ex_that_his_new/) 
*September 26, 2025, about 1 1/2 months later*

Hullo everybody!

I would start off by saying something like ‘I don’t know if anyone remembers me’ but you’ve all been very vocal in my inbox this past month so I’m just going to assume that yes, some of you do.

This all got much more attention than I ever expected, so I’m honestly quite nervous to even update this cos I just know the result really isn’t what most of you wanted or were hoping for. But my boyfriend and my flatmate were having a field day with all your comments and messages - they asked me to say thanks to the person that ‘came up with the bio mum amnesia car accident theory’? I don’t know either, I stopped reading comments eventually, but they really enjoyed that one – so the two of them were basically bullying me into this.

I’m not really sure where to start so I’ll just go by what I was asked the most, I guess.

Oh and, before that I kind of feel the need to clarify…I don’t call my ex my ex irl. I call him by his name. Right? I got multiple messages asking me to stop calling him that ‘since we’re more than that at this point’ so, just to make that clear. I call him by his first name.

Okay now, first things first: We’re all fine! My niece is fine, my ex and his GF are kind of fine and I’m grand as well. Thanks for checking in and even sending us those…reddit care thingies? You know what I mean.

Then a lot of you were asking about my niece and if we ever found out what was bothering her and yes, we did.

My ex dropped off my niece at my place not long after I posted the second update (it was her turn to stay at my place) and she was still in a shitty mood just like she’d been this entire time, if not a bit worse.

So she didn’t even stay to say bye to my ex, she just stomped off into her room and holed herself up for the day. My ex asked me if I could try and have a chat with her while she stayed over cos apparently he’d tried and it didn’t go over well. I think we were both kind of on edge cos this isn’t usually her style but then again…teens will teen.

Anyway, I told him I’d try and send him on his merry way for now. It took me a couple of days to actually get to the chatting. The first few days were really…woof. It’s like I was sharing my house with a particularly pissed off velociraptor. I basically spent the entire time throwing snacks and wee little trinkets at her, hoping she’ll not bite my hand off in the process.

But eventually she cooled off enough and with some fine needling and enough ice cream to feed an army I managed to get some answers.

Good News: The GF did not talk to her. So, lower thy pitchforks, reddit, the woman is ney a witch.

Bad News: My niece did overhear the GF bad mouthing me on the phone, like some of you guessed.

The GF apparently didn’t know that my niece was home – she came home early from school and the GF didn’t hear her come in – so I doubt it was on purpose but it still happened and my niece did not take it well.

She’d been in a bad mood anyway (just normal teen-struggles, mind. Including – gods help me – boy troubles. Does anyone have a handbook on how to handle THAT!? Cos I’m not ready and since my ex took the news like a man going to war, I seriously doubt he's either.) and hearing the GF talk shit certainly didn’t help.

She really didn’t want to tell me what exactly the GF said, but it seemed to have been really below the belt. Just going the fact that my niece was angry-crying during that part of our chat.  
I didn’t pressure to tell me more since it just seemed to upset her, but I did ask her to please tell her dad what was said so that she could get it off of her chest, which she did do after both my ex and I promised that he wouldn’t tell me either.

I know that’s kind of a let down for some of you, but to be honest: I don’t really care. If she wants to talk shit, she can. I’m just happy my niece doesn’t have to carry that stuff around on her own anymore.

Now, as for my ex and his GF…difficult.

It took a while longer for that to get resolved. I actually didn’t hear anything back until quite recently and the end result is kind of…meh?

The short of it is: I was catching strays. That’s all.

My ex eventually called me and told me that much. He also said that his GF would like to talk to me personally and asked me to hear her out. Which fine, sure, I’ll do that.

So, they rocked up to my place about a week ago and we all had tea.  
Let me tell you: It was awks. The GF was really twitchy and nervous the entire time and I think we spent twenty minutes just talking about the weather before she finally managed to cough up an apology. That apology was then followed by fifty more, no matter how often I told her that it was okay and that I was more than content to just move on.

She was thankful, but she asked me if I’d let her explain herself, so I did.

And yeah, turns out she…well, she didn’t really have a reason to come at me, but she did have a reason overall for why she acted the way she did.

The first and probably biggest reason I won’t tell you, cos it goes far beyond me telling you about something I was involved in or me sitting here like ‘well she was being a bit of a c\*nt, what do I do?’. But let it be said: Something sad happened. It wasn’t anyone’s fault. Nobody did anything wrong. It was just something tragic that happens to some people and couldn’t be avoided. That’s all.

The second reason was that she apparently had a minor dispute with my ex about…kind of me, I guess? So, from what the two of them told me, the GF texted my ex not long before she first messaged me and asked him if he could pick her up from work cos she wasn’t feeling well. He told her that yes, he would, but it’d take him a while since he was about to drop my niece off at my place.

Now, what he meant by that was: The drive will take longer than usual cos \[my name\] lives at the other end of town.

What she took it as was: \[My name\] is more important than you right now, so you’ll have to wait.  
(Honestly, I do not get it either. I wasn’t even the reason he was coming over, so I’m not sure why that is how she took it. But okay, fine, she was in a state cos of the sad thing, maybe that’s just how it felt at the time.)

And the third reason is that she feels kind off like the odd one out in my ex’s (and thus partially my) friend group, which was making her feel insecure. And that’d be fine, it’s human, but her reason for feeling like the odd one out was apparently that she’s straight and most of us are not. That surprised both my ex and I cos…yeah nah, most of our friends are, in fact, straight.  
In our collective friend group, there’s just me, my boyfriend, my ex (we’re all bi) and one gay chap + his boyfriend. The rest are straight as hell. Like ‘I majored in business, have a wife, a dog and 1 ½ children’ type straight lol. So yeah, we didn’t know how she got that idea and she was honestly very rattled once we’d cleared that up.

All of that then collided into one big ball of frustration and that frustration was then aimed at the easiest target – me. So, she snuck into my ex’s phone, got my number, and told me to back off.

According to her, she immediately regretted it but didn’t know how to fix it until my ex put her on the spot. She also reiterated that she really isn’t bothered by me and that she was being truthful when she’d told my ex that she’d like to get to know me more.

I told her that that was fine by me – yes, this is me cutting her some slack. She overreacted and made a mistake. Shit happens. – but that she might want to try and talk to my niece before that relationship completely evaporated. But once she’s settled that, I’m down to meeting for coffee or hanging out as a group with my niece or whatever.

And that is really kind of where we left it.

I DID ask my ex where his head’s at while the GF was off to the loo and how he’s feeling and he told me he’s not quite sure yet. He does see where she’s coming from and he’s happy that she owned up to her mistakes and wanted to apologise and all that, but he’s miffed that she even reacted like that in the first place. You know, that she'd rather sneak into his phone and then b\*tch at me instead of just talking to him.  
Oh and he’s extremely pissed off about the things she said about me (when my niece overheard her, that is).

I didn’t ask him more than that cos we’d promised my niece but I did tell him to not let that be his deciding factor, if anything.  
Apart from that, I didn’t pry for more.

And that is pretty much it, guys!

Sorry that I can’t deliver the dramatic story filled with big reveals, harsh realisations, and angry break ups but alas, real life tends to be a bit boring and shit just ends with people having a wee chat over tea.

My boyfriend offered to act out a dramatic scene where I break up with him cos I ‘realised I’m still in love with my ex’ in case anyone is interested, lol, but unless that’s it, this is where we part ways.

Thanks for sticking around and for all the advice you’ve given me! I really didn’t expect my little issue would get this much attention, so here’s to me never underestimating reddit again.

Have a lovely day/night wherever you are!

1nr2103,https://www.reddit.com/r/Best_Buds_n_Strains/comments/1nr2103/i_winterized_3_flower_rosins_to_see_if_they_would/,I winterized 3 flower rosins to see if they would work better in vape cartridges and disposables,"I decided to post this intel here in case folks were using flower rosin in their vape mods. If this is common knowledge or practice, I’m sorry for wasting peoples’ time. I recently winterized flower rosin. The main purposes were to see how flower rosin reacted to the ethanol wash and to see if the end product would work better in my homemade carts and disposables. If you have made cannabis carts before, you probably know that each substance works differently, and flower rosin can be the trickiest because of how plant matter and particulate fires in the atomizer, and in turn, clogs the cart. I dissolved x amount of 3 flower rosins separately in 200 proof ethanol, let them sit in the freezer overnight, then strained and filtered through coffee filters 3x. I proceeded to evaporate off the remaining ethanol on the stirrer hotplate, and finish in the purge chamber. It purged off the last little bits well at -29hg. I didn’t bother with the Buchner and vac pump setup for these experiments, but that would have sped up by the process. End weight was down by 16% which felt right, especially due to it being flower rosin. I will add, that I had already decarbed each flower rosin sample prior to adding to the ethanol. The end result worked much better when injecting into the cartridges and disposables. All of the liquid was tan to light amber, but not completely transparent. There was a noticeably diminished taste that I attributed to the decarb and that terpenes are water soluble and were trapped and separated during winterization. Finally, upon trying the carts, the high was very powerful and clean, and the cartridges all fired well. I used 1g/1ml cart tanks, but 0.5g would have worked better. Many carts can only handle flower rosin in 0.5g due to the viscosity and particulate in flower rosin. The flower rosin in the cartridges was slightly harsher than vaping it through the Banger rig or Puffco.",1,1758894983.0,Best_Buds_n_Strains,0,1.0,False
1nr20z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1nr20z8/my_stimulants_dont_work_anymore/,My stimulants don’t work anymore,"I’m in a very frustrating situation. I have severe combination ADHD. I started taking Adderall in 2019 for my ADHD, and it absolutely worked wonders. It was exactly what I needed, and all was well. I ended up moving over to methylphenidate because I moved to the UK end of 2021 (I’m from Canada originally), and they didn’t have Adderall. I tried it for a few months and it worked, but it made me feel super sick so I stopped taking it. I moved back to Canada a year later (end of 2022) and didn’t restart stimulants until a year after I had come back (it’s 2024 at this point), and since restarting my stimulants 2 years later after my stimulant break, they haven’t been working. I’ve tried brand name and generic adderall, I’ve tried vyvanse, I’ve tried concerta— none of them work. I’ve even tried coffee, and still nothing. I don’t get any psychological effects, nor do I get any physical effects like a decrease in appetite or increased heart rate. Absolutely nothing. I remember having a week where I drank 64 oz of coffee every day to get myself to be focused and alert, and still nothing. I don’t know what changed in the 2-ish years I stopped taking my stimulants, but something’s definitely up either with me or my meds. My doctors are stumped as well as to why my meds aren’t working at all anymore. I heard that some people have been experiencing a decrease in effectiveness of their stimulants since the 2022 shortage, but I don’t know if that’s the reason considering not everyone is going through this. I’m hesitant to try non stimulants because I’ve heard a lot of stories of people really disliking them, but I guess I have no choice. How does one manage symptoms of severe ADHD without medication?

1nr20jr,https://i.redd.it/frrnjmgb7irf1.jpeg,MCA i tried this ice cream-coffee combo habang nag rerelapse,"SORRY IN ADVANCE FOR THE LONG POST

So nagkaroon ako ng campus crush at alam nya na crush ko sya dahil nag confess ako sa kanya last Christmas. This goes on for the next 6 months, giving her gifts and a drawing of her whenever we see each other at campus. Then last June, nagkaroon ako ng lakas ng loob na magconfess ulit sa kanya na what I felt for her is not just an infatuation, but a real love. I am in love with her na. Then, I asked her kung pwede kame mag meet in person and she said yes.

We went to Uncle John's and that was our very first date. Pinag usapan namen yung tungkol sa nararamdaman ko hanggang sa nag change topic na. We started to get comfortable with each other. Pagkatapos non, nagsimula kame mag chat araw araw at syempre nasundan ng 2nd date. That's when I asked her kung pwede manligaw and pumayag sya. We chat everyday, send each other pictures, funny vids, voice messages, random questions, late night talks, we were so happy or rather, I was happy. Then, our conflict started.

Naging anxious ako sa sarili ko, naging mahiyain ako sa kanya, madaming unsaid feelings and thoughts sa kanya at napapansin nya yon. Gusto kong ayusin yon kaya niyaya ko sya magkita last August para mag apologize at mag explain pero little did i know, ayun na pala ang huling pagkikita namen. Nag confess sya sakin non na ayaw na nya at pinatigil na nya ko manligaw. I tried making things to work out pero ayaw na nya daw talaga. My heart shattered and di na napigilang umiyak in front of her. Even though 2 months lang ako nanligaw sa kanya, sobrang sakit pa din till now dahil sya yung unang babaeng niligawan and i fell in love with her not just because she's beautiful and smart, but because of her simplicity and personality.

So anong connect ng ice cream at coffee combo?? Last July, nag promise kame na itatry namin yan kapag may time kame **(naging busy kase pareho sa pag aasikaso ng OJT at thesis eh)** pero hindi na natuloy so ngayon, I decided na i try yan sa Uncle John's dahil kanina lang nalaman kong inunfollow na nya ko sa lahat ng socmed accs nya and it hurts kase dun ko nalang sya makakakuha ng update sa kanya. Then, I wonder, mas ayos na din yon para maka move on agad ako sa kanya. Ni-try ko yung ice cream-coffee combo kanina at di na naman mapigilang umiyak dahil naalala ko yung mga masasyang memories kasama sya and our first date sa Uncle John's. Wala man lang nagsabi sakin na ganito pala kasakit ang gantong short-term situationship HAHAHAHAHA.

To You, Riane **(her nickname)**, If you happen to read this, I hope you're happy and doing great at your PT, go get that degree and license. Please know that I don't hold any grudges against you because i understand your reason and I don't mind unfollowing me on socmed. I'm sorry I couldn't be the man you wanted. Thank you for making me happy and to have you as the first girl i experienced courting and truly loved for who she is. And not that I'm still hoping, but when the time is right and fate bring us together again, I'm still here, waiting for you. 

I love you.

I knew nothing of its reputation nor of anything ""torrid or horrible"" having taken place there.

In my lifetime, I have worked for several hotel/motel chains and timeshare resorts. I have seen just about anything and everything you could imagine. From strangers bonding after being caught in the crossfire of a deranged gunman to witnessing a suicide jumper to helping couples happily celebrate weddings, anniversaries, and other special occasions. I have also experienced things of the strange variety. Some explainable and some no so much. This one is the latter.

I, also, don't scare easily.

I like to travel, and a few years back I decided to take a trip to to the Blue Ridge mountains. I didn't really plan out much other than where I wanted to stop along the way. This trip was a solo camping trip. I've done it before. No biggie. I'm well armed when I travel so if anything were to ""jump out"" at me in the dark, well, it would probably be shot on sight. I made reservations at various campsites along the way, making sure I had nightly accommodations for a site not too far from the main road. (Just in case I needed to get out quickly.)

I left after work on a Friday and had been travelling about 5 hours and was just on the outskirts of Bluefield, WV. I decided to get a hotel room for the night, and after riding around for about 20 minutes, I came across one of those old Mom-and-Pop motels. It had 20 rooms, all with outside entrances, but it was clean on the outside and the parking lot well lit. There was a man, 40ish, working the desk, and he seemed a bit surprised to see someone at that time of the night. He was average size, attractive, and very polite. He told me the hotel was built by his grandfather in the 60s during the ""free love"" era so the rooms were still decorated in the 60s style. He said he took over operations a couple years back and that he was a former highway patrol officer that was injured on duty, so that's why he was running the motel. He put me in room #7, one that was far enough away from the ice and vending machines but situated where I could see the front desk and he could keep an eye out on my car during the night. I never got any creeper vibes from him so I took the room. The rate was cheap for a double so I checked in, got my key, and went on to my room.

There were 5 other cars in the lot, and I assumed one belonged to the owner, so that would be 4 other guests. Rooms 4 and 10 each had a car at the door which made them spaced out perfectly for comfort.

I grabbed my bag and went in and it was just as he described. 1960s. I didn't expect the room to be so clean and well maintained and it had a full kitchenette complete with small 2 burner stovetop, small oven, microwave, mini fridge, etc. The decor was orange bedspread with clean white sheets, no stains on the mattresses and no bed bugs, thank God! Dark panelled furniture, tan carpet in good shape, and orange/green/brown wall paper in some sort of funky swirl pattern. They even had dishes and pots and pans in the cabinet. I realized this was a place that people could rent long-term if needed. Different but pretty cool.

I unpacked and after a hot shower, I called the front desk to inquire about open restaurants in the area. I was told there was a 24 hr cafe a couple miles up the highway that had good food and great coffee, but there was no delivery service so I'd have to go there. No problem. After getting a couple of suggestions, I called in my order and picked it up 15 minutes later bringing it back to the room. The smell was making my mouth water and it looked and tasted even better. I settled on chicken fried steak over homemade mashed potatoes with gravy, fried okra, field peas and collards with cornbread on the side. I also got a little side salad with fresh tomatoes, red onions, and cucumbers tossed in Italian dressing. For dessert, I got one of the biggest and best servings of homemade blueberry cobbler I've ever eaten. Oh, and a large coffee to go. I ate like I was starving with plenty left over for lunch the next day.

So, this is when things start to get interesting. After eating, I put the leftovers in the fridge and went to brush my teeth, but my toiletries bag was not on the bathroom counter and neither were my things. This made my skin crawl as I remember putting all of my things away and this includes putting my personal stuff on the counter. Ok, maybe I was more tired than I thought, so I looked for my bag and found it sitting on the floor beside the bed. I got it, pulled out my toothbrush and paste, brushed my teeth, and washed my face, then off to bed.

I guess I had been asleep about an hour when someone knocked on my door. I startled me and I thought I might be dreaming when the knock happened a second time. I looked out the window and a young woman, long blonde hair, thin, 20ish, was standing there. I spoke thru the door and asked her what she wanted. She asked if she could use my phone and I told her no, to go to the front desk. She looked around but never directly at me, staring at her thru the window. She turned to the right and walked out of view.

Now, I'm no spring chicken but I'm no fool either. Asking to use someone's phone to gain access to a room is as old as the book it was written in. I wasn't about to open that door. I called the front desk and told the guy (turns out his name is Paul) what happened and he paused before speaking. This was our exchange:

Me: Hi. This is room 7 again. A young blonde woman just knocked on my door and asked to use my phone. I told her no and sent her to the office.

Paul: Hi. You can call me by my name. It's Paul. You say a woman knocked on your door? How long ago?

Me: Just now. I called you as soon as she walked away. She turned towards the office. I saw her thru the window.

Paul: Hmmm. Well, I'm outside. Standing beside my car smoking, actually, and I haven't seen anyone outside. Look out your window and you'll see me at the office beside the Jeep.

I peeked and sure enough, there he was, taking a drag of a cigarette while on the phone.

Me: Ok, that's weird.

Paul: Can you tell me what she had on and I'll keep an eye out in case she shows up again. We do have a few homeless drug addicts in the area and they can disappear quick if turned away. They're sneaky like that. She may be one of them.

I described her and remembered my toiletries bag.

Me: Oh, there's one more thing. After coming back from the diner, I found one of my bags sitting beside the bed on the floor but I had put all my things away before I left. Do you know if anyone may have come in here while I was gone?

Paul: No. It'd be hard to do with having traditional keys and all. If we had those electronic locks with keycards I would say it's possible, but the only other key to your room is here on my keyring and that's hooked to my belt loop. I promise you I didn't go in but I'll look at the security cameras and let you know something in the morning. Was anything missing?

Me. No, nothing missing, just disturbing. Okay, well, thanks Paul. I'm going back to bed. I'll see you in the morning.

I hung up and decided it was lack of sleep getting the better of me, so I turned back in.

I'm not sure what time it was when I was awakened by someone, or something, sitting on the bed. At first I thought I was sliding off the bed but then I felt the dip in the mattress behind me and it suddenly got cold on my backside. I felt the covers move like someone pulling up a sheet. Then a cold hand on my right hip. I froze. I mean, I literally froze! How the hell did someone get into my room? Was it Paul? Did he use his key and slip in without waking me? How did anyone get in and not wake me? I'm a light sleeper. Did that strange girl get in? I can't tell if it's male or female. WTF! Terror had gripped me. A cold sweat beaded on my upper lip and forehead. My heart felt like it was beating in my throat. I started shivering from the cold on my back. Then, I heard it. Faintly, but I heard every word.

""You're warm. I like this.""

I eased my hand under my pillow, grabbed my 9mm Glock, screamed bloody murder, threw off the covers, jumped up and fired two shots into the mattress. I then scrambled to get the lights on and ... nothing. No one there. Just two smoking black holes where I shot the bed. I looked everywhere. Under the bed, in the bathroom... nothing. I reached for the door and the dead bolt was still engaged. No one had entered my room. So WTF was in bed with me?

Pounding on the door took me out of my daze and I opened if to find Paul standing there with a gun in his hand. I told him what happened and he walked me to the office. A man came out of room 4 looking quite disheveled having been rudely awakened from his sleep. Paul spoke to him and he went back into his room.

Once in the office, Paul offered me a shot of whiskey, which I gladly accepted. He then told me he had something interesting to show me on the CCTV footage. He had gone through it from when I pulled in to the present time in the office. He fast forwarded some of it but not fast enough to lose track of the time as it rolled by. You can see me pull in, go into the office, us chatting, me checking in and going to my room. About 30 minutes later I leave the property and come back in 17 minutes from the diner. You can see me get out of the car with the bag of food and my coffee. An hour goes by and you see Paul walk out and light a cigarette, stopping to lean on the side of his Jeep, then me pull open the curtains on my window. You can see me looking out but there is no one at the door. No one ever approached the door. However, there was a faint little orb that floated into view, coming from down the walkway and hovering just outside my door. I could've been a bug, I don't know, but I know the timing was perfect for whatever it was. Then poof, the orb is gone. Blinked out. I then move from the window and Paul pulls his cellphone from his pocket and answers. A minute later I'm back at the window and he waves to me. Paul hangs up, goes back inside, and I close the curtains. That was when I went to bed.

The footage now shows 3:17 am and Paul points at the screen. The orb is back but this time it doesn't blink out but turns and disappears into my room's door. What felt like an eternity while it was happening, only took 3 minutes from start to finish. You can see 2 very faint, but visible, light flashes behind the curtains. That would be me firing the gun. Then Paul running out of the office with gun drawn, heading towards my room. The rest you know.

My head was spinning. I didn't know what to make of what I just saw. Paul and I sat there in silence while the time ticked by, not moving, not bothering to speak. Paul got up and poured us another whiskey. I drank it as fast as the first one, reveling in the slow burn from my throat to my stomach. We sat there, staring at each other, not knowing who should speak first or what to say. Paul broke the silence.

Paul: Well. I'm not sure what I just saw. I've seen some crazy shit in my work in highway patrol but I've never seen anything like that. What do you make of that little light? It could be a bug of some sort.

Me: Orb. It's called an orb. I'm not sure what to make of it. I could be a bug but it's not the time of year for lightening bugs but any bug flying by could catch a reflection off the lights. I just don't know. What I do know is that the orbs appear when my experiences occurred and that's just a little too coincidental for me.

Paul: I don't believe in coincidences.

Me: Hmm. I know it sounds crazy but it could be ghosts. I mean, you did say homeless people like to wander up and who knows where they sleep or what is going on in the woods. People die every day and hauntings do happen.

Paul: I don't know about that but whatever it was, it was strange. I'd have to experience it myself before I call it a ghost. No one has died in that room that I'm aware of and besides, if they did, I would think someone would have reported something before now. You're the first I know of.

Me: Well, whatever it was, it was enough to spook me into shooting your mattress. Sorry about that. I'll pay for the mattress.

Paul: Yeah, that would be appreciated. I'll give you another room if you want. Just promise me you won't shoot up another one. We don't exactly keep spare new mattresses in the stockroom.

I laughed but declined his offer. We traded information and I told him to charge the mattress to my credit card, which he did. After getting directions to the closest national park campsite, I went back to the room to pack up. It was quiet when I entered so I moved as quickly as possible. I was ready to vacate those premises for sure! I gathered my bag and leftovers from the fridge, and after returning the key to Paul and shaking his hand, I hit the road again. Pulling out of that parking lot, it felt like the weight of bricks was lifted from my shoulders. I was eager to get to my destination and eager to leave the Bates motel behind.

I still think of that place from time to time, wondering if Paul has had any other complaints about strange visitors and bed mates. I will never know what caused those things to happen but I do know from now on, I'll take my chances with ""things that go bump in the night"" at a campsite. Bears and drunks I can handle.

Consider this my contribution to that fund, a case study on why the execution of this 'boring' stack is everything.

So, story time: I worked with someone (I’m a functional nutritionist) who’d been on vitamin D for months but her labs barely budged. She also had cramps, low energy, and restless sleep. Instead of just bumping her D3 higher, we looked at cofactors. That’s when we found she was also low in magnesium. We added Mg ( \~300–400 mg/day) + K2 (MK-7, \~40-60 mcg/day) alongside her usual D3. Within weeks her cramps eased, her sleep normalized, and her follow-up labs showed her D finally climbing. 

I noticed something similar myself. I used to crash late in the afternoon and even coffee didn’t help much. After stacking the trio, my energy recovery smoothed out and I didn’t feel wired/tired anymore,  
  
The science behind it is pretty elegant:

* Magnesium is required for vitamin D metabolism, both 25-hydroxylase and 1α-hydroxylase (the enzymes that convert D3 -> 25(OH)D ->1,25(OH)2D) are Mg-dependent. If you’re low, D3 hits a ceiling no matter how much you dose. High-dose D can also drain magnesium faster.  
* K2 (esp. MK-7) carboxylates osteocalcin + matrix Gla protein, directing calcium into bone/teeth instead of arteries/soft tissue. Without K2, you can end up with higher serum calcium but worse long-term mineral balance.  
* D3 alone ramps calcium absorption, but if Mg and K2 aren’t there to balance the pathways, you may still feel the “low D” symptoms despite high serum levels.  

Dosage-wise, most clinical trials showing benefit with D3 use 2000–5000 IU/day but many people megadose way higher. In those cases, magnesium (at least 300–400 mg, ideally) and K2 (40–60 mcg MK-7) look almost mandatory to prevent imbalances.

I see a lot of folks here on 10k+ IU of D daily. Anyone else notice better outcomes when stacking Mg + K2 instead of pushing D alone?

You know that moment when you open your car door and a granola bar wrapper flutters out onto the driveway? I reached my breaking point with that. My passenger seat footwell was a tragic museum of coffee cup sleeves and crumpled receipts. It wasn't just messy; it felt chaotic every time I got in to drive.



I finally caved and bought a simple, fabric car trash can that hangs from the headrest. It was one of those ""why didn't I do this years ago"" purchases. It just sits there, unobtrusively containing the chaos. Now, instead of shoving trash into the door pocket, there's a designated spot. It’s a tiny change, but it makes the whole car feel so much more orderly.



Here's a weird fact I learned: the average American spends about an hour a day in their car. That’s a lot of time to potentially generate crumbs and trash! Having a dedicated container honestly reframes that time from being a source of clutter to something more manageable. It’s a small win for my sanity.



It’s not a glamorous product, but it solved a real, daily annoyance. The best part is emptying it; it’s so satisfying to just pull the bag and toss it, knowing the car is reset to a clean state. No more rogue apple cores rolling under the brake pedal.

Testing out the BELLA 17610 toaster has been an everyday adventure for me in the kitchen. From the moment I unboxed it, the elegant sage color caught my eye. Its stainless steel construction with a matte finish gives it a premium, modern look that blends right into my countertop. Compact and lightweight, it doesn’t hog counter space, which matters most in my already cluttered kitchen.

**Compact and Thoughtful Design**  
The toaster’s design truly surprised me. It is sleek, compact, and fits easily into small or crowded kitchens. Measuring about 6 inches deep and 10 inches wide, it’s not going to dominate your countertop. Despite its smaller profile, it has wide slots that comfortably accommodate thick bagels and even artisan bread. I noticed the high lift lever, which is a small addition but incredibly useful for grabbing smaller slices of bread without burning my fingers.  

[Check BELLA 17610 deals on Amazon now.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0b135nqqz/)  

**User-Friendly Features**  
Operating the toaster is straightforward—it’s almost as if BELLA had people like me in mind, who are groggy before coffee. With just a few buttons and a high lift lever, it feels intuitive. The three presets—defrost, reheat, and cancel—simplify the process further. Honestly, I didn’t even need to open the manual to get started! I’ve been playing around with the six browning levels, which let me toast bread or bagels exactly the way I like them, from a light crisp to a rich golden brown with just the perfect crunch.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact design works well for small kitchens.  
- Wide slots handle bagels and thick bread with ease.  
- High lift lever makes it simple to retrieve smaller items.  
- Six browning options offer customized toasting.  
- Anti-jam and auto shut-off feature for safe operation.  

**Performance and Versatility**  
The performance of this toaster has been top-notch. At 900 watts, it heats up quickly and evenly. Whether you’re popping in a muffin top, bagel, or even frozen waffles, it serves up a reliable toast every time. I noticed how the auto-centering guides ensure every slice receives an even browning. I’ve toasted everything from croissants to thin sandwich bread, and it manages them all with consistent results.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Not everything is perfect about this toaster, and a couple of things did stand out.  
- The maximum browning level might feel a bit intense for some users, so stay below 5 to avoid accidental charring.  
- The lightweight design means it moves slightly when pushing down the lever; I had to hold it steady.  

**Other Options**  
It’s worth mentioning a few peer products. For instance, the Cuisinart CPT-122 and Breville BTA720XL toasters are also strong contenders in this price range. While Cuisinart offers more advanced features like a countdown timer, I found its bulkier design less appealing for compact spaces. The Breville model excels in design but costs significantly more. Comparing these, the BELLA stands out for its affordability and thoughtful basics, though it lacks the high-tier extras.  

**Quality for Price**  
When it comes to its price tag, this toaster punches above its weight. It provides essential features that work seamlessly for the average household without veering into overcomplicated bells and whistles. The six browning settings and safety functions like the auto shut-off are impressive in this value range. If you’re looking for a practical appliance that looks great and doesn’t break the bank, this one deserves a spot in your kitchen.

1nr1ka9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nr1ka9,A night at the Wright Family Ranch in Utah,"On the third night of our overlanding trip, we camped on the Wright Ranch, just outside Zion National Park in Utah. We had hoped to find dispersed camping during our two-week work and vacation trip, but we suspected that the sites near Zion would be crowded.

That proved true. As we drove in at dusk along the back roads, every patch of open BLM land was filled with RVs, vans, and cars packed tightly together, with little sense of privacy. The ranch was not expensive, though it did require a reservation, and it was good to support a local farm with a storied history. The Wright family's Utah ranching history spans over 150 years, dating back to the mid-1800s and the Mormon migration, and still functions today as a massive ranch.

Our chosen site sat on the edge of Black Wash Canyon. No one else was nearby; the only sounds were the wind, coyotes in the distance, and the occasional cowbell. By morning, the temperature hovered just above freezing despite it being late May. We woke to a moody but beautiful landscape, with cattle grazing in the distance.

After a quick breakfast and coffee, we joined an exhaustive horseback ride across the ranch with just two other campers and Bill Wright. The trail wound along the rim of Black Wash Canyon and climbed to a viewpoint overlooking Smith Mesa, offering wide, dramatic views that made the effort worthwhile.",18,1758893806.0,overlanding,3,0.95,False

Everyone's talking about giving up coffee or pizza, but a guide I read dove deeper into the **gear** you *need* to protect your weekend chill.

It argues that to truly maximize your downtime, there are three categories of ""Smart Buys"" that are non-negotiable. I totally agree:

1. **Pure Immersion:** They argued you **must keep** high-quality **noise-cancelling headphones**. They're right. No amount of soft blankets can save your zen if you're constantly distracted by loud neighbors. This tech creates a true escape.
2. **Physical Anchor:** The next non-negotiable? A **premium, luxury throw blanket.** It sounds simple, but a truly great blanket is the fundamental basis for comfort—turning your couch into a five-star retreat.
3. **Seamless Entertainment:** Finally, you **must keep** a fast **4K streaming stick**. No one wants buffering or clunky interfaces interrupting their movie night. It's the essential gateway to all your digital entertainment.

That article then hit me with the *real* elimination challenge. Forget those tech buys—you have to ditch one of these core weekend indulgences for good:

**The FINAL Elimination Round:**

* **Coffee** (No more caffeine kick)
* **Pizza** (No more cheesy goodness)
* **Your Smartphone** (No more apps, internet, or texting)
* **Sweet Chocolate** (No more candy bars or desserts)
* **Weekend Lie-ins** (No more sleeping past 7 a.m. on Saturdays or Sundays)

This is brutal. I think I'd have to let go of **Sweet Chocolate** because I need the others for basic survival (and I can find other sweet things!).

What's your non-negotiable keeper among the *gear*, and which of the five core indulgences is the **one that has to go**? Let's settle this!

Nung nagkakilala kami she was a bit chubby, and akala niya I’d be turned off by that, but honestly, I never cared.

It never bothered me. 

But nung tumagal she kept gaining more and more weight until she became obese. Even then, it wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. Gusto ko pa rin siya and I kept reassuring her whenever she felt insecure that I still loved her. But it’s not just about her weight, it’s actually about her health.

Nakaka worry na routine niya. She eats excessively, minsan may midnight snacks pa na malalaki either rice meal or noodles, and sometimes may soda pa or coffee bago matulog late at night. She sleeps at 4 a.m. most of the time. Habang ako health-conscious and disciplined sa routine so, so it’s hard for me to see her like this. I’ve tried bringing it up gently, but she always brushes me off or says it’s her problem to deal with. She admits she knows she has to change, but nothing happens and hindi ko alam kung kailan niya plano kumilos.

I’m getting out of the Army in about 1.5 years and planning to rent in Chicago for 1–2 years before buying something. I want something budget-friendly that doesn’t need to be spacious since it’s temporary.

**My situation:**
- Still have my pre-Army job in Aurora (hybrid, 2–3 days/week in office)

- Have a car, willing to do up to ~1 hour commute to Aurora

- Want good public transit access for getting around the city

- Eventually want to buy property, but for now I just need something affordable (studio/1-bed is fine)

**Lifestyle & hobbies:**
Running, working out, reading, cooking, trying new restaurants, martial arts (judo/kung fu), coffee shops, random bookstores, museums, architecture tours, visiting temples/meditation centers, cultural events, running trails, farmers markets, emphasis on diversity 

**Shopping needs:**
I am a foodie. So I would like access to Trader Joe’s, Patel Brothers, H Mart, farmers markets. I also checked out Gangnam Market and 88 Marketplace when home on leave and said to myself “this could fix me.”

**Neighborhoods I’m considering:**
- Logan Square
- Pilsen
- Uptown
- Avondale
- South Loop

**Questions for locals:**
- Does this breakdown sound right to folks who know these areas? Any major pros/cons I’m missing?
- Are these realistic commute times to Aurora?
- Any of these areas particularly good/bad for martial arts gyms or classes?
- Best bets for finding Buddhist temples/meditation communities?
- Am I overlooking any neighborhoods that might be a better fit?

This is all new to me — I was living at home before the Army — so any insight would be greatly appreciated!

I don't like to shout or yell ,or hate.i just want to love everyone even the people who hate me ,why don't you love me ?am i not someone who can be loved, is my life doomed ,why do you think I'm someone you can hate ?i would still want you to be happy with your life , achieve your goals,and do all the things you love, i could never really hate someone fully, maybe just a little bit because I'm my mothers bitter daughter ,i have a lot of darkness inside my mind.the thing is Hate is such an ugly word ,i don't wanna associate myself with that uglyyyy word
Sometimes i think i wanna be left alone for the rest of my life, sometimes i wish company of an old friend, sometimes i wish the world ended ,and the land beneath my legs crumble as i am left helpless,maybe I'll take deep breaths as  i suffocate but ultimately I'll sigh of relief that I'll no longer be a pawn in the mortal word that'll eventually destroy my perception of life and love,and make me old ,gray and wrinkly , that'll drain my energy and make me weak and slow,my organs won't work as good as they did when i was 17 and was the happiest I've even been in my life, maybe the life after the destruction will be less of a burden to me ,and Will be kind to me than my mother ever has ever been.maybe then i can finally sit in my living room and play my weird and offputting songs on speaker, and love the person who loves me back, and won't take my love for granted, I'll come home to a place where I'll matter,and where my presence bring joy and laughter ,where i can be my most authentic self and still be loved and cherished, where i don't have to pretend to be someone else i am not ,and have my fluid faith in god. There I'll love god as i intend and won't have to perform like in a very strict drama . I'll do my chores without having to submit to the duties as a woman in a patriarchal society,where  me and my lover will raise happy children and I'll be free of being cast as an evil and wicked woman who ruined someone elses life.

I won't have to walk the way they showed me and I'll willingly walk through the thorn and bushes if it means I can choose my own path,for once I'll be in charge of my own life,even if that meant pain and suffering, I'll gladly accept it because it means i can endure it when i choose it, it'll be less painful to me than walking through flowers of which scent i despice.

Maybe the lover of my dream is no one , sometimes i think i want me all for myself, I'll make my coffee the way i like, I'll make ugly sweaters for myself and still like me , I'll be silly and sing wrong lyrics of my overplayed  favourite song and still play that again the next morning, I'll bake myself bread and eat it even if it was trashy, I'll water my plants even if I don't know if it can withstand the amount,coz what is love that is measured and given . I'll rewatch an old movie i thought was a fever dream, I'll love it all over again, I'll look up the one actor that caught my eye,maybe I'll just lay on my bedroom floor thinking about a poem i can write from the feeling I had from the film.

I believe that my SIBO started as a result of food poisoning while living in Asia, and it got significantly worse after I took antibiotics for an ear infection.

Anyways, I wanted to share the #1 remedy for my constipation: every night, I **soak 2-3 tbsp of whole chia seeds in water**. I let them sit for about 5 minutes so that the chia seeds puff up, and then I drink and **swallow them whole** (don't chew!). In the morning, I drink coffee on an empty stomach.

Ever since I started doing this, I have 1-2 BMs per day.

My theory is that I by swallowing them with water, I am creating a kind of ""gel"" that is pushing everything in my gut down. Please don't try this if you have any issues swallowing - you don't want the chia seeds to get stuck in your throat and expand there.

PS. Here are my SIBO test results if anybody is curious. I'm not sure if I'm hydrogen-dominant, methane-dominant, or both.

In Yakutia during the reign of Chernenko we were lucky to have a radio that functioned, though it was used mostly by my father. It was an Ham radio my father had tinkered with, to be able to receive FM bands because the only stations that would come in were state radio he rigged it to be able to change to illegal stations. He loved American music and the BBC news, I can fondly remember him smoking his pipe with the repurposed radio headphones on. He’d nod gravely then-puff
-then listen intently, then nod again-puff. 

Until the program had finished, then he would switch back to state radio and let my brother and I listen to music if we had completed our days studies. There was no local school but we had been sent to the internaty for our education and our father, who disagreed with most of the Soviet Unions practices, encouraged us to continue our education outside of school grounds.

The summertime in Yakut was as brutal as the winters, the heat and humidity from the melted snow would suck the life out of you as you stepped outside. The mosquitoes would lay eggs as soon as spring came and by summer, swarms would come and suck whatever life the heat did not take. Most days the sun would already be high by 5AM, and it would not go back down until late in the evening. Even then it would never fully set. The mountains would always be in a twilight that would plague my eyes. I enjoyed the dark, I always have. The peace of nothing is tranquility in motion.  

I had been sitting in such peace with my eyes covered and blinds shut when my brother asked me a question, “Do you think father hates us?”

“What?” I asked, unsure if I heard the question correctly. 

“Do you think he hates us?” 

The previous winter had been hard, my mother had been struck with an unknown illness, and traveling to a larger settlement was impossible. The doctor at the Feldsher station could only do so much.  When she passed my father followed tradition and made her a memorial in the snow, since he couldn’t dig a grave until summer. She laid in the ice shed, wrapped in my father’s arms nightly. We had been at internaty when my father had gotten a message through to the school. I didn’t even get to say goodbye.

The day that the ground was soft enough to dig the grave came, and my father could not bear to part with her. It took my uncle, my brother and I to hold him back as her family came to bury her.  I will never forget the sound of my father’s wail, “My love, my sunshine, my warmth” he screamed. 

He cried for days and nights on end until he could cry no more. Then as all of life does after death, he moved on. 

Life was brutal, it took no breaks and neither did we. My father had been educated at Bauman University, an extremely prestigious honor for a country boy like himself. Unfortunately he had gained the disdain of a professor with friends higher in the union, and when he had graduated from his mechanical engineering courses he was sent back to the village he came from. I do not know if he was expelled or asked to drop out but I do know my father never spoke of his time in university fondly. When he returned to the village he became a mechanic and that’s what he did for all of his life. Working on farm equipment and tundra vehicles instead of rockets and airplanes.

My mind snapped back to the question my brother asked. Did our father hate us? He had barely spoken to either of us since we returned in the spring. He did not act as if he hated us but, he definitely did not act the same as before my mother died. He had become introverted toward all of those who cared for him.  He only smiled when he listened to the radio. 

“No” I said, “He doesn’t, he loves us very much now go to bed.”

I heard my brother rustle in his bed.

“Okay” he replied as I heard him settle into the cot.

I sat there back in my peace when the gnawing thought came to me. 

 “What if he does?” 

While he had never been a doting father he was certainly involved in our lives, but as of recent it would be a good day if we heard him speak more than three words to us. He clothed and fed us, made sure we were set for our studies, and he of course let us play the radio, but besides that he was not involved with us at all. 

“What if he blames me?” 

My brother, as innocent as he was, had ignited a fear in me that would plague my mind for twilight nights on end and it would not grow quieter as the days progressed. 

A week after my brother had invaded my mind with that infectious question, my father returned to work and with that the times we saw him became fewer. I had now taken up the duties my mother had left: cleaning, cooking, serving, and managing my brother. I realized within a week what a vacuum my mother had left in our lives, I had already missed her terribly but now I longed for her. I longed for her to help me, to help me clean, cook without burning the food or myself, serve without spilling my work everywhere. To help me be patient with my brother. Most of all I wanted her help to figure out what my father was thinking. 

It was late one twilight, my father had come home and wordlessly ate dinner then packed some of the stew I had made for his lunch. He soon went to bed and sent us to our beds as well. I was sitting in my darkness when the thought came back, this time much more vicious. 

“He definitely hates me, I am nothing but a bother to him”

My heart sunk into my throat

“I should just leave this place”

I cried gently for fear of waking up my brother, would my father be better off without me?

It felt like the mountainous gaping hole my mother had left behind only grew each day, no matter how hard I tried to fill it in.

I could no longer stand my dark peace and quietly I went into the main room. Our house had the dining room, kitchen, living room, and office all in one open area. It was not very big but my father and mother had made it as cozy as possible. The tin roof never leaked and my mother had painted the inside to look more wood like, almost like a cabin.

I sat in the living room chair, even with the blinds shut the sun still shone bright through the cracks. The twilight in summer had never bothered me, but with everything going on my mind had made every bit of light look like a ghastly figure. Dancing. Dancing with some ethereal music no man alive can hear, made with the sounds of my suffering. 

As I sat there and watched this infernal scene, a mutter came from the radio. If the stillness of the night could jump and shake, that’s the emotion I felt. All my attention at once had gone to the radio on my father’s desk. 

I waited to hear the noise again without motion, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, an hour, it felt like eternity had passed when I finally heard it again. 

A single word, grotesquely butchered by the signal I could not understand it. 

My father during the night would never shut the radio down, instead he would change it to the lower unused frequency stations didn’t use. Every now and then there would be some interference and a buzz would come through, but never a word.

I slowly crept towards the radio, afraid that if 
I moved to much I would somehow change the signal. I inspected the radio and found it set to channel 65.1, definitely no where near the common stations would broadcast. I plugged in my fathers headphones and slowly turned the dial when-

“Wretched be man who prospers when eternity beckons him” 

What?

“How could you freely walk earth when he who shaped you into you cannot? He who rose the army and called to us has not forsaken you so why do you forsake him?”

A loud series of cries followed

“He who gave us our ability, who gave us our freedom and showed us life! We praise you!” 

I sat there awe stricken, horrified at what I was hearing. It was a man like a priest, speaking to what I could only assume was his congregation. Although I could understand what he was saying, my Russian was still not perfect so I had to listen close. 

“You who defied creations mandate! You who rescued us from conscience! We praise your name this night! This hour! This moment!” 

The cries turned into screams as he spoke this, deafeningly loud. I was adjusting the volume when they suddenly all went silent.

“You at home”

I froze. 

“Remember who we worship, do not forget your calling. Do not forget your seed you planted. For what you sow you will reap I promise.”

I relaxed and continued to listen. 

“Your God is my God, and my God is your God… we are his rock, we are his church. Annihilation will save us… Nema.”

With that, a loud chant began. 

 “Nema.” 

I said quietly, questioning if I was losing my mind when the radio suddenly went silent. I tried to turn the channel and search for the broadcast but no one was playing anything similar. I turned the dial back to where I had heard the sermon and it sounded like every other unused station, quiet static, no life to be found. 

I sat back in the chair, taking off the headphones and wondered about what I just heard when I looked at the clock.

My father would be awake any minute.

I scrambled to the kitchen and rushed some food together to act like I had been up making him an early breakfast. When he came out he sat down immediately at the radio and went to move the dials when he noticed the station. 

“66.6?” 

He said puzzled

He turned to look at me then back to the radio.

“Did you touch my radio?” 

He asked, emotion gone from his face.

I dropped the egg I was holding, what do I tell him? I don’t need to give him any more excuses to hate me but he would know if I lied.

“Yes but just to change the channel, there was some loud interference when I was just getting up, I didn’t even look at what I changed it too”

A half truth at best, a poor one at that.

“Hmmm.” 

My father said as he turned to the contraption on his desk, ending the conversation. I made him coffee and served breakfast to him at the dining room table. He continued to not speak as he ate and left shortly after he finished his meal. 

I got my brother up and prepared for the day ahead, with the chants of ‘Nema’ piercing my skull as I went throughout the day.

1nr1b52,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterPCreviews/comments/1nr1b52/reveal_why_the_best_touchscreen_laptop_microsoft/,Reveal Why the Best Touchscreen Laptop Microsoft Surface Impresses,"Testing out the Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 has been a day-to-day adventure. As someone who juggles work, gaming, and a fair share of binge-watching, I'm always in search of a device that can keep up without me needing to babysit it. This sleek little machine immediately stood out with its refined design and powerful configuration. It doesn’t scream for attention, but the moment you start using it, you know it’s built to perform. Right from the start, I noticed it balances performance and elegance like a pro ballerina. The question is — does it measure up to high expectations in all aspects? Let’s dig deeper.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**

This laptop is a visual treat! The platinum finish feels premium, and the overall design is minimalist without appearing boring. Weighing just 2.76 pounds, it's so lightweight that I carried it around all day without even noticing it was in my bag. Its dimensions (12.13 x 8.79 x 0.57 inches) make it ultra-slim, so negotiating crowded coffee shop tables or cramped airplane trays was a breeze. The aluminum body feels sturdy, without any flex, and it just screams “high-end.” Plus, there’s this satisfying click every time you open the hinge — it's oddly addictive.

Typing was another highlight. I’m a sucker for a good keyboard, and the backlit one on Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 2 doesn’t disappoint. The tactile feedback was perfect for my marathon writing sessions, and it didn’t even wake my partner up at 3 AM (score!). That said, the lack of multiple USB-C ports was a bit of a sour note for someone who relies on modern accessories. Still, the single USB 3.0, Mini DisplayPort, and Surface Connect made managing peripherals manageable.

**Winning Points**

- Super sleek and lightweight design that makes it incredibly portable.  
- Backlit keyboard perfect for nocturnal users.  
- Premium aluminum craftsmanship gives it a classy, sturdy appearance.  

[Check Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 price on Amazon.](https://ultimateprinter.com/p/b07w3x97jw/)

**Impressive Performance**

Under the hood, the Intel Core i7-8650U processor and a fabulous 16GB of DDR4 RAM deliver seamless multitasking. I tested it with multiple demanding applications open at once — browsing with 20 tabs, running Adobe Photoshop, and streaming Netflix in HD. Predictably, it crushed every task without breaking a sweat. The 512GB SSD ensures lightning-fast boot-up times and smooth app launches, so waiting around isn’t a thing anymore. Even games like Cities: Skylines and Sims 4 ran well, though, fair warning, don't expect beast-mode gaming with the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 630.

What really grabbed me was the Windows 10 Pro integration. The operating system's snappiness shines on this device, from virtual desktops to Cortana’s assistance. Those productivity features paired with the Surface Laptop 2 make it feel like the ultimate work-play combo.

**Rich Display and Touchscreen Interaction**

The 13.5-inch PixelSense touchscreen is vibrant and perfect for both work and play. With a resolution of 2256x1504 (201 PPI), text appears razor-sharp, and colors pop beautifully during Netflix marathons. The touchscreen is responsive enough to recognize even the lightest tap, making navigation surprisingly fluid. Whether flipping through PowerPoint slides or doodling in OneNote, it’s a joy to use.

I do wish the bezels were thinner to provide a cleaner, more expansive screen-to-body ratio. Other laptops in similar price brackets have moved toward edge-to-edge displays, which feels slightly more modern. But hey, I’m nitpicking.

**Long-Lasting Battery Life**

The battery life here is nothing short of incredible. Microsoft claims 14.5 hours, and although real-world usage (according to my unscientific ""Netflix-stream-till-dead test"") clocks closer to 12 hours, it’s still impressive. Forget the endless anxiety of ""Where's the charger?!"" during long commutes. Paired with its lightweight body, this laptop is a dream setup for those who spend loads of time away from desks.

**Areas of Concern**

- Limited ports: It lacks USB-C, which would’ve been helpful for modern connectivity.  
- Integrated graphics feel underwhelming for graphic design or gaming enthusiasts.  

**Product Comparisons**

Looking at its competitors, laptops like the Dell XPS 13 and MacBook Air crossed my mind while testing this one. Against the Dell XPS 13, the Surface Laptop 2 wins with a more comfortable keyboard — Dell’s felt flatter in comparison — and an easier-to-use touchscreen experience. However, Dell excels with better screen technology and thinner bezels. The MacBook Air offers similar weight and design aesthetics but doesn’t integrate quite as smoothly with productivity apps outside the Apple ecosystem. It’s safe to say the Surface Laptop 2 serves as an ""in-betweener"" — fitting somewhere between ultra-premium and practical.

**Value Proposition**

For what you're getting, it feels like a worthy investment. Premium build materials, impressive performance under the hood, and excellent portability reflect its price well. While certain features would elevate its game — like expanding its port diversity and upgrading the GPU — it’s a perfect option for productivity enthusiasts or casual users. It doesn’t come across as overpriced, considering its specs and sleek form factor.

As someone always on the hunt for the perfect balance between design, usability, and performance, testing out this programmable coffee maker truly felt like a daily indispensable companion in my kitchen. Being a coffee lover surrounded by equally caffeine-driven family members, I knew this device had a lot to live up to, especially with its promise of convenience and efficiency.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Aesthetically, this coffee maker hits that sweet spot between modern minimalism and functional design. Its ""Surf"" colored matte finish makes it an attractive addition to any countertop. Personally, I appreciated how compact the size is, given its ability to brew 12 cups. It's not bulky, measuring just 6.65 inches in depth, 10.35 inches in width, and 12.24 inches in height, which means it leaves plenty of space for other kitchen gadgets. An anti-drip spout on the carafe ensures no messy spills, something that kept my counters surprisingly cleaner compared to my older coffee machines.

**Performance and Programmability**  
The real game changer here is its 24-hour programmability. Trust me, nothing beats waking up and having fresh coffee ready to sip. Setting it up is straightforward. With its easy-to-read display and smooth buttons, programming became a hassle-free task even for my decidedly less tech-savvy partner. I set it to start brewing at 6:30 AM sharp on weekdays, and without fail, my morning coffee was always at a perfect temperature, even when I slept in till 7. After brewing, it keeps the coffee warm on its nonstick warming plate, staying on for an impressive 2 hours before auto-shutting off. That feature alone spells safety and energy-saving peace of mind.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
For someone who despises high-maintenance appliances, this one ticks the right boxes. Its reusable filter simplifies the process by eliminating the need for paper filters, saving me both money and effort while staying environmentally friendly. I won’t sugarcoat it, though—rinsing the filter after every use takes a bit of effort, but considering I’m avoiding disposable ones, it feels like a fair trade-off. The anti-drip carafe lets me pour myself a quick cup even while brewing is ongoing, saving time during those rushed mornings. Cleaning up afterward has been just as simple.

**Upsides**  
- Compact and decorative matte finish design enhances kitchen aesthetics  
- 24-hour programmability meets the needs of busy schedules  
- Auto shutoff adds an extra layer of safety  
- Nonstick warming plate keeps coffee hot and flavorful  
- Reusable filter cuts down waste and extra expenses  

**Shortcomings**  
- Removing and cleaning the filter, though easy, requires immediate attention after brewing  
- Light materials on the carafe give it a slightly less premium feel compared to pricier models  

**Challengers**  
After trying out several mid-range coffee makers, I can confidently say this one stands out. However, compared to other models like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which comes with single-serve versatility, or the Keurig K-Classic, which caters to pod enthusiasts, the BELLA 35203 leans more toward traditional drip brewing. Unlike the Cuisinart DCC-3200, known for extremely precise brew temperature control, this machine focuses more on simplicity and user-friendly operation. What wins me over is its reliable performance and reusable filter component, though those seeking pod compatibility might prefer alternative options.

**Quality for Price**  
If you’re all about value, this machine hardly disappoints. Its programmable features, combined with a decent-sized brewing capacity, make it worth every penny for households or individuals who want fuss-free functionality. While it doesn’t have some premium extras like adjustable temperature control or a flashy touchscreen interface, it skips unnecessary frills to keep costs reasonable without compromising on what truly matters. For the features packed into this coffee maker, it's undoubtedly a budget-friendly contender.

I'm a paying customer that pays for YT premium.  
For the last week or so, my videos have been buffering on desktop, and there have been consistent performance problems. Video buffering, thumbnails not loading, yet somehow preview videos work and content always seems to default to 144p even though I set it to only accept ""higher picture"" quality.

I ran a lot of speed tests, all other websites work perfectly fine and I can stream content no problem. I even bought a wifi extender because maybe my desktop was too far away from the wifi, but still it's giving performance problems.

I only use an adblocker, because I don't want to see any shorts content and there is no setting available to remove or disable shorts content, so I opted to just simply block it.

Even with my adblocker disabled, I still get the exact same issues. It also happens when I use my mobile hotspot. On my desktop I dualboot Windows and Linux, in both OS's with all browsers I get the exact same behaviour.

What I find odd is this does not occur on mobile devices.  
Now the problem has gotten so egregious that YT tells me that I'm disconnected, yet I'm using the exact same network, PC and browser to send this post to you.

It's been like this for a week. What is going on here? Please fix it, or I stop paying for premium.

UPDATE: As I was typing this the problem completely went away. I still want to know:

1. What happened and why are there performance dips over the last week or so?
2. Why can't I disable YT shorts permanently?
3. Why can't I force my video quality to be a specific resolution, why ""higher picture quality"" that doesn't work?

1nr15zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TagEvents1641/comments/1nr15zi/things_you_should_know_about_venue_pricing_in/,Things You Should Know About Venue Pricing in London,"If you’d like to make your budget go further for your next event, knowing how venues price their space is essential. Keep in mind that prices constantly change and that the locations, sizes, and extras such as catering/AV affect pricing. This is a shorter version of our blog post: [https://www.tagvenue.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-venue-pricing/](https://www.tagvenue.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-venue-pricing/), but hopefully it’s helpful to anyone who is new to venue booking in LDN.



* **Venue Hire Fee**

A venue hire fee is what you pay to rent the space. It usually just covers the venue itself, not extras like food or drinks. Some places might include stuff like a whiteboard, projector, or coffee, but always double-check what’s included before booking. Dry hire is when you only get the empty space (sometimes even without furniture or decor) and handle everything else yourself.

* **Minimum Spend**

Minimum spend is perfect if you’re on a budget. Instead of a hire fee, you agree to spend a certain amount on food or drinks. For example, a £1000 minimum spend for 100 guests means £10 per person. What’s included (drinks, food, or both) depends on the venue.

* **Wedding Package**

A wedding package covers the venue and basic wedding costs (ceremony and/or reception). It’s a time and money saver, priced per person or as a total. Packages vary. Some include extras like champagne, decorations, or a DJ. All-inclusive ones handle everything (catering, florist, band, photographer, etc.) and coordinate the day for you.

* **Daily Delegate Rate (DDR)**

A DDR is a budget-friendly option for conferences or meetings. It’s a fixed per-person price for the venue, coffee breaks, sometimes a meal, and basic equipment like a projector or flipchart. Half-day or full-day options make it easy to plan without surprise costs.

# Typical Pricing Types 

* **Meeting rooms' typical pricing types:** hire fee per hour, day delegate rate
* **Wedding venues' typical pricing types:** package per person, minimum spend, hire fee
* **Party venues' typical pricing types:** minimum spend, package per person, hire fee
* **Conference venues' typical pricing types:** hire fee, daily delegate rate



|Venue Type |Hire Fee|Price per Person|Minimum Spend|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Meeting Rooms**|£15 - £150 per hour|£40 - £90 per person|\-|
|**Wedding Venues**|£500 - £10,000+ per day|£45 - £200 per person|\-|
|**Party Venues**|£30 - £100 per hour|£40 - £100 per person|£200 - £2,000|
|**Conference Venues**|£50 - £850 per hours|£30 - £100 per person|£500 - £3,000|

Don’t get me wrong—the pitcher does what it promises, and it’s been quite handy. However, there are a few things worth pointing out that may help you decide if it’s the right choice for your home or not.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The moment I unboxed the pitcher, its ergonomic yet simple design caught my eye. The pitcher feels sturdy and well-made without being heavy. The handle is comfortable to grip, and even when it’s full, it doesn’t feel unwieldy. Thanks to the 10-cup capacity, it minimizes the need for constant refills, which is perfect in a household with more than one water enthusiast.  
The space-efficient design slides easily into my fridge door, without taking up much room. However, the plastic build, though BPA-free, does sometimes feel a bit basic. A small upgrade in materials could have helped make it even more premium.  

**SmartLight Filter Indicator**  
One of the standout features of this pitcher is the SmartLight indicator. It gives you a clear, color-coded display for the filter status. Green means good. Yellow hints at impending replacement time. Red screams, “Change me already!” Initially, I found this super convenient—it takes the guesswork out of knowing when the filter is no longer effective. However, I wish the light was brighter, as it can be hard to see in dim kitchen lighting.

[Check Brita OB46/OB06 Everyday Elite Water Filter Pitcher price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0b3gk9rw6/)

**Performance and Water Quality**  
I’ve got to give credit where it’s due—this thing filters water like a champ. Claiming to reduce 99% of lead and drastically lower contaminants like chlorine, cadmium, and asbestos, the pitcher lives up to these promises. Every sip of water tastes noticeably clean and refreshing, making it ideal for drinking directly or brewing that perfect morning coffee. My coworker, who’s super picky about water taste, even gave it an unprompted nod of approval.  
Something I found extremely helpful is that one Brita Elite filter can replace up to 900 single-use water bottles. Using the pitcher felt less like a tiny step towards sustainability and more like a leap.  

**Ease of Use**  
Filling up this pitcher couldn’t be easier. The flip-top lid lets you refill without removing the entire top portion, saving you critical seconds when you’re rushing in the kitchen (or just impatient like me). The flow rate through the filter isn’t painfully slow, either—it strikes a nice balance between functionality and speed.  
Still, I occasionally fumbled with the reservoir that holds the water before it filters. If you tilt the pitcher too early while water is still in there, you’re in for some splashy revelations. A minor flaw, but worth noting for clumsy folks like me.

**Key Benefits**  
- Reduces 99% of lead and other harmful contaminants.  
- Large 10-cup capacity minimizes the need for constant refills.  
- SmartLight indicator simplifies filter replacement reminders.  
- Space-saving design fits neatly in most fridge doors.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The SmartLight indicator isn’t very bright, making it tricky to read in low light.  
- Plastic build, although lightweight, feels somewhat basic.  
- Reservoir splash issue when tilted improperly.  

**Product Competitors**  
Looking at similar products, ZeroWater’s 10-cup pitcher and PUR’s Ultimate Water Filtration Pitcher seem to crop up as natural competitors. ZeroWater offers impressive filtration, removing up to 99.6% of all dissolved solids in water, but the downside is that its filters don’t last as long and tend to cost more in the long run. On the other hand, PUR provides a comparable experience but typically covers fewer contaminants than Brita.  
The Brita model does a stellar job balancing efficiency, capacity, and taste improvement, especially with its longer-lasting Elite filters that need replacement only twice a year. However, if high-performance filtration for hardcore contaminants is your top concern, ZeroWater might be worth considering.  

**Budget-Friendly Choice**  
Comparing it to other filtration solutions, the pitcher offers an excellent price-to-quality ratio. Its ability to replace up to 900 plastic water bottles per filter is a game-changer, saving both money and the environment. While it’s not the cheapest pitcher on the market, its efficient design, effective performance, and low maintenance costs make it a genuinely smart investment.

The main purposes were to see how flower rosin reacted to the ethanol wash and to see if the end product would work better in my homemade carts and disposables. If you have made cannabis carts before, you probably know that each substance works differently, and flower rosin can be the trickiest because of how plant matter and particulate fires in the atomizer, and in turn, clogs the cart. I dissolved x amount of 3 flower rosins in 200 proof ethanol, let them sit in the freezer overnight, then strained and filtered through coffee filters 3x. I proceeded to evaporate off the remaining ethanol on the stirrer hotplate, and finish in the purge chamber. It purged off the last little bits well at -29hg. I didn’t bother with the Buchner and vac pump setup for these experiments, but that would have sped up by the process. End weight was down by 16% which felt right, especially due to it being flower rosin. I will add, that I had already decarbed each flower rosin sample prior to adding to the ethanol. 
The end result worked much better when injecting into the cartridges and disposables. All of the liquid was tan to light amber, but not completely transparent. There was a noticeably diminished taste that I attributed to the decarb and that terpenes are water soluble and were trapped and separated during winterization. Finally, upon trying the carts, the high was very powerful and clean, and the cartridges all fired well. I used 1g/1ml cart tanks, but 0.5g would have worked better. Many carts can only handle flower rosin in 0.5g due to the viscosity and particulate in flower rosin. The flower rosin in the cartridges was slightly harsher than vaping it through the Banger rig or Puffco.",2,1758892627.0,CTsolvenless,0,1.0,False

1nr13ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/housekeeping/comments/1nr13ds/hotel_kitchen_rooms/,Hotel kitchen rooms.,"I’ve been housekeeping for almost a year and a half, worked at 3 different hotels. The first 2 were fine as far as the work, I felt valued and like I did a good job. Had very few complaints about my performance and was even promoted to head housekeeper after only 4 months at one of them. But this last hotel has been so stressful, mainly because they have rooms that have a full size kitchen and are basically like a mini apartment. 

The kitchen has a ton of dishes in it: plates & bowls, glasses & mugs, pots & pans, silverware & cutlery, cutting boards, coffee pot, toaster, Tupperware bowls, strainers, casserole dishes, juice pitchers, i mean everything. And they are expected to all be clean and spotless every checkout. We must remove all the dishes from the cupboards and inspect them all and wash them if there are any blemishes at all before doing the rest of the room, and replace any that are missing which is an extra trip to the top floor storage room. Then the managers come in and inspect them again and put them away. We also must scrub the oven inside if needed, the stovetop, and full size fridge and microwave. Then most of the rooms have 2 beds and a bathroom. We have to strip the rooms ourself most of the time too.

I tried telling the supervisor that 30 minutes is an absolutely unrealistic time to complete all of this. It takes 1 hour minimum and thats if the room is barely dirty. She agreed with me at that time as well as all the other housekeepers and one of them even got to the point of crying and had to take a personal day because the GM was yelling at her and criticizing her for not doing the kitchens fast enough. I offered advice to not overburden us by giving one housekeeper all the kitchen rooms while the others have none as it is an unfair division of work (they do this often: will give one housekeeper maybe 2 checkouts and another 8, which I also said is not fair but nothing was done). 

But then yesterday I was given 3 of those rooms on top of 5 other checkouts with double beds and a bunch of stays with double sheet changes. She sent another housekeeper on laundry duty to help me but only with beds because she was busy going back and forth with laundry duties. We also have no bin for our bedding so we have to walk back and forth down the hall each room to get bedding which cuts into your time dramatically and drains your energy fast. 

Once again I told the supervisor I have been given too much work to finish even with scattered help, but this time she would not hear it and tried to tell me Im just not working fast enough. She said you can make up the time from the kitchens by doing other rooms faster, but again I told her I couldn’t because I was given all the hard rooms and sheet changes instead of it being divided up fairly amongst everyone. 

My board time was 7 hours, which doesn’t include all the time Im spending prepping my cart and bins at the start & end of my shift, taking my laundry down each break and sorting it, walking/moving back and forth in the hall to get linens or do arrivals and whatnot in particular order (we also have to have checkouts done within 6 hours of our shift so she can check them). I said if the time for kitchens was accurate and you account for all this extra stuff I have to do, my real board time would be 9 hours. Plus 30 minutes for my breaks. Even with someone taking 10 minutes here and there to help me make some beds, it is still impossible. 

I told her and the GM they are expecting way too much from the housekeepers and I finally just quit and walked out. I couldn’t take any more of the gaslighting. 

Am I in the wrong here? How long would it take you to complete a room like this? My breakdown is: Each bed: 10 minutes with stripping & walk to get linens, Bathroom: 10 minutes with stripping & restocking, Kitchen: 10 minutes with no dishes to wash and appliances not needing scrubbed, Dusting, vacuuming, mopping & garbage: 5-10 minutes. That’s already 45-50 minutes without any extra mess and just a basic clean. And often times there is a mess because the guests are work crews that stay for weeks.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1nr12af,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1nr12af/explore_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Explore the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Nespresso VertuoPlus Worth It,"Brewing the perfect cup of coffee is an essential part of my daily routine. Whether it's a strong espresso shot to jumpstart my morning or a smooth, iced latte to enjoy during a break, the machine I use has to keep up with these demands. The Nespresso BNV420GRY1BUC1 has been one of the latest gadgets I’ve tested, and it earned quite the spot in my kitchen. This thoughtful machine promises single-serve coffee and espresso creations, and after days of putting it through its paces, there are some merits and a few hiccups worth sharing.

**Sleek and Compact Design**  
The very first thing that stood out about this coffee maker was its elegant, grey finish and compact profile. It doesn’t dominate my kitchen counter but instead adds a touch of sophistication with its chrome accents. Measuring at 6 inches deep, 17 inches wide, and 13 inches high, it was easy to tuck it in next to my coffee bean jars without losing counter space. The machine feels well-built, and at 10.14 pounds, it’s sturdy enough to avoid accidental tipping. Whether you're brewing for yourself or hosting a small gathering, its aesthetic appeal blends nicely with modern kitchen setups.

**User-Friendly Performance at the Touch of a Button**  
As someone who needs their caffeine quickly in the mornings, I did not have the patience for a 5-minute brewing ritual. Thankfully, this model heats up in just 20-25 seconds. One button controls everything, simplifying the brewing process without compromising taste. It’s fully automatic, and the Centrifusion technology ensures that each cup of coffee or espresso is brewed with an even flavor profile. Whether I opted for the 5 oz coffee setting or a double espresso shot, the process felt seamless.  

[Check Nespresso BNV420GRY1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b01n13vkqn/)  

**Versatility and Cup Options**  
Here's where this machine truly shines—there are four beverage sizes to select from at the push of a button. I tested all of them, switching between 5oz and 8oz coffee as well as single and double espresso shots. With the added versatility of brewing beverages over ice, it became my go-to machine not only for hot drinks but also for refreshing summer favorites. The included 40 oz water tank allowed me to make several drinks back-to-back without needing constant refills—a lifesaver for days with multiple caffeine cravings.

**Advantages**  
- Fully automatic operation simplifies morning routines.  
- Versatility with four brewing sizes for coffee and espresso.  
- Sleek, compact design fits into most kitchens with ease.  
- Rapid heat-up time of 20-25 seconds speeds up brewing.  

**Negatives**  
- Limited to Nespresso capsules, reducing flexibility with coffee types.  
- Automatic capsule ejection holds only 10 used pods, which can fill quickly if making several drinks daily.  

**Complimentary Welcome Set: A Tasty Introduction**  
Opening the box, I found a complementary set of Nespresso Vertuo capsules included—an unexpected but delightful surprise. These capsules made it incredibly convenient to test the machine straight out of the box, and they offered a variety of aromas and strengths. However, I noticed the capsule range can quickly become an expensive monthly habit if you’re indulging in multiple brews daily.

**Competing Brands**  
Experimenting with other coffee machines like Keurig and Illy’s espresso makers, I could see both similarities and distinctions. While Keurig offers a broader range of pod choices and sizes, it sometimes lacks the refined taste the Nespresso system delivers with its Centrifusion technology. Illy stands out for its high-end espresso quality but doesn’t have the same versatility when it comes to crafting iced coffee or larger brews. The BNV420GRY1BUC1 sits somewhere in between, striking a balance with its broad utility and premium taste.

**Value for Money**  
There’s no denying that this machine veers towards the higher end of the price spectrum compared to an average coffee maker, but does it justify its cost? After brewing everything from espressos to iced lattes, I could see its appeal. The convenience and consistent quality make it worthwhile for anyone who enjoys high-end coffee at home. While capsule costs can add up, the overall performance does make it feel like a worthwhile investment for coffee enthusiasts.

1nr11g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnCap101/comments/1nr11g5/whats_meaning_of_the_human_life/,what's meaning of the human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1758892447.0,AnCap101,0,0.25,False
1nr11ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1nr11ew/reveal_the_best_electric_espresso_maker_imusa/,Reveal the Best Electric Espresso Maker Imusa GAU-18234 Worth It,"**Durable and Stylish Design**  
The Imusa GAU-18234 espresso maker caught my eye thanks to its sleek and modern look. It brings a touch of sophistication to my kitchen with its black cast aluminum base and the brown-tinted Tritan top. Honestly, it’s not just pretty; it feels sturdy. The compact dimensions of 7.1""D x 4.72""W x 9.3""H make it a great fit even for small countertops. I’ve bumped it accidentally a few times during my morning caffeine crisis, but this little thing held its ground like a champ. Plus, the cool-touch handle not only has a stylish design but offers peace of mind when you're half-asleep trying to pour your espresso.  

**User-Friendly Features**  
I have to say, usability is where this espresso maker shines for someone like me who isn’t a morning person. The detachable base and the simple on/off button are lifesavers. Assembling everything is quick, and once you press the button, the espresso maker takes it from there without any complicated instructions. The visual brewing indicator is surprisingly handy; watching it brew gives me time to set my toast without burning it. Kudos to Imusa for making mornings less chaotic, at least in the coffee department.  

**Diverse Brewing Options**  
This espresso maker has turned my kitchen into a mini coffeehouse. I’ve experimented with traditional espresso, Cuban coffee, and even Moka. The aroma that fills the room is divine, and I found the flavor to be rich and authentic every single time. My sister, who visited last weekend, swore it tasted better than what she gets at her overpriced coffee chain. The adjustable serving sizes, allowing for either 6 or 3 small cups, cater perfectly to my family’s caffeine needs—or my solo coffee cravings during stressful workdays.  

[Check Imusa GAU-18234 price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0btr46tjm/)  

**Upsides**  
– Provides diverse brewing options to cater to different coffee preferences  
– Compact and stylish design that fits in most kitchens  
– Easy-to-use on/off switch with a detachable base for convenience  

**Flaws**  
– The carafe, although functional, feels slightly fragile compared to the sturdy body  
– No automatic shut-off feature, so I have to remember to turn it off manually  

**Multifunctional Usage**  
Beyond its coffee versatility, I’ve taken this espresso maker on camping trips—it’s compact enough to pack, and as long as there’s electric access, it delivers. For office settings, it has been my midday hero. Once, I even brewed some espresso during a family gathering, and let’s just say we hardly used the dessert table because everyone stayed glued to their coffee cups. Effortlessly transitioning from everyday coffee needs to entertaining guests makes it an invaluable addition to any coffee lover's collection.  

**Product Contenders**  
Compared to standout models like the Bialetti Moka Express, which I’ve used before, this electric espresso maker from Imusa offers more convenience with its automated functionality. Other competitors, such as the De’Longhi espresso machines, might feature more advanced programs, but they’re significantly bulkier—and let’s be honest, who has the counter space for those monsters? While some premium models focus on overloading features, the GAU-18234 sticks to essentials, and I appreciate that simplicity.  

**Value for Money**  
It delivers strong, flavorful coffee without a hefty price tag. Considering its range of features—reusable filter, easy assembly, compact size, and the ability to brew multiple coffee types—this espresso maker feels like a score in the budget-friendly category. Other machines in this range struggle to compete on all fronts without charging extra for bells and whistles. If you're like me and appreciate functionality without breaking the bank, this little black coffee warrior is worth every penny.

1nr116u,https://www.reddit.com/r/f150/comments/1nr116u/02_xlt_42_coolant_flush/,02 XLT 4.2 Coolant Flush,"Hey everyone, I acquired my Grandpa's old f150 since he recently passed and no one really wanted it. I love projects and the thought of getting his truck back to a good life was pretty awesome. 

Maintenance on this truck was not a priority so I've been doing all I can to catch up. Changed oil immediately, fuel & air filter, and my uncle did new plus and wires a few years back. It's been fun so far! 

So that leads to the cooling system. It was basically coffee, super dark, floaties. Just pretty nasty so I assume it was the coolant from 2002. I couldn't tell what color it was originally. I drained it and filled it with distilled water 5 times and it was still coming out pretty bad. I know they don't get the best rep but I bought a prestone flush kit and put it in and did that flush and it really pushed out everything and I got clean water flowing but could still see some trash floating. The oil looks great and there isn't any milkshake so I think it's just dirty.

I went to advance and got a new expansion tank cap and decided to get a bottle of the prestone super flush to run in it. Got home and put it in and drove it around for a bit and thought I'd let it sit overnight. I really wish I'd read the bottle because it said 6 hrs for a deep clean. I went home and flushed it out this morning so it sat for about 14 hrs. Do you think I messed up anything? It wasn't full strength because it said for 3+ gallon systems use 2 bottles and I think these have a 4.5 gallon capacity. I didn't see anything leaking but it was hard to tell since the flush kit is pretty messy.

I will be replacing all the tap water with distilled and prestone premium antifreeze since I know all the old coolant is gone

I find this gesture to be sincere and kind because I want his family to get to know our little girl. It warms my heart to see them making an effort to visit her. 

However, it dawned on me later today that not a single one of his family members ever offered anything to us… Maybe I’m different, but any time I’ve visited new parents, whether it’s friends or family, I always check in on the mama and ask her if she needs anything! Even if it’s something simple like grabbing her a coffee or tea, bringing over some snacks, buying a food delivery, baking her favorite dessert or completing a simple house chore so she can rest. Anything to help her feel taken care of since the newborn stage is ROUGH.

Am I completely selfish for feeling slightly upset that not a single member of my husband’s checked in on me? No one asked how I was doing or feeling, and nobody offered to bring anything over. Am I being weird or high maintenance? ",8,1758892393.0,Mommit,7,0.9,False
1nr106t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1nr106t/can_the_best_refrigerator_water_filter_frigidaire/,Can the best refrigerator water filter Frigidaire EPTWFU01 really deliver toxins-free water,"The Frigidaire EPTWFU01 PureSource Ultra II refrigerator water filter has been a real game-changer in my kitchen. As someone who values clean, great-tasting water, I decided to give this product a try after sifting through a myriad of water filter options. From the first sip of water, I could taste the difference—it was crisp, refreshing, and free of any unpleasant aftertaste. Knowing it’s backed by certifications from NSF, WQA, and IAPMO also gave me peace of mind that harmful contaminants were being effectively removed.

**Ease of Installation**

The push-and-twist installation of this filter is ridiculously simple. I was skeptical that something so vital for water purity could be this user-friendly, but I had it up and running in under five minutes. The instructions were clear: remove the old filter by twisting it counterclockwise, insert the new one while holding it horizontally, and then twist it 90 degrees clockwise until it clicks. The process was straightforward and required no fiddling or extra tools. It even fit perfectly into my refrigerator without hassle, which was a relief because I’ve had nightmares swapping filters in the past.

[Check Frigidaire EPTWFU01 price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b01bkwshhe/)

**Water Quality Improvements**

I noticed an immediate improvement in the water quality, and that’s no exaggeration. The carbon-based filter technology does an impressive job of removing chlorine taste, which used to make my water unpleasant at times. Beyond just taste, it’s designed to tackle significant contaminants like lead, nitrates, and mercury—exactly the kind of invisible threats that make tap water less than ideal. The cherry on top, quite literally, is that the water now keeps my coffee and tea tasting rich and full-bodied, as there are no impurities to interfere with the natural flavors. This filter genuinely makes me question why I ever considered bottled water in the first place.

**Advantages**

- The push-twist installation process saves time and effort.
- Removes up to 99% of contaminants, including mercury and lead.
- Certified by NSF and WQA for quality and safety.
- Improves the taste and odor of water dramatically.
- Compatible with a variety of refrigerator models.

**Key Design Attributes**

The filter’s compact design deserves a mention because it integrates seamlessly into my fridge. Measuring just 2x2x9 inches, it doesn’t take up any unnecessary space. Moreover, it weighs only 7.4 ounces, which made it so much easier to handle during installation. The white, minimalistic look blends well with my fridge interior, though I’ll admit the aesthetic isn’t a huge selling point for a filter. The packaging comes with Frigidaire’s Genuine Filters seal, which is their way of ensuring a premium, authentic product every time. That little detail made me trust I wasn’t buying a knockoff water filter.

**Good Points**

- Compact size doesn’t hog refrigerator space.
- Lightweight and easy to handle.
- Frigidaire assurance of authenticity through the packaging seal.

**Limitations**

With all its greatness, no product is without imperfections. Though this water filter came through in numerous ways, a couple of issues were mildly frustrating.  

- The “filter reminder light” on many refrigerators doesn’t turn off automatically after replacing the filter. I had to manually reset it by holding the water filter button for three seconds until it turned green again. It’s a minor inconvenience but might throw off someone less tech-savvy.  
- While the filter is robust and efficient, it feels pricey for a single unit. Investing in bottled water might initially seem cheaper, though the long-term cost-benefit leans in favor of the filter. 
- Another thing to note is the lack of additional components in the box—what you see is what you get, which is great for simplicity’s sake but offers no extra perks like reminders or cashback codes.

**Challenging Aspects**

- Manual reset for the fridge’s reminder light is slightly outdated.
- Perceived high cost for a single-use water filter.
- Limited box contents with no extras included.

**Competitive Options**

In the realm of refrigerator water filters, this product contends with other big names such as EveryDrop and Samsung DA29-00020B filters. The EveryDrop filter offers competitive water purification standards and is also NSF-certified, making it a close rival. That said, its installation is comparatively trickier, and compatibility with multiple fridge models isn’t as extensively broad as Frigidaire’s. On the other hand, Samsung filters focus heavily on multi-stage filtration but fall short in terms of user-friendliness and design compatibility. The Frigidaire EPTWFU01 balances ease of use, effectiveness, and adaptability better than its competition.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

When evaluating the value of this water filter, I can comfortably say it is a solid long-term investment, provided you’re willing to front the replacement cost periodically. Thinking about how many plastic bottles I’ve saved from ending up in a landfill adds another pro to the cost-efficiency argument. While the upfront expense might initially seem high, the savings pile up if you use the filter across its intended lifespan. Plus, there’s no comparing the convenience of having fresh, pure water on demand versus lugging home cases of bottled water.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nr0ygl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1nr0ygl/i_think_my_ex_is_a_covert_narcissist/,I think my ex is a covert narcissist,"This is just a rant. 

I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 3.5 years. I have been dealing with the breakup with a therapist who has helped me realise that she may have been a covert narcissist. While I was with her, it would have never crossed my mind to think this; I missed many red flags.

When we got together, I thought she was the absolutely best person in the world. She was so kind and caring, with a lovely bubbly personality that I loved so much. She had a lot of childhood trauma that she knew about from day one. Her mood was extremely volatile, and I spent a lot of time looking after her and listening to her, and discussing it. She moved in with me quite early on in our relationship and it felt perfect.

  
Later on in the relationship, we had some issues, and she eventually broke up with me. Only after this happened did I realise she wasn't exactly who I thought she was.

I had a bit of a mental breakdown after losing my job. I expected her to be there for me like I had been for her when her mental health had been poor. I was wrong, of course. She just acted like her struggle was more important than mine. If I was upset about something, she would just explain to me why i'm wrong. When I would open up to her after having a bad day, she would get all upset and make it all about her and how I'm the problem for oversharing.

The biggest issue we had was when we were packing to move out of our flat to a house we had purchased. When we were planning the packing, she told me and everyone around us that since she's moved so many times before (I haven't) she had it sorted and knew exactly how to organise everything, and it was all fine. However, when it came time to pack, she would just desert me every day and make excuses as to why she can't help out. I got really stressed as I was single-handedly packing all our stuff in boxes, chucking out unwanted stuff, and organising it all. I was incredibly stressed when I told her about it. She said, ""There is no reason to be stressed; it's only stressful if you make it stressful."" This, I now believe, was gaslighting. We were moving on a Monday, and we were attending a wedding on Saturday. She had planned to meet a friend on Sunday, which I asked her to move, but she refused. On Friday, it all got too much, I was physically exhausted and started crying, so I rang and asked her to come and help with packing. I was really upset by the way she had been acting, but when she came home, she went off on me for asking her to come and help, and now I was the problem, and she was really angry at me for it. After we moved, things just got worse. I was responsible for keeping the house clean, doing the DIY, sorting everything out and getting settled while doing all the washing, food shopping, cooking, and cleaning. She would never help out and would rather defer stuff to friends to do. We argued quite a bit, and she would never take accountability and just blamed me. She claimed I overstepped her boundaries. She claimed that since she had therapy every Friday morning, the whole rest of the day and night was about her, and asking her to do stuff on Fridays was not respecting her boundary. For me, this was just unworkable; the world doesn't stop for her on a Friday. 

Every Friday, she would go out and get really drunk and get back at 4am or as late as 6am. This meant the whole of Saturday in bed with a hangover, and I was left to pick up the pieces. I spoke to her about it and asked that we compromise on doing it every other Friday, which she agreed to, but nothing actually changed. She then just said, ""If you don't like it, don't come."" There was no awareness of how this affected the people around her. I have come to realise her words never matched her actions. She said things just to appease me with no intention of doing anything. She was incredibly lazy and did nothing around the house. It got to one point where I said to myself, ""I'm not dealing with this,"" and left it for her to do, but she never did until the day she moved out.

She expected a big song and dance on the rare occasion she did anything selfless. She made a big deal if I hadn't mentioned her makeup. In social situations, she would throw insults dressed as jokes and give backhanded compliments. 

She made everything my fault and wouldn't take any responsibility. I was told she was looking after me too much and that I was codependent, and that I needed to deal with it in therapy. I was so confused, as i was doing so much without any support while she was in bed or at her coffee shop drinking. It destroyed me on the inside. I have only just come to realise how manipulative this was. 

And now she is acting like this victim, and many of my friends have deserted me, and I am being left out of many social events.

I probably did a lot wrong; this was my first relationship, but I do wish I could have spotted the red flags earlier. 

My mental health is so much better than it was when I was with her. I have come a long way to believe I'm better off without her",4,1758892221.0,Manipulation,0,1.0,False

I've been making espresso at home for about 7 years now, and I can't tell you how many times I've seen people struggle with choosing the right coffee grinder. After going through three different grinders myself, I think I've finally figured out what really matters.

First things first - if you're serious about espresso, you absolutely need a burr grinder. Those blade grinders might be cheaper, but they'll give you inconsistent grounds that'll make your espresso taste like bitter disappointment. Trust me, I learned this the hard way.

So what should you look for in an espresso grinder? Here's what I've discovered:

1. Grind Size Consistency
This is probably the most important factor. Your grinder needs to produce uniform particles for even extraction. I recently found an amazing burr grinder that's been a game-changer for my morning routine - you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder

2. Stepless Adjustment
You want those micro-adjustments for dialing in your perfect shot. Stepped grinders just don't cut it for espresso.

3. Burr Quality
Ceramic or steel? Both work well, but ceramic tends to last longer. Steel burrs are typically sharper but might need replacing sooner.

4. Motor Speed
Lower RPM means less heat, which preserves those precious coffee oils. Around 400-500 RPM is ideal.

I've noticed that people often overlook the importance of retention (how much coffee gets stuck in the grinder). My current grinder (which you can find here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) has minimal retention, meaning less waste and fresher grounds.

Some practical tips from my experience:
- Clean your grinder weekly
- Season new burrs with cheap beans
- Keep your beans in an airtight container
- Adjust grind size when humidity changes

Budget is obviously a factor, but I've found that investing in a quality grinder actually saves money long-term. You'll waste less coffee, pull better shots, and the grinder will last longer.

Remember, even the most expensive espresso machine won't make up for a poor grinder. It's like putting regular gas in a Ferrari - you're just not going to get the performance you're paying for.

Let me know if you have any questions! I'm always happy to help fellow coffee nerds get the most out of their setup.

P.S. Don't forget to purge your grinder between different beans. Those old grounds can really mess with your flavor profile!",1,1758892087.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nr0vvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Codependency/comments/1nr0vvb/codependency_in_jobswork/,Codependency in jobs/work,"Why does no one talk about this aspect of codependency? I've honestly never been removed from a job by the employer (fired or laid off), I've only ever left jobs on my own. I've never been unemployed ever, even from the time I was a minor (and I've often had multiple jobs). 

I think part of this is because I've been very codependent with jobs, and it's led to severe burnout and depression at several points in my life. I would take all the shifts no one wanted, simply because bosses applied pressure (I often worked all weekends, holidays, overnight, etc.). At my high school jobs, they would even schedule me over days I for sure took off of work because they knew I would come in anyway if I was scheduled. They did this to me for prom once, and I worked my shift, changed into my prom dress in the bathroom, and caught the last half of prom. As an adult and parent, I would NEVER let my kid do that. WHY did I do that!? There was a period of 7 years where I never did anything for my birthday because it was a busy period at that job. I would also routinely cancel PTO to meet job demands, and often end up not using all my PTO.

I would also over-work constantly. I would come in early, stay late, and work at such a mad pace that I would often do multiple times the work of the average person. When I left my first job out of college, they hired two people to replace me. I would also stay at jobs much longer than I should have because I was worried they would struggle to replace me. 

I would end up taking on random responsibilities that weren't in my job description at all. At a prior job, it somehow became my job to order food for meetings, clean the office kitchens, run the dishwashers, put away dishes, and make the coffee. Because I did so much and took on a lot of extra, I ended up being severely underpaid for most of my career as well. They saw that I would just take things on, so I ended working multiple roles for no additional pay often. As you can imagine, my coworkers often didn't like me (I couldn't figure out why at the time, as I would cover their shifts and often do their work for them), and I was often bullied and ostracized at work on top of the over-work and under-pay.

Was anyone else like this too? It took me a long time to stop, and I mostly stopped because of burnout and mental health issues. I am no longer like this (thankfully), although I am still considered a ""high achiever"" at work. Healing this aspect of codependency is so hard, because especially in the US, these are considered ""positive traits"" at jobs.",3,1758892028.0,Codependency,3,1.0,False

* at first i made my assistant hold my phone… but it’s honestly awful. they can’t help with clients, they get bored, and the videos always end up shaky.
* then i tried propping my phone up on random stuff around the station (spray bottles, boxes, even a coffee cup). looked unprofessional and half the time my phone would slide mid-video.
* i bought 2 cheap amazon tripods thinking that was the fix. both broke within weeks.

meanwhile, my balayage + color work just never looked as good on video as it did in person. clients would say “it looks better in the chair than online” which is the opposite of what i want.

i caved and bought the [**Horizum** ](http://gethorizum.com)**OnTheGo Tripod** after seeing it pop up a bunch. ngl, i was skeptical, but it’s been the first piece of gear that actually makes sense for a salon.

* snaps on magnetically → i don’t waste time clipping my phone in/out.
* 360° rotation + 210° tilt → i can film the full before/after without moving the chair.
* solid metal build → not like the flimsy plastic amazon junk.
* compact → i move it between stations and it doesn’t get in the way.
* biggest win → my assistant actually gets to *assist* instead of standing there like a tripod.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1nr0qxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nr0qxe/the_dish_pile_that_broke_me/,The Dish Pile That Broke Me,"I swear, the dirty dish pile in our sink was starting to develop its own ecosystem. Every Monday, it felt like the week began not with a fresh start, but with a silent, crusty monument to procrastination. I'm Chloe, and I’m usually pretty chill, but honestly, this was getting to me. I found myself staring at a teetering tower of plates, mugs, and mystery bowls, wondering how Liam, Maya, and Noah could just… walk past it.

My internal monologue was like, ""Chloe, just wash them."" But then I'd remember it wasn't my turn on the chore wheel we'd ""definitely update this weekend."" Spoiler: we hadn't. Liam was always in his headphones, coding away, probably oblivious. Maya was highkey always running to her next client meeting, leaving a trail of half-eaten snacks in the fridge. Noah, bless his heart, would just quietly clean his own things and then retreat to his room, probably writing another thesis chapter. I tried a passive-aggressive note once – ""Friendly reminder about the sink!"" – but it just got buried under a stack of takeout menus. I was lowkey losing my mind. One morning, I literally couldn't find a clean coffee mug. That was it. That was the moment I realized something had to change, and it had to start with me.

I gathered everyone in the living room that evening, pretending it was for a ""house meeting to discuss summer plans."" Classic me, softening the blow. But once we were all there, I just… blurted it out. ""Okay, so, the sink. It's sending me. We gotta figure this out."" There was a moment of awkward silence. Liam took off his headphones, looking surprised. Maya actually put down her phone. Noah just nodded, looking relieved someone finally said it. We talked it out. No cap, it wasn't easy. Maya admitted she genuinely forgot and felt bad. Liam said he'd been so focused on a deadline he hadn't even noticed how bad it had gotten. Noah confessed he just didn't want to seem like he was nagging. We decided to ditch the paper chore wheel for a shared app – one that sent notifications. And more importantly, we agreed to just, like, talk when things were bothering us, instead of letting it fester. It sounds simple, right?

After that, things actually got way better. The sink stayed manageable, and our group chat became less about logistics and more about memes and planning spontaneous movie nights. We even started a weekly ""Family Dinner"" where someone new cooked. It felt less like three strangers sharing rent and more like, well, home. I realized that facing a little bit of awkwardness head-on made our shared space so much more livable. It was about respect, sure, but also about just being honest with the people you live with, even about something as mundane as dirty dishes. And honestly? We're all closer for it.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

Background

I’ve always had a tough relationship with my mom. We’re both strong-willed women (I’m enby but to my mom I am girl; so for this post, woman will do). She has repeatedly told me that I am “difficult”.

Mom first started to take me to CAMHS (UK child mental health service) when I was 8 years old in 2005. I was badly bullied in primary school for various reasons and it definitely affected the person I was/have become. I have very little recollection of being a child that age, but I doubt I would have been told the outcome of my first few appointments. However, my mom has maintained in the 20 years since then that I was first discharged from CAMHS because I was “too intelligent to be anything other than controlling and manipulative”... (at EIGHT years old - I seriously doubt an 8yo would know how to manipulate adults to the extent I’ve been subsequently made to feel guilty for). She and my dad would manage meltdowns/tantrums/upset from me with that in mind, that I was a manipulator.

At the age of 12, now in secondary school and still being bullied, I was referred to CAMHS again. I came out of those appointments diagnosed with depression and (at the time) “Atypical High Functioning Asperger’s” (now Autism/ASD). This development sent mom spiraling, and she has regularly over the years told me that she “grieved for months” and felt like she’d “given birth to an alien”. The way I was raised by my parents after my ASD diagnosis, was with the mindset that ‘the world will not change for her \[me\], she is \[I am\] the one who is wrong.’ Not a direct quote, but she has said stuff along these lines.

In the latter half of 2014, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder at 17yo. While driving home from the child psychiatrist who gave me this diagnosis, my mom sobbed and sobbed, and again she said she “mourned” for months. On the insistence of my mom and the psychiatrist, I was encouraged to go on an antipsychotic drug, which I was hesitant to do because of previous bad experiences with antidepressant drugs. I was 17yo, doing my A Levels - the medication really affected me and I slept through most of my lessons with my head on the desk in the classroom. However, I did well enough academically to get into a good university for my undergrad degree. I had a lot of meetings and appointments for years to try to get me and my family support, the majority of which my mom would join me in and help lead the conversations.

Throughout all of these diagnoses, mom was almost ever-present in the appointments. I don’t think this is necessarily unusual for children, but she often talked for me and this continued well into my 20s. This included GP appointments and psychiatric appointments, as well as having private discussion about me with my GPs, psychiatric professionals, and NHS therapists. I latterly stopped sharing information with my GP when the GP shared private information against my wishes with mom ‘for my safety’. 

Despite having tried a lot of medications since then that haven’t worked, I am still taking the same antipsychotic 11 years later - I have been on maximum dose for about 8 years.

I have, in late 2024, also been diagnosed with ADHD. I was initially put on meds for this too, but they did not remotely agree with me as I became incredibly paranoid. I came off them when unrelated physical health issues started.

At some point after being diagnosed with Bipolar, when I was over the age of 18, I was mentally unwell. Mom, along with my family GP, decided I was a risk to myself and that I needed extra care. Mom became my “advocate” at my GP, meaning that she was legally permitted to interact with the GP on my behalf. Mom then requested a similar role to interact with Student Finance England (SFE) on my behalf during my undergraduate degree. We had many arguments about these situations of responsibility, as I did not want her to have this much control, and don’t think that I needed it for so long or so constantly. Something I was unaware of until May 2025, was her role as my “appointee” with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP - they give work related benefits here). As my appointee, she was legally in charge of my benefits and all communication and funds went through her first. It meant that I was seen as a ‘vulnerable’ and ‘dependent’ person. 

In 2020, I had my mom removed as my advocate at our family GP surgery after a particularly nasty situation at home - we had argued to the point that police were called, and when they arrived my mom told them not to believe my side of things because I had “mental health problems”, leading to the police questioning my capacity to speak for myself. They very quickly realised I did have capacity, and I spent a few nights with friends. I also revoked her access to SFE for my postgraduate degree which caused more arguments.

During my undergraduate degree, while living with my parents and commuting by myself to university, my next-door neighbour took over a business and needed workers. My brother (younger) and I both worked for our neighbour. I ended up working for him for over six years as a manager. The job was cash in hand (non tax-paying) and long weekend hours. I hated it and regularly looked for alternative jobs. Mom dissuaded me from taking a different job, as, in her opinion, I had “committed” to working for him. However, with her encouragement, I also had several volunteer roles and this job alongside university, so sticking with my neighbour wasn't about time management. I wanted to quit several times, but each time I got close, mom strongly persuaded me that I shouldn’t quit. I moved on from this job when a friend encouraged me to apply for a funded postgraduate degree which changed my life.

My brother, however, was encouraged to get a tax-paying job (before me) with career-progression related to his undergraduate degree after graduating. He was supported in getting a credit card and ISAs with the potential of buying a home in the future - two things that my parents did not do with me. He still lives at home currently, although he did move out with his university degree for a year before realising he hated not living at home.

I currently rent and live with my partner (and our cat), and have done so since November 2023 after I started (and then successfully graduated from) my postgraduate degree. My mental health has been mostly stable since I moved out of my parents’ house, and there is a noticeable difference in the person I am without living with them. I pay for a private therapist fortnightly, who from day 1 did not think I was utterly mental as I had been led to believe growing up.

This year

In March, I tried to apply for Personal Independence Payment (PIP - a disability benefit in the UK), as I have been physically unwell since November 2024, and unable to work from March. I had previously tried applying for Job Seeker's Allowance (JSA - an unemployment benefit payment) in October 2024 (before I got ill), while looking for work after my postgrad degree. I had not heard back from the DWP (who deal with both JSA and PIP) following that application, but sort of forgot about it. I had not mentioned applying for JSA to any of my family members - however, mom mentioned in passing in December 2024 that she had received a letter from DWP sometime in the previous months, which had asked why her dependent (me) was applying for JSA, and whether she (mom) still needed to be my appointee. Mom said that she had written back to the DWP to inform them that she should be removed as my appointee.

Applying for PIP over a phone call in March also ran into a roadblock, as I didn’t have the correct information to get into my DWP account. I was told by the operator on the phone that I had an account from my previous PIP payments which had ceased around a year ago - one that I didn’t know I had. I had the obvious bits of information to access the account, personal data etc., but could not answer the other questions, such as: “What day of the week do you receive payment?”, “What was the date of your last payment?”. They said the answers would be in my bank statements, but I’d never received any payments. The only question I could answer was “you have an appointee, do you know who that might be?”, and I was able to give my mom’s details, assuming it would have been her. It was. I was sent a digital PIP application form to my email address. However, as I still couldn’t prove who I was to the DWP without that information, I decided to not complete the form.

Mom and I called each other a few times around this time, specifically about this topic. She said some concerning things that I would not have believed she’d said to me if my partner had not heard them too. Things, such as ‘you had PIP for years’, ‘I sent you some’ and even, ‘you received a back payment of \[over a grand\] at the end of last year’. This was entirely news to me. After this conversation, my partner and I started to record subsequent phone conversations with my mom. We kept recordings about DWP, PIP, and money.

She *had* sent me money over the years. However, I had always been told they were purely “gifts” - it was certainly never made clear that the money was actually mine. I even went to my bank at one point around this time, to see how references married up to the times she’d sent me these “gifts” - not one reference over the few years we could trace back from her mentioned PIP, DWP, or anything that sounded like it might have been that sort of thing, nor a single payment of any kind over large periods (including after the previously mentioned back-payment). Instead, the “gifts” were varied and random, didn’t happen when I was earning during my postgraduate degree, and often related to a specific item being bought.

Following this situation, in April, I submitted a request for my personal information from DWP to be released to me. The government website quotes a processing time of a month, however I never heard back for reasons I did not know at the time.

One Monday in mid-May, I received a call from DWP, which I thought was a follow-up of my information request. However, it was not! The person on the phone was chasing my PIP application form that I had not filled in. She was very helpful. Turns out, my mom was still my appointee, and as far as DWP could see, she had not informed them I’d moved out of her house in November 2023, or that I was no longer dependent on her. I had explained my situation to the best of my knowledge, mostly that I had *no knowledge of the situation* and had been kept in the dark regarding ever receiving PIP. I was informed that the PIP claim had started in September 2014 following my Bipolar diagnosis. The claim had ended in July 2024 (9 months *after* I moved out), up to which point I had been receiving the “maximum care and mobility” payment - the claim had ended in July 2024 because no one had responded to the DWP with information after they sent out an update request to my mom. Mom was also still registered as my appointee on their systems. I got emotional, and asked the lady on the phone what could be done about any of this. She spoke to her manager, who suggested removing mom from the account as my appointee. This was done solely because the claim had already ended and the situation was fairly unusual. They also gave me a longer time frame to apply for PIP.

That same Monday evening, my partner and I were due over at my parents’ house. We had made some notes on what I knew and what I wanted to ask. When we got there, I asked them both for a conversation - my parents’ heckles seemed raised immediately (this might have had to do with me having brought out notes). I told them a bit about the DWP call that I had had earlier that day. My mom immediately said how she had “told DWP I \[mom\] am no longer your appointee, they must have messed up” - though clearly the DWP had had no record of this. I responded “I know, and so do DWP, which is why you’re no longer my appointee”. I saw her jaw clench - she was not happy.

I queried how long she’d been receiving PIP payment. My mom was very suspicious of what I was saying and almost immediately said quite forcefully that I was “accusing” her of “stealing from” me. I told her I was doing no such thing - in fact, we had chosen my words VERY carefully so as not to do that. After this, she admitted having received the money from when I was 17yo. Apparently it went into her current-account of a bank she has since changed \[this part doesn’t make any sense to us (my partner and me), since she must have received the back-payment much more recently and was submitting annual forms/applications to renew the payments after that bank account would have been supposedly closed - that said, appointeeship rules seem to be that payments are made into a bank account belonging to the appointee, but not their main account to keep things separate\]. She said she didn't even realise it was coming in during the last few years.

She went very hard into the justifications for how the money had been used, and also about how difficult it has been living with me and my conditions. She reasoned that she was using the money as my ""family contribution"", especially as both my parents reduced themselves to part-time at work at certain points in time (on the recommendations of medical professionals) so that I could be cared for. This was all news to me, though again there is basis in the rules for appointees to use some of the funds to supplement lost earnings when reducing hours due to caring. The turning point in the discussion was when I asked what my brother's contribution was - we've both always been told that she'd never charge us rent or money as we're her children and she would provide for us (similarly, we were never given pocket money for the same reason). Obviously, this hasn't happened with me. She admitted that the money she got on my behalf was also being used on my brother, since the money was just going into communal family funds which my brother wasn’t expected to contribute to - but apparently I was contributing money without knowing it existed. She also said that when they spent money on me it came from my benefits, but that when spending money on my brother, it came from that communal pot (that they saw as their money but included my benefits that had been my ‘family contribution’). Her realising this seemed to be a big turning point in the conversation - she changed very suddenly from being defensive and said ""you're right, that isn't fair"". She immediately seemed a lot more understanding and apologetic. Her entire face changed and the colour went from her face a little.

She then asked if I wanted the money she had spent on my brother. The question caught me off-guard, as my partner and I hadn't thought that far ahead in the conversation, and had not expected her to offer. I said ""if you want to do that"". She suggested paying back a 5-figure amount which took me by surprise, although it was in line with the back-of-the-envelope figure my partner and I had estimated she might have had over the years. I also wasn't asking for it at all but didn't want an argument and felt unprepared. My dad tried to claim he was also my ""advocate"", but didn't seem to know chunks of what I was talking about. He said I was irresponsible with money as a child and that's part of why they didn't want to give me the money from the government as an adult. They asked where I thought the money had come from that I had been spending for years, and when I said “my job” they said that I had never had a job, that the money I was spending was my own through them. Mom said in a private conversation between me and her afterwards (same evening) that dad wasn't as involved as he claimed in that conversation (dad never is).

As far as I’m aware, the role of the appointee should be given up by the appointee when the dependent stops needing it. The role of an appointee is not to withhold financial independence from their dependent because they *think* that that person can be a bit frivolous with money. Mom said that she had tried to bring up the appointeeship in the years since it started, but that the conversations were never productive as she became apprehensive of the inevitable arguments where I would say that I didn’t want her to have control over my decision-making… so she kept the decision-making powers over me. To be clear, at the point of those discussions, I was not aware that that extended to benefits or that they even existed.

We left eventually and I had a tough night emotionally. The next day was challenging. I got a missed call from her first thing (about 9am) and then a text asking to speak. I did not want to talk. I called her back and made an excuse about why I'd missed it. She started the conversation asking what I had explicitly said to DWP as she was worried I might have misled them, mentioning that “I \[mom\] could lose my job”. I told her I was honest to DWP about not knowing what I was receiving.

She then said that she and dad were going to the bank to ""move some money around"" so she could send me some money. I checked my bank balance after a midday missed call. There was a very large increase. A 5-figure number, that was even more than she had suggested the night before. I was not prepared for this and cried. For their part, my partner said that it would have made more sense for mom to have sat down with me and for us to come to an agreed amount - doing it like this made me feel completely out of the loop and out of the decision once again, and also made me feel very controlled by the money even once she was giving me some of it.

Eventually after a third missed call in the afternoon, I called her back. She said the amount was ""about half"" of the 10-year benefits income. I've done the maths, it makes sense with inflation, but could feasibly even be less than half. She also said “now you can back me up with the DWP”.

I told her at about 4pm on the Tuesday that, ""I need processing time, I'll call you in a few days"". I received messages from her during that week that I responded to, just to be civil. Then on the Friday that same week, at 8.21am, she called me to wake me up because she believed I’d had enough processing time (calling every day to wake me up was previously very typical of her after I moved out - she would also regularly call me 10+ times every day). I was not happy, as she was yet again making the decision for me - this time, on how long I needed space from her.

The money she has sent me is currently in an ISA with my bank - I do not know what to do with it at all. I do not want to spend it without getting legal advice - it’s enough for a decent house deposit, not that I’m in a place to buy right now while not working. 

This month, September, I had finally gotten an appointment with a psychiatrist at my mental health clinic. I had been requesting an appointment with them since May; this was in order to talk to a mental health professional about both my physical health (which may be related to my mental health) and the situation with my mom. The psychiatrist I saw suggested that I may not have Bipolar Disorder, that my issues may instead have just been ADHD that had been misdiagnosed as Bipolar. So I am potentially being un-diagnosed with a condition I have been medicated for and controlled because of since I was 17yo. When I told my mom this, after she directly asked how the psychiatrist appointment went, she told me that she was “relieved for” me. This really hurt, since I feel that she majorly pushed for my diagnoses in the first place, and then financially benefitted from them (whether deliberately or not).

Since May, whenever she has wanted a positive interaction with me, she has been loving, caring, and kind. However, she has still lashed out, and she has been vicious. This includes having said “all these people you’re talking to \[friends that I’ve tried to talk to about this\], you’re betraying me - they don’t understand what it was like to wake up every morning and go to bed every night with how difficult you were” and “I \[mom\] can’t *live* without you as my daughter” - this isn’t the first time that she’s used hints of suicidal ideation in arguments. Every time I have brought up the upset and hurt I am feeling, all I get is excuses that I was “difficult”, that “you’re \[me\] not being fair, I \[mom\] am in limbo”.

\-

In the months since May, a lot of things have changed. I started making a conscious effort to detangle myself from my mom’s control.

* I finally changed GP surgery, despite having moved house to a different area of my city in 2023 - being at my family GP surgery was something I had actively been encouraged NOT to change by mom previously, despite me having brought it up several times.
* In this change, I had also changed my address on the NHS database, meaning that my medical letters would no longer be directed to my parents’ house as they had previously been, where they would often be read without my consent, despite asking her not to on multiple occasions.
* I have put myself on the electoral register in my area.
* My mom still pays my phone bill. For all these years I have not been able to access adult sites on data due to parental locks, despite being an adult for a decade. Having asked repeatedly to get the parental locks removed since I moved out in 2023, I was always given excuses as to why that could not occur. In August 2025, I asked mom explicitly for us to go to the shop for my phone provider so that we could transfer the bill to me so that I could pay my own bill and get parental locks removed. Within 2 hours, parental locks had been removed - when I had been asking for years… We went to the shop but my contract is up in late 2026 so she still pays the bill for now!
* My PIP application was rejected, with mostly 0s across the board (meaning I didn’t qualify for the benefits across various criteria). I don’t know whether I want to go to tribunal to challenge this. This is despite me having received the maximum payment less than two years ago when mom was submitting the paperwork on my behalf. I don’t understand how, in under 2yrs, I can go from maximum payment to nothing without mom having submitted misleading representations in the paperwork ‘on my behalf’ - which she has then pocketed. However, I should note that the UK’s disability benefits criteria have been tightened somewhat in that time.
* As I am still unable to work, I have looked into alternative benefits. I cannot receive any means tested benefits, for two reasons. 1) I have too much money in savings (a smaller amount was my savings from my postgraduate degree funding, but the majority was the money received from mom (but i don’t know whether i can do anything with it or whether it’s more sensible to leave it alone)), and 2) I have not contributed enough tax (see the job situation above where mom consistently dissuaded me from getting a tax-paying job into my mid-20s before I moved, as she always said she would “support” me).
* I am waiting for my medication to change after the psychiatrist review.

My family has barely left me alone in the subsequent months. My brother has asked me to meet for coffee a fair few times - something that is not normal for us. He is calmer with me than before, less critical and more accepting of me. My parents were trying to meet me at least once a week. They would buy me small gifts I wasn’t asking for, and would come round to my house if I said no to meeting them. I think they are trying to rebuild a relationship with me, but they haven’t really apologised or even acknowledged my hurt.

However, I have recently put my foot down after the psychiatric appointment and potential un-diagnosis. I have explicitly informed my family that I do not want to speak to them at all at the moment. I have muted all of them on WhatsApp and will not take their calls or messages. I have to say, I’ve felt emotionally lighter this week than I have for a long while.

If you’ve read this far, thank you!

TL;DR - I tried to apply for benefits and found out that I couldn’t access my account, though I had never applied before. Turns out mom had been claiming benefits on my behalf as my appointee, but had been seeing the money as my ‘family contribution’ without making me aware it even existed. When challenged on it, she sent me a large sum of money and insinuated that I should “back her up” if the authorities ever came asking, as she realised that she could get in serious legal trouble over the situation. She was heavily involved since I was 8yo with my diagnoses, and I feel that she pushed for me to be medicated. I am currently struggling with my family contacting me when I presently do not want a relationship with them after finding out about the benefits.",4,1758891668.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False

I first met Sarah at an art class I was attending for college. She was perfect, silky brunette curls, almond brown eyes, and perfect coco butter colored skin. She sat down next to me before the art class began when people were still flooding in. Immediately I was flustered by her beauty, butterflies beating up my insides.

“Hey” I said in a shaky voice. 

“Hey” she said back her voice like music to my ears

We talked about our love for art for a solid 10 minutes before the teacher spoke up.

“You are here to discover your inner self. When you draw your inner self reflects onto the paper. This class will teach you how to figure out your inner self and the meanings of your drawings” the art teacher said in a wise tone.

I cringed a little at this, I always found this kind of stuff a little corny.

I guess I didn’t hide my cringing face very well because Sarah looked at me and giggled a bit.

The art class went on and by the end I had built up enough courage to ask Sarah out on a coffee date. She said yes and we went on our date.

After our first couple of dates I asked her to be my girlfriend and she agreed. We had a pretty stable relationship until one night.

That fateful night Sarah came home from work a little irritated. I didn’t pick up on the signs and asked her to make me a sandwich in a joking tone. She didn’t laugh though. She exploded at me. Screaming about how hard her day was and about how I was a rude ungrateful man. Me, taken aback by the situation, I asked her what I did wrong. She did not like this at all. She stepped closer to me and screamed in my face. As she screamed her eyes started bulging out of their sockets. Her face twisting with anger as hair grew all over her face. Her mouth dropped farther than any human jaw would allow and her canines sharpened as they stretched longer and longer. Her eyes turned red with anger as hair grew all throughout her body. Her body morphed into one of a huge wolf. She was transforming into a werewolf right in front of my eyes. 

I screamed as I got up and ran to the bedroom where the shotgun was located. I slammed the bedroom door behind me and frantically ran over to my closet and pulled out a shotgun. When suddenly I heard the loud screech of claws against my bedroom door. The door burst open and I shot right into the werewolf’s face. It screeched in pain and I shot again right in the werewolf’s heart. The werewolf slumped over and morphed back into my girlfriend. I fell down to my knees crying. “Oh god, what did I do?” I cried out. I cried on my knees for a while before I realized I had to get away.

I drove away from my house, I drove for hours trying to clear my head and process what I had done. I didn’t sleep that night. The morning after I turned myself in. I explained the story how I’m explaining it to you and they put me in a hold at the psych ward until they could confirm I had killed her. I was sentenced to 15 years in prison but I got out 5 years early on good behavior and them figuring I was mentally ill. As I'm writing this I’m one year out of prison. I don’t know what I saw that night but I know it wasn't Sarah.

A Girl Has Gone Missin' in the Swamp.,"People think they know strange. Hell, before all this, I thought I did too. You see a lot of shit in the military, even more as a private eye. You think you know people. Well, you don't, trust me. There's a whole layer of filth underneath what you think you know. I thought I'd seen strange. Thought I knew weird. Thought I couldn't be shaken. I was wrong. Findin’ the book changed everythin’ for me. You know that sayin’? If you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back? Well it's true. More true than anythin’. All it takes is a glimpse beneath the veil. I wish I had never taken that last job, but it's too late now. I'm gettin’ ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginnin’.

I work in an old port town in the southern USA. The kind of place with rottin’ docks and always smells like rottin’ fish. The kind of place full of superstitious old-timers nd over the top stories. You won't find us on many current maps. This town hasn't been relevant in a long time. I get most of my work from the nearby city. No, I won't tell you which one. Hell, I won't even tell you the name of this town. Last thing I need is more weirdos comin’ here to go missin’ in the nearby swamps. For the sake of reference though let's call the place Portsmouth, nd you can call me James or Jimmy, local PI. Portsmouth is a rottin’ shell of what it was when I was a kid. Used to be a pretty nice place with lots of work. After the fishin' dried up, nd old mine shut down, it kinda just got forgotten about. Who knew that the mine runoff would send the fish runnin’? Who knew the mine would fall short after a decade of steady output? Not my old man. Not any of the other old-timers either, but that's life I suppose. Now the swamplands creep in on one side of us nd the salt water breaks the other.

So it all started bout two weeks ago. I'd just come down from my upper floor apartment down to my office. I was expectin’ a quiet mornin’ but as I walked to my door to unlock it, I saw a letter layin’ in front of it. I picked it up nd looked at the return address. Ellen Peterson from the city close by. Peterson… I didn't recognize the name. Tearin’ the letter open I looked at the contents. A picture fell out of the folded letter as I opened it up. I picked it up nd saw a young dark haired girl, with bright innocent lookin’ blue eyes nd freckles. I went back to the letter.

Dear Mr. Smith,

I write to you out of desperation. My daughter Mary, who came to Portsmouth to visit her grandfather, has gone missing. I've talked to the sheriff, and all I get is “We are working on it.” It's been three days. I know the time window for her to be alive grows smaller and smaller by the hour. Please accept my case. I'll pay whatever you want. You can start by talking to my father, Elias Bell. Thank you in advance. If you need anything please call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.

With all hope and sincerity, 

Ellen Peterson

Elias Bell… I knew the old man, nd I knew her too now. Ellen Bell ran off with some rich city boy after high school. I checked my watch. Pretty early. The old men would be at the local diner. I stuffed the letter nd photo in my pocket nd grabbed my coat. I stepped out into the cold, wet, fish smellin’ mornin’ air. Time to work.

I stepped into the diner nd shook off the mornin’ damp as I looked round. As usual the old-timers were all huddled up at the long table in the back. What wasn't usual was the hushed voices instead of the rowdy banter that usually accompanies em. A voice from the counter called out to me.

“Hey Jimmy, here for breakfast?” Said the plump woman behind the bar top.

I looked over nd gave her a small smile, “Not today Eileen. Workin. I'll take a coffee though.” She gave me a small nod nd waddled to the pot, fillin’ up a cup nd handin’ it to me. I took a sip nd headed over to the table. The hushed voices stopped as soon as I neared nd a gruff voice on the opposite side called out.

“Guess you're here to see me, eh boy?” Said a shriveled twig of a man in orange waders.

“Yea Elias, I’m here to see you. Ellen contacted me.” I said quietly lookin’ him in the eye. You had to be respectful with these old-timers. You didn't show respect nd pay your dues to the water nd they wouldn't give you the time of day.

Elias nodded slowly, “She said she would. That useless fuck sheriff hasn’t done a damn thing but sit on his fat ass in that comfy office. I don't know how a beached asshole like him got voted in in the first place.” Said Elias angrily, his fist slammin’ into the table as the other old men nodded at his words.

Sheriff Johnson was a fat old man who basically just filled his position in name only. Most the time if any real work needed to be done in this town it was me or Deputy Bellham doing it. The sheriff never set foot in a boat in his life, therefore he wasn't respected by a single person in this town. Though he might've earned some if he actually did his job. 

“Give me the details Elias. Tell me what happened to Mary.” I said, leanin’ on the end of the heavy wooden table.

Elias looked down into his coffee cup. The other old men just watchin’ him patiently as he seemed to gather his recollection. 

“She's been stayin’ with me bout three weeks. Honestly I was surprised she wanted to come out. Ain't nothin in this town for a girl her age. Maybe it's because I dote on her, or she just wanted to get away from her folks, I don't know."" 

He shook his head slowly for a moment before continuin', “Bout five days ago she said she made a friend. I asked her who, but she brushed me off. She was a good girl, so I didn't push the subject. Next day she went out again, came back nd there was a smell hangin’ on her. I knew it, we all do. That swamp smell. I asked her again, who was this friend? Again she tried to brush me off, but I pushed this time. Asked her if it was one of those swamp-dwellers. She hesitated nd that was confirmation enough for me. Maybe I got a bit stern with her. Told her she knows better. Shouldn't be hangin’ round those swamp folk.” 

He paused for a second nd a single tear rolled down his cragged cheek. “Guess she just wanted to placate me, cuz she said ok, nd she wouldn't see em again. I thought that was the end of it. Went out to sea the next mornin’. When I came back she was gone.” 

An old-timer next to him placed a weathered hand on his shoulder as Elias seemed to sink in on himself. I nodded slowly. Last thing I wanted to do was take a trip to the swamplands, but if that's where the trail led, then that's where I was goin’. 

“Alright Elias, I'll look into it, but you know, three days in the swamp.. You know what I'll probably find right?” I said grimly.

Elias looked me in the eye sternly. “You just bring her back boy. One way or the other nd you'll have our gratitude.” The old-timers all gruffed out their assents.

“Alright.” I said standin’ up, ""I'll contact you when I find somethin’.” With that I downed my coffee nd headed out, puttin’ my mug on the bar.

“Be careful out there Jimmy.” Said Eileen with a worried wrinkle in her brow.

I nodded to her as I walked past nd headed back out into the damp mornin’.

As I walked down the pothole covered road I thought about what to do next. I'd need to prepare. No way I was goin’ into the deep swamp unarmed nd I'd need a guide. There was only one person for that. I took a turn nd headed to the bar nearby. Probably the only place in this town open twenty-four seven.

I pushed open the heavy door nd was greeted by the smell of warm booze nd sawdust. Here nd there the local drunks snoozed or talked to themselves in their seats. The lumberjack of a bartender greeted me as I entered.

“Mornin' Jimmy, what can I get ya?” He said in his low cannon of a voice.

“Nothin’ today, Al. Workin'."" He nodded nd looked to the lean figure sittin’ at the bar. Henry looked like a cowboy tryin' to become an alligator. Wearin’ blue jeans with alligator boots, vest nd hat. He sat there sippin’ on his whiskey. He was a muscular, tanned man in a small lean kind of way. A large bowie knife was strapped to his hip like a promise.

I came over nd sat next to him. didn't say a word, didn't have to. In all likelihood he already knew why I was here. He side-eyed me for a moment nd downed the rest of his glass.

“When we leavin’ Jimmy?” He said in his smooth voice.

“Soon as you can get ready Henry.” I stared at him for a moment as he put his glass on the table nd pushed it away.

“Give me bout an hour nd I'll have the boat ready.” He stood up nd looked at me. “Dwellers been real strange lately, Jimmy. Strap heavy for this one. Not sure how they gunna’ react anymore.” I nodded thoughtfully as he stepped out.

Sighin', I got up off the stool nd headed out myself. I walked to my office stoppin’ momentarily to look out on the water. The dark blue water splashed against the decrepit docks. A few boats that have seen better days floated by the parts that were still usable. I remembered the days helpin’ my dad load the boat before goin’ out. Everythin’ seemed brighter back then. I wondered then if this town would survive my lifetime. I turned away nd stepped into my office.

I went through my apartment grabbin’ my gear. Camo boots, waders nd jacket. My .38 for the inside pocket. My .44 on the side of my hip. I debated on rifle or shotgun. In the end I went with the shotgun. I filled my pockets with ammo. When it came to the swamp nd the dwellers it was best to be prepared for anythin’. Was a time when the dwellers nd us got along alright. These days though they were almost completely isolated nd didn't appreciate visitors. If Henry said they were even stranger now.. Then I wasn't really sure what to expect anymore. I grabbed a backpack with some extra gear. Rope, tape, tarp, whatever might be useful if we got in trouble or had to bring back Mary in the worst case scenario. 

I stepped onto the docks, the weight of my gear remindin' me of my time in the army. Henry sat in his flat bottomed boat. Rifle slung over his shoulder nd pistol strapped to the hip where his knife wasn't. I tossed my bag in nd climbed inside. Henry lit a cigarette before startin’ up the motor. He took a drag nd started movin’ away from the dock. 

We headed up the coast. When we reached the channel that would lead us to the swamplands I looked up from inspectin’ my weapons.

“So how bad is it now, Henry?” I said watchin’ him expertly guide the boat.

Blowin’ out a puff of smoke, Henry looked back at me. “Pretty bad Jimmy. They're more paranoid than ever. More dangerous. Last month I came out to check my traps. Caught one comin’ up behind me, knife out. Fucker was covered in swamp mud, practically naked cept some cloth round his junk. Felt like I was seein’ tribesfolk in the Amazon or somethin’. Couldn’t understand a word the fuck said either before I made him silent.”

I looked at Henry for a long moment. There's an unspoken rule out here. What happens in the swamp stays in the swamp. It rarely happens but this town sometimes takes justice into its own hands. When they do.. They take it to the swamp. I decided I didn't wanna ask anymore questions nd went back to my inspections.

As we headed further inland the tree growth grew thicker, nd the canopy above blocked out the sun. Henry wove us between the trees nd kept us away from too shallow waters. We were movin’ slow. As I looked round I didn't really notice much of anythin’. Then I noticed that I really didn't notice anythin’. No movement. No birds makin’ noise overhead. No movement under the water's surface. Even the flies nd mosquitos were awol.

“Henry what the hell is goin’ on out here?” I asked in a whisper. I'm not sure why, but I had a feelin’ I needed to stay quiet. Had a feelin’ there were eyes on us. Henry just looked back at me. His expression was like stone as he turned back to guide us through. I readied my shotgun nd crouched into a stable position scannin' the area. I couldn't see anythin’, but I knew they were there. My instincts screamed danger as we moved ever deeper into the dark swamp.

Suddenly below us there was a boom. Before I could react the boat flipped up into the air, water splashin’ up round us before I was sinkin’ down in it. The filthy swamp swallowed me. Its foul taste fillin’ my mouth as I struggled to regain my senses. I flipped nd turned, losin’ all sense of direction. Blindly I swam where I thought the surface was, instead I met mud nd roots. Turnin’ I swam the opposite direction. I finally breached the surface inhalin’ the stale air, quickly lookin’ round for Henry. There was land nearby nd on the edge I saw him. Muddy hands dragged him from the water nd held him to the ground. I looked at the savage muddy faces. I couldn't believe these were the same dwellers. They had become absolutely feral, lookin’ like tribesfolk of some kind. As I looked, a figure stepped from the shadows, a woman bare chested nd covered in mud, wearin’ some kind of tribal headdress. 

She knelt down beside Henry as she pulled out the jagged, wicked lookin' dagger, nd he began to fight even harder against his captors. The woman raised the dagger high above her head shoutin’ in some language I'd never heard before, nd then, she looked at me. Bright green eyes looked at me. Too bright. Too green, or not quite green. Pain started to rip through my head as we stared into each other's eyes, but then she turned away, nd plunged the dagger down into Henry's heart. He gasped loudly as the blade struck home, his body twitchin before fallin’ still.

The dwellers stood then, all turnin’ towards me. Green eyes, but not quite green. Slowly they stepped back into the shadows, disappearin’ from view, but I knew they were still there, watchin’ me as I carefully made my way to the muddy earth where Henry lay. I struggled up the muddy banks to Henry's body, catchin’ my breath nd lookin’ down at him. He was gone. His eyes wide in terror nd slack jawed. Lookin’ round me, the shadows of the swamp seemed to deepen. My head felt tight, like somethin’ was pushin’ it from either side. Images of my time in the desert flashed in my head, but they were different, monochrome in color. Grey sands, black rocks nd dark sky, but there was a light somewhere, a greenish light. 

I shook my head nd reached for my weapons. The shotgun was gone nd so was the .38, but my .44 was still strapped to my hip. I pulled it out breathin’ slow, tryin' to calm myself. I scanned the area, but the light of the day was fadin’ fast nd the dark shadows lengthenin’. I took inventory of my ammo, eighteen bullets includin’ what was already loaded. I reached to Henry's side nd grabbed his knife. Then I moved.

The sun began to dip lower as I walked through the stinkin’ mud. I estimated my direction, tryin’ to move south towards the coast. The swamp grew darker nd darker as I stumbled forward. My flashlight was in my pack, lost somewhere in the swamps murky water. So I kept goin’, stayin’ quiet nd watchin’ my surroundin’s. Now nd then I’d see some movement, but it'd be gone as soon as I turned to look. My head seemed pounded harder the further I went. Eventually the sun vanished, plungin’ me into darkness. Through the canopy above I could see some stars, but I couldn't figure em out. Twinklin’ mockeries of our own constellations, but different enough that I couldn't figure out my directions. So I kept on, hopin’ I was movin’ straight, but knowin’ I probably wasn't. 

“James..” A whisper came from my right. I turned, holdin’ my gun forward in front of me. I couldn't see anythin’ but the shadows. They seemed to blur in my vision nd I quickly rubbed my eyes to try nd clear em.

“Come James..” Another from behind me. I spun, wavin’ my revolver side to side, scannin’ the area in front of me. Again nothin’ but blurred, twistin’ shadows.

I started to run. I moved awkward nd slow, the mud suckin’ at my boots with each step. The whispers came again all round me.

“James.. Come James.. Chosen James..” The cacophony of whisperin’ voices. My head pounded. My disorientation buildin’ nd buildin’ till finally I collapsed into the slick mud. 

Then there was light. Green flames lightin' up on torches all round me, held aloft by mud covered, green-eyed dwellers. I sat up raisin’ my gun once again. 

“Stay back!” I screamed as I waved my gun between the dozen or so individuals surroundin’ me. Then I noticed it. As I moved my weapon in front of me, two more torches lit up revealin’ a stone table covered in mold nd a rust colored substance. Round it were corpses, corpses mummified in a wet, sticky way that only a swamp can produce. Two of em were kneelin’ before the stone table, nd held aloft in their hands was a large leather bound book.

The figures of the dwellers stood in place round me. I stood up, gun still raised nd lookin’ at each of em. Then I felt a pull. Somethin’ in my mind tellin’ me to look forward again. I turned back, my eyes fallin’ on the strange book held up in those skeletal hands. Strange words were etched into the leather. 

Liber Smaragdi Luminis Aeterni

A shadow behind the altar seemed to shimmer nd a figure came forward. The woman from before, her green eyes lockin’ on my own as she approached the table. She raised her hands high up into the air.

“Electus Regis Smaragdi Venit! Gaudeamus in eius lapsu ad insaniam!” She yelled over us, her voice manic nd eyes fevered as she looked round.

I looked closer at her mud covered face as she looked at me from behind the altar. A wide grin spread across her face. Then recognition hit me.

“Mary? Mary, your mother sent me! I'm here to help you get home!” I yelled at her. 

She kept starin’ at me. “Domum sum… in lumine ipsius” She whispered at me.

Suddenly pain ripped through my skull nd I dropped to my knees, my vision blurrin'. I looked up to see hollow sockets nd wide toothy grins meet my gaze. An emerald light began to emanate from their dark eyes as skeletal hands grabbed nd held me down. I struggled with all my might as all round me the flames grew brighter as mud covered figures burst into eldritch flame.

I heard Mary's voice rise up, “Recipe nos, Rex Nativus ex Vacuao!” Another bright green flame grew from the direction of the table. Suddenly two green lights filled my vision. My eyes burned nd my head throbbed nd then, everythin’ went dark.

I opened my eyes to that monochrome landscape. Grey sand nd black rock with a toilin’ black sky high above me, but as before there was a light. A light like liquid emerald floatin’ nd reflectin’ off the monochrome surfaces round me. I turned in its direction to see a tall black misshapen tower of inconceivable geometry. At its top was the source of the light. A figure was there, behind its head a halo of that alien light. My mouth gaped open as I dropped to my knees. It was so close, yet so far away, nd to my horror I wanted to be closer. 

Shadowy tendrils slowly slipped down from the roilin’ sky round the figure. It reached a long clawed hand towards me as if beckonin’ me to take it. I reached out to it, nd suddenly I was there, kneelin’ before the loomin’ figure now only a few feet away from me. It turned its faceless head towards me nd reached down. Its large hand pressin’ to my chest. Pain flared from its touch burnin’ me nd forcin’ out a scream I didn't even realize I could emit from my body.

Its voice ripped through my skull, tearin’ my mind apart with each word. “Awaken child and see truth around you.” 

Then darkness took me once again.

I awoke a week later in a hospital bed. Sittin’ in a chair near me was Elias’s bony form. Images of hollow eyes nd skeletal grins flashed through my mind nd I yelped closin’ my eyes nd pressin’ my palms into em.

“Jimmy.. Boy what happened to you out there?” Elias said quietly. I kept my eyes shut.

“Don’t let anyone in the swamp Elias… nobody can go in there!” I practically screamed at him. 

He stepped back warily. “Yeah, okay boy. I'll tell everyone to stay out. Jimmy.. What happened to Mary? To Henry?” He asked hesitantly.

I opened my eyes then nd looked at Elias with a manic expression. “They’re gone Elias! Gone! There's nothin’ left!” I shouted loudly. Elias ran to the door best he could, yellin’ for a doctor to come.

I spent about a month in that hospital. I've forgotten things. I know I have. Everythin’ here is what I can remember. At least I think it is. Honestly I don't know what is completely real about this story anymore. What I do know is that I see things slippin’ into the shadows from the corners of my eye. I know that I have a certain instinct about things now. I know that when I got home the large leather-bound book was sittin’ on my bed. I know the handprint-like scar on my chest shimmers green in a certain light. I know that when I look in the mirror.. I see emerald eyes starin’ back at me.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

My Pcos has really flared up this past year, and to try and help ease symptoms I have cut out almost all ultra processed foods and added sugars with the occasional (<weekly) cookie or sweet treat. My day of eating is usually oatmeal, eggs, vegetables and meat at least twice a day. I do drink coffee with half and half and agave syrup every morning, baby steps lol. I do admit i could improve on the physical activity side as I have moved and have stopped hitting the gym in the past month but do brisk walking in my neighborhood multiple times a week, and my job keeps me relatively active. 

I had routine bloodwork done and my total cholesterol was at 209, and my ldl was at 145! Last year before I made these changes to my lifestyle my LDL was at 106, cant remember my total. Im trying to understand if i might be eating too much meat and eggs, or if higher cholesterol is a symptom of PCOS that comes along with flare ups regardless of diet. Before I changed my lifestyle I was eating very low protein high carb and mostly plant foods, with fast food twice a week, but I felt like dogshit. I finally have more energy now but that jump in LDL is concerning! Has anyone else gotten their lipid panel done and has received similar results? ",1,1758891390.0,PCOS,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

They were behaving normally and onky became week a day before they didd. I had them confined a couple of hours before Katie passed away and a day before Coffee died, both because of cardiac arrest.

What makes it worse is knowing that if I had been smarter with my choices or had been more attentive with how they behave, they might still be with me. I should had have them confined the first time the first time I had them checked at the vet a week before they died.

I really don't understand why it had to be them and why it had to happen so close to each other. My family had other cats that was also sick and in far worse condition that survived but why not them.

They were the sweetest and most well behaved cats I ever had and it pains me knowing that no matter how much I imagine what I could have done better and praying for things to go back the way they were, I'll never see them again in this lifetime. Everything seems pointless now. Every time I imagined a good future, both of them are with me and all of it is impossible now.

Goodbye Katie and Coffee. We were together for only 4 years but the impact you both made to my life is more than what I can express. I hope both of you know that I am thankful for the time we spent and there is nothing I would want more than to hug both of you again. I hope both of you know I'll give up anything to redo my choices for a chance to save you. I love both of you and I'll miss you forever.

1nr0iqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1nr0iqd/rapid_heart_beat_need_a_doctor_house/,Rapid heart beat - need a doctor House,"Hi Reddit doctors,

I'm dealing with **persistent heart rate issues** despite feeling much better mentally (suffered from anxiety) and having extensive tests. Seeking advice on what my next steps should be. Firstly, I am a male, 38, 187 cm (about 6""2), 88 kg (194 lbs), good shape, hitting gym, good musculature, non smoker, drinking occasionally (3-4 times per month of light drinking), no other medical issues other than a bit high cholesterol, perfect blood work, never used illegal substances.

# Background & Progress:

* **Quit Smoking & Coffee:** Successfully quit both, greatly reducing anxiety and eliminating panic attacks.
* **Medication:** Tapered off Zoloft (6 months use) a few months ago. Currently on **Propranolol (40mg AM, 40mg PM)** as prescribed by my doctor.
* **Mental State:** Feeling mentally stable, anxiety significantly reduced.

# Key Medical Results (All perfect/normal recently):

* **Cardiology:** Holter EKG, Ergometry Test, Heart Ultrasound all **perfect**. Blood pressure 105/75 (on Propranolol).
* **Gastroenterology:** Diagnosed with **Hiatal Hernia** & **Chronic Gastritis** (cardia closes poorly). *H. Pylori negative*. Taking **Pantoprazol**.
* **Blood Work:** Complete Blood Count all normal.

My Persistent Symptoms:

**Extreme Heart Rate Variability (HRV):**

* **Morning (lying):** ∼65−70 bpm.
* **Standing:** Jumps to ∼90−110 bpm.
* **Light Walking:** Jumps to ∼110−130 bpm quickly.
* **Evening (at rest):** HR rises to ∼88−100 bpm.

**The ""Legs Up"" Test:** HR at 100 bpm (lying) dropped to 73 bpm when legs raised. This pattern has persisted for years, not just since medication changes.

**Sensation When Starting to Walk:** My heart rate reacts unpredictably to walking, sometimes going from 70 to 100−130 bpm. I am talking about **LIGHT walking** here.

# My Suspicions & Frustration:

Given perfect heart tests, the chronic HR fluctuations, and the specific jump upon standing, I strongly suspect **Autonomic Nervous System dysfunction**, possibly **POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome)**. My current cardiologist doesn't seem knowledgeable about POTS, and I'm hesitant to rely on her to research it. The Hiatal Hernia's potential impact on the vagus nerve might also be involved.

It's frustrating; I've consulted numerous specialists, and while all my tests are clear, no one seems to know what to do about my persistent fast heart rate. I need an individualized approach.



# Seeking Advice On:



1. **What specialist should I seek next?** (e.g., Cardiologist specializing in autonomic dysfunction/Electrophysiologist, Neurologist, a better gastroenterologist focusing on the hiatal hernia/vagus nerve connection).
2. **Any immediate self-management tips for POTS-like symptoms?**
3. **Similar experiences or insights?**

    x %% 5        # modulo
    x // 2        # floor division

It’s based on CoffeeScript (compiles into JavaScript), and keeps most of its features: lazy variable declarations, everything is an expression, and implicit returns. The goal is a minimal, easy-to-read syntax. It mostly resembles Python.

Now I’m trying to name it. I like **Trivial** because:

* it makes certain math usage feel trivial
* it suggests the language is trivial to learn

But in computer science, a “trivial programming language” means something completely different. On the other hand, OpenAI uses its own spin on “open,” so maybe I could do the same?

1nr0g32,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1nr0g32/jousset_samples_review/,Jousset Samples Review,"I got some samples of Jousset perfumes and thought I would write a review in case anyone else is interested. I’m very new to the perfume world so I don’t know all the descriptors or comparisons yet, but hopefully this will still be somewhat useful. Also if anyone has any recommendations for me based on what I like here please let me know, I can almost guarantee I won’t have tried it!

Sticky popcorn - 9.5/10. This is very almost my platonic ideal of the perfect perfume. I used to love the original formula of the Lush Let The Good Times Roll body spray, but wished it was a bit more subtle as I didn’t like that anyone halfway down the street could smell me. This is exactly what I was after, a more elevated, subtle version. It opens with the perfect sweet, salty, buttery, caramely, warm popcorn smell and then on me it dries down into the most delicious creamy posh vanilla ice cream, the tub you only buy when you’re properly treating yourself. It sits very close to the skin, which is a bonus for me and meant I kept getting lovely wafts of it as I moved. The only thing that lost it a half a point is that the longevity is only about 4 hours on me, so would need to be reapplied during the day. Honestly if it had better longevity it might be the only scent I ever wear again. I haven’t tried spraying it on clothes though, so maybe that would help its staying power. I will definitely be saving up for a full bottle. 

Le gourmand - 8/10. This was both exactly what I was expecting and a bit of a surprise. It’s a very true chocolatey nutty smell, and when I saw those notes I expected it to be quite sweet, but I don’t think it particularly is. It opens with a cloud of Nutella and then settles down to be very similar, but without the sugar, almost as if Nutella was made of dark chocolate. This also sat fairly close to the skin but had slightly more sillage than sticky popcorn, and this was much longer lasting on me as I was still getting wafts of it 12 hours later. It’s lovely on its own, but if you wanted a slightly sweeter smell, I’m sure it would work well layered with escapade gourmande or any other sugary vanilla. I liked it a lot and might get a travel size. 

Banana split - 6/10. This opens with a powerful  artificial banana smell. It’s a terrible replica if you want to smell of actual bananas, but bang on if you want to smell of banana flavoured sweets. In any event, that fades in about 15 minutes and you’re left with a scent very similar to le gourmand, just a little bit sweeter, not as powerful and ever so slightly more generically fruity. It also sticks around for about 6-8 hours on my skin. The lasting scent is nice, but it’s also similar enough to le gourmand that there’s no reason to get both, and I prefer the other one. 

Accident a la vanille madeleine de proust 6/10. I really liked the opening of this one! It is a nice, sweet but not overly sweet, baked, biscuity vanilla. The peach and apricot notes come through very lightly, but they mostly just balance out the vanilla rather than being the stars of the show. It has a little bit of projection, but not a lot, and lasted about 6-8 hours on me. Unfortunately, after the initial spray, the scent settles to be just a bit too creamy for me personally and that initial biscuity-ness that I really liked goes quite quickly, so I don’t think I’ll be purchasing it. It’s a shame because the initial spray was lovely! 

La tarte tatin - 3/10. Oof! I can see this maybe working as a funky candle, but I don’t like it on my skin. It is strong, when I first received the samples the entire package smelled of this one. By far the strongest of the lot with massive projection and longevity. I think they went a bit wild on the autumnal spices and at points it straddles the line between apple pie and straight up curry. After a few hours of wear once it’s settles down there are occasional whiffs of something pleasant, but on the whole it’s a no. 

Crème brûlée - 1/10. Well this shot straight past crème brûlée and into cheesecake. Which doesn’t sound that bad but it is. I don’t want to smell like sweet cheese. I can’t comment on the longevity as I had to wash it off after 20 minutes. 

Café affogato -0/10. This rating is totally on me, not the perfume. I didn’t order a sample of this because I knew I would hate it but it was included as a freebee. I get car sick and when I was little my parents always drank strong coffee on long journeys, so now the smell of coffee makes me feel car sick, and if anything has a coffee note it it, that’s all I can smell. I’m sure it might be a perfectly lovely perfume, but I couldn’t even spray it on my skin, one spritz in the air was more than enough for me. ",2,1758890885.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

Body:
Hey folks 👋

Last summer I spent about a month backpacking solo in Kyrgyzstan — trekking Ala-Kul, doing a horse trek around Song-Kol Lake, and wandering through the Mars Canyon near Issyk-Kul. Thought I’d share a few lessons that stuck with me:

	1.	Say yes to trail companions.
At Ala-Kul base camp I bumped into two other hikers. We decided to climb the pass together the next morning. Sharing the altitude slog with them made the freezing climb way more fun (and safer).

	2.	Have a system for safety.
Connectivity is patchy. I always left a rough route with someone back home and carried offline maps. It felt boring at first, but it gave me the freedom to actually enjoy the treks without stressing.

	3.	Solo ≠ lonely.
On a 3-day horseback trip around Song-Kol, I had long stretches of silence. But the evenings spent with my guide’s family in their yurt, drinking kymyz and eating fresh bread, were some of the warmest moments of the trip.

	4.	The landscapes are epic, but people make it memorable.
I loved the wild colours of Mars Canyon, but the real highlight was swapping stories with other travellers while camping near Issyk-Kul.

	5.	Community matters.
Backpacking solo teaches you self-reliance, but I found myself craving more ways to connect with other travellers on the road — even just to grab a coffee or share a marshrutka.

Curious — for those who’ve backpacked in Central Asia (or anywhere), what’s the one lesson that stuck with you?

Honestly thought I’d cave in the first week, but tracking my streak kept me going. Now I feel more focused & I’m finally not glued to my phone waiting for a text!

Here's everything I did to move on:

**1. Track your no contact streak!!!!**  
Having Ick app show me my streak makes me not want to throw it away. Even when I wanted to break, seeing the number climb was motivation. It's like Duolingo streak but for no contact, and I just feel compelled to keep it up.

**2. Learn how to move on**  
Ick has little guides and reminders that explain *why* no contact works. It made me feel less crazy for missing someone who hurt me so. damn. much.

**3. Meditate when the urge hits**  
Every time I wanted to text, I’d open the meditation section. 5 minutes of breathing calmed me down way more than sending a “what are you up to?” ever could 😅

**4. Talk it out (even to AI)**  
Some nights I just needed to vent. Ick’s AI therapist actually helped me process my thoughts instead of spiraling. But if you got real friends, talk to them!

**5. Celebrate small wins**  
1 week, 2 weeks, 30 days. Every. milestone. matters. I started rewarding myself with little things like coffee runs, new book, etc.

1nr0a0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1nr0a0g/im_a_pi_for_a_local_port_town_a_girl_has_gone/,I'm a PI for a Local Port Town. A Girl Has Gone Missin' in the Swamp.,"People think they know strange. Hell, before all this, I thought I did too. You see a lot of shit in the military, even more as a private eye. You think you know people. Well, you don't, trust me. There's a whole layer of filth underneath what you think you know. I thought I'd seen strange. Thought I knew weird. Thought I couldn't be shaken. I was wrong. Findin’ the book changed everythin’ for me. You know that sayin’? If you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back? Well it's true. More true than anythin’. All it takes is a glimpse beneath the veil. I wish I had never taken that last job, but it's too late now. I'm gettin’ ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginnin’.

I work in an old port town in the southern USA. The kind of place with rottin’ docks and always smells like rottin’ fish. The kind of place full of superstitious old-timers nd over the top stories. You won't find us on many current maps. This town hasn't been relevant in a long time. I get most of my work from the nearby city. No, I won't tell you which one. Hell, I won't even tell you the name of this town. Last thing I need is more weirdos comin’ here to go missin’ in the nearby swamps. For the sake of reference though let's call the place Portsmouth, nd you can call me James or Jimmy, local PI. Portsmouth is a rottin’ shell of what it was when I was a kid. Used to be a pretty nice place with lots of work. After the fishin' dried up, nd old mine shut down, it kinda just got forgotten about. Who knew that the mine runoff would send the fish runnin’? Who knew the mine would fall short after a decade of steady output? Not my old man. Not any of the other old-timers either, but that's life I suppose. Now the swamplands creep in on one side of us nd the salt water breaks the other.

So it all started bout two weeks ago. I'd just come down from my upper floor apartment down to my office. I was expectin’ a quiet mornin’ but as I walked to my door to unlock it, I saw a letter layin’ in front of it. I picked it up nd looked at the return address. Ellen Peterson from the city close by. Peterson… I didn't recognize the name. Tearin’ the letter open I looked at the contents. A picture fell out of the folded letter as I opened it up. I picked it up nd saw a young dark haired girl, with bright innocent lookin’ blue eyes nd freckles. I went back to the letter.

Dear Mr. Smith,

I write to you out of desperation. My daughter Mary, who came to Portsmouth to visit her grandfather, has gone missing. I've talked to the sheriff, and all I get is “We are working on it.” It's been three days. I know the time window for her to be alive grows smaller and smaller by the hour. Please accept my case. I'll pay whatever you want. You can start by talking to my father, Elias Bell. Thank you in advance. If you need anything please call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.

With all hope and sincerity, 

Ellen Peterson

Elias Bell… I knew the old man, nd I knew her too now. Ellen Bell ran off with some rich city boy after high school. I checked my watch. Pretty early. The old men would be at the local diner. I stuffed the letter nd photo in my pocket nd grabbed my coat. I stepped out into the cold, wet, fish smellin’ mornin’ air. Time to work.

I stepped into the diner nd shook off the mornin’ damp as I looked round. As usual the old-timers were all huddled up at the long table in the back. What wasn't usual was the hushed voices instead of the rowdy banter that usually accompanies em. A voice from the counter called out to me.

“Hey Jimmy, here for breakfast?” Said the plump woman behind the bar top.

I looked over nd gave her a small smile, “Not today Eileen. Workin. I'll take a coffee though.” She gave me a small nod nd waddled to the pot, fillin’ up a cup nd handin’ it to me. I took a sip nd headed over to the table. The hushed voices stopped as soon as I neared nd a gruff voice on the opposite side called out.

“Guess you're here to see me, eh boy?” Said a shriveled twig of a man in orange waders.

“Yea Elias, I’m here to see you. Ellen contacted me.” I said quietly lookin’ him in the eye. You had to be respectful with these old-timers. You didn't show respect nd pay your dues to the water nd they wouldn't give you the time of day.

Elias nodded slowly, “She said she would. That useless fuck sheriff hasn’t done a damn thing but sit on his fat ass in that comfy office. I don't know how a beached asshole like him got voted in in the first place.” Said Elias angrily, his fist slammin’ into the table as the other old men nodded at his words.

Sheriff Johnson was a fat old man who basically just filled his position in name only. Most the time if any real work needed to be done in this town it was me or Deputy Bellham doing it. The sheriff never set foot in a boat in his life, therefore he wasn't respected by a single person in this town. Though he might've earned some if he actually did his job. 

“Give me the details Elias. Tell me what happened to Mary.” I said, leanin’ on the end of the heavy wooden table.

Elias looked down into his coffee cup. The other old men just watchin’ him patiently as he seemed to gather his recollection. 

“She's been stayin’ with me bout three weeks. Honestly I was surprised she wanted to come out. Ain't nothin in this town for a girl her age. Maybe it's because I dote on her, or she just wanted to get away from her folks, I don't know."" 

He shook his head slowly for a moment before continuin', “Bout five days ago she said she made a friend. I asked her who, but she brushed me off. She was a good girl, so I didn't push the subject. Next day she went out again, came back nd there was a smell hangin’ on her. I knew it, we all do. That swamp smell. I asked her again, who was this friend? Again she tried to brush me off, but I pushed this time. Asked her if it was one of those swamp-dwellers. She hesitated nd that was confirmation enough for me. Maybe I got a bit stern with her. Told her she knows better. Shouldn't be hangin’ round those swamp folk.” 

He paused for a second nd a single tear rolled down his cragged cheek. “Guess she just wanted to placate me, cuz she said ok, nd she wouldn't see em again. I thought that was the end of it. Went out to sea the next mornin’. When I came back she was gone.” 

An old-timer next to him placed a weathered hand on his shoulder as Elias seemed to sink in on himself. I nodded slowly. Last thing I wanted to do was take a trip to the swamplands, but if that's where the trail led, then that's where I was goin’. 

“Alright Elias, I'll look into it, but you know, three days in the swamp.. You know what I'll probably find right?” I said grimly.

Elias looked me in the eye sternly. “You just bring her back boy. One way or the other nd you'll have our gratitude.” The old-timers all gruffed out their assents.

“Alright.” I said standin’ up, ""I'll contact you when I find somethin’.” With that I downed my coffee nd headed out, puttin’ my mug on the bar.

“Be careful out there Jimmy.” Said Eileen with a worried wrinkle in her brow.

I nodded to her as I walked past nd headed back out into the damp mornin’.

As I walked down the pothole covered road I thought about what to do next. I'd need to prepare. No way I was goin’ into the deep swamp unarmed nd I'd need a guide. There was only one person for that. I took a turn nd headed to the bar nearby. Probably the only place in this town open twenty-four seven.

I pushed open the heavy door nd was greeted by the smell of warm booze nd sawdust. Here nd there the local drunks snoozed or talked to themselves in their seats. The lumberjack of a bartender greeted me as I entered.

“Mornin' Jimmy, what can I get ya?” He said in his low cannon of a voice.

“Nothin’ today, Al. Workin'."" He nodded nd looked to the lean figure sittin’ at the bar. Henry looked like a cowboy tryin' to become an alligator. Wearin’ blue jeans with alligator boots, vest nd hat. He sat there sippin’ on his whiskey. He was a muscular, tanned man in a small lean kind of way. A large bowie knife was strapped to his hip like a promise.

I came over nd sat next to him. didn't say a word, didn't have to. In all likelihood he already knew why I was here. He side-eyed me for a moment nd downed the rest of his glass.

“When we leavin’ Jimmy?” He said in his smooth voice.

“Soon as you can get ready Henry.” I stared at him for a moment as he put his glass on the table nd pushed it away.

“Give me bout an hour nd I'll have the boat ready.” He stood up nd looked at me. “Dwellers been real strange lately, Jimmy. Strap heavy for this one. Not sure how they gunna’ react anymore.” I nodded thoughtfully as he stepped out.

Sighin', I got up off the stool nd headed out myself. I walked to my office stoppin’ momentarily to look out on the water. The dark blue water splashed against the decrepit docks. A few boats that have seen better days floated by the parts that were still usable. I remembered the days helpin’ my dad load the boat before goin’ out. Everythin’ seemed brighter back then. I wondered then if this town would survive my lifetime. I turned away nd stepped into my office.

I went through my apartment grabbin’ my gear. Camo boots, waders nd jacket. My .38 for the inside pocket. My .44 on the side of my hip. I debated on rifle or shotgun. In the end I went with the shotgun. I filled my pockets with ammo. When it came to the swamp nd the dwellers it was best to be prepared for anythin’. Was a time when the dwellers nd us got along alright. These days though they were almost completely isolated nd didn't appreciate visitors. If Henry said they were even stranger now.. Then I wasn't really sure what to expect anymore. I grabbed a backpack with some extra gear. Rope, tape, tarp, whatever might be useful if we got in trouble or had to bring back Mary in the worst case scenario. 

I stepped onto the docks, the weight of my gear remindin' me of my time in the army. Henry sat in his flat bottomed boat. Rifle slung over his shoulder nd pistol strapped to the hip where his knife wasn't. I tossed my bag in nd climbed inside. Henry lit a cigarette before startin’ up the motor. He took a drag nd started movin’ away from the dock. 

We headed up the coast. When we reached the channel that would lead us to the swamplands I looked up from inspectin’ my weapons.

“So how bad is it now, Henry?” I said watchin’ him expertly guide the boat.

Blowin’ out a puff of smoke, Henry looked back at me. “Pretty bad Jimmy. They're more paranoid than ever. More dangerous. Last month I came out to check my traps. Caught one comin’ up behind me, knife out. Fucker was covered in swamp mud, practically naked cept some cloth round his junk. Felt like I was seein’ tribesfolk in the Amazon or somethin’. Couldn’t understand a word the fuck said either before I made him silent.”

I looked at Henry for a long moment. There's an unspoken rule out here. What happens in the swamp stays in the swamp. It rarely happens but this town sometimes takes justice into its own hands. When they do.. They take it to the swamp. I decided I didn't wanna ask anymore questions nd went back to my inspections.

As we headed further inland the tree growth grew thicker, nd the canopy above blocked out the sun. Henry wove us between the trees nd kept us away from too shallow waters. We were movin’ slow. As I looked round I didn't really notice much of anythin’. Then I noticed that I really didn't notice anythin’. No movement. No birds makin’ noise overhead. No movement under the water's surface. Even the flies nd mosquitos were awol.

“Henry what the hell is goin’ on out here?” I asked in a whisper. I'm not sure why, but I had a feelin’ I needed to stay quiet. Had a feelin’ there were eyes on us. Henry just looked back at me. His expression was like stone as he turned back to guide us through. I readied my shotgun nd crouched into a stable position scannin' the area. I couldn't see anythin’, but I knew they were there. My instincts screamed danger as we moved ever deeper into the dark swamp.

Suddenly below us there was a boom. Before I could react the boat flipped up into the air, water splashin’ up round us before I was sinkin’ down in it. The filthy swamp swallowed me. Its foul taste fillin’ my mouth as I struggled to regain my senses. I flipped nd turned, losin’ all sense of direction. Blindly I swam where I thought the surface was, instead I met mud nd roots. Turnin’ I swam the opposite direction. I finally breached the surface inhalin’ the stale air, quickly lookin’ round for Henry. There was land nearby nd on the edge I saw him. Muddy hands dragged him from the water nd held him to the ground. I looked at the savage muddy faces. I couldn't believe these were the same dwellers. They had become absolutely feral, lookin’ like tribesfolk of some kind. As I looked, a figure stepped from the shadows, a woman bare chested nd covered in mud, wearin’ some kind of tribal headdress. 

She knelt down beside Henry as she pulled out the jagged, wicked lookin' dagger, nd he began to fight even harder against his captors. The woman raised the dagger high above her head shoutin’ in some language I'd never heard before, nd then, she looked at me. Bright green eyes looked at me. Too bright. Too green, or not quite green. Pain started to rip through my head as we stared into each other's eyes, but then she turned away, nd plunged the dagger down into Henry's heart. He gasped loudly as the blade struck home, his body twitchin before fallin’ still.

The dwellers stood then, all turnin’ towards me. Green eyes, but not quite green. Slowly they stepped back into the shadows, disappearin’ from view, but I knew they were still there, watchin’ me as I carefully made my way to the muddy earth where Henry lay. I struggled up the muddy banks to Henry's body, catchin’ my breath nd lookin’ down at him. He was gone. His eyes wide in terror nd slack jawed. Lookin’ round me, the shadows of the swamp seemed to deepen. My head felt tight, like somethin’ was pushin’ it from either side. Images of my time in the desert flashed in my head, but they were different, monochrome in color. Grey sands, black rocks nd dark sky, but there was a light somewhere, a greenish light. 

I shook my head nd reached for my weapons. The shotgun was gone nd so was the .38, but my .44 was still strapped to my hip. I pulled it out breathin’ slow, tryin' to calm myself. I scanned the area, but the light of the day was fadin’ fast nd the dark shadows lengthenin’. I took inventory of my ammo, eighteen bullets includin’ what was already loaded. I reached to Henry's side nd grabbed his knife. Then I moved.

The sun began to dip lower as I walked through the stinkin’ mud. I estimated my direction, tryin’ to move south towards the coast. The swamp grew darker nd darker as I stumbled forward. My flashlight was in my pack, lost somewhere in the swamps murky water. So I kept goin’, stayin’ quiet nd watchin’ my surroundin’s. Now nd then I’d see some movement, but it'd be gone as soon as I turned to look. My head seemed pounded harder the further I went. Eventually the sun vanished, plungin’ me into darkness. Through the canopy above I could see some stars, but I couldn't figure em out. Twinklin’ mockeries of our own constellations, but different enough that I couldn't figure out my directions. So I kept on, hopin’ I was movin’ straight, but knowin’ I probably wasn't. 

“James..” A whisper came from my right. I turned, holdin’ my gun forward in front of me. I couldn't see anythin’ but the shadows. They seemed to blur in my vision nd I quickly rubbed my eyes to try nd clear em.

“Come James..” Another from behind me. I spun, wavin’ my revolver side to side, scannin’ the area in front of me. Again nothin’ but blurred, twistin’ shadows.

I started to run. I moved awkward nd slow, the mud suckin’ at my boots with each step. The whispers came again all round me.

“James.. Come James.. Chosen James..” The cacophony of whisperin’ voices. My head pounded. My disorientation buildin’ nd buildin’ till finally I collapsed into the slick mud. 

Then there was light. Green flames lightin' up on torches all round me, held aloft by mud covered, green-eyed dwellers. I sat up raisin’ my gun once again. 

“Stay back!” I screamed as I waved my gun between the dozen or so individuals surroundin’ me. Then I noticed it. As I moved my weapon in front of me, two more torches lit up revealin’ a stone table covered in mold nd a rust colored substance. Round it were corpses, corpses mummified in a wet, sticky way that only a swamp can produce. Two of em were kneelin’ before the stone table, nd held aloft in their hands was a large leather bound book.

The figures of the dwellers stood in place round me. I stood up, gun still raised nd lookin’ at each of em. Then I felt a pull. Somethin’ in my mind tellin’ me to look forward again. I turned back, my eyes fallin’ on the strange book held up in those skeletal hands. Strange words were etched into the leather. 

Liber Smaragdi Luminis Aeterni

A shadow behind the altar seemed to shimmer nd a figure came forward. The woman from before, her green eyes lockin’ on my own as she approached the table. She raised her hands high up into the air.

“Electus Regis Smaragdi Venit! Gaudeamus in eius lapsu ad insaniam!” She yelled over us, her voice manic nd eyes fevered as she looked round.

I looked closer at her mud covered face as she looked at me from behind the altar. A wide grin spread across her face. Then recognition hit me.

“Mary? Mary, your mother sent me! I'm here to help you get home!” I yelled at her. 

She kept starin’ at me. “Domum sum… in lumine ipsius” She whispered at me.

Suddenly pain ripped through my skull nd I dropped to my knees, my vision blurrin'. I looked up to see hollow sockets nd wide toothy grins meet my gaze. An emerald light began to emanate from their dark eyes as skeletal hands grabbed nd held me down. I struggled with all my might as all round me the flames grew brighter as mud covered figures burst into eldritch flame.

I heard Mary's voice rise up, “Recipe nos, Rex Nativus ex Vacuao!” Another bright green flame grew from the direction of the table. Suddenly two green lights filled my vision. My eyes burned nd my head throbbed nd then, everythin’ went dark.

I opened my eyes to that monochrome landscape. Grey sand nd black rock with a toilin’ black sky high above me, but as before there was a light. A light like liquid emerald floatin’ nd reflectin’ off the monochrome surfaces round me. I turned in its direction to see a tall black misshapen tower of inconceivable geometry. At its top was the source of the light. A figure was there, behind its head a halo of that alien light. My mouth gaped open as I dropped to my knees. It was so close, yet so far away, nd to my horror I wanted to be closer. 

Shadowy tendrils slowly slipped down from the roilin’ sky round the figure. It reached a long clawed hand towards me as if beckonin’ me to take it. I reached out to it, nd suddenly I was there, kneelin’ before the loomin’ figure now only a few feet away from me. It turned its faceless head towards me nd reached down. Its large hand pressin’ to my chest. Pain flared from its touch burnin’ me nd forcin’ out a scream I didn't even realize I could emit from my body.

Its voice ripped through my skull, tearin’ my mind apart with each word. “Awaken child and see truth around you.” 

Then darkness took me once again.

I awoke a week later in a hospital bed. Sittin’ in a chair near me was Elias’s bony form. Images of hollow eyes nd skeletal grins flashed through my mind nd I yelped closin’ my eyes nd pressin’ my palms into em.

“Jimmy.. Boy what happened to you out there?” Elias said quietly. I kept my eyes shut.

“Don’t let anyone in the swamp Elias… nobody can go in there!” I practically screamed at him. 

He stepped back warily. “Yeah, okay boy. I'll tell everyone to stay out. Jimmy.. What happened to Mary? To Henry?” He asked hesitantly.

I opened my eyes then nd looked at Elias with a manic expression. “They’re gone Elias! Gone! There's nothin’ left!” I shouted loudly. Elias ran to the door best he could, yellin’ for a doctor to come.

I spent about a month in that hospital. I've forgotten things. I know I have. Everythin’ here is what I can remember. At least I think it is. Honestly I don't know what is completely real about this story anymore. What I do know is that I see things slippin’ into the shadows from the corners of my eye. I know that I have a certain instinct about things now. I know that when I got home the large leather-bound book was sittin’ on my bed. I know the handprint-like scar on my chest shimmers green in a certain light. I know that when I look in the mirror.. I see emerald eyes starin’ back at me.

1nr09v4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nr09v4,Wolfsbane: keeps werewolves away by killing you first.,"This is an old Eli Lilly bottle of tincture of aconite—better known as monkshood or wolfsbane. In folklore it warded off witches and werewolves. In reality, it just killed people.

The Greeks claimed it sprouted from Cerberus’s drool. Romans laced enemy wells with it. Shakespeare gave it a cameo. It even shows up in Harry Potter. And physicians, with the optimism of their era, bottled it up as medicine.

Problem is, aconite doesn’t really *treat* much—unless you count “treats you to a sudden death.” Tingling lips, vomiting, heart failure… lights out. Antidotes? Mustard, tea, coffee, and a prayer.

So yes, it’ll keep the monsters away—mainly because you won’t live long enough to see them.

I was sort of wired after 5 months off of it at night, so last month I stopped taking vitamin d supplements as well.  My insomnia has now much improved since stopping both.  I went from sleeping 6 hours a night to 7 or 8 hours a night now. If I do experience insomnia, I sleep for 6 hours still.  I do sometimes wake up in the middle of the night still, but my sleep both before and after waking briefly is a deep sleep I have never experienced in my life prior to quitting.

My work has gotten better since quitting.  I have been able to work consistently all day without the feeling of having to wait for caffeine to kick in in order to be able to work.  I used to get bad migraines once a month that would only be fixed with ibuprofen and caffeine.  Those have stopped.  My headaches are minimal now.  If I do feel a lull in work, I go for a walk and feel energized after the walk.  I’m able to concentrate better and have read more books since quitting.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

You know how I was complaining that my morning coffee just tasted a bit thin and sad, no matter what beans I used? I felt like I was missing a piece of the puzzle. I was about to fall down the rabbit hole of expensive espresso machines, but then I remembered my French press sitting in the back of the cupboard.



It’s funny how we overlook the simple tools. I gave it a proper try, using a slightly coarser grind than for my drip machine and letting it steep for a full four minutes. The difference was honestly night and day. The coffee had a body and richness I didn't know I could get at home—it felt like a warm, textured hug in a mug.



The real game-changer for me was learning why it works so well. Unlike a paper filter that traps the coffee's natural oils, the metal mesh in a French press lets all those delicious oils pass right through into your cup. Those oils are where a huge amount of the flavor and that velvety mouthfeel come from. It’s not magic, it’s just science doing its beautiful thing.



So now, my morning ritual feels a little more intentional. It’s a few extra minutes of waiting, but it’s completely worth it. That little plunge has completely fixed my weak coffee problem without a single new gadget.

1nr08jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nr08jo/i_found_out_my_dad_is_cheating_on_my_mom_the/,I found out my dad is cheating on my mom the second time,"Not someone who just got divorce but I am the child of parents who'll be apart from each other sooner or later. 
One night, as usual, I was having some sleeping problems and my habbit is to scroll on the phone to get bored enough to fall asleep, but this phone is not really mine, ir used to be my dad's and I didn't bother to detele all the old data he have on that phone. So I was just scrolling thru his old pictures because of curiosity. And found some very odd looking pics of different women. 
At first, I told myself it's just some random pics he saved from facebook, nothing to worry about or just pics that he got asked to take for his female coworkers. But the more I look, the more I see the random lady keep showing up in his gallery in between 2020 and 2022.

I wanted to tell my mom about it, but I worried that she is not gonna believe me or say it's a long time ago, why bothered. Because last time he cheated on my mom before when I was 9 (that's 2015) and also the first to find out. She ended up forgiving him tho, I don't know why but she keep saying that he said he won't do it again, and he was just playing around. I was very pissed about it tho and I asked ""are you staying with him because you want me to have a dad or?"" She said it's nothing like that, just simply because she still love him, even tho she was hurt, she still choose to trust him once again...

Well as everyone guess, cheaters will always do it again if there is not huge consequences. But I still choose just to ask her if she know that women or not because maybe it's his old lover when from 2015 and he was trying to get back in 2020.
So I tried to be sneaky about it and ask my mom if she knew that lady, didn't mention anything about her other pics in my dad's phone tho, and she said she have no idea. That's when I got so shock because he have pics of he taking that strange lady out on a date, that's mean there was another woman.

3 days later, my sleep got even worse and I wanted to search up about people who have the same experience to see how did they handle the situation, using the phone that my dad gave me. It still had his google account on it and I decided to switch it to mine, when I was doing that I saw that his google drive is full so again, I got distracted and checked, and then I saw some very strange text messages screenshots.

He was calling someone nicknames that only people who is in relationship would call their partner and the person on the other side was really caring about his health to an obnoxiously intimate amount, he called them ""wifey"", ""pookie bear"" and one he even said ""I can't wait to see you again baby"". I am sure he is not talking to my mom but 4 different women, so yeah that was shocking to see from your dad, the guy who tell me that he loves his family more than himself. Cheated on my mom when my sister was only just 2 years old .

I had solid evidence of him cheating on my mom, after that day I ask her to go out a coffee shop with me so I can tell her all the crazy things I found out. Then I just pray so much for her to stop being stupid about the situation and leave him. He is really not a good dad or husband, she is working, taking care of their kids and doing 90% of the house chores too but everytime if she does make food for him at the right time, he will act like she is being lazy, he couldn't even take care of himself or her. He was never there for me, always say I am not being grateful of what he give me, say that I am not as strong or smart as him and I should be more like him. 

In general, the situation is effecting a lot me, even more than my mom, but I know soon I will move out and my mom will get away from him too. At first she doesn't believe she can find anyone better but I think there will be someone out there who love her and able to gain her trust again because she said she never trusted my dad 100% from the start since the day he work far away from home. I will try my best to support her finacially in the future but I still hope she'll able to find someone who won't betray her like my dad did.",2,1758890298.0,TrueOffMyChest,12,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I was hoping someone here might have advice on an issue I’ve been dealing with.

For the past few years, and more often over the last 6 months, I’ve had trouble falling asleep because my mind just won’t “shut up.” I’ll get into bed around 9:30–10pm, feel exhausted, but end up tossing and turning for hours. Sometimes I fall asleep only to wake up around 1am and lie awake until 4am. At times it feels like I’ve forgotten how to fall asleep.

I’ve noticed it happens most frequently on nights before going into the office, when I have to wake up around 6:30–7am. I go in 3–4 times a week, and I usually struggle with sleep just as often. I work a corporate job that can be long and very stimulating (not always in a bad way, I enjoy it), but I didn’t have these issues before I started this role about 4 years ago.

On weekends, I usually crash and fall asleep easily, maybe because I’ve been sleep-deprived during the week. It only happens rarely on weekends, usually if I need to wake up early or after a very stimulating day (like going out). The worst part is getting upset about not falling asleep, which then spirals and keeps me up even longer.

Things that sometimes help:

   - 5mg melatonin before bed (works most of the time, but not always)
   - Hot baths within 1.5 hours of bed — surprisingly effective

I’ve tried breathing exercises and cut off coffee after 12pm, but those haven’t made a big difference

I’d love to find a long-term solution, not just short-term fixes. Friends and colleagues suggest it’s stress/anxiety and that I should see a doctor or therapist.

Has anyone else experienced this? What actually helped you?

While nano isn't a great talker she's a great listener, listening carefully and trying to answer in the most efficient way possible. Or like in the morning when you wake up she would try to wake you up first normally but after some time she would just move the blanket away, forcing you to wake up. Or when it's like weekend and she clings onto you in the morning,try to not get out of bed because ""it's more efficient to be close to your partner"" and ""She can study later"" and stuff. Or how about how it would be to be on a date with her. Let's say you're going to a cafe,nano wouldn't bring a gift because she'd read that the men is the one that's supposed to bring the gift so now both of you won't have a gift. You go into the cafe,you both get your stuff (nano would obviously choose the most efficient menu ever). You sit down,one of you tries to start a conversation... Nothing happens but that's okay, it's fine if you two are just together with each other. Then nano suddenly hold your hand all of the sudden,the silence between you two made her nervous because this date isn't going as she's expecting,she seems... Sad,you comfort her and say that it's okay that not everything is going perfectly and she calms down again. Then you two finally got a conversation to work, it's nothing like spectacular but it's a peaceful,nice conversation. Suddenly nano asks you to feed her (don't ask me why) and you (of course) agree to it. While the date is going you could've sworn that nano was smiling once but sadly you can't prove it. Then the date ends,nano is blushing a bit because she had such a great time with you on that date,then she suddenly leans closer and gives you a short kiss,she doesn't say anything about it and just holds your hand and says ""We should go home, it's getting late"" and you two go home while you can hear a quite heartbeat on the way home. Or think about this, imagine studying with her,she suddenly asks you over to her room, she tells you about the test that's coming up soon and would like to study with you,you obviously agree because you're such a nice guy (let's be real,who wouldn't agree and do everything nano tells you to do). So you two sit down and start studying,nank is moving her pen quick and efficient, it's like she doesn't even need to read to study, it's like she just pulls all the answers out of her mind out of nowhere, it's like she's an...ai. You also notice how she secretly gives you tips while you learn vocabularys,she knows it's inefficient but she also hates to see you fail so she does it anyway. After a while nano is finished studying, she's stands up but instead of just doing something else she starts sitting on your lap,she had no reason to do it. She did just because she wanted to,just because she liked it. She just sits there, waiting, waiting until you're finished. After what feels to be an eternity you finally finished studying which felt like an eternity because of her sitting on your lap, making herself comfortable and making comments of how wrong you were and of how many mistakes you made. But it was all worth it after she gives you a reward for all the hard work: a kiss. Something about that kiss is... special, it's like she waited for this way to long for that kiss. Or how about a movie night with nano? Imagine this: It's like 4pm and nano suddenly comes to you and asks to watch a movie with her. Then she asks you to leave the living room while she prepares something in said room,after like 2 and a half hours she tells you to come in,she prepared literally EVERYTHING,the most efficient food,the most efficient blankets and pillows,the most efficient lighting,the most efficient movie ect...

Whenever I try to find resources to help me out of that hole that I am in, there's this one really ""great"" advise: meet with people that are important to you and talk to them. Be around people.
Well the only problem with that is... there is no one. I have no friends. I went no contact with my whole family because they're the reason for my suffering, don't take responsibility for what they did or still do and are all in all just toxic (not only in my opinion). Even if I had the strength to stay in contact, it wouldn't be a fulfilling and helpful experience. So it would probably do me no good anyway.
I am in a relationship but there is much conflict too so at times I feel that it is not enough or not the right place for some things. I'm triggered often inside the relationship, I push her away and hurt her when she only tries to help. It's a little much for one person, that's only natural I think. And where do I rant about problems within the relationship?
I have social anxiety so meeting new people is one thing, being anything near to being vulnerable with them a whole other dimension.

Whenever I read that advice, something inside me breaks. For years I thought I was just someone who needed no friends or people around them. For some time now there's a real longing for it and I realize that I do need peoeple in my life. It makes me angry, sad and disgusted with myself. I know it's well meant but reading it over and over again when there is no one to talk to and I'm at a point where it is too stressful to meet people, it's not really helpful advice. I just want to hide more and more, I feel more like an alien with every day. And all those guides that nonchalantly say: meet with friends, go out for a coffee with a family member. It makes me sick and only seems to perpetuate the downward spiral of feeling lonly. Realizing how lonly it really is and beating myself up for it.

I've been lurking on here since I got my tonsillectomy last Thursday (18/9) and it's been such a help. Both in tips and tricks but generally just the encouraging vibes I see from everyone. I'm on day 8 now and things are looking good so far! Still taking it chill but slowly getting more and more energy every day.

I made a ranking for the foods I've tried during the recovery, some of which I haven't seen recommended on here, so I thought I would share. Feel free to share your (maybe unconventional) food adventures as well (:

The ratings are obviously subjective, but maybe still helpful to someone! I'd say anything rated 7/10 and above is a strong recommend.

Popsicles: 10/10  
\- Obviously. We all know that this is the king. As important and amazing in the beginning of the healing as towards the end. Sometimes it felt like taking a step backwards to return to the popsicle, but it doesn't erase any progress that came before. It's just there to support you along the way.

Flat ice cubes that fit in your mouth: 10/10  
\- Night essential. Soothed any hint of coughing immediately. 

Caramel flan: 10/10  
\- Eggs, sugar, and creamy texture. What’s not to love.

Miso soup: 10/10  
\- First non-popsicle thing I managed to get down. No notes.

Pasta (boiled some extra minutes) in broth, with some cream (oat based): 10/10   
\- Tasty, felt like eating actual food. Took some courage but was worth it

Ravioli (boiled some extra minutes) with olive oil and parsley: 9/10  
\- First food I ate a whole plate of (day 4). 

Watermelon: 9/10  
\- Fresh, mixed, iced. Always perfect.

Udon noodles (also boiled until soft): 9/10  
\- Key player early on, one noodle at a time. 

Pistachio ice cream (day 3): 8/10  
\- Only dairy I managed to eat several spoons of. Maybe because I love it too much

White chocolate mousse and Coffee chocolate mousse: 8/10  
\- An unexpected saviour but a saviour none the less.

Sousjes (Dutch puffy pastries filled with whipped cream, frozen): 8/10  
\- Soft and cold. Not enough whipped cream to feel weird in the throat

Potato croquettes: 7/10  
\- Insane craving for this. Delicious, but a bit sad without sauce.

Soggy cereal (in oat milk): 7/10  
\- Tasty, but definitely a sad meal.

Plums: 6/10  
\- So tasty, but sadly a bit too sour. The skins felt weird in the throat. Necessary for digestion.

Banana: 6/10  
\- Weirdly difficult to eat, but filling and easy to puree

Pancakes: 5/10  
\- Thought this would be the perfect food but it got stuck in my throat quite a lot.

Cheesecake: 5/10  
\- Could only eat half, the biscuits at the bottom were a no-no.

Avocado toast: 4/10  
\- Avoid anything with grains. Plain white toast might have upped the score but I’ve avoided bread since. Avocado tasted kind of bitter.

Lentil stew: 2/10  
\- Lentils were very hard to eat ): but oh so tasty and filling

Red smoothie: 1/10  
\- Slightly better. Painful and not really worth it.

Green smoothie: 0/10  
\- Too acidic. Immediate no.

Coconut water: 0/10  
\- Had high hopes but to me this just tasted bitter.

Stracchiatella ice cream (day 1): 0/10  
\- Instant regret eating dairy so early. Avoided it after.

Mango protein shake: 0/10  
\- Secretly dairy, regret.

1nqzwrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/comments/1nqzwrh/semaglutide/,Semaglutide,"Just a little backstory, I've been suffering from anhedonia since the first time I took a SSRI (8 years ago). I've never been the same even when officially quitting them 4 years ago. since then I kept trying to find the source and try to fix it with no avail.

  
Until last May, I started injecting semaglutide to help with my weight loss. 4 weeks in, I stopped drinking coffee, stopped alchool, stopped gaming, stopped mindless scrolling (tiktok, surfing reddit). I actually felt like my brain was quiet and at peace. I found a new passion, which is reading. While reading romance stories, I've noticed myself actually ""feeling"" what the characters were feeling, their happiness, their longing.

A week after I noticed this, I started having goosebumps when listening to my favorite music, and even began singing the songs. I started feeling ""happy"". I felt like smiling for no reason and with it came a warth feeling inside me.

When taking a shower, I actually felt the cozy feeling of having warm water flows on my skin, and the goosebumps, I could trigger them just by thinking, which is a thing that never occured to me since anhedonia crept in. hugging myself felt good. My libido came back with a vengence, I no longer felt numb down there. I became hyper social and people noticed it. My whole personality changed and I felt like I was cured. I was once like this pre-antidepressant (8-10 years ago). I thought I found my old self back and couldn't be happier.

  
It lasted 1 month. Then the weightloss stalled from semaglutide. And I had to get a higher dosage to prevent my body from adjusting to the drug. But financially I couldn't afford it and I had to stay on a dosage that kept me stable. But my anhedonia came back.. and a couple weeks after I had to quit since it cost too much money.

Why has semaglutide temporary ""cured"" my anhedonia.. ? Nothing else changed in my life, my hormones are in check, vitamins pannels are all good. Anyone know if I can pinpoint my physical root problem to help me cure this ? based on the fact that glp-1 temporary fixed me ?

We then tell each other a joke, even as basic as a knock-knock joke, to start the day in a good mood. It may sound basic or cringe, but this is our sacred routine. It grounds us. Brings us together. 

This morning, after usual laughs we got into a discussion of naming our future child. It was a brief discussion, because we ended up on the name Bagel. It’s warm, round, and pairs beautifully with everything, literally. We could even spell it Beighal, so it looks more like a regular name, but honestly it's good by itself already. 

After my husband went to work that day, my cousin called me. When I excitedly told him about our decision, he didn't hide the fact that he found it very absurd. ""I don't want my nephew to be called what I order at the deli"", he said. Regardless, it is truly perfect to us. We could lovingly tell him/her, ""You're like everything, Bagel."" as a pun that writes itself. We would never have to resort to another joke ever again.

Apologies, this is a long one. 
So I (25f) met my friend (let’s call her Jenna, 24f) at the end of primary school, and we were very close all through high school and university, even though she moved to another city about 3 hours away. 

Now here’s the thing, Jenna has always had a problem with stretching the truth. Just close enough to the truth to make you either doubt yourself or believe that she must have more information. Making up conflicts between people, exaggerating what and how people have said things, and driving a wedge between friends to position herself as a centre piece of knowledge and innocent of all the ‘drama’. 

It’s also important to note that she has always been very sick, anorexia through high school, endometriosis, had two heart attacks before 24, depressions, anxiety - the works. Looking back, I think we always let her get away with too much but any time we confronted her about her behaviour she would have a meltdown, play the victim and then gaslight us, and no one wanted to send her off the edge. 
I was content letting the friendship fade a little when she moved away so we only caught up a couple of times a year. I had joined a new group of friends at uni, that she also met them when she would come visit. Only after about a year did the people in this group let their masks slip, and it had definitely given me some trust issues. They had initially come across as great and welcoming people (only because one of them wanted to sleep with me and later tried to SA me), very no = yes, stalking is a romantic gesture and I even reported one to the police for suspected grooming of a minor. I could go on more, but overall terrible people. While these behaviours were coming to light, Jenna started dating one of the guys (let’s call him Ryan, 25m) - Que 2 months of long distance crying, increased visits and general misery. Jenna and Ryan broke up, and Jenna immediately started dating one of the other guys in the group (let’s call him Chris, 25m) - like I’m talking next day type switch which was very messy as Ryan and Chris are also on the same soccer team. 

Jenna’s stretching of the truth has gotten significantly worse over the last 3 years or so, with bigger and more dramatic mood swings, to the point I’m worried she might be bipolar. 
A massive breaking point in our relationship as a trip organised by the Uni friends to go away for a weekend. I said no, as I was phasing these toxic people out of my life, but didn’t want the drama of confronting them. I had raised my issues with them directly previously, and they said they would just wait for me to leave social gatherings so they ‘could be themselves’. If that was who they really were, I wanted none of it. Jenna called me asking if I was going on the trip. I said no. She begged me to come, because she was going and didn’t feel safe with the group. I told her not to go but she had already paid. So I went on this trip with her and Chris driving. They dropped me off at the accomodation with the group, announced they had booked separate accomodation and LEFT ME THERE! With the people she didn’t (and I didn’t!) feel safe with. The next day, they were basically uncontactable, didn’t tell me where they were staying, and only picked me up an hour and a half after checkout time with no explanation and she couldn’t understand why I was angry. She even contacted everyone in the group to pay her back the portion of the accomodation she initially covered, which I said no. 

I didn’t talk to her for about 6 months after that, and cut out the last of that toxic group out of my life. 
Jenna then reached out to organise a girls trip to the coast with a couple of people from high school. I didn’t really want to see Jenna, but wanted to catch up people I hadn’t seen for a couple of years, so I agreed to go. It all seemed to be going fine, and I was enjoying catching up with our good mutual friend (let’s call her Marie, 24f). We grabbed groceries and cooked dinner while Jenna made brownies, and things were good. While eating and laughing over dinner I grabbed a brownie and said how good it was. Well. You would have thought I had come up with the worst insult I could have possibly said. Jenna went into a meltdown, screaming in my face that I was a  liar and had pretended to like the pasta at dinner (wtf?). I look bewildered that the other people at the table (they were equally taken aback). Eventually she calmed down but I couldn’t sleep that night, just replaying that in my head and getting angrier. The next morning when I woke up, Jenna and Marie were gone. Not answering calls or texts, but the car was still there. When they eventually came back, I confronted Jenna saying that what she said had upset me, and once again she started screaming, getting all up in my face, saying that I had always looked down on her and then stormed out. I’m not going to lie, I kinda dissociated watching a grown ass woman throwing a tantrum. I was shaking and looked at my other friends (trying their best to be invisible in the room) and asked if I was wrong, and if I was that I would go out and apologise. They said no, and we stayed and talked. Jenna came back about 15 minutes later, obviously annoyed no one came out to comfort her after her tantrum. 

After the trip, Marie and I spent 1.5 hours debriefing the lies we were told and systematically dismantling them - things like telling Marie that I was trying to manipulate her into getting back together with my brother (they dated for 2 months 6 years ago), that I was lying about being straight even claiming she saw me set up my hinge profile as bi (I wish! I know so many great women), and then a plethora of little white lies designed to tear apart our friendship, and make her look better. 

About 2 months after the coast trip, I got a message from her that she and Marie will be in my city and should grab coffee. I text Marie to catch up separately, and Marie let me know Jenna was trying to convince Marie to set up coffee with me and allow Jenna to ‘confront’ me. Marie obviously didn’t do that as she’s not an awful person. 

A couple of weeks later, I got a notification - I was invited to Jenna’s birthday! 24 hours before it started, in another city. I checked and the event was created over a month ago. I politely texted her that I couldn’t go but I hope she had fun. I rechecked the event and I was uninvited. 
About a month ago (a couple months after her birthday) Jenna text that she would be in my city and asked if I would like to catch up for coffee. I said no. She then text that I should visit her in her city, I didn’t respond. Then she asked if I was mad at her, I didn’t respond. The answer is obviously yes, but I just can’t see a world that she doesn’t twist everything I say and play the victim, and honestly? Is she doesn’t understand how she might have made me upset, I don’t think explaining it would make a difference. 
Couple days later, Jenna text ‘I guess that means yes’. 
The next day, I got a text from a random number and all it says is ‘F*#% You’. Now, the timing of this seems way too coincidental, I have her phone number but it might be Chris’ or another friend. 

I decided it was time to be petty. I sent them a link to Lilly Allen’s F*%# You. No response. Every day since I have been trolling this number with songs titled FU, funny t-shirt ads saying it and tik toks where all they say is FU. No response yet, but I cackle a little bit every time I send a new song imagining her on the other side fuming she can’t admit it’s her. Or maybe it’s actually a random person?

I don’t know for certain the number is her, but it still feel cathartic. 

So, am I an AH for ghosting Jenna, and trolling a random number?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

These days, your smartphone can do much more than just help you scroll through social media or send messages, it can actually put a little **extra cash in your pocket** while keeping you entertained. Some apps turn the idea of **making money** into a fun game rather than a chore. 

# Givvy Videos

The fun part is that you can just relax, laugh at a few videos, and see your balance grow at the same time. It’s like turning your guilty pleasure of endlessly scrolling into something that actually pays.

**Hich App** takes a slightly different approach and is perfect for those who enjoy a variety of casual games and interactive content. Instead of being tied to a single activity, you can try out new games, test your reflexes, and even share content with friends, all while collecting rewards. The playful side of Hich App is that you never really know what kind of challenge you’ll find next—one day it might be a puzzle, another day a mini-game that tests your memory or speed. It feels more like hopping from one fun distraction to the next, with the added bonus of a little cash incentive.

The app is built around quick interactions, like answering simple questions, checking out new content, or completing tiny challenges. What makes it funny is that it feels almost like a casual pastime—something you can do while waiting for the bus or sipping coffee. Instead of being stuck in dull, repetitive surveys, Hey Cash spices things up with varied activities that keep things fresh and amusing.
