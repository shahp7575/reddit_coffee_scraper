1jwogqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jwogqv/eilidh_saved_my_life_but_shes_been_dead_for_a_year/,Eilidh saved my life. But she's been dead for a year.,"Frozen by fear, all I could do was brace myself and listen. 



The longer I listened, the more certain I became that it wasn't a horn.



It sounded like a million voices, humming in perfect unison. Low and steady. Vibrating through the ground, through my body.



The tent rattled violently as another gust slammed into it—and then my worst fear became a reality. 



A guy line snapped. I flinched.



Another one followed, a harsh twang lost in the wind.



I couldn’t ignore it. I had to get outside. Had to fix it before the tent collapsed completely.



With trembling hands, I grabbed my coat, shoved on my boots, and crawled out into the storm.



The rain hit like needles. Wind roared around me, threatening to tear me from the mountainside. Lightning split the sky above the ridge—and for a moment, I saw movement behind the tent. 



Something other than wind. Other than rain. 



I turned. 



The symbols. They were wrong. 



Not just clearer, not just brighter—wrong. 



Rewritten.



Lines that used to fade into the stone were now jagged and sharp. Fresh. 



They twisted in ways I couldn't follow—as if spelling something out. As if they were watching back. 



Another flash of lightning—this time closer. 



The hum grew louder.



Whatever this was—it wasn't just a weather system. 



The guy lines were beyond saving, and I needed to get away from the tent. It was no longer a sanctuary—just a flapping sheet of fabric waiting to entangle or suffocate me. 



I left everything inside. Took only what I had on me—my bag, my jacket and my boots—and started moving back down the ridge. 



This was dangerous but not as dangerous as staying here. 



If I wanted to survive this, I had to keep moving. 



I moved as slowly and carefully as I could, my boots slipping on the rocks regardless. 



I kept my mind locked on the path—on each step—but the humming grew louder with every footfall.



Then, without warning, the hum had exploded into an ear-splitting yowl, and the wind that had only threatened to throw me from the mountain finally did. 



I was yanked off my feet like a ragdoll, tossed through the air—then slammed into the rocks below with the force of a car crash. 



I had never been in this much pain. It felt like my consciousness hovered above—my body battered and broken below. I was sure this was it. This was the end. 



At least in death, I’d be with Eilidh. 



I came to—just for a moment. A familiar voice was telling me everything would be okay—that I’d been found, that I was in the hospital.



Then I passed out again. 



I woke up in the hospital, surrounded by beeping machines. There was someone in the room next to me, but I couldn’t move my head to check who it was. 



I could hardly move at all. A groan escaped my throat as I tried to shift—just enough to get a better look.



The sound must’ve woken them.



The woman uncurled from her sleeping position in the chair, blinked her eyes open, and looked at me smiling.



“Bet ye wish ye’d waited fur me noo,” she said softly, laughing gently. 



It was Eilidh. 



My head spun and my hand shot out to grip the bed rail. 



I didn’t speak. I couldn't.



My mind wouldn’t accept what I was seeing. I just stared at her—at Eilidh. Alive. Smiling. Laughing. Looking at me with that same gentle stare. 



I felt the pull of the IV in my arm. Heard the machines. Smelled the sharp sting of disinfectant. 



But none of it made sense. Not with Eilidh sitting beside me. 



*Did I die?* 



*Is this heaven?* 



*Is it hell?* 



Eilidh didn’t notice my silence.



She kept talking—said they’d found me halfway up the mountain. That *she* had called mountain rescue when my Garmin had stopped sending out signals. 



I blinked hard. My Garmin? That was… right. I think. 



But she was here. Talking like it had been her watching me go, her waiting for updates, her calling for help. 



Not the other way around. 



She poured a glass of water and pressed it to my lips. Water dribbled down my chin and soaked into the sheets. 



Eilidh just smiled and set the glass down on the table beside me. “You gave us aw a right fright. Thought ye wurny coming back, ye shouldny huv gone yersel.”



I stared at her.



This wasn’t how it happened. 



I had stayed home. 



She had gone. 



She had never come back. 



But here she was. And none of this was right. 



Something was wrong. 



The door opened and two nurses stepped in, followed by a doctor holding a clipboard. 



Eilidh stood and stretched slightly.



“Ah’ll get oot yer road, been choking for a coffee anyway” she said before giving me a wink and slipping out the door.



I wanted to call her back, ask her what the hell was going on—but my throat was still raw, and my brain felt like it was still up there on the mountain. 



The doctor glanced at my chart, “You’ve got a long recovery ahead of you. How are you feeling?”



I croaked, “Where… where am I?”



“You’re at the Royal Infirmary. You were found alone near the summit two days ago. Severe exposure, concussion, a few cracked ribs. You’re lucky.”



I blinked, “Who found me?”



The doctor hesitated. “Mountain rescue. Your friend, Eilidh, called them. She saved your life.”

 

I stared at him. 



“She’s not listed as one of your emergency contacts,” he added, almost to himself. “But since she made the call, we thought it best to let her stay. Familiar faces can be grounding—especially after significant trauma.”



I swallowed. “What about my parents? Do they know I’m here?” 



A flicker of concern passed over his face. “With a concussion like yours, a little confusion is normal. Let’s focus on your recovery for now. We can talk more later, once you’ve rested.” 



That set off alarm bells in my head. 



*Wit did he mean confusion? A remember everything just fine.* 



But before I could press him, the nurses were already gone—and the doctor followed close behind, leaving me alone with a ringing in my ears and Eilidh’s voice still echoing in my mind. 



The more I thought about her, the more something felt off. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it—until she came back into the room. 



Eilidh's eyes were the wrong colour. ",1,1744373958.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

1jwocoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1jwocoa/rto_help/,RTO Help,"Hi all,

I just took a new job that requires me to be in the office 5 days, at least for the first several months to a year. For me this means commute by bus, and a 10 minute walk on either side of it, both ways.

I live in Pittsburgh PA which means it could be raining, snowing etc, and often times that means I have an umbrella, change of shoes for wet commutes and also a puffer jacket for very cold days (we are still in this territory now).

Currently I carry: 

..Calpak Kaya backpack (laptop, mouse, cord, notebook, and shoe change if I need it, packed lunch Tupperware.. shoes go in leather bag if I have a lunch)

..Portland Leather Mini Crossbody Tote (pocketbook, phone, earbuds, bus pass, building Id, sunglasses, women items)

..some days I use the building gym and will bring a 3rd bag (literally the bag Lulu gives you when you buy something) with my gym sneakers, leggings and a top in it.  

..most days I carry a coffee Yeti in my hand


I feel a little like a pack mule on all of these days, but especially on gym days because I will have taken off work clothes to use the gym (remain in gym clothes for the ride home) and am trying to stuff a whole work outfit (this time of year could be bulky sweater) into all 3 of these bags, while trying to avoid my stuff falling all over the place on the bus while I'm digging for a bus pass.

I don't love the idea of putting quick grab items in the backpack because it feels cumbersome to have to take the bag on and off to get out the bus pass or phone or ID, especially in a puffy coat where it is not a smooth operation to do so. It makes me feel like I do need a second bag, but what?? Larger? Smaller? 

Also I would like this bag solution to be flexible enough to work with a professional work outfit but also something I can carry on the weekends. This is why I have historically gone brown leather.

Right now I love the look of the Madewell woven tote (or quince version for le$$) and wondering if something like that could be the new gym day bag plus the Caya, with my quick items in a dressier belt bag that goes inside the tote on those days, but is just worn as a crossbody on non tote days to avoid having to change items in different bags daily. (Recipe for left behind essentials) BUT this is kind of still 3 bags. Ugh!

Thanks for any advice or suggestions!!

1jwocjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jwocjn/any_downside_to_larger_drippers/,Any downside to larger drippers?,"Hi caffeinated friends,

I tragically broke my beloved Hario 02 glass dripper the other day and need to buy a replacement. 

I often make coffee for two, and like larger cups of coffee, so I end up pretty much maxing out what the 02 can handle, which in my experience, is around ~65g of grounds. (I usually brew ~1:10-1:12 so that nets roughly 650mL of coffee.)

Usually I can keep that contained, but on rare occasions, I do experience a little overflow. So I’m thinking about upsizing to an 03. 

Thing is, I do sometimes just make one cup, and the 02 already felt too big for that. I get all in my head about wasting paper, and it’s also tougher to dodge hitting paper when there’s so much more of it and the coffee is kinda crammed in the bottom of the bigger cone. 

So am I doomed to just buy an 01 and an 03 and have two sizes of filters forever? Any downsides to larger drippers in general I don’t know about? Should I just buy a Kalita for my tiny one cause they’re so darn cute and I might buy two anyway? 

Thanks!

[Why China's Rare Earth Curbs Could Devastate US Defense Industry - Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/china-xi-trump-rare-earths-2057930)

[Photo Illustration by Newsweek\/Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/969gs6skw6ue1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd75ea66d0acc78e4c21409c7ad1f5465c16621a)

President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump) knows his hike in tariffs for China's goods to 145 percent will up the ante in a trade war, but Beijing also holds a strong hand with its control of the materials critical for the United States defense industry.

China first responded on April 3 to Trump's initial salvo of 54 percent levies on its exports by placing export restrictions on rare earth elements, which are key for the fighter aircraft that will form the backbone of the U.S. Air Force's next-generation fleet.

Following a deal with Boeing, [Trump has touted the F-47](https://www.newsweek.com/boeing-f-47-fighter-jet-vs-f-22-trump-2048947) as the successor to the F-22 Raptor. But the viability of the U.S. Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program depends heavily on the materials China produces.

They include seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.

""They are definitely arrows in their quiver of how China can respond to these ever increasing tariffs,"" said [Tom Brady](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/tom-brady), professor of practice at the Colorado School of Mines.

""Dysprosium is critical for use in high temperature magnets,"" he told *Newsweek*. ""Jet engines and things like that need high temperature magnets that keep that magnetic quality at very high temperatures.""

Yttrium is required for high-temperature jet engine coatings, high-frequency radar systems and precision lasers. It also allows thermal barrier coatings on turbine blades to stop aircraft engines from melting mid-flight.

# China's Export Controls

These minerals are needed for high-performance magnets and actuators. Metals like titanium, tungsten, and niobium are also essential for structural strength, heat resistance, and stealth coatings.

""China's export controls on key medium and heavy rare earth elements pose significant risks to US national security, defense manufacturing, and high-tech industries,"" said Jamie Underwood from the SFA-Oxford consultancy in a press release on April 5.

He noted how the elements on China's list are needed for high-performance permanent magnets for advanced missile systems and directed energy weapons.

They are relied on by more than just the defense industry; they underpin the creation of computer chips and electric cars. China's move means it can restrict export licenses it issues, giving it a weapon equal to those made from the minerals it controls, which it has wielded before.

***In 2010, China halted rare-earth exports to Japan following tensions between the countries following a boat collision in disputed waters near the Senkaku islands. In July 2023, China restricted exports of gallium and germanium, used in chips, radars, and satellites, in what was seen as a response to American restrictions on technology sales and transfers.***

# ""Make America Critically Mineral Independent Again.""

The White House exempted critical minerals from its tariffs. However, China's move to curb access to its minerals has focused minds on the potential within the U.S. to make up the shortfall domestically.

On March 20, Trump signed an executive order that he said would boost American mineral production, streamline permitting and enhance national security in coordination with the National Energy Dominance Council.

According to the order, the Defense Production Act would also be used to expand domestic mineral production capacity. The order said 70 percent of U.S. rare earths come from China but also noted that Iran and Russia control large mineral deposits.

# APRIL 11th, 2025~Status and Outlook for the U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office

[Status and Outlook for the U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office | Insights | Holland & Knight](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/04/status-and-outlook-for-the-us-department-of-energys-loan-programs)

# Highlights

* The Trump Administration is leveraging the U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office (LPO) as a strategic tool to catalyze private sector investment in energy infrastructure. This approach aims to enhance U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, strengthen supply chains and reinforce the nation's energy dominance.
* The LPO aligns with Trump Administration goals by being an extremely cost-effective policy tool. It leverages the government's balance sheet at a fraction of the cost of grants or tax credits, enabling the deployment of billions of dollars for critical energy projects that create jobs and drive down costs for consumers.
* The recent resurgence of the LPO is largely due to statutory changes made by the 2020 Bipartisan Energy Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act. These laws expanded the program's accessibility, reduced fees, clarified lending terms and introduced new programs to finance clean energy and infrastructure projects.

As President Donald Trump's administration embraces a whole-of-government strategy to scale back federal investments, many assume the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) is once again at a crossroads. Yet, contrary to that perception, the administration appears positioned to leverage LPO as a strategic vehicle for catalyzing private sector investment in energy infrastructure – enhancing U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, strengthening supply chains and reinforcing the nation's energy dominance.

Though this position initially appears contrary to media reports and recent executive orders (EOs), in reality, the LPO fully aligns with the president's goals and objectives as an extremely cost-effective policy tool. Specifically, the program does not require a one-to-one cost expenditure, but instead leverages the government's balance sheet at a fraction of the cost of grants or tax credits. This enables the deployment of billions of dollars for critical energy projects that create jobs and can drive down costs for consumers, but would otherwise be economically unfeasible or not financeable by the private sector alone. When executed properly, as it has been over the past two decades, the program actually generates revenue for the federal government through interest paid on active loans. In fiscal year (FY) 2023, LPO borrowers repaid a combined $556 million in principal and $484 million in interest to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Federal Financing Bank (FFB). This model puts the program in complete alignment with the administration's objective of unleashing American energy at minimal taxpayer expense.

The value of LPO to taxpayers is often misunderstood, partly due to the recent resurgence of the program over the past four years. Though most credit the Biden Administration for the reinvigoration of the program, it stems largely from statutory changes made by the 2020 Bipartisan Energy Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). These laws expanded accessibility to the program by reducing fees, clarifying terms that had previously restricted lending to industry sectors that could not obtain fixed-price, long-term power purchase agreements, and introducing new programs that increased the office's authority to finance clean energy and infrastructure projects. By the end of 2024, the office had announced 53 deals totaling nearly $108 billion in committed project investments while cultivating a robust pipeline of applicants. At the start of President Trump's second term, over 160 applicants were seeking more than $200 billion in loan proceeds to develop their projects, many of which align with the Trump Administration's recent EOs on energy.

During his reelection campaign, President Trump hinted at rolling back elements of the BIL and IRA, which presumably includes LPO. However, the president has shown interest in the program before. Near the end of his first term, he took steps to support LPO, signing an EO in September 2020 that expanded the office's Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Program to promote onshoring supply chains, particularly for critical minerals. Shortly after, in December 2020, LPO issued guidance encouraging companies to apply for loans for projects aimed at producing, processing and recycling critical minerals.

To date, President Trump has appointed leadership to review LPO and ensure it continues to meet its goals over the next four years. Lane Genatowski, former director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), has been selected to lead LPO. Genatowski's experience at ARPA-E – where he supported breakthrough technologies such as nuclear fusion, a [policy priority for DOE Secretary Chris Wright](https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-wright-acts-unleash-golden-era-american-energy-dominance), and developed the ARPA-E Seeding Critical Advances for Leading Energy Technologies with Untapped Potential (SCALEUP) program – positions him well to advance LPO's mission and support the Trump Administration's energy goals. His selection comes on the heels of former LPO Director John Sneed's evaluation of the program and signals the administration's commitment to using LPO for energy innovation and technological advancements, utility infrastructure deployments that decrease rates for taxpayers and onshoring critical mineral development.

The following sets forth what to expect for projects at each stage of the LPO process throughout the remainder of 2025 and beyond.

# Existing Conditional Commitments and Closed Loans: LPO's Commitment to Existing Investments

In March 2025, President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to onshoring critical mineral supply chains by signing an EO aimed at boosting domestic mineral production through regulatory streamlining and both private- and public-sector investments. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""[Key Takeaways from President Trump's Executive Order to Strengthen U.S. Mineral Production](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/03/key-takeaways-from-president-trumps-executive-order-to-strengthen),"" March 26, 2025.) The EO may be leveraged to empower agencies to use unallocated funds to maximize domestic mineral production – including the billions of dollars of lending authority that remain available through both LPO's ATVM and Title XVII Clean Energy Financing programs.

Furthermore, LPO has continued to disburse funds for existing projects. In February 2025, DOE announced a $782 million advance for an alternative jet fuel refinery in Montana – the first significant disbursement by LPO since the implementation of the ""[Unleashing American Energy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/)"" EO, which paused the release of funds appropriated under the IRA and BIL. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""[DOE Funding Pause Update: Week 4](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/02/doe-funding-pause-update-week-4),"" Feb. 18, 2025.) Additionally, in March 2025, DOE approved a $57 million disbursement under a loan guarantee for a project to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan. These disbursements represent continued progress for the 28 active conditional commitments and 25 closed loans and loan guarantees made during the Biden Administration.

This ongoing commitment to funding projects is reflective of DOE's broader strategy for LPO. In a February 2025 interview with *Bloomberg*, Wright noted that LPO's uncommitted funds would continue to be allocated in a matter that advances President Trump's agenda while ensuring the office will comply with the law on the awards it has inherited.

Furthermore, following President Trump's [recent EO](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/reinvigorating-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-industry-and-amending-executive-order-14241/) placing coal at the center of the administration's plans to reclaim energy dominance, Wright announced a series of actions DOE is taking to [unleash coal production](https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-acts-unleash-american-coal-strengthening-coal-technology-and-securing). This includes making $200 billion in low-cost financing from LPO's Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) Program available for coal energy investments, including upgrading energy infrastructure to restart operations or operate more efficiently.

# Looking Ahead: Current and New Applicants

The ""Unleashing American Energy"" EO, which mandates a 90-day pause on the disbursement of funds from the IRA and BIL – including those used for loan guarantees – has impacted LPO's operational timeline. As a result, LPO is not currently accepting new applications (Part 1 and Part 2) through its formal submission portal. However, its outreach and business development team continues to engage with both current and prospective applicants to advance their application materials.

This pause has also delayed applicants' ability to proceed from the Part 2 application to due diligence. However, given the actions, public statements and ongoing communications with applicants that fall within the policy priority areas set forth in the ""Unleashing American Energy"" EO, as well as the new Critical Minerals EO, it is expected that the Trump Administration will continue leveraging LPO to promptly meet its policy objectives.

# Navigating the Future Funding Landscape

Though the administration appears set to use LPO to advance critical energy infrastructure investments, future legislative action could result in budget cuts to the office. Industry stakeholders will play a crucial role in ensuring the LPO's continued viability. The greater the number of companies that express interest in LPO's programs, the harder it will be for Congress to scale back or eliminate it. Applicants who take advantage of the current funding pause to engage with the administration and refine their applications will be better positioned to move through the program swiftly once it reopens.

Advocating for the future of LPO will require emphasizing the program's role as the most cost-effective tool for achieving the objectives outlined in President Trump's ""Unleashing American Energy"" and recent critical minerals EOs. To meet these goals efficiently and minimize taxpayer costs, it is crucial to retain sufficient funding authority within LPO. This includes maintaining funding for various subprograms and a small percentage of the funds allocated by the IRA for credit subsidy costs and program operations. This funding is especially vital to deploy breakthrough technologies such as advanced nuclear and geothermal, which are key to ensuring the U.S. remains a global leader in energy production, infrastructure and innovation. By preserving this small percentage of funding, LPO will continue to benefit taxpayers as loans are repaid with interest.

I’m F25 and I’m honestly at my breaking point with this one. I need outside perspective because my entire family is acting like I’m Hitler for standing my ground.

So, I (25F) am a student software developer and a pretty serious PC gamer in my free time. I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment that I’ve spent years making cozy and functional. I saved up for a long time to build my dream PC setup … triple monitors, custom mechanical keyboard, ergonomic chair, the works. Altogether, my rig is worth a bit over $2,000, and I take care of it like it’s a damn child.

Last weekend, my older sister (30F) asked if she could crash at my place for one night because her apartment was being fumigated, and her husband was out of town. She has a 3-year-old son, Max, who’s… let’s say “spirited.” I love him, but he’s a little chaos goblin. I hesitated, but she swore she’d keep an eye on him and that it’d just be for one night.

They show up Saturday afternoon, and immediately it’s clear she wasn’t kidding about Max being a handful. Within ten minutes of arriving, he’d pulled four books off my shelf, thrown my houseplants on the floor, and spilled juice on my area rug. I tried to stay chill, he’s three, I get it … but I asked my sister politely to please keep him out of my office, where my PC setup is.

She rolls her eyes and goes, “He’s just exploring, he’s curious, it’s normal.” But she closes the office door anyway.

Cut to Sunday morning. I wake up to screaming. Max had apparently woken up before his mom, managed to open the office door, and decided my setup was his new jungle gym.

He pulled down one of my monitors, cracking the screen. He stuck crackers into the PC tower’s ventilation slots (I’m not kidding), yanked out my keyboard’s keycaps, and had colored on my chair with permanent marker. The cherry on top? He poured apple juice INTO the tower. INTO IT.

When I tell you I went silent… I mean dead silent. My sister comes in, sees the damage, and just says, “Oh nooo,” in this incredibly flat tone, like someone knocked over a cup of coffee. I start freaking out, and she has the AUDACITY to say, “You should’ve baby-proofed the room if it was that important to you.”

I lost it. I told her that 1) she KNEW he wasn’t supposed to be in there, 2) this is my space, not a damn daycare, and 3) baby-proofing a $2,000 gaming setup is not a standard requirement for adults living alone.

She told me to “calm down” and said that “he’s just a kid, and stuff is replaceable.” I told her she could replace it then. She said she didn’t have the money right now, but maybe in a few months she could give me a few hundred. I told her that wasn’t acceptable and that she needed to take full responsibility.

She left in a huff and now my whole family is blowing up my phone. My mom says I’m being “materialistic” and should understand that my nephew didn’t mean it. My dad said I should’ve “locked the door” if it was that important. My brother actually said, “Why do you even need three monitors anyway? That’s kind of overkill.”

I’ve filed a claim with my insurance but there’s no guarantee it’ll be covered since it was technically “guest damage.” I also told her that if she does not pay up, I'll take her to court for what happened.

Now I’m getting texts from my sister demanding an apology for “blaming her kid for being curious.” I told her I’d drop it if she covered the cost of repairs and replacements … or at least met me halfway … and she BLOCKED me.

So… Am I overreacting if I take my sister to court over this?

# Lyceum and dime debates gave library start

By FRANCES BADTKE

April 12-18 is National Li­brary Week and it is also close to the date of the 52nd anniversary of the opening of the Sturgeon Bay library.

The history of the local li­brary is most interesting and the following article has been compiled from facts contain­ed in the Advocate files of 1913 and prior years. This is part one of a series of two articles on the Sturgeon Bay library, its beginnings and its growth, from 1865 to the present day.

—————

May 1, 1913 there was a dedication of the new Car­negie library in Sturgeon Bay. Andrew Carnegie, noted philanthropist of the day had donated $12,500 for the building’s construction.

The total cost of the fixtures, steam and water con­nections and electric lights was “expected to exceed the $150 which had been donated.”

According to Mayor Wolter it was gratifying to see such a “splendid turnout on the occasion and congratulations are to be given the city on the securing of so magnificent a structure . . . it is one of the best institutions of which the city can boast.”

District Attorney Henry Graass gave a history of the efforts that had been made to procure the library and had made an exhaustive study of all records available at the time dating back 50 years to 1865. Most of the information he gave was taken from old files of the Advocate.

About a dozen business and professional men of Sturgeon Bay met Dec. 19, 1865 at the old courthouse and formed a group to be known as the Lyceum. Ten cents admission was charged for meetings, la­dies were admitted free, and the proceeds were to go into a fund to start a library for the city. The Lyceum had debates at these meetings, some of the subjects being Negro suffrage, woman’s suffrage, etc. One meeting, a debate on “Civilization not being the consequence of Christianity” became rather heated and newspaper accounts relate that “debate waxed so warm it was not concluded at this meeting but they adjourned some time after midnight and carried it over to the next week.”

The Lyceum set every Mon­day evening as the time of their meetings and the ten cent admission was to be ap­plied to the library fund. In March, 1866 the Sturgeon Bay Association was incorporated by an act of the legislature.

At times when they did not debate such questions as abol­ishment of capital punishment, impeaching the presi­dent of the United States or other such subjects, an in­teresting article was read from one of the numerous patent office reports. There were also recitations, essays and songs, but the report add­ed that there was “no prayer.”

Along about 1872 interest fell off but by this time the group had accumulated over 300 volumes for the library shelves, many from members of Congress and Madison, books of session laws, blue books, patent office reports and “other valuable reading material.”

In 1879 interest in the pro­ject was revived and 80 vol­umes by such authors as Irv­ing, Hawthorne, Scott, George Elliott and other standard authors were added. At that time you could become a per­manent member by paying your dues of $3, either in cash or by donating that value in books. If you were only interested in membership on a temporary basis then a small­er sum was accepted, the amount not being designated.

From 1880 to 1902 the status of the library was in­active and the books were kept in various places, several local attorneys taking their turn at having them in their offices. In 1892 the library was revived and the books were kept for a while at the telephone office, the switch­board operator doubling as librarian.

When the telephone and telegraph offices were dis­continued in 1897 part of the books were stored over Wash­burn’s old feed store and the balance taken to the high school, where they stayed until 1901.

About 1901 the WCTU members and newspapers again revived the project and a literary society was formed by 27 ladies. Their goal was to “establish and maintain a reading room and sitting room for boys and men, to­gether with a coffee room.” The ladies made up a list of essential items for the start of such a project and “do hereby agree to give such articles as are set forth opposite our names—one plate and cup and saucer or one chair, or some other article toward the furnishing of the rooms.”

The ladies called them­selves the Women’s Association. Opening day was March 2, 1901 in the old Schuyler building on Cedar st. According to old records the lunch room was discontinued in August, 1901, the reason not being given.

Books were moved to sev­eral locations from that time until July, 1903 when old rec­ords and books were burned in a fire, with the exception of the portion of the books in LaPlant’s store. This was the library until 1906 when the women turned it over to the city of Sturgeon Bay.

In June, 1902 Mrs. Y. V. Dreutzer began corresponding with Andrew Carnegie’s secretary, telling the need for a library in the city and the efforts of the women toward this end. No answer was re­ceived from Mr. Carnegie and in 1905 the city voted $100 to help maintain the library.

From September, 1906 until April, 1913 books were stored at the Pinney building and from 1910 a Sawyer branch was maintained at Woerfel drug store.

In 1910 correspondence was still being kept up with Mr. Carnegie and after certain necessary formalities, and after the city council passed an ordinance to give $1,250 a year for the maintenance of a library, Mr. Carnegie generously consented to donate the sum of $12,500 for construction of a library in Sturgeon Bay. Negotiations were completed May 2, 1911.

THIS IS ONE of the many signs on display in the “new” library back in 1913. The rule of silence was strictly enforced and girls and boys were not permitted to sit at the same table with each other.

THIS WAS A VIEW of the interior of the Sturgeon Bay library shortly after it was dedicated in 1913. The shelves were still rather empty at this time. The electric light fixtures and furnishings were the latest thing and this library was considered a model for others in the future.

# Library goes from no talking to talking books

This is the concluding portion of the two part history of the Sturgeon Bay library, soon to celebrate its 52nd anniver­sary.

When the library was de­dicated May 1, 1913 there was rejoicing on the part of the many citizens who had devot­ed much time and effort to this project.

Andrew Carnegie had donat­ed $12,500 for the building, the city council had agreed to do­nate $1,250 a year for its upkeep and the people were look­ing forward to the use of the books and periodicals at the library.

The insurance company that handled the insurance on the new building split the insur­ance policy between ten differ­ent companies that he repre­sented and total premium in 1913 was $121.70.

The approximate size of the lot was 100' x 150' and the building contained 2,975 square feet. Total cost of the building, ready for occupancy was listed at $12,666.85 in old library records.

When it came to pay the final bills there was a little discussion as to what was to be included in the original cost and what were to be consid­ered extras.

June 7, 1913 the Library Board wrote the Contractor as follows:

“Your favor of 1st inst. to hand Your items of payment are as we have them. Note your extras for cement floor, we understood that, the change made in that would be no more than to have followed the contract. We also note that you have made no allowance for the failure to have building completed according to con­tract, we had an additional rent of 4 months at 35.00 per month $140.00 and Mr. Gabert claims that you alone were re­sponsible for the delay. Be­fore paying any more of the accounts we would like to have this matter settled.”

The contractor had different ideas and Fred Wulf wrote back to the Library Board on July 3, 1913 as follows: “In regards to the Library building our agreement in article 7 reads that time lost shall be extended. Now I havent brought in no claim in writing but why should you take ad­vantage of same. I was delayed on account of rain and also I couldn’t get Bedford stone you know the roof was on when our front wall was way down. Also the change of the cement floor took some time but I dont believe I am being used right. Had I made any money I wouldn’t mind it, besides you were to furnish heat which was very poor while we plastered and it was not any better after I finished plastering it was certainly late before Gabert could start finishing. I couldn’t ask him to help pay tordst this as he told me he started as soon as the building was dry enough. I asked Wiest to put in more radiators but he said he had­n’t any at the time I plast­ered.

“I wish you would think this over, I am yours as ever, Fred Wulf”

A notation at the bottom of the letter stated that Wulf called three days later and of­fered to settle for $100.

After the final bills were set­tled the Library Board made a number of rules concerning the use of the Library.

“Children under 14 years of age may draw books only on Wednesdays and Saturdays before 6 p.m.; there must be no loud talking in the library; No one may draw books on another’s card unless members of the same family; no book shall be drawn on a card when a fine remains unpaid, nor shall a book be drawn on any other card until said fine is paid.

They also set up a system of fines: “pocket torn out, 5 cents; leaves cut or torn, 15 cents; cover torn off, so it can be mended, 15 cents; cover torn off so as to make it necessary to send it to the bindery, 30 cents.

“These rules will be strictly enforced, /s/ Library Board.”

Boys and girls were not per­mitted to sit together at the same table in the library, nor was anyone permitted to even whisper, even in connection with the studying they were doing at the time. The rule of silence was strictly enforced and persons not observing it were asked to leave the building.

The new library was consid­ered to be one of the finest in the state. The architectural beauty was greatly admir­ed and the floor plan and pic­ture of the building appeared in periodicals of the state com­mission and the building used as a model for other libraries built in the state after 1913.

The original library board consisted of Jno. B. Davis, president; Mrs. C. B. Packard, secretary; Mrs. C. L. Nelson, E. W. Long, H. R. Isherwood, Henry Fetzer and Rudolph Soukup. Also serving on the board during the construction of library were Frank Long, Mrs. Ed Reynolds, August Reiboldt and C. G. Stangel.

The Library Board was most grateful to Andrew Carnegie for his generous gift to the city and sent him a card on his birthday each year. A printed thank you note was received from Mr. Carnegie’s secretary in November, 1915 for their remembering his birthday.

They apparently kept him informed as to the growth and activities of the library for in June, 1917 Miss Grace Lown, librarian, received this letter from the Carnegie Corp.:

“We hav the report which you hav been good enuf to send shoing the activities of the Sturgeon Bay Public Li­brary for the last three years. We rite to ask whether the cost figures as reported by you, $800 being added to the Car­negie grant, making the total $13,330 ar correct.”

The value of the contents of the library increased constant­ly and in 1923 they received advice from the Wisconsin Free Library Commission at Madison as to the correct procedure to follow in valuing the books and contents and how to go about getting full insurance coverage on same. Records of June 1, 1923 show that the in­ventory gave a value of $6,295 on the books and furnishings.

In the early years of the li­brary it was also used as a meeting place for various ci­vic organizations and the Wo­men’s club was permitted to use the assembly room biweekly from September to May of each school year. All associations for civic improve­ment and charitable purposes were also granted the same privileges.

Through the years the library patronage has grown and grown until it seems as though on some evenings when the students are doing school as­signments that the walls must be bulging outward.

In 1913 Sturgeon Bay had a population of 4,262, abort half of the present 7,353 inhabitants. That first year there were 2,673 books on the shelves with 249 added during the year and circulation reached 17,194.

In 1963 the number of books totaled 15,736 and 1,188 were added during the year, bring­ing total circulation to 73,256. In March, 1964 a total of 5,902 books were checked out at the Sturgeon Bay unit.

In 1945 free library service was voted to the entire Door county. County residents could borrow books from the city library without a charge.

In the fall of 1949 it was voted to extend service to the county and a Bookmobile was purchased in February, 1950 for about $5,600. This was in conjunction with Kewaunee county and the state paid half of the expenses in connection with the State Demonstration Library system. In the 1952 fall elections Kewaunee chose to sever relations with this set up and Door county continued on alone. A new Bookmobile was authorized recently by the county board and this one will cost about $13,000 because of the rise in prices of such ve­hicles.

Other services have been added through the years by the library as the demands grew and 16 mm. movie films and over 750 film strips (together with equipment from county to show them) are available now. The films are changed each month through a special service and are available to groups at a nominal charge.

Persons who have limited sight or are blind may obtain “Talking Books” through the assistance of the library. These records and a machine to play them may be obtained without charge to those who qualify. Contact the library for full details.

Librarians will obtain special books for patrons from the library at Madison and if there is any subject in which you are interested and the local li­brary has no books on that sub­ject, they will obtain them for you from the Traveling library service.

The librarians also answer all sorts of questions. They help out with school work for students, help find information for themes and reports, look up answers to questions of all kinds and tell where to find any books you might want. They also conduct a summer reading program for young­sters.

A very young library patron the other day wanted to know, “Where are your books on goldfinches and foxes?” He was directed to two separate volumes and finding what he wanted went away happy.

1jwo3s0,https://i.redd.it/ozc9eg8047ue1.jpeg,We’re officially clinic grads! ….we’re officially clinic grads?!,"We went in yesterday at 6+5 despite originally being scheduled for our final US around 7+3. I had some stroooooooong cramping and spotting they wanted to check so we went early. 

Little man had an FHR of 120 and is perfectly on track! My clinic does one placement scan and one heartbeat scan before graduation, barring any abnormalities or need for follow up. I just never thought we’d become grads so quickly after our first FET. I always reminded myself it takes 2 FETs on average for success. The little customized onesie they gifted us before leaving our last appointment is just SO cute to me. 

This is just surreal and I’m so elated to be planning announcement photos. We sent over coffee and donuts to the clinic this morning as a thank you / graduation gift. My next follow up is with my regular OB at 8+5 and I’m counting down the seconds ",5,1744372828.0,IVFbabies,2,1.0,False

1jwo0tr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jwo0tr,What is my coffee tree telling me,"Unnecessary backstory - Ive got two of these coffee trees i started from a tiny nursery pot that originally had about 9 stems in it that i thinned down to 4, about a year and a half ago i separated the roots and potted them individually, gave 2 away, kept the other two.

The question at hand - One of my coffee trees is growing these leaves that look almost variegated but I’m having difficulty figuring out what its trying to tell me with this new development. Does this look like a nutrients issue or more viral and if so is it treatable

Its usual care routine is that i water it when the soil is mostly dried, somewhat alternating between top watering and bottom watering. it’s in a clear pot so i can see how dry the soil is and the roots around the outside of the pot look fine. It normally sits in front of a southwest facing window with a grow light over it for the winter. It was repotted last September in fresh soil with slow release fertilizer granules mixed in. The soil is a mix of regular potting soil, extra perlite, and a bit of orchid bark to keep it a lil chunkier

Picture 3 is its sister plant from the same original pot for comparison of leaf health, and was also repotted at the same time in the same soil mix

Further information would be that I’ve been keeping the thrips army at bay with mosquito dunks and insecticide spray (Canadian and systemics are not an option here) and had a brief encounter with aphids last year that i unleashed lady bugs as my counter attack, those have since been handled, other than that no pests have been spotted and advice would be very appreciated 🙏🏻",2,1744372539.0,plantclinic,1,1.0,False

Headache and nausea by bedtime, and hoped to sleep through some of that but it was rough. Tried both ibuprofen and acetaminophen which maybe took the edge off and then a bonine. Woke up feeling about the same, plus slightly sweaty and feverish. 

I did get some sleep but restless and intermittent. I also have sinus problems which contributes to both sleep and headache issues on a normal basis for me so this is just adding more physical discomfort. 

I’m now sipping a coffee with some soy milk so I don’t go into caffeine withdrawal to add another headache factor but it’s hard to get it down. 🤢 At least, already have less than zero appetite. 

I have not read about exactly how these drugs work but it seems like it just makes you feel too sick and nauseated to eat anything - which you’d think there could have been earlier and cheaper drugs to just make a person feel that way! 🤣

I know from other posts to drink water and eat protein (doesn’t sound good at all) and that the worst should pass in a day or so and it gets better in successive weeks and the side effects are also signs it’s actually working.

1jwnup8,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1jwnup8/tifu_by_projecting_my_past_drug_use_onto_my_wifes/,TIFU by projecting my past drug use onto my wife’s autism,"(Obligatory “this happened over the past few months, but the full realization just hit me, so I guess that counts, right?” disclaimer.)
So… TIFU by being an absolute moron and thinking my wife was a junkie. Yeah, I’m that guy.
A bit of backstory: In my foolish youth, I had a not-so-little fling with cocaine. Not my proudest moment, but hey, at least I learned how to spot coked-up behavior from a mile away. Fast-forward a decade, I’m happily married to my lovely wife, who has ADHD. She’s been on Concerta for a while (like, medically prescribed by a psychiatrist and everything). But thanks to my old party brain, I was certain her ADHD meds were making her behave as if she was hopped up on cocaine.
Her “cocaine-like” behavior? She’d talk nonstop about her new favorite subject until my ears actually considered running away from my head. She’d get super fixated on politics, activism, and feminism for hours, do these weird little repetitive movements with her hands, and sometimes come across as just plain blunt. You know, like someone who forgot their social filters at home. I was so sure she was abusing her meds in secret, I half-expected to see her snorting lines off the coffee table.  

But did I ask her directly like a normal human being? Noooo. Of course not. Because obviously, she was going to rip my head off for accusing her of being a druggie. So instead, I decided to create this weird, paranoid dynamic where I was always side-eyeing her as she happily took her prescribed medication. Every time she’d do some “strange” stuff—like rocking back and forth, or talking with a monotone voice about the intersectionality of modern feminist theory for three hours (suddenly, feminism was the epicenter of her universe; I know more about third-wave feminist discourse than I do about my own mother)—I’d just assume, “Welp, that’s the coke talking.”  

These “coke suspicion” vibes turned me into a massive jerk. I’d snap at her for being rude, or I’d avoid conversation because I didn’t want to feed her mania (I’m an idiot, I know). We started having fights that sounded totally insane from her perspective:  

Her: “Why are you so dismissive every time I’m telling you about how activism strategies evolved in the ‘70s?!” Me: “Because I’m not sure you’re even… sober right now?”  

Spoiler: She was always sober—like, literally on the correct dosage of an FDA-approved medication. My efforts to “contain the crisis” were basically me being a colossal a-hole.  

Eventually, the fights got so bad that she brought them up to her psychiatrist. Cue the biggest TIFU: the doctor runs an evaluation and goes, “Hmm… you might be autistic.” Turns out her ADHD meds were tamping down the ADHD symptoms, which left her autistic traits more obvious than ever. So her “stimmy” hand movements, intense monologues about niche topics (like the historical shifts in feminism, or the intricacies of different activist movements), abrupt bluntness, and total disregard for standard small-talk-lingua were textbook autism signs.  

In the end, she got an official autism diagnosis! Now, instead of being a junkie, she’s… just autistic. I’d basically spent months writing a paranoid mental fanfic about my wife as this secret coke fiend, all because I recognized “signs” from my own past drug use. Meanwhile, she just had a combination of conditions that made her appear super intense and occasionally socially clueless.
To top it off, she insisted I write this exact post as an apology on her behalf (well, more like an apology to her, but she requested Reddit see it for comedic justice). So yeah, dear wife, I’m sorry for:  

* Every time I gave you a suspicious glare while you popped your perfectly legal, much-needed meds.  

* Every conversation I walked away from because I was worried you were “tweaked” when really you just really love talking about political activism and feminist theory.  

* Every meltdown I caused by implying you were coked out when you were just having a meltdown… or maybe meltdown is the wrong word. Neurospicy meltdown?  

I messed up big time. Please accept my wife’s new special interest in endless monologues about crocheted cat sweaters as a peace offering, because apparently that’s next on the hyperfocus list. And yes, I promise from now on, I’ll ask honest, caring questions before deciding the love of my life is hopped up on illicit substances.  

TL;DR: TIFU by thinking my wife was abusing her ADHD meds because she acted “coked up.” After nearly destroying our marriage with my secret suspicions, we found out she’s actually autistic. Now I’m the jerk who has to apologize to the internet for being a paranoid idiot. She is very much not a druggie—just an autistic ADHDer who really likes talking about politics, activism, and feminism (and apparently crocheted cat sweaters). Sorry, babe.

1jwnrh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jwnrh8/sf_the_abandoned_storage_locker/,[SF] The Abandoned Storage Locker,"My name is Michael, and I bought a storage locker hoping to flip the contents for a little extra cash. I’d never done this before, so I had no idea what I was getting myself into. My wife thought it was a total waste of time and money, but it was something I’d always wanted to try.

I won the auction and went to check out the locker. Everything inside was basically junk—old boxes, broken furniture, piles of trash. Except for one thing: an old desktop computer. It was strange because it was still plugged in, still set up… and still working.

Curious, I tapped a random key on the keyboard, and it immediately booted up. The screen lit up, but there were no icons—no programs, no folders—just a single prompt asking for a date. That was it. No password screen. No desktop. Just a blinking cursor next to the word: “DATE.”

It was weird, for sure. And honestly, I felt like I’d just spent $400 on a piece of ancient tech from the ’90s. Not exactly a win.

A few hours later, after tossing out all the junk, the only thing left in the locker was the desk, the chair, and that odd computer. I sat back down, thinking maybe it was just locked behind some kind of password. I typed in a bunch of random keys, but nothing happened.

My wife called, wondering where I was and what I was doing. I told her about the weird computer and read her what was on the screen. After a pause, she said, “Why don’t you try typing in a date instead of a password?”

We hung up. I figured, why not? I typed in a random date from a few years back, hit Enter… and nothing. Disappointed, I stood up, opened the locker door, and headed toward my truck.

But my truck wasn’t there.

And it was night.

Just seconds ago, it had been broad daylight.

My heart started to race. Confused, I pulled out my phone to call my wife—but it didn’t work. The screen read: SIM failure.

I thought maybe it was a glitch… or a power outage… or, hell, maybe the apocalypse had just started while I was sitting in that locker.

Trying to make sense of it, I walked to the nearest gas station. That’s when things got even stranger. On the shelves, I saw candy that had been discontinued years ago. I half-joked with the cashier, “When did they bring these back?”

He looked at me like I was high.

Then I asked if I could borrow his phone—told him mine wasn’t working. When I pulled my phone out, his eyes went wide.

“What kind of phone is that?” he asked.

“Just an iPhone 16,” I said, still confused.

He looked stunned. “How’d you get one of those already?”

I stared at him, completely lost. Nothing made sense. I just nodded and said, “I’ll see you around.”

I walked out and called a cab to take me home.

When I got to my house, I stood at the front door, but something told me not to go in. I peeked through the window—and froze. I saw myself, sitting at the dinner table with my family. My son dropped his plate, just like I remembered him doing years ago.

That’s when it hit me: I had lived this moment. I wasn’t just in the past—I was living through a memory.

Shaken, I hurried back to the storage unit. I typed in the current date, hit Enter, and opened the locker door. It was daylight again. My truck was there. I immediately called my wife and asked if she and the kids were okay.

She said, “We just spoke seconds ago. Is everything alright?”

I told her yes, and that I’d be home soon.

But I couldn’t let it go. I had to try again.

I went back into the locker, shut the door behind me, and typed in a date—one year ago. I opened the locker and stepped out. Nothing seemed drastically different, but the roads were smoother, fewer potholes. I looked for little signs. Then I found a newspaper—and sure enough, it was from exactly one year ago.

Still not fully convinced, I walked to a local Denny’s and asked the waitress what year it was. She gave me a weird look, but answered. It was true. I was in the past.

Before heading back, I stopped at a corner store and grabbed a few snacks and drinks. I wanted to see if I could bring something back. I returned to the locker, closed the door, typed in the present date, and hit Enter.

When I stepped out—the snacks were still with me.

I had brought something back from the past.

It was astounding… and terrifying.

I locked the unit and went home, unsure of what to do next. I wanted to tell my wife, but I knew she’d never believe me. I wasn’t even sure I believed me.

But there was one person I could trust.

My best friend, Vince.

I called him the next day and told him to be ready—I’d be outside his house, and he needed to keep an open mind. He asked a million questions, but I just told him I’d explain later. His place was only ten minutes from the storage unit.

When I picked him up, I told him I needed help moving some stuff—wouldn’t take long. We got to the unit, and he looked around, confused.

“There’s just a computer and a desk,” he laughed. “What are we moving?”

“Just get in and shut the door,” I said.

He did, still laughing.

“I can’t explain it,” I told him. “I can only show you. Give me a date.”

He grinned. “Alright. December 25, 2010.”

I’d never gone back that far before, but figured—why not?

I entered the date and looked at him. “You ready?”

“Yeah, sure,” he laughed.

I hit Enter.

This time, the room shook. It felt like a small earthquake. That had never happened before.

I walked to the locker door, looked at him, and said, “Just watch.”

I opened the door—and the world had changed.

The buildings that had stood nearby weren’t there yet. We stepped outside, and he froze.

“Where did everything go?” he asked.

“I don’t know how,” I said. “But this computer… it’s a time machine.”

We walked around 2010. Things we’d forgotten were suddenly right in front of us. Stores. People. Music. Decorations. It was Christmas time, and the town felt alive in a way it hadn’t in years.

Our phones didn’t work at all.

We visited an old shopping center, now long gone in our time. It was beautiful. Nostalgic. Surreal.

Eventually, we made our way back to the unit. Vince didn’t say a word. I entered the current date, hit Enter, and we were back.

He sat in the passenger seat, stunned.

“I need a minute to think,” he finally said.

“Yeah,” I replied. “I know.”

I drove Vince home. He said we’d talk tomorrow, and I agreed. When I got home, my wife was upset. She thought I was hiding something, maybe even cheating. I brushed it off and told her everything was fine—and went to bed.

The next day, Vince and I didn’t even go to work. We met at the unit and set up a small sofa to talk things through. He didn’t want to ever use the machine again, but I convinced him to try it one last time—for the lottery. Just a week back. Nothing crazy.

He agreed. We got the winning numbers and traveled a week into the past, bought a ticket, and returned to the present. Mega Millions was at 400 Million After Taxes.

We scanned the ticket—and there it was.

A winner.

We jumped up and down, breathless and stunned. We claimed it. Life was changed forever.

But a few months later, I couldn’t shake the itch. I called Vince to meet me at the unit. I told him I wanted to go further back—maybe see a JFK speech, or what life was like in the ‘50s or ‘60s.

He said no.

“We’ve got what we wanted. There’s no reason to use this thing again.”

But I couldn’t help myself. As soon as he left, I typed in: 07/04/1960.

The unit shook violently this time. When I opened the door, I stepped into another era. I hadn’t brought cash or proper clothes—but I didn’t care. I was in the 60s. Everything was simpler. More vivid. More real.

A man at a diner offered me a job delivering newspapers. I stayed in the 60s for over a year. I loved it—the food, the music, the energy. Even the coffee tasted better.

Eventually, though, I started to miss my family. I went back to the locker and typed in the present date.

When I stepped out, Vince was just walking to his truck. I called to him and told him I’d been gone for a year and a half.

He stared at me in disbelief. “You were just in there for a second.”

Then he saw the vintage suit I was still wearing. He believed me.

But he was mad. Disappointed. He made me promise I’d never do something like that again.

I said I wouldn’t.

But I was lying.

Back in the present, everything felt dull. Flat. Artificial. The lottery winnings didn’t make life better—they just made it easier. I missed the past. Desperately.

So I started writing journals. Creating logs. Planning short trips back every week.

One Sunday, while in 1962, I saw her.

Julie.
She was unlike anyone I’d ever met. Naturally beautiful. Kind. Warm.

We bumped into each other. We talked. We laughed. We had dinner.

I was falling in love.

Then one night, back in the present, I slipped up. I left my journal in the car,

My wife found it.

She confronted me, furious and betrayed. I couldn’t lie. I couldn’t gaslight her. She slept in the other room that night, and the next day was filled with silence.

I knew I had to make a choice.

And I did.

That Sunday, I didn’t go back to the locker. I didn’t touch the computer.

Instead, I sat with my wife. I apologized. I told her everything. The truth, beginning to end.

She didn’t believe me—but she saw the pain in my eyes. She saw how real it all was to me.

We cried. We talked.

And finally… we started to heal.

I haven’t been back to the storage locker since.

But some nights, when I close my eyes, I can still smell the diner coffee. I can still hear Julie’s laugh. I can still feel the crisp, colorful air of a world that’s long gone.

And sometimes, I wonder…

If I ever did go back again—
Would I come home?

We’ve kind of landed on Punta Cana as the Caribbean was our target and we’re really looking for the most bang for our buck.

 My wife and I are craft coffee drinkers at home and she makes a few oat milk lattes daily while I enjoy a nice Americano or pour over.  Are there any resorts that have a standout coffee offering?

Bonus points if there’s also a place to snag a green juice/smoothie on site… as that’s my go-to after overindulging!

1jwnqxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1jwnqxj/my_mom_is_forcing_me_to_apologise_to_bhua/,My mom is forcing me to apologise to bhua,"A little backstory.

I (16f) hate my bhuas. Especially the younger one(34f). In short, she's a selfish bitch, only cares about her Instagram (pretends to be a celebrity with bheeg me mange 1k followers), back-talks about *every single* person she's ever talked to, thinks she's the best at everything and has an impeccable fashion sense (she's been forcing me to wear short and revealing clothes since i was young and very very uncomfortable, calling it 'fashion' when the word fashion only means short and revealing clothes to her), has forced her husband to spend a LOT of money for trivial things (her in laws have financial problems), acts all chipku with the person who's the limelight (here, the bride).

They both don't give a fuck about anything, are in the room with ac on ALL DAY with my dadi when my mom is running behind them, bringing them tea, doing every household chore (no maid and we have a fairly big house) while they fucking bark their orders. 

The worst part? There was another marriage in January this year, and my dad was beating my mom in front of everyone because everyone was at home (because, of course, they only went for their pictures and don't give a damn about the actual ceremony) after a function except her (she had to stay for a rasam and came at 11). I was crying begging for him to stop saying that rubbish and abusing her while they both took a stroll right when all of this was happening with a coffee mug. THEY DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING SEE WHAT HE WAS DOING, HOW BAD HE WAS HURTING HER. I'd cried for a week after that day because of how bad it had impacted me, was scared of every man I came across, I haven't explained it here but just to *hear* everything he said was traumatic.

I find all these enough reasons to hate them. They've made my life hell everytime they came for vacations. My dadi with both of the bhuas is the worst combination EVER. 

Rant done. Now, the problem.

A close cousin is getting married so both of them have come with their monster kids. I hadn't talked to them on the phone since that day and said I was busy studying (because I was). Now she sits on the sofa and says, ""Baat kyu nhi ki? Aisi kaha busy thi maharani?"" with that same arrogant tone. I just said I had exams and I was stressed. (Btw, 'baat' for her isn't the normal talk. After every baat, she asks me to edit her video audio or some shit so she can post it. And that happened every 2 days. I complied for 2 weeks and then I was done. I didn't have time to waste on her stupidity.) 

I came to my mom's room (because they've hijacked mine, of course), and mom comes and shouts at me saying that was no way to talk. Now, I didn't even say anything to her, I just said I was busy so what was fucking wrong in that? I've had bad blood with her since the first time I saw her, every time I talk to her she makes me feel insecure, uncomfortable like I shouldn't exist. My mom asked me to say sorry and go talk to her and said I was 'badtameez'. I said I wouldn't. To someone who's always hurt me over and over again yet I never said anything, nor am I going to now, so what's so bad about distancing myself?

Am I wrong?

TLDR- my bhuas are selfish af, have hurt me a lot since I was too little to understand anything, always make me feel insecure and uncomfortable. I started distancing myself from them because, surprise, I wanted to prioritise my mental peace. When the younger bhua asked me why I haven't been talking and I said that I've been busy with exams, my mom forced me to apologise to her which I refused because I don't think I was being badtameez when I said that.",1,1744371586.0,TeenIndia,3,1.0,False

Over the last 5 years, it’s been a cycle of tapering, relapsing, “just one a day,” “just to noon,” then back to black coffee all day long.

From age 20 to 30, I was the warrior diet guy, no breakfast, just black coffee and grind mode from sunrise to dinner. These days, I eat breakfast like a normal person… but the caffeine habit is still alive and kicking.

Every couple of months I try to cut back—switch to tea, then cocoa, sometimes dandelion. And when I do, I notice the changes:
Dreams come back.
Face looks fresher.
Energy is calmer.
But eventually, the hot black drug pulls me back in.

It doesn’t help that I work as a project manager, meetings, emails, admin, deadlines. Coffee seems essential in this role.

But when I don’t drink it? I just want to sit in the sun, barefoot, under a tree..

Lately, I’ve been having this recurring thought, maybe this whole caffeine rollercoaster wasn’t for nothing. Maybe I’ve been through it so I can come out the other side and help others do the same.
Break the chain.
Wake up.
Different brain waves. Different life.

So here’s the plan:
No coffee for 30 days.
Write a book.
Create a course.
Charge $79 for it, something to help people quit caffeine for at least 21 days. That’s 21 fewer coffees (~$6 each), so you’re basically $47 richer just by doing the maths.

Side thought:
My mortgage is $37,466 a year.
If 474 people buy the course, I could take a gap year, hit the road with my family, and travel around Australia.
(No hidden agenda, just a dream. But first and foremost, it’s about helping people. Service comes first.)
 
Do people actually want to quit coffee?

Anyway, time to flush the black poison out of my body, write this course, and hopefully help a few people wake up and live better.

Let’s go.

1jwnnqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jwnnqt/its_a_killer_blow_but_all_control_for_them/,It's a killer blow but all control for them,"I was always someone who integrated, had friends, things I enjoyed in life, I was independent and although I went through a few rough patches, things were ok. 


Things went awfully downhill when I had the misfortune to meet a new friend and we became good friends quite quickly. They'd never properly had friends (and were insecure) so the friendship with me was like the best thing since sliced bread to them and by their own words they were worried I'd see their true colours and end the friendship. 


When I got in a relationship, this friend branded me a user because I couldn't spend as much time with them anymore but that was never the case. The friendship continued regardless and the relationship didn't work out anyway. 


This friend came up with an idea to get me on the property ladder as they had the money to do so. I'd have said no way but I began having a tough time where I lived (new nightmare neighbours moved in next door), that I felt I had no choice. They'd buy somewhere for me to live with a mortgage, I'd move in as a tenant and when financially stable enough would have the option to buy it from them. 


As I'd then left my home due to those neighbours and was sofa surfing, I needed things to happen as quickly as possible, but I had to rely on them to view areas and places as I don't drive. There was no urgency from them and it felt like they liked that control over me. They'd live their own life miles away from me as usual and then I'd get one afternoon every few weekends to get in their car and look at areas. 


It just dragged on so much.... For 2 years in fact with my mental health at an all time low I just had to pick anywhere really to give it a go and have a fresh start in my own home. They suggested a town which on paper seemed ok, so after visiting the area just twice, an offer was made on a house and I moved in as I was so desperate to try something. 


The killer blow was where it didn't take long to find out this gamble hadn't paid off. The town is empty with nothing to do, it's very difficult to make friends here and with not being able to drive, I can't do anything for myself. Yeah, this friend has me trapped here having to rely on them to drive down and see me so I get a day out or to do essentials like taking my dog to the vets as no vets are taking on here. 


With that new level of control over me, they can speak to me or treat me any way they like knowing I can't walk away. They are argumentative, say bad things towards me, even mock me for stuff and use my disability against me and I still have to hang around with them. 


I can't move and rent privately as I run my business from home (it's my job, private landlords aren't happy taking on tenants with businesses run from home as it invalidates their insurance due to being seen as an increased burglary risk) plus I have a dog which they tend not to like tenants having. I can't buy my own home either. 


So that's me up the creek. Cut off isolated, can't do anything I enjoy in life, lonely with nobody in my life (apart from this 'friend') and I simply spend my days sat around watching TV, sleeping, working and doing some dog walks waiting for this 'friend' to have their life as normal miles away, for me to then have 1 short visit for an afternoon every 2 weeks, having them for company and going out in their car doing some of the things I enjoy for a few hours.  


I'm rock bottom, feel low all the time and ever since I moved here it's felt like my life is finished. It feels like they got what they wanted and probably what they planned, to make it so I could never end the friendship. 


Any problem I have with them over what they've said or done is just brushed aside, in fact they'll usually argue with me for the sake of it knowing I can't walk away. 


I hate, absolutely loathe them because of their actions and way they speak to me and they know it but it doesn't bother them. They still have their life and then for one afternoon every few weeks know they have me to have a coffee and chat with, a beer at the pub, even a meal in a restaurant because if I refused, I'd never get to do those things and it would finish me off.

**ACT I: *Dust, God, and a Little Bit of Theater***

It began with the air—not the kind that smells like memory or bread, but the kind that makes people nervous. By the middle of May, the town of Elbow Falls sat under a heat like a held breath. It hadn't rained in six weeks, the cornfields were crisping, and men had taken to standing in front of their stores with their hands on their hips, as if they could coax the wind into returning with just enough spine.

Mayor Elijah Crayton knew the truth. No storm was coming. Not unless he made one.

The town was dying. It had been a slow death, polite in its pace but ruthless in direction. The tannery closed the previous winter, the last good cotton harvest was a boyhood memory, and the last two weddings in town had involved cousins. Tourism, in the form of a mineral spring that supposedly cured rickets, had dried up after a traveling nurse declared the water ""just plain wet.""

What Elbow Falls had left was its church bells, its parables, and a reputation for hospitality strong enough to sugar-coat most of its sins. And Elijah, bless him, had been mayor for seven years by running unopposed and smiling like a sermon. He knew people didn’t need honesty—they needed a reason. And with federal money drying up and the train route threatening to skip them altogether, he needed something dramatic. Something divine.

So when Clara Wynn, the schoolteacher whose handwriting was so neat it bordered on suspicious, made an offhand comment about Charles Darwin and “scientific frameworks” during a lesson on animals, Elijah felt the idea slide into place like a coin into a crooked slot. She wasn’t fiery, wasn’t political—just bright enough to catch attention, just gentle enough to be forgivable later.

“Elbow Falls doesn’t need a savior,” Elijah muttered that night to his glass of peach liquor, “it needs a scandal.”

He called a meeting. Not in city hall—that would’ve felt too formal, too suspicious. Instead, he invited a few key men (and one well-dressed woman) to the back room of Priddy’s Print Shop, where the air smelled of ink and ambition. Reverend Josiah Mayfield was the first to arrive, a man whose sermons had made children cry and women swoon—sometimes at the same time. His eyes were flinty, humorless, but he listened well.

“What if,” Elijah began, fingers steepled, “we make our own storm? Not to scare the flock, but to bring in a better shepherd.”

Mayfield scowled. “You’re speaking riddles again, Crayton.”

“I’m talking about fire. Not the real kind. The kind that draws moths. Journalists. Preachers. Northern lawyers with agendas and billfolds. Imagine the headlines—*‘God on Trial in Elbow Falls.’* You think they won’t come? You think they won’t fill our inns and eat our food and pay to sit in the courthouse?”

The others looked around at each other. A mechanic, a grocer, the owner of the two-piano saloon. None of them wanted to say it out loud, but they’d each been dreaming of something big enough to save their ledgers. One by one, they nodded.

Mayfield didn’t. He watched Elijah like a man weighing a snake. “And who gets burned for this miracle?”

Elijah smiled. “No one permanent. Clara’s got no family here. No husband. She’ll be famous before they hand down a verdict.”

Outside, the sun slipped behind the church steeple, casting its shadow long and sharp across Main Street. Inside the print shop, the presses were already humming with the first batch of broadsheets:

**“Local Schoolteacher Defies Bible in Science Class. Trial Imminent.”**

They didn’t print a photo. Not yet. Let the mystery stew.

In the weeks that followed, Clara was arrested without cuffs—more like an invitation to dinner than a charge. She was confused, then indignant, but not stupid. She could see it in the way people looked at her—curious, cautious, and already rewriting her in their minds. She had become the story. She hadn’t chosen it, but in Elbow Falls, no one got to pick their own headlines.

And the people? They rose to the occasion like revivalists to a tent pole. By the third Sunday, Mayfield’s church was standing room only. The guestbook at Miss Beverly’s boarding house had two New York names and a reporter from Atlanta. Priddy had started selling souvenir pamphlets with phrases like *“I stood with the Lord in Elbow Falls”* and *“Clara Wynn: The Jezebel of Biology.”*

Elijah stood in the doorway of his office one evening, watching the street swell with pilgrims and rubberneckers. The lights glowed warmer. The stores stayed open later. The town was waking up.

He lit a cigarette and exhaled slow.

“It’s working,” he said to no one in particular. And in the distance, the church bells rang like they’d just remembered how.

---  

**ACT II: *The Gospel Circuit***

By the second week of June, the town of Elbow Falls had more opinions than it had chairs. It wasn’t just that the visitors were pouring in—it was that they stayed, argued, bought coffee twice, and asked for directions like they already knew the way. The courthouse steps became a kind of theater, and the trial hadn’t even begun. Tourists clutched Bibles like passports, while others carried little notebooks and muttered words like *“hypocrisy,” “backward,”* and *“sociological opportunity.”* Somewhere between the stage and the sermon, Elbow Falls became America’s argument.

Silas Drake stepped off the evening train with a briefcase and a tie that had seen war. He’d once represented a union that threw bricks at Pinkertons, and now he mostly sued newspapers on behalf of misunderstood professors. He smelled the town before he saw it—honeysuckle, tobacco, and that particular Southern humidity that makes every man feel overdressed. He liked it.

Walt Priddy met him at the station. “Welcome to the furnace,” he said, shaking hands with a little too much theater.

Drake squinted. “I assume there’s an icebox in the courtroom?”

Priddy smiled like a man already selling popcorn. “No, but we got fans and shade, and the judge likes to sweat with the rest of us.”

They walked toward town, past signs advertising lemonade, shaded prayer circles, and paid seats under the awning during opening statements. Local children were charging five cents for directions to the schoolhouse. A man dressed as the Devil passed by on stilts, handing out tracts that read *“Science is the Real Snake.”*

Drake paused. “Does your chamber of commerce take tithes?”

Priddy shrugged. “We just call it collection.”

The courtroom itself had been scrubbed down, polished, and shined within an inch of its wooden soul. It had never seen this much foot traffic, and the benches creaked under the weight of so many outsiders, each one a pilgrim with a different gospel. Some were here to cheer for Clara. Others came for blood. Most, if they were honest, just came for the show.

And in the center of it, framed like a reluctant relic, sat Clara Wynn. Her hair was pinned, her dress plain, but there was steel behind her glasses now. She wasn’t confused anymore—she was cataloging everything. She listened to the questions the townsfolk whispered when they thought she couldn’t hear. She saw the way the women paused before hugging her in church, like righteousness might be contagious. And she watched Elijah Crayton at the back of the courtroom, always watching her like a banker watches his ledger.

She did not cry. But she smiled less.

The first day of the trial was more pageant than procedure. The judge, a local farmer with an old law degree and a fear of controversy, tried to keep the noise down but mostly succeeded in breaking his gavel. Reverend Mayfield sat in the front row, nodding gravely and whispering quotes from Leviticus with theatrical gravity. He had become a lightning rod, and he loved it. Three newspapers asked him for interviews. One of them brought a photographer. He wore a new hat.

Drake didn’t attack. Not yet. He asked polite questions. He raised procedural objections with a charming drawl. He let the prosecution crow. Because he saw something no one else saw—not in the testimony, not in the evidence, but in the rhythm of the town. The smiles were a little too wide. The outrage a little too clean. Even the pamphlets were well-designed.

He stood on the porch of the boarding house one night, drinking cold tea and listening to the insects argue. Rosie Hatch—deputy, plainspoken, unflappable—leaned on the rail next to him.

“You’re looking for truth in a theater,” she said.

Drake didn’t turn. “That obvious?”

Rosie nodded toward the courthouse steeple. “I’ve been measuring shadows. They don’t fall where they used to.”

He studied her a moment. “You think this whole thing’s staged?”

She took her time answering. “I think people get mighty creative when they’re scared of going broke. And scared people make good actors.”

“Clara?” he asked.

“She’s real,” Rosie said softly. “The only one in the room who didn’t read the script.”

And the press? They printed everything. Photographs of Clara with headlines like *“Heretic or Hero?”* and *“The Woman Who Said No to Genesis.”* Cartoonists sketched Reverend Mayfield as Moses and Elijah Crayton as Solomon. Hotels were overbooked. Locals were renting out barns. The butcher shop introduced a “Monkey Steak” sandwich, and people lined up to buy it.

Elbow Falls wasn’t on the map anymore. It *was* the map.

And somewhere in the quiet between flashbulbs and fire-and-brimstone, Clara wrote a letter she never sent. It said:

*“I am not brave. I am trapped. And every kind word now feels like the beginning of a bargain.”*

---  

**ACT III: *The Sound Judgment of Men***

Mayor Elijah Crayton believed in three things: Sunday shoes, balanced ledgers, and the superior temperament of Elbow Falls judiciary. He had handpicked Judge Ira McKellan from the county bench three years prior—more for his moderation than his mouth, but the man could quote Cicero *and* Corinthians, and that played well in town. Crayton always said, “A court’s like a levee—it only matters when the storm comes.” And this trial? This was just a summer squall. Manageable. Even profitable.

He was sure of it the way only men with corner offices and quiet fears ever are.

In his walnut-paneled study above City Hall, Crayton met with Reverend Mayfield and Councilman Jasper Rowe. The windows were open, and the heat lay on their shoulders like a wet sermon.

“She’ll be acquitted,” Crayton said, swirling whiskey with one finger. “And we’ll be the town that had the courage to put God on trial—and still let the girl go.”

Jasper looked unconvinced. “You think the Reverend’s congregation will sit easy with that?”

Reverend Mayfield didn’t blink. “God doesn’t need victory. Just the appearance of struggle.”

That was always Mayfield’s game. Stir the waters, let the fish jump, and reap the offering plate. Crayton didn’t begrudge it—he respected the man’s sense of theater. But he thought himself the smarter actor. The judge would hand down an acquittal with a long-winded, sensible ruling full of moral nuance. The papers would print it. The pilgrims would pilgrimage. Elbow Falls would be remembered not as the town that hung the girl, but the one that wrestled with angels and came out honest.

But even as he plotted the parade, the seams were tightening.

Judge McKellan had started waking up in the middle of the night, soaked in sweat and half-certain he’d forgotten how to read. His gavel felt heavier now. During recesses, he stared at the portraits of past judges and imagined them frowning. Once, he thought he heard them whisper.

“I am not a prophet,” he told his wife one night.

She handed him a cup of chicory. “You’re a judge.”

He looked away. “I used to know the difference.”

Drake, meanwhile, had begun laying traps in testimony. He let the prosecution stack hay bales—then lit matches with casual ease. A farmer testified that Clara had mocked the Book of Psalms. Drake read the entire Psalm aloud and asked where the mockery was. The courtroom fell silent. Another witness claimed she’d corrupted the children. Drake produced letters from students quoting Darwin *and* Ecclesiastes in the same breath.

“The girl doesn’t preach,” Drake said coolly. “She listens.”

And still, outside, the banners waved. Motel prices doubled. Souvenir shops sprang up overnight. One sold bobblehead figurines of Clara with a little chalkboard in her hand. The chalk read: *“Think.”*

Crayton watched it all from his office, sipping lemonade and watching the courthouse bell sway in the wind. Tourists parked their sedans on the lawn. Baptists and Unitarians debated on benches. A filmmaker from New York was seen sketching locations. A local woman started a play based on the trial, casting her niece as Clara and her ex-husband as “Oblivious Mayor #2.” Crayton heard about it and chuckled.

“We’re building a legend,” he told Mayfield.

But legends have a way of burning their authors.

During the cross-examination of a star witness—Mrs. Hattie Brixley, devout and deeply loyal—Drake asked if she’d ever heard Clara lie.

“No,” she admitted. “Not even as a child.”

“Then why now?” he asked.

She faltered.

“Do you believe truth comes from the Bible?”

“Yes.”

“Do you believe Clara is speaking the truth?”

She looked down. “I don’t know anymore.”

The room shifted. The truth, once a weapon, became fog.

And Judge McKellan? He broke. Not loudly. Not dramatically. But during a recess, he stayed in chambers too long. When the bailiff knocked, there was no reply. They found him hunched over, muttering Latin and clenching a pocket Bible so tightly the print transferred to his palm.

He resumed the bench the next morning. But he was not the same man.

He banged his gavel before speaking.

“This court will consider,” he said, voice low, “that the pursuit of justice does not mean the absence of confusion. It merely demands the presence of courage.”

Crayton frowned in the gallery.

That was not on the script.

Later that evening, Crayton took the long way home, cutting through the churchyard. He saw Rosie Hatch sitting on the steps of the general store, whittling.

“Something on your mind, Miss Hatch?”

She looked up. “You ever set a fire just to test the water bucket?”

Crayton stiffened. “You think that’s what I’ve done?”

She shrugged. “Depends what you thought the fire would burn.”

And somewhere on the edge of town, Clara walked past the schoolhouse—empty now, its windows boarded. Children had stopped coming. Their parents kept them home “for safety.” She stared at the chalkboard inside and imagined herself erasing every word.

---  

**ACT IV: *The Heat Beneath the Verdict***

The trial was no longer a local matter. It had become *an occasion*.

Outside the courthouse, protest lines turned to pageants. Choirs sang outside motels. A carnival hawker in from Hannibal, Missouri, pitched his tent across from the post office and sold “Trial Fudge” and candied apples stamped with Darwin’s face. One night someone strung a noose from the old elm and hung a scarecrow in a schoolmarm’s dress. That same night, Drake’s hotel room was broken into—nothing stolen, but every page of his legal notes soaked in kerosene. He laughed it off the next day and cross-examined two preachers into rhetorical collapse.

But beneath the applause, the town groaned.

The lumberyard fell behind on orders. The butcher’s boy broke his arm in the crowd and no one noticed until morning. Clara’s father stopped tending his fields altogether and spent his days sitting on the front porch holding a Bible like a ledger with debts no one could pay.

At a late meeting in City Hall, Mayor Crayton sat grim-faced, fingers steepled. Jasper Rowe had come in from the fairgrounds, dust-covered and short of breath.

“They set fire to the Darwin puppet,” Jasper said. “By the Masonic lodge.”

“Expected,” Crayton muttered.

“They did it while the real Darwinists were marching past with signs.”

Crayton looked up.

“Someone threw a bottle. Glass and gasoline.”

No one said anything. A fly tapped against the stained-glass window. Then the Reverend spoke:

“It’s God sorting wheat from chaff.”

But Crayton’s temper flared, sharp and sudden.

“No,” he snapped. “It’s *us* too afraid to admit we built a fire for warmth and found ourselves choking on smoke.”

Mayfield, unbothered, poured himself coffee from the sideboard. “You forget, Elijah. This town has only ever grown in adversity.”

“Yes,” Crayton said bitterly. “And rot spreads best in heat.”

Down at the jailhouse, Clara sat on a cot in her cell, staring at the bars like they might rearrange if she looked long enough. Sheriff Penny brought her a peach wrapped in wax paper. He sat beside the cell, hat in his lap.

“You know what I think?” he said.

She didn’t answer.

“I think they’re gonna let you off. And I think it’ll cost you more than if they didn’t.”

She finally looked up. “Why?”

“Because folk don’t like being made to feel small. And when you walk out of here—head high, clear-eyed—they’ll remember how small you made ’em feel.”

She bit into the peach. It bled down her wrist.

That night, Drake sat alone in the courtroom, sleeves rolled, shirt sweat-soaked, studying the arc of the ceiling. He’d begun to see patterns in the plaster, like maps or concentric ripples in a pond after a stone. He knew this would be his last trial. Whether he won or lost, the rest of his life would be a footnote to this one story. Clara’s name would become a parable, and he, some tired Moses who never got to see the promised land.

The next day, Judge McKellan began instructions to the jury. His voice wavered, heavy with metaphors. He quoted Job, Galileo, and a half-remembered Cherokee parable about two wolves inside every man.

Outside, the courthouse lawn was a festival of noise. Journalists traded rumors. A street preacher stood on a soapbox quoting Revelation while children ate hot corn and played tag around him. Tourists filmed everything. One man tried to sell “Clara rocks” he swore she’d stepped on during recess. They sold out before lunch.

That evening, Drake found Mayor Crayton sitting alone in the town square, shoes dusted, vest unbuttoned.

“You set all this in motion,” Drake said.

Crayton didn’t look at him. “You ever seen a river flood its own banks just because a beaver built the dam too well?”

Drake chuckled. “You thought you’d build a dam and the water’d behave.”

“I thought sound men would steer sound outcomes.”

“They will,” Drake said, quiet. “But the townsfolk? The pilgrims? The fires on both sides? Sound judgment won’t satisfy them.”

Crayton finally looked up. “And what will?”

Drake shrugged. “Maybe nothing. Maybe just the right to keep asking questions.”

And behind them, on the edge of dusk, came the town’s silence. That awful, expectant hush that sometimes precedes a verdict. Or a storm.

---  

**ACT V: *Ashes and Accordions***

The jury filed in just after noon. A dozen faces that once taught schoolchildren or poured coffee, now hollowed by scrutiny, fame, and too many half-heard sermons. The foreman’s hands trembled around the paper.

Clara stood. Not a quiver. Not a twitch. She looked cleaner than any of them. Wore the same plain dress she’d been arrested in. The only difference was the carnation pinned to her collar—left anonymously at the jail that morning.

The judge asked for quiet.

The verdict was read.

**Not guilty.**

Drake exhaled like a dam burst in his lungs. Clara blinked slowly, as if waking from a long sleep. The courthouse didn’t cheer. Not right away. The audience was too stunned. The pilgrims outside had braced for fire and found rain instead. Some cried. Some left. Others screamed betrayal.

The Reverend Mayfield walked out before the judge could dismiss the court.

On the square, the silence cracked like ice. Yells came fast, then scuffles. A scuffle near the candy vendor. A man shoved through the crowd with a painted sign, yelling “SHAME” at the sky. The Darwinist choir got spat on. Someone threw a tuba into the courthouse fountain.

Clara didn’t notice any of it. She only had eyes for her father, who stood at the back of the court and would not meet hers.

Mayor Crayton, meanwhile, waited until the courthouse emptied before stepping into the hall. He loosened his tie and met Drake halfway to the stairs.

“Well?” Crayton asked.

“Well,” Drake said, “you got your verdict. And a tab to match.”

“I thought they’d throw roses.”

Drake gave him a long look. “You set a match to tinder and thought it’d toast marshmallows.”

Outside, the town was fracturing along invisible lines. Hoteliers haggled with departing journalists. The preacher’s daughter stood at the edge of the square, unsure whether to shout or sing. Clara, silent and dignified, walked with Drake down Main Street. A few townsfolk tipped hats. A few turned their backs. One offered her a flower—she took it and said nothing.

By sundown, the streetlamps flickered to life over an uneasy quiet. The town no longer resembled the one from five weeks prior. Too many eyes had come. Too many expectations. And the center could not hold.

In his office, Crayton sat staring at a new ledger. Bookings were down. The carnival was leaving. The fudge man had packed his van.

Jasper entered without knocking.

“Think the tourists’ll come back next spring?” Jasper asked.

“No,” Crayton said. “They’ll chase new heretics by then.”

“What now?”

Crayton poured two drinks. “Now we try to remember how to live here.”

He looked out the window, across Elbow Falls, where the river ran calmer than it had in weeks.

“Or,” he added, “we wait until someone else gives them a reason to come back.”

Back at her home, Clara sat on her stoop, peeling a peach with a penknife. The sheriff passed by and tipped his hat.

“You alright?” he asked.

She nodded.

“What’ll you do now?”

She smiled, just barely. “Keep teaching. Keep listening. Keep peeling peaches until someone else forgets they grow sweet here, not just loud.”

And with that, the story ended—dusk settling over a town too clever for miracles and too proud to admit it was scared all along.

The inspection itself was brief: I just had to give them the key and the registration card, and in 10 minutes, I paid with a card. Yes, they offered me coffee! :)

Preparing for the inspection was not so simple:

- When I was choosing a motorcycle, I avoided those with non-standard mufflers or lights.
- The motorcycle I chose had navigation, a top case (koffer), and LED blinkers installed, which do not affect the inspection.
- I changed the clutch and brake levers, but they didn’t have Allgemeine Betriebserlaubnis (ABE) — I didn’t expect Amazon to sell parts without ABE, so I reverted to the standard ones.
- I installed the Puig windshield myself, and it had ABE.
- I took the bike to the service just before the inspection; they changed the gasket where oil was leaking a little — that could also have been an issue at the inspection.
- The brake pads and tires were fine.
- At the service, they changed all the fluids because the bike hadn't been serviced for a long time.

Actually, I could have passed the inspection at the service. I think coming to TÜV was cheaper, plus I already had an appointment. However, the idea to consult the service regarding passing the inspection wasn’t obvious to me and saved me a lot of time.

The TÜV inspector was very friendly. Maybe there’s a special attitude towards motorcyclists here, or they are just friendly in general. :)

Today we learned that:

Joe doesn't get to pick out his clothes for vacation.

Her paternal grandma is only assembling this pre-fabricated heirloom farmhouse table.

She will not list the WW points (or business name) in her posts about her Pink Mornings Coffee Co beverages.

Kylea wants you to believe she is a snack plate girly like Drue and Dawna.  She mimicked Drue's recent Starbucks Frappuccino Lite post.  

She's taking her ""little sisters"" to get their nails done 04/11, then she and her mom will get their nails done 04/18.  No more images of her ""siblings"" will be shared.  Uh huh, we've heard this before...

Kylea has purchased her weekly ""grocery haul"" and additional grocery store food items out of 3 budgets: her ""grocery,"" ""weekly,"" and ""extras"" budgets. #grift

Overall, her engagement is down and she's panicking.  Her rage bait, sadfishing, Birdie Mae, Forever Proud, and family content no longer bring the boosts they used to...and that's ok!  I love that for her. 🙌

Kendu’s We Don’t Gamble, We Work perfectly encapsulates the drive, determination and unbreakable will power that the community has. Kendu is not about trying to jump from phase to phase, it is about growing sustainably and in a way that is healthy. At Kendu we aren’t looking for a cheeky 10x, we are looking for the tens of billions. This may seem delusional, but I believe with all my heart that Kendu will get there. Shib managed to 1000x in 36 days going from 22 million to 22 billion, if a meme can do that in 2021 with far less money in crypto, imagine what Kendu can achieve. Kendu could reach Shib’s ATH mc with far, far less attention due to there being more money in crypto.  


All Shib and Pepe had was a community, that is all you need to go the top, so it has been proven that community defines the value of a memecoin, so why would you bet against the strongest community in crypto?  


All Shib and Pepe had was a community, that is all you need to go the top.  
  
As AI use increases memes will lose their value, it is no longer a human carefully crafting a meme, it is AI churning out 3000 an hour.

  
**So what will make a coin stand out?**

 

IRL alpha

 

**Why?**

 

Because IRL products/events cannot be faked and this is where Kendu’s strength is unprecedented. From India to Florida Kendu dominates. We have Pickleball in India and we are onto our 3^(rd) Festival in Florida…Yes you read that correctly. Our third festival.  
In this festivals we have given out a few thousand energy drinks(Kendu Energy), merch and made murals(which I will show you below)

Very soon, we our attending the Florida Grove Festival in Orlando and a new mural will be created!!!!!!!!!

Our past Florida events were Miami Art Basel and Miami Music Week!

In India we are hosting glow in the dark Pickleball which is ran by Kendu Entertainment(ran by a chad called Ishan). Pickleball is very popular in India and gets a lot of attention. The Kendu community spirit shines through!

My advice and obviously do your own research is to skip the luxuries for a few weeks, like skip a daily Redbull for a few weeks and put that $30 into Kendu or maybe skip a few Papa Johns.  
If Kendu reaches 10 billion, that $30 will become $30,000. You won’t miss the pizza, but you will heavily regret not investing.

  
I advise everyone to at least join our telegram and hang around a bit, you don’t have to buy a bag, just see if you like our vibe. Any questions are always welcome!!!

We also have a subreddit: r/KenduInu_Ecosystem, but our telegram is way busier.

Another thing you can do is compare our tg activity to other coins, we literally outperform those with 30x the market cap. YES we are that strong  
  
Join the winning team, join Kendu!!!

The riot was over after a week of Daisy hiding and cowering in the corner of her cell. She stood with the gladiators in a line, waiting to get food in the cafeteria. It was a chamber of around one thousand square feet beneath the Colosseum Field with no light except for the torches that adorned the walls. It was large enough to service the gladiators. But not to disperse the numerous foul scents from their bodies, bombarding their noses. The smell of the food would regularly be overwhelmed by the odors of the gladiators’ blood and sweat.

She reached the front of the line, and the server gave her a food tray.

""Thank you,"" Daisy said.

Daisy walked off with her food, but one of the gladiators blocked her path. He signaled her to give him her food, and she quickly complied. As the gladiator left, Daisy dropped into a corner, crying. With no food, no allies, and trapped in a place seemingly made to its finest details to break her physically and mentally, she was nearing the end of her rope. She didn’t even have the strength for another prayer.

However, Everton, eating close by, saw how miserable Daisy was. He tried not to look, but her cries drew him back. Everton labored to dull his compassion, but something about the young woman, alone and in so much pain, moved the heart the man thought died at least a century ago. So, he soon looked at the gladiator, who took Daisy's food and marched over to him with a deep sigh.

""I will say it once. Please give the human back her food,"" Everton said.

""Or what?""

Everton hastily punched the gladiator in the mouth, unconscious. The tray flew from his hands to the ceiling as he fell. But before the food could hit the ground, Everton caught it. Everton strolled over to Daisy with the food in hand, throwing the tray. ""Catch."" And Daisy stopped crying as she grabbed the food barely in time. 

""I thought you said you didn't have any pity left?"" Daisy asked.

""I changed my mind. And if you know what's good for you, you will consume that food before it changes again.""

With Everton's warning, Daisy devoured her food like a wild animal. But quickly, another gladiator approached Everton with a smirk.

""Seems like you've gone soft, Everton. Looking after the new blood, and she's a human too.""

""I don't need to explain myself. Especially not to you.""

""So the mighty warrior has a soft spot. I never thought I would see a Nemesis be like that. Aren't you so-called superior beings supposed to be cruel?""

""Watch your mouth, brat. I'm still tough enough to deal with you like the last time we fought. And the time before that, and the time before that.""

""Old man, I believe things change.""

The gladiator quickly threw a right hand, but Everton effortlessly caught it, tossing him at the far wall. Two more gladiators saw this as an opportunity to strike at Everton with tyloblades. Everton kicked one out, but the other managed to cut across his chest with his blade. However, Everton retaliated, slapping him in the face, knocking his attacker across a table with its plates and cups, as he dropped to his knees, weary from the slash across his chest.

As the gladiators in the room saw Everton weakened, they didn't waste a second, dogpiling him. With all their might, the gladiators beat Everton mercilessly with the accumulated hatred of the Nemesis empire, but Daisy ran to his aid. However, she quickly got swatted aside like a bug as she tried to fight. Still, Everton burst out of the dogpile using all his strength with a mighty roar, sending bodies flying over the room.

Some gladiators quickly rose, preparing to attack Everton again. As they limped to him, Daisy blocked their path, readying to aid Everton with her trembling fist. However, guards entered the room, and as everyone saw them, they lost their fighting spirit, raising their arms in surrender.

""Men, get these animals back in their cages.""

Everton dropped to the floor again, unconscious, and Daisy’s weary eyes locked onto him, unable to look away.

\*\*\*

A few minutes later, Daisy walked with a half-conscious Everton as the guards led him to his cell. The guards tossed him into his bed and tried to drag Daisy back to hers, but she broke loose.

""I won't leave him alone like this.""

One of the guards prepared to attack Daisy, but his comrade stopped him.

""Let her be. It would be a waste if she got injured without someone paying to see.""

The guards left Daisy in Everton's cell, and as they locked the door, she found one of his weapons, a battle axe, lying on the floor. Her hands trembled with the weapon, trying to carry its weight. Hastily, it became too much, forcing her to sit on the dirt floor. She again bemoaned her weakness as she had to cradle the blade in her arms instead of holding it steadfastly in her hands as she stood guard over Everton, seeing gladiators pass by his cell with murderous glares. But Everton soon awakened, seeing his protector.

""W-what are you doing?"" Everton asked.

“Mr. Nemesis?” Daisy turned her head away from her vigil to Everton.""I-I figured someone needed to stand guard while you rested.""

""Child, you should know kindness like yours is a blessing for others but a curse to yourself.""

Daisy smiled.""I can't help it. Pa did too good with us.""

""Look, I don't need a nurse or a protector. Just hand me that water bottle on the shelf.""

Everton pointed to a bottle on his shelf, and Daisy hurried over to it. As she reached the bottle, she spotted a sewing kit with a small torn-up cushion in it. But she quickly grabbed the bottle and handed it over to Everton.

""Mr. Nemesis-""

""My name is Everton Blak,"" Everton interrupted.

""Okay, Everton-""

Everton fell asleep as he took one drink of his water. And as Daisy saw this, she looked at the shelf where the cushion was. Later, Everton awakened and saw Daisy working in a corner.

""Child, what are you doing over there?""

""You're awake.” Daisy looked closely at Everton’s chest. ”And that big cut on your chest closed up already.""

""I asked a question.""

""Oh, sorry, I was fixing that cute little pillow you had on your shelf.""

*""What?""* Everton shouted.

Everton hurried over to Daisy and grabbed the cushion out of her hand, seething. However, seeing she fully repaired it, he calmed, shedding tears.

“I hope I don’t sound rude, but may I ask-“

""The cushion and the sewing kit were gifts from my wife to my daughter. They were the only things I was able to grab before the empire threw me in here before they killed my child Evelyn.""

""They can be that cruel even to their own?” Daisy’s jaw dropped, her hands covering her mouth. “Everton, I am so sorry for touching those without permission. It's not the same. But I know what it’s like to lose someone.""

""You do?""

""The worst day of my life. When My Pa died in an accident on our farm when I was six.""

With a deep breath, Everton kindly rubbed the top of Daisy's head, making her blush with embarrassment. 

""You're in luck, child. I've decided to help.""

""H-help how?""

""I'll teach you all I know about combat. The knowledge will be invaluable the next time my colleagues become lively. Or when they inevitably ask you to fight in a match.""

""Thank you, but one thing. Please don't expect me to kill anyone while I'm here.""

""Then please don't expect to live a long life."" Everton removed his hand from Daisy’s head.

""I'm serious.” Daisy stomped her foot. “I won’t take the gift of life from someone in this sick game.""

""Fine, I'll do my best regardless.” Everton looked at Daisy perplexed. ”What’s your name, girl?”

""Daisy David.” Daisy initiated a pinky promise.

“What are you doing?”

“It’s a human custom. Holding each other’s pinky fingers is a way of making deals official.”

“Seems somewhat moronic to me.”

Again, Daisy initiated a pinky promise, and as Everton saw it, he released a groan but joined in to seal the deal.

\*\*\*

Daisy and Everton walked down a long dark tunnel, heading towards the brilliant light at the end. The heat hit Daisy’s face like an invisible fist as they exited the tunnel. Leaving the dark, claustrophobic chambers of the Colosseum for the first time in days, Daisy’s eyes needed a few seconds to readjust to the light. But finally, she did, gazing at the Colosseum field in all its glory. 

It was a massive circular pit that she estimated must have been thousands of feet in diameter, perhaps more. The ground was a sand-like substance that her farmer’s blood immediately assumed must be some variation of sandy soil. And above them was seating for thousands, millions of potential spectators.

“This is where you're going to train me, Everton?”

“No, child. Over there.” Everton pointed off into the distance.

Daisy followed Everton’s direction, spotting a weapon’s pile. “Okay.” As the two briskly walked over to it.

“Please choose one you prefer.”

“Yes sir, thank you.”

Amongst the pile were several different types of weaponry. Daisy’s eyes scanned through various swords, spears, Tyloblades, and more. She saw numerous weapons she could carry, unlike Everton’s battle axe. But none felt right. However, soon, her eyes fixed on one as if it was calling to her, asking her to be its master. It was a circular, metallic shield.

“This one, Everton.” Daisy took the shield from the pile.

“Are you sure, child?”

“One hundred percent.”

Everton exhaled heavily. “Very well then. Let’s begin basics.”

Daisy raised her hand to ask a question.

“Feel free to use your words, girl.”

“Yes, sir. Could you please show me how the ice trick works?”

“Ice trick?”

“You know when you summon ice and cold from the palm of your hand.”

Everton rubbed his chin. “Who did you say your mistress was again?”

“Morana Blight.”

“That explains it. Truth be told, I have no idea how the ice witch does that. It shouldn’t be possible with her Kai.”

“Kai?”

“Oh, yes.” Everton picked up a large rock. “You humans wouldn’t know this, but Kai is a mystical energy field unique to our galaxy.”

Daisy looked around frantically. “Is it around us right now?”

“It’s around everyone all the time.” Everton crushed the rock to pieces. “You should know there are those who can draw the energy within themselves, creating significant physical enhancement or supernatural phenomena like Morana’s ice.”

“So anyone can do it?”

“Theoretically, yes. But it’s easier for some species than others. You see, there's a genetic component. We Nemesis should only be capable of strength and speed enhancement.”

“But where did Kai come from? I mean, why is it only in our galaxy?”

“No one knows for sure. It was discovered long before my time. And I’m over nine hundred of your human years old.”

Daisy placed her hand over her eyes, clutching her face tightly.

“But you shouldn’t fret about it.”

“I shouldn’t?”

“Yes. Basic training starting now.”

\*\*\*

Later, Everton began Daisy’s training. He guided her to the center of the field, where the sun was hottest as its rays bombarded the land most directly, overseeing her stretching exercises.

Daisy bent her back as far as it could go. ”Done. Now what?”

“Now, the real training. We’ll start with basic strength exercises and gradually increase the difficulty.”

“Martial arts?”

“Only when I deem you ready.”

Daisy breathed in sharply. ”Yes, sir.”

“Now, get down. I want five pushups on your knuckles.”

Daisy swiftly complied with Everton’s order. She got down on the ground, placing her hands firmly into the sandy soil at shoulder length apart, clenching them into fists. But as she bent her knees to touch the ground, going for her first push-up, Everton cleared his throat to get her attention.

“Yes, Everton?”

“Extend your legs out, girl.”

“Oh, sorry. Force of habit.”

Daisy corrected her position, extending her legs so they wouldn’t touch the ground. Immediately, she felt the difference. Her heart rate increased drastically, her breathing intensified, and sweat flooded her face. The full weight of her admittedly skinny body fell upon her arms. It demanded immense effort to complete two push-ups. The sun’s heat and the loose particles of the soil exasperated her difficulty in staying up. Finally, exhausting her strength, she let go, hitting the ground.

*“What was that?”* Everton shouted.

“I’m so sorry, Everton.”

“I made the exercise as simple as it could be.”

Daisy rested her head on the ground, covering her face with her hands. “I know.”

“Just get up and try again.”

“No. I’m sorry, but combat training was a mistake.”

“What?”

“I’m weak. I could never be a warrior.”

Everton pulled Daisy off the ground, forcing her to stand.

“So you’ll go out of your way to protect everyone but yourself.” Everton forcibly poked Daisy on the forehead. “How does your mind work, child?”

*“It’s not my fault I’m weak.”* Daisy shed tears.

“Is that so? I know those who have never touched a weapon before Mavor’s war. Many of them hailed from worlds that hadn’t seen conflict in centuries. And they had to defend themselves and those they cared for. So please tell me, what is your excuse?”

“Those they cared for?”

Everton’s words echoed through Daisy’s mind. Again, the faces of those she loved flashed across her thoughts, ending on Carter. She remembered what he said about her inner strength. She wondered if she could call upon it to aid her training. Perhaps now was the time to let her fears go and trust the word of the man she loved. If it was true, there was still hope for her to reunite with him and her family. She had to try, had to believe in hope. It was one of the many lessons Joseph instilled in his daughter.

“Okay. I’ll try again.”

Daisy got back down and again struggled to do her push-ups, but slowly, she crossed the line from two to three push-ups with every nerve riling in pain.

The next day, in the blazing sun, Daisy did more push-ups on the Colosseum field under Everton's supervision. He instructed her to complete ten. But she struggled still as each took a herculean effort in the searing heat. However, as Daisy dropped to the ground, exhausted, Everton's cold stare forced her to start again. And she let out a scream of both motivation and excruciating pain.

Daisy ran around the Colosseum field with Everton through bitter cold and snow a month later. This time, the exercise was to enhance stamina and endurance. But as she ran with Everton, like on Earth, the cold air pained her lungs more and more, and she collapsed. As Everton noticed this, his eyes locked onto her unmoving body, but running to aid her, she struggled back to her feet. Daisy started running again. ”Not this time.” turning his fear into pride.

The months raced by increasingly faster as Everton intensified Daisy’s training. He gradually added more to her routine of strength and endurance exercises. But finally, he deemed her ready for martial arts. In the blazing sun, Daisy stood with Everton. She swiftly performed fighting techniques one after another in the searing heat. As she finished her demonstration, Everton kindly rubbed the top of her head. No longer a weak civilian, but a warrior, at last.

\*\*\*

Spectators filled the Colosseum as the sky downpoured a tsunami the next day. On the field, Everton stood with Daisy as she chose a circular shield from the weapons pile.

""Remember your basics, child.""

""I will, teacher.""

“Truth be told, I had hoped to refine your training a bit more, but it appears time was against us.”

“I’ll use everything you taught me to the fullest.”

“You did learn far quicker than I expected.” Everton kindly rubbed Daisy’s head. “Despite all your moaning about your weakness, you merely lacked discipline and the motivation of certain death, of course.”

Daisy giggled, hugging Everton goodbye, and hurried to face her opponent. But as Daisy left, he grew a worried expression, wondering if he prepared her enough.

Soon, Daisy stood to face her opponent, a muscular grey alien, in the heavy rain. The crowd went dead silent, seeing the competitors ready for combat. But as a referee signaled to start, the roars began a new as the gladiator struck first.

Shield met blades in a battle at blurring speed. The gladiator struck with his Tyloblades with increasing fury. As they cut through the air, Daisy blocked each with her shield, alternating from her head and body, matching his bloodlust with the will to survive. An attack broke past her defenses, cutting her side. However, Daisy headbutted him back.

The young woman rushed to retaliate, readying to bash her opponent with her shield. As she got close, he grabbed her arm, tossing her aside and taking her weapon. The gladiator threw it away from Daisy and charged at her for the kill.

*""Make haste, child. Remember the close-quarters technique I taught you,""* Everton shouted.

Daisy heard Everton as the gladiator pounced on her with his blades. She danced around his strikes as gracefully as a ballerina, narrowly dodging several fatal blows. She broke through his defenses, kicking him in the face. Daisy swiftly sprinted for her shield on the ground. And getting it as the gladiator tossed one of his blades at her, deflecting it.

Daisy again ran towards her opponent. He retaliated, trying to slash her with his remaining blade. However, she ducked under the attack, punching him in the stomach. With her opponent disoriented, Daisy unleashed a storm of blows to his face and body. Finally, with a mighty scream, she landed one final punch in his face, sending him crashing down. 

The spectators went wild seeing her victory. But Everton instead dropped to the ground with immense relief.",1,1744370057.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Wealthy women who marry, have a child, then immediately divorce?","I’m not sure if it’s a trend or just anecdotal, but I keep hearing stories—mine included—where wealthy women marry, have a child, and then almost immediately file for divorce. They get the wedding, the showers, the baby… and then, suddenly, they’re out.

My STBX left and kidnapped our daughter three months after she was born. No fight. No explanation. No conversation. No ultimatum. Just lawyers, accusations, and a coordinated attempt to destroy my reputation.

I survived false allegations, supervised visits, and months of emotional abuse. I was accused of being mentally unstable because I took our daughter on long walks and drank coffee inconsistently—apparently, that made me a threat. In reality, I was a brand-new parent doing everything I could to give my wife a break. I once picked up dinner for her and was told that meant I didn’t want to spend time with our baby. At the time, I was working full-time, doing all the housework, and still being accused of neglect.

Meanwhile, she was going to mommy-daughter workout classes, posting photos of her new “baby coworker” on Instagram, and networking in mom playgroups. It all felt so materialistic. I started to feel like our daughter was just a means to an end.

If there’s one moment that really shows how absurd this situation became, it was her first Mother’s Day. She didn’t spend it with her family—she was in Connecticut throwing up in a parking lot after too many margaritas at a wedding. I, on the other hand, was home taking care of our 3-month-old daughter by myself for four days. When she got back, she called me a horrible husband for not picking her up from the airport at 2 a.m.

She failed to alienate me from our daughter, and I remind myself daily: this doesn’t age well for her. But I can’t shake the feeling—was I just used? Was I a vessel for the lifestyle, the baby, and now the image of being a “single mom” (with a full-time nanny, of course)?

All communication has gone through attorneys. We were married for only 1.5 years, and this divorce has already cost me my job, $1.2M in stock, and legal fees over $200K. And the kicker? It all could’ve been resolved with one honest conversation a year ago. She still refuses to speak directly.

The insanity continues. She’s now asking to be compensated for half a bottle of champagne that was gifted to us for our engagement. The twist? She took it from our apartment and drank the whole thing herself.

I’m starting to believe marriage today is not what it was for our parents. It feels like a joke now and divorce and false allegations are way too easy.

I honestly can’t make this crap up and I wish it wasn’t so, but on the bright side I’ve got my baby girl who’s absolutely crushing it on walking and will undoubtedly see through the bullshit that my ex will try and fabricate.

I promise, the backstory is important. This is a long one so get some popcorn.

I met her 9 years ago and it was quite literally love at first sight. Like honestly I just loved everything about her - her laugh, her smile. Everything. To me she was perfect. And I was lucky because she felt the same way about me (I had no idea of course).

Every day over the course of 2 years I fell harder and harder, but she ended up moving on. We were really really close friends. One of her friends told me she liked me while she was also there, but (me being young and stupid) just laughed it off and pretended like it was nothing.

But it wasn’t nothing. I went to bed and she haunted me dreams, I just couldn’t get her out of my head. Eventually though, I think I accepted somewhat that we were just going to be friends and it wasn’t worth me perusing anything more. I never lost feeling though. They never left.

We were really close friends for the next year (year 4 of our friendship now) and then I ended up moving school. This meant we didn’t see each other much for year 4 and 5. Then she moved to my school, and that was that. She was back in my life again as if nothing had changed.

Over the next 2 years, we didn’t talk much however. She was looking to find her own place at the school and I was trying to develop as a person, learn more about myself etc..

But in the 7th year, we started travelling together and talking more. I became friends with her new friends, and we got pretty close again. 

We stayed close for a while, until now. Half way through year 9. We hit 10 years in 6 months.

I caught feeling for her all over again. And I confessed (or so I thought). I asked her to be my valentine this year, which she said yes too. I was honestly ecstatic. I couldn’t believe it. I was playing badminton that night with my best friend and I couldn’t play half the time bc my knees were shaking so bad, and he was just laughing at my (I love my bro 😭). Anyways - I sent her a little text like “it wasn’t long, but happy valentines!!” And I assumed she’d text me back like “yeah lol, glad we did this” or SOMETHING idk. 

What I didn’t expect was to be left on delivered for a week. And then I saw her in person and she didn’t even want to talk to me. Like she was just so so cold. And then I tried making conversation, she put in her headphones. We got off the underground, she walks in the opposite direction and doesn’t say goodbye (she basically ran away). And then I text her like “are we still friends? I’m sorry if I made it awkward..” and she just goes “why wouldn’t we be” like wtf?? And anyways, after that I end up deleting the text (this is now 12 day later or smth). 

But the real kicker is what happens after.

She stays cold for a bit, and then all of a sudden BAM!!

She’s asking me to play badminton with her, downloading apps I’ve been recommended, stalking my music listening, sending me song recommendations, texting me all day, asking to join me at a concert I mentioned and then going with me. 

One of the songs she recommended was a song about a person not texting back and the other person getting mad, and how the person that didn’t text back made a mistake and regrets it.

sounds like a pretty intentional choice icl..

And now she’s gone from being this super cold person to texting me back in seconds and trying to make plans.

So I asked if she wanted to get coffee with me, which she said yes to. I had a whole plan where we could walk there and I’d get her coffee and we could sit in the library (we both like going to the library to chill) and then I’d ask her to be my girlfriend and all would be well.

And then she cancelled, and rescheduled for a day later. Fair enough, something came up (her reason was very valid). 

Then, on the day we were meant to go, she says “can I bring my bsf” (also f btw). I tell her sure if she wants, and then she says “it’s fine I won’t invite her”. Not one hour later and she cancels again bc of another (fairly valid) reason.

I don’t care about the cancellation, but what I do care about is that she took time that I’d made for us, and then made it a group hangout session. Like the fact that she even asked that.

At this point I don’t even know if she likes me.. I mean she’s giving some of the most mixed signals possible. Hell, almost every time we talk she brings the conversation to like, if I’ve dated anyone before and who (never dated :(…  ) and ex’s and love or how good it would be to have a caring partner or stuff like that.

I’m kind of at the point where I just want to confess to get it off my mind, I know that’s a little selfish though. What do you people think? Hoping anyone can give me advice (I’m so close to breaking down with all of this and other stuff on my mind rn..).

Please help. Like from all of this even, do you think she like me?? I’m so confused about all of this.

Thanks, sorry for the long post..

This exam is not a test. It’s a personality-altering black hole masquerading as a syllabus. You open the door thinking it’s just Polity and History, and next thing you know, you’re debating climate treaties at 3 AM, questioning the morality of wars, and crying because you forgot the difference between Article 32 and 226 again.

I used to have hobbies. Now I collect PDFs. My idea of “leisure” is scrolling through toppers’ answer sheets like I’m decoding ancient scripture. I’ve read so many strategy posts, I can now predict the exact moment someone will say “Revise multiple times and stay consistent” like it’s a sacred chant.

There’s also this strange, almost karmic relationship you develop with your optional. At first, it’s love at first sight. Intellectual stimulation. Sparks flying. And then one day, it ghosts you mid-paper, shows up in the weirdest case study format, and you're left staring at the question like it just said, “It’s not you, it’s me.”

UPSC doesn’t teach you Psychology. It becomes your therapist, gaslighter, and life coach, all rolled into one emotionally unavailable exam.
Not a syllabus, but a five stage emotional hostage situation:
Denial — thinking one reading of Laxmikant will spiritually align your chakras and secure your prelims.
Delusion — the confident hallucination that this is the year, despite zero mocks and a bookshelf of guilt.
Bargaining — “If I finish three subjects today, I’ll totally deserve two hours of guilt-free memes.”
Depression — where your dreams, your notes, and your will to live start blurring together.
Acceptance — not of results, just of the absurdity. You no longer fight the chaos. You marry it.

Mock tests? Oh, they’re just red flags dressed as self-improvement. Nothing bruises your soul quite like scoring 52 out of 200 on a test you thought you aced. You stare at the OMR sheet like it cheated on you. And yet, like that toxic ex who left you crying and caffeinated at 2 AM, you keep going back. Because UPSC doesn’t block you. It breadcrumb texts you with hope and ghost marksheets.

And yet, in the strangest way, we romanticize it. We stay. Not because it’s kind, but because it promises a future ... one where maybe, just maybe, it loves us back with an interview call.

So if you're out there too, coffee in one hand, Spectrum in the other, whispering sweet nothings to a mountain of notes...
Good luck, comrade. Maybe we’ll meet someday ....in the corridors of North Block. Or a group therapy session.

Is it ok if I lock my cat up at night?

Hey everyone,

We rescued our cat over a month ago and we have been loving him but he wakes me up 5:30 every morning to eat, I normally let him meow until 6 and then feed him once my alarm goes off. He has started within the last few days waking me up even earlier, some times at 3 am, 4:30, and 5. He doesn’t even bother my boyfriend, probably because I feed him but if neither of us get up to him meowing, he crawls over me and purrs in my face which is sweet but not at 4:30 am, especially when I went to bed at midnight.

He does this to eat and we are currently switching his litter over which I think is part of the problem ( clay to pellets bc it’s cheaper and less chemicals) but I am losing my patience and am so run down. My boyfriend will feed him too but he just doesn’t crawl all over him or meow in his face, only mine.

I’m loving the bond I have w him so far but I am just wondering if it would be awful of me to make him sleep in the (very large) bathroom his litter box is in? There are built in shelves he will lay in and I of course will bring his food and water but I am honestly suffering.

I’m hoping once we can afford an automatic kibble dispenser that will help the issue, but I’m honestly not sure because he loves the routine of waking me up, wet food and dry given to him, we play and I make coffee lol.

Also- if I go BACK to bed after feeding him he also meows non stop because he wants me to play. This is one of the reasons I think that the automatic food dispenser will cut it for his morning routine.

Should I change the routine we currently have set, if so, how?

_______________________________________UPDATE_________________________________

We have stopped leaving out the wand toys and all of the other dangerous ones.

Throughout this week we have been sure to give him lots of playtime throughout the day, and especially right before bedtime. He has had open access to his kibble, a water fountain and other water bowls. We keep out ping pong balls, Pom Pom’s and his door hanging toys that he can play with anytime along with one automatic toy. My boyfriend has been sleeping with the door closed (I’m not home) but left the door open last night and he said that Cheetos behavior is getting worse and he is meowing extremely loudly at 3am (so it’s getting earlier). 
I understand a change in routine can worsen behavior but we are in an apartment with a family with young kids living directly above us and are worried they are hearing him hollering in the middle of the night. 

We are at a loss of what to do and beyond frustrated. We have literally left the ENTIRE apartment open to him and he just wants attention at the worst time. 

Side note: he is a biter too, doesn’t matter if you’ve given him plenty of attention or none at all, he will bite. Bro hard enough to break skin but it’s not always a love bite or setting boundaries bite. He’s literally nipped my leg when I’m going to the bathroom?? ( and I dont mean oh he bites every now and then) like it is 3-5 times per day individually for my boyfriend and I. We try to control our reactions and have been better at not punishing him because that apparently encourages it but I swear he thinks it’s a game and we DO NOT play with our hands. 

We are still giving him time to adjust but are so frustrated with him. 

If anyone has advice OTHER THAN feeding him more or playing more or getting another cat please let me know. Financially we cannot afford a second cat and honestly with the introduction period and being in an apartment we don’t have the space or time to dedicate to that properly. 

As of this morning, Cheeto didn’t stop meowing even when my boyfriend was awake and on the couch. He turned on his automatic toy and the tv and he still didn’t stop. 

QUESTION:

We ARE free feeding right now, i think it has made him more unpredictable and he is constantly trying to ""bury"" his food. we are going to get an automatic feeder BUT 

What times are the best to have the feeder dispense food?
im thinking 7am, 5 pm, 10pm?

i would like to have one around bed time which tends to be 10 for us (unless i am up late for school work). 

please let me know. i am currently looking into what Jackson Galaxy says and recommends and am going to try that route. Hopefully if we stay consistent with it that should help. ",2,1744368416.0,CatTraining,23,0.75,False

I am fairly healthy. I am 33. I do not drink anymore. I stopped on News Years (my SA was beginning of April). I do drink 3-5 cups of coffee a day. They did not recommend clomid due to my testosterone being good (didnt say I cant take it and would write up a prescription) If I wanted too as they did not think it would help that much if at all. I do have epilepsy and on seizure meds. No one can 100% determine if my meds are the cause as there is a lack of medical knowledge. I 100% cannot stop taking it to see any difference nor want to attempt to adjust them/try different meds as I have a regimen that works well and afraid any change will cause me to have seizures. My dosages are high for the meds I take. They recommended IVF. 

My wife had fertility testing done and she is 100% normal. I feel bad for her. She is afraid of medical procedures and is afraid of the IVF process and that it entails for her. Should we go straight into IVF or should I alteast try clomid and coQ10 and a healthier diet first with a substantial decrease in caffeine or should we jump to IVF? we have been trying for 1.5 years now with no luck. She is only 30 but I feel stuck. We are fortunate enough to have health insurance that covers IVF at 80% of the total cost with unlimited number of rounds.

No it's not just in my head. This reminds me of when I went to the Rotterdam port days with my mother, and we were standing at a fence when some blonde lady next to us kept pushing closer to me as if she was trying to steal my spot.

I know it's not in my head, because later my mother recalled how that was so rude of her. And this is just one of many times that this has happened.

It's kind of annoying at this point, I'll just be feeling myself and people will call me arrogant, I had that in the metro lately. I was just sitting with my bag on the other seat next to me. Some lady comes in and talks to her friends who are already seated. The metro is not even close to full yet.

Instead of asking me to move my bag politely, she states that she can't sit ""because this guy is arrogant"" or something along those lines. She then proceeds to SIT ON MY BAG a couple of seconds later. Like how rude can you be, JUST ASK ME TO MOVE MY BAG AND I WOULD'VE DONE IT.

I have decent muscle but the fat on my abdomen and love handles completely kills my will to look at myself unclothed. 
I have been active till 11th. Mid-fielder in Football and ran almost all throughout the day. I gained a lot of weight when I joined IIT prep and never lost it. 

Lockdown had an impact as well.

I started the keto/carnivore diet with one meal a day and I got to 73kgs. But then OMAD is not really sustainable because you have to keep reminding yourself that you're gonna get the food eventually. Once you loose this mental battle you gain every kilo back.

I want to make healthy and sustainable lifestyle changes to finally get rid of this SHITE covering my body (crazy body image issues, i hate to even look at myself).

I am genuinely trying but cant figure out what is it that I am doing wrong or missing?

I try to walk 10k steps.
I either go for a walk/run/HIIT in the morning.
Take all my calls while walking.
Go to the gym in the evening.
Cook all my food by myself.
Measure what I am eating and how much I am eating. 

My DIET:

Coffee with milk and sugar - 200gm milk + 1tsp sugar

Homemade Curd - 150gm

4 egg whites boiled
2 whole egg omelette with a cheese slice 
1 scoop whey protein
150gm white rice + 100gm whatever dal
or sabzi there is

50gm - Roasted Chana

50gm Dry Soya Chunks (which I then fry in an air fryer)
1 Scoop Whey Protein
150gms rice + whatever there is to eat

Cronometer and HealthifyMe say that it all accounts to 1700ish kcal.

My TDEE is - 2100kcal.

Apple Health says I burn around 200kcal.

I genuinely need help to shred off every inch of fat. I am willing to make changes to what I eat and how I eat.

Please don't roast me but share genuine advices. (Im all good with jokes but the body image issues have really started to take a toll on my mental health)

I dont want quick results 
I am willing to wait it out.

I thought my diet is correct but then today when I stood on the machine it went to 86-87 and then came back at 85.90

This really frustrates as to WHY IS IT SO DAMN HARD FOR MY BODY TO LOOSE THE WEIGHT

1jwmmio,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1jwmmio/i_kept_missing_posts_from_my_favorite_instagram/,"I kept missing posts from my favorite Instagram profiles, so I built a daily email digest with AI summaries","Hi everyone! I want to share a side project I just launched called Dailygram, born from a frustration I had. I love following certain Instagram accounts (for inspiration and news), but I kept missing important posts due to the algorithm and my busy schedule. I’d often think, *“Did I miss something cool from natgeo or my favorite creator this week?”*

So I decided to solve that pain for myself. Dailygram is a tool that sends you a daily email digest of posts from specific Instagram profiles *you* choose, with short AI-generated summaries for each post. Essentially, it’s like getting a personalized mini-newsletter every day for Instagram content, so you can stay updated without constantly checking the app or worrying about the feed algorithm.

How it works: Every day, Dailygram gathers any new posts from the IG accounts you’ve selected. It uses GPT-4o to generate a 2-3 sentence summary of each post (in plain text, no ads or distractions). Then it emails you everything in one go. *Example:* I follow NatGeo and Bill Gates, each morning I get an email that neatly summarizes their latest posts (topics, insights, etc.), with a link in case I want to view the full post. It’s like a quick briefing of just the stuff I care about.

Some key points:

* You can add any public IG profile (personal or business) that you don’t want to miss updates from.
* The email digest is once daily (you set the time) or weekly, so it won’t spam you. It’s meant to be a quick read over coffee.
* The AI summaries help capture the gist if a post has a long caption or article. If there are multiple posts, it gives an overview of each.
* It’s *privacy-friendly,* no need to login with your IG account. Just enter the profile names on Dailygram and your email. (The tool uses Instagram’s public info to fetch posts)
* Who might find this useful? Marketers tracking competitors’ IG updates, creatives following inspiring artists, or anyone trying to reduce mindless scrolling but still stay informed. (Personally, I’ve cut down my Instagram screen time a lot thanks to this.) I’m still trying to find a niche for this. I know that’s something I should have done earlier, but as I said, I built it for myself. Then my friends started using it, and eventually my colleagues too… so here we are.

I built Dailygram to scratch my own itch, but I’m hoping it can help others who face the same problem of lost Instagram content or social media FOMO. Right now it’s free to use, I’m just looking for feedback and to see if it genuinely provides value.

You can check it out at [https://dailygram.me](https://dailygram.me)   
I really put my heart into the landing page to make it clearer and more visually appealing, so it better shows what the tool does.

I suggested that he stop drinking coffee to see what would happen. Since he stopped, his mood has improved. I could see that he stood up without complaining about pain or nerves, and he even started taking naps in the afternoons. When he sleeps at night, it is a continuous dream, without interruptions.

I am not a doctor but I think that coffee is not very good for people with lupus, I think that people with lupus need to be calm, sleep well and coffee increases cortisol which increases stress, nerves, anxiety, and reduces melealima which is the sleep hormone.

My sister, who is a doctor, tells me to stop pretending that she is the doctor and that my mother should continue drinking coffee. I believe that to see the difference between a life with or without coffee and its benefits, I do not need to be a doctor.

I told mom that instead of drinking coffee I should replace it with turmeric, chamomile, or cold oatmeal tea.
