I'm hoping to tap into the power of lawbitcheswithtaste because frankly, the dating apps are soul-crushing and I know you all must have some amazing single friends. I'm in my early 20s and I'm looking for someone genuine, kind, and interested in an actual relationship - not situationships or hookups. Basically, someone who has their life figured out enough to be dating intentionally, but not so figured out that they can't have fun. Located in NYC area, of course!


Why law friends? Because I trust your judgment, you probably have cool friends with actual careers, and you understand the NYC dating struggle. Plus, you're basically professional vetters, right? 

If you have any friends who might be a good match, I'd love to connect! Happy to share more details about myself in DMs, and I promise to make it worth your while with quality coffee/wine/entertaining dating horror 
stories.

P.S. If you're also looking to escape the apps, feel free to comment below - maybe we can be friends and help each other out!

1grb2v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1grb2v2/my_bf_26m_put_his_hands_on_me_19f_this_morning/,My BF (26m) put his hands on me (19f) this morning. Can you guys give me advice?,"This morning, my bf (26M) and I (19F), woke up so peacefully, had sex, and went into the kitchen to make some coffee and breakfast before I went to my classes. We were talking while the coffee was brewing and then he starts shadow boxing me. (He boxes and was pretending to punch me) while I was standing there asking him over and over again to please stop doing that because I don‚Äôt like any form or representation of domestic violence. I have a hard boundary about anything close to or representing domestic violence wether it be verbal or physical. Anyways, he was shadow boxing me and I asked him 4 times nicely to please stop doing that and that I don‚Äôt like that or put up with that kind of thing, the fifth time I told him I‚Äôm dead serious and he better stop now. It was almost as if he was deaf to my requests, and whole time I never even raised my voice to him. He continued to shadow box me after I told him I was dead serious about it and when he didn‚Äôt stop that fifth time, I took a glass full of water and doused him with the whole thing in his face. Then I stormed off to his room. 

He then came to the room and told me that I needed to clean up that mess. I told him it‚Äôs not my mess to clean up and that it‚Äôs just the consequences of his actions of not listening to me the first 4 times I asked him to stop. Eventually, I got up from the bed I was sitting on, mind you the mattress is all the way on the floor, I get up and he shoved me hard as hell back on the bed in an aggressive way. I get up again and he does the same thing again. Then I tell him he ruined the date I had planned for later today and that I‚Äôm leaving. Then he takes my bag of clothes and hides it across the house. I go to the kitchen looking for my bag and this whole time we‚Äôre screaming at eachother. Then he shoves me again and screams at me to get the fuck out of his life. I go to leave his house and he won‚Äôt let me leave, and he‚Äôs holding my property hostage. Eventually I get out of the house and get into my car but he then brings my bag back but takes my phone to get me to come back inside. I take his glasses off his face so he gives me my phone back, and he damn near smashes my phone on the floor. Eventually he brings my phone and he gets his phone and glasses from my car and is trying to talk with me and reason with me.

It‚Äôs difficult because this is a dealbreaker to me. I always vowed that if a man ever put his hands on me that I‚Äôm leaving the first time and not sticking around for a next time because if I stay they‚Äôre gonna think it‚Äôs okay. His behavior was extremely erratic and toxic and almost scary because he‚Äôs a boxer and could seriously hurt me if he wanted to. In general he‚Äôs the sweetest person but he sometimes has these episodes of acting crazy and neurotic. We‚Äôre already going through things in our relationship and I just don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs good for me. Especially now that he put his hands on me, I can‚Äôt, out of respect for myself, tolerate that and return to him. I started crying in the car and told him that now I‚Äôm gonna be scared of him, which he would hate for that to happen, but thats what happens when you put your hands on a female. That‚Äôs a big no no and  a subsequent deal breaker. I know I deserve so much better, I just don‚Äôt know if this is stuff that every couple goes through and if it‚Äôs somewhat normal in healthy relationships. Would it be healthy to leave or stay?

TLDR: My boyfriend disregards my requests for him to stop shadow boxing my face and he doesn‚Äôt listen so I splash a cup of water on him. We get into an altercation where he shoves me 3 times and and holds my property hostage and doesn‚Äôt let me leave his house. I eventually leave and I don‚Äôt know whether I should leave him or try and work it out in our relationship.

I just uploaded a first version of my Simhub Moza plugin. Based on the current game or game/car combination it automatically sets the wheel base config. Some things are still missing (e.g. some detailed documentation, tool tips etc.) or not working (e.g. in Moza's SDK/API such as the 100hz equalizer setting) but most of the parts are fully functional. You still need to install Pit House of course.   
Also I plan to integrate RPM LED settings, but this is totally broken currently in their API. Let's see when it will be fixed.

1gras36,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gras36/thinking_on_purchase_a_gaggia_classic_evo_pro_600/,Thinking on purchase a Gaggia Classic Evo Pro [$600],"Hey everyone,

I hope you‚Äôre having a great day wherever you are! I have a question to share. I currently own a Delonghi Dedica Style espresso machine, and I‚Äôm considering upgrading to a brand new Gaggia Classic Evo Pro. My decision to upgrade isn‚Äôt due to any disappointment with my Delonghi; rather, I‚Äôm always looking to improve and elevate my coffee game.

I primarily use my machine to make lattes, as I‚Äôm working on enhancing my latte art skills. I‚Äôve also had the opportunity to try machines like EDMs and a few Brevilles, but unfortunately, those aren‚Äôt available in my country (Chile) since we use 220V for electricity and the market offering is not as big as other countries.

In terms of upgrades, I haven‚Äôt changed much on my machine‚ÄîI‚Äôve just removed the capsule that goes over the steamer and invested in a better tamper.

**Aspects I like about my Delonghi and would like to maintain in a new machine:**

1. **Fast Heating:**¬†I want a machine that is ready to use in less than 5 minutes. EDM takes 30 minutes to warm up, which is unacceptable for me.
2. **Ease of Use:**¬†I find machines with manual indicators to be complicated. While I appreciate their aesthetics, they are not practical for me.
3. **Easy Maintenance:**¬†Delonghi machines are very easy to maintain. I receive a yellow signal from the machine indicating when maintenance is needed.
4. **Lattes Made Easy:**¬†I can make my morning latte without running late for work.
5. **Compact Size:**¬†I have a small kitchen, so I appreciate a slim design.

**Aspects I don‚Äôt like about my Delonghi and would like to improve with a new machine**

1. **Cheap Materials:**¬†The portafilter and the machine itself feel somewhat cheap. Although I‚Äôve had this machine for two years and it works perfectly fine, it‚Äôs mainly a perception based on my experiences with other machines.
2. **Espresso Quality:**¬†The extractions are okay most of the time. I know they aren‚Äôt technically great, but at my level, I can enjoy my morning latte without issues. However, compared to machines like the Breville Barista Pro, the extraction using the pressurized portafilter is noticeably different and stronger, even with the same coffee beans.

**Why am I interested in the Gaggia?:**

I‚Äôve been researching local resellers and coffee stores, and it seems like the best option available in terms of size, capabilities, and materials.

What are your thoughts? I‚Äôm sure there are others out there who have had the Delonghi before!

Thank you all for your input and feedback.

We‚Äôve known eachother for just over a year and been in a committed relationship for 6 months.
We only got into a monogamous relationship after he confessed to me that he slept with his ex four months earlier, when we were still only dating. He says it opened his eyes to how he feels nothing for her anymore and sees her as a friend. While I was fine with them being friends beforehand, now that I knew they slept together while we were dating I was not happy at all with them having this level of closeness and wanted him to tell her they couldn‚Äôt be hanging out or speaking regularly anymore. I also had to ask he told her that sleeping together could never happen again.
A month goes by and he tells me they were going to hang out. I was incredibly upset at him moving the goalposts on me, but decided it would be fine as long as he called me immediately after they met for coffee.
Soon after, I moved into his flat who is owned by his ex‚Äôs family. They are billionaires and he lives there rent free.
It was meant to be for only two months for a work project I got in his city. He then starts telling me he wants me to live there permanently as this would allow us to save up for projects together, go travelling in Mexico, he wanted to support me through a difficult family situation and celebrate my birthday abroad with me.
Nearly a month later he changed his mind on me moving in permanently. Saying that by asking permission for me to move in he‚Äôd have to admit to not having asked permission for the three months I already spent there and he didn‚Äôt want to do that. I was disappointed but understood where he was coming from. He offered to pay for half my rent or for my flights for our travels as he wouldn‚Äôt have been paying rent, and wanted me to stay in his same city.
He then goes to have a conversation with his ex‚Äôs mum and speaks to her of his plan. Saying he wants to go to Mexico and is waiting to have enough money saved up. She offers to pay for him to go now. And he accepts. Without mentioning me at all, our plans or my court case (family situation) he said he‚Äôd support me through. He said he forgot about it, and went to set it straight only after I asked him to. Said he didn‚Äôt mention my birthday to her because with the dates they were looking at he‚Äôd be back on time, and that this doesn‚Äôt disrupt our plan for Mexico as we can still go together.
Meanwhile his ex is acting upset at him because she wants him to put more effort into their friendship and says she is struggling at feeling like I‚Äôve replaced her. He reacted by telling her she needs to be happy for him moving on if she want to be in his life, but also agrees on putting more effort into their friendship so she‚Äôs happy.

This was all a bit too stressful for me. Even though he set things straight by telling his ex‚Äôs mum about my court case i don‚Äôt feel like I should have asked to be mentioned and feel valued. And I think an ex who is feeling jealousy towards your relationship should be distanced, not consoled. I do think he‚Äôs a great person. But perhaps a bit selfish and unable to make me feel respected and considered front of his ex and their family money.

Figured since these are an Italian thing that's been around for decades, I would try to see what traditional Moka coffee is all about

First question is about cleaning. I know not to use dishwasher machine. But it's unclear if I can use something like Dawn dish soap to clean this thing, just like I use for all my other in sink hand washing. It feels like the pot and it's parts out of the box have some residual oils from manufacturing on it.  I don't think plain hot water is going to really get that off. 

Secondly, I don't have any other coffee on hand at the moment.  Been drinking tea lately. I know I'm supposed to brew a few batches that get thrown out before making a brew I can drink.  I don't really want to do that with the coffee pictured above as it isn't exactly cheap. Maybe just get something cheap from Trader Joe's?  I do have a grinder.

One of the girls and i didnt like each other to say the very least. Cate and my other roommate (dana) asked me if i was ok with them seeing our neighbours. I said ok. They've been going to their place for drinking and chatting ect while i go out with other friends. 2 days ago dana and cate asked if i was cool having the neighbours over this weekend since i will not be home to see some friends out of town. I understood its not polite for them to keep going and never inviting them over. But i felt a like an outsider and left out so i was down that day and didnt join conversations. At night we sat down for some coffee and i decided to let it go and not bring this subject over. Today cate didnt really talk to me and ate alone in her room. I asked why she didnt join me and she said she needed to talk to me over something. When we sat down she said she felt that i disrespected her by shutting her down for a day and that she looked for a place to move out. I was puzzled and said i didnt mean it and i did so to bc i needed space to think it over. She said that she felt like a stranger in her house bc of me so she thinks our friendship is irreversably damaged. She thinks its unfair i got hurt when she always asked for my opinion. I didnt want to affect her friendship so i chose to keep quite. She said me moving out with them wasnt her plan at first and how she tolerates her room being the smallest when i have the biggest feels like she sacrificed her comfort for nothing. I just got up and left. I dont know what to do and feel incredibly betrayed. Dana says she feels like we are both right in our own way but i cant understand why me keeping to myself for a day has to responded with how im a burden and all my friendship with her is now amounts to nothing.

I had a phase when i hated on them so much, and now i visit them every month and drink a coffee with them, find hobbies, like cooking, reading and growing plants. if you had a breakup, dont be sad about it, the best part about being young is that you will meet many people, maybe one day you will find the one true love, just to discover that it wasnt meant to be after all, and then one day when you least expect it and are older, it will most likely happen, i went through relationships with a guy and a gal and i am just happy with not being in a relationship at the moment, it gives me time to concentrate on myself.  just always remember to live out your teens happy and sad and full of adventure, i went to the island Sylt when it was flooded with punks and anarchist, i did a few things i regretted afterwards, but now i look back and realize it was an amazing time and i had lots of fun. go travel. be yourself. dont be afraid to ask anyone for help if you need any sort of help for anything, people always help, even if it might not seem like anyone cares. also be kind to those around you you love, some of them might not be there to see you reach 20 years. go out and fish with your grandpa to bond. hug your parents every once in a while, they really need that. dont bully your siblings, or at least just kiss them and tell them you love them.

i hope this message finds you all really well. maybe i have said some things repeatedly and im sorry for that, but those are the most important parts.

I would love someone who will let me be clingy, respond in a timely manner (or let me know that you're away/busy), have a dark sense of humor, and is open and honest, I tend to prefer thick body types but I'm more into your personality.

My chest feels tight. I am scared I might get a heart attack and die.

I am sick but I am traveling rn, and up until 2 hours ago, I felt relatively ok. I had a dry cough the last few days. Yesterday it was worse, but I had a cry and slept enough and after that it was better again. I am scared I will die rn. I was at a train station and had to catch a connecting train, and suddenly felt really feverish. (Now I have left the toilet and am standing in the train floor) I had too much caffeine due to coffee + cold medication today, and when I felt feverish I went into the nearest apothecary and the staff there told me I look like I‚Äôm about to collapse. 

I sat down and they gave me Aspirin, another cold medication with Pseudoephedrine. I was sweating a lot and felt like I was about to start hallucinating. I am feeling better fever wise but I am scared as f*ck that I will overexhaust or overexert my body/put too much strain on my heart and will die. I was about to have an ambulance called for me and just stay at my connecting trains stop because I was feeling so shitty. I also bought a thermometer impulsively and measured my temperature after taking the Aspirin, it was still in normal range üòÖ

However if I close my eyes I can see images flashing in front of my eyes. I‚Äôve had it before that my body started hurting and I had body aches that gave me pain to the point of literally screaming in agony, and it all ended in a flashback and a trauma release. I am beginning to suspect this might be something similar, or a mix, but I am unsure. It‚Äôs just, the images flashing in front of my eyes and my body automatically going into certain positions when I start shivering‚Ä¶

I wanted to go to Amsterdam and see my favorite band tonight (that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm on the train for, and my inner child/I was very excited for this, that‚Äôs why I chose to go despite being sick). I waited 8 years for this. I might not be able to make it.

I feel terrified. 

Should I go to the concert regardless? Should I stay in bed and wait for a maybe trauma release to happen? I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I am going to die right now.

Just shipped my recipe/meal planning app after months of solo dev work. The core features are solid - AI recipe imports from any source (photos/websites/social), smart shopping lists, and meal planning. No bloat, no ads, cross platform.

The app's getting good initial feedback from family and friends but organic downloads are 0. What would be your first moves to get more eyeballs on it?

I'm thinking about:

* ASO optimization (current keywords focus on ""recipe manager"" ""meal planner"" ""grocery list"")
* Content marketing (recipe blog?)
* Reaching out to food bloggers
* Maybe an automated social media recipes page on Tiktok? (not something I would enjoy doing but might be necessary for true organic growth)

For those who've launched similar lifestyle/utility apps - what worked best for early growth? Any pitfalls to avoid?

P.S. DM if you want to check it out! Always happy to exchange feedback with fellow devs

It was concluded that men's testosterone levels influence their buying decisions.

The study, which was published in Nature Communications, involved a double-blind test. The participants were male subjects who were similar in age and socioeconomic status. They were given a placebo or a dose of testosterone gel.

The men were shown five sets of products that had similar perceived quality. However, one of these featured a higher social ranking.

The products featured in the experiment included various types of equipment and vehicles, such as coffee machines, watches, and luxury cars. The men were then asked to rank the brands by rating them on a scale of one to 10.

Although the descriptions of the products were similar, the researchers used different terms to emphasize the link between power, status, and high quality. For instance, one of the watches featured in the experiment had a description that said, ""supreme"" quality. On the other hand, the words used to emphasize status, such as ""sophisticated,"" ""prestige,"" and ""world-famous,"" were used to describe the products.

The results of the study revealed that men's testosterone levels affected their purchasing decisions.

Men who were given the hormone preferred products that were referred to as ""status-enhancing.""

According to the researchers, male hormones tend to increase in response to certain events, such as when one encounters an attractive partner or after a divorce.

The authors noted that the results of the study could also be reversed since men who own status-enhancing products tend to have higher testosterone levels.",1,1731605505.0,EDrugstore,0,1.0,False

I was 29, visiting for vacation with friends, eager to explore the city and unwind. One afternoon, as we relaxed in a coffee shop, a friend convinced me to download Bumble. We laughed as we swiped left and right with no real intention of meeting anyone‚Äîuntil I matched with Takumi. He was 30, a Japanese guy in town for work. His last night in Singapore, he explained, as he was heading to Malaysia the next day for another business stop.

There was an instant spark in our conversation, and in an impulsive decision, we agreed to meet that very afternoon. We set our meeting point at a shoe store, a casual spot that somehow suited the spontaneity of it all. I arrived first, feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness as I spotted him before he saw me. Takumi had a calm, collected presence, and I found myself hesitating, unable to make the first move. But when our eyes finally met, his warm smile put me at ease, and I walked over to meet him.

We started at a nearby coffee shop, where he treated me to a cup of coffee. Conversation flowed effortlessly as we shared stories about our lives‚Äîmy carefree vacation, his busy travel schedule, and how we ended up in Singapore. After a few minutes, he asked if I‚Äôd like to grab some drinks, and I agreed, feeling an easy comfort with him. Soon, we were in a Grab heading to a restaurant along the Singapore River.

The restaurant had a lively, open-air vibe with the river running alongside. Over drinks, we continued to talk. We talked about the places we wanted to visit, his life in Japan, and my life back home. Eventually, we decided to take a walk along the river. The heat was intense, so Takumi stopped at a 7-Eleven to buy us a bottle of water. We found a quiet bench overlooking the river, where we sat, letting the evening settle around us.

Sitting there in the heat, my heart raced‚Äînot just from the temperature but from how he looked at me. He reached for my hand, and it felt so natural, as if we had done it a thousand times before. At some point, he leaned closer, and our first kiss happened there by the riverside, the world fading out around us. It was brief, but it felt as if it held a world of its own.

We eventually had to part ways; my friends were waiting, and I had the key to our hotel room. We lingered a bit longer, not wanting to let go of that moment. We exchanged goodbyes, neither of us wanting it to end but knowing it had to.

We kept in touch now and then, exchanging messages and memories, though the distance and our lives often got in the way. I still find myself wondering about him, hoping that one day, our paths will cross again.",1,1731605445.0,u_stickyprice,0,1.0,False

Lunch: this is my smallest meal, if I eat it at all. I do eat a lunch on the weekends, but not usually during the work week. I'd say if I do eat lunch, it's somewhere around 150-250 calories. 
Dinner: this is usually my heaviest meal. It varies some but I'd say on average its probably around 500-600 calories if I had to guess. 

I have gotten better about incorporating fruits and veggies into my diet. I eat a lot of spinach, green beans, and broccoli. I will admit that I do have a decent amount of pasta/bread. That is significantly harder to cut out, since my bf does not want to change that part of our diet. I do try to substitute red meats for chicken/turkey though. 

I have tried cardio (pretty much speed walking on a treadmill because I hate running) but I saw no progress. I'm also borderline agoraphobic (which is half the reason I'm on antianxiety meds now) so leaving my apartment is hard. Ive been trying to do Pilates, since I can do that right in my living room. However, I've found that when I exercise like that, it makes my body sore for an entire week, which makes it hard for me to stay consistent with it. 

I feel like I've tried doing everything as close to right as I can, but can't seem to lose any weight at all. I don't even care to be super thin, I think I'd be comfortable at 160 pounds. Does anyone have any suggestions? 

Also if there's any at home workouts that you guys could recommend, that'd be great too. ",1,1731605390.0,WeightLossAdvice,13,0.67,False

Nickel! It's fricken Nickel. It's a mild allergy, but my doctor said a mild allergy can absolutely still trigger this. I wish I got this done 6 months ago when this all started.

It makes sense:

**Contact**

* Anytime I go to the gym and touch the machines, within a minute my hands are on fire
* Touched the metal putting together my daughter's bed, hands on fire
* Had a smart watch and after a couple hours, wrist was on fire

**Food**

* There's soy in my gluten-free protein powder
* I have peanut butter with said soy powder, daily
* I have coffee everyday

My doc gave me a list of foods to avoid, and foods that are safe to eat. She also gave me a list where Nickel is in terms of contact - and it's EVERYWHERE! Or at least it seems to be in things I touch all the time. Phone cases, potentially keyboards, car keys, belt buckles, zippers, jewellery, watches, etc etc etc. Maybe my fridge too? Maybe pots and pans?

I'm very happy that I found my trigger! And now I'm ordering a Nickel-testing package to swap questionable items.

My question for anyone with a nickel allergy - how did you have success in managing it? Did you buy plastic covers for everything?

1gra4qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1gra4qq/what_is_your_philosophy_on_doing_smaller_spells/,What is your philosophy on doing smaller spells that are in service of a goal of a bigger spell you cast?  ,"Hi! I‚Äôm trying to figure out my own philosophy of magic and it‚Äôs really helpful to hear from all of you. I‚Äôm also relatively new and have learned so much already from lurking, so thank you! 

I‚Äôm wondering how you view doing smaller spells to support a bigger one you may have cast. For example, if you do a spell jar to manifest something in a 1-6 month timeline (let‚Äôs say to meet a best friend), is it okay to also do other smaller spells, like stirring your coffee with intentions or orgasm magic or bay leaf spells or chanting or whatever else, with that goal in mind? I‚Äôm thinking like one thing a week. 

Intuitively it feels okay to me to send a little more magic that way and raise the energy, but I don‚Äôt want to interfere with the original spell or become obsessed with outcome. 

While we‚Äôre here, what are your thoughts on doing a different bigger spell if say 3 months have passed? Perhaps you did a honey jar but instead you think Open Roads would be better. Would you first release the first spell?

1gra2sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CBDdaily/comments/1gra2sp/what_type_of_cbd_is_good_for_focus/,What type of CBD is good for focus? ,"I thought most people took CBD for pain management or anxiety, but I saw a product recently advertised as ""for focus"". 1) is this a thing? 2) what makes a particular type of CBD good for focus vs sleep vs anxiety. I have always had problems focusing, it's worse at work, I stare off into space, get lost in the tasks. I have zero energy, and drink tons of coffee to keep myself awake and alert. 

I‚Äôve personally struggled with staying focused, especially at work. I often find myself staring off into space or feeling scattered, with zero energy to spare. To cope, I‚Äôve relied heavily on coffee, but the jittery side effects and caffeine crashes have left me searching for alternatives. Enter CBD, which I‚Äôm now exploring as a potential solution for focus and alertness.   
  
Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

**Is CBD for focus seriously a thing?** 

Yes. While CBD is best known for its calming effects, it can also help promote mental clarity and energy in certain situations. This is partially due to the way it supports sleep quality, which, in turn, affects daytime energy levels and overall mood. So, yes, using CBD for better focus is more than just hype.

**How does CBD improve energy and focus?** 

The secret is the **endocannabinoid system** **(ECS)**. All mammals have an ECS, which is a neuromodulatory system that regulates cognitive and emotional responses.¬†

The ECS also regulates mood, behavior, and other aspects of neurological health (memory, learning, temperature control, sleep, and pain response). This is why CBD can improve everything from stress to energy.

**What types of CBD should you take for focus, alertness?** 

There are many different CBD products, such as gummies, tincture oil, and creams. Which is the best one to give you a boost during the day? 

For energy and focus, I recommend sticking with edibles (gummies, tinctures, or capsules) since they deliver the most consistent and easily controlled effects. Beginners often find that gummies or capsules are the easiest to take and dose as well. 

Choosing the right CBD product for focus involves considering several factors, like bioavailability, ease of use, and desired effects. Here‚Äôs a more detailed breakdown:

**Full-Spectrum CBD**: Contains a range of cannabinoids, terpenes, and a trace amount of THC (less than 0.3%). The ""entourage effect"" from the combination of cannabinoids may enhance focus and clarity for some users. However, if you‚Äôre sensitive to THC or need to avoid it for work-related reasons, consider a different option.

**Broad-Spectrum CBD:** This is similar to full-spectrum but without any THC. It still contains other cannabinoids and terpenes, providing a boost to your ECS without the risk of drowsiness or THC-related side effects. Broad-spectrum products can be an excellent middle ground for improving focus and energy.

**Nano-Emulsified CBD**: This type of CBD is broken down into tiny particles, making it more easily absorbed by the body. If you‚Äôre looking for fast-acting effects, nano-emulsified CBD could be a game-changer. It‚Äôs commonly found in tinctures and water-soluble formulas.

**Caffeine-Infused CBD Products**: Some CBD brands offer products specifically formulated with natural stimulants like caffeine or matcha. These combinations can provide a smoother, more balanced energy boost compared to traditional coffee, without the jitters.

**Adaptogen-Infused CBD**: Products that combine CBD with adaptogens, like ashwagandha, rhodiola, or ginseng, are designed to help the body adapt to stress and improve focus and mental clarity. If you often feel mentally drained, these blends could be worth exploring.

**Tinctures vs. Capsules**: While tinctures can be absorbed quickly under the tongue for more immediate effects, capsules offer a slow and steady release throughout the day. If you need sustained focus, capsules might be the way to go, but for quick relief, tinctures are ideal. I personally like using the oil tinctures so I can adjust my dose as needed. 

**Dosage Tip:** 

Always start with the recommended dosage. You can gradually adjust as needed, but it's best to begin low and slow to see how your body reacts. Even if something promises ""focus"" doesn't mean that this is what you will personally experience. I've learned this over and over again. Sometimes your body just responds differently. 

I take CBD once a day, first thing in the morning. If you‚Äôre unsure about dosage, every brand has dosage recommendations, and I suggest sticking with these suggestions first and working your way up (if necessary).

**THC or no THC?**

Some CBD products are still made with THC. Taking CBD alone or the broad-spectrum one may sound better because many people think a little bit of THC will make them tired. Is that true?

Personally, THC makes me tired. Soul CBD offers a high-THC gummy in their focus line, but I use the broad-spectrum and CBD isolates in this line. That said, others may feel a boost of energy when using THC. These products are different for everyone, so I suggest trying them all and finding the one that works best for you.

**Safety and Side Effects: Some Things to Be Aware Of**

CBD is safe and only comes with mild side effects. It‚Äôs important to note that fatigue is a side effect, which is why some people may feel tired when taking CBD. That‚Äôs why I recommend the Soul CBD line, since it‚Äôs made with added ingredients to boost energy. CBD isn‚Äôt addictive, but if this is a concern for you, avoid any CBD products with THC.

You might think like okay at least you have something works all the time, you are kinda right but trust me it has its own issues. We were having a lot of back pain but now we are stronger I guess so it is not an issue. But biggest problem is he is not sleeping in his bed, stroller, carseat etc. nowhere other than the carrier IF we jump on the ball. 

Lets say we went out for a quick coffee and he is sleeping in carrier. If he wakes up, %90 of the time it is impossible to put him back to sleep and he just screams non-stop. Once he screamed that much he had his voice cracked next 2 days.

A couple weeks ago I started to feel irritable from anxiety, especially whenever I had coffee. It gotten worse of the last week or so where I have the anxiety whether I drink coffee or not (trying to stay way since it only makes things worse right now).

  
My question is, for anyone that has experienced this, did it subside toward the end of treatment for you once you adjusted? Did it only get better once you completed your 36 sessions? 

I am not manic, I'm sleeping easily and deeply, but I just feel the generalized anxiety I used to feel before I was ever treated for my anxiety. Small tasks start to make me feel panicky and nervous. Normal things feel difficult and hard to sort out in my brain to accomplish. Is this a dip possibly or is that just related to depression? I spoke with the psych and he didn't seem to have much to say or seem to have heard much of this from other patients besides the possibility of mania which I don't experience. He said maybe to skip my session on Friday to give me a 3 day break with the weekend. I just feel like a frayed wire. Like I'm functioning frantically and do not feel grounded at all. My OCD doesn't feel better and I'm so anxious and hopeless feeling I'm not sure if it's coming from the depression or my anxiety making me feel down.

If any of my active RP partners see this: I‚Äôm not replacing anyone.¬†**You are awesome and I value you highly!**

To everyone else:¬†*Hi, nice to meet you!*

**Introduction**

I‚Äôm Luc, a 24 y/o from Central Europe, looking for an additional RP partner around my age. I am looking to create a strong, longterm connection and build an interesting story with you. So far, I‚Äôve only dabbled in realistic settings and SoL stories but I‚Äôm open to try out something new ‚Äî I‚Äôm very much open to any ideas you might have.

¬†**A few KEY requirements**

* You‚Äôre somewhat¬†**literate**¬†and have¬†**good grammar**.
* You don‚Äôt just write one- or two-liners but if you put¬†**effort**¬†into your paragraphs.
* You‚Äôre willing to role-play on¬†**Discord**.
* You're open to put effort into getting to know each other,¬†**OOC**.
* You‚Äôre a¬†**communicative**¬†RP partner, we make decisions together.
* You‚Äôre okay with writing in¬†**past 3rd tense**.
* You‚Äôre looking for a¬†**slow-burn**,¬†**longterm**¬†RP.
* You‚Äôre¬†**patient**¬†(My life‚Äôs quite busy, I don‚Äôt get to write that often. But when I do, I put a lot of effort in and I value everyone who can respect that.)

**Some ideas to get the creative juices flowing:**

I‚Äôm strongly looking to add a realistic slowburn romance plot to what I‚Äôm currently writing on. A few ideas I have would be:

* **Friends-to-Lovers**:¬†After a rough breakup, a dedicated student asks their best friend to be their ‚Äûfake date‚Äú to events to avoid awkward encounters with their ex. But as they start playing the role of a couple, lingering feelings and unexpected sparks blur the line between friendship and love. Things get complicated when the ex tries to worm back into their life, stirring up old jealousy and confusion.
* **Friends-to-Lovers**:¬†Two childhood friends make a pact that if they're both single by the time they turn 21, they'll go on a date. As the birthday approaches, one friend starts dating someone new, leaving the other grappling with feelings they didn‚Äôt realize were there. The tension mounts when meddling friends and family pick up on the unspoken feelings, pushing them to confront what‚Äôs been right in front of them all along.
* **Strangers-to-Lovers**:¬†Both night owls, two students keep running into each other during late-night study sessions at the library. What starts as an awkward series of encounters turns into quiet conversations, shared coffee breaks, and exchanged study tips. Their connection deepens as they find solace in each other‚Äôs company, but as final exams approach, both are unsure if the other feels the same way, and friends insist on playing ‚Äûmatchmaker‚Äú to get them out of their shells.
* **Enemies-to-Lovers**:¬†Two students with completely opposite personalities, one very academic, the other a laid-back party-goer, are forced to share a dorm room after a mix-up in administration. Their clashing lifestyles create tension, and both of them can‚Äôt stand the other‚Äôs habits. But when a campus event puts them on the same team, they start seeing each other in a new light. Old flings and new rumors create additional hurdles.

So, if you‚Äôve read this far without clicking away:¬†**Thank you!**¬†If you have any other ideas, please feel free to tell me about them, I¬†look forward to your message via PM or DM. If your message just says ¬´I‚Äôd love to RP¬ª or ¬´Interested¬ª, I probably won‚Äôt get back to you, but if you cook up a somewhat literate response and maybe also write a couple of sentences about yourself and your writing habits, I‚Äôm more likely to be interested. :)

1gr9uzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1gr9uzt/quick_trip_report_tokyo_nagano_izu_in_november/,"Quick trip report: Tokyo, Nagano, Izu in November 2024","We're just back from 7 full days & nights in Japan and wanted to share details of our trip in the event it's helpful or interesting to someone reading this.

This was our second trip, first trip was in 2019. We are a 40ish married couple who are comparatively fast/active travelers. Poor Japanese abilities but enough to get around. We really don't like crowds and love nature and hiking. We brought one backpack per person which was plenty for our clothes and small souvenirs. 

**Flights**:

We flew **ANA economy** from JFK on the new (3-4-3) 777. We sat in the second row (31) and the window seat had less space than usual under the seat due to row 30 being an emergency exit row.¬†

The plane was not hot and we had individual air nozzles. I was comfortable wearing a hoodie. The food was subpar on the way there and much better coming home. Service was great, especially for passengers with babies - they brought out special toys and bassinets and all sorts of stuff. 

Some ANA international flights arrive and depart from **Terminal 2 at Haneda**, including ours. Arriving there is AWESOME - it took us 3 minutes to go through customs and there was no line to take a shower. The food/shopping options inside security at Terminal 2 are terrible and you are not allowed to exit and re-enter, so if you want to eat or shop at the airport on the way out, do it before security.

**Hotels:**

We spent a total of $1,383 USD for 2 people for 7 nights. We chose nice-ish business hotels that had bigger beds and public baths that averaged $170ish/night. We also included a splurge on one night at a resort with meals included. With proper advance planning you could stay for much cheaper than we did and still be comfortable.

**Transportation:**

We used public transportation exclusively: local train, limited express, shinkansen, and bus. No rail pass. It took some getting used to having to visit ATMs to refill IC cards and buy train tickets, but we figured it out. Cash was useful on the bus. Take a ticket and pay fare when you get off - on the bus we took from Nagano to Togakushi they can make change for 1000 yen notes but not the new 500 yen coins.

**Itinerary:**

[Photo album](https://imgur.com/gallery/k5Mi7xb)

**Day 1: Tokyo (1 night) - 30,174 steps**

* Arrived at 5 AM at HND, took showers at the airport in Terminal 2
* Dropped bags off at hotel: **Almont Nippori** (JR Nippori station, on Yamanote Line and also direct access to Narita).
* Explored Yanaka Cemetery and area, visited Tokyo National Museum.
* Checked out **Akihabara.** Pretty neat to walk around for an hour or so. We love **Mandarake**.
* Afternoon snacks and drinks at **Nikujiru Gyoza No Dandadan Nishinippori** near the hotel. Fried cheese w/salt is so good.
* Checked into hotel and used the public bath. It was really nice - no wonder this place is always sold out.
* Dinner at **Sushi Mihiro** in Nezu. Really good omakase course - 15 pieces for 5300 yen, plus incredible fried oysters. Modern, non-stuffy vibe. The chef is young, speaks some English, and the sushi was a little more saucy and experimental than other more traditional Edomae sushi places. Because our reservation was 5:30 pm on a Wednesday, it was just us and one local guy who was a regular. 

**Day 2: Matsumoto (2 nights) - 23,714 steps** 

* Train from Shinjuku to Matsumoto on **Azusa Limited Express.** We bought tickets same day and the one we wanted was full so we had to wait until the next train. In the future I would buy tickets ahead of time. 
* Dropped bags off at hotel: **Onyado Nono Matsumoto Premium Hot Spring.** This is a premium Dormy Inn brand hotel with traditional Japanese decor and rooms. No shoes in the hotel. Best public bath facilities of our trip - indoor and outdoor hot soaking tubs, cold pool and sauna.
* Explored town on foot, stopping by **Agatanomori Park, AEON Mall, Matsumoto Castle, Nawate-dori and Nakamichi-dori**. Stopped for beers at **Matsumoto Brewing** \- both taprooms.
* After a nap, we went to **Amiya** for dinner, which is a spectacular restaurant that only serves hamburg patties over rice. They don't take reservations. The staff speak great English. Matsumoto is famous for wasabi and there is pickled and fresh wasabi + several varieties of shichimi (seven spice) to sauce up your burger. 

**Day 3: Nakasendo Hike & Matsumoto - 29,460 steps**

* Took a local train to **Yabuhara** station, where we hiked **Torii Pass** to **Narai-juku.** The hike took us about 2 hours. It is over a mountain and down the other side, with public toilets at both ends and in the middle. Nice changing colors in the trees and **Ontake Shrine** at the top was beautiful. We walked really fast because there was a large tour group behind us.
* We caught the 11:26 am train back from Narai to Matsumoto. Had duck ramen from **Komugi Soba Ike** for lunch. Very light, fresh flavors - not heavy like tonkotsu ramen.
* Went back to **AEON Mall** to do some shopping and got stuck there for a while.
* Headed to **Matsumoto Tsunagu Yokocho** for first dinner and drinks after an accidental nap. This is a cool indoor space with 10 different stalls. You're encouraged to eat and drink a little at each one. We had crab croquettes at the Hokkaido-themed stall and moved on because it was really crowded (mostly locals but tourists are welcome) and not an amazing price/quality ratio. 
* For second dinner, we walked into **Yaegi** which is a gorgeous, small izakaya on a side street near the train station. It was almost full but we got a table! Here we had Caesar salad, yakitori and a wonderful broiled cod that melted in our mouth.

**Day 4: Togakushi & Nagano - 32,810 steps**

* From Matsumoto we took a local train to Nagano. The train was cold and I was very glad to be wearing my puffy jacket. I was so excited to see the view from **Obasute station** but it was early and therefore foggy.
* Took Alpico bus #70 from Nagano to **Togakushi** to hike the shrines. We chose to get off at **Togakushi-Hokosha** and hike up to **Chusha** and **Okusha** (the famous one with cedar trees), then hike down via **Kagami-Ike.** This turned out to be an epic hiking day with lots and lots of stone steps. I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in great mountain views and shrines. 
* Checked into hotel for the night, **Chisun Grand Nagano.** Pretty average, no public bath, but their coffee machine in the lobby is on all night!
* **Nagano City** gets a lot of shit for being boring but it's pretty lively around the station on a Saturday night. We stopped at an izakaya that specializes in Okinawan pig-related organ meats and a dirt cheap sushi spot, neither of which I can find in the light of day. Both were packed with locals and had open seats. 

**Day 5: Nagano & Izu Peninsula - 17,452 steps**

* In the morning we walked from our hotel to **Zenkoji,** which is one of the most famous temples in Japan. We got there about 7:00 am and very few people were there, and we could watch and hear a morning service taking place. It was a beautiful experience.
* Took the Kagayaki (Hokuriku) shinkansen from Nagano to Tokyo, then the Kodama (Tokaido) shinkansen from Tokyo to **Atami** which was a fucking zoo on Sunday at lunchtime. From Atami, we took a local train to **Futo** station. This turned out to be a really cool sightseeing train with bench seats facing the ocean. 
* Walked down a huge steep hill and along a highway to reach **ISANA Resort**. I cannot say enough great things about this place. 
   * The food they serve is AMAZING. Dinner is French kaiseki with locally caught fish and 5 month dry aged wagyu beef, served over a 2 hour course with two desserts. Breakfast was Japanese traditional style with top-level ingredients. I counted 33 plates for breakfast for two. 
   * All rooms include private outdoor open-air baths with an ocean view, and the rooms themselves are huge by Japanese standards. We booked the suite, which is 60 sq m (646 sq ft in freedom units). There is also a smart TV in the room. 
   * You can reserve the private onsen with ocean view for yourself and your sweetie/friends.
   * It was only $373 USD/52,400 yen/night for two people to stay in the suite including dinner and breakfast. This is like what people pay to stay in a normal hotel in Shibuya that doesn't include anything. 

**Day 6: Jogasaki Coast & Tokyo - 29,841 steps**

* After our WONDERFUL breakfast and rest day, we were ready for more hiking - so we headed to **Jogasaki-Kaigan** station to hike along the coast and soak in the incredible coastal scenery. This area is pretty famous and there was at least one Chinese tour bus there, but everyone congregated near the **Kadowaki Suspension Bridge** area. 
* We followed the **Jogasaki Nature Study Course** trail via **Renchaku-ji** temple. There are lots and lots of [Joro spiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichonephila_clavata) around so if you're tall, pay attention to your surroundings so you don't get a faceful.
* After our hike, we took a local train and Kodama shinkansen to Shinagawa station, where we spent 2 nights at the **Mitsui Garden Hotel** in Gotanda. This hotel was nice - gorgeous city views from the 15th floor lobby and a decent sized room.
* We really liked Gotanda as a base - it's on the Yamanote line between Shinagawa and Shibuya, so near the bottom of the loop. It is a mostly commercial area with lots of cheap places to eat and drink, including what appears to be a shopping mall full of bars at **Gotanda Hills.** 
* In the evening we had a standing sushi bar snack at **Sushi Uogashi Nihon Ichi Gotanda,** then met up with a friend in Shinjuku where my husband got a great deal on a used camera from **Map Camera**. We had conveyor belt sushi for dinner at **Oedo Shinjukuminamiguchiten.**
* Finished the night at a cozy, friendly rock-themed whiskey bar in the Gotanda Hills bar-mall, **Stone Cold.**

**Day 7: Tokyo - 25,958 steps**

* We were massively hungover so we stopped by **Oniyanma** udon shop under the bridge by Gotanda station at 8 am. The chicken tempura udon was phenomenal - no wonder there was a line.
* Walked from Gotanda to Meguro by the river and did some shopping at a department store near Meguro station. 
* In the afternoon, we visited **Ochanomizu** so I could take a picture of three trains at once from **Hijiri Bridge.** Ochanomizu is a very cute student-y neighborhood with a lot of musical instrument shops - a must for anyone who likes guitars.
* Walked from Ochanomizu to the **Onitsuka Tiger** store in Ueno-Okachimachi via Akihabara, stopping to see **Kanda Myojin Shrine.** 
* Met up with a friend near Ginza, which is cool to walk through at night. We had beers at **Sapporo ""The Bar""** and a fantastic tonkatsu dinner at **Tonkatsu Hasegawa Higashiginza.** 
* Walked up to **Yurakucho** station to take pictures of passing trains before heading to the hotel for our last night before the flight back to NY in the morning. 

**Takeaways & Tips:**

* 7 days is not much time at all, but for two people who desperately needed a break from stressful jobs and don't have a bathtub at home, it worked great for us. I had planned this trip obsessively for months leading up to it and got very burned out feeling about a week prior, but as soon as we left our house to go to the airport the excitement was back!
* There do seem to be a lot more tourists than in 2019 but it is still very easy to avoid congested areas and tourist traps if you are willing to pass over the most popular attractions or go at funky times.
* Japanese people like to be warm indoors. Trains, stores, etc. are warm bordering on hot, so layers are a good idea. 
* Everyone says this but I'll say it again - **wear the right shoes and don't wear shitty socks!** I wore wool socks and my Hokas every day and got zero blisters. According to my watch we walked 92 miles/148 km in seven days, so I'll take that as a win. 
* Finally - it seems like lots of people in Japan have some kind of respiratory virus this time of year, so bring headphones for trains if you don't want to listen to people choking on phlegm the entire time. I was really gla I did. On public transportation including planes I'd say at least 50% or more of Japanese people wore masks.  ",1,1731604639.0,JapanTravel,0,1.0,False

# Background and study aims¬†In colonoscopy, preparation is often regarded as the most burdensome part of the intervention. Traditionally, specific diets have been recommended, but the evidence to support this policy is insufficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the decision not to follow a restrictive diet on bowel preparation and colonoscopy outcomes.

# Patients and methods¬†This was a multicenter, controlled, non-inferiority randomized trial with FIT-positive screening colonoscopy. The subjects were assigned to follow the current standard (1-day low residue diet [LRD]) or a liberal diet. The allocation was balanced for the risk of inadequate cleansing using the Dik et al. score. All participants received the same instructions for morning colonoscopy preparation. The primary outcome was the rate of adequate preparations as defined by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale. Secondary outcomes included tolerability and measures of colonoscopy performance and quality.

# Results¬†A total of 582 subjects were randomized. Of these, 278 who received the liberal diet and 275 who received the 1-day LRD were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Non-inferiority was demonstrated with adequate preparation rates of 97.8% in the 1-day LRD and 96.4% in the liberal diet group. Tolerability was higher with the liberal diet (94.7% vs. 83.2%). No differences were found with respect to cecal intubation time, aspirated volume, or length of the examination. Global and right colon average adenoma detection rates per colonoscopy were similar.

# Conclusions¬†The liberal diet was non-inferior to the 1-day LRD, and increased tolerability. Colonoscopy performance and quality were not affected. ([NCT05032794](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05032794))",1,1731604507.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

And I dispute the idea that their use of public spaces is any different from that of an individual parking their bike in public. 

The biggest argument again them I see is that they ""privatise the profit but publicise the cost"", about how their business model relies on utilising public space to park and store their vehicles. My dispute is that this is exactly the same as any other bike. 

If you buy an e-bike for yourself, you have given profits to the company that sold your bike, and then you give profits to bike shops every time you take it in for maintenance and to Amazon every time you buy new inner tubes. You then utilise public space to store your bike when you go to the coffee shop or the office. 

This is fundamentally the same as the Limebike model; you just spread the cost out via a subscription rather than an upfront cost and pay a different amount for the convenience factor of having someone else move your bike around London. 

The fact that lime bikes are parked badly or take up space on bike racks has nothing to do with the fact that they are lime bikes and everything to do with the fact that a) many people that ride them are disrespectful, and b) massively more people are cycling. These issues would be equally real if everyone who ride a lime bike instead had their own personal bike. ",2,1731604308.0,londoncycling,12,0.55,False

While I have a whole lot more to say, I'm breaking it down to just some observations from my journey. This is not meant to be advice, just a summary of things I've experienced, so take from it what you will:

1. I had literally hundreds of Day 1s. Hundreds. Eventually, it stuck. Keep trying.

2. Tell someone, even if it is only one person. Having empathy and an ally helps a lot. 

3. I discovered I am an introvert. Stay home if you need to, for as long as it takes.

4. Going to bed at 8 pm is totally acceptable.

5. All cravings eventually end.

6. Nostalgia is a bitch, but the glasses are always rose-covered.

7. Most people do not drink as much as I thought they did, and some people really can have just one drink. That said...

8. I finally admitted to myself I don't ever want just one drink. I want 10. So, I have none.

8. People default to having food and drinks as the centerpiece of every social gathering. You have to work to get friends to do other things (like walks, or bookstores, or coffee, or movies) 

9. My skin and nails are so much better, and I actually stopped buying Tums.

10. Sit with the boredom. I had to acknowledge it, move on, and go DO something. Walks helped me a lot, even when I didn't want to go.

11. I am doing so much better at work. My anxiety around work has lessened dramatically.

12. The first 15 minutes of social events suck, but then it gets better. Also, I skipped a lot of social events altogether.

13. People did ask me ""you aren't drinking?"" quite often, but most of those people have their own issues with drinking, and my abstinence made them uncomfortable. This is not your problem. I just said ""I'm trying to be healthy."" That's it, and it's the truth.

14. Those who have a problem with me setting boundaries are the same people who were benefitting from me having none. (""You are so much more fun when you drink"" ""No. I was sick, and you were using me as your entertainment."").

14. Focusing on what I was gaining (sleep, freedom, health, money, time, self-respect, etc.), rather than what I lost, really did help. At the same time...

15. I did grieve the loss of alcohol for awhile (but again, rose-colored glasses...)

16. I never really liked the taste of alcoholic drinks. In the end, I just wanted the ethanol.

17. Podcasts, quit lit, memoirs. There are tons, and they help so much. I know I'm not alone.

18. Recovery is not the same as quitting drinking. I realized I have to do the work. At the same time...

19. It starts with committing to not drinking. Make the decision, and don't make it again. Just don't drink. I finally have the time and desire to do the work because I am free from the alcohol.

20. I try to focus on just making the next right choice, not on the mountain. As Anne Lamott says, life is like driving at night. You can only see 10 feet in front of you, but you can make the whole trip that way.

IWNDWYT. It gets better, people. So much better.

[Kingrinder K4/Delonghi Dedica],"Hello, I recently bought a Kingrinder 4 from ebay. Before that i used a relatively cheap electric coffee grinder ( Graef CM 800) which gave me on occasion a nice espresso but wasn't really reliable. Now that I use the Kingrinder K4 I get much more consistent results(retention is almost 0,1g btw) . But I' ve noticed that the espresso is more watery than before with the same coffee grounds and the same brew ratio. The grounds I use are more toward dark roasts (60 % Robusta / 40 % Arabica). But I also tried different coffee grounds. I use a delonghi dedica with a bottomless portafilter. My brew ratio is about 1:2 (14g in/ 28g out in \~25 seconds). I use a 3d printed wdt tool and a leveler.

So is the Kingrinder K4 to blame or could there be another explanation? ( I started with espresso making a year ago, so crappy technique is always an option)",2,1731604202.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1gr9om0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gr9om0/upgrading_my_setup_7000_usd/,Upgrading my setup [$7000 USD],"I'm looking to significantly upgrade from my 9 year old Gaggia Classic and Breville burr grinder.

Here's what our needs are:

I'm an engineer and a  ""hobbyist"" and tend to experiment and overcomplicate everything.

My wife just wants a good cup of coffee with minimal fuss. I could make her coffee some of the time but travel for work frequently, so it's got to work for her.

Mostly drink Americanos or black espresso but with a better setup, could see my wife wanting milk drinks.

Roughly 5-6 drinks per day.

I already tried upgrading to a single dose grinder, but that was a no-go from my wife.

Currently, we've found an espresso blend that we order directly from a roaster that works well with our machine. We haven't deviated from that for years, but I'd like to experiment with other beans.

Price range for both grinder and machine is $6-7k.

Here's where I'm leaning. Just curious if there are other machines I should be looking at in this price range, or anything I'm not thinking of with these options.

Decent De1Pro
Pros:
- Plenty of options to experiment
- Consistency
- Once dialed in, my wife can brew by pressing 1 button
-Fast heat up
- Small footprint

Cons:
-Heavily software dependent
-Possibly too many options
-Upgrades and accessories bump the price up: water tank cover, shower diffuser, drip tray cover scale adapter and skale2.
-Kinda ugly



Unknown:
-How fiddly is filling the water tank? Is that lever on the back a pain?
- Is there more to go wrong with this? How reliable is it? Do I turn it on in the morning and have to do a software update?


Eureka Atom W 75
- Flat Burr
- Hopper is a must
- Grind by weight
- Grind directly into portafilter

Also looked at the Acaia Orbit with hopper and scale, but you can't grind directly into the portafilter and it just seems that having 2 separate pieces means more can go wrong.

Couple other things to consider:
- I've mostly ruled out e61 machines because of the long heat up times and looks. I also feel like from a design the group head being small and away from the boiler would cause temp stability to suffer during a shot vs having a large chunk of metal close to the boiler.
-  I'd love to have a lever machine, but there's no way I can see my wife using that every morning.

Thanks in advance for the help and advice.

I know. I've seen a few threads complaining that customers don't know what a cappuccino is. But hear me out. I'm not a barista, nor a snobby connoisseur. But I spent six months in Italy a while back, and was introduced to Italian coffee from a few Italian friends who were probably a little too proud of their culinary heritage. I had never had a cappuccino until then. But I had more Italian cappuccinos than I could count in that time. When I got back to the US, I tried some at a few cafes, and they're never the same. There's a bunch of foam on top. That's what led me to the reddit threads about how customers always complain that there's too much foam in Starbucks cappuccinos, and the baristas always complain the customers don't know what they're ordering. I went down a bit of a rabbit hole trying to figure out what's going on. I'm not complaining, I'm just trying to understand. Maybe someone here can enlighten me.

Here's a video of an Italian barista explaining:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJqT7TQodCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJqT7TQodCE)

  
EDITED to add:

The money quote:

>There are **many different drinks composed of milk and coffee:** flat white, latte, cortado, macchiato. All of them are similar... You will taste a liquid flat drink **with some foam on its top**. And then there is the Italian cappuccino. The Italian **cappuccino is a little bit different**... The difference is because **cappuccino is an homogeneous drink**. Cappuccino must be done with the perfect pouring. By pouring you will stir and **mix two stratified drinks into one homogeneous drink.** Only in this way will you call it an Italian cappuccino.

This, I think is the crux of the difference between the cappuccinos I had in Italy and the ones at Starbucks (and other American cafes). Maybe it's why customers sometimes complain?

In Italy, it's a homogeneous drink. The same frothy consistency from top to bottom. In America, there's a thin layer of foam on the top. In some cases it's almost been like washing the dishes with dish soap, when you have a bunch of soapy bubbles floating on top and pure dishwater below. Not homogeneous at all.

My question is, why? I looked at some Starbucks training videos, and to my ignorant, amateur eyes, it looks the same as what the Italian barista is doing.

Possibilities:

\* I'm missing something from the training videos and they're doing it differently than the Italians.

\* Baristas are not doing what is in the video

\* The shape of the paper cup doesn't let it mix properly like a porcelain cappuccino cup would.

\* Something else?

I know I've heard mention of some baristas simply scooping up some foam and putting it on top, which would seem to be completely against what the Italian barista is saying. Is that what's happening?

Just genuinely interested in what's going on and how I would ask the barista to make it the way I had it in Italy without sounding like an asshole.

------------------------------------------------------------

When you're out in nature, cooking can be one of the most enjoyable parts of your camping experience. With the right equipment, you can whip up delicious meals under the stars. Here‚Äôs a guide to essential equipment that can help you achieve the best camping cooking experiences.

### Portable Camping Stove

A portable camping stove is a must-have. It's compact, easy to set up, and allows you to cook meals no matter where you are. Look for a model that offers adjustable flame control, so you can simmer or boil depending on what you're preparing. Dual-burner stoves are particularly handy if you're cooking multiple dishes at once.

### High-Quality Cookware

Your cookware choice directly impacts your cooking experience. Consider lightweight and durable options that can handle various cooking methods. Cast iron pans are great for even heat distribution, while non-stick cookware is easy to clean and perfect for delicate foods.

Check Details: https://itrendworld.com/best-cooker  
  
- **Cast Iron Skillet:** Perfect for searing meats or making hearty breakfasts.
- **Collapsible Pot:** Saves space yet allows for boiling water or cooking meals.
- **Camping Kettle:** Essential for tea or instant coffee lovers.

### Cutting Board and Utensils

Every campsite chef needs a cutting board and utensils. Opt for a lightweight, durable cutting board that can double as a serving tray. Don't forget quality kitchen utensils, like a sharp knife and spatula. These items will make prep work seamless and enjoyable.

### Food Storage Containers

Proper food storage is key for keeping your ingredients fresh and safe. Choose airtight containers to protect your food from insects and dirt. A cooler can be a game-changer, especially for perishable items, and remember to pack ice packs to keep it cool.

Check Details: https://itrendworld.com/best-cooker  
  
### Portable Grill

If you love grilling, consider investing in a portable grill. These are often compact and easy to set up, allowing you to enjoy burgers, hot dogs, and veggies cooked to perfection over an open flame. Check that it's lightweight for easy transport.

### Campfire Cooking Tools

Cooking over a campfire adds a special flavor to your meals. Equip yourself with tools like:

Check Details: https://itrendworld.com/best-cooker  
  
- **Skewers:** Perfect for kabobs and marshmallows.
- **Cast Iron Dutch Oven:** Great for stews or bread baking.
- **Fire Pit Grill:** Provides a stable cooking surface.

### Portable Food Prep Table

Having a dedicated space for food prep makes cooking easier. A portable food prep table gives you room to cut, season, and plate your meals. Look for one that folds easily for storage and transport.

### Biodegradable Soap and Sponges

Cleaning up after cooking can be tedious, so bring biodegradable soap and sponges. This ensures your dishes get cleaned without harming the environment. A compact dish tub can also help manage the washing up process effectively.

Check Details: https://itrendworld.com/best-cooker  
  
### Lightweight Coolers and Ice Packs

While food storage containers are essential, a cooler takes it to the next level. Look for lightweight options that maintain a low temperature for as long as possible. Slipping in a few ice packs will keep your perishables fresh and inviting throughout your camping adventure.

### Spice and Seasoning Kits

No meal is complete without flavoring. Pack a small spice kit with your favorite seasonings. You could include items like salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a few dried herbs to elevate your dishes. Having spices handy can transform a simple meal into something memorable.

Check Details: https://itrendworld.com/best-cooker  
  
With these essential cooking items, you're set for an unforgettable camping experience. Not only can you enjoy delicious meals, but cooking outdoors will also bring you closer to nature. Remember to consider portability and ease of use when selecting your gear, and never forget the joy of cooking over a campfire! Happy camping and cooking!

My Grandfather he was a WW2 veteran who became wealthy practicing medicine after the war and had 5 children with the only woman he ever married, an ideal American man on the surface. But he was really a spineless careerist I realize looking back on the choices he made as he aged. He claimed to be a devout Catholic but married a Protestant. Catholic's are also against IVF, supposedly, but he was fine with my dad and mom choosing that procedure for my birth since my ""father"" (on paper only) was rendered impotent by testicular cancer as a young man. He was deployed against the Japanese in the War but was perfectly fine with my dad adopting my sister, who is Asian. He's always supported my cousin who was born crippled, missing his right hand since birth. My other cousin is almost certainly a closeted Gay. He was obsessed with building an ideal muscular physique, claiming it was so he could be better at Football. On the surface this is a laudable and classic pursuit for young American men, but this obsession became suspicious after he failed to make it on a College team. He got frosted blonde hair, earrings, and an artificial tan looking like a typical West Coast party boy when we was born, raised, and went to University in Maryland. After he got his silly Kinesiology Degree from University of Maryland he somehow got a huge amount of money to buy his own gym. Either the money came from his father (my Dermatologist uncle), my family was far more generous to him than they were to me, or, what I truly suspect, he became a favorite rentboy for wealthy gay men who laid a golden path for him. His family were a bunch of Libs too. Despite making so much money my uncle let my unemployed aunt run his household with an iron fist, which was all too apparent to me since most family gatherings happened at their house. One day when I was nearing Highschool graduation I mentioned how blatantly discriminatory College Affirmative Action is and this aunt railed against me calling me a racist who must be getting brainwashed somewhere. The American Conservative supposedly wants to conserve the very best of American heritage, yet my so-called ""conservative"" grandfather let his family become a freak show of yellow asskissing imported Americans, the ""differently abled"", the queer-coded and diversity & tolerance set.

Because my family pressured me to be a spineless, feckless, neoliberal ""tolerant"" coward of a man I never found the courage to openly stand for my beliefs. But deep down I always knew America was and would be better for me without the ""diversity"" the Libs have to offer. I feel inspired by the adversity and sabotage and dirty tricks Trump had to overcome to get elected and he is a President that inspires me for the first time in my adulthood. I want to prove I'm committed to MAGA, but am not 100% sure where to start. I still live in Maryland and much of the local culture is still infested by Libs since almost every black person in majority-black Baltimore is a Democrat and pretty much every organization is obligated to let them participate to not be ""racist"". Of course these same blacks who go on and on about ""tolerance"" don't mind discouraging me from inclusion through social bullying and even subtle threats. I thought about joining the Mormon church as they have a presence in my area and not many blacks feel the need to try infiltrating their congregation. I have never used drugs or even drank liquor on a regular basis so I figure I already have the ""hard"" parts of following a Mormon lifestyle mastered! There's also an obnoxious Alt-Leftist coffee shop at a run down shopping strip near me. They got posters up for every pet Leftist cause you can imagine from River to Sea Free Gaza to Free Plan B & Abortion for All Women! The sorts who work there are exactly who you would imagine, and they say its a ""Worker-Owned Cooperative"" so obviously they're all down with the ""message"" rather than just poor schmucks who need any paycheck they can get. When I look through their windows and see the smug shitbags with their face piercings and tattoos laughing it up in between dainty sips of their gay lattes it MAKES ME WANT TO DO SOMETHING!

1gr9emi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Beastpreneur/comments/1gr9emi/my_review_of_decentralized_masters/,"My Review Of ""Decentralized Masters""","Salim Elhila lives a life that many dream about. Based in Dubai, he spends his days wakeboarding, DJing, and practicing kickboxing in his luxury condo, all while enjoying panoramic views of the city. Salim describes himself as a math engineer turned entrepreneur, building businesses with a particular focus on finance. He and his business partner, Tan Gera, an ex-Wall Street investment banker, co-founded *Decentralized Masters*, a company that teaches individuals how to grow their wealth using decentralized finance, or DeFi.

**You're here because you're looking for a way to make money.**¬†[Here's a link](https://www.twopagesites.com/beastpreneur-page?sl=beast)¬†**to another business model you should consider. I rent leads to business owners for monthly recurring income. You can**¬†[watch a video about it¬†here](https://www.twopagesites.com/beastpreneur-page?sl=beast)**.**

[Go here to see my no.1 recommendation!](https://www.twopagesites.com/beastpreneur-page?sl=beast)

Tan left a secure six-figure Wall Street career to dive into the world of DeFi, a sector he says offers a huge return potential. Now, Tan reportedly makes daily profits in the range of $6,000 to $17,000 with minimal effort ‚Äì just a few clicks, he claims. According to Tan and Salim, this is possible through DeFi, a relatively new financial ecosystem that aims to create a banking alternative by using blockchain technology.

# The Appeal of Decentralized Masters

Tan and Salim‚Äôs DeFi strategies are based on a $250 billion industry that they say remains largely untapped, with only 0.02% of people worldwide actively participating. Rather than keeping this knowledge to themselves, they are marketing their strategies through Decentralized Masters to teach others how to benefit from DeFi. Salim claims that even billionaires use similar methods to amplify their wealth, avoiding traditional investments while generating returns that can exceed 400%.

In DeFi, investors don‚Äôt have to worry about timing the market or navigating complex financial tools. Instead, Decentralized Masters teaches a ‚Äúcopy-and-paste‚Äù method to get started. Users follow a straightforward process to generate returns passively, and, according to Salim, they don‚Äôt need to be experts or dedicate a lot of time.

[Go here to see my no.1 recommendation!](https://www.twopagesites.com/beastpreneur-page?sl=beast)

# How Decentralized Masters Works

The concept behind Decentralized Masters relies on a few key components of DeFi:

1. **Stablecoins** ‚Äì These are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset, often the U.S. dollar, which helps reduce the volatility commonly seen in the crypto market.
2. **Liquidity Pools** ‚Äì Investors place their stablecoins in pools where other DeFi users can borrow them, generating interest income for the lender.
3. **Smart Contracts** ‚Äì DeFi operates on smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts on the blockchain. These are said to secure investments by automating transactions, supposedly minimizing risk.

According to Salim, this setup allows users to earn substantial interest, sometimes as high as 78% on ‚Äúslow‚Äù days and even higher returns with strategic placements. He notes that making these deposits and collecting returns takes little time, similar to the time needed to brew a cup of coffee.

[Go here to see my no.1 recommendation!](https://www.twopagesites.com/beastpreneur-page?sl=beast)

# Why DeFi?

Salim argues that DeFi offers benefits that traditional investments, like stocks, can‚Äôt match. For example, a $100,000 investment in stocks might grow to $147,000 over five years, and inflation could still reduce real gains. Meanwhile, Salim and Tan claim that Decentralized Masters‚Äô approach could potentially multiply that same investment many times over, thanks to high DeFi returns. DeFi also operates independently from traditional finance, giving investors a way to earn more without relying on the banking system.

# The Downsides of DeFi and Crypto

While DeFi promises high returns, it‚Äôs also known for risks. Hacks, scams, and ‚Äúrug pulls‚Äù (where project creators disappear with investors‚Äô money) have occurred in the crypto space. The Decentralized Masters program positions itself as safe, highlighting smart contracts that secure transactions. However, those familiar with the industry know that DeFi can be risky, and the notion of ‚Äúsafe returns‚Äù may sound overly optimistic.

Salim and Tan aim to address these risks by offering their structured approach to DeFi, which they say minimizes these concerns. However, some potential customers remain skeptical, questioning whether they can trust an unregulated field. Additionally, joining Decentralized Masters comes at a high price, according to discussions on Reddit, which could deter individuals with smaller budgets.

# How Decentralized Masters Markets Its Program

Decentralized Masters positions itself as an exclusive opportunity, tapping into a secret that the majority have overlooked. By sharing the methods that billionaires use, Salim and Tan aim to appeal to people looking for a reliable alternative to traditional investing. The allure of passive, high returns attracts those who are disillusioned with low stock market gains and the complexities of managing a portfolio.

For those who are new to DeFi, the program also offers a way to start without needing extensive technical knowledge. Salim and Tan claim that once users learn the fundamentals, they only need to copy and paste a few steps to start generating returns. This simplicity is a major selling point, as it reduces the perceived barrier to entry.

# Decentralized Finance in a Broader Context

While DeFi has the potential to change finance by decentralizing control and providing greater access to financial tools, the sector is still new and prone to fluctuations. Most crypto investors are familiar with the ‚Äúdegen‚Äù culture, where people buy volatile coins in the hopes of making quick profits, only to lose their money. DeFi aims to separate itself from this by offering stablecoin-based options with more predictable returns. However, the risks remain high, especially for those new to crypto and blockchain technology.

[Go here to see my no.1 recommendation!](https://www.twopagesites.com/beastpreneur-page?sl=beast)

# Conclusion

The concept behind Decentralized Masters is appealing: passive, high-yield investments that require minimal time and offer substantial returns. Salim and Tan present their program as a unique opportunity, backed by the emerging world of decentralized finance. They highlight the appeal of high returns, simplicity, and the promise of avoiding the pitfalls of traditional investments.

However, the program‚Äôs high cost, combined with the risks in DeFi, may cause potential customers to hesitate. Those familiar with the crypto industry understand the volatility and risk associated with DeFi and may question how secure these returns really are. Despite the promises of smart contracts and stablecoins, the risk of loss remains a possibility.

For investors interested in high returns with an appetite for risk, Decentralized Masters presents a chance to explore the potential of DeFi. But for those who are cautious or unfamiliar with crypto, this approach may seem too good to be true. Ultimately, Decentralized Masters offers a blend of high promise and high risk, with the potential for substantial gains but also a level of uncertainty that may not suit every investor.

# Rent Out Websites to Business Owners for Monthly Passive Income

[Renting out websites](https://www.twopagesites.com/beastpreneur-page?sl=beast)¬†is the best online business model I've found. Upfront work for long term passive income.

Here‚Äôs how it works: create a niche-specific website, rank it in a low competition market on Google, and auto-forward all the calls and leads to a business owner eager for more work.

Take, for example, a website like ""Junk Removal Austin."" Once you get it to rank on Google, anyone searching for junk removal services in Austin will find your site. The calls start rolling in, and your phone number software auto-transfers these potential customers to a business owner who‚Äôs hungry for more work and willing to pay you a monthly flat fee for the leads/calls.

You can rent out a site for anywhere from $500 to $3000 a month. The beauty of this model is that once a website ranks high on local search results, it tends to stay there, resulting in a consistent and sustainable source of passive income for years to come.

1. I want to open my own store.  
  
I used to be a barber of 7 years, but I was feeling a lot of pressure and wasn't handling myself very well due to lack of self confidence, which affected my ability to work and performance. The goal would be to open up a shop to have barbers/ hairdressers, along side that id like to sell  food, alcoholic beverages, coffee, clothes(vintage and new) vinyls etc, so the business isn't just solely dependent on source of income. I'd do a 70/30 rent a chair oppurtunity on the barbering and hair cutting as id want the people to make a comfortable living. am unsure of how id work the food/ coffee/ side of things but with a bit of research I reckon I could make it work. I could sell the clothes alcohol myself as I have experience in that department already. 

  
2. do I find a completely new job as the economy doesn't seem to be doing great  
  
ive been toying with  just leaving the shop idea as it seems to be a bit of a pipe dream and I need to able to live and move out, plus in the world today everyones struggling and the uncertainty of life and opening a shop could either be really good or just be terrible idea financially. 

im also unsure of what 'new career' I could do. ive applied to become a firefighter, retail work. I find it very difficult to be in an office environment and prefer a more hands on job, or maybe there's a job that I could be out and about and do office work?  ive looked at rope technician work, crime scene cleaning, working on oil rigs and im just struggling to find something id be good at. maybe some sort of marketing job or potentially public relations? im really not sure as to what I could do or where I would be good.

1gr98nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1gr98nt/san_jose_service_center_experience/,San Jose Service Center Experience,"I dropped off my Rivian recently for service at the San Jose service center. Everyone was super friendly, walked through all the issues I reported, offered a rental car or Uber credit. The guest lounge is well appointed, modern, and had snacks and coffee readily available. 

There were several hundred vehicles in the parking lot, that appeared to be a mix of new vehicles and those in service. The only negative thing I would have to say is that they said it would be about two weeks before they would start working on it. This was after waiting 90+ days for an appointment. I‚Äôd much rather my service date get pushed out another two weeks vs being without my vehicle which is still completely drive-able. 

I know it has been discussed, but this is a bad financial model with having to offer enterprise or uber credits and hopefully something they can get a handle on. 

The communication on the app was great and continues to be. ",2,1731603076.0,Rivian,1,0.75,False

Ninety minutes later, I actually sat with that chuple.
We shared coffee and talk and they had such good manners, and not long later came the retur to prime. open terror and violent death - which should never have reached into my contained and orderly life again: I already knew too much of such calamity

I bought her a meal because her credit card didn't work she never paid me back.

I once went out of my way to pick her up (she was in the opposite direction) to bring her to the city & she bought herself two coffees without offering one to me for the effort.

Another time I watched her dogs for a week and she never paid me, wrote a thank you.

I told her my mom had surgery-she made bread which she said I could give to my mom, but I had to pick it up, then she asked me to watch her dogs to top it off when she knew I was busy taking care of my mom.

This year I realized she's never stopped by any home I have lived in, but I have been the one to visit her.

When I talk to her she multi tasks and ignores me.

We went to a fair and she kept having me or my boyfriend hold things without saying please or thank you, I was just a coat rack basically.

Recently went through a super tough year, she lives 15 minutes away and all she could say was, ""I'll pray for you"". She never called, stopped by, sent a card. 

I am kind of tired of this one sided ""friendship"".

She's never called, sent a card, one of the many years I have known her she gave me a birthday gift.

She asks me to buy her products when she starts new things.

Then I wanted to make an animation in the beginning of this semester for an animation competition and asked him to make music for it, and he said yes, and since that moment there is literally no moment in our days when we don't talk (either in school or via text). This is how it began.

We eventually won the competition and traveled to a foreign country together, where we slept in one bed (nothing happened, just thought to mention it hehe). We really enjoyed it and we were talking nonstop, and since that journey we spend a lot of time together. I always go to his classroom where his group is and work there (he usually have classes when he I don't so he can't really come up to my classroom), and we make coffee together in the tea kitchen almost every weekday.  
We have a TON of inside jokes, we always hug each other when we meet, he even stands up from working when he sees me come in to hug me. Whenever we talk we always look into each other's eyes, and the most important and questionable part is that we make flirtatious jokes allllllll day long. For example: we were grocery shopping, and I knew what he wanted to get cuz he told me beforehand. He asked what else did I want to buy? So I told him that he wanted snacks, and he instantly answered that ""My snack is walking right beside me""  
Every single one of our classmates are shipping us and always ask us if we're together. I think I really started to like him but he's kind of shy like me so I have no idea if I should even make a move, which could ruin the friendship if he's not into me:(",1,1731602744.0,GirlTalk,1,1.0,False

I just have to get this off my chest because it was so annoying and happens at pretty much every coffee shop job I‚Äôve had. 

Got hired at a Dunkin about a year ago 
And from my first perspective everything seemed pretty ok. Besides how short the interview was. Anyway I got hired, and started working a week after. 

I noticed my SM/DM had the same last name as half the employees. Turns out it‚Äôs literally 50% of the girls family working there lol the other 40% was minors. Then there‚Äôs me the oldest person even there ( 26 ) the sm/dm was 21. 

Basically she let a lot of her family do whatever they wanted. They screamed at each other every shift the entire time ( made me very uncomfortable but they were family and it wasn‚Äôt complexity malicious) but if I was a customer and saw and heard what was happening behind bar I‚Äôd just walk out. 

Not to mention the way food and drinks had been made without a care if it‚Äôs even correct. 
Mainly because half the hires were literal children with the WORSE attitudes.
I was young at work once too I didn‚Äôt act like that üíÄ 

Some of the worst days I can remember was one day it was just me and this 17 year old girl.  It got really really busy ( night shift ) and I was dealing with front register. Drive through window. The DT speaker. Bar and oven all alone. I was very confused, I asked over and over on the headset where she was and couldn‚Äôt find her.  ( texted the store manager about it) then I ended up noticing the back room office door locked and closed??? So I told the sm that this girl legit locked her self in there ( which is highly unusual and against the rules) I knock and she‚Äôs like

Her: what??? 
Me: um we‚Äôre working? And it‚Äôs really busy why did you take your headset off? 
Her: I‚Äôm eating and on the phone ???? 
Me: ‚Ä¶. Well firstly you need to let me know if you‚Äôre gonna take a break and take your headset off? Please don‚Äôt leave me int he dark like that? Secondly why couldn‚Äôt you just let me know? Are you doing ok? What‚Äôs wrong 
Her: I‚Äôm fine. 
Me: ok‚Ä¶. So can you come and help it‚Äôs really busy and you‚Äôre on the clock??? 
Her: sure. After I‚Äôm done eating. 

GIRL?!?! WHAT. I literally rolled my eyes and just worked alone and the sm wrote her up and made her cry. Which wasn‚Äôt my intention but like. Why do that ?!?! Hellooooo?? 
 
I didn‚Äôt even like anyone at that store. 
I was told by the minors The sm would have them working alone without a key holder. Just two 16 year olds. ALONE at night?!?! IN A DUNKIN?! that place was always sketchy as hell. 

I made friends with ONE coworker. Simply because we closed together a lot. She was the only kid there that actually worked hard. 

All the others I worked with would decline orders and say we were out of things that we had. They would basically try to do whatever they wanted and even tried to guide me into doing the same. Which I did not. I would have to constantly tell them to stop saying we‚Äôre out of things we have. And I‚Äôd have to apologize so much to customers. And even then the customers were rude as hell too. I got so sick and tired of it I quit. I have so many more stories there and at Starbucks but that would = WAY too much venting.

How can I prove my Conservative Patriot cred?","My family were a bunch of RINOs on my dad's side which is where I spent most of my childhood after my parents divorced. My Grandfather he was a WW2 veteran who became wealthy practicing medicine after the war and had 5 children with the only woman he ever married, an ideal American man on the surface. But he was really a spineless careerist I realize looking back on the choices he made as he aged. He claimed to be a devout Catholic but married a Protestant. Catholic's are also against IVF, supposedly, but he was fine with my dad and mom choosing that procedure for my birth since my ""father"" (on paper only) was rendered impotent by testicular cancer as a young man. He was deployed against the Japanese in the War but was perfectly fine with my dad adopting my sister, who is Asian. He's always supported my cousin who was born crippled, missing his right hand since birth. My other cousin is almost certainly a closeted Gay. He was obsessed with building an ideal muscular physique, claiming it was so he could be better at Football. On the surface this is a laudable and classic pursuit for young American men, but this obsession became suspicious after he failed to make it on a College team. He got frosted blonde hair, earrings, and an artificial tan looking like a typical West Coast party boy when we was born, raised, and went to University in Maryland. After he got his silly Kinesiology Degree from University of Maryland he somehow got a huge amount of money to buy his own gym. Either the money came from his father (my Dermatologist uncle), my family was far more generous to him than they were to me, or, what I truly suspect, he became a favorite rentboy for wealthy gay men who laid a golden path for him. His family were a bunch of Libs too. Despite making so much money my uncle let my unemployed aunt run his household with an iron fist, which was all too apparent to me since most family gatherings happened at their house. One day when I was nearing Highschool graduation I mentioned how blatantly discriminatory College Affirmative Action is and this aunt railed against me calling me a racist who must be getting brainwashed somewhere. The American Conservative supposedly wants to conserve the very best of American heritage, yet my so-called ""conservative"" grandfather let his family become a freak show of yellow asskissing imported Americans, the ""differently abled"", the queer-coded and diversity & tolerance set.

Because my family pressured me to be a spineless, feckless, neoliberal ""tolerant"" coward of a man I never found the courage to openly stand for my beliefs. But deep down I always knew America was and would be better for me without the ""diversity"" the Libs have to offer. I feel inspired by the adversity and sabotage and dirty tricks Trump had to overcome to get elected and he is a President that inspires me for the first time in my adulthood. I want to prove I'm committed to MAGA, but am not 100% sure where to start. I still live in Maryland and much of the local culture is still infested by Libs since almost every black person in majority-black Baltimore is a Democrat and pretty much every organization is obligated to let them participate to not be ""racist"". Of course these same blacks who go on and on about ""tolerance"" don't mind discouraging me from inclusion through social bullying and even subtle threats. I thought about joining the Mormon church as they have a presence in my area and not many blacks feel the need to try infiltrating their congregation. I have never used drugs or even drank liquor on a regular basis so I figure I already have the ""hard"" parts of following a Mormon lifestyle mastered! There's also an obnoxious Alt-Leftist coffee shop at a run down shopping strip near me. They got posters up for every pet Leftist cause you can imagine from River to Sea Free Gaza to Free Plan B & Abortion for All Women! The sorts who work there are exactly who you would imagine, and they say its a ""Worker-Owned Cooperative"" so obviously they're all down with the ""message"" rather than just poor schmucks who need any paycheck they can get. When I look through their windows and see the smug shitbags with their face piercings and tattoos laughing it up in between dainty sips of their gay lattes it MAKES ME WANT TO DO SOMETHING! Would doing something give me real Conservative MAGA cred? The Q Shaman got some cred as far as I can tell for his brave displays at DC, hoping I can get something like that going on a local level at least.

Sometimes id go to the hospital sometimes id lay in my shower with cold water running on me. Im the kinda girl whose faith in the healthcare system is nonexistent i always get disappointed with how drs treat me. In turn i end up having so much anxiety when it comes to drs. One time i had a seizure and pissed myself and was wheeled into the hospital hallway and left to sit in my pissy clothes for hours no one checked on me and i was in the HALLWAY. Any ways i was on keppra (couple years ago) which i took for about 2 weeks before i realized it made me super suicidal/ a raging bitch so i just quit. I was also paranoid i wouldnt get a refill because appointments are just a bitch to get and thought the withdrawals would just bring on more seizures than i normally get. So i had been med free for about two years till two days ago. I was at work in a coffee shop i felt great it was the morning rush and i was stocking things up and outta no where i had tunnel vision and a sense of panic and it had felt like i swallowed my chest. It felt so familiar i tried to sit down and that was it, lights out. Tbh i don‚Äôt even remember if i made it to the floor before i passed out but i do remember waking up with a big ass cop (who was in the shop getting coffee with about 4 other cops and 4 other fire men) in my face screaming my name. I was laying there in my own piss just apologizing to everyone cos the look of fear on everyone else‚Äôs face just makes me feel bad lol. The fire men rushed to me and did some vitals and pricked my thumb to check my blood sugar and rushed me to the er. The dr in the er gave me lacosamide and although im really paranoid about taking it and what itll do to me i havent missed a dose yet and dont plan too. I say this because usually i have about 5 minutes of panic knowing im about to have a seizure i have panic attacks but this time was so fast and no warning signs. I didnt feel bad up until ten seconds before i blacked out. Now i feel like i cant do anything and feel super paranoid and just filled with intense anxiety. I went to the coffee shop i always go to and had a panic attack i had to get up and leave. Im taking time away from work but i just dont know how ill go back without panicking?? Idk if that makes sense but that seizure scared the living shit outta me. I have an overwhelming sense of dread.

1gr8otg,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gr8otg/the_rabbit_box/,The Rabbit Box,"When I was six years old, my mother sent me to stay with my grandparents for the summer.

At this time in my life, I had never met my mother's parents, and I had never been away from home longer than a weekend. When my mom broke the news to me that I would be going away for nearly two months, I sobbed on and off for several days. It wasn't until she told me that my grandparents had a dog that I began to feel some excitement about leaving home.

Kindergarten was ending, and on the last day, I joined the class on the rainbow-colored carpet where we were prompted by our teacher, Ms. Hayne, to share something we had planned for summer break. Ms. Hayne was a young teacher, in her second or third year at the school whose voice was sweet and soft. When it was my turn to share, I proudly exclaimed that I would be spending the summer at my grandparents‚Äôs house. I made sure to mention the dog. My peers giggled and shouted at the mention of the animal, and that helped me to adjust to the idea of leaving even more.

It felt like some sort of adventure. Still, the day came, and I trembled with nerves in the back seat of my mom‚Äôs Honda as she drove me several hours away from home and toward the unknown. The road seemed to be unending, and the wide city street eventually narrowed into a poorly maintained stretch of asphalt that dug deep into a wooded mountain.

‚ÄúWhere are the other cars?‚Äù I asked my mother as I peered around checking each window. ‚ÄúNot many people come up this way. Grandma and Grandpa like their privacy, so they moved up here back before you were born.‚Äù Sensing my uneasiness she added, ‚ÄúDont worry honey. You are going to have so much space to run around and explore. It's going to be a good change of pace for you.‚Äù I shuffled in my seat and fell quiet. I did like the idea of exploring outside. My mom and I lived on the second floor of an old apartment building. There were some neighbor kids with whom I spent most of my free time, but finding something to do other than coloring or building Legos was difficult since none of us were allowed to play outside. Too many strangers and moving cars.

It wasn't the worst neighborhood, but it wasn't the kind of place where you let your kids roam free. There was always an adult watching us when we would venture out to play on the basketball court, where we would usually just end up playing freeze tag. That ten-by-twenty cement pad contained the majority of my outdoor experience. It would be nice to have some freedom to run wild, catch bugs, and climb trees.

The road trailed on and the foliage seemed to grow all-encompassing, almost swallowing the small road in some areas. As branches stretched over the skies the shadows paved the street in shapes all too frightening for a child with an active imagination. I chose to keep my view centered on the seat in front of me. We drove all day, and when the sun had set we finally pulled onto a dirt road. We continued for at least another mile before a large house came into view behind the trees.

As we slowly inched the car closer the fauna opened up into a clearing, and the whole property was visible. Near the main house was a barn that looked as though it used to be painted red, but was now chipped away revealing mostly brown and white wood. As we rounded the house to the back where my mom parked the car a small shed appeared.

‚ÄúAlright. We‚Äôre here!‚Äù my mom shouted with more relief than enthusiasm. I kept my seat belt on, hoping that if I waited long enough my mother would decide this whole thing had been a mistake and turn the car around. Instead, she removed her keys, killing the radio that was softly humming static, and opened her door. I followed my mom's lead, not wanting to remain alone in the car. Stepping out of the vehicle I was hit with a light gust of wind that chilled my small bones and made me grimace. I looked at my mom, and she could see how tense I was.

Grabbing my hand she led me around to the side door and knocked. I clutched her hand in mine as we waited for the door to swing open. After a moment, creaking footsteps approached, and the hinges of the door squeaked to reveal a tender aged face. My grandmother stood in the doorway with a soft smile and warm eyes ushering us in with her free hand, the other clutching a plate of cookies. ‚ÄúCome in!‚Äù she squealed.

I looked at my mother who wore the same soft smile on her own face. We walked in and the door was shut behind us. The warmth my grandmother exuded did a decent job of melting my fears, but the atmosphere of the home was quick to send the chills back down my spine. All of the lights were off. Only the moonlight shining in through the entryway window illuminated my surroundings. ‚ÄúOh excuse me one moment.‚Äù my grandmother said as she placed the tray of cookies on the coffee table and rushed to turn on a lamp.

When the small, solitary light source was flipped on the house was left looking eerie. My mom began catching up with my grandma. The two had talked over the phone several times over the years, but this was the first time they had been in the same room since I was born. They sat on the couch as my mom complained about the drive and my grandmother tried to force-feed her oatmeal raisin cookies. Noticing my shyness my mom excused me to explore the house. ‚ÄúYour room is upstairs to the right,‚Äù Grandma said. I picked up my bag, slung it over my shoulders, and headed towards the staircase. As I ascended I made sure to count each stair, a habit that I have yet to break even in my adulthood. I reached the top.

14 steps.

I glanced to my right, seeing that the hallway led to a small bedroom and a bathroom adjacent to it. I peered to the left out of curiosity and let out an involuntary scream. Down the left hallway was my grandfather, a man wholly unfamiliar to me, standing in the doorway. His silhouette was outlined by the shining light behind him, creating a specter in my young imagination.

My mother rushed up the stairs when she heard me and frantically asked what was wrong. Frozen in fear, I stammered for the words. ‚ÄúTh..the‚Ä¶man‚Ä¶‚Äù I pointed down the hall. Grandpa had turned his back and began walking into the master bedroom, shutting the door behind him without a word. ‚ÄúOh don't you mind him,‚Äù Grandma said as she reached the 14th step. ‚ÄúHe's been feeling under the weather. He hopes to make an appearance tomorrow after he's gotten some rest.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I plan on leaving kind of early tomorrow. I have to get back for some meetings at work.‚Äù Mom said. ‚ÄúTrust me,‚Äù Grandma replied, ‚ÄúNo one gets up earlier than Grandpa.‚Äù

The next morning I got up early to say goodbye to my mom. Up until this point I had been the only one with visible hesitation, but she seemed to linger longer than expected, looking into my eyes and showering me with kisses and I-love-yous. I wish I could have stayed in that moment forever. True to my grandmother‚Äôs words, my grandfather had gotten up before anyone but chose to spend the morning hunting. This was irritating to my mother, but she really did have responsibilities at work to return to, so she eventually got into the driver‚Äôs seat of her car and rounded the house heading for the main road.

I waved goodbye and watched her car until it dipped past the clearing and was absorbed by the tree line. With the vehicle out of sight, my fate was sealed. I would be spending almost two full months in this foreign place. ‚ÄúCome on inside. We can have some breakfast together.‚Äù said my grandmother.

The rest of the morning was fairly normal. I ate eggs and bacon, colored a picture, and even got to spend some time watching cartoons on the old TV in the living room. It was the kind that had the antennas at the top, and I didn't get any of the normal channels but I eventually found an animated show and sat back to enjoy the story. That morning I had also gotten to know grandma‚Äôs dog Buffalo, who had gotten used to my presence and was lying next to me on the couch.

Everything changed when my grandfather returned home from hunting. Though I was in the living room, I immediately tuned in to his arrival as he threw the front door open and yelled out to my grandma. I stayed seated on the couch, but I could hear her greeting him at the door. Her demeanor was drastically different from then on. Instead of the bubbly, cheerful woman I had met the night before, she became a fearful shell when he was around.

Grandpa mumbled something about having lunch ready by the time he returned from the basement. Dragging two lifeless rabbits at his side, my grandfather walked to the basement door and stopped. He turned to me and said, ‚ÄúDont you go snooping around my basement, you hear me, kid?‚Äù I nodded, and he descended the stairs closing the door behind him. ‚ÄúWhat's in the basement?‚Äù I asked turning to Grandma. ‚ÄúThat's where your grandpa does his work. He sells the rabbit meat and skins, and he uses the downstairs area to clean and prepare them.‚Äù

I didn't like the idea of dead rabbits in the house. In my innocent mind, I could only feel sadness for the creatures, and even a little fear. I had never seen a dead thing before. A curiosity about the rabbits started to grow within me. Not the blood and guts part. I wasn't old enough to understand that. But the idea of something being alive and then just‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶not being alive anymore was sort of fascinating in a morbid way. I knew then that I had to get a closer look at the rabbits. I wish that I hadn't. Maybe if I had followed the rules and stayed out of that basement, none of this would have happened to me.

A few days passed, and the routine became clear. Every morning, Grandpa would go rabbit hunting. And every day a little after breakfast he would return home with 2 to 5 rabbits strung up by their legs. I remember that, even as a child, it was odd to me that I never saw any meat or skins returning with Grandfather when he would come back upstairs. Wasn't he selling them? They surely can't just still be sitting in the basement‚Ä¶could they? It was hard to come to any conclusions, especially because Grandpa hardly ever talked to me or even acknowledged my existence.

Grandmother was silent. I quickly became aware that the happy talkative personality I had seen when we first arrived had been a facade, hiding the real grandma. In reality, she was timid, quiet, and kept to herself most days. She only really spoke to me about when a meal was prepared, or when it was time to go to sleep. Other than those times, she stayed in her room. I was too young to realize that I was being neglected, but I understood that something about this situation was wrong.

Left to fend for myself most of the day, I spent my time exploring the woods with Buffalo. He was a good dog and stayed close to me even without a leash. Though he was a coward most of the time, he seemed to be very protective of me and would often jump in front of me to warn me of ledges, streams, or animal dens. I grew to love that dog. One day while I was at the edge of the tree line about to go exploring I noticed my grandfather getting into his truck and driving off the property. I was about to continue on my expedition when a thought crossed my mind.

This is the perfect time to see the rabbits in the basement.

With my grandpa out of the house, I figured I could sneak downstairs, take a quick peek, and be back upstairs before anyone noticed. Grandmother would be in her room until dinner time, and even without knowing where Grandfather went, I estimated I had at least a few minutes. Maybe more. I turned back and headed inside. Once inside I did a brief check to make sure my grandmother wasn't wandering about. Just as I thought she would be, she was shut up in her bedroom.

It was almost too perfect. I stepped over to the basement door, making sure to tiptoe in case my footsteps alerted her. When I reached the door I was surprised to find it unlocked. They were making this too easy. I opened the door slowly, attempting to minimize the creaking that all the house doors emitted. Looking down the steps, I took in the darkness. ‚ÄúStay here boy,‚Äù I said to Buffalo. If there was raw rabbit meat down there, I didn't want him getting into it and blowing my cover.

I began my slow descent, counting the stairs. Reaching the bottom, I muttered,

‚Äú12‚Äù,

under my breath. I looked around for a light switch and had to feel the walls with my hands until I found what I was looking for and flicked it up. The small bulb illuminated the room in a dim yellow shade. I was starting to feel a little creeped out, and for a second thought to turn back, until I noticed a door on the other side of the room. I figured that must be where Grandpa kept the rabbit remains.

Inching forward I reached out for the handle, but before I could turn the knob I was caught off guard by a loud booming voice. ‚ÄúSo!‚Äù my Grandfather shouted from behind me. ‚ÄúYou want to see what I keep in the old storage closet do ya kid?‚Äù I quickly turned to face him, my blood running cold. He had a smile on his face, but he didn't seem to be happy at all. There was malice in his eyes.

‚ÄúI'm sorry Grandpa I'll go back upstairs,‚Äù I said timidly. He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo. You want to see what's inside. And I want to show you.‚Äù Fear froze me in my tracks. I couldn't say anything as he walked closer and reached out for the handle to the door. When he opened it a feeling of uneasy confusion washed over me. It was a closet, about 3 feet in width and 4 feet in length. The only thing inside was a wooden chest. It was dark brown and had a large round lock on it.

The chest was big, taking up most of the space in the closet. I didn't understand what he was trying to show me. Grandpa fished into his pocket and pulled out a key. ‚ÄúLet's take a look inside, shall we?‚Äù He said. I was still frozen in place. I no longer wanted to see what was inside, but I hoped he would open it quickly so we could get the ordeal over with and move on to my inevitable punishment. Kneeling down, he unlocked the chest and motioned for me to open it. Hesitantly, I grabbed the edges of the lid and lifted the top.

Before I had a chance to recognize the contents of the box I was grabbed from behind. Kicking and screaming I begged to be let go, but I was too small and weak to fight against him. He shoved me forcefully into the chest and slammed the lid shut. I continued to scream, and from outside the box, I could hear the old man howling with laughter. ‚ÄúMaybe this will teach you not to go snooping in other people's business!‚Äù he bellowed. I pushed up on the top of the box but it didn't budge. The monster had locked it.

Through my tears, I listened as his footsteps walked away. I heard him climb the stairs and shut the basement door as he exited. After a few more moments of crying, I assessed the contents of the chest. It was too dark to see clearly. The chest had small, almost unnoticeable gaps along the seams in the edges, and being in a closet there wasn't much light available to seep through.

When put into dark spaces the pupils dilate in order to capture as many photons as possible. It takes time, but as long as there is a small trace of light, the eyes will adjust to it to the best of their abilities. When my young eyes eventually captured the small hint of visibility I was afforded within the box, I began to scream again. With me in the old wooden chest were the remains of a half dozen or so rabbits. Soft fur mixed with sticky congealed blood hugged me from every angle.¬†

I am not sure how long I was left in the box. It must have been hours because eventually when my grandfather returned to let me out the sky was dark and it was time for bed. Everything changed after that night. I was still afforded the liberty of roaming the house and forest during the day, but at night I was always led downstairs, where my grandfather would put me in the box, and I would spend the night there.

In the mornings when he would go hunting, he would let me out and take me hunting with him. My job was the carry the rabbits after he had shot them. After breakfast, he would show me how to remove the bones. These were his real trophies. With twine and sticks, he would bind them together to form symbols. Sigils of sorts I guess. He was always vague about what they were meant for, but he believed they held the power to ward off evil. The kind of evil was never specified.

After crafting the symbols we would walk around the forest and hang them on trees. The bloodied coats were placed into the chest. He claimed they held special importance as well, but never told me what he did with them. When the chest was filled with nine skins he would take them out to his truck and drive away with them. Maybe he was selling them, but the way he talked about them made it seem as though they held sacred powers as well. I guess I'll never know for sure what he did with them. Eventually, the summer ended, and I went back to live with my mother once more. I never saw either of my grandparents again.¬†

That brings me to why I am writing this. Many years have passed since that summer at the farm. I buried my trauma, and despite all odds, I've actually grown up to be pretty successful. I'm a social worker who specializes in neglected children‚Äôs cases. I live a humble, quiet life, and it suits me.

But the other day, out of the blue, I received a call from an executor of my grandfather‚Äôs will. I guess the old man finally kicked the bucket. Apparently, he had left me something, too. I was hesitant to accept a meeting with the representative at first. I didn't really need or want the man‚Äôs money, or whatever he left me. But I decided to go anyway, at least to placate my curiosity.

We met in a law building filled to the brim with men and women in suits looking far too busy. My job has its own fair share of hustle, paperwork, and long days, so I could sympathize with the people milling about me. The conference room was on the second floor. I scaled to the top and paused.

12 stairs.

When we entered the conference room I was asked to sit down, look over a few papers, and sign them. Skimming the documents I grew confused and asked for clarification about the itemized inheritance. Under my name, there was a number one. ‚ÄúExcuse me, what does this one next to my name mean?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThat's the amount of items left for you specifically by your grandfather in the will.‚Äù the representative explained. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶what is it? What did he leave me?‚Äù¬†

He turned to the closet in the conference room and fished out a key from his pocket. When he opened the door, lying on the floor was a large, dark brown, wooden chest.",1,1731601639.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I have had basically the same dream twice in the last few weeks. I wake up in bed, SO is in the bathroom, and SD11 crawls into bed next to me. She asks if she can and I say no, or she just crawls in. SO comes out and doesn‚Äôt notice or says ‚Äúaw look at you guys.‚Äù

To be clear, SD does not sleep in our bed, I put an end to that pretty early on. Though sometimes I suspect she naps in there and watches TV when I‚Äôm gone. I‚Äôve tried creating boundaries around our room. I WFH and have a chronic health condition‚Ä¶I feel like I‚Äôve lost control over the entire house (including my office which is right off the stairwell and the increased foot traffic makes it hard to focus). We live in a super, super remote area ‚Äî so coffee shops/coworking spaces/renting space elsewhere is not an option. Summer was a nightmare, and so is every day she is off school. 

But it‚Äôs not just my house being a Petri dish and losing my workspace. SD wears SO‚Äôs clothing, uses his bath towel (I‚Äôve realized that insisting on separate towels for separate bodies is not as universal as I thought!?) treats our bedroom like an extension of the common areas of the house, and he is always at her beck and call. Every day she comes home from school and tells her dad what she wants to do for the evening and they do it. Same for the weekends. 

Meanwhile, 7mos into having her full-time, we NEVER have those conversations together. There‚Äôs no carving out time for us, there‚Äôs no weekend planning with my partner‚Ä¶just him telling me what he and his daughter have on deck and an invite to join them.

I am currently the only one working, tho SO has always worked these 6yrs we‚Äôve been together.  I realize she is a child and her needs come first. I realize this is a massive change for everyone and it will take time to adjust. I realize that SD needs love and support after a stressful life with an unstable addict BM. 

But the selfish part of me is frustrated that I feel more like the child in the family system and they are the adults. I feel like they are always telling me what we are doing or eating or watching, where we are going, who we are seeing. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I am retracting into myself because I resent feeling such little control over my life and the loss of my relationship. I take lots of long drives by myself, or just find somewhere secluded and sit in my car. Then I get accused of not wanting to be part of the family. Talking to SO about it, he either feels guilty (but nothing changes) or gets defensive, depending on the day. 

And I do participate in ‚Äî and have planned ‚Äî family activities, but recently I was find them less and less enjoyable. The less I have with my SO the more depressed I get and then I just don‚Äôt feel like slapping on a smile for family time. It‚Äôs at the point where I work two jobs all week, it‚Äôs cold out and I just want to be alone all weekend anyway. 

Anyway, if you made it this far, thank you for coming to my pity party. I would love any willing commiseration‚Ä¶",2,1731601522.0,stepparents,5,0.67,False
1gr8n04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1gr8n04/1_carat_diamond_guide_expert_tips_for_smart_buying/,1 Carat Diamond Guide: Expert Tips for Smart Buying,"A 1.00 carat diamond measures 6.4mm in diameter and costs between $1,200 and $17,000, with the average U.S. buyer spending $6,200. Market data shows this size remains the standard for engagement rings, representing 49% of all diamond purchases in this category.

Lab-grown alternatives offer identical specifications at 70% lower prices, ranging from $500 to $2,000 for a one carat stone. Recent trends indicate a significant shift, with 35% (some say even more)¬† of buyers now choosing lab-grown diamonds at this carat weight and larger.

This guide provides detailed comparisons between natural and lab-grown options, specific price breakdowns by quality grades, and expert strategies for maximizing value at the coveted one-carat mark.



# Bottom Line

When it comes to selecting a 1 carat diamond, understanding both its symbolic weight and practical considerations is essential for making an informed purchase. Here are the key takeaways:

* A 1 carat diamond strikes an ideal balance between size and manageability, making it a popular choice for engagement rings.
* Quality factors beyond carat weight, particularly cut, significantly impact a diamond's beauty and price.
* Natural 1 carat diamonds typically range from $1,200 to $17,000 depending on the overall grades, while lab-grown alternatives offer substantial savings.
* Different diamond shapes can appear larger or smaller at the same carat weight due to varying dimensions.
* The versatility of 1 carat diamonds allows for a wide range of setting options to suit personal style
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers like James Allen, Blue Nile and Whiteflash, which provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

I am hoping to seek some advice from my colleagues on what course of action I should take and get some other perspectives.  
  
I currently and have been working a clinical job for the past 3 months. In that time I've done quite a lot of workups for ophthalmology clinic. However, it is still not what I first expected of the job. I consistently feel overwhelmed by the tasks presented, despite dedicating evenings towards study material. Plenty of equipment I still feel unfamiliar with, and it doesn't help that instead of 1 primary work location I have been floating to 4 different workplaces and 6 different doctors throughout the week. Even with the flashcards to memorize everyones preferences and quirks it still is not enough. I have been keeping it in me but recently I admitted to myself that I genuinely despise this job even if it relates to my dream field.  
  
At this point I have begun feeling out some applications to local coffee shops as I'd really prefer to just do some little job instead of contending with the stress of clinic. Not saying that barista is any easier, but there's less consequences for screwing up a workup, less people to potentially piss off, less consequences if we get backed up, etc. etc.  
  
I recognize that 'quitting' a clinical job typically isn't a good look and that burnout is not a well accepted excuse considering that healthcare across the board is pretty similar. On top of that, I still have not received further II and no confirmed acceptances. However, I also recognize the importance of mental health, and I'd like to spend my days without wishing I was rather oofed then dreading going into clinic. Perhaps I could keep working until I secure the A but right now I hate myself.  
  
Looking for any sort of helpful comments or advice to steer me in a direction. At this point I've accumlated 600+ extra clinical hours and thinking maybe i can rephrase this as pursuring a passion hobby when an alternative job opportunity came up (which I mean is true, and I would like to delve into this hobby much much more).",4,1731601107.0,premed,1,1.0,False

I have an ex of 4 years - both of us 26 years old. I thought I was going to marry this girl, still do. About 2 years ago she started telling me about she had always had this dream to get a masters degree abroad. I loved her to pieces and was always as supportive and helpful as I could be. She even acknowledged that she never would‚Äôve gotten accepted without me. She left a few months ago and we were going to break up but decided to stay together. Of course 2 weeks later we broke up - initiated by me but to address that she was being distant and unsure - we mutually agreed to end things for now but I was devastated. We agreed to keep our Snapchat streak and keep each others locations (so hard not to check). She also said she would reach out ‚Äúsoon‚Äù it‚Äôs been 63 days. When we broke up we set certain boundaries. Most importantly no sleeping with anyone else if you may want to get back together and if you decide you don‚Äôt want to get back together let the other person know right away so no one is waiting. I have muted her on Instagram and she has muted me. I was still looking at her profile but the things she was posting and doing were very hurtful and disrespectful. Clubbing until 6am, out with new guys and groups of people all the time, posting from coffee shops with guys, making all these new friends and connections‚Ä¶ etc etc just seems really disrespectful especially with how amazing I‚Äôve been towards her and her family.

Now here‚Äôs the real reason I‚Äôm posting this - when we last spoke i told her that if anything happened to her sick grandparents I‚Äôd want to know. She said she would tell me. Well 2 days ago her grandmother passed away and the funeral is tomorrow. I know from a mutual friend that she will not be flying in for the funeral. I still have some level of relationship with her family and honestly i don‚Äôt know if they even knew we were together or that we broke up - she had a tough relationship with her parents and didn‚Äôt share much with them. They may have thought i was the guy friend who was always around. Anyway - her parents still interact with my Instagram posts and stories, as does her aunt, they also text me from time to time. My ex and I have not spoken in 2 months, she said she would. She did not reach out to me about her grandmother, she said she would.

I‚Äôve reached out to her dad and offered my condolences for his mother. I have not reached out to her and I‚Äôm not sure that I should. I would also like to attend the funeral tomorrow but I‚Äôm not sure if I should. On the one hand it may be innapropriate and awkward on the other hand it could be the right thing to do. I wasn‚Äôt super close with the deceased but this woman had opened her home to me, i had slept there, spent summers in her pool, eaten food that she paid for. I feel like i should go but it‚Äôs a tough one and especially with my ex and i not speaking and her not going to be there i really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the right thing to do. I also don‚Äôt want to look like a dick for not texting her or not going but she said she would text me and she didn‚Äôt - probably doesn‚Äôt want to hear from me, right?",1,1731600985.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

So I thought it would be more memorable and easier to remember things if I learned a lot of it in an entertatining way. So I drafted this prompt:

  
As a senior genius 100x software engineer can you explain all of this code to me in an entertaining way while you are telling funny stories about how you have learned this stuff: 

    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Text;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    
    namespace Giraffe { 
    internal class Program {
     static void Main(string[] args) {
    Console.WriteLine(""Hello World""); 
    Console.ReadLine(); 
    } 
    } 
    }

  
This is what I got:

Ah, the classic ""Hello World"" program in C#! Brings back memories of my early days when I thought naming my namespaces after animals would make debugging more fun. Spoiler alert: it did, until I had to explain to my boss why our finance module was under \`namespace Platypus\`.



Let's dive into this code gem you've got here:



    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Text;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;



These \`using\` directives are like the VIP passes to the .NET club. You're telling your program, ""Hey, I might need some fancy functionalities from these namespaces, so keep them on speed dial."" Though, between you and me, including \`System.Collections.Generic\`, \`System.Linq\`, \`System.Text\`, and \`System.Threading.Tasks\` in a ""Hello World"" program is like bringing a Swiss army knife to butter your toast. But who am I to judge? Once, I included the entire \`System.Drawing\` namespace just to change the color of my console text. Ended up creating a rainbow text generator that crashed if you ran it on a Monday. Good times.



Next up:

    namespace Giraffe
    {
        internal class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(""Hello World"");
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
        }
    }



Ah, \`namespace Giraffe\`! Nothing screams ""We're reaching new heights!"" like naming your namespace after the tallest land animal. I remember when I named my namespaces after fruits. The \`namespace Banana\` had a slippery slope of bugs, and \`namespace Apple\` kept getting into trademark disputes.



Inside our towering \`Giraffe\`, we've got an \`internal class Program\`. The \`internal\` keyword means that this class is accessible only within its own assembly. It's like having a secret clubhouse where only certain code friends are allowed. I once made all my classes public and ended up with a codebase so entangled that even the spiders in my code editor gave up weaving their webs.



Now, the heart of the program:

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Hello World"");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }



The \`Main\` method is the entry point of every C# console application. It's the front door where the execution starts. Making it \`static\` means we don't need to instantiate the \`Program\` class to use this method. It's like having a universal remote that works without batteries‚Äîpure magic.



Inside \`Main\`, we have \`Console.WriteLine(""Hello World"");\`, which outputs the string ""Hello World"" to the console. It's the rite of passage for every programmer. Fun fact: the first time I ran a ""Hello World"" program, I accidentally wrote \`Console.Writeline\` with a lowercase 'L' and spent an hour thinking I broke the compiler. Turns out, even genius engineers have their moments.



Finally, \`Console.ReadLine();\` is there to keep the console window open until you press Enter. Without it, the console would flash open and close faster than you can say ""Giraffe"". Trust me, after watching your masterpiece vanish instantly for the hundredth time, you learn to include \`ReadLine()\` like it's your mantra.



So, to summarize:



\- \*\*Namespaces\*\*: Organize your code and prevent naming conflicts. Also great for inserting a bit of personality into your projects. Just be cautious when your project manager asks why the authentication logic is under \`namespace Koala\`.



\- \*\*Classes and Methods\*\*: Define the structure and behavior of your program. The \`Main\` method is where it all begins. Kind of like the first sip of coffee that jumpstarts my day coding at warp speed.



\- \*\*Console Operations\*\*: \`WriteLine\` outputs text, and \`ReadLine\` waits for user input. They're the bread and butter of console applications. Speaking of bread, remind me to tell you about the time I tried to bake while debugging multi-threaded applications. Let's just say only one of them turned out well, and I still owe my neighbor a new oven.



In essence, this code is a simple yet foundational C# program that prints ""Hello World"" to the console and waits for you to press Enter before closing. It's the ""Hello Universe"" equivalent for developers‚Äîa small step in code, a giant leap in understanding.



I hope this entertaining tour through the code has been helpful! Remember, programming is as much about creativity and fun as it is about logic and precision. And sometimes, it's about naming your namespaces after giraffes just because you can.
