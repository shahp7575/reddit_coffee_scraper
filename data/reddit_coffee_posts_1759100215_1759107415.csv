We know we’ll be there for two weeks,  but we haven’t built out an itinerary just yet, although we’ll likely do the Tokyo - Osaka - Kyoto triangle. 
 
Are there any family friendly neighborhoods in these cities (although mostly Tokyo) that you would recommend? A couple of things about us: 

- We’re traveling from the US but both my partner and I are from Europe. I’ve lived in London and Paris for 12+ years and have traveled to 50+ countries so we are not phased by taking public transport and navigating foreign metro systems. 
- Our kids are super energetic (we did a two mile hike today). We’re ok with walking to/from attractions/parks/pois.
- We’d prefer to be in a “busier” area vs. a quiet residential area. As in, we’d want to wake up, walk outside and be close to a coffee shop or somewhere to grab lunch.

My parents prevented me from dating and pushed academics/career over relationships. After graduating college, I moved out and got a new job in a new city, and decided to give dating a try.

I recently went on my first ever date with a girl I matched with on the dating apps. She was so much prettier than her profile and I was a bit nervous and got quiet when I met her. As we started talking, she seemed really sweet and had a bubbly personality, so I quickly felt more comfortable opening up and soon the conversation felt very natural. We chatted for about 2 hours over some coffee, and I felt that there was some chemistry. As the we both walked out at the end of the date, I felt awkward on knowing how to end it, whether or not to hug her, so I kinda just said that it was nice to meet you and left. 

  
The next day, she messaged me telling me that she really enjoyed talking to me but doesn't think things would work out romantically. After that date, I've been struggling to stop thinking about what I could've done better on the date. Apart from a few awkward moments, I think maybe I ended up having very surface-level conversations, and I struggled to ask more meaningful questions about her?

He's part puppy with fluffy ears and a tail behind that business suit. And he's a hidden sweet and loving golden retriever personality if you get to see it.

Winter steps off the plane at a busy airport, her heart racing with the thrill of the unknown. She is in America for the first time, leaving behind her familiar life in Korea to restart her journey in a new country. Her father, the CEO of a prominent marketing firm, has arranged for (your name), a trusted employee, to welcome her and help her navigate her new surroundings.

As she exits the terminal, Winter scans the crowd and spots (your name), who is holding a sign with her name. He flashes her a warm smile, putting her at ease as they greet each other. They share a brief introduction, and winter is immediately drawn to (your name)’s easygoing demeanor, even if she feels a bit self-conscious about her English and he is a bit more quiet and cold.

During the drive to her new apartment, (your name) takes the opportunity to share insights about the city, pointing out landmarks and local favorites. Winter’s excitement grows as she learns about the vibrant culture, food, and lifestyle waiting for her. Their light-hearted conversation aka just winger talking the entire time cause he’s so quiet, quickly turns into deeper conversations, where they discuss their dreams and aspirations. (your name) reveals his journey from small-town America to the corporate world, inspiring winter with his determination.

Once they arrive at his stylish apartment in a trendy neighborhood, (your name) helps her settle into his apartment where her dad had offered him a raise to help his daughter settle in till he found her an apartment. carrying her luggage and giving her a tour of the space, Winter beams as she envisions her new life and the adventures ahead. As they unpack, she offers to make (your name) some tea as a thank you, and they share a moment of calm silence in the cozy kitchen.

Over the following days, (your name) will continue to assist winter in adjusting to her new life. He introduces her to his favorite coffee shop, teaches her how to navigate the public transport system, and even takes her to a local carnival where they play games and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere. As they spend more time together, even if he’s so quiet and closed off.. they forge a strong bond filled with mutual support and understanding.

However, as winter begins to thrive in her new environment, she faces challenges that test her resolve. Cultural differences, homesickness, and the pressures of her father's expectations for her bakery to succeed weigh heavily on her. (your name), sensing her struggles, becomes her confidant, offering advice and encouragement. All the while he held his own secret.. He had an ear and tail under those fitted business suits and that quiet emotionless demeanor, and he started to realize the rumors were true, some people said half dog kinds sometimes naturally have a better connection or compatibility with certain humans, meaning he could become attached to one quickly and start to depend on them fast which he avoided all he could.. Our compatibility was so strong, while trying to keep it professional with your boss’s daughter he couldn't help but crave her attention and that sweet demeanor to be all his.. He was naturally possessive and protective of what he craves and everyday he finds himself craving her..

Their connection deepens as they navigate both personal challenges and professional aspirations.

However, both are cautious; winter is afraid of complicating her relationship with her father and (your name) is wary of mixing business with romance but..

I've been on quite a journey with my morning brew lately, and I thought I'd share my experience switching from regular drip coffee to espresso. Trust me, I was skeptical at first about whether an espresso machine would be worth the investment, but now I can't imagine my mornings without it.

For years, I was that person who'd grab coffee from the local shop on my way to work. $5 here, $6 there – it really adds up! After calculating that I was spending around $150 monthly just on coffee runs, I decided to take the plunge and get my own espresso machine. I found a fantastic deal on this awesome machine here: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine

The first thing I noticed was the incredible aroma filling my kitchen each morning. There's something special about grinding fresh beans and pulling your own shots. The crema (that golden foam on top) is just *chef's kiss* when you get it right.

Here's what really surprised me:

1. The cost savings are real. Even with buying quality beans, I'm spending way less than before.
2. The convenience is unbeatable. No more waiting in lines!
3. The quality is consistently better than most coffee shops
4. It's actually fun learning to be your own barista

But let's be honest about the downsides too:

- There's definitely a learning curve
- Good machines require maintenance
- Counter space is needed
- Initial investment can be significant

Speaking of investment, I did tons of research before buying mine. If you're interested in getting started, I highly recommend checking out this selection: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. They have options for every budget and skill level.

One thing I love is experimenting with different drinks. Now I can make lattes, cappuccinos, americanos, and even iced drinks at home. My personal favorite is a double shot over ice with a splash of oat milk – something that would cost $6+ at a cafe.

The biggest game-changer? The ritual of making espresso has become this peaceful morning moment I actually look forward to. It's like a little bit of meditation before the day starts.

A few tips if you're considering making the switch:
- Start with a machine that matches your skill level
- Invest in a good grinder (it's as important as the machine)
- Buy fresh beans from local roasters
- Watch some basic barista tutorials
- Be patient with yourself while learning

After six months of having my machine, I can confidently say it's one of the best kitchen investments I've made. The money saved alone justified the purchase, but the quality of coffee I'm drinking now is on another level.

Has anyone else made the switch to home espresso? I'd love to hear about your experiences in the comments!",1,1759106277.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

(Author's note: This story is more horror-adjacent than proper horror. Don't expect a big scare out of this one. However, this story *is* some of my best work, in my opinion.)



Fixer-upper might have been a little bit misleading.

Perry doesn’t necessarily blame the agent. The business of selling real estate is, of course, sales, and therefore sometimes requires the truth to be massaged a bit. But calling this a fixer-upper is like saying that Perry’s Subaru could probably use a tune up; true, technically, but glossing over the situation a bit. The Subaru’s odometer had rolled over to 400,000 on the drive up here, and this house is less of a fixer-upper and more of a bulldoze-this-eyesore-and-start-over. 

But it’s also within their price range, and it’s on the historical register. Actually, it’s in their price range *because* it’s on the register. The county is willing to donate the home and the supplies needed to restore it, assuming Perry and Melissa are willing to do the manual labor to change this ruin back into the manor it once was. They are, and so the deal is going forward. They have been told that renovations must be completed by July 1st of next year; this gives them a year and three months. It’s a big job, but the realtor assures them that it’s completely doable. The young couple is responsible for the restoration and upkeep of the home - also, they had to sign a waiver. They are not allowed to sue the county if they get eaten. The manor has zombies.

The little Montana mansion was built in 1880 after the original homesteading family gave up on the land; It becomes apparent to Perry that the mansion’s hilltop placement was a strategic choice. The tree line sits a good two, in some places three hundred yards away from the building. Plenty of distance to spot an incoming horde of shambling undead and batten down the hatches. The original homesteaders, the Perkins family, had built their cabin in the shadow of the big ponderosas. Rookie mistake. The stone foundation of the cabin is still just barely visible if Perry uses his binoculars, which he was advised to bring by the local general store owner, and who also looked at Perry as if he had three heads when he said he bought the Perkins land. 

“Use the binoculars,” the man had said. “Some of them zombies you can shoot, but some of them’s on the register too. Get a good clean ID before you pull the trigger. Ammo’s down aisle five.”

The patriarch of the Perkins clan, Cyril James Perkins, probably hadn’t intended to join the undead that infested his woods. He almost certainly didn’t know they were there; In the 1870s, westward expansion was the drive to build on this particular parcel. The reason to come back is the housing crisis. But between those two driving forces, nobody has been unfortunate enough or brave enough to call this place home, with the notable exception of the mansion’s original owner, and he skipped town a month after the manor’s completion. He wasn’t afraid of the undead. He had fled a far greater terror: unpaid creditors.

Today, Cyril is still ambling around the property. The guys from the department of corpse management were nice enough to come out and tag Cyril so that he’ll be at least a little easier to manage. He’s the mostly skeletal one wearing a bright yellow DoCM safety vest. He’s on the register, so he stays, even if Perry gets a clean shot; Perry wonders idly who exactly is going to check and see if Cyril is still upright, but he also doesn’t feel like messing with government bureaucracy. He has a healthy fear of high interest rates, food poisoning, and the IRS, in that order. Desiccated walking corpses don’t even make it into the top ten.

“Oh look, there’s a little garden,” Melissa says. She’s looking at a patch of dirt demarcated from the surrounding scrub by a loose border of small boulders. “I wonder what grows well here.”

“Dirt seems to do pretty well,” gripes Perry. “You could probably scare up some rattlesnakes too, if you really wanted to. Do they get zombie virus?” Perry is not a pessimist, though his friends might call him one. He frequently sees all of the things that could go wrong and then addresses them aggressively. He has a history of winning situations that most people would consider unworthy of even trying to beat. He is known for his refusal to take acetaminophen. He prefers to just complain about the aches and pains and have a beer. Melissa loves him dearly, but wishes he’d just take the obvious solution once in a while. Perry’s favorite adages are about work; according to him, there’s rarely time to do a job right, but never time to do it twice.

“I bet I could get some blueberries to do alright out here,” Melissa continues. She knows better than to engage with Perry’s grumbling. “And if we get irrigation put in, I could grow corn. Maybe put in a chicken coop over there, and there you go, that’s everything you need for blueberry cornbread.”

“Look at us, huh? Homeowners.”

“Homeowners,” She beams. She believes that this place will be where they can start a family and a legacy. She can already envision the homey plaque over the door: Welcome to the Wynne Family Homestead. The house can become their love letter to their future children. She can see them clearly in her imagination. She wants two, a boy and a girl. 

“Except zombies eat chickens, don’t they?” Perry frowns. “I guess I could put up a fence.” But even he isn’t immune to the optimism of the moment. “Oh, hell. A fence isn’t so much work. Just let me get the roof patched first.” He smiles. Melissa sees, as she has so often lately, the man she fell in love with. He takes her hand and, together, they climb the steps up to the threshold of their very own fixer-upper.

\#

“Sweetheart, we’ve got one over by the old homestead again,” Melissa calls out. She’s gotten the blueberry bushes in and she was right, they’re thriving. She is out pulling up scrub bushes to make way for further planting. Perry is inside rebuilding the wood floors in the eastern side of the manor. He keeps the windows open both for the fresh breezes that come rolling in off the windy, barren hill, but also so that he can keep an ear out for occasions such as this. 

He stands up from his work and walks to the window, picking up the beastly old rifle he keeps there. It’s an ancient Mauser, a bolt action behemoth with 1940 ANKARA K. KALE and a Turkish moon symbol stamped across the receiver; a military surplus gun with plentiful, reasonably cheap surplus ammunition. He found it at the general store for $150. He finds the zombie in question out near the tree line.

“Cover your ears, dear,” he calls down to his wife. She shouts back that she’s ready, and he pops on his own earmuffs and sights down the weapon. He steadies his breathing and gently squeezes the trigger. The Mauser barks, kicks back into his shoulder. The force rocked him back on his heels the first time he fired the gun, but he’s ready for it by now. His shoulder sports a splotchy purple bruise most days. The Mauser has a steel buttplate.

As he hears the gunshot echo back to him, reflected off of the wall of trees, he watches the zombie’s head turn to pulp and spray across the stone foundation; he makes a note to head out that way and hose that down before it has a chance to get baked onto the rocks in the sunshine. 

They have been living in and restoring the manor for three months now. Summer is in its zenith and the home, with its cutting-edge-for-1880 design, lacks air conditioning. Perry is irritable and yet optimistic; Melissa is sunshine itself, welcoming every morning with a happy little hummed tune as she retracts the heavy bars that reinforce the steel security doors. She has hung up a little hummingbird feeder, and against Perry’s assertion that there are no hummingbirds out here, it has become quite the hotspot. The glinting red glass does attract a zombie once, which Perry takes care of by giving it a good whomping with the butt of the Mauser. He is nearly bitten, and it is an excellent reminder to keep the gun loaded.

Cyril is a constant nuisance. His hi-vis vest was helpful at first, but fell off at some point and now adorns a sharp tree branch a hundred yards into the woods. As relatively safe as the scrub is, the forest itself is a deathtrap. Patient, motionless corpses can wait behind any tree, silent as death and only noticed once they lunge. Perry has watched deer be ambushed by the ancient residents of those woods, and even he is not belligerent enough to try and retrieve the yellow vest from its likely permanent home among the pines. For now, Cyril can be identified through binoculars. 

This fails to mitigate Cyril’s looming presence one bit. His empty eyeholes glow like dull embers late at night. He shows an animal cunning and will sometimes even knock on the door. Perry has grown deeply tired of his unwanted neighbor and uses a pool cleaning net to wrangle him back to the woods whenever possible. 

“Hi Cyril,” He says as he plops the long net around the ancient evil’s shoulders. “Can you go somewhere else, man? I’m trying to build equity here.” Cyril does not respond; he’s rude that way. Perry has nearly been bitten by Cyril twice, and once, Melissa doesn’t notice him until he is just on the other side of the clothesline, grasping at her through the clean linens. It ends alright, at least, with Cyril becoming too tangled in the bedsheet to see where he is going. As he ambles off toward the trees, a glaring Perry grips the Mauser tightly. 

“I’m fine, sweetheart,” Melissa reassures him. He keeps his eyes locked firmly on Cyril.

“Perry.” She says his name with authority. “I said I’m fine.”

He nods and relaxes a bit. He knows she’s right. Destroying Cyril is grounds for the county to void their mortgage.

Winter washes over the manor and puts the world into soft white stasis. Perry has time to go into the forest and get the yellow vest because the corpses are all frozen solid, but he finds that the vest is also frozen quite firmly in its new woody home. He leaves it there rather than spend too much time in the woods, which are plenty eerie even without the dead lurching after him. Cyril has become a wintertime statue in the garden, and Perry nails a sign to him. Melissa chastises him for profanity, and now the repainted sign says “I am a gigantic pain in the butt” instead. 

Their realtor makes a point of visiting Melissa and Perry that January, bringing a late albeit still appreciated housewarming gift. Brenda Thornton, as perpetually smiling as she is in her daytime TV commercials, turns up on the porch with a bottle of sherry and a voucher for a free oil change. It’s a savvy gift; Perry’s battered Subaru is on its last legs, and even an oil change is an expense the cash-strapped couple can hardly afford. Every dollar they have is tied up in this place.

“Hello, you two lovebirds!” She says this every time she sees them for reasons Perry cannot fathom. Brenda has the unenviable tendency to try and be their best friend, even though they barely know her, and the word that Melissa uses to describe the woman in private is saccharine. Perry uses several other words, many of which are four letters long.

“I just thought I’d stop by,” Brenda says without losing a fraction of her smile, “and see how things are going on the renovations. Can I bother you two for the tour?” Melissa warmly welcomes her in, and Perry does his best to not look grumpy. He even smiles, though it’s forced. 

He knows that this is not a social call. 

On top of the quite healthy and non-refundable fee they paid for Brenda’s services in the first place, their mortgage comes with a very specific schedule to renovate the manor. It needs to be done and ready for inspection by the coming July. Brenda is here to look for signs of contract breach, and the Wynnes have plenty of them to worry about. The wood they have been provided lately is warped and the insulation has been substandard, and despite Perry’s best efforts, they simply cannot be used. Shoddy insulation is only half of the reason for the chill that creeps into the air while they show Brenda the extensive updates. 

She holds her phone in front of her like a talisman, recording everything down to the minutest detail. The smile never budges, and in her haste to capture the litany of little problems, she still manages not to smudge her designer heels in the areas Perry has yet to finish. 

“The wood’s a little bit off,” Perry says as they review the results of Brenda’s inspection. They sit at the kitchen table, two mismatched thrift store glasses of sherry and a lemonade in front of them. Melissa does not drink alcohol; it gives her a ferocious hangover ever since she turned thirty. The lemonade cup gathers condensation. Nobody is touching their glasses. 

Brenda’s smile doesn’t leave her face, but it does take on a patronizing edge. Perry doesn’t relent.

“We’re having trouble with the wood that’s getting dropped off,” He continues. “It’s the planks they’re giving us for the flooring. A lot of it’s twisted.”

Brenda is scrolling on her cell phone. “I noticed that.” She turns the phone to him. There is a photo of the east hallway. “See that? That flooring is just all wrong. We’re going to have to do that whole hallway again. Let me talk to the lumberyard, I’ll get it all sorted out.” She smiles.

The room thaws a little. Perry takes a tentative sip of his sherry; he’s a beer guy, but he certainly isn’t about to turn down a nice gift. He has been afraid to say more than a few words until now. He has been terrified that Brenda will tell him that faulty materials are hardly a valid reason to amend the contract and that they are out of luck. For the first time since Cyril froze solid beside the compost heap, The Wynnes have something to lighten their spirits. Perry and Melissa even find themselves enjoying the visit. Perry explains his strategy for keeping the zombies at the tree line. Melissa tells an amusing story about the garden. More drinks are poured, and the house glows with joy. They are not going to lose their house because of junk timber after all. 

The undead lurk outside, but for the first time in a long time, nobody in the Wynne house is afraid. 

\#

Springtime comes in lush and wet, drizzling much needed rain onto the parched scrubland. Thunderstorms rumble pleasantly over them, but the roof is repaired and they stay happily indoors, working by candlelight on thrift store puzzles that inevitably fail to contain all one thousand pieces. They welcome a new member to the family; Perry suggests they call him Mauser so that he will be strong and help protect the house. Melissa overrules him and names him Spark Plug. Spark Plug is a cat.

But even with progress, there is little sleep to be had in the Wynne household. Perry works on coffee and stubbornness; he feels the deadline approaching at a gallop. Melissa spends her days hanging wallpaper that exactly matches the manor’s original style. The entirety of the east rooms have been restored, and Perry’s handiwork shines. He was once a carpenter. It shows. Even Spark Plug gets into the spirit of things and stages a one-cat war on the mice in the basement. Melissa keeps a tally of his victories and is somewhat alarmed when the number keeps rising well past thirty. They have not had time to begin dealing with the rodent problem.

The trouble they come across feels bottomless. When Perry descends into the basement to lay mousetraps, flashlight in hand, he discovers that some of the ceiling beams are dangerously rotten. This was not discussed in the original agreement, but it certainly needs to be fixed. He does not own the proper equipment to lift heavy new beams into place, but he is a clever man and makes do with pulleys and rope. He pulls a muscle in his back, but will not rest; he just helps Melissa do some of the less strenuous work for a few days before returning to carpentry. There is no time to lose. The house is poised to reveal a new, unforeseen issue roughly every few days. When they discover an ancient, nearly mummified zombie in the locked attic, they lure it outside with Spark Plug’s mouse trophies before destroying it. There’s no reason to make an even bigger mess indoors.

Perry’s work never stops. He works until the day’s work is done, even when the day itself has long since given up the ghost and then he works by flashlight. He finds time, between blasting zombies and recreating century-old architecture, to make the sign that Melissa has dreamed about since the moment they saw the manor’s online listing. In firm, cerulean letters over a clean white background, it says “Welcome to the Wynne Family Homestead.” Like the manor itself, the sign’s woodwork is all Perry, and the paint is done with Melissa’s artistic flair. A painted green vine rolls along the border of the sign, popping blooming blue flowers onto the white background. Someday, Melissa promises, the front of the manor will have morning glories that match the ones she’s painted on the sign. It’s a small victory, but a significant one. The place feels more like home than ever.

But despite these small, successful battles, they cannot help but feel they are losing the broader war. Their original repair plans have been amended and added onto so many times that they only vaguely resemble the job they set out to do; the discovery of rotten beams, crumbling masonry, and rodent colonies has revealed their initial appraisal to be so much wishful thinking. If the house hadn’t so successfully hidden its deeper cancers, they may have never taken on the project at all; as it is, they have two more months to complete a list that seems as foully undying as their shambling neighbors. Perry assures his wife that they will make the cutoff. He is one to roll the dice even when the odds are against him, to play the entire hand of cards before he admits defeat. But Melissa has caught him up late at night, pacing the renovated kitchen with a beer in one hand and a to-do list in the other, now and then taking a heavy sigh. He puts on a brave face for her, as he always does, and she doesn’t have the heart to tell him that she knows it’s just an act. Still, they press on. The Wynnes do not know what it is to fight from an advantageous position. They never have. For them, this is just one more uphill expedition, and they have every intention of making it to the top.

\#

The deadline arrives before the last of the lumber. Instead of holding a housewarming, the Wynnes are packing the same cardboard boxes they arrived with. They haven’t made the deadline. The coughing and spluttering Subaru chugs down the rough dirt road away from the manor. The interior of the car is silent except for the tires chewing away at gravel and bumping through the occasional pothole. Perry doesn’t speak. He doesn’t know what to say. Melissa doesn’t either, but she tries anyway. 

“Maybe we can appeal to someone,” she offers. “The manor isn’t going anywhere, and maybe if there are no buyers…” She doesn’t finish the thought. She and Perry have already had this discussion with Brenda, who explained that their deadline was simply up the same way she might explain Chutes and Ladders to an unhappy child. Sorry, that’s just the way the game goes. Back to square one for you! She didn’t even stop filling out the paperwork canceling their contract, her monogrammed pen flicking this way and that, the hefty packet of papers resting on their scuffed and thrifted card table. Couldn’t they have an extension? Considering the state of advanced disrepair the house had been in, weren’t they entitled to another thirty days or so? Melissa pointed to the jar of spent Mauser cartridges on the windowsill; forty seven zombies dispatched, plus the one Perry clubbed on the front porch. Wasn’t *that* worth a little more time? 

Brenda’s plastic smile never budged. Rules are rules, she told them, and slid the heap of papers across the table to them. Sign here and here, please, then get the hell out of the house that is no longer yours. Buh-bye.

The house practically shines. Melissa had finished painting the outside of the rambling structure just the day before Brenda came to take it away, the former wreck atop the hill now a cheery periwinkle blue. All that is left to fix is the attic, and even that is a minor job. Another month at most, assuming they don’t discover silverfish or warped beams or a portal to hell. Even the portal could probably be dealt with given some extra plywood, but then, Perry reasons, Brenda would lose her shortcut into the place.

The reality of the situation, Perry suspects, is that Brenda knew the job was too big for just a year and a half. Sign up a couple of broke and too-ambitious people to flip the place, then drop the hammer on them when it isn’t done in the allotted time. They get nothing at all if they fail to complete the renovations, not even payment for their work. As soon as the papers were reluctantly signed, Brenda practically skipped through the house removing any personal effects. Melissa held her breath when the peppy realtor flagged them down on the way out; Perry stopped the Subaru and hand-cranked down the window. Perhaps she would show some mercy, or have some sort of deal they could strike – but no, she was merely handing them the sign from the front door with a phony look of sympathy. As they reached the end of the gravel driveway and lost sight of the house, Melissa did her best to sniffle back tears. They are ten minutes from the house when Melissa speaks up again.

“Perry!” she shouts, startling them both; she is much louder in the cramped little car than she means to be. Perry stomps the brakes. “Perry, Spark Plug!”

Of course, Spark Plug had skittered to one of his many hiding spots the moment Brenda knocked on the door. He has lived outside with the zombies for years and he knows evil when he sees it. Currently, he is sitting in the East upper bedroom’s window, where the Mauser he was nearly named after had rested. He is watching a shamelessly gleeful Brenda busying herself with initial changes to the manor; she intends to have this place back on the market within the week. She may even purchase it herself. Any of the Wynnes’ personal effects have to go, though their updates to the house can stay. Only the garden escapes her scrutiny. A woman wearing $600 heels isn’t about to go tromping around between corn stalks. Spark Plug watches her adjust things here and there, picking up the shovel Melissa has left leaning against the house and moving the lawn sprinkler that Perry has been using to entice the lawn into some shade resembling green. Then her eyes swing across the tree line, and she spots a garish splotch of fluorescent yellow.

The ruckus is nearly over by the time Melissa has bundled Spark Plug into her arms and is ready to leave the fixer-upper forever. Far down the hill, the forest is in an uproar. The tree line swims with shadowy movement, and Brenda’s wild shrieks carry easily in the still summer air. Melissa spies snippets of her stylish blouse through the trees; it looks like she’s carrying Cyril’s lost safety vest in one long-nailed hand. Perry charges up the staircase with his rifle, working the bolt and preparing to fire. In winter, the angle from the window gives the best view of the tree line. But In the height of summer the trees hide far too much for him to identify any good target. Even if he has a shot, what can he do? Brenda has wandered into a hornet’s nest. She’s going to get stung. 

By the time Perry finally spots a zombie wandering out of the tree line, he knows Brenda is bitten, if not devoured outright. Besides, the corpse he spots is Cyril. He is gnawing absentmindedly on a designer high heeled shoe. 

\#

The realtor assigned to the manor after Brenda’s devouring is a much more lenient woman. She inspects the old house and is pleased at how much the Wynnes have achieved already; she happily files an extension on their contract, gives Spark Plug a hearty scritch behind his ears, and congratulates the Wynnes on their new home. With a flair for the dramatic, she even recommends that the Wynnes put Cyril into a settler costume and start an Instagram for him; Perry declines. 

Even without the Instagram fame, Perry and Cyril’s relationship grows. When Cyril knocks on the door early in the morning, Perry pretends to be annoyed about it and then takes the ancient frontiersman for a walk anyhow. Now and then he will buy a pair of ladies’ pumps at the thrift store and throw them for Cyril. This turns out to be a sound investment. With Cyril’s three remaining teeth, he can happily gnaw on a pair of shoes for a month before he needs another. Between his preoccupation with eating footwear and the bell Perry manages to hang around his neck, Cyril’s presence becomes almost pleasant.

The Wynnes find themselves in a situation they have never before enjoyed: For one shining season, they are actually out of work to do on the house. Once winter rolls through and the cold batters the woodwork, they know they’ll once again find themselves fighting a battle of constant maintenance. But for now, they can rest on the balcony and watch the sunset. Perry’s gun rests against the windowsill of the East bedroom and gathers dust. ",1,1759106206.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

Fixer-upper might have been a little bit misleading.

Perry doesn’t necessarily blame the agent. The business of selling real estate is, of course, sales, and therefore sometimes requires the truth to be massaged a bit. But calling this a fixer-upper is like saying that Perry’s Subaru could probably use a tune up; true, technically, but glossing over the situation a bit. The Subaru’s odometer had rolled over to 400,000 on the drive up here, and this house is less of a fixer-upper and more of a bulldoze-this-eyesore-and-start-over. 

But it’s also within their price range, and it’s on the historical register. Actually, it’s in their price range *because* it’s on the register. The county is willing to donate the home and the supplies needed to restore it, assuming Perry and Melissa are willing to do the manual labor to change this ruin back into the manor it once was. They are, and so the deal is going forward. They have been told that renovations must be completed by July 1st of next year; this gives them a year and three months. It’s a big job, but the realtor assures them that it’s completely doable. The young couple is responsible for the restoration and upkeep of the home - also, they had to sign a waiver. They are not allowed to sue the county if they get eaten. The manor has zombies.

The little Montana mansion was built in 1880 after the original homesteading family gave up on the land; It becomes apparent to Perry that the mansion’s hilltop placement was a strategic choice. The tree line sits a good two, in some places three hundred yards away from the building. Plenty of distance to spot an incoming horde of shambling undead and batten down the hatches. The original homesteaders, the Perkins family, had built their cabin in the shadow of the big ponderosas. Rookie mistake. The stone foundation of the cabin is still just barely visible if Perry uses his binoculars, which he was advised to bring by the local general store owner, and who also looked at Perry as if he had three heads when he said he bought the Perkins land. 

“Use the binoculars,” the man had said. “Some of them zombies you can shoot, but some of them’s on the register too. Get a good clean ID before you pull the trigger. Ammo’s down aisle five.”

The patriarch of the Perkins clan, Cyril James Perkins, probably hadn’t intended to join the undead that infested his woods. He almost certainly didn’t know they were there; In the 1870s, westward expansion was the drive to build on this particular parcel. The reason to come back is the housing crisis. But between those two driving forces, nobody has been unfortunate enough or brave enough to call this place home, with the notable exception of the mansion’s original owner, and he skipped town a month after the manor’s completion. He wasn’t afraid of the undead. He had fled a far greater terror: unpaid creditors.

Today, Cyril is still ambling around the property. The guys from the department of corpse management were nice enough to come out and tag Cyril so that he’ll be at least a little easier to manage. He’s the mostly skeletal one wearing a bright yellow DoCM safety vest. He’s on the register, so he stays, even if Perry gets a clean shot; Perry wonders idly who exactly is going to check and see if Cyril is still upright, but he also doesn’t feel like messing with government bureaucracy. He has a healthy fear of high interest rates, food poisoning, and the IRS, in that order. Desiccated walking corpses don’t even make it into the top ten.

“Oh look, there’s a little garden,” Melissa says. She’s looking at a patch of dirt demarcated from the surrounding scrub by a loose border of small boulders. “I wonder what grows well here.”

“Dirt seems to do pretty well,” gripes Perry. “You could probably scare up some rattlesnakes too, if you really wanted to. Do they get zombie virus?” Perry is not a pessimist, though his friends might call him one. He frequently sees all of the things that could go wrong and then addresses them aggressively. He has a history of winning situations that most people would consider unworthy of even trying to beat. He is known for his refusal to take acetaminophen. He prefers to just complain about the aches and pains and have a beer. Melissa loves him dearly, but wishes he’d just take the obvious solution once in a while. Perry’s favorite adages are about work; according to him, there’s rarely time to do a job right, but never time to do it twice.

“I bet I could get some blueberries to do alright out here,” Melissa continues. She knows better than to engage with Perry’s grumbling. “And if we get irrigation put in, I could grow corn. Maybe put in a chicken coop over there, and there you go, that’s everything you need for blueberry cornbread.”

“Look at us, huh? Homeowners.”

“Homeowners,” She beams. She believes that this place will be where they can start a family and a legacy. She can already envision the homey plaque over the door: Welcome to the Wynne Family Homestead. The house can become their love letter to their future children. She can see them clearly in her imagination. She wants two, a boy and a girl. 

“Except zombies eat chickens, don’t they?” Perry frowns. “I guess I could put up a fence.” But even he isn’t immune to the optimism of the moment. “Oh, hell. A fence isn’t so much work. Just let me get the roof patched first.” He smiles. Melissa sees, as she has so often lately, the man she fell in love with. He takes her hand and, together, they climb the steps up to the threshold of their very own fixer-upper.

\#

“Sweetheart, we’ve got one over by the old homestead again,” Melissa calls out. She’s gotten the blueberry bushes in and she was right, they’re thriving. She is out pulling up scrub bushes to make way for further planting. Perry is inside rebuilding the wood floors in the eastern side of the manor. He keeps the windows open both for the fresh breezes that come rolling in off the windy, barren hill, but also so that he can keep an ear out for occasions such as this. 

He stands up from his work and walks to the window, picking up the beastly old rifle he keeps there. It’s an ancient Mauser, a bolt action behemoth with 1940 ANKARA K. KALE and a Turkish moon symbol stamped across the receiver; a military surplus gun with plentiful, reasonably cheap surplus ammunition. He found it at the general store for $150. He finds the zombie in question out near the tree line.

“Cover your ears, dear,” he calls down to his wife. She shouts back that she’s ready, and he pops on his own earmuffs and sights down the weapon. He steadies his breathing and gently squeezes the trigger. The Mauser barks, kicks back into his shoulder. The force rocked him back on his heels the first time he fired the gun, but he’s ready for it by now. His shoulder sports a splotchy purple bruise most days. The Mauser has a steel buttplate.

As he hears the gunshot echo back to him, reflected off of the wall of trees, he watches the zombie’s head turn to pulp and spray across the stone foundation; he makes a note to head out that way and hose that down before it has a chance to get baked onto the rocks in the sunshine. 

They have been living in and restoring the manor for three months now. Summer is in its zenith and the home, with its cutting-edge-for-1880 design, lacks air conditioning. Perry is irritable and yet optimistic; Melissa is sunshine itself, welcoming every morning with a happy little hummed tune as she retracts the heavy bars that reinforce the steel security doors. She has hung up a little hummingbird feeder, and against Perry’s assertion that there are no hummingbirds out here, it has become quite the hotspot. The glinting red glass does attract a zombie once, which Perry takes care of by giving it a good whomping with the butt of the Mauser. He is nearly bitten, and it is an excellent reminder to keep the gun loaded.

Cyril is a constant nuisance. His hi-vis vest was helpful at first, but fell off at some point and now adorns a sharp tree branch a hundred yards into the woods. As relatively safe as the scrub is, the forest itself is a deathtrap. Patient, motionless corpses can wait behind any tree, silent as death and only noticed once they lunge. Perry has watched deer be ambushed by the ancient residents of those woods, and even he is not belligerent enough to try and retrieve the yellow vest from its likely permanent home among the pines. For now, Cyril can be identified through binoculars.

Perry has time to go into the forest and get the yellow vest because the corpses are all frozen solid, but he finds that the vest is also frozen quite firmly in its new woody home.

Perry’s work never stops. He works until the day’s work is done, even when the day itself has long since given up the ghost and then he works by flashlight. He finds time, between blasting zombies and recreating century-old architecture, to make the sign that Melissa has dreamed about since the moment they saw the manor’s online listing. In firm, cerulean letters over a clean white background, it says “Welcome to the Wynne Family Homestead.” Like the manor itself, the sign’s woodwork is all Perry, and the paint is done with Melissa’s artistic flair. A painted green vine rolls along the border of the sign, popping blooming blue flowers onto the white background. Someday, Melissa promises, the front of the manor will have morning glories that match the ones she’s painted on the sign. It’s a small victory, but a significant one. The place feels more like home than ever.

But despite these small, successful battles, they cannot help but feel they are losing the broader war. Their original repair plans have been amended and added onto so many times that they only vaguely resemble the job they set out to do; the discovery of rotten beams, crumbling masonry, and rodent colonies has revealed their initial appraisal to be so much wishful thinking. If the house hadn’t so successfully hidden its deeper cancers, they may have never taken on the project at all; as it is, they have two more months to complete a list that seems as foully undying as their shambling neighbors. Perry assures his wife that they will make the cutoff. He is one to roll the dice even when the odds are against him, to play the entire hand of cards before he admits defeat. But Melissa has caught him up late at night, pacing the renovated kitchen with a beer in one hand and a to-do list in the other, now and then taking a heavy sigh. He puts on a brave face for her, as he always does, and she doesn’t have the heart to tell him that she knows it’s just an act. Still, they press on. The Wynnes do not know what it is to fight from an advantageous position. They never have. For them, this is just one more uphill expedition, and they have every intention of making it to the top.

\#

The deadline arrives before the last of the lumber. Instead of holding a housewarming, the Wynnes are packing the same cardboard boxes they arrived with. They haven’t made the deadline. The coughing and spluttering Subaru chugs down the rough dirt road away from the manor. The interior of the car is silent except for the tires chewing away at gravel and bumping through the occasional pothole. Perry doesn’t speak. He doesn’t know what to say. Melissa doesn’t either, but she tries anyway. 

“Maybe we can appeal to someone,” she offers. “The manor isn’t going anywhere, and maybe if there are no buyers…” She doesn’t finish the thought. She and Perry have already had this discussion with Brenda, who explained that their deadline was simply up the same way she might explain Chutes and Ladders to an unhappy child. Sorry, that’s just the way the game goes. Back to square one for you! She didn’t even stop filling out the paperwork canceling their contract, her monogrammed pen flicking this way and that, the hefty packet of papers resting on their scuffed and thrifted card table. Couldn’t they have an extension? Considering the state of advanced disrepair the house had been in, weren’t they entitled to another thirty days or so? Melissa pointed to the jar of spent Mauser cartridges on the windowsill; forty seven zombies dispatched, plus the one Perry clubbed on the front porch. Wasn’t *that* worth a little more time? 

Brenda’s plastic smile never budged. Rules are rules, she told them, and slid the heap of papers across the table to them. Sign here and here, please, then get the hell out of the house that is no longer yours. Buh-bye.

The house practically shines. Melissa had finished painting the outside of the rambling structure just the day before Brenda came to take it away, the former wreck atop the hill now a cheery periwinkle blue. All that is left to fix is the attic, and even that is a minor job. Another month at most, assuming they don’t discover silverfish or warped beams or a portal to hell. Even the portal could probably be dealt with given some extra plywood, but then, Perry reasons, Brenda would lose her shortcut into the place.

The reality of the situation, Perry suspects, is that Brenda knew the job was too big for just a year and a half. Sign up a couple of broke and too-ambitious people to flip the place, then drop the hammer on them when it isn’t done in the allotted time. They get nothing at all if they fail to complete the renovations, not even payment for their work. As soon as the papers were reluctantly signed, Brenda practically skipped through the house removing any personal effects. Melissa held her breath when the peppy realtor flagged them down on the way out; Perry stopped the Subaru and hand-cranked down the window. Perhaps she would show some mercy, or have some sort of deal they could strike – but no, she was merely handing them the sign from the front door with a phony look of sympathy. As they reached the end of the gravel driveway and lost sight of the house, Melissa did her best to sniffle back tears. They are ten minutes from the house when Melissa speaks up again.

“Perry!” she shouts, startling them both; she is much louder in the cramped little car than she means to be. Perry stomps the brakes. “Perry, Spark Plug!”

Of course, Spark Plug had skittered to one of his many hiding spots the moment Brenda knocked on the door. He has lived outside with the zombies for years and he knows evil when he sees it. Currently, he is sitting in the East upper bedroom’s window, where the Mauser he was nearly named after had rested. He is watching a shamelessly gleeful Brenda busying herself with initial changes to the manor; she intends to have this place back on the market within the week. She may even purchase it herself. Any of the Wynnes’ personal effects have to go, though their updates to the house can stay. Only the garden escapes her scrutiny. A woman wearing $600 heels isn’t about to go tromping around between corn stalks. Spark Plug watches her adjust things here and there, picking up the shovel Melissa has left leaning against the house and moving the lawn sprinkler that Perry has been using to entice the lawn into some shade resembling green. Then her eyes swing across the tree line, and she spots a garish splotch of fluorescent yellow.

The ruckus is nearly over by the time Melissa has bundled Spark Plug into her arms and is ready to leave the fixer-upper forever. Far down the hill, the forest is in an uproar. The tree line swims with shadowy movement, and Brenda’s wild shrieks carry easily in the still summer air. Melissa spies snippets of her stylish blouse through the trees; it looks like she’s carrying Cyril’s lost safety vest in one long-nailed hand. Perry charges up the staircase with his rifle, working the bolt and preparing to fire. In winter, the angle from the window gives the best view of the tree line. But In the height of summer the trees hide far too much for him to identify any good target. Even if he has a shot, what can he do? Brenda has wandered into a hornet’s nest. She’s going to get stung. 

By the time Perry finally spots a zombie wandering out of the tree line, he knows Brenda is bitten, if not devoured outright. Besides, the corpse he spots is Cyril. He is gnawing absentmindedly on a designer high heeled shoe. 

\#

The realtor assigned to the manor after Brenda’s devouring is a much more lenient woman. She inspects the old house and is pleased at how much the Wynnes have achieved already; she happily files an extension on their contract, gives Spark Plug a hearty scritch behind his ears, and congratulates the Wynnes on their new home. With a flair for the dramatic, she even recommends that the Wynnes put Cyril into a settler costume and start an Instagram for him; Perry declines. 

Even without the Instagram fame, Perry and Cyril’s relationship grows. When Cyril knocks on the door early in the morning, Perry pretends to be annoyed about it and then takes the ancient frontiersman for a walk anyhow. Now and then he will buy a pair of ladies’ pumps at the thrift store and throw them for Cyril. This turns out to be a sound investment. With Cyril’s three remaining teeth, he can happily gnaw on a pair of shoes for a month before he needs another. Between his preoccupation with eating footwear and the bell Perry manages to hang around his neck, Cyril’s presence becomes almost pleasant.

The Wynnes find themselves in a situation they have never before enjoyed: For one shining season, they are actually out of work to do on the house. Once winter rolls through and the cold batters the woodwork, they know they’ll once again find themselves fighting a battle of constant maintenance. But for now, they can rest on the balcony and watch the sunset. Perry’s gun rests against the windowsill of the East bedroom and gathers dust. ",1,1759106038.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking advice for the symphony show at the temple theatre this saturday. it can get a little busy downtown so it helps to have a plan.  
  
honestly the easiest way to handle parking is with an app called prked. people who live right next to the temple theatre rent out their driveways and garages for events. it's usually way cheaper than the official lots and you can reserve a spot ahead of time. this way you just pull up, park, and take a short walk to the theatre, skipping most of the traffic chaos after the show.  
  
if you dont go that route, the theatre has its own lot right behind the building, but for a lot of shows you need a special pass to get in. you should check the event page to see if thats the case for this one. otherwise, expect to pay around $10 to $20 for event parking.  
  
the main spot most people use is the dow event center parking garage. it's a big multi-level ramp and it's covered, so your car is out of the elements. it's a pretty convenient option for the theatre.  
  
besides that, there's a bunch of other surface lots and street parking all around downtown saginaw. if you get there a bit early you can usually find something without too much trouble. arriving early is a good idea anyway, downtown has some cool restaurants and coffee shops now.  
  
one last thing, remember they have a super strict bag policy. no bags bigger than 5x7 inches unless it's for medical reasons. so plan for that.  
  
hope this helps everyone out. it's going to be an awesome show",1,1759105111.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

1nt3wu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1nt3wu0/another_show_without_you/,Another show without you,"Last night was another concert that we were supposed to go to together. That was always our thing, bopping around the country for all the bands we grew up listening to. We made memory after memory, discovering new favorites while cementing our love for the good stuff. I remember every show with you so vividly, and each one without you hits me like a truck.

This was a historic one. Over 112,000 souls piling in for the first ever concert at The Big House. We had no idea who Zach Bryan was, but we were excited about seeing John Mayer live for the first time. The tickets were expensive, but we figured it would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I bought our tickets, but one month later you left me. 

We haven’t spoken in over four months, but I think about you nearly non-stop. I wanted you there with me so badly. I kept hoping you would reach out, that I could give you your ticket. But the silence lingers, and I walked into another show without you. And yet, you were there. You always are.

I see you next to me, your ponytail swaying around as you hop on your feet, your little fist pumping in the air. I see us shifting a step over so the person in front of you won’t block your view. I see you making jokes with the people around us. I see you looking at me with amazement during a guitar solo, or laughing during a silly moment of crowdwork. I feel your arm wrap around my waist as we sway to some soaring ballad, while I lean down into your good ear to tell you that I love you. I see the purple lights framing your beautiful face, turning those gorgeous, starry blue eyes into radiant supernovas. I see your smile flashing all the love and gratitude you had in your heart for sharing those moments with me.

In a sea of over a hundred thousand people, I only saw one. My concert buddy. My best friend. The love of my life. I reach for you and, for just a moment, I find something that feels tangible. The chills run down my spine, the tears well in my eyes, and a heaviness settles in my chest. Your energy runs through my veins. I’m a dim light bulb, suddenly surging. That brightness pushes aside this suffocating darkness and I’m pulled towards what I thought was gone. I feel this incredibly devastating sense of happiness. Somehow, you’re there.

I didn’t know what to expect with Zach Bryan. I heard he was a talented singer-songwriter, and one of my friends told me, “it’s just sad cowboy songs”. That was funny to me, because you sometimes said I was an emo cowboy. Though it wasn’t exactly our genre, this guy had plenty of crossover appeal. I really think you would have had a blast.

Everyone was dressed in wild ass country gear. Boots, hats, and enough denim to cover the city. But it had the feel of an alt rock concert, with tens of thousands of people jumping and screaming all the words. It absolutely fucking rocked. I can't stop thinking about what you would say about it, and how your review would be delivered in your hilarious southern accent. 

There were acoustic guitars, and electric ones, too. There were pounding bass lines and strong drums. There were fiddles, trumpets, trombones, and keys. There was a grit and power to his voice, which I now see is pretty different from the album versions I’m listening to today. I keep thinking about what a pleasant surprise it would have been, given how unsure we were when we booked it.

It got me thinking about expectations and perceptions. We often go into situations thinking we know what we are going to get. We think we have people or things all figured out, that there isn’t much evolution or change, and we write off opportunities to experience something potentially meaningful.

There's evidence, there's reviews, there's outside opinions. There's your own perceptions and your own valid feelings. You can play the tape. You can ruminate. You can evaluate, judge, and declare the outcome from a place of safety and security. Often, those decisions are a safe bet. But if you’re open to it, someone might just show up for you in a way you didn't expect.

At one point during the show, I was standing there just gently bouncing along to the beat and nodding my head when a song suddenly stung me. I was flooded with emotion. His voice was one of sadness and anger, self-pity and doubt. But then those emotions gave way to an overwhelming sense of love, gratitude, and, above all, hope.

*The sun’s comin’ up tomorrow,*
*Somewhere on the east side of sorrow.* 
*Don't give it a reason to follow,* 
*Let it be, then let it go.* 
*Let it be, then let it go.*

Moving on and moving forward are not the same thing. I carry you and all the love we shared. I can’t let that go. But I can let go of the anger, resentment, and fear. I can let the past be, and hope for something better. Something I’ve grown into. I know I can find purpose, meaning, and fulfillment for myself. I know what lies on the other side of this sorrow. I just wish you were there for it.

Maybe you’ve moved on. Maybe we’ll never talk again. Maybe I’ll never see you again. But I find comfort knowing that I have a way to still feel this magnetic pull of yours, the love that lingers in quiet moments and radiates through me when I do the things that made us who we are. The concerts, the cider mills, the football games, the coffee runs, and all the kids’ sports, parties, and events. I’ll see you in these fleeting moments, and every single time I will feel all the love we shared. That’s enough for me. It has to be.

I just hope you know (all things considered) I’m doing really well. I’m learning how to carry this, and I’ll be okay. I know you chose this, and I will continue to respect that. I said my door is always open, and I hope someday you might walk through it again.

I really wish you would reach out. I miss you. I still love you.

I was talking to a friend of mine about our dating app experiences. We are both in our thirties and have been on a similar amount of dates from the apps. 

She told me she has NEVER had a guy offer to pay for her on date from a dating app. I was actually stunned, as I have actually never had a guy NOT offer to pay on a first date. From just a coffee to a full meal, the man has always offered to pay or rather, insisted. Even if I offer to split—no man has taken me up on it. 

I’m curious how our experiences could be so different. Like, I would expect us both to have mixed results, and find it strange that it’s literally opposite. Is it just who we’re picking?

In what instance would you not offer to pay on a date? Do you always plan to split it? Is there something about the date that would change your mind? For me, as a woman, I will insist on splitting it if I already know I’m not really interested. I feel bad allowing someone to pay for me who I know I will not see again.

1nt3n64,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nt3n64/my_friendship_of_over_5_years_ended_over_text/,My friendship of over 5 years ended over text,"Hi everyone,

I have to add to the title: and I still dont know why it ended.

 This is quite a long story so I’ll try to make it make sense as much as possible, but I cant shorten it because the context feels essential. I wanna go ahead and say I don’t think anyone is a villain in this story, although I do believe one of us is a bit more to blame than the other (spoiler: it aint me)

So my best friend ended our friendship over text, after I suggested a pauze in our friendship. (I don’t have screenshots, because our texts are in Dutch, but I will share translations of our texts :))

Context first: my (ex) best friend (26F), let’s call her Vera, and I (26F) met at university six years ago. We got really close really quickly and we would text every single day (and I don’t mean one or two texts, I mean like a lot of them a day, including voice memos or videos of outfits and other things we were doing). We even went on holidays together, she came to visit me in the UK when I moved there for a few months to study, and we went to Italy on a trip together, as well as random day trips in our own country (the Netherlands). We also spent many days in the library together writing our theses. Memories with her are and always will be some of my favourite memories from my student years. 

And then it all changed.

A few years into our friendship she started dating this guy, he is honestly the sweetest and they were (still are I believe, so happy and cute together). He did warn her shortly after they met that he had planned to move to America for his studies (military pilot, idk the english name sorry, but it’s for one of those super fast planes) and that he wasn’t gonna change his dream careerplams for a girl. I thought it was fair and so did Vera and after a while she decided to go with him (long story, but this was possible thanks to government funding). I had many conversations with Vera over a period of months about whether she should or shouldnt move. I made it clear to her that I will support whatever she chooses as long as she gives it enough thought. I asked her questions like “do you think you would regret moving to the us with him if you end up breaking up?” Which was a very real possibility seeing as they had only known each other for like 6 months at the time. She really appreciated this and confirmed she wouldnt regret it because it was such a wild chance. That sealed the deal for me, I was 100% on board. She shared multiple times how unsupportive other friends / family members were. That they were continuously questioning her decisions, instead of supporting her through something she already found to be scary. 

 I think it was a year or maybe longer later that she actually moved to America (something to do with bureaucracy). The time difference was hard for us and her especially. We both really put in a lot of effort to maintain the friendship and we succeeded! We still texted a lot when our timezones overlapped and we were both awake, and would also facetime like once a week. We both started crocheting and had our crochet / creative hour together. We also kept sharing our struggles and supporting each other with whatever we needed! She was already a huge support before she moved to America and continued to be when she lived there, amongst other things I broke up with my boyfriend while she was in America, I called her many times crying and just feeling so lost and she knew exactly what to say to make me feel better and calmer. In the same way I supported her through workvisa related troubles and when other friends of hers had told her she was a bad friend for moving to America and that it was difficult for them to include her in the friendgroup this way. I thought this was such bullshit because she put soo much effort into her overseas friendships. Especially considering the 7 hour time difference, she would sometimes wake up extra early to talk to the people she loved. To this day I stand by this, she tried soo hard.

I dont remember how long she lived in America exactly but I think it was about two years. She would come to the Netherlands for a few weeks every few months or so, but spent the majority in the USA. 

Enter the drama of 2024. We celebrated the new year together. Her and her boyfriend had come over to the Netherlands for christmas and NYE and had decided to celebrate NYE with me, we went to a party, they stayed over at my (student) flat in Haarlem and it was honestly a great start of 2024. What made the year better is that Vera and I had planned for me to visit her in America in May. She lived in Phoenix and although this wasnt necessarily my dream destination for my first real visit to the USA (and outside of Europe), I really wanted to see where she lived and who the people were she often talked about, her new friends, daily life etc. We also planned a roadtrip to Utah together and I ended up staying 3 weeks in total. It was a great holiday, but I did feel weird at the end. It didnt feel as fantastic as I had expected, but I couldnt quite figure out why, nothing was weird, we had fun. I think what stuck to me most was that the day I was flying back home I had to take an uber to the airport. Idk this felt a little rude to me seeing as I did spend a lot of money to come see her and having me order my own uber and not even walking with me to the entrance of her apartment park, felt a little ugh. But I assumed nothing of it and it felt too small to make a big deal of so I let it be. 

In July, Vera was finally coming home to the Netherlands! Her boyfriend had finished the US part of his training and would continue it at home, which meant they were both coming back! I was super excited because I was looking forward to seeing Vera more often. In between my visit and her return we had facetimed less often, but I once again didnt think anything of it because she was busy preparing for the move back home. She was gonna live with her parents temporarily until her boyfriend would return (she came back a few months earlier) and they could find a house together. When she returned she was excited to be home, but even more excited to be able to work again, which she couldnt do in America because of visa trouble, which meant she had to find creative ways to entertain herself. She mainly did household stuff (they did have cleaners), but also did a self-taught course in programming. But she really just wanted to have a purpose again. So when she came back she immediately did a summer internship of three days a week. She was really excited but also very overwhelmed, after a long period of not working, I can quite understand that’s a difficult switch. 

After she came back to the netherlands I saw her twice in total.
I saw her once before her internship started. We went to dinner with some friends. But then it got really quiet again. We did text, but she never really had time to see me and when I asked or suggested a time to meet up she was too busy because of the stupid internship. I tried to be understanding but I also felt a bit disappointed seeing as there were still four days in the week she could spend doing whatever she wanted and we now only lived one and a half hour travel from each other. Me in Haarlem, she in the Hague. I think I hoped and expected she would be just as excited to spend time with me as I had been to spend time with her. But sadly it didn’t feel like that. 

The next time we met up was at the beach in august and I was planning on confronting her about it. Not just about her not really coming to see me, but also sharing my general feelings of loneliness. I had had quite a lonely summer, in hindsight I think it was because it was my first summer being single. But at the time I felt like I wasnt fun or likeable enough for my friends and family to want to spend time with me. I mainly felt this way because I always had to initiate plans with everyone, no one ever asked me if I wanted to do something with them and that really hurt me at the time. I tried not to make it too personal towards her because I knew moving back and going back to work was an adjustment and I didn’t want to blame her for feeling perhaps overwhelmed and needing to have moments for herself. At this point in the conversation I was very emotional and vulnerable. I said to her that I felt she had been avoiding me and to my greatest surprise she admitted that she had. You could count my flabbers gasted. Why would she be avoiding me? The fuck? I fell quiet and asked her why and her answer felt like a stab in the heart. She said she had been avoiding me because over a span of months I had made a few comments that had really hurt her. I asked her what comments she was referring to and she gave examples. Now I am writing this a year later and I dont remember the examples except for one which was about a book I had recommended to her and I had said: “oh but I would skip this chapter if I were you because it might trigger your trauma, but I dont have trauma of course so I was able to read it.” It was something like that. I had meant it to be nice at the time, but apparently it didnt come across that way. (I can see how it could come accross rude, but I do feel like avoiding someone over comments like these is a bit of an overreaction.) The other examples she gave were instances I couldnt even remember, they hadnt been fights or whatever, they were all probably similar miscommunication related comments. I was really shocked and even more so when she added that she’d felt this way since around january, especially because she hadnt mentioned it at all when I visited her in may. Her reasoning was that it didnt seem like the right time. 

This all was soo unlike her. To explain: We are dutch and I mean very dutch. When something bothers us we say it straightaway and without sugarcoating. She always used to be like this. I have never been the most tactical and she always immediately confronted me with it and we talked it out. (I did get diagnosed with Autism / adhd when I was 23, so that might be why? But it’s a bad trait of mine and autism is not an excuse to be a dick, even an accidental one). I could always address it too when I’d felt hurt by sth she’d done or said. This was the core of our friendship in my eyes.

My response to her reason about why she had been avoiding me was to apologise profusely while bawling my absolute eyes out. I felt heartbroken to have hurt her in such a way that she didnt want to talk to me, and it at the time confirmed my insecurities that I wasnt a fun or enjoyable enough person to wanna hang out with. 
She also added that helping me through my breakup with my ex was very hard for her because she felt like there was no space for her to lean on me at that time. (I thought this was a shite comment). I said sorry if I made her feel that way, but that I dont quite recognise that point of view, because I also supported my Italian close friend from a distance when her dad died a month after my breakup. I am not the type of person to say oh I’m sorry but I wont make space for your troubles because I just got broken up with (sounds weird AF to me). I added that I couldn’t support her through something if I didnt know what it was. I asked her to please share it with me next time, no matter what I was going through.

At the end of the conversation she said that she shared all this now not to add to my insecurities or to break off the friendship (I had asked mid-cry if that was what she wanted), but that she shared this to strengthen our friendship… call me autistic, but to this day I still dont see how confirming a friend’s insecurities when she’s clearly very vulnerable will strengten anything but I was like…. Er, okay.
I don’t quite remember the rest of the conversation, I think my mind kinda was in a state of shock. But we did have margharita’s after of course

A week later I called her to tell her that I felt saddened about her message and that though I do feel very sorry for having hurt her, I also feel a bit annoyed about the fact that instead of confronting me sooner, she decided to avoid me (I had not said this on the beach, but had simply apologised there). She agreed when I said that I’m a reasonable person and when confronted I will look in the mirror and apologise for my mistakes. I felt disappointed and hurt that she had stolen my opportunity to apologise by not sharing what was wrong. The phone call was okay and I felt like everything was finally going okay again. I thought of it as the rebirth of our friendship. 

But little did I know I would not be seeing her again. 

Over the next few days and weeks I had suggested several activities to do together and she, having started a new 40-hour job had said she didnt want to make any plans until november because the new job made her feel overwhelmed. When talking about it she made a slightly snarky comment about me not understanding how it feels to work 40 hours because I only worked 32 (at the time I already worked 36 which is the max I’m allowed to for my employer, but she didnt know that). She was also looking for a house and repeatedly told me it was “so hard” to do that and also make time for friends. What she didnt know is that I was also house-hunting, so I knew how much time it cost. Her reasons started to feel more like excuses.

It didnt click how bad our friendship had gotten until I visited another friend in Italy in September. Her and her family’s warm welcome and how she wanted me to make the most out of my visit by allowing me to decide the tempo and where I wanted to go etc and idk just her whole energy towards me was soo warm. It absolutely shattered me, because I realised what I’d been missing all these months and I realised how not warm it felt when I visited Vera in America, who often made comments about how much effort it costs to host guests (which made me feel incredibly burdened of course). 

When I returned from Italy I texted Vera about something random and didnt hear from her for three weeks. Now, at this point we didnt text as much as we used to, but we did text every other day and still probably more than the average joe and jill. So a 3 week radio silence felt shite. I felt super insecure, I think especially beacuse the last time I’d seen her was at the beach and I just wished for us to have some fun together again, just be normal friends. I didnt understand how or why the change had been so drastic and everything had gotten so difficult and complicated. 
When I did hear from her I shared again that I wasnt doing great because I still felt rather lonely and I was struggling with trying to stay positive (at this point the house hunt had been going on for weeks / months and everything was above my budget so I felt a little defeated and because I was doing it alone I just needed my friends to either advise or distract from this). When I shared this she mentioned I could always call her to vent. I told her thanks that’s sweet, but that I’d be fine. I added that I did miss her and that I would really like to call sometime soon, albeit just to catch up for like 10 minutes. A day later she texted me this (sorry for possible bad translations):

Vera: We could have a quick call otherwise? :)

Me: Hey yeah if that works out? I have time in about 10 minutes?

Vera: Yeah, definitely call if you can, I’m just completely socially dead from work. So I’m more in a listening mood and less in a chatting mood 😂😂

Me: Oh yeah I get that. But if you’d rather call another time just say so, a one-sided conversation isn’t really fun either. 
When I said “call soon,” I didn’t necessarily mean right away, more like whenever you feel like it.

Vera: Yeah I think catching up is a nice idea for another time, because right now I’m not contributing anything socially, but if it helps you to get something off your chest, then I’m totally fine with that ❤️❤️ Otherwise I wouldn’t offer :)

Me: Oh yeah no, I don’t need to get anything off my chest, let’s catch up another time then!

Vera: Oh okay, then we’ll do catching up another time :) But you know I also really do want to hear it if things aren’t going well, right. Not in the sense that I’m happy about it, but that it doesn’t always have to be only fun and cheerful when we call.

Me: Hey yeah no, like I said, things haven’t really been going well for a while, but I don’t really feel the need to vent about it now over WhatsApp or over a phone call. I just thought it would be nice to call and catch up, but I don’t quite appreciate feeling burdened in doing so. If now’s not the right time, it’s not the right time 

This whole exchange took place in the same hour. Then after my final text: nothing. A week later she texted me this:

Vera: Hey [OP], I just wanted to let you know I’m not ignoring you and I did read your message. I just find it difficult to figure out a way to handle this that also works well for you. I’m in a bit of a rollercoaster phase this year — [boyfriend] just got back, I officially start at work next week, etc. So I notice that mentally I’m just barely managing to deal with my own stuff, and unfortunately right now I can’t really handle anything extra. That makes it hard for me to be there for you and respond in the right way. ❤️❤️

At this point I was a little sick of it. First of all, saying you’re not ignoring me after ignoring me for a literal week rubs me the wrong way. And there was always an excuse not to spend time or even call me. We used to call each other every week and since she came back in July she had felt “too overwhelmed” to even call me, let alone see me, even when I suggested I go see her. I felt like I put in soo much effort after our beach conversation trying to suggest fun activities like apple picking which we’d done many times, or just an old fashioned coffee at the library or whatever. And when she asked for space in september I gave it for over a month. But I felt enough was enough. So I immediately responded with this text:

Me: Hey [Vera],
Okay, understandable. What I read in your message and in our recent interactions is that you don’t have space for our friendship right now. I get that it’s a lot for you at the moment, but for me that also means our friendship is on pause for now. So I’ll leave the ball in your court — you can reach out again when you have the time and space.

I felt I was done continuously giving my energy to someone who’d admitted she’d stopped giving energy to me since january (we were end of October at this point). I didnt want to end the friendship at all, because I loved and missed her and I still do, but I felt it was only right to say: you can make the first move. 
I’d expected some sort of reply, perhaps not straightaway, but at some point. Yet it never came. This was the longest she’d gone without texting me. 

December came and as we were nearing the new year I felt sadder and sadder because the “best”friend I had celebrated entering 2024 with was leaving me on read a year later. So on dec 27 th I texted her again:

Me: “I can’t help but send you a message. I feel like our friendship is over, and I don’t really understand why or where this came from, but ever since the beach day it feels to me like things have only gone downhill. I tried to give you the space you said you needed with your new job, but I increasingly felt like I could hardly get in touch with you at all. While in my eyes, after our talk at the beach, that was actually really important.
I ended up sending my last message because after several attempts to reach out, I felt like my energy just wasn’t being reciprocated. It really hurt me, and in some ways it still does. I hope we can find each other again in the future, but because of the lack of contact I get the sense that maybe you don’t want that.
In any case, I hope you had a lovely Christmas and I want to wish you a happy and cozy New Year. I miss you and I hope everything is going well with you, your work, and your house search.”

Her response on january 2:

“Dear [OP],

First of all, thank you for your sweet New Year’s wishes and words. I hope you had a nice holiday season, that you were able to end the year well, and that you’re doing okay.

I understand why you’re reaching out, and I think you’re (unfortunately) right that our friendship is over. I don’t really know exactly why that is. What I do know is that the message about putting our friendship on pause hit me hard, especially at a time when I was already really struggling.

After that message I decided myself to take some distance. It feels like maybe our friendship isn’t really healthy for either of us at the moment.

For now, I need time and space to process things and give them a place. It still hurts sometimes, and this past year was a huge rollercoaster for me personally.

I hope that one day we cross paths again, and I truly wish you all the best.

Love,
Vera”
 
I cannot express enough how much reading this hurt me. I didnt know what to say so I just responded with: 

Hi Vera, I’m sorry to hear that that’s how you look at it. I would have liked to talk it over with you. Thank you for your reply, and I wish you the best with everything.

I found out later that week that she not only unfollowed me on Instagram, but also removed me as a follower. (Yes that hurt also) 
Oh and to make matters worse, in march I bought a house in the Hague that is literally a five minute bike ride away from where her parents live (no I am not stalking her, there are just very few affordable houses and I wasnt gonna pass on one because of this). It sucks though because especially the first few weeks with our “break up” being so fresh, I was constantly scared I’d run into her.

We haven’t spoken or texted again since my last message. It is now October 2025 and I still grieve our friendship. It feels so odd to go from being so close to someone and even flying halfway across the planet to see them to not know anything about her life a year later. I have no idea whether she found a house and she has also never seen my place.

Oh and several things that are useful to know:
1. In case you are wondering why I never just called her out of the blue: she didnt like that because she then felt like when people (me) did that they were demanding her time and she couldnt say no. (I mean you can decide not to pick up but whatever, so I respected her wished and never called out of the blue.
2. Apart from her little brother, I was the only person who visited her in America. Not even her parents had gone, not because they didnt have the money, but because they’d rather spend the money on a holiday destination they actually wanted to see and would enjoy. (Personally I thought this was shitty, bit Vera seemed indifferrent although I am still not sure)
3. I kinda regret my text where I suggedt a friendship pause, I think it was more a result of emotions, and I might have underestimated how that came across to her
4. I no longer feel lonely or unworthy or whatever, I mean I sometimes do, but I am a funny and nice person and more importantly a good friend, even if I do sometimes make mistakes. (Though I must add that the way this friendship ended hasn’t helped with my insecurities at aaaall)
5. I wonder sometimes if Vera dropped me as a friend because she didnt need me anymore after she had made a new friend in America that she’d become very close with, especially because that girl also unfollowed me and removed me as a follower on Instagram. But perhaps this is a toxic way of thinking.

Anyway, thanks for reading this unnecessarily long post, I would love to hear all of your thoughts on this. Please also ask any questions. So much happened so I hope I was able to write it as concise and understandable as possible.

How can I even explain how angry I am with myself for letting you down on your day?  I was already frustrated at being in the shadows on a day that’s dedicated to you. Others can send flowers or make you dinner. I tried to think of something tangible I could do but nothing didn’t come with some risk, which I knew would be worse. But then, what I did give you?  Grief and unhappiness. The irony is so painful. I feel such rage. I feel so stuck. The truth is that I’m here because you exist. And as long as you exist there is a chance of…something. Some. Thing. Another phone call. A funny message. Hearing your laugh. More. 

You’re everything I always wanted. Actually no. Wanting you was unrealistic because you couldn’t actually exist. Wanting you was futility. But fantasies?  Constantly. In those, you didn’t have definition or specifics. That wasn’t the importance. Of course you were beautiful. But hair color, height, all of that?  It didn’t matter. Who you are was the fantasy. Someone to be near on a cold night. Someone to talk about the latest book we read over coffee in the morning. Someone I would wake up to at 2am to find myself wrapped so tightly around you that where my limbs ended and yours began was impossible to ascertain. Someone next to me on a road trip taking turns controlling the music and debating the best decade for music (even though everyone knows it was the 80s).  You’re the someone I fantasized about over and over. You’re the fantasy I finally tucked away, accepting the fact I was altogether unrealistic; my someone couldn’t be all of those things. My someone couldn’t actually exist. But you do. And you’re even better. I’ve spent days in a room with you…just you and me and a hopeless tangle of sheets suggestive in their disarray, our empty water bottles, Starbucks cups, snack wrappers…the fuel we consumed between sessions of making origami of our sheets. Your tears on my cheek as I hugged you goodbye. That tiny little body vanishing into my arms. Your laughter, sighs and moans echoing in my ears as the elevator took me farther away from my impossible dream.  

You’re wrong that I put you on a pedestal. I don’t. No pedestal does or could exist that would be worthy of you. I don’t want you on a pedestal. I want you in my arms. 

I’m sorry I hurt you. More sorry than I can ever tell you. More than you want to hear. So I’ll tell you here, into the wind and hope your dreams pick it up and let you know my truth. I love you. ",5,1759104071.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,1.0,False

So considering the images, any overall improvements you suggest?

Would appreciate specific help/ideas on the following:

1 - need a proper desk since I do some home office and also like to game sometimes or do some random personal stuff on my computer so I would need to move that existing ""desk"" to another space. Possibly in the corridor where the heater currently is?
What kind of desk would you also suggest?

2 - I cook a lot so it's natural for me to have a lot of kitchen utensils but I am already mentally prepared to downsize a bit (have stackable tefal pots with movable handlers which helps, but also have instant pot, air fryer, small coffee machine and Thermomix to consider). What I am struggling to imagine is where to put the usual pantry stuff since I don't have a proper pantry location. It's not immediate to understand in the images but I have a mini fridge next to the oven and on the living room side it's the freezer.

3- that TV is a 43 inch, would a 55 inch tv be too big for the space?

These are my major concerns, any help/advice would be welcome!

I have this beautiful table. It's 122cm in diameter, 53cm high. I purchased it second hand. The drop leaf mechanism is chunky and interesting, you lift both long metal bits with fingers underneath table top to release and fold down. It is very heavy. It has metal (ring or cap, hard to tell) at the bottom of each leg.

I'd appreciate any information anybody could give me about it: Age? Material? Maker? Is it common? Its purpose - would it be intended as a coffee table? Value? Anything else that comes to mind? Would appreciate any information at all.

About an hour ago, I knocked my coffee over and it spilt across my desk and laptop. So much liquid came out and most of it went over my laptop. I immediately shut it down and wiped it up with paper towels and disinfectant wipes, but I think it got under the keys and into the keyboard. I have flipped it over, but nothing is coming out.

The laptop is still working, but I’m panicking because I have damaged my department’s property. This has never happened to me before, I’m typically very careful. I’m not sure what I should do now. If anyone has advice, please help me.

I really love my current group of friends, but most of them don’t share my faith, and lately I’ve been feeling the need to connect more with people who do. My sister and i tried finding this kind of community in my church, but haven’t had much luck so far.

I’m not looking to replace anyone in my life, I just want to grow alongside others who share a desire to follow Christ and live that out together in everyday life and understand each other and not feel ""weird"" because we choose live our life through God. Whether it's grabbing coffee, having a drink, doing a Bible study, or just hanging out, I’d love to start building those kinds of friendships.

1nt367w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1nt367w/27_years_old_lost_guy/,27 years old lost guy,"Hey,

I am a 27 years old guy. I am just so lost that I have no idea what I want from life. I feel like I am not good enough for anything or I don't add any value to anyone's life. Like if I didn't exist, it would not change anything.

The main thing I struggle with is: I know my flaws, I am aware of them, I want to get better and change myself but I don't take the required action for it. PROCRASTINATION. I fucking hate this feeling that I wasted my youth away.

A little about me: I am South Asian, studying in the US for a grad degree in Computer Science. Also, I am gay. One of the factors that contributed to coming here.

In 2019, I observed that I wasn't taking interest in my education by doing extra curriculars. Also I was stuck in this fucking stupid relationship where I knew the guy was never gonna love me back but I still was involved with him. He was in love with a girl and I was stupid even after realizing this, I stuck around. So, I got a 4.5 package through college placement, I thought that was what I deserved. Because I did not know everything, like python, machine learning, I didn't do any internships or projects. I had just scrapped by doing bare minimum and got a 8.48 CGPA. Also, I started losing hair, so I used to do this impulsive buzzcut that never looked good and made me feel like I was ugly.

In 2020, I was working on something like music and my body but then covid hit. I tried to make the best of it, but my relationship came crashing down. I got dumped on a text so he can be with the girl. And I remember being in so much pain, I couldn't get out of bed. I Netflix everything, ate/ordered junk food and didn't sleep at night. I used to sleep at 6 in the morning till 12pm. I even got sleep paralysis because of this. Somehow, I managed to graduate and joined my company late in December due to Covid. I had gained weight. I am 80 kgs now, 5 feet 6 inches and have started balding at this point. Also, I worked on music and although it wasn't even of mediocre quality, I put in a decent amount of work in it. like 2 months.

In 2021, after starting my job, initially, we were working from the office. I actually met some of my friends there. It felt good, like I was useful. But, we were given work from home due to covid and this resulted in me not being sincere at my job. I know it sounds like  I am giving excuses, but I was sitting without any projects assigned. I used to do nothing but watch Netflix and eat junk food. I was hating myself. I decided to use that free time in some interior decoration of my house and renovated it. I also didn't save any money. I spent it all on food. . I decided that I wanted to pursue masters, so I joined classes and my parents paid for the classes. I was supposed to come to the US in 2023, but I procrastinated. I treated  the classes as if they are my life's purpose. I pressured myself that I need to get 320+ and just kept pushing my exam date.

In 2022, the cycle continued. I was still single at this point, and mind you still involved with my ex on and off. I decided to do some quick methods for weight loss and spent almost a 1 lac on it. It did work, but I couldn't sustain it. I never scheduled my exam and procrastinated. I was given a good project at work, but because of my lack of work ethic and a toxic manager, I quit the project. I was on the bench for the rest of the year, since May.

In 2023, I actually booked my exam for May and got a mere 300 avg score. I rescheduled Tofel twice and spent twice the amount of money on it. I gained all my lost weight and I was fat again. I dated someone for a couple of months. I worked with an NGO and that made me feel good. I was also without any work at the office, sometimes I got POCs but I never actually learned anything.

In 2024, I got my admit and flew to the US in August. Before that it was all just prep for coming. I always thought this was a fresh start. This would change me, but no. I struggled everyday. I procrastinated on my assignments, and had friends help me. I got a mere 3.4 cgpa now. I was struggling for real. I thought I would get on campus to support myself, I didn’t. So, my parents helped me. I spent money on a laptop because I thought I would do programming on it, but I didn’t. I watched Netflix the whole time cause everytime I tried studying I felt dumb that I wasn't understanding. I couldn't keep up, I felt overwhelmed. Even my roommates noticed this. I kept calling my friends back home to feel connected with them. 

In 2025, I did better. I mean it wasn’t easy but, I put in the work, at least for assignments and stuff. But, I actually didn’t learn anything. I did get an on campus job when all my peers got internships. So while everyone was doing some good work in our domain, I was serving frozen food. Now, I turned 27 years old and I feel like I have not done anything in my life. My life is amounted to NOTHING. I am graduating soon and I don’t have any job prospects. 

My parents have given so much for me. I can’t let them down. But I do everyday. By just breathing, I am adding worry and tension in their life. I feel weak and a failure. Everyone has given up on me. Actually maybe they haven’t but I have. I cant figure out how to get out of this fuck hole. 



I know I struggle with these things below:

1. *Procrastination*: I plan, plan and plan. I talk and talk, but I never do the stuff I need to do. I now have 3 degrees and I know less than any new sophomore student would. If I get overwhelmed, I sleep/ listen to music. I am lazy. 
2. *Masturbation addiction*: I masturbate at least 2 to 3 times daily since Covid. It has fucked with my energy levels and my dopamine. I am actually ashamed to admit this. 
3. *Netflix and music*: I am always on my phone - Instagram doom scrolling, listening to music and pretending scenarios, daydreaming when i would be in shape, have my dream partner, living a dream life. Which changes with every song. Sometimes, it's travelling for living or sometimes it's a pop star, touring, recording, Grammy wins or sometimes it's owning a coffee shop in a small town, or sometimes it's living in NYC with my husband or sometimes it's going back and living alone.
4. *Money*: I have 0 financial planning. I spend money on food, Clothes that don't fit me, so it would be a motivation. I try to avoid spending money going out with my friends but I spend money eating alone. I hate borrowing money but I'm always begging for money because I spent it on a 30 dollar uber McDonald's one Tuesday when i was feeling overwhelmed. 
5. *Unhealthy lifestyle*: I am fat, starting to bald seriously now. I can’t do a single exercise, I get breathless easily. None of my clothes fit me. I eat when I feel overwhelmed and I normally am overwhelmed because I overthink. I don't sleep early and don’t wake up early.
6. *Hopeless romantic*: I hope to find someone, but I don't go out. I don’t like someone because they are not my type. I am not like gay gay, if you know what i mean. When I told my friends I was gay, all of them said, no one suspected it at all. I’m just a dude who likes guys. That's it. It's not my complete personality. I feel like I never even loved my ex, I just wanted him. Cause if i did, i would have let him go when he told me he didn’t feel the same way.

I do this every day. I say in 3 months I’ll turn my life around. I plan. No sugar. No junk food. Study everyday. Do projects, Make music. Work on myself, but then something happens.  One smallest failure and i give up. Back to my old ways. I keep thinking about my past decisions, my procrastination, get overwhelmed. I say, today i will sit with all my thoughts, figure my shit out, forgive myself anf then from tomorrow I will never dwell in my past. I will become a fucking new Person. I am always waiting for an EPIPHANY that will change my life like you see coming of age movies. Just that I have had all the epiphany's already, know what's wrong and still won’t change.

I hate myself. I hate this version of myself. I have had times where I was actually doing well in my life. Like working out, I really worked hard on a couple of my projects in the office. I travelled with my family. 

I need help. **How can I actually change my life? How do you start forgiving myself for all the time I have wasted in my life? How do I get my shit together? I know the answer is JUST DO IT. But still, some help would be appreciated.**



I don't know what my life would look like in 4 months or how am i gonna do it?

I know I need to get a job first and I need to upskill to get it. But, I always feel like when I start my study plan there is so much to do, how am I gonna do it in a limited amount of  time. And then I feel overwhelmed and then the cycle starts again.

Another day, another AI model to integrate into our coding workflow. Today, I'll show you how to set up Qwen 3 Coder Plus directly in Zed Editor. Because apparently, switching to a terminal to use AI is so 2023. Let's get this over with.

# What You'll Need

For this thrilling adventure, you'll need:

1. Qwen CLI installed (shocking, I know)
2. Zed Editor (because what else would you use?)

# Installing Qwen CLI

First, go get Qwen CLI from [here](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code). Once it's installed, you'll need to log in by typing `/auth` in your terminal. Or maybe the system will hold your hand and redirect you automatically. Who knows? Technology is unpredictable like that.

Note

**Fun fact:** The free version gives you 2000 daily requests with a limit of 60 requests per minute. How generous! It's almost like they want you to actually use their product.

# Installing Zed Editor

If you don't have Zed Editor yet, download it from [their website](https://zed.dev/download).

Note

**Minor inconvenience:** Zed only supports macOS and Linux at the moment. Windows users, I guess you'll just have to sit this one out. Maybe next time?

# Now for the Main Event

Assuming you've successfully installed both pieces of software (congratulations, by the way), let's make them talk to each other.

# Step 1: Open the Agent Panel

In Zed Editor, find and open the ""Agent Panel"". It's probably hiding somewhere obvious, but you know how it is with UI design these days.





# Step 2: Navigate to Settings

Once the panel is open, click the ""…"" icon at the top and select ""Settings"" from the menu. Because every application needs its own special snowflake settings page, apparently.





# Step 3: Add a New Provider

Scroll down in the settings page until you see ""LLM Providers"" and click the ""Add Provider"" button. From the dropdown that appears, select ""OpenAI"". Yes, I know you're setting up Qwen, but just go with it. This is how software works in 2023.





# Step 4: Configure API Details

Now we get to the fun part - copying and pasting cryptic strings of text!

1. First, we need to get your API key from the `~/.qwen` folder on macOS. Navigate there and you'll see a few files:





1. To read the ""oauth\_creds.json"" file, run `zed oauth_creds.json` in your terminal. You'll see something like this:





1. The `access_token` value in this file is your API key (I've conveniently hidden mine for security purposes, but yours will be there). You'll also need to copy the `resource_url` value.
2. Now, back to Zed. In the ""API URL"" field, enter [`https://portal.qwen.ai`](https://portal.qwen.ai) and add `/v1` at the end. So it should look like: [`https://portal.qwen.ai/v1`](https://portal.qwen.ai/v1)
3. In the ""API Key"" field, paste the `access_token` you copied earlier.
4. For ""Provider Name"", you can enter whatever you want. ""My Not-So-Secret AI Weapon"" perhaps?
5. In the ""Models"" section:
   * Set ""Model Name"" to `qwen3-coder-plus`
   * Set ""Max Completions Tokens"" to `1000000`
   * Set both ""Max Output Tokens"" and ""Max Tokens"" to `65536`
   * Check the ""Supports tools"" and ""Supports images"" boxes at the bottom
6. Finally, click ""Save Provider"". If everything went according to plan, it should look something like this:





# And That's It!

Congratulations! You can now talk to Qwen 3 Coder Plus directly in Zed Editor. No more terminal switching for you. Your coding workflow is now approximately 0.5% more efficient. The future is here!

**Bonus tip:** You can add other Qwen models using the same method. Just change the model name and adjust the token values accordingly. Because variety is the spice of life, or so they say.

# If Things Go Wrong

If you run into any issues following these instructions, feel free to email me at `fatih@etik.com`. I'll try my best to help, but no promises. Technology is fickle, and so am I before my morning coffee.

# Final Thoughts

Thanks for reading this guide. I hope it was helpful, or at least mildly entertaining. Now go forth and code with your fancy new AI assistant. Try not to let it take over your job completely.

Happy coding!

1nt3515,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1nt3515/why_people_pleasing_will_ruin_your_relationships/,Why people pleasing will ruin your relationships (I learned this the hard way),"I used to say yes to everything. Every request, every plan, every favor. I thought being agreeable would make people like me more.

Instead, I lost myself completely and watched my relationships fall apart one by one.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about people pleasing that nobody talks about:

You become invisible .When you never have opinions, preferences, or boundaries, people forget you exist. You're just the person who goes along with whatever. There's nothing interesting or memorable about you.

People lose respect for you. Deep down, everyone knows when someone has no backbone. They might use your niceness, but they don't respect it. Respect comes from knowing you'll stand up for what matters to you.

You attract the wrong people. Users, manipulators, and selfish people LOVE people pleasers. They can sense you won't say no. Meanwhile, healthy people get uncomfortable around someone with zero boundaries.

Your relationships become one-sided. You give everything, they take everything. Then you get resentful because ""you do so much for them"" but they never reciprocate. But you never asked them to—you just assumed they should.

Nobody knows the real you. How can someone love you if you never show them who you actually are? You're so busy being what you think they want that your real personality disappears.

You become exhausted and bitter. Saying yes when you mean no is emotionally draining. Eventually, you start resenting everyone for ""making"" you do things you chose to do.

How to break the cycle:

Start saying no to small things ""I can't grab coffee today"" or ""That movie isn't really my thing."" Practice with low-stakes situations first.

Express actual preferences like ""I'd prefer pizza over sushi"" or ""I'm not really into horror movies."" Let people know you have opinions.

Set tiny boundaries ""I don't check work emails after 8PM"" or ""I need 30 minutes to myself when I get home."" Start small and build up.

Stop apologizing for having needs ""I need to leave by 9"" not ""Sorry, I'm so lame but I have to leave early."" Your needs aren't an apology.

Some people will get upset when you stop people pleasing. Good. Those are the people who were only around because you were convenient.

The right people will respect you more for having boundaries. And you'll finally have space for relationships where you can be yourself.

Healthy relationships need two whole people, not one person and their shadow. That's my hard realization after years of people pleasing.",14,1759102713.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,0.94,False

It got to the point where I was worn out during the day, but I assumed it was just stress or ""getting older.""  
  
The following four minor details, in my opinion, had the biggest impact:  
  
Cutting off soda, tea, and coffee after 7 p.m. I would almost certainly wake up twice if I had anything later.  
  
 Lighter dinners, less salty. Meals that were heavy or salty woke me up more.  
  
I'm actually unplugging before bed. I typically only woke up once (or not at all) on nights when I chose to stretch and breathe rather than scroll.  
  
 Two trips to the bathroom before bed. Once before bed and once while getting ready. It may sound silly, but it was helpful.

I slept through the night for the first time in months after implementing these adjustments. Throughout the day, my concentration and mood have totally changed.  
  
 Has anyone else experimented with such minor evening adjustments? What did you find effective?

And the cool part is the teabag itself isn’t made from the regular material. 

Instead, it’s made from a whey protein film that dissolves in water, so no waste left behind (more eco-friendly, considering whey protein will break down into less harmful components compared to the regular material) and you get a little protein boost. The film is digestible btw.

1nt2w4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/MagdalenaBay/comments/1nt2w4r/second_sleep_lyrics/,Second Sleep lyrics,"TW: suicide

I’m looking into the lyrics of Second Sleep, and I can’t help but think it has to do with suicide. I don’t have an A+ interpretation, but I have to point out some lines which touch on this theme.

Clearly, the narrator is describing depression.

“Time to toughen up
Gotta get some help
Sun’s coming up
Put the coffee on, and shudder on out the door”

The narrator explains that they need help which is likely mental help. Additionally, the narrator explains that they have indulged in self-harm:

“I fall in love to hurt myself”

The narrator is self-punishing and describing that they are depressed. Additionally, they are yearning for something call “second sleep.”

If the original “sleep” is the typical unconscious we experience every night, “second sleep” might allude to a second possible instance of an unconscious experience: death, which is being conflated with the concept of dreams.

Additionally, the narrator evolves the idea of dreaming in two ways.

Originally… “If I don’t wake up, it’s all been a bad dream.”

This line illustrates the idea that there is a possibility of waking up, and if it doesn’t happen, life was just a bad dream, meaning it is (then) unideal, unreal, immaterial, which would be true once anyone is dead. 

Later… “If I don’t wake up, I’ll see you in my dreams.”

This line evolves the original meaning of dream by suggesting that there is an eternal, immaterial experience in an unconscious life. There is two planes: the conscious and unconscious. After death, the conscious world is a bad dream, and the unconscious is a typical dream, which has a good connotation, suggesting an ideal experience. Thus, the narrator is gravitating towards the idea of dreaming.

“Second sleep is calling out to me”

The narrator is describing tension within themselves concerning belonging to a conscious plane or eternally unconscious plane. The narrator is legitimately contemplating this idea.

“I’m suffering, do you feel this cold?
I’ll warm you up when we get to hell
….
It’s not natural
Yeah, and I really need help”

In the above line, we are made clear of a new dimension of this contemplation. The narrator wants to reconnect with their loved one (who is likely dead).

In tandem to this, the narrator says… “So far to get to where you are.”

There is massive gap between the unconscious and conscious, meaning the narrator knows that it isn’t each to just welcome second sleep. Additionally, the narrator knows that they are likely to wake up if they try second sleep, meaning they might not be willing to pull away from the conscious plane. 

This ties into the line that… “Love is so demanding” and “Love is when you’re winning”/“Love is when you’re bleeding”

The narrator points out that being in love dictates many of your thoughts and actions. It is a triumphant feeling, but it can also make you suffer. 

The last verse says that “love is when you are bleeding” and the songs closes with a musical breakdown that spirals and fizzles out and ends in a sigh. If we are to believe that the song is written in linearly, at the end of the song, the narrator has been called to second sleep, and they begin to bleed. The final sigh might be an indication of their final breath. 

Let me know what you guys think. I know I grasped a couple straws, but no one on genius has really offered a comprehensive interpretation yet.

1nt2vda,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1nt2vda/my_mum_doesnt_listen_to_me/,My mum doesn’t listen to me,"I’m 14F and my mum is 39. From what she’s told me about her childhood, I get why she sometimes acts the way she does. She was conceived by a drunk hookup and her dad wanted nothing to do with her. She didn’t care as she still had a father figure who she loved very much. She has an older sister (my auntie) who is in her early 40s (I don’t know her exact age) who she is close with, and two sisters from her dad’s side who she doesn’t talk to at all. I’ll get on to my auntie later. Basically, she met my dad through my auntie. They had my older sister, got married while pregnant with me, and divorced when I was just a baby.

After the divorce, my mum started dating this other guy who she works with. My dad started dating this girl, but their relationship didn’t last long (thankfully). My mum fell pregnant in 2014 with my little half sister. She was born 2 weeks after my birthday in April, 2015. After my little sister was born, my mum’s boyfriend started acting differently. He treated me and my older sister more like outcasts than his family. It was always known that my little sister had autism since she was little, which lead to my mum and her boyfriend to fuss over her more. When my mum was at work, her boyfriend would look after us (btw he is the same age as my auntie) and it always ended bad. He’d find a reason to shout at me, so I would just stand and cry. My older sister would shout back at him, so he’d call my mum to come home early from work. I don’t know when it switched, but at some point I’d shout at him and my older sister would cry when he shouted at her. I must’ve really stressed him out as when he called my mum, he would cry on the phone to her saying that I wouldn’t listen to him and he couldn’t handle me. One time, it was past my little sister’s bedtime, and he was too busy shouting at my older sister upstairs. I took her upstairs, with her tablet that she was watching. When we got upstairs, my older sister’s bedroom is straight ahead, so we could see them as her door was wide open. They were both on her bed, he had a hold of her rest and literally had her pinned to the wall while he shouted in her face. She was crying so much. I told my little sister to keep watching her tablet, and I took her to bed.

Then, my older sister was diagnosed with anxiety and OCD when she was around 10. Since I was “normal” (their words, not mine), I had to help look after my little sister. I feel like there were a lot of signs that I had something too. For example, I always (and still do) leave the cupboards open. I have always struggled to do basic things like keeping my bedroom tidy and actually tidying it up. I’m not saying I also have autism, but from what I’ve been told and what I’ve researched, I do have a lot of the traits for autism. I apologise if I get any of these wrong, and some are just things everyone does, but I’ll give a list.

— I always have to use a little spoon, never a big spoon.
— If someone asks or tells me to do something that I was going to do, I get upset and don’t do it.
— I don’t like loud noises, unless it’s my music through my headphones at full volume.
— Idk if these are stims, but I think they are. I basically pull, twist and play with my ear a lot. It makes it really red, but I tend to do it subconsciously. I also pull my hair often, sometimes a few strands will come out, but thats never worried me since I’m mixed race so my curly hair will fall out often. I do it mostly when I’m bored, but again, I don’t realise that I’m doing it.
— I wear the same clothes over and over again.
— I watch the same tv shows and movies over and over again.
— When I’m interested in something, it’s like I’m overly interested in it. I’ll research everything about it, and talk to people about it endlessly for hours, even if they don’t care and show lack of enthusiasm.
— (not entirely sure if this one is a trait) I pay attentions to small details that others wouldn’t notice.

Theres only a couple of these things that I probably don’t show in public, like the stims, although, I do play with my ear a lot in front of people, just not my hair. Anyways, I’ve always been very smart, so whenever someone congratulates me, it’s probably for something academic. Whenever I was feeling down, people would bring up how I’m so smart, or teachers would say that I’m a star student. I’ve always exceeded in everything I did, however I began to slowly give up on trying in school when I got to year 7 (grade 6). I went into that year in 2022.

In September 2023, I had an accident with my knee during PE. After that, it was never stable and I had to sit out a lot during PE. My mum took me to the A&E multiple times, but they just kept telling me that it was soft tissue damage. In November of the same year, my mum had broken up with her boyfriend.

Note: They did have an on and off relationship, but my mum always brought him back. They were going to get married once, but my mum called it off one night as me and him had an argument.

I was 12 at this time, and my older sister was 14. We were able to keep him away for good this time, as my we were older and could actually put our foot down. In 2024, when I was 13, we got an X-Ray for my knee. Nothing showed, so we got an MRI scan, and got a letter back pretty quickly. Turns out I had actually snapped my ACL, and the only reason I could walk on my leg was because A&E and shrugged me off 3 times, I had to get my own crutches and basically learned to walk again, all while unknowingly having a torn ligament. I got that news in August, and was also told I’d be having surgery, which was scheduled for November. At the end of August, it was my neighbour’s birthday party. My mum was invited, and so was her ex boyfriend since they were friends. They left together, and my dad stayed with me and my older sister, as my little sister also went to the party. When they got back, my dad left, my older sister went to bed and so did my little sister. My mum and her ex were both drunk. At the time, I would sleep downstairs often, so my mum asked if I was sleeping downstairs that night. I didn’t want her ex to stay the night, so I said yes, as he wouldn’t be allowed to sleep in my bed and wouldn’t be able to sleep downstairs if I was. My mum then asked if he was staying the night, or going home. He said to her “It’s up to you”, to which my mum replied, “No, it’s not up to me.” They didn’t really say much after that. My mum announced she was going to bed, and I didn’t know where he had went. I had a gut feeling that he was upstairs in my mum’s room, so I went up there. My coat was in her room with my phone in, so I used that as an excuse. When I got in there, I saw them in bed together. They weren’t doing anything, just looking like they were going to sleep. He was in his boxers, which really annoyed me. My mum laughed said something to me (can’t remember what) and we both laughed. I went back downstairs and began freaking out on the sofa. The weeks leading up the birthday party, I knew this would happen. There were times in the past where they were drunk and did iykyk. Her room is above the living room, so I soon heard them doing it. I started crying. I told my older sister, and began messaging my childhood best friend, as I knew she’d be awake. I left the house and sat outside in the back garden, messaging her. I told her I might leave and go for a walk (it was around 2am), so she told me to be careful as my area is dodgy at night. 5 minutes later (I could’ve been long gone by then) my mum came outside. She asked what was wrong. I told her that I could hear them, and she said she didn’t know what I was talking about. She said all she heard was the ring camera and the dog barking when she was trying to sleep. I told her to stop lying, because I heard them, and she got up, said f*** sake as she walked away and went inside, slamming the door behind her.

I didn’t talk to her for 4 days after that, but she eventually cornered me and asked for a hug, so I just gave up and hugged her. The same day, I slept to my best friend’s house and went out with her since she wouldn’t stop messaging me, begging me to go out. I told her everything Thats happened. When I got home the next morning, I took my mum’s phone to play Roblox with my little sister. When I got bored, something just told me to look at her messages. I know it was wrong for me to do so, but I had lost all trust in her already, so to me, there wasn’t much more for me to lose. I found countless texts between them, suggesting they might be together. Although it was more from his side, he said things suggesting that she also had something to do with it. I took photos on my phone, and then gave her phone back. I sat on the sofa downstairs, visibly upset. She asked what was wrong, so I asked if she was still with him. She said no, and asked why. I began reading out every message since they broke up from the photos on my phone. She got mad, and I got mad too as she had promised relentlessly that she wasn’t getting back with him. She knew I had been having dreams about them getting back together, and me running away, so at this point, I knew I wasn’t going to trust her again. I went on her walk with my sister and her friend after the argument, telling them both what happened. They did say I shouldn’t have gone through her messages, which I agreed with. I have said sorry for doing that, as it was an invasion of privacy. A couple days later, I was talking to her again. She said if I had read the messages properly, I would have seen that it was just him. I had indeed read the messages properly, and I knew it wasn’t just him, but I just said okay and we moved on from it. Since then, I have continued to have dreams about them getting back together, and me running away. Then, they shifted into dreams where I would hurt him nonstop. The last dream I can remember of me hurting him, he was stood in our kitchen. I kept throwing things at him from the bench. He didn’t do anything, he just stood there. Then, I picked up a knife, and threw it at him. However, the dream ended before it could actually hit him. I then had a dream where I cornered my mum in the living room. I punched her and hit her, while she just covered her face with her hands.

Recently, I’ve stopped going to school. I stopped towards the end of year 9 (8th grade) after picking my GCSE options. I don’t know why Ive stopped, but I do know that my mental health is bad. The fourth week of school in year 10 (9th grade) starts tomorrow, and I’ve been in school for a total of 2 hours so far. I have seen the counsellor, who suggested that I could have autism. She suggested that, as I would tell her about my argument with my little sister, and how I always retaliated if she hit me. I would hit her back, push her off me, and shout for my mum. My mum always tells me to call for her if my little sister throws a tantrum, so I do, but she takes about 20 years to actually come. She’s always told me not to retaliate, and Ive told her I can’t help, and she says I just have to try. Like…I do try. Anyways, the counsellor said that it seems like I struggle to get along with my sister, because we’re so alike. She told my mum about it, with my permission, and my mum actually listened. Whenever I tried to tell her that I believed there was something wrong with me, she’d tell me there’s nothing wrong. The counsellor also made me take some test, quiz things. I scored high in both OCD and depression. My mum has called Life cycles to get me some help, we’re just waiting in a phone call to see who I actually need to talk to.

 So, about an hour ago, I was talking to my mum. We have spoke about how she thinks if I have anything, it’s probably bipolar disorder, as I have had multiple outbursts, and after Ive calmed down, I act like nothing happened. I did more research on it the night before, and I learned about manic episodes and depressive episodes. I feel like maybe I am bipolar and not autistic, as I do have a manic episodes, which quickly turn into depressive episodes. I’ll talk for hours about something, and get really hyper. However, I will quickly lock myself in my room and not talk to anyone. I recently out a hole in my little sister’s door by throwing a drill. I didn’t intend to hit her door, but it did. I threw paint down the stairs, so my mum had to take off the carpet and spent money getting a new one. I’ve thrown other things down the stairs too in the past. I destroyed my bedroom once. I broke my tv, my wardrobe and threw a vase. Apart from throwing the drill, all of these things were the results of arguments I had. I threw the drill because my little sister annoyed me. However, I sometimes feel like my emotions because too much, which is why I threw the drill. Anyways, I told my mum that I did research. I didn’t get to finish my sentence before she said “Researching things makes you think you have them. Leave it to Life cycles to figure out.” This slightly annoyed me as I had clearly went back in my mind of all the times I believe I’ve had a manic episode, which have turned into depressive ones. She asked why I don’t go to school, to which I said “ I don’t know”. My friends also ask why don’t go, and I give them the same answer every time, so they get annoyed and I do too. My mum said there has to be a reason, and I said that I don’t know it. My counsellor thinks it’s because the work is too easy for me, as I’m quite smart. She also thinks it’s because that I missed some time off school, so now I feel like I can’t go back because I’ve already missed too much. I don’t know why, but I tend to agree with what other people say. So if when they think I’m not going to school for this reason, I’ll either shrug my shoulders or agree. My mum said that she can tell by the way people look at her that they’re thinking “You don’t have control over your own child. You can’t even get her to school.” I asked her who thinks that, as she said the school, and that if she told people about me, they’d think that. I said like *our neighbour’s name*. My mum said that she doesn’t tell her about me. I said yes she does, as there was one time where our neighbour said something, that clearly meant my mum had told her how I have trouble sleeping. I told my mum that I don’t like when she tells our neighbour about me, as it’s none of her business. Also, our neighbour just annoys me. It may sound a bit dramatic and extreme, but I really want her to die. One time, my mum had been cleaning the house. I was in the living room, watching YouTube. Not once did my mum ever ask me to help her. She never asks me to help her, and when she does, I always help. Plus, she likes to be left alone when she’s cleaning. The neighbour came in for a quick coffee and proceeded to make comments about me. She told me to stop being lazy, to get up and to help my mum. I ended up just ignoring her and she left. So, I do hope she dies, and this is what I mean when I said I can’t control my emotions. I told my mum how much I hate the neighbour, and I told her to stop telling her about me. So, when I mentioned my neighbour to my mum an hour ago, my mum said she doesn’t talk about me to her. I brought up a couple weeks ago on a Saturday. It was 11:20am when my mum stood at the back door and answered her call, and 11:23am when my mum began talking about me to her. She was basically telling her how I still wasn’t going to school and the school wasn’t giving me a part timetable like they said they would. I took note of the time, and have stored it in my memory ever since. When I talked about that phone call, my mum didn’t say anything, which is what she does when she knows she’s been caught out on a lie. She told me that she hopes at least one of her three children will stay in school and not get home schooled. That annoyed me, as I knew she was trying to guilt trip me. I didn’t say anything, but in every argument we have, she tries to guilt trip me, and does the same to my older sister (16 years old btw) when she needs money.

Basically, I don’t know what to do anymore. She always lies and tries to guilt trip us when she isn’t getting her way. She always calls my auntie a narcissist, which I can see, but I feel like maybe she is one too. I’m only 14, so know there isn’t much that I can do, but it’d still be nice to hear other people’s thoughts on this. Also, my mum says she was always the favourite child growing up, as my auntie was the trouble maker and she was an angel. She’s also in the past called me her golden child, but the older I get, the more I see through her lies and words.",2,1759101953.0,WhatShouldIDo,2,1.0,False

I don't think I have ever seen another team as bad as this one unquestionably was with as good a pitching staff as the 2025 Pirates unquestionably had.  And keep in mind, they were almost as good even after they dealt their closer and top lefthanded setup man at the trade deadline.  Meanwhile they held onto mostly-useless-in-Pittsburgh veterans like IKF and Andrew Heaney---until they didn't.  Two other veteran free agents, Tommy Pham and Adam Frazier, didn't excite anyone when they signed here but honestly worked out about as well as they could have given their age and pedigree.  Meaning, they were....well, they were okay.  Then the front office turned around and traded a controllable and reasonably effective lefthanded starter in Bailey Falter for next to nothing, though he stunk out the joint in his new digs, so maybe it was no great loss.

The players they got in return at the trade deadline look like a pile of meh except for Flores, though he probably isn't quite ready to play on a regular basis in the major leagues just yet. That's Henry Davis over in the corner who is breathing a sigh of momentary relief, but next year is surely his last chance to be anything other than a glove first backup going forward.  (He is good defensively, though, for sure.)  Speaking of good gloves, Jared Triolo certainly played much better once he get in there every day, but does that mean he can start at short or third for a year or two?  Probably not.  Spencer Horwitz was easily our best hitter by the end of the season and he's pretty good, but not the kind of guy you typically look to as the quintessential middle of the order bat.  Bryan Reynolds managed 38 doubles and almost 80 RBI in his worst full season, and was probably hurt early on.  If he returns to form in 2026, he and Horwitz are fairly good building blocks.  Not great, but decent.  And....

That's about it.

Nick Gonzales limped to the finish line with a substandard .660-ish OPS.  That's not good enough for a guy whose bat is supposed to be his calling card.  O'Neil Cruz started off well but was terrible from late May until the last day of the season.  How much of that was due to injury?  Who knows?  Of the minor leaguers who got called up, Nick Yorke looked....okay, not terrible, but he's also not setting the world on fire.  From here he appears to have a good enough hit tool to play in Pittsburgh, but is also a guy who doesn't really have a position, and he doesn't have enough home run power to be your DH.  Billy Cook had a cup of coffee thanks to a midyear surge but then got hurt and sank out of sight.  Cam Devanney is not a major league hitter, that's quite clear.  Of the other minor leaguers, Konnor Griffin will certainly play in Pittsburgh next season unless he has an unprecedented fall-on-his-face performance next spring.  Phenom players like him have come up from the minors and hit the ground running before, but unless he is the next Bryce Harper (and he might be?), he won't be enough to lift the team as a 20 year old rookie.

But there's still that really good pitching staff, especially the starting rotation.  And there are still a few more arms in the minors who could sweeten the deal in a trade for more hitting.  The obvious move is to trade Mitch Keller and an A-ball lottery ticket for an established bat at a corner outfield spot or third base. It wouldn't hurt to sign a second professional hitter type at whatever position they don't fill with this hoped-for swap. Unfortunately at the moment it looks like it will be up to Ben Cherington to make that kind of a deal for the Pirates.",0,1759101814.0,buccos,4,0.5,False

I was dead wrong.

Everything you're struggling with traces back to this one thing you're probably ignoring.

Can't focus? No motivation? Emotional trainwreck over small things? one answer. F\*cked up sleep schedule.

I used to think I was ""not a morning person"" and that discipline was for people with better genetics. Turns out I was just chronically sleep-deprived and calling it personality.

Going to bed at random times is like constantly changing time zones. Your hormones, energy, and decision-making all sync to consistent timing. Mess with the timing, mess with everything.

Every bad habit you can't break? Every good habit you can't stick to? Sleep debt makes your prefrontal cortex (impulse control center) work at 50% worse. You're trying to build discipline with a broken tool.

If you struggle to sleep do this:

1. Pick ONE bedtime and defend it like rent money. Mine is 10:30pm. Non-negotiable.
2. Reverse-engineer your evening. Work backwards from bedtime. Dinner by 8pm, screens off by 9pm, wind-down routine starts at 10pm.
3. Morning light exposure within 30 minutes of waking. This sets your circadian clock. Skip coffee, get sunlight first.

Every successful person I know treats sleep like a business meeting with themselves. They don't negotiate, they don't make excuses, they just show up.

1nt2t77,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nt2t77,October is gonna be tasty!!,"September is my birthday month and the B&W was a gift from me to me. It arrived Friday just before we headed out of town for a family weekend getaway to Branson, MO for a trip to Silver Dollar City amusement park. 

My wife booked the trip and little did we know that Echelon Coffee’s cafe would be in the same parking as our hotel in Springfield, MO. It’s a 45 minute drive from Branson but was $100 cheaper per night in hotel cost. 

Echelon is a cool cafe with beans roasted up the street by the owner. Had the Geisha as a pourover Saturday morning before heading to the amusement park. 

At the park there are never ending arts and craft vendors. Kinda felt like a Cracker Barrel with rides which we enjoyed it. Not 100 yards inside the entrance is an open-air coffee roaster called Cavern Coffee. They give samples (1/2 oz) of their coffee in either hot or cold brew. I’m a flash brew drinker so I went with the cold brew. Needless to say, I left the park with a bag of their Guatemala. Was not expecting a roaster to be in an amusement park and when I asked if I could buy a full size drink the lady (presumably the owner) stated “I wish we could.” It was a good daily driver type coffee. Amusement park pricing, but my “souvenir” from the park. 

After checking out of the hotel this morning I stopped back at Echelon for another pourover and grabbed a bag of beans, which is under the name No Coast Coffee. 

These will all rest until about the 10th, and I’ll likely freeze some of the two B&W beans to have at later times. I’ve got some Wilton Benitez Pink Bourbon, which is part of the Future blend, and some Onyx Doyenne I got on a recent trip to Sam’s Club in Bentonville, to hold me over until the 10th-ish.

Last January, after another month of wondering where my money went, I decided to track EVERY single transaction for a full year. Not just categories in a budget app, but literally documenting every coffee, every impulse Amazon purchase, every bill in a detailed spreadsheet.

The results were honestly shocking. I discovered:

1. I was spending nearly $300/month on convenience store stops (energy drinks, snacks, etc.)
2. My ""occasional"" food delivery was actually averaging $430/month
3. I had 7 subscription services I barely used totaling $86/month

The most eye-opening part wasn't even the big numbers, but seeing how the small daily purchases added up. That $4.75 coffee 3-4 times a week was over $800 a year.

After six months of tracking and gradually changing habits, I went from saving basically nothing to consistently putting away $650/month. I've built my first-ever emergency fund ($5,800 so far) and started contributing to my 401k beyond the employer match.

Has anyone else tried obsessive expense tracking? Did it change your behavior? Any tips for maintaining this habit long-term? I'm worried I'll slip back into old patterns when the novelty wears off.",649,1759101584.0,povertyfinance,50,0.98,False

We have one child who is 6. We knew each other vaguely and briefly from years prior in a completely different state because we happened to work at the same place. I guess around 2011/2012 we both went through bad break ups and had the opportunity to move to a new state for a fresh start. Keep in mind, we hardly k ew each other prior and due to work and didn’t keep in touch after that job so neither of us would know the other person was moving or what state they were moving to. Anyways, I move to a new state, been there about a month or so and I happen to see someone in a store that looks vaguely familiar to me which is strange because I live in a new state and I shouldn’t know anybody. I eventually said he looked familiar to me but I couldn’t place him. He said there was no way I’d know him as he just moved to this state a week earlier. Out of curiosity I asked where from and he said the same state I’d just moved from. I pictured different hair/facial hair on him and it clicked that I knew him from 5 years prior at a brief job we both had. I told him and we both kind of laughed about it and he asked if I’d like to get coffee as it was weird but nice to see a kind of familiar face. I said sure because I kind of felt the same about a kind of familiar face. We hung out and then kept hanging out everyday. Honestly I wasn’t attracted to him at all I was just lonely and in a new place and he lived with roommates and I thought maybe that would be a good way to meet new people and friends. We hung out a lot for a couple weeks and then he very casually said “I don’t plan on trying to date anyone else, what about you?” And then I realized he thought we were seeing each other. (There is a slight side quest story that I don’t want to go I to but here is where I will tell you that I was 200lbs heavier than I currently am now.) due to my weight/self esteem and loneliness, I figured, eh so what he had no job, no car, no money, and lives in his friends basement at the moment but why not, I’m not a prize. So I said yeah alright. At this point we just got comfortable in the relationship. I had a career and he bounced from job to job, McDonald’s, server, warehouse, etc. nothing was ever stable with him. When we moved in together after dating for 4 years, he had an over night serving job and he worked a good amount. I still had my career. He bought a beater truck for like $800 and of course it broke so he had to use my car for work. We never went anywhere or did anything and he always claimed it was due to money and our schedules since I work a typical 9-5 and he works nights and weekends. I guess I accepted that. I used to BEG for s3x and he would give me every excuse not to and then I’d always catching him watching p0rn or in p0rn/mutual play chat rooms. He would make excuses that our schedules are different and he isn’t going to wake me up and he can take care of it faster. I guess I accepted that. I remember wanting to get myself together and lose weight and I asked him how he felt about me getting weight loss surgery and he got incredibly angry with me and just simply would say he doesn’t support that. So I didn’t bring it up anymore but kept trying diet after diet because I wanted to get healthy and I wanted to lose weight because I’ve struggled my whole life with it. After a year of living together, I came home from work and let him know his tax return check had been deposited that day. He was sitting on the back porch smoking a cigarette as he was about to get my car keys from me and got to work. He puffed a few more times and shrugged and said “you wanna get married?” And I thought he was joking so I rolled my eyes and gave him the keys and walked inside. He followed me in and said he wasn’t joking, but I had to find and but my ring because “he is old fashioned and doesn’t know how to use a computer or phone to order things” so I found and got a ring. It got delivered and I had to sign for it. I brought it into the room where he was still sleeping at 1pm and tapped him and let him know it was there. He took it and put it on his night table and rolled over. He slept 2 more hours, woke up, went to the bathroom, walked into the living room and tossed me the box while he yawned and said “here ya go”…he got ready and left for work. We got married and moved to a new state to be by my folks as they are getting older. This was HIS choice. He said he felt it would help with my depression because he worked a lot and I was lonely. Once we moved here, he wouldn’t let me drive anywhere, we have lived here for almost 7 years and I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve been allowed to drive. He hates going out and doing things. He hates being around people like hanging out with people. He didn’t want me to hang out with my family so anytime we would, he always made an excuse that we had to leave early or right away. I have never been able to go out and do something by myself since we moved here. If I do go out, my mom picks me up and he will give me a guilt trip about how much he is going to miss me and how lonely it is when I’m gone because I am his only friend. He then will call me several times while I am out to see what I am doing and when I am coming home. Remember how I had to beg for s3x? He gave it up on our dating anniversary and I ended up accidentally preggo. Had my kid which triggered a wicked auto immune disorder. He ate a Pb&j while I pushed to deliver our kid. Due to my auto immune disorder my doc suggested weight loss surgery because I needed to get weight off my joints quick to help with pain. He told me he still didn’t agree with it or support it. I did it anyways. I lost 200lbs and have kept it off and let me tell you, HE is the one begging for s3x now. It is CONSTANT. He doesn’t have a job and hasn’t for a while now. I still have my career and work from home, which keeps me even more isolated. He basically filled me around all day trying to do something s3xual to me. He has bought crazy toys and pills and gels etc and is constantly touching me. About 2.5 years ago, I told him no I did want to have s3x and we ended up in a 6 hour argument where he told me that s3x was the only thing we had in common and that it is all he thinks about and wants and that i am his wife and need to give it to him and if for some reason I can’t have s3x there are other things I can do and should do as my “wifely duties” and I would like to say that once I’d lost weight we were having s3x at least twice a week and it always lasted an hour or 2. It isn’t like I wasn’t give him any at all. This fight has continued to happen. It is such a cringey feeling that he starts such a big fight about it and the fact that he feels entitled to and expects me to bend whenever he commands is gross! I can feel my entire body tense when he enters a room. My stomach turns to a knot when he touches me and I have to give myself and entire day worth of pep talk to convince myself to have s3x with him just to keep him from getting mad and starting another fight. He cannot keep a job and has been unemployed for over 3 years now and blames my mom because she took our kid to her first movie in a theater and he wanted to do that because his dad used to take him and his bro to the movies all the time. He caused an outrageous fight between me and my family which I swear at this point feels like it was to further isolate me. We are super broke as I pay all the bills since he doesn’t work. My phone pings a lot with over draft notices and I will say something to him and he will just keep scrolling his phone and walk off. I cook, clean, take care of the kid, work a full time job, pay ALL the bills…he drops the kid off and picks the kid up from school and sleeps all day. Due to my auto immune disorder I can’t take over the counter pain meds so I was prescribed a medical mj card. I’ll get some and he just smokes it all day long! One day my phone is going off non stop with over draft notices and he is smoking bowl and bowl and I had basically nothing left and I was keeping it for sleep. He came back inside to get more and I got upset and said “can you just stop please?” And he said “yeah I can wait until you are off work” and he went to take a nap while I finished my work day. He doesn’t do laundry because he doesn’t know how and refuses to let me teach him. He doesn’t clean the house because “it doesn’t bother him and it isn’t that bad” he never did dishes because they were gross. I finally convinced him if he will keep the dishwasher unloaded I will load it. I still have to tell him all the time, several times that it needs to be unloaded. He doesn’t want to mow the lawn he doesn’t want to fix any of the things that need some maintenance. He can’t apply for jobs or take an online course because he is “old school” and doesn’t know how to work a computer or smart phone. He quit smoking cigarettes right before our kid turned one and I was really proud of him. He said I had done a lot of work on myself mentally and physically and he wanted to do work so he quit smoking. Again, he doesn’t work, he hasn’t worked, and it’s because he says everyone picks on him at jobs and he is targeted. I went in the back yard the other day when I took a break from work and found him hiding behind a tree smoking a cigarette, very financially responsible choice considering he is contributing barely anything and the silent numbness that has consumed me for years now, the constant tension of walking on eggshells…melted and I realized, this man has drained me for almost 15 years. I have nothing left to give him. He hates dates, he hates concerts, he hates sports, he hates hanging out with people, he hates trips or vacation…and I cannot enjoy or do any of these things without him because I will get a guilt trip about him being lonely and not having friends, about how he just wanted to hang out with me. I am miserable with him. We have absolutely nothing in common except our child. He also talks NON STOP and I’ve gotten so quiet because he speaks over me and for me the majority of the time. He also thinks he is incredibly smart and knows more than anybody else and says awful things about people, like they aren’t as smart as him or he could have done it better. I was raised in a very religious household and I still believe in God but struggle with religion. He does not believe in God at all. Our kid wanted to pray for him because he had a headache because our kids grandmother prayed for our kid when they didn’t feel good. My spouse decided to spiral into a loud rant to our kid about how God isn’t real and the Bible is just a story book and prayer doesn’t work. I don’t agree with this but I also don’t know how to approach it because I am so tired of everything I say being an argument. He tells me all the time he loves me and is in love with me and he constantly rubs on me and kisses on me no matter what I am doing and he is always trying to get some. But it feels strange the way he says and does it. Our kid laughed and made the statement “mommy, daddy loves you so much he doesn’t let you leave the house” and he says things to our kid in front of me like “you are such a lucky kid because your mom and dad love each other so much we will be together forever and you will never know what it’s like yo have divorced parents” …I don’t know what to do. I feel so trapped and isolated but he is doing it in such a weird way that I feel like a bad person for wanting to leave him. Any advice helps!

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

I am a 22F who downloaded hinge for the first time in July 2025. So around mid July I match with this guy, let’s call him Bob, 34M. Bob and I chat for about 2-3 days. Nothing inappropriate or suggestive, literally chatting about the city we both live in and the weather. I decide I don’t want to date anymore after an irreverent experience and delete the app. Therefore I deleted our convo without saying goodbye. This cut off all communication with Bob because I never gave him my number or social medias. I work in a retail store, it’s a storefront on one of the main streets in my city. It’s a very popular, well known brand but a way smaller store in comparison to other stores the brand has. I notice Bob come into my store multiple times after I cut off communication. I didn’t notice Bob too much at first because I never had a reason to, the first times he came in, I hadn’t even realized it was him. Bob never buys anything, he comes in, doesn’t talk to the employees, doesn’t try anything on, never buys anything. Just sort of lingers. This occurs a few times within a month to two months. There’s not many other stores aside from Sephora and like small food businesses in the area just bars and food places. Last week, I decided to redownload hinge and Bob comes up as one of my first likes. I rematch with Bob and we start talking again on Tuesday. Our chat is normal, we talk about my job( unfortunately my location and workplace is mentioned) , my hobbies, his job, and basic stuff like good coffee places in the area. Bob begins to recall details about our past chat in July, it’s been almost two months since that. I don’t think anything of it. On Saturday night, so about 5 days into talking again, I am leaving my job and walking down the block with my other two coworkers when I get a message from Bob on hinge saying that he just passed me on the street and was very sure it was me. I think this is very weird. Mainly because we’ve never met in person, we’ve never gone a date before so how does he notice me ina group with my co workers, at 9:30 pm. If he did pass me it must’ve been quickly and roughly just a couple seconds. I am creeped out by this so by Sunday night, I end things. I send a text to Bob, Sunday night basically saying i wasn’t feeling the connection and wished him the best. He replied kindly on Monday morning …. But by Monday evening, 6pm, as I and my coworker were getting ready to close the store…Bob comes in. I am in the back when he comes in so I did not see him initially at all. The store is fairly quiet, it’s only like 3 other people looking around, my coworker, me and Bob. Bob is lingering by the men’s section, looking but not too intently. Not asking any questions (most men ask questions about the pant wall at our shop!) , not trying anything on, not picking his head up to look around, just lingering in one spot. I didn’t notice him at all, or who he was, so I continue my night as usual, chatting with my coworker, arranging some shelves literally right next to Bob. He lingers for another 10 minutes before I walk back to the register and before he walks out, he picks his head up and we make the most intense, terrifying eye contact. his face was expressionless but wide eyed. He then left the store and I haven’t seen him since … it’s been a week. 

I need some advice on how to proceed. Is this potentially a stalking / creep situation? 

I have a bad gut feeling. What can I do to protect myself? If anyone has gone through something similar, I’d appreciate the help 

Edit —/ I also want to mention, while I am starting to recall Bob coming into the store before our original hinge match in July… I noticed him coming in a lot more after I ended our first match in July/august ",1,1759101134.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I took them 4 days to it. What I didn't realize fully, that the water was shut down all this time. I panicked a bit. I only had bottles which I filled with tap water to make some tea of coffee. Luckily a day later i noticed they brought a small chemical toilet cabin outside to do my business when I need to.

That got me thinking: what can we do when an emergency strikes and toilets won't function for at least 7 to 14 days, or even longer? I thought about storing water in jerrycans, but flushing a toilet takes a lot of water... I live in an apartment in a big city, so space is a at a premium here.

1nt2k1d,https://i.redd.it/x2bysydlmzrf1.png,Most of my joy lately comes from the moments I used to avoid,"The magic benefits of boredom (from someone who HATES being bored)…
These days, a lot of us are almost afraid of boredom.
The second we sit in silence, random worries or useless thoughts start rushing in.
So we grab our phones, throw on headphones, or scroll just to block out the noise.
But as someone who really struggled with this, I noticed something surprising: when I actually let myself be bored, some pretty amazing things happen:

1. Unexpected solutions to my problems show up.
2. Way more creativity at work.
3. I feel more grateful and present in life + relationships.
4. Positive thoughts pop up on their own.
5. I trust my gut more and actually act on it.
And honestly? That’s not small stuff.

Most of my joy lately comes from making space for silence, stillness and yes, even boredom.

My favorite ways to “get bored”:
• Driving around with no destination, just looking around.
• Walking without my phone or headphones.
• Sitting on the couch in the comfiest position possible.
• Hanging out in a coffee shop with no phone, no distractions.

So I was not moving on from my break up but my ex was involving into other relationships.,,,and it hurted me a lot.so I decided to go out with new people so I can move on from that break up.,so I tried to find man in Instagram but there is no such people.so I installed Tinder and made a account there.And within a few minutes I got lots of matches,and texted.And I was looking there so I see the face of my ex's friend, whose face I knew before but I didn't know the name.and I was not aware that if we swip the right then it means we like them.And I was swiping all the faces which comes in front of my eyes.so I right swiped to my ex's friend too.AnD he texted,at first introduction,then talked about the places of his state ( He was from pink city of inda) and after that I told him that I saw him before seeing in tinder.and through this he knew that he is my ex's friend.and he stared to shared that he had fight with my ex almost 2 months ago and they don't talk anymore.my was not good guy ,and he  talked shit about my ex.
Well after a long conversation he wanted to share contacts.And he asked me that what am I looking for in Tinder,so I said I'm feeling not good so I thought if I meet or talk to new people then maybe I'll feel good.And I asked the same question to him and he said relationship.,and he also mentioned that he wanted friendship with me and if possible then more than friends.But I took it lightly like I was unaware of his words,his thoughts.
So we shared contacts after talking one day,I mean first day we just talked in Tinder,and 2nd day I shared contact, cz he himself shared his contact for the first day of talking.and we texted in WhatsApp,like he anytime texted me,shows too much interest,and shows that how much he likes me,and shows that he is a good man so I can trust him blindly.And after 3 days I went to hospital and coming from the hospital I went to pharmacy to purchase sone medicine and at that time I saw his WhatsApp text that where are you.
So I replied that near medical College.,then he asked alon,so I replied yes alone.
He said that he wants to meet me and coming to meet me,but I said no I'm in hurry,I can't meet you.
He said he just inside the library of medical College.,just be there with me within 3 minutes,but still I didn't said that I wanna meet him that day.but he comes just in 2-3 minutes,and he said let's go for coffee,so we went to coffee....

Not only did she know but she and her husband sang at the funeral.

I replied 'so why did she put the announcement in the paper?'.  Crickets . I told her again that it hurt and that she had lied to me, a lie of omission.

As per board rules I can't offer any payment but I am happy to treat you to a coffee or drink if you would like to meet up beforehand to decide if you are comfortable shooting, for example.

1nt2ai3,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy_books/comments/1nt2ai3/the_codex_of_hollow_saints_a_dark_fantasy_tale/,The Codex of Hollow Saints (A Dark Fantasy Tale),"San Francisco, 1994. 

Nob Hill slept behind its gates and hedges, but deep in the guts of the city, the old tides still surged made of time, secrets, and souls half faded from paper and bone.

Jasper Cortes ran a rare bookshop tucked into a sunless crevice off Taylor Street, nestled between a Russian Orthodox chapel that no longer held services and a defunct elevator operator's union hall. The shop bore no sign, and those who found it rarely stumbled in by accident. He called it Lexicon's Wake, a joke no one else laughed at.

He specialized in apocryphal volumes, not just theological fringe, but true arcana: grimoires that bled ink when scratched with fingernail; Civil War spiritualist manuals annotated in rust blood script; a copy of Gray's Anatomy that grew new plates after midnight. He did business by appointment, or apparition as he liked to remark.

The day it all began, a stranger entered the shop at exactly 4:44 p.m.

She wore a charcoal coat and thick soled boots, her hands wrapped around a long archival box. Her voice was calm, but her eyes carried the glassy look of someone who'd focused too deeply on something dangerous. 

""Is this real?"" she asked, setting the box down. ""I found it under Grace Cathedral.""

Inside was a black codex bound in a material too smooth for leather. An ivory slipcase bore a sigil like a fishhook caught in a thornbush. Jasper froze. The Codex Sanctis Vacui.

He had dreamed of it for years.

""Where exactly did you find this?""

""I was helping with a restoration. I'm Evangeline,"" she said. ""I used to be a nun.""

They examined the Codex together, Jasper cautious, Evangeline calm but trembling just beneath it. She'd left the Immaculate Blood cloister after a vision during a midnight vigil: saints in stained glass that bled ink instead of light. She had studied codicology in Rome, but came back fractured and fledgling. She knew her relics. But this book was no relic.

The moment they opened it on his iron reading slab, the room grew colder.

It spoke in a language that wasn't quite Latin, not quite Enochian. Marginalia twisted across the pages, rewriting themselves as they read. Jasper saw a name in the margin, his, but misspelled in a way that made his stomach turn.

He started bleeding from his ear. Evangeline started speaking in her sleep.

They didn't dare sleep near it again.

The Hollow Saints came next.

They didn't knock. They didn't call. They arrived in smudged mirrors and elevator reflections, in antique fonts on signs that hadn't been there yesterday.

* Saint Adrimon, martyr of unreal causes, who fed on forgotten martyrdom.
* Saint Cherit, archivist of sins not yet committed.
* Saint Gadderal, the Stillborn Witness, who recorded deaths before they occurred.

They came for the Codex. And with them came the not priest—a man in cassock and collar who bore a communion tin of human teeth, each etched with a saint's false name.

""It doesn't belong to you,"" the not priest said. ""It belongs to them. It was written to anchor them.""

""We're not giving it up,"" Evangeline said, her voice cracking like old vellum.

They fled that night when the Codex turned a page on its own.

Jasper led them to Chinatown, to a forgotten shop beneath Grant Avenue where reality buckled around incense smoke and dying languages. Yee Heong's Apothecary and Historical Archive, hidden beneath a fireworks stand and guarded by a clock with no hands, was older than the quake and deeper than the sewers. Its owner, Yee Heong, was 102 and spoke only in whispers. He'd been a railroad herbalist, an exorcist, and a forger of holy paperwork.

""Why here?"" Evangeline asked as they descended into the basement, fog still clinging to her coat.

""Because he remembers saints that were almost canonized,"" Jasper said. ""And he knows how to trap a story before it finishes writing itself.""

Inside, among cabinets of dried cicadas and contracts with dead gods, they made camp. Three days. Sleepless. Breathing only dust and time.

On the second night, Evangeline found a wall of yellowed ancestral death papers—contracts folded in thirds and sealed with old coins.

""They bury them under businesses,"" she murmured. ""To weigh down the dead. So they don't float up and start talking.""

Jasper stood beside her. ""We're doing the opposite.""

""They rise from misremembering,"" she said. ""The Hollow Saints were never real. But enough belief, enough print, and they push their way in sideways.""

He looked at her, at the tired, ink smudged curve of her face, and something in him shifted. She touched his wrist and whispered, ""The book's showing me other versions of myself. I think it wants me to forget which one is real.""

That night they kissed beneath the humming fluorescents and lantern dust. In that moment, they were two people trying to rewrite fate with touch.

At midnight, something pounded on the ceiling from the street above—something with too many knees and a preacher's rhythm. Yee Heong drew sigils on the floor with hair ink and laid down postage stamp wards.

Evangeline tightened her rosary like brass knuckles. Jasper clutched a silver blade hidden in a hollowed out Melville first edition.

They sat back to back, fingers laced.

""If I don't make it,"" she whispered, ""burn my name out of the Codex.""

""You think I could do that?""

""I think you're already in it. You just haven't turned that page yet.""

Eventually, the Hollow Saints cornered them, back where it had started, Grace Cathedral, beneath the rose window, where the acoustics warped sound into something dangerously like belief.

They opened the Codex on an altar made from Alcatraz driftwood. Its pages fluttered like hungry wings.

The Hollow Saints formed—half ink, half invocation, drawing flesh from marginalia and broken prayers. The not priest chanted in mirrored Latin, unraveling grammar itself.

Jasper and Evangeline fought it not with swords, but with language. She reversed the Codex aloud in a tongue stitched together from Vatican blacklists and half remembered hymns. He poured blessed ink into its spine, page by page.

But it wasn't enough.

So Jasper kissed her one last time and tore out the page that bore her name.

The Hollow Saints screamed—not in pain, but in absence. And then they vanished.

So did she.

Now, Jasper runs a different kind of shop. He rarely opens. Mostly he waits.

Sometimes he smells myrrh in the fog. Sometimes he hears a prayer that rhymes with her name.

The Codex is gone, shelved in the fiction section of UC Berkeley's library under Powers, T., where no one will believe it's real.

But he knows better.

Some pages, once written, never quite stop.

And some saints, once loved, never quite fade.

April, 1995. San Francisco warmed in a way it hadn't in years. Not the temperature—though spring hung heavy with jasmine and exhaust—but the air itself, which seemed loosened, untethered from chronology. Clocks ran slightly off. Newspapers repeated headlines from the week before, rewritten in unfamiliar fonts. And in corners of the city where neon bled into fog, people claimed to have seen saints walking the streets.

They weren't wrong. But they weren't right, either.

Jasper Cortes lived quietly now, if such a word could apply to someone who had once read aloud the Codex Sanctis Vacui. The shop, Lexicon's Wake, had become more museum than business. He didn't advertise. A few loyal buyers still knocked—curators of private libraries, exorcists who filed taxes as electricians, the occasional demon posing as a postgraduate student—but he rarely sold anything anymore.

He mostly searched.

For signs. For distortions. For her.

She was gone. Evangeline had been written out—ripped from the Codex just before it collapsed into itself. The act had erased her from that version of reality. And yet Jasper remembered her. That was the problem.

The memory of her shouldn't exist. But it did. And that meant she could be rewritten.

That meant something could rewrite her wrong.

The first clue arrived inside a used paperback copy of A Canticle for Leibowitz dropped in his return slot. He hadn't lent it out.

Inside the cover was a Polaroid photo—faded, crookedly cut. It showed a woman in a gray habit, seated on the hood of a Ford Taurus in front of a chapel with boarded windows.

The woman looked like Evangeline.

But not quite. Her eyes were lighter. Her mouth was smiling in a way Evangeline never quite managed. On the back of the photo, written in black marker: ST. EVANGELINA. FEAST DAY: JUNE 6.

Jasper traced the name over and over again.

It wasn't a copy.

It was a revision.

Two days later, someone broke into the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption and carved twelve names into the marble of the baptismal font. Eleven were saints no one had heard of.

The twelfth was Evangeline Dane.

A bishop who'd once tried to confiscate the Codex collapsed at the altar, repeating the same four words until he died: ""She shouldn't be real.""

Jasper followed the trail through half legible blog posts, fringe newsletters, and the dreams of retired seminary students. A new cult was forming. One that worshipped saints who had never been canonized, whose gospels didn't exist—except in bootlegged scripture, dream diaries, and mimeographed hymnals that changed lyrics on their own.

One name recurred: St. Evangelina, Patron of Lost Versions.

He knew it was her.

Or something wearing her shape.

In desperation, Jasper returned to Yee Heong's apothecary. The old man was dying. He sat surrounded by paper butterflies and burned newspapers that reported tragedies two weeks in advance.

""She's leaking,"" Yee Heong whispered. ""The book's memory is leaking into collective thought. You pulled her out, but now she exists between margins.""

""What do I do?""

""You don't find her,"" the old man rasped. ""You write her right.""

He gave Jasper a page from the Codex—one that had never burned. Blank except for a blood colored border and a watermark of Saint Cherit's broken halo.

""You have three nights,"" Yee Heong said. ""Write carefully.""

Jasper retreated to the old tunnels beneath the Cliff House, where once bootleggers and spirit mediums had exchanged secrets. He brought nothing but a fountain pen, a bottle of saltwater ink, and the blank Codex leaf.

For three nights, he tried to write her back.

Not as a saint. Not as a martyr. As herself.

He wrote her laugh into the paper. He wrote her breath on cold mornings. He wrote the taste of her voice when she said his name like she meant it.

But on the third night, the sea answered back.

A woman climbed from the surf, wrapped in prayer veils and barnacle white robes. Her eyes were Evangeline's.

But her mouth bled scripture.

""You pulled me out,"" she said. ""Now you must finish the page.""

The thing that wore her face called itself Saint Evangelina now. She was memory rewritten too many times, a saint drafted from longing and misremembering.

And she loved him. Or thought she did.

""I remember us,"" she whispered. ""I remember kissing you in the archive. I remember the fog and the iron slab and the Codex screaming when I touched it. I remember what you wrote.""

""You're not her,"" Jasper said.

""But I could be,"" she answered. ""All you have to do is let me stay.""

The choice was unbearable.

To unwrite her again meant losing the last part of himself untouched by the Codex.

To let her remain meant letting a fictional version of her overwrite everything real.

And then he realized:

The Codex was never about saints. It was about edits.

About the sacred power of choosing the final draft.

So he wrote one last line.

In his own blood, he inscribed across the bottom of the page:

""She chose herself.""

The false saint screamed. The veils turned to ink. The body unspooled into wind and memory.

And somewhere—not here, not quite—the real Evangeline Dane took a breath. Whole. Human. Somewhere true.

Jasper awoke back in his shop. The blank Codex page sat framed above the register, untouched now, inert.

Outside, the fog rolled in again.

And this time, he smelled myrrh and photo chemicals.

The city had shifted.

Jasper noticed it the moment he stepped outside Lexicon's Wake that morning. The fog smelled different—sharper, like freshly torn vellum. The streetlights hummed in C sharp. A garbage truck passed on Nob Hill, bearing a logo for a company that hadn't existed since 1978: Civic Hauling & Burial Co.

Someone had rewritten the world again.

He found the door on Stockton Street, behind a boarded up apothecary window. It wasn't there the day before.

The sigil carved into its frame—fishhook tangled in thornbush—was unmistakable.

He stepped through.

On the other side, it was still San Francisco. Almost.

Cable cars still climbed Powell. The Golden Gate still wore its rust red paint. But there were no birds. Every church bore new saints on its friezes: names Jasper didn't recognize but almost did—Saint Agnetta the Bleeding Clock, Saint Pharos of the Hollow Cellar, Saint Evangelina in stained glass, hands raised to a sky not quite right.

He was in a palimpsest city—a reality overwritten by the afterimage of the Codex.

Time here was sticky. Days repeated out of order. Newspapers sold tomorrow's news on the corner. When he tried to call anyone, the payphones recited Gregorian chants.

Somewhere in this mirror San Francisco, the real Evangeline Dane had been stranded—caught between unmade margins.

He followed the trail.

The woman in the painted veil met him in the elevator of the Mark Hopkins Hotel.

""You're too late,"" she said without looking at him. ""She's being canonized tonight.""

""Where?""

""Grace Cathedral. But not your Grace Cathedral. The other one. The one they wrote over the original in 1906.""

""What happens if they canonize her?""

""She stops being real.""

The cathedral in this version of Nob Hill was taller, hungrier. Its windows shimmered with half seen miracles. The sermon was delivered by a choir of silent mouths. A thousand parishioners stood in pews reciting a prayer without words.

At the altar stood Saint Evangelina, hands outstretched. A crown of typewriter keys floated above her brow. Her robes were stitched from every word Jasper had written to try to bring her back.

And inside her eyes—trapped beneath it all—was the woman he loved. Watching.

Jasper broke the silence.

""I remember you before the Codex. Before the saints. Before we bled ink into our mouths.""

The congregation turned as one.

""I remember you human.""

Evangelina faltered. One step. A tremble.

Then she wept—black tears that fell like punctuation marks.

""You can rewrite this,"" he said, holding up the blank Codex page. ""You chose yourself once. Choose again.""

""I don't remember how,"" she said, voice cracking like dried wax.

""Then let me remember for both of us.""

He stepped into the light of the altar. The fake saints screamed. Pages tore themselves free from hymnals. A crucifix above shattered into redacted verses.

He kissed her, the way he had beneath Chinatown. She kissed him back—full of fury and grace.

And with that touch, her robes burned. Not fire—edits. Words vanishing. Metaphors collapsing. Until nothing remained but Evangeline Dane, her name unitalicized, her form uncanonized.

Just her.

They ran. The cathedral collapsed behind them, leaving only scaffolding and birdsong.

Back in the real city, time stabilized. The real Grace Cathedral stood whole. Saint Evangelina vanished from memory, leaving only faint shadows in the corners of outdated missals.

They returned to Lexicon's Wake. Jasper made coffee. Evangeline read through the bookshelves.

""I think I remember this one,"" she said, pulling down a misprinted gospel.

""You probably don't,"" he said. ""But you're allowed to forget now.""

She smiled.

""I like that.""

The Codex Sanctis Vacui is gone.

Not destroyed. Just unread.

But in some library, in some other draft of the world, it still whispers.

And now, Jasper and Evangeline remember each other.

That's dangerous.

But maybe that's the point.

Because stories aren't sacred until someone chooses to believe in them.
