1kt6whm,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1kt6whm/my_bogotá_story/,My bogotá story,"Finally pulling the trigger on sharing this even though it still feels a bit surreal. Been lurking forever and honestly the sheer volume of cope back home made me need a change of scenery.

I'm an operations lead early 40s for a private firm based in the US but contracted directly by the US Embassy in Bogotá. We handle a lot  of specialized project management and logistical support for various initiatives. Been on the road for months bouncing around some less-than-glamorous locales. Had a rotation come up in Bogotá mostly data assessment and some liaison stuff. Figured it was a good excuse to escape the dating scene back in the States – the endless swiping the power dynamics feeling like you're in a job interview just to get a coffee. My fuse was definitely short.

Wasn't looking for anything serious just a break a change of pace. About three weeks in after a particularly grueling stretch of briefings I decided to blow off some steam. Ended up downtown near the old city trying to find a decent no-frills local spot for a late dinner. My driver dropped me off a few blocks too early and I was a little turned around. That's when I saw her let's call her Sofía. She was standing outside a small unassuming salsa bar looking a bit weathered but when our eyes met she gave this soft genuinely warm smile. Not a hint of the usual transactional BS you see everywhere.

Asked her if she knew a good place for some authentic Colombian food something away from the tourist traps. We got to talking. She was incredibly open about her life – working hard sending money back to her family up north. No pretense no games just a raw unvarnished honesty that felt like a breath of fresh air. We just clicked talked for hours. She actually listened which was a novel concept.

The next day I had a series of high-stakes meetings even a formal dinner with some embassy folks. Showing up alone felt like a weakness and let's be real having a gracious sharp local by your side can cut through a lot of red tape and awkward silences. Sofía was smart naturally poised and no denying it stunning. I tracked her down and put it to her straight: I needed her company for the week as a local guide and my plus-one for these events. I offered her a significant advance – enough to cover her usual income and then some so she could just relax and enjoy the experience. Bros the look of disbelief then pure gratitude in her eyes… she practically teared up. Said no one had ever just offered to help her like that no hidden agendas beyond what was agreed.

My hotel was one of those secure high-rise types and the first time Sofía walked in with me I noticed a few of the staff giving her a subtle side-eye. Pissed me off instantly. I made it a point to treat her like absolute royalty – opening doors making sure she was always comfortable and gave a few pointed looks and a quiet word to the manager. They got the message real quick when they saw she was with my delegation.

Sofía wasn't exactly sporting designer threads – mostly practical well-worn clothes. So the next morning I told her ""We're hitting the shops."" We went to one of the upscale malls Andino. She was shy at first checking price tags whispering that everything was too much. I just told her ""Pick what makes you feel fantastic. Don't look at the cost that's on me."" It was incredible watching her transform seeing her genuinely light up and enjoy being treated. Some of the boutique staff were a little sniffy initially until they saw my government-issued card come out. Sofía handled it all with such quiet dignity. It wasn't about the labels for her it was about feeling beautiful respected and indulged for once. And damn she looked absolutely radiant.

Over that week I took her everywhere. High-level project briefings (where she quietly observed and picked up on everything) exclusive rooftop bars overlooking the city even a traditional Cumbia show she'd only ever heard about. She was a natural. A little reserved at first in those formal settings but she's sharp a keen observer picked up social cues like a pro. I'd give her little pointers and she was so receptive so eager to learn. We had these long conversations about her family her dreams my jaded ops life. One evening I was just idly messing around on the piano in the hotel's executive lounge late at night and she just sat there listening with this soft almost reverent look on her face. It was… real. Not the constant vetting and ""what's in it for me"" vibe I was so sick of.

As the week wound down it hit me how much I genuinely valued her company. She was sharp funny in her own quiet way deeply kind – everything I'd basically given up on finding. I told her ""Sofía this has been incredible. I don't want this to just be a memory. I can set you up in a great apartment here in Bogotá make sure you're taken care of so you don't have to struggle. We can build something from this."" Pure provider mode laying it all out. She got quiet very quiet. Thanked me profusely said it had been the most amazing week of her life a true fairy tale. But then she said she needed to think about her own future that she had ambitions of saving up to open a small flower stall in her family's village to be near them and be her own boss. That she didn't just want to be dependent as much as she appreciated my offer and what I'd done. Honestly I was stunned. Not the answer I expected. Part of me admired that independent spirit that traditional resilience but another part was like ""Why choose the hard road when I'm offering you comfort?"" She was so sweet and respectful about it though no drama.

So the week ended. She carefully packed her new clothes and the gifts and we said our goodbyes. No histrionics just a lot of genuine emotion. After she left my secure impersonal suite felt ridiculously empty. All the ""important"" project deliverables suddenly seemed trivial. This woman with her quiet strength and untainted heart had gotten under my skin. This wasn't just some ""arrangement"" anymore not by a long shot.

I found out from a friendly hotel staffer (one Sofía had charmed with her kindness) that she was heading to the Salitre bus terminal that very afternoon to go back to her province. Something just snapped in me. This wasn't some fling. This was... different. I grabbed the biggest most ridiculously over-the-top bouquet of Andean lilies from the hotel florist jumped in a black cab and raced over there like a madman. Found her just as she was about to step onto this old dusty bus looking small and a bit lost again. I literally ran up the steps heart hammering.

I just looked at her and said ""Sofía don't go. Or if you have to go let me come with you. Let me meet your family see your village. What we have this connection it's real. I was an idiot to think of it any other way or that it could just be a week. Let's try this for real.""
Bros the way her face just… transformed. That smile that genuine unfiltered happiness – it's the kind of look you just don't see anymore back home that pure joy that money can't buy but genuine care can unlock. She said yes.
So yeah. It's still new. We're taking it day by day. I went with her to her village met her family

It's a whole different universe but it's real. I guess my point is sometimes you find the most precious things when you're not even looking and in the places the mainstream tells you to avoid. You just gotta be open treat people with genuine respect and kindness and sometimes yeah be willing to be that ""knight in shining armor"" when you find a woman who truly deserves it and appreciates a good man.
Feeling pretty damn optimistic about the future for the first time in what feels like an eternity. Maybe there's hope for us old-school romantics yet eh? Just had to share. Worth the flight a thousand times over.

We also have 5 more days to fill after we check out of Le Monastere and are trying to decide where to go/what to do for days 6-10. We can hire a car and have been considering the Eastern Townships.

So I tried my first batching using unflavored protein powder and used a stevia/monk fruit sweetener. I don't think I'd change anything. 

Mint Chocolate Chip 

12 oz lactose-free half & half
1 1/2 scoops unflavored Isopure protein powder
1 tsp pure vanilla extract 
1 1/2 tsp mint extract
2 ""squirts"" liquid stevia/monkfruit sweetener (or to desired sweetness)

Warm up half & half for 30 secs in microwave. Add protein powder. Mix with a frother. Add remaining ingredients and mix well. Pour into Creami container. Freeze uncovered for at least 24hrs. Thaw for 10 min. Use ice cream mode. Add a little half/half and re-spin if too dry. I mixed in chopped up 72% cacao Ghirardelli dark chocolate 

I'm trying another batch using instant decaf coffee instead of mint extract.

Since I hit puberty, I’ve been dreaming a lot — things you might consider silly or small, like going out for coffee, seeing my friends, wearing what I want. And when I say “wear what I want,” I don’t mean a bikini — I mean dresses, and other normal things.

Sitting alone in my room, having privacy without someone intruding.
Trying to love without fear.

Everything I did, I did it with fear. The environment around me was toxic.
The women were oppressed, convincing themselves this is for the best — that they’re content — but they’re dying inside, wishing for a million things.

What makes me different is that I have a free spirit.
I fought until I finally got out.

The furthest freedom I had was our backyard.
I’d go out maybe once a month — and never alone — always with my family.
I used to try creating a special vibe for myself, but it always ended in conflict and fights.
And my hatred for them grew every single day.

Now, I’m far away from them. And thank God for this life.
But I still want to completely cut them out of my life.

Yes — this is the reality for most Arab women.
Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.
What you see on social media is only the life of 5% of women.

Wish me full freedom — and the chance to live without fear.",2,1747961565.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,0,1.0,False

one of his main issues with me and why he wanted to break up is he said that i never put as much effort or thought into “little gestures for him”. for example, he would cook for me, massage me, send me money for coffees, pick me flowers. he was all around the perfect partner. i couldn’t have asked for more.
throughout our 7 month relationship i would ask if he felt his needs were being met, and he always said of course! so i figured everything was fine. but upon breakup this complaint was added to a laundry list of others i need to fix. 
i was trying to show him love with my own little gestures. i think we all love differently. i would write him letters, make him playlists, do sexual favors and not want it reciprocated, get him flowers, make him breakfast, doordash lunch to him, stand by him and love him while he’s sick in bed. he always told me i was doing everything right. and how much he was grateful to have me. i really thought i was doing everything i could. i thought i was doing the right thing by him. so my question is, what are little gestures that men loved that make them feel extra loved? when and if we find our way back together i want to make sure im meeting his needs. thank you in advance. this has been really hard on me so please be kind.

Long story short, I’ve known my best friend for about 10 years at this point. We did a smaller trip a few years ago that went relatively well. No huge issues. We also no longer live in the same country, and my country’s dollar is significantly weaker. 

In April, she sprung on me that we should do a trip abroad this year. Ok, sure! 

But we HAVE to do it in May because she starts a job in the beginning of June. Less ok. I’ve been in school the past 6 years with very little income coming in because I haven’t been able to work. She has been working though and has a savings built up. 

I tell her that’s not really feasible, she tells me “ok well I’m gonna go either way.” This very manipulative, and like it was less about US going on this trip together, and more about her doing what she wants and me tagging along. 

Should’ve clocked that red flag. She flies out early and explores another country, then I meet her there and we fly to France. 

Right off the bat, we’re spending wayyyyyyyy too much money on food. I’m all for experiencing food culture and new things, but every single place is €20+, not including drinks or water (they charged out the ass for that). We’re in the country that invented cafes, and presumably a normal breakfast would be a pastry and a coffee. So why were we having a sit down breakfast every day? Her argument? Our vacation is so short, it only makes sense on longer vacations to buy food to make at home/cheap meals. I guess 9 days is short and 27 meals isn’t that many. 

The day I tried to put my foot down was when we went to a beach club/restaurant, and I covered the bill. What was €178, was actually nearly $300 in my currency. I was fuming. (She also ordered something I’m allergic to and could not eat so why was I paying for something that would kill me.)

We got into a fight and decided to start splitting the bills. It got slightly better. I put my foot down when we went back to the beach bar and she once again ordered the platter I’m allergic to, and it was put on her bill. She seemed a bit bitter about that but I didn’t care.

Everywhere we went was somewhere she HAD to try. She told me we could split up if I wanted (the tone was very condescending) and obviously in a foreign country, I’m not keen to do that. I told her I’d rather experience the tourism stuff and buy souvenirs/clothes. She said the food was important to her and she wants all of that. 

This meant I really had no option. So while we’re out shopping for things, I’m barely looking at anything. I have barely any souvenirs. I kept making comments about how low my credit balance was becoming. I can’t even express how upset I am about how I spent so much money on food I didn’t even LIKE (like a stupid 7 course tasting meal where every course was awful and focused on the weird elements of the food. like the sourness of rhubarb for ice cream. WHY)

If you know anything by about Europe, I feel like crying in public is a huge nono. But today I lost it while I was texting my mom, I couldn’t stop them from falling because I can’t believe I’d have my “best” friend gives so little of a shit about my needs or perspective. We saved the shopping until the end, meaning I had no money to buy anything. 

I’m bringing home tea, salt, and 2 sticks of butter. Those are my only souvenirs. She made no comment when I said I couldn’t afford the clothes we were shopping for. She told me getting mcdonald’s in a foreign country was dumb, even though that would’ve been cheaper for me. Or even a fucking croissant and a coffee for breakfast. We’ve gone to no bakeries, and only finally went to a creperie yesterday. Staple foods in france and my absolute favorite french foods. There was 0 effort to accommodate my financial situation. She looked me dead in the eye, after I said I’m almost out of money, and asked if I’d get the next uber. 

Just to add insult to injury, we didn’t actually go in to any of the sight seeing places that I specifically wanted to see because “the lines were too long.” Mind you, I’ve been sick since day one, pretty sure I broke my toe on the pebble beach, and I’ve had no appetite. And we got food poisoning from the famous steak frites place she took us to last night, that was also €40. And yet I have rallied for ever. single. thing. that she wanted to do. I even helped her get that shit achieved. 

Sorry for the long rant, I just needed to get it out. I’m so unbelievably upset with her. She’s know me for ten years, knows I’m soft spoken and won’t put up much of a fight. She’s the one who’s supposed to advocate for me and see my perspective. And instead she used it against me to her advantage. I have no idea how to address this with her. But I will never travel with her again. Not when this is the example she set. ",2,1747961032.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.75,False

He was downstairs in front of his apt building waiting for a food delivery on 29th st near 30th ave. 2 men came out of a vehicle to ask for directions to the hospital. They inched closer to him because 'they could not hear him'.
He also approached slowly and they thanked him by shaking his hand and giving him some jewelry. They left as as soon as they got the directions.
He was a bit baffled by the handshake. The food came and went upstairs. When he went upstairs he saw that his gold bracelet was stolen. Was o his left hand.
That was real gold.
He was shocked that it happened, let alone how it happened. I told him thieves like know what they are doing. Distract and steal.
He wasn't too upset about it and I was happy they wasnt any violence involved and didn't do anything else!

1kt6grg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kt6grg,Silvia w/ PID Missing Thermostat,"So I bought this used V5 w/ Auber PID installed a little over a year ago. The original owner purchased it with the PID pre installed from Seattle Coffee Gear back in 2017.

Ever since I’ve had it, I’ve noticed if I left the steam function on, it would get to the point to where it would flip the safety thermostat (165 C). To prevent that I’ve just always been watching the PID and steaming before it got to this temp. 

Finally decided to fix it, and after a bit of research assumed the T2 steam thermostat for 140 C must have gone bad. Ordered a new thermostat, went to open the machine up, and am now realizing it looks like there is a whole thermostat missing (see pictures where white circle is). The guide from SCG states that the PID does not control the steam temp and that steam is controlled the same as the machine does stock. 

Just looking for confirmation on that this seems to be true from someone who has more experience working inside a Silvia. Is there any reason this thermostat would be removed?",1,1747960346.0,ranciliosilvia,0,1.0,False

1kt6g5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/underworld/comments/1kt6g5y/glowing_and_reeling_after_seattle_show/,Glowing and Reeling after Seattle Show,"UNDERWORLD! Magic. Love. Light. Joy. Dance. 

I was fortunate enough to see them back in 2007 at Central Park in New York for my first time. I have loved and resonated with Underworld for over 20 years now. I believe that their music and lyrics are like a reflection of being a human in a certain time and space on this planet. I was so excited they were coming to Seattle and managed to get tickets early on back in February. Life got pretty crazy in the last few months, and so my excitement for the show had waned into the background as I dealt with the cards. 

I've been working straight without a day off for three weeks now, and the show was falling right into the final week of this exhausting stretch. I didn't know if I was going to be able to rally, but I got myself down to Seattle and while walking towards the venue, ran into someone else who kept eyeing me in my neon button up shirt and glitter studded cheeks. He finally asked, ""are you going to the Underworld show?"" and my friend and I replied YES. The three of us walked the remaining blocks to Showbox SoDo together, telling tales of our love of Underworld and past shows. That little connection lit up my excitement. My tired brain finally realized: holy SHIT we are about to see Underworld. We laughed as he explained he'd spent the day in the city hoping to run into them somewhere...wouldn't that be rad? I could imagine Karl tucking away in a small coffee shop and writing the afternoon away. 

Walking in was a surreal experience. I haven't been so a small venue show in so long. All of these memories came rushing back from going to raves in Seattle around 2000. We loitered around, and finally settled into a spot nearish the front. I had no idea what to expect from this show. I had been absolutely delighted to see the Showbox listing the evening as ""Underworld: open to close"" meaning no openers. Pure evening of UW. Finally the lights adjusted and they took the stage. I just couldn't really believe it at first. I was so tired, my brain was so groggy, and it just took a moment to really believe it was happening and there they were!! The music was immediately so good, and washed over me. I started trying to dance, and this is the ONE dang thing I will say about that evening that felt a little bummer: it took a long while for the crowd to really warm up and feel comfortable moving. I was trying my best to dance, but was pretty packed in between a lot of folks just standing. A few songs into the first set, after they had nearly disappeared from view behind all of the fog machines and lights...I realized that this is a fricken dance party. This isn't a traditional concert where I am feeling the need to be close and see the performance. This was bringing me back, again, to the raver days of dancing and dancing and dancing. So, when the unexpected intermission started, I made a decision to get myself all the way to the back of the crowd to be out of people's way, and DANCE. They came back and I let it all go. I went wild. I was absorbed into the music. All the while trying not to be a total asshole and watching my arms and my space, but being in the back definitely gave me more room to move. All the while getting dripped on by the dang HVAC metal duct pipe above me!!! Once I let go of trying to be up front, of being in the tight crowd, I just relaxed. It all came back. I couldn't believe the songs they played. I didn't know if it would be Strawberry heavy or a mix of things. Completely emotional that Low Burn got a moment. Cried when Dark Train rolled in. Didn't even think I had anything LEFT and then Moaner began and this wild wind rushed through me and I danced even harder. The yellow hued lighting during Two Months Off and then during Born Slippy was so fucking beautiful the way it silhouetted everybody's palms raised up. The power of hearing their music on a big sound system (I know Showbox SoDo doesn't have the best rep for a good sound system and I generally agree, but damn after listening to so much music on fucking earbuds these days...), LOUD but balanced, getting rattled by the deep bass....fucking therapy!!!

At one point, this wonderful human was near me, maybe they were walking past with a partner? But she just EMBRACED me suddenly and we danced, laughed, jumped, and spun around a full 360 in this amazing hug and god damn that made the night!! Thank you kind soul. I hope your evening was as magical as you made me feel!!!

I was elated to be near a few other folks letting it OUT and really dancing hard. It feels good to be in that energy again after so many years away from raving. 

Underworld is such a gift. They express life in a way that I am so drawn to: humanity is flawed and beautiful and complicated and lovely and silly and energetic and wild. I like the way they see the world and I love and treasure the music they make. Thanks everyone who came out and made that evening magic, it felt good to celebrate those guys. Lots of love to all. Let's hope they make another live album from this tour!!!",8,1747960293.0,underworld,1,1.0,False

1kt6fa5,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1kt6fa5/stopped_trying_to_decode_women_what_i_learned/,"Stopped trying to ""decode"" women - what I learned after 10+ years","This happened again last week and got me thinking about how much my approach has changed over the years.

Met this woman at a coffee shop downtown. Great conversation, lots of laughing, she even gave me her number without me asking. Seemed like a clear green light.

Texted her that evening with something casual about our conversation. Then... radio silence for three days. Eventually got a brief ""sorry, been swamped with work"" response.

Five years ago, this would have sent me into analysis mode for hours. What did I say wrong? Was my timing off? Should I have waited longer to text?

I used to approach dating like it was a puzzle to solve. Spent way too much time reading pickup theory, analyzing every interaction, looking for the ""perfect"" approach that would work consistently.

After thousands of conversations and interactions over the past decade, I've learned something counterintuitive: the inconsistency isn't a bug, it's a feature.

Here's what I mean. I started noticing clear patterns once I had enough real-world experience:

Women respond based on their current emotional state as much as anything you do. If she's having a great day, almost anything lands well. If she's stressed about deadlines or dealing with family drama, even your best material falls flat.

The same woman who doesn't respond to a thoughtful message one day might engage enthusiastically with a random comment another day. Context matters more than content most of the time.

Words carry less weight than the energy behind the conversation. There's something intangible that happens when two people click - the actual topics become almost irrelevant.

Sometimes you'll feel this electric tension where even mundane small talk feels charged. Other times, perfect conditions and great conversation still don't lead anywhere.

I still don't get it right every time. But the difference now is that I don't lose sleep over it.

Dating makes more sense when you stop expecting logical consistency from something that's fundamentally emotional and situational.

The breakthrough for me wasn't finding better techniques or understanding women better. It was accepting that success in dating is more about volume and genuine connection than perfect execution.

If you're stuck in the analysis paralysis phase right now, I get it. That frustration when you think you're doing everything right but results feel random.

My advice? Stop trying to crack the code and start collecting more real experience. The patterns become visible after hundreds of interactions, not dozens. And the confidence that comes from that experience changes how you show up in ways that matter more than any specific thing you say.",11,1747960222.0,self,11,0.79,False

Do not move too quickly

Drawing attention is not an option

Tip toe down the hallway

Heart racing 

The door is always closed behind

Kettle on

Always loud

Gently lift the cup and place it down slowly

Scoop the coffee 

The spoon chimes against the cup

Damnit… 

Freeze for a moment and listen

No one is coming

Coffee in hand and sneaking back down the hall

It is close now

Turn the corner

There is safety at last

I was interviewed by the head of HR and the woman who would be my boss. The interview was originally scheduled for 45 minutes, but we ended up chatting for an hour and a half. They mentioned some concerns, such as that they were worried I'd be bored, given my current role is in research, but I informed them I've worked similar roles in corporate settings before. At the end, they informed me they were only doing one round of interviews and that they would make a decision within a week.

  
Fast forward to last Friday, I received a call at 4:30. The head of HR updated me, saying they'd actually decided to make a decision this week, on Wednesday. Fast forward again, and I get another call from the same person saying, actually, they'd like me to come in in a few days (today) for coffee with the woman who would be my boss. They said it was to ""chat"" and make sure I fully understand the role, and so that I can learn more about the company.

  
What should I expect? I've never had a deadline moved (twice) on me, and have never been asked to come in again after formal interviews are done. I'm assuming it's a good sign, given they're still speaking with me, but I don't know how to prepare for this.

Day 4 the top layer had little green dots of mold. I removed and the other layers were fine. There was no molding on the liquid it's self just the paper. Didn't take a picture.

I removed the filters and replaced them with new ones that I cover with vinegar. And clean the area with vinegar to prevent more molding. I did add vinegar to it to top off. Learned I wasn't supposed to do that. However it seemed to still ferment and bubbles are forming since pressure is being created when I fully close the lead for a few hours. 

I'm think of letting it roll but also feel like I made mistake that could potentially make me sick. If I could get some input that would be great.",1,1747959862.0,fermentation,0,1.0,False

1kt6a7l,https://i.redd.it/d21rsluudf2f1.jpeg,Finding Grace,"Not really remembering anything from before! Before! A dark raven haired Latina! brown eyed girl named Jenna’ had awaken into a world in which she would find herself. Finding herself now living in a world now where she see meets people that have since passed. But from within her new world that she now lives in, with her along the way riding her bike discovering new trails that would show her a life that was once hers. 

From waking up to looking out her window into a world that was still very new to her! While still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. With anticipation of what was about to be! Jenna’ a very outgoing dark haired girl! That very much knew how to handle things. While at the same time letting some people in her life. As Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

A girl that wasn’t afraid to express herself! While at the same time excepting a challenge! From anyone that wanted to race her! With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others! Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some! Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her! 

But as Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself!
Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna’ was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna’

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her! The surroundings! The people! Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here! That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday! Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her! Racing was her excitement! And it showed! With her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her! For her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’! With his dark hair brown eyes! And a smile For Jenna’! But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was! Never backing down from a challenge, finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye! But! From time to time! His name was Hector! Hector’ Was a guy that charm on a dime. A Latino Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her!

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something! 

But with each new day bringing something new to her! A new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever! Dodging in and out of traffic! But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail! Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts! Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts! It was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop! That was owned by Hector’s father! Also named Hector! She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general! With one! Being of his son Hector’ for Jenna” very much had a crush on him! Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector’ but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in! As he often would! Setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ or at least his friends would call him that! Often finding himself telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city! A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

For Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger.

Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where I wanted to be buried.

That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen! That in the end that this was his home! This was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. 

Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was! Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light.

Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area! Standing there thinking if any of these people could be who they are! Could they be of someone else from somewhere else!

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life! Being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her! Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead.

But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race.

Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now! But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! A calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to himself

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side! riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. She was riding into Life! into her 

Life Living a Life of what she made it. For that day! Jenna’ had found Grace!

1kt692g,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1kt692g/i_finally_need_to_answer_her_call_and_i_need_a/,I finally need to answer her call and I need a push so I can be free!,"I (45f) have known for a long time that my mother, when I was 14/15 years old and had my first boyfriend (17/18 at the time), had a sexual relationship with that guy, and that this loser even lived with her for a short time years later. 

I got this information from an acquaintance from my youth, whom I lost touch with and met again in my late 20s: he mentioned my then-boyfriend and talked about how absolutely disgusting he found that he had become intimate with my mother. 

(I truly believe that: i remember her once lifting her shirt, scratching her tummy so he could see her tits. And I remember me learning for school while them drinking beer in the kitchen and hearing them talking about how difficult I was - she complained about me being a bad daughter, he complained about me being a bad girlfriend. Yeah, I was 14. He lived with us, no job, mother no job, only I went out every day for school. I loved going to school as I did good and my teachers valued my performance)

Wtf?!! At that time, I was ashamed of my mother and also felt sorry for her. I didn’t realize how pathetic and despicable that was of my mother. I actually just pitied her. And I was so ashamed for her! I said back then that I couldn’t confront her about it because... well, because I just couldn’t? I was so ashamed of her! I also knew that a conversation about it would lead nowhere. So I swallowed it, looked past it, and pushed it aside. For so many years. 


The second piece of information came from her neighbor, about 2 years earlier: because my mother is a lazy fuck, she never worked while I was in school because she received enough social assistance that way.

After I graduated at 19 and moved out for university, the job office wanted her to work, and eventually, she had to take a job. It was a seasonal position in a winter tourist resort. Her house is old, and without regular heating, all the pipes would freeze, so her neighbor and I took turns: every few days, I would drive over and heat the place, or the disabled(!) neighbor would hobble over. Of course, I also visited the neighbor during my heating sessions and had coffee with her. During these visits, I heard that I was ""such a sweet girl"" and that the neighbor didn’t know what my mother had against me - WTF! So she must have complained to the neighbor about what a bad child I was!

And also: that it was good that she finally ""wasn’t letting that Max in anymore because he just used her, he was so much younger, he just mooched off her.""


This Max was my ex-boyfriend. Previously only suspected, I am sure after my acquaintance's information. This loser also met that disgusting old woman later! 


The connection only came to my mind later. I knew what my aquitance said, I knew what the neigbour said.


And again, after adding one and one together, I felt ashamed for her, and I felt sorry for her! Instead of being angry with her, I felt sorry for her, and I was ashamed for her! 



I have been carrying this knowledge around for over 15 years. I broke off contact for a while because every interaction with this woman either left me without energy for days or with guilt.

My aunt (her sister) kept trying to get me to let myself be lulled in. I endured visiting her, talking to her on the phone. Greyrocking worked for a short time, but in the long run, you betray yourself with it: she knows no boundaries and uses indifference to trample on your limits. After every visit, every phone call, I felt abused.

Then, on my last birthday: I was on my way to my favorite country (Italia mi amore!) to have a good time. My mother called and congratulated me in a way that made me feel guilty - or should feel guilty. At that point, I saw through the mechanism perfectly, and yet she managed to make me question what I had done wrong during those few days at the sea. Even though I saw through her game. No, she didn’t ruin my vacation completely - but she managed to make me annoyed and ponder again and again.

I blocked her after my vacation. She then called even more often. (I could see the blocked calls.) So I unblocked her again and didn’t pick up. On Christmas, I picked up and said that my phone was broken and that I rarely have reception at home. 

Her birthday was three months later. I called to congratulate her. No, I have too much to do, working two jobs, don't have time to visit her.

She then threatens to visit me (wtf, she doesn't even know my exact adress! Oh yeah, it's more than 15 years I live here, she never minded) - I say, yeah, we’ll see, I work a lot and have little time. 

And then I had the saving thought: I’ll bring up Max! 

I’LL BRING IT UP! 

I don’t expect an apology from this woman, no regret, nothing at all! I just want my peace.

I see no reason why I should be ashamed of her: she should be ashamed of herself! And no, I don’t feel sorry for her; she should feel sorry for herself! And she should feel sorry about betraying her own daughter in the most disgusting way! 

I am completely aware that she will try to avoid this confrontation. She will distract, not remember, downplay everything, act pitiful, and in the end, I should feel guilty for pointing out her own misbehavior because she is so poor. 

If it even comes to that. Maybe she will just hang up (most likely!) And then she won’t contact me again - that’s my goal.

I've been working as a barista in a chain coffee shop for half a year now. the coffees we serve are all made according to our company's manuals. so a cappuccino (medium size) would be a double espresso with milk that has been steamed till it gets to 30°c and then warmed up to 60°c. it then should be completely white (no latte art) with a thick 3-4cm foam on top and a ring. this is all I know according to my company's standards, but I've seen cappuccino being described as completely different coffees and no one has given one simple correct answer. when I go to other cafes and order cappuccino, most of the time I get a latte art on top of it. shouldn't latte art ONLY be present on lattes????? also what is a ""real"" cappuccino in that case ???????? please help me I feel stupid",4,1747959586.0,barista,9,1.0,False

1kt64gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kt64gv/advice_pls_done_lots_of_research_just_a_couple/,"Advice pls. Done lots of research, just a couple questions: Profitec Go, Lelit Victoria [AUD$2000]","I am replacing an old and almost dead Sunbeam in which I've been using pre ground coffee. I only do one drink at a time, once or twice daily, and I steam milk. I'm in Australia.

Requirements: I've decided I want a PID (factory as I can't bothered modding to add one), pressure gauge, and 58mm portafilter. Small footprint. Other family members don't drink coffee but would like the machine to be quiet!

Based on this I'm looking at Lelit Victoria and Profitec Go. Dual boiler would be too much money, not justified for my use, and probably too big.

Unfortunately I can't find either machine to look at in person locally.

I gather from many reviews that both are built well, the Go maybe slightly better. Both can make good espresso. The Go's lower cup clearance is unfortunate, so I would probably want a bottomless PF. I think both machines can be noisy but can be improved by adding sililcone bumpers.

My questions:

1. Lots of reddit posts say the Go is bad at steaming. But I've seen it work well in video reviews. I'm aware of the 5 sec purge, wait 10 sec, purge again. People say steaming is tricky to learn on the Go, maybe due to the 2 hole tip, which I'm happy to change out. I am not interested in latte art, just want nice coffee. What's the deal? Is the Go any harder to steam on than any other single boiler, like the Victoria? Does the Victoria need the purge routine as well? My only experience is with the (thermoblock) Sunbeam.
2. The Victoria auto-fills the boiler I think. One shop told me the Profitec Go needs you to switch back to coffee after steaming to fill the boiler again. If you don't, the boiler may run dry and cause damage not covered by warranty. Is this correct?

But until then-(grande),"It's a long shot ;), but here are some prompt ideas to include in your weekly partner survey. You can also replace my complex drink example with one of the complex ones you made on your most recent shift.


1. Hello, thank you for asking how to improve the partner experience. Many partners are working paycheck-to-paycheck (even at full-time) with the rising costs of living, and I believe employee turnover wouldn’t be the issue that it is at most locations with sustainable pay.
2. Another reason I think partner-retention is decreasing is the inaccessibility of the job itself. The ""return to coffeehouse"" model is neglecting the coffee itself. Elaborate, 6-16 modification drinks (iced matcha with two different types of cold foams, three different syrups, in a different-sized cup, with 4 splendas, and a two trenta iced cups on the side) are contributing to a feeling of disrespect for both the serving baristas and waiting customers.
3. Limiting modifications to a reasonable 4 would perhaps improve the drivethru and waiting times we as baristas hear about several times every shift. It would also bring back, I believe, a feeling of enjoyment to the job again. The announcement that the menu was being reduced excited a lot of partners, but that excitement fizzled when it was drinks like the Java chip Frappuccino, a popular and simpler drink compared to one like the mocha cookie crumble or the mermaid matcha, for instance.
4. I am hopeful that future launches will focus on coffee-based beverages instead of introducing myriads of new ingredients, training, modification options, and drinks that impact the workload so heavily.
5. Many of the partners, as confessed by thousands on online forums, share a sentiment that the company cares far more about its profit than its people. I agree, and I love my team. For months, similar feedback has been shared to surveys like this one (which state that the reason for the survey is to improve the partner experience), but the feedback feels neglected so far.
6. Radical menu reductions, a substantial pay increase, more freedom over how many orders can be placed per minute (or greater control over filtering the several ordering channels), modification limitations or less strict drive times, more partner self-expression (one of our strongest co-workers forced to leave for having more than one piercing), and corporate being upfront and transparent that they indeed are NOT neglecting us and keeping us in the loop about future potential changes...these are the changes I would like to see and that I sincerely believe may decrease turnover, increase morale, better the reputation, and save our Starbucks. Thank you.

Comment anymore ideas!! I’ve read some comments that people don’t think corporate even reads this, but in case they do, there is strength in numbers and hopefully some mercy in my attempted politeness.

My father is very strict in that he is always careful that his daughter does not get pregnant out of marriage and is not promiscuous.

Some years ago I worked for a while at a place where I met an excellent older Catholic man who taught me many important life skills. My father and mother approved of him and he was often invited to our house for coffee.

My sister started working at the same place and in defiance to my father and mother she would go out wearing one thing and then change to look like a slut. She'd go to work like that and she started getting a reputation as 'easy' etc.

My friend once took it upon himself to privately give her a pamphlet explaining the virtues of being modest and not provocative at work. What did he get? She reported him to human resources for sexual harassment. He got called to HR and as a punishment was transferred to a very distant place away from his home and family.

Both my father and I begged my sister to take back her accusations because she had ruined a man's life. But           she would smile and say ' why should I? I can do it and I did it!""

2021 Canadian IMP Menu 18, Shakshuka-style Chickpea Stew!!!!

Shout out to Mike Kreischer for the hook up on this unique ration!

Pics 1-3 show packaging and contents

Pic 4 shows the star of the show, the stew! Look at that stew folks, hearty, savory, but, full transparency,  a bit bland to be honest. The aroma  coming off this stew was far more interesting than the flavor. I fixed that issue by adding the entire Tobasco packet and, after realizing that wasn't enough, about half a packet of vegetable bullion from a German EMP! That really helped out.

Some folks may have a hard time with this main, it's not the flavor, rather the texture. I didn't mind it  at all, but I could see how some may find this a bit ""mushy"" for lack of a better word. The absence of meat was negligible here given the heartiness of this main. It was VERY filling for sure.

Pic 5 shows that glorious Canadian IMP BBQ Beef Jerky! I love this stuff! It's terribly difficult to open, but satisfying once the mission is complete. This stuff is very flavorful and definitely has a great chew! 50 grams is no joke either, it's a fair portion.

Pic 6 shows the Tropical Fruit Salad.  A wonderfully sweet mix of various fruits with vibrant colors, textures, and flavors. You all know I love wet pack fruit, and this did not disappoint!

The Vanilla Drink mix was great combined with the Sweet and Creamy coffee packet, a perfect combination!

Kiddo loved the M&Ms and doggo loved the tortillas!

The drink mixes never disappoint, and neither does the PB and Blackberry Jam! That jam is great!

I have no beef with tic tacs, actually a nice change of pace from gum all the time!

Conclusion: Not my favorite main for sure but definitely a great experience trying it. Would enourage others to give this one a shot! Let us all know how you like it when/if you do!

1kt5myh,https://www.reddit.com/r/tjcrew/comments/1kt5myh/should_i_quit/,Should I Quit?,"Hi fellow crew! This is my first post here ever.

Let me give you some back story. I have been working for the company for 3 years now, I started when I was 18! Though, after my first year working there I have been dealing with a major knee injury , specifically a meniscus tear. I first went through my personal doctor and took some time off. Though, I moved and had to transfer store. I re injured the same knee same injury at this store and this time I went through workers comp which is probably the biggest mistake of my life. They’re so terrible and rude and the doctors suck. I got a second surgery through them and it failed. I am currently injured again and in so much pain but they are refusing to treat me again. There is so much trouble with paper work that they won’t let me get back to work until it is fixed which I have a deadline to fix it. But in order to fix it I need an appointment with the same doctor who denied me and he’s only available 2 times a month ?? Yeah it’s a whole mess.

Anyways, I’m looking for less labor intense jobs in the mean time. I was looking at secretary or desk positions as priority but either a lot of them don’t pay as well or are hard to get. So, i am also heavily considering a barista at starbucks so I can gain barista experience and move into a nicer coffee shop job eventually in the future. Would it be worth it ?!??

Mind you I am also a part time student and full time working.

1kt5mmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1kt5mmh/tifu_by_getting_my_brain_signals_mixed_up_and/,TIFU by getting my brain signals mixed up and staring at someone's chest when they were looking right at me.,"I work as a Barista for a coffee chain and the way our layout works is that the potwash is right next to the serving station, I'm usually on drive through so when there aren't any cars to serve, I'm tasked with keeping up with potwash.

When I'm on potwash, I have to crouch or bend down a bit, so when I come back up, it's not rare to suddenly make eye contact with someone waiting for their order a few centimetres away from me.

The following is my perspective at the time:

So it was hot in the store and outside, lots of people wearing summer clothes like shorts or tank tops, I'm just going about my business with the potwash after I finished serving a customer st the window, I come back up, wipe some sweat off my forehead and see this woman making direct eye contact with me (she briefly glanced at me).

I don't want to accidentally zone out and creepily keep eye contact like I've done a few times so I immediately look down, I noticed the chest, and thought it looked nice.

I would like to note that despite my best efforts, when I see a person, I will usually do a full body scan out of habit,*sometimes*, I glance at the chest or ass but as long as I don't zone out, it's barely noticeable and I'd like to think it's more of a biological habit more than anything else.

However, my mind went into overdrive when I started worrying that I'd creep her out or scare her, so I realised I shouldn't be staring, then I realised this looked worse, then I looked back up, eye contact again, I start panicking and thinking to myself, ""What if she thinks I was staring? What if she feels creeped out? Did I stare or glance? Am I overthinking this? I should look away"".

My plan was to snap back to the potwash after saying a quick and nervous hello to make her not creeped out, instead, my body interpreted it as this:

""Pull your neck down so fast you lift off the ground a bit and almost pull a muscle, look right back at the chest again because it was one of the last things you were thinking about, even if was in a neutral context, maintain obvious line of sight on it for a few seconds until you reboot, berate yourself for staring and overcomplicating this while you remain frozen from shock and shame, finally fully reboot to see that she is actually staring at you now""

I'm pretty sure she was staring at me because I glanced down at her, suddenly whipped my head around 3 times in a second, jumped a little and hit my leg on the door of the potwash.

This whole thing was just my brain wasting action potential on overthinking and my tendancy to space out.

Next time, I'm going to glance up at the ceiling instead.

TL;DR: Got worried about staring like a creep at work, ended up doing a full body jolt to instead stare at someone's chest and just made it worse.",9,1747957827.0,tifu,7,0.85,False

I’m in my 20s, gay, and passionate about theatre/art/music. Big fan of disco. I love cocktails and coffee too! I live in NYC, so I’m totally fine with walking, public transportation, and rowdier areas.

What are the good spots for gay-friendly happy happy drinks? What places give you the best view of the city? Quirky shopping areas? If you could only suggest one coffee shop, what would it be? Spots for free live music? Etc etc. Anything and everything is helpful! Thank you so much!

I still don't know how I feel about him. I reckon I do like him with the amount of time i spend thinking about him, but at the same time it could just be Stockholm syndrome. Tuesday I tweaked the fuck out over him. I think I was just really anxious anyway and the thought of seeing him was too much. It's gotten back to normal now though. There was a pretty uncomfortable conversation today and I could see just how awkward we both got. But in the end things seem to be fine now. I still find myself waiting and wishing he'd show up at my door, knowing full well that would never happen. I am finally back to feeling calm again, so maybe things will finally be okay. It'll be good to talk it out with Soph. I am not excited to have someone in my personal space for 3 nights straight but hopefully we can set some boundaries and be alright. I really have nothing much else to say. I've been spilling all my business to everyone around me so there doesn't seem to be a real need for me to sit and say it to myself. I need to start doing that before I start talking to others though. Putting effort into my drawings is starting to feel good. I finally have the motivation to produce good work because I actually care about the brief. The tutorials are going well I think, and I am finally starting to be on top of things - or at least I will feel on top of things by the mid term crit. Just got to make sure I'm sleeping regularly and not taking ridiculously long naps in the middle of the day. Need to start planning when I drink my coffee and stuff. I hate that I don't like to work at night because this happens to be when I am up. This is the first night I am not completely shattered, however. I reckon I am sorted for now.

Both of us work night shifts in different BPO companies. His shift starts at 8 p.m., mine at 10 p.m., so we don’t leave the house together. He heads out earlier, while I stay behind—usually rushing to get ready while my dad waits outside to drive me to work.

Even if we don’t leave at the same time, he always makes sure I’m okay before he goes. He preps my tumbler, folds my jacket neatly on the chair, and sometimes leaves a note on my mirror:  
**“Konting push na lang, babe.”**

He finishes work at 5 a.m., but instead of heading home, he waits for me. Every single day.

Sometimes he’s outside my building, leaning against a post, holding a cup of coffee. Sometimes he’s at the 7-Eleven nearby, half-asleep, waiting. He never complains. He never makes a big deal out of it. He just waits—quietly, patiently, like it’s the most natural thing in the world.

One time I asked, “Di ka ba napapagod?”  
He smiled and said, “Mas pagod ako pag wala ka.”

Last night was especially rough. Calls, system issues, and that kind of mental fatigue you can’t explain. I didn’t even want to talk. But when we got home, he gently pointed to the table.

“Initin mo na lang,” he said, then went to feed the cats.

There it was—**guisadong corned beef** with potatoes and egg. He’s not a cook. The first time he tried frying hotdogs, they came out like charcoal. But he’s been learning. Watching TikToks. Asking his mom. All because he wants me to come home to something warm.

I sat there, staring at the plate, and I cried. Not because of the food. Not even because of the exhaustion.  
But because of the effort. The waiting. The quiet love that doesn’t ask for recognition.

Lord, I know hindi lang ako ang pagod. But thank You. Thank You for giving me someone who waits. Who learns. Who shows up in the smallest, most consistent ways.

UGH

And the nerves stopping me from doing something. It FEELS like I’m planning to ask her on a date on horseback and with flowers, when I know it can just be as simple as a lunch or coffee. We talk, but I worry about how I may be the one going to her office rather than vice versa. Maybe I’m bugging her and she’s just polite. I would do that if an annoying but well-meaning coworker started showing up. But it feels nice. It doesnt feel awkward. We both laugh and talk and ask questions. 

And at the end of the day, the answer to all this: just do it. Rip the bandaid. Eff it. Put it out there and at least itll be closure at worst. 

But i dont want the crush to end either. I like the excitement. The butterflies. The reason to dress just a little bit better everyday because I might see HER. If I ask and it doesn’t go well, that ends too.

🪷 thoughts from the grip of depression:
Woke up today thinking ""how can I make today better than yesterday?"". I'm not prone to philosophical tendencies in the morning, so it was a curious thought to have and it stayed with me throughout the day. So, yes, I *was* late for work, but I *chose* to stop by an buy a coffee, I chose to not hurry. At work I was much calmer than in the last weeks and had a good talk with HR: tomorrow I'll be writing an email on how the recent in-fucking-sane situation affects me and my performance. Coz it does. And it bothers me coz I care and would like to do my job well. How can I, though, when the workload is enough for three people? After work had a good phone call with my sis and then bought a coffee (2nd one in the day, I know, I know. I'm a classic millennial who cannot afford a house. Instead of avocado toast, I leave my hard-earned money in coffee shops...) and went to my local park where I laid on the grass and read a book. Also journalled a bit. At home I did not fell asleep in my makeup unshowered, so there is SO much improvement comparing to yesterday....not a high bar maybe, coz I spent last night crying in my bed while playing stupid video games, but it is an improvement and that's what counts!

You should risk CPS taking your child away for such behaviour.

There are too many. Far too many, shitty parents who hand their kid an iPad, press play on cocomelon, and then 10 years later wonder why their kid's brain is fucking MUSH already at age 15.

If I showed my kid where to buy drugs, showed him how to consume porn, showed him videogames without teaching him self discipline, showed him how he can bully/get bullied on socials, introduce him into sketchy individuals, show him how to get easy casual sex...

If I did any single one of those things. It's immoral, abusive and sometimes out right illegal. I could risk a CPS visit for that.

And yet. I can leave the key, the access, the door, to each and every one of those things, fully charged, sitting out on the living room coffee table, for anyone to discover.

And no one bats an eye.

No law saying I can't hand him the iPad, open every sketchy site I know, and then leave the house.

That is not illegal to do.

Cocaine should not be left on the table with kids in the house.

There are no laws. No regulations. No guidelines. No shame. And no prevention of kids getting the key to those doors.

There is no law saying you have to child-lock certain websites. There is no law saying you can't give your 7 year old an Instagram account. There is not, one *single* law about this.

There needs to be. Like there needs to be a drinking age and driving age. It is a responsibility children are not ready for.

And it's fucking corroding the youths minds. You can even ask gen Alpha and young genZ themselves. They'll tell you they fully agree with me.

The vast majority of adolescent kids will say that social media/the internet should be restricted for kids under a certain age. There is video surveys asking kids this.

Literally most advocate for it. The brain rot kids themselves, ***know***  that they are rotting their brains. They are literally directly telling adults, ""the internet is a net bad for us"" and yet all law makers and activists are just completely sleeping on the issue. All we do is say ""the internet is addictive and bad for young brains."" And then we all keep doing the same thing.

Humans are so cooked for so many different reasons. But once all the boomers/gen X die, and young GenZ and Gen alpha try to replace them in the workforce.....?

In 20 years time, I predict the highest rates of substance abuse and unemployment ever in recorded history, due to children who been internet junkies since age 6.

Link to tool above!

I saw tons of posts about making FIFA career mode more realistic, and my original tool helped with player sell values and a starting 11 tracker. Now, I’m pumped to share a MAJOR update to Version 2.0 with even more features! It’s got a slick new look and some awesome additions—check it out:

* **Club Details**: Enter your club’s league, country, and European status to get a custom scout star rating (2-10 stars!) with specific scouting ranges—like worldwide for 10 stars or just local country for 2 stars.
* **Career Checklist**: Track signings, sales, and youth promotions with summer and winter window limits (e.g., 2 starting signings in summer, 1 in winter) and unlock extras when you sell players. Reset with one click!
* **Starting 11 Calculator**: Input your lineup’s overalls and wages to find your team’s average overall, max signing overall (+2), and wage cap (120% of the highest wage).
* **Transfer Calculators**: Calculate minimum sell offers based on buyer stature and starting bids/wages for buying, adjusted by age and your team’s average.
* **Save/Load**: Save all your data (club, starting 11, checklist) to a JSON file and load it anytime.
* **Help/Info**: Quick guide on using everything, plus a link to support the project!

This update brings a revamped UI, better progress tracking, and new scout range messages. I’ve got more ideas brewing, so any suggestions are welcome.

1kt57rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kt57rn/a_cabin_encounter_deep_in_the_michigan_woods/,A Cabin Encounter Deep in the Michigan Woods,"Opening day of deer season in northern Michigan is viewed more as a holiday than just another outdoor activity. People from all over the state come in droves filling all the campgrounds, hotels, and bars the night before. I never understood that, mixing alcohol and deer rifles. Most of these people don’t care if they even see a deer, they take this time to escape their everyday life and just relax. Although, some are too hungover to even get up the next morning and track through the woods to their hunting spot. 

Our family is fortunate. We have resided in the small town of Grayling, Michigan since the early 1930s. We have a couple hundred acres of land that is used primarily for farming and hunting. There are Whitetail mounts displayed in all of our homes that can attest to how fruitful our land is. We used to get together the night before opening day and partake in several intense poker and euchre games. Additionally, we would take this time to do some last-minute strategizing and go over our gear by doing a mental checklist.

Our opening day gathering spot was held in our family cabin that is set deep in the woods on our property. To get to this location, you would have to turn on four-wheel-drive and travel via a rugged two track that would bounce your head off the truck roof if you weren’t holding on. Concussions aside, it is a very beautiful location. The cabin consists of one bathroom and two bedrooms with a pair of bunk beds in each, and a pullout couch in the living room. The main living area is an open concept space with the living room, kitchen, and dining room connected. Signal is nonexistent at the cabin, so there is a vast collection of magazines, books, and VHS tapes for an ancient TV that I don’t think has been used in over a decade. However, these items have a thick layer of dust on them due to the fact that camaraderie at the cabin leaves little to no time for boredom. Unfortunately, this was not the case, a couple years back. As the years went by, fewer and fewer hunters made the trip to the family cabin. The cabin, as I wish to remember it, was once a place full of family, friends, and great memories, but is now tarnished by a sickening nightmare.

The weather that night was frigid cold and upon my arrival to the cabin I immediately started a fire in the wood stove. This would prove to do very little to take the frigid edge off. Snow fell around the cabin, creating a thick layer of fluff that muffled any sound creating an eerie quietness. I remember standing over the fire, cooking a can of soup that sat upon the stove. Next to it, a pot of water was boiling to make a cup of hot chocolate.

 I knew I was going to be there for only one night, but I remember feeling especially lonely. This was because for the first time in camp history only one person was staying in the cabin that November night. My family all had something else going on. My dad had started a new job that had him working the next morning, although he didn’t mind, because it was a great step up from his previous job. My uncle and cousin were going to hunt at another location that was over an hour away, which meant they would have to get up around 3 AM to make the drive to their hunting blind. I didn’t blame them for wanting to sleep a little longer.

So there I was with my tin can meal walking over to dust off the VHS tapes when I looked outside and saw something standing outside the front window. It was looking right at me. I nearly flipped backwards, trying to get away while bumping into the dining room table. I refocused all my attention on the front window, but there was nothing. I could’ve sworn I saw a dark figure standing outside but there were no tracks in the snow. I chalked it up to the snow falling a certain way giving off a false illusion, and possibly a small case of cabin fever. I turned on every light in the cabin, not wanting to see outside any longer and risk being fooled again by my overactive imagination.

I was a third of the way through my movie with an empty soup can and a half drunk cup of hot chocolate in front of me on the carved wooden coffee table. Sprawled out on the dining room table and chairs was my hunting clothes and other gear. I had cleaned my rifle earlier in the night and laid it in the corner of the room by the head of the couch just a couple of feet away from where I was sitting. The movie had ended, and I laid there staring up at the ceiling when a wave of horrific emotions came over me, I was being watched. I was scanning the windows, trying to figure out where the hollowed stair was coming from, when I saw it. 

Across the living room, my great grandfather‘s prized deer mount hung just above the entertainment center and was supposed to be facing the back of the cabin, but was looking right at me. I started to scream as its neck made a series of popping noises. It sounded like bones and flesh tearing from their joints. The monstrosity began to look me up and down. Another loud pop erupted the room as the animal’s lower jaw fell to the floor, creating a loud thud and sending teeth flying all over the wooden floor. When I thought my screams couldn’t get louder. I jolted up from the couch, covered in sweat, it had been a dream. I sat there with my heart beating through my chest. I looked over at the clock on the microwave to see that it was 3 o’clock in the morning. The deer mount across the room was looking in its proper direction, but I did not care to stare for more than a couple seconds to ease my worries.

 I stood up, feeling like I was being watched, still, which was to be expected after a nightmare as hellish as that. The fire in the stove had burned down to just glowing coals so I got it going to roaring flames again. I went over to the sink to fill the pot full of water to prepare coffee for the morning hunt that would begin in a couple hours. Halfway through filling the pot I heard a sound that made my heart skip a beat. The floorboard behind me creaked and with it came the vibration of a footstep. I was frozen where I stood. I didn’t know whether to turn around and look, or try to do some kind of move to get away from whatever it was that was behind me. I worked up the courage and slowly turned around. There was nothing.

At this point I was thoroughly spooked. No, in fact, I was straight up terrified. Between the figure outside that I had tried to convince myself wasn’t real, the horrifying nightmare, and now the sensation of someone standing right behind me, I knew I wanted to leave. I told myself there was only a few more hours until I would make the journey to my deer blind, and an hour or so after that that would bring the security of daylight. Then it hit me, a thought that hadn’t crossed my mind. I was supposed to leave the cabin and walk through the darkness of the forest. This sent shivers down my spine. I knew I would have my rifle with me for protection, but this still didn’t put my mind at ease. What I was dealing with didn't feel natural. I sat back down on the couch and began to think about how I wanted the morning to go. I determined that I would walk my blind around 5:30 to get there before daylight came. I would’ve normally left sooner, but this would’ve allowed much less sitting time in the dark blind before the sun illuminated through the trees. 

I had somehow managed to doze off sitting up on the couch, but was awakened by a pounding on the cabin door. This erupted a fear through me like I had never experienced before. I stood there, staring at the door, waiting for another dreadful knock. Instead, my dad‘s deep voice came booming from the opposite side of the door. He sounded concerned, so I rushed to the door to see what had brought him all the way out here so early in the morning. I went to open the door, but stopped. This made no sense. The door was unlocked. My dad might have given a courtesy knock, but then he would’ve just let himself in. I knew I had fallen asleep, but I believe I would’ve heard his diesel truck pull up to the cabin. I took another step back and saw something in the corner of my eye. To the right of the cabin door hung a mirror that reflected most of the living room and kitchen area. What caught my eye was the reflection of a figure that crouched behind me in the middle of the room, ready to pounce. The sight of this thing made me want to puke. It was a deer that had flesh hanging from its body. The antlers on it jutted out in several different directions. It was covered in infectious decaying skin. Then the pungent smell hit me like a ton of bricks and made me gag. A familiar sound echoed in the cabin. It was the popping noise I heard in my dream that had come from the deer mount. This creature thrusted its body backwards, causing it to now stand on its hind legs. I had to get out of there. The keys to my vehicle hung below the mirror on an antler that we had screwed into the wall to make a homemade key rack. I grabbed them and flung the door open. The sound of hooves chased behind me clacking against the floorboards. I must’ve hit the unlock button on my key fob 20 times before reaching my truck, even though it was only a few yards from the cabin. I jumped in and floored it out of there, not daring to look back.

I’ve never returned to the cabin. The land that the cabin sits on is currently pending sale with a couple of guys from downstate trying to buy. I hope it doesn’t go through. The only advice I have for you is if you come across an abandoned cabin in the north-central Michigan Woods do not approach it. In fact, get out of those woods as fast as possible.

***Wednesday***

It was a quiet affair when Gerry and I came out for breakfast. Boyd, Lucas and Mason had already eaten and left, and Mom and Dad were rarely ever home anymore, so all that was left at the table besides us were Brock, Robbie, Charlie and Kulon. I couldn’t remember the last time our meal had had so few people, and it seemed I wasn’t the only one who thought so.

Brock raised his cupped hands to his lips and called out, “Echo!”, then dropped his voice to repeat the word several more.

I chuckled, and Gerry shook her head. Charlie elbowed Brock, who was cackling like it was the funniest thing he’d ever heard. “Dork,” she smirked as Brock righted himself in his seat.

Robbie stood beside Kulon on the other side of the island, dishing everything up.

“You know,” I said, eyeing the plates of sliced fruit, yoghurt, granola, pancakes, a large omelette loaded with more extras than a works burger and fresh bread rolls. “Much more of this and I’m never gonna go back to cereal and toast in the morning ever again.” I deliberately avoided looking at the one yolk-filled, raw mince monstrosity that Kulon pulled towards himself.

Brock claimed the pancake stack, reaching for the jug of maple syrup which he proceeded to drown the stack under. *Literally.* It pooled at the bottom, and if it weren’t for the raised lip on the edge of the plate, it would’ve gone all over the island.

“Dude!” I groused, for my girl had a sweet tooth, too, and for that jerk claiming the whole stack for himself like that…

“It’s okay, honey-bear,” Gerry said quietly from my right, squeezing my hand. “I’d like a slice of the omelette, please.”

I turned to look at her, determined to deduce if she truly meant that or if this was her way of smoothing things over. “Are you sure?” I asked, since she didn’t appear under duress, but a lifetime of masking her desires around others made it challenging to decipher.

“Positive. I know it sounds cliché, but it smells divine.”

Now it was Brock’s turn to groan, going as far as to drop his head to his chest. My concerns disappeared, and I grinned and high-fived my girl, who was snickering at her awful pun.

“Alright then, sweet pea. One omelette with a side of buttered bread rolls, as per your request,” Robbie declared, cutting the omelette into three and sliding a third onto a plate, along with two heavily buttered bread rolls. He then picked up the plate and extended his arm to deposit it before my girl. “Bon appétit,” he said, in the worst French accent I’d ever heard.

“Man, you really gotta get out into the world more. That accent was the pits,” I laughed.

“Like you could do any better,” Charlie jeered, reaching across the table for a blueberry muffin.

Seeing her defend Robbie, even if we were goofing around, was awesome.

*“Vous seriez surprise,”* I said in fluent French, adding a brief eyebrow waggle for good measure. It had been a long time since I’d dug out Captain Rousset’s native tongue, and I could never hope to hold up my end of a conversation with a true French citizen, but it was fun to mess with my friends.

Captain Rousset was undoubtedly the best captain Greenpeace ever had, but eighty percent of what came out of his mouth was French, and it was a steep learning curve for the rest of us, especially when that percentage rose along with his legendary temper. Fluent French only came to the forefront when he was getting ready to toss someone overboard—and he was big enough to do it, too.

So, of course, my girl became super excited by that. “I *savais pas que* you spoke French! *Quelles* other languages *cannais-tu?”*

*“Ralentir … ralentir…”* I cautioned, picking out a smattering of words from that spiel that sent me right back to my earliest days serving under Captain Rousset. I could probably still hold my own if she slowed right down, or at least muddle my way through the conversation, but not at full speed with a heavy dose of excitement. *“Je suis* …uhrrrmmm…” I internalised, searching through my memories for the French word for rusty.  *“Rouilli?”*

I noticed we had everyone’s attention then, and Kulon was chuckling to himself as he ate, because the true gryps could speak in all tongues, courtesy of what they were … along with being totally obnoxious jerks.

I had never been so tempted to flip him the bird in my life.

“When did you learn French?” Brock asked, surprise landing on his face first, then devolving into something sharper.

I couldn’t understand the latter. “I served on a boat with a French-speaking captain for nearly two years. I probably know more swearing than the actual language, but it was easier for me at twelve to learn French than for him at a hundred to learn English, especially when he insisted on it. Mom’s way better at it.” My gaze swept the room to see if anyone else understood why Brock seemed upset by that before refocusing on my friend. “What’s the big deal, man?”

He sighed and went back to eating his pancakes. “Nothing.”

Okay, even at my most ignorant, I knew that word was the kiss of death to whatever the present subject matter was, and I refused to let that be us. Sliding off my seat, I went around Robbie and Charlie’s seats to arrive behind Brock, where I wrapped both arms around him and pinned his arms to his sides.

“Hey, what the—? Lemme go, you jerk!”

“Nope. Either you say what’s bugging you, or I take this to the next level … by introducing my wet finger to your ear.”

“Ewww, gross! Don’t you dare! That’s Robbie’s move! Robbie! Robbieeee! Heeeelllp!” he squealed, squirming even as I made a production of bracing him in one arm while slurping loudly around my little finger. No one moved to help him, which told me he needed this as much as I did.

It still didn’t stop him from trying to break free. He threw his feet against the island and shoved backwards, but I’d taken things up a notch divinely, so I didn’t budge. And as I released my little finger with a lip-smacking pop, I held it out where he would see it. “Last chance…” I caroused. 

“Robbieeeeeee,” he wailed.

“Don’t hurt him,” was all Robbie said as he continued to dish up everyone’s preferences.

I twisted him sideways and pinned his head against Mason’s seat, but instead of giving him a wet willie, I waited a few seconds (just to prove I could’ve followed through and chose not to) and then scruffed his hair and hauled him back up into his seat. I kept one arm wrapped around him to keep us connected. “Talk to me, man. We’ve been friends and roommates for too long.”

“That’s the point, though, isn’t it?” he asked, squirming in my grip and sighing while staring at the ceiling as if I was killing him by not letting him go. “We lived together for years, and you never once said you spoke French.”

“Seriously?” Without Mason in attendance, I slid around into Mason’s seat side-on to face him. “Why would it ever come up? I spent eighteen months working under Captain Rousset, and I picked up bits and pieces the longer he shouted at us. It’s not like I studied the language or anything worthy of praise. Any time you wanna doubt that, just remember how much Kulon was laughing his butt off over there at the way I was stumbling my way through it.”

“It’s true,” Kulon chuckled, nodding in agreement with himself because just saying the words wasn’t enough. He pointed his chopsticks at me. “You should be humiliated.”

I ignored the barb, focusing entirely on my friend. “Come on, man,” I said, as it was my turn to feel hurt. “Don’t be like this. We know what matters about each other, and that’s more important, isn’t it?”

Brock immediately twisted out of his seat and slammed against me, wrapping his arms around my waist. My arms banded around him, holding him close. He didn’t apologise, nor did I expect him to. This was our agreement, our apology, and our … *‘us’* … all rolled into one, right here.

“So, what’s your plan for today besides more homeschooling?” I asked Robbie over Brock’s shoulder, if only to break the silence.

Brock pulled away from me, his eyes shining with excitement. “Robbie wants to take me to go and talk to God.”

“Really?” My gaze swivelled back to Robbie, who didn’t deny it, or even pause while dishing up the last breakfasts.

“I need to clarify a few things about Brock’s soul, so I don’t make any assumptions or accidentally offend him,” he said.

“Okay,” I said, even if inwardly I was asking, *‘And Brock's presence fits into that where exactly?’* I made a point of letting Brock go, moving around the island to where Robbie was standing, and placing a hand on his shoulder as if he had my full support.

Not that he didn’t, but I had an ulterior motive for doing this … mainly the Heavenly eyes that I had wrapped around my bare ankle that (as far as I was aware) couldn’t lipread through an island bench.

I remembered Uncle YHWH saying he could be anywhere he needed to be, provided he had enough warning to get there. Hopefully, this would give him that warning. “You’re talking about that big Catholic Church in the heart of the city, right? St…”

“St Patrick’s, yes.”

*You’re welcome, Uncle YHWH.*

“When were you planning on doing that?”

“Not until after Mrs Parkes leaves this afternoon. Larry’s bringing Rory over to work on Charlie’s garage…”

Charlie squealed and pushed back from the island, almost toppling her chair in her haste to stand up. “He’s coming here! Now?!”

“As soon as I call Larry to let him know, yeah. Right now, he’s gone to help Rory get things ready to start. Don’t worry, sweet pea. You’ve got plenty of time. Larry won’t let him in until we’re ready to see him, and he knows we’re having breakfast right now. He’s already told me Rory doesn’t want to come over until Sam and Gerry have headed out for school.”

“I can understand why *we* don’t want that to happen, but why is *he* worried about meeting *me?”* I asked, my confusion evident. In my head, I pictured him somehow knowing about me and deciding he didn’t like me.

That had Robbie snickering. “Because … dear cuz … he’s apparently deluded enough to think the world revolves around him, and the less people we have here fawning all over his magnificence, the faster the job will get done.”

That took a second to sink in, and when it did, I screwed my face up so badly I could barely see him through my slatted lids. “Wow. *Really?”*

Robbie bit his lips together and made an affirmative sound.

“Okay, so he’s a douche.”

“I’ll wait until I meet him myself before I officially make that judgment call, but all evidence points to ‘yes’.”

“Aren’t you worried you’ll be recognised? And what if he sees…” My head swivelled to the coffee table where the family carving usually sat, only this time, the table was noticeably clear. “Oh.”

“Yeah, after the fiasco Monday, Boyd took the carving with him into his studio on his way to the gym this morning. He’ll bring it back tonight after Rory goes home.”

I eyed Robbie closely. “What about you, Robbie? Are you going to be alright, being here with this new family member flitting around?”

“I’ll be fine. Larry will be right here the whole time. If anything, the fact that he doesn’t see me cooking and merely getting finished things out of Voila will only emphasise that this *cooking cousin* he’s heard of is someone else, not me.”

“Why does he know about your innate?”

“I made him and Larry up a couple of pizzas for breakfast. Apparently, Rory recognised an innate in play when he tasted it.”

“Well, duhhhh,” Brock drawled out, attacking his pancake stack with even more gusto than before.

“Someone’s bucking for instant oatmeal and two-minute noodles for a week,” Robbie warned, though his lips were fighting a grin as he spoke.

Brock gagged, and it was comical to see how wide he could make his eyes go. “Does anyone happen to know the number for CPS?” he asked innocently. “Just asking for a friend.”

“If your *‘friend’* plays that card, I’ll make it a year to have it worth my while.”

“So, back to your meeting with Uncle YHWH,” I said, before things stopped being light-hearted. “Were you wanting a ride with us, or are you going to realm-step straight there as soon as Mrs Parkes leaves?”

Robbie squinted. “What’s with the twenty questions?”

I froze for a second and then wanted to slap myself for the momentary panic as I internalised to play out my options. It took me ages to come up with one I thought he might buy. “We’ve been taking some of our newbies home after school, but if you need a lift to the church, we’ll have to tell them no.”

Robbie shook his head. “I still want to be here when you get home so we’ll realm-step there and back.”

“You might want to reach out to Lady Col to make sure he knows you’re coming,” I said, swiping a triangle of French toast and biting off the corner, more so to make my conversation appear inconsequential than to satisfy my hunger. “I heard she’s tight with the Archangel Michael and as the big boss of Heaven’s military, he’s bound to have Uncle YHWH’s ear.”

It wasn’t a lie, and if in case Michael happened to be somewhere else, Uncle YHWH would still know Robbie’s looking for him courtesy of my ophanim set. *Win/win.*

“That’s … actually not a bad idea. I’ll reach out to her when I get a second and see if she can—” He straightened up, his eyes going wide. “Wow! That is such a head trip.” His gaze met mine. “We’re talking about the archangel Michael here!”

“Yeah, but he’s also an egotistical, self-opinionated douchebag, too.”

That drew me almost everyone’s attention. Geraldine and Kulon were the only ones focused more on their food than me, since they’d been there at the time. I sighed and rubbed my forehead. “I met him Sunday morning, after Gerry and I visited her dad and before I caught up with mine and met Uncle Barris. Michael was here waiting for me downstairs, and basically, he’s not just a tool – he’s the whole toolbox.”

“What happened?”

“He couldn’t realm-step me because I’m Dad’s kid, and he got all bent out of shape about it.”

“He was scary,” Gerry agreed, from our end of the island.

At Robbie’s crestfallen expression, I winced and tried to think of something comforting to say. “I guess it’s true what they say about never meeting your heroes, right?”

“Clefton’s cool,” Gerry piped up from the other end of the island.

I loved that she was so comfortable with us that she would say her mind as it came to her. “Yeah, angel. Him and Nick are the exceptions.”

“What about you?” Robbie asked. “You’ve met him a few times now. Did he give you a means of contacting him?”

*“Me?”* *Again with the panic!* When was I going to get it through my thick skull that I could internalise straight away instead of panicking?! After another lengthy stay in my imagination, I answered with, “He said if I spoke out loud saying where and when I wanted to meet him, he’d hear me and be there. Given how much he hates setting foot outside of Heaven, I have to assume he’s using his angels as proxies.” *See? Not a lie anywhere in sight.*

“So, if I said to you, I’m going to be at the St Patricks’ cathedral at ten to three this afternoon…”

“There’s a good chance he’ll meet you there. At least, that’s been my experience, so far.” Man, I was so close to lying, I *almost* wanted a shower. But I hadn’t crossed the line yet, and Robbie knew that flaw in my personality.

After squinting at me, waiting to see if I would beeline for the bathroom, he relaxed. “Well, okay, then. We’ll try for that and leave Michael out of it completely.”

I grinned and gave him a one-armed hug. “Sounds like a plan,” I said, returning to my seat where the middle third of the omelette and a bowl of yoghurt with granola and chopped fresh fruit awaited me.

She’s scared stray and has started to open up. Miller needs a local or out of state foster or adopter now. Discount transport available.","Update: Extended to 5/22 11am (lab starts at 1-1:30pm, meaning there is time)

Miller (A1241689) is a sweet gentle girl at Dallas Animal Shelter who is fully out of time and needs a Hail Mary. She is 2 years old and just over 50 lbs.

Miller has multiple options for getting out of this shelter safely —

A local rescue has offered to save Miller if she can find a foster. If you are local and wanted to foster rather than adopt, you can message Ruff Road Revival Rescue if local yourself directly on instagram, Facebook, or email. And message me so I can let them know ASAP

**If you are serious and her listing still up, click “I’m interested” and fill out the application immediately. Email still if not up. Consider calling as well.**

**Additionally another rescue can be asked to save Miller and arrange transportation a foster can steps up in another state.**

Another dog from DAS is being transported west to northern CA, so if you are anywhere along this route she could be transported for a potentially discounted rate for either a foster or adopter. 

**Additionally, transport is available to the any state or Canada for adoption, discounted and assisted by a local rescue who would like to help get her to forever. **They can temporarily foster until transport, but cannot take her into the rescue without a committed foster. 

Message me if interested in any of these options and I will help facilitate.

Meet Miller, a gentle 2-year-old soul who's looking for a patient and understanding companion. From our observations, Miller tends to be on the quieter side and may take some time to warm up to new people and surroundings. While she initially showed some hesitation during playtime, our volunteers noticed that she gradually became more interested in socializing with other dogs after getting acquainted. Miller seems to prefer a calm and gentle approach, making her a potential great fit for a low-key household.

Field Observation

02/27: FRIENDLY BUT VERY TIMID

Volunteer Observation

03/05: Avoidant/Fearful

[""Disinterested in Treats""]

[""Avoiding Eye Contact""]

Miller was quiet when I approached his kennel and stayed in the far corner.  She did NOT display any concerning behaviors of fear aggression, but it is evident she will take a while to warm up to anyone.  I offered her a treat, but she was not interested.

One month later:

04/06: Easy Going

Good Manners

Social (People);Loose/Wiggly Body

Love-Bug;Solicits Pets;Solicits Belly Rubs

Miller is a very sweet girl. Was easy to leash and walks well until all the dogs start to bark, then she gets a little nervous. Outside she wanted affection and when she saw a dog in the next yard, she went to say hi and showed signs of wanting to play.

Daycation Notes :

How did your dog do in the car? Eh, I tolerate riding in the car

Which of the following activities did the dog enjoy? Going on a walk, Lounging around a dog-friendly coffee shop / restaurant / bar

How did they interact with strangers? I love meeting new friends!

If they saw any cats, how did they react? N/A

If they saw any other dogs, how did they react? Miller was friendly with other dogs, but as people came by to interact with her and another daycation dog, she appeared to do better with individual attention on her or taking a step back while another dog received attention. While she did not appear to resource guard food or water, it is possible she is protective of attention from humans.

If they met any children, how did they react? Miller was gentle with children. She allowed pets, was calm and kept a loose, wiggly body.

How did I walk on the leash? (Examples: excited/pulling/timid/awesome walker)Walked well on leash. Was not a leash puller.

How were my manners and do I know any tricks? Good manners, Went to the bathroom immediately (when outside)

Did they show any of the additional behaviors listed below? Love bug, Solicits pets

The best part of my Daycation was when.......I got tons of treats and got to say hello to people

Any additional notes you would like to include about the dog? Miller is sweet a sweet girl!

Playgroup Assessment

03/10: PG1 Social , DG Dainty & Gentle

Timid, initially but slowly beginning to warm up to the other dogs. Would begin to show interest in socializing with the other dogs after getting the chance to get acquainted with them.

Shelter observations: 04/08: Vocal when greeted at kennel door but tail wagging. Easily leashed and easy to walk but was nervous to walk past other kennels. Non-reactive to other dogs in kennels. In the yard she pottied (1 and 2) right away. A little skittish with me initially but warmed up after a few minutes in the yard together. Allowed pets but wasn't overly affectionate. **Sweet and gentle dog. **

Miller is currently at risk due to space in the shelter and needs placement by 11 am May 22nd.

Please email dasadopt@das.gov if you are interested in adopting.

I counter this by going for 30-60 min walks but even then I just feel like shit afterward and need to lay down. 


- I cannot get to sleep as easily at night even with 8000 combos of sleep hygiene I’ve tried so I end up oversleeping the next day and ruin my own plans or if I am forced to wake up for work or whatever I feel like a zombie 


- my brain does not power on at all to full capacity so I feel like my brain is made out of concrete and it makes studying extremely difficult and slow. I do one lecture or report paragraph and I need to sit down and close my eyes immediately. 


- my hunger is either dialed to 10000000 or 0 and will not go away. So I either have to force myself to eat and feel sick or force myself to stop eating and feel extremely crabby. I don’t restrict myself or have an ED but I am trying to maintain a certain physique and my hunger cues do not work like a normal person so I do have to eat mindfully- during luteal I just don’t have any sense of anything 

- don’t even get me started on the bloat and weight gain. Why the fuck did I put on 2fuckin kilograms over night?!!!? I was asleep???



- I love a coffee and energy drink but I can’t during luteal because for whatever reason the crash I get afterward is insane. I can literally have a small latte at 11am and then I’ll nap for 3 hours at 1pm. I can’t treat myself to a nice coffee :((((((((( 


- impulse control is 0. I have to avoid people, shopping ANYTHING. I know I’m responsible for my own behaviour but the urge to over shop or say really unhinged things is crazy!! Good bye social life for an entire week


- if I am alone with my thoughts for 10 seconds I start spiralling and thinking the entire world and all my friends hate me, I’m going to lose my job. I’ve gotten better at acknowledging hey this isn’t real it’s your PMDD but having those thoughts there at all genuinely upsets me


- I cry over everything, the smallest thing will send me into an angry rage. It’s wild because a week before when I was NORMAL I am not really a very outwardly emotional person so I was fine. Yesterday my stick vacuum fell off the charger and scared me so I immediately started swearing and crying and had a full mental break and had to go to my room at 7pm to get ahold of myself. 


Every. Dam. Month. I can’t workout, study, work, eat, sleep, yknow do fundamental things for myself like normal and I never know WHICH day the bullshit is going to commence. I feel like 2 different people  fused into one. My good weeks feel like borrowed time. I accept that I have this dam disorder but lordt I am TIREDDDDDDDDD

I am on ssri, all the clinically backed vitamins, medicated for my other mental health issues (I have adhd what a shock lmao) and I eat what I’d consider a pretty healthy diet and avoid inflammatory food and drink. 


I get enough sleep, exercise bla bla. My blood work is fine. My doctor does the usual “you are perfectly healthy :).” Nothing has truly alleviated this. 

I’ve had enough. I just wanna have a normal month REEEEEEE


Ok thanks for listening xx

But to the point, my fiance has one complain about me. ""You don't pick up after yourself"". Now, before everyone says it's on me, hear me out. It's not that I don't, it's that it's not when she would. So say the Kuerig. She's screamed at me, yes screamed, about how it boggles her mind why I can't take the cup immediately to the trash. As in, the coffee is still dripping into the cup, I'm not even near it yet, and am getting up to get my coffee. To which she'll storm over, take the pod out and toss it going ""See how easy that was?"". Recently it was over a bit of dogfood that was in the drain catch. I was still actively cleaning around the sink before I'd toss the catch, and scrub the basin. When I mean she went in, she went in. For 15 minutes. And when I shut down and stopped responding, she got mad at that as well. I know I'm far from perfect, but the way she lashes out is unreasonable. Another, for two weeks after a vet surgery, I was given a list of ""Don'ts"" to follow while my buddy's stitches heal. One of them, since he was thick fur (German shepherd) was that I'm not allowed to brush or bathe him for those two weeks. We're at her father's house during his healing process and when I'm out getting things for lunch, I come back and she's telling me her dad simply gave her a brush and said to brush him, which she knows was a major no-no. A bit extra to be so on top of the list? Maybe, but he's my buddy and I wanted to make sure he healed completely. She lashed out at me that night a out how her dad ""Yelled at her"" to do it. Mind you, I've been there during one of these ""Yellings"". He doesn't, at all. Even though he's partially deaf. I'm at a loss. I've been putting up with this for close to a year. She thinks it's nagging, its not. Its just verbal attacks. She's even done it when there's nothing to pick up. As in, its already been done. Any advice? At all? I dont want to just leave her, but the amount of times shes raised her voice at me is getting me and is causing me to have my guard up constantly. Any advice would help.

My immediate family like mom, dad & brother came and then others like my aunts, cousins, and grandma showed up. It was great! We went kayaking the day before graduation & it was so fun! My cousin who is 29 cried during it because she was frustrated, but she got to the end and felt better lol. Anyway, my brother texts the family group chat to tell everyone to meet him and my dad the next morning at 7:30 AM so that they can all go together. My mom and I had to go earlier so I could get situated for the ceremony. However, in the morning my aunt (mother of the crying cousin), crying cousins sister & her two kids & the crier said that they would just meet the family at the stadium. This was odd, but whatever I had to focus on myself getting there. Fast forward to me walking out for the ceremony with my classmates and I see my mom, grandma, brother, etc. and I wave at them. But there are multiple seats surrounding them that are empty. No crying cousins sister & her family to be seen. Fast forward again to me walking out after the ceremony and I wave to mom again, AND THE SEATS ARE STILL EMPTY. I look up and see aunt of crying cousin with her grandson and I wave. It’s odd because they are up in the balcony area away from our other family members, but hey, thanks for making it. 
We are now outside and I find my family and we take pics and I ask “Where’s (crying cousin’s real name)?” My brother looks kind of uncomfortable and was like “Well, they didn’t make it. We don’t know where they are.” Aunt of crying cousin has disappeared as well. That side of the family is nowhere to be found and pictures are taken without them. Super weird. Anyway, it’s 11 PM and catering gets to the house for the party at 2:00 PM. My mom, friend and I go get coffee and something light to eat and hang out at the Airbnb to get situated for the party. 2 PM comes and so does the catering. We start to get plates to eat when suddenly the door opens and crying cousin, other cousin & her children, & auntie come through the door. Crying cousin runs up to me and hugs me and says “CONGRATULATIONS!!!” And I say “Thank you” but feel odd. They carry on about their business and do not say a word about missing my graduation. Not a single word. The party carries on and not a word. I try to hang out with my friend to get away but crying cousin keeps butting in and being domineering of the conversation. It’s now 5 pm and we all need to leave for the concert we’re going to at 7: 30 PM. As my friend and I are driving along I am becoming PISSED OFF. Slowly second by second I am more angry. We get to the concert and my mom has the tickets and is scanning everyone in at the gate when crying cousin shows me her new hat with my university on it and says “Do you like my hat?!” And apparently I made a face because she asks “You don’t like it?” And I turned to her and said “A hat from the university’s graduation that you didn’t go to?” She….FLIPPED. She suddenly starts to scream at me WE COULDN’T FIND PARKING!! WE HAD NO CHOICE!!! Her arms are open wide as she is screaming at me and I see my poor brother who is peaking on shrooms disperse with the rest of my family from the situation. My mom suddenly jumps in and screams GET IN!! EVERYBODY GO! And crying cousin lives up to her name and cries with her arms crossed and walks into the concert venue and up the hill away from all of us with her niece and nephew who are 19 & 21 comforting her. I then had a great time at the concert lol.
Any way, long story short crying cousin ignored me the rest of the trip and laughed too hard when jokes at my expense came up. The other family members apologized, but before they left I went & addressed the crier about what happened and guess what? SHE CRIED. She said they had no choice, I asked why didn’t you get out of the car and let your sister find parking, she said “I’m not just going to leave my sister.” Apparently I was an idiot to even suggest that. &&& they also went to Longhorn steak house after my graduation that they missed. “But they only got salads.”
Sooooo….there’s more to the story but yeah. I mean I feel completely disrespected. I felt like I wasn’t even allowed to be upset. They truly feel like they did nothing wrong and if I bring it up they flip. I just feel hurt that I worked so hard for that masters and they just put such little effort into that one moment. They even took from it. I don’t understand & the disrespect and lack of empathy is crazy. I just feel like I don’t truly matter to some of my family.",1,1747955179.0,family,1,0.57,False
1kt4p0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/GCSE/comments/1kt4p0h/feedback_on_my_q5_story_about_the_building_of_an/,Feedback on my q5? (story about the building of an amazing city),"Emma Frost sighed tiredly, already bored of this pointless affair and deeply regretting ever agreeing to sponsor Xavier's foolish project. Everyone in the room with her believed that to build a city you needed construction workers, architects and urban planners, but Emma Frost knew that they were wrong. It didn't make any difference whether you had the most productive, most creative, most ingenious people in the world working on your project, nothing would come into fruition without one thing: money.



Emma Frost had money, and she flaunted it. Her knee-high boots were always designer, her tops and skirts always freshly dry-cleaned and sharp, shocking silver, and her well-manicured hands were always shaking under the weight of her many diamond rings. She always stalked the streets alone, or in a blinding white Lamborghini - there was no need for relationships or even companionship when you had riches. Diamonds were a girl's best friend, after all. Emma had been taught that from her earliest days, since she could first remember the other girls in her class laughing at her because she was too short, too fat, too stupid to make anything of herself in life. But she had proved them wrong. Her ambition had been a relentless tsunami, sweeping away any obstacles and people in her path, until only the road to power remained. And now, as the owner of Frost Enterprises, the largest metal manufacturer in the whole world, Emma knew those girls were green with envy. That thought filled her with deep satisfaction. 



But being such a powerful businesswoman came with its disadvantages, such as having to sit in on endless tedious meetings with the mayor of whateverville and politicians from irrelevant towns, trying to leach some money away from Emma's hard-earned riches. Rarely, however, those random politicians had good ideas, like Charles Xavier. Emma sighed as he thought of him - if it wasn't for meeting that blasted man, she would be sitting in a jacuzzi drinking a flute of champagne, instead of having to listen to monotone men ramble on about geology. But, speaking of men, Emma remembered a conversation that had certainly not been boring.



Emma's mind flitted back a few weeks, to her first meeting with the man, as she remembered the conversation that had started this whole affair. He had seemed like an any run-of-the-mill unassuming middle-aged man - bald, pale and dressed like Emma's great-uncle, in a deeply ugly red waistcoat and scruffy trousers the colour of human excretion. The only thing that marked with man as any different from the hundreds of other beggars that came to Emma's doorstep was Charles' stainless-steel wheelchair that glittered oddly in the morning light, but Emma had been ready to dismiss him anyway, before he had started speaking. And maybe Emma had been lacking in genuine human conversation or connection then, or maybe Charles had put cocaine in that iced-coffee he had offered her, but Emma had been rapt with attention as Charles explained his insane plan.

And when, positively shaking with anticipation and hope, he had asked her, ""Lady Frost, will you do me the honour of sponsoring the Krakoa project?""

She had agreed.

 

Emma sighed once again as she brought her attention back to the meeting, regretting her decision. Who knew developing and designing a whole new, completely self-sufficient city on the moon could be so mundane?

Sighing again, Emma decided that admiring her many rings was more important than listening to dullards speak about oxygen-flow and blueprints and other jargon. But a sudden lull in conversation stopped her narcistic musings, and she looked up to see the expectant eyes or all of Charles' architects, urban planners and construction workers staring right at her. Raising a single eyebrow, Emma waited for someone to speak. Maybe they had finally realised that it was money that made the world go round.

1kt4ony,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1kt4ony/second_interview_coffee_chat_after_a_vp_interview/,Second interview (coffee chat) after a VP interview at a big bank — what should I make of this?,"I recently applied for a position at one of the big banks and, to my surprise, got contacted for an in-person interview pretty quickly. The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP told me it would likely be closer to 2 weeks — so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the **same VP again**, this time for an **informal coffee chat**. Recruiter mentioned the first interview was “only an hour” and that VP didn’t get to ask everything she wanted to. The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the vibe was much more relaxed. She asked me a lot of personal questions about my background and interests — not too much technical or role-specific talk.

At the end, she told me she still has two more candidates to speak with by the end of this week (it's Thursday now, the coffee chat was yesterday). Before we parted ways, she reminded me I have her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions.

Some context: I’ve only been working in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first position in finance **outside of retail banking**. I’m a little anxious because I don’t have much experience, so I’m trying to read between the lines here.

**Is this second, informal meeting a good sign? Or is it just standard?**  
**And what should I be doing now while I wait?** Any advice on how to follow up or stay on their radar without overstepping would be appreciated.",1,1747955115.0,FinancialCareers,6,0.6,False

1kt4nnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kt4nnq/second_interview_coffee_chat_after_a_vp_interview/,Second interview (coffee chat) after a VP interview at a big bank — what should I make of this?,"I recently applied for a position at one of the big banks and, to my surprise, got contacted for an in-person interview pretty quickly. The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP told me it would likely be closer to 2 weeks — so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the **same VP again**, this time for an **informal coffee chat**. Recruiter mentioned the first interview was “only an hour” and that VP didn’t get to ask everything she wanted to. The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the vibe was much more relaxed. She asked me a lot of personal questions about my background and interests — not too much technical or role-specific talk.

At the end, she told me she still has two more candidates to speak with by the end of this week (it's Thursday now, the coffee chat was yesterday). Before we parted ways, she reminded me I have her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions.

Some context: I’ve only been working in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first position in finance **outside of retail banking**. I’m a little anxious because I don’t have much experience, so I’m trying to read between the lines here.

**Is this second, informal meeting a good sign? Or is it just standard?**  
**And what should I be doing now while I wait?** Any advice on how to follow up or stay on their radar without overstepping would be appreciated. ",0,1747955039.0,Advice,3,0.5,False

Extract taken from an instagram post

The juiciest scandal of the year at Kaverton University was the leaked sex tape of Elizabeth Fisher from the Art Department.
The video had been filmed in the presidential suite of a five-star hotel.
Elizabeth was completely naked, pressed against the floor-to-ceiling window by a man a full head taller than her. The sounds of their bodies moving in sync echoed steadily through the room. 

When they finished, the man leaned close to her ear and murmured, ""Good girl.""

That phrase hit the group chat like a bomb, sending shockwaves across campus.

""That voice… No way! Is that Daniel?""

""Elizabeth's got serious game if she landed one of the university's board members. No wonder all the girls who used to bully her suddenly shut up.""

""I always thought Elizabeth was some innocent girl. Turns out she's a calculating bitch—like mother, like daughter.""

When the news reached Elizabeth, she was in her dorm, knitting a scarf for Daniel Woolridge.

Her roommate blasted the video at full volume, passing the phone around with a mocking grin. 

She stretched her voice in exaggerated glee. ""Elizabeth, you're moaning like a pro. How much practice have you had?""

Laughter exploded around the room. 

Elizabeth froze, her face draining of color. The half-finished scarf slipped from her hands as she bolted out the door.

She stumbled to Daniel's office, desperate to confront him, to ask what was going on.

But just as she reached the door, she heard a voice inside—sarcastic and biting.

""Daniel, you didn't leave Elizabeth a shred of dignity, huh? You made sure her face was crystal clear in the video. She doesn't even have a chance to deny it.""

Elizabeth's mind went blank. A deafening roar filled her ears as cold dread swept through her body.

""She brought it on herself. Messing with the woman Daniel loves most? She got what she deserved.""

""Yeah, poor Daniel. Not only did he have to spread rumors about Elizabeth's mom being a homewrecker, but he also had to play the hero, pretending to protect her from bullies and acting like he was madly in love.""

""By the way, Daniel, when are you planning to tell her the truth? If she finds out the guy she's been in love with is actually her future brother-in-law, she's going to pass out on the spot!""

Daniel lounged on the couch, looking utterly at ease, a cigarette dangling between his fingers as he tapped the ashes into the tray. His face was unreadable behind a thin haze of smoke.

Noticing the silence, one of his friends quickly added, ""Feeling sorry for her? Don't forget that she went all out to get Cheryl exiled abroad for two whole years. Do you think we should just let her off the hook after that? Cheryl was starving and freezing out there!""

At the mention of Cheryl Fisher, Daniel finally stirred.

He stubbed out the cigarette and said calmly, ""We'll wait until Cheryl's back. That day also happens to be a special anniversary that Elizabeth has been looking forward to. I'll give her a little 'surprise.' She'll pay back everything she owes Cheryl."" 

Elizabeth's breath caught in her throat. 

Through the smoke, her eyes locked onto Daniel's cold, sharp profile. Something inside her cracked wide open. The pain in her chest nearly knocked her off her feet.

So, all those disgusting rumors about her mother—they'd come from him? His affection—his protection, it had all been part of his revenge. 

The woman he truly loved was Cheryl, her half-sister.

She couldn't bear to hear another word. Heart pounding, she turned and fled, stumbling blindly down the hallway. 

But she didn't get far.

A group of girls stepped into her path.

""Well, well, look who it is. The star of the sex tape!""

""Just came out of his office—what, couldn't wait to offer yourself up again?""

Elizabeth's face turned ghostly pale. She tried to push past them, but they shoved her back and forth like a toy.

Then, suddenly, Daniel's low, icy voice cut through the chaos. ""Laying a finger on Elizabeth right in front of me? You must have a death wish.""

No one knew when Daniel had left his office, but now his tall, broad-shouldered figure was striding calmly toward them.

The girls scattered like startled birds the moment they saw him.

Daniel walked up to Elizabeth and gently smoothed her windblown hair. As he bent down and looked into her eyes, his fingers brushed lightly across her cheek.

""Didn't I tell you? If anyone messes with you again, just say my name.""

The sharp, acrid smell of tobacco assaulted Elizabeth's senses, instantly irritating her eyes and making her throat feel tight and scratchy.

The Daniel standing before her blurred with the one from her memories—the man who had protected her time and time again. It felt like a dream from another life.

Back when her mother, Julia Bennett, had taken her own life, her father, Samson Fisher, had gone back to his first love, Wanda Payne, leaving Elizabeth in a home where she wasn't quite an orphan—but it sure felt like one.

Then the rumors began to spread at school that Julia had been a mistress, and that Cheryl was the rightful daughter of the Fisher family.

As ""the mistress' daughter"", bullying became her daily reality.

It was Daniel who had pulled her out of that hell. 

With nothing more than the weight of his name as a board member, he carved out a small, warm corner of the world just for her.

Just yesterday, on Daniel's birthday, the two of them had slept together, tipsy from too much wine. 

That night, Daniel had shed his usual refined, aloof image and pinned her against the floor-to-ceiling window with a hunger that left her trembling from nerves and fear. 

In that moment, when he took her for the first time, Elizabeth had felt like a lost bird finally finding its way home.

She had no idea that ""home"" was nothing more than a carefully laid trap.

Her mind swirled in a daze.

By the time she came back to her senses, Daniel was already leading her out of the administration building. She slid into the front passenger seat of his car without a word.

Chapter 2
As always, Daniel leaned over to buckle Elizabeth's seatbelt for her. Noticing the redness around her eyes, he spoke gently, his voice laced with reassurance.

""The video was an accident. I'll take care of it and make sure it's wiped clean. You're not in a good state today. Let me take you home so you can rest.""

Elizabeth pressed her lips together, but his earlier words echoed in her mind. Before she could stop them, tears spilled uncontrollably down her cheeks.

Daniel paused, clearly caught off guard. 

He reached up to wipe her tears, then almost as if something had just occurred to him, he opened the car door.  

""Wait here a second, I need to buy something.""

As the door shut behind him, Elizabeth noticed he'd left the wrong phone behind.

His phone sat in the cup holder between them. Almost without thinking, she picked it up and typed in Cheryl's birthday.

The screen unlocked instantly. 

At the top of his WhatsApp chats was Cheryl's name.

In their most recent messages, Cheryl had asked him if he could cut things off with Elizabeth before she came back home.

Daniel had replied, ""She's just a toy. I was never really with her.""

Elizabeth's chest tightened painfully. Fighting back the burning in her nose, she scrolled further up.

For the past two years, while Cheryl had been abroad, Daniel had called her every single night without fail, always around 8:00 pm—the same time he always told Elizabeth he was in board meetings and couldn't be disturbed. 

On top of that, he had been sending Cheryl money every month—six-figure transfers, clean and direct, with no note attached.

And Cheryl knew how to play it sweet too. 

Every now and then, she'd send him selfies, asking for compliments, and Daniel would reply with cute animal stickers—ones Elizabeth had never seen before—telling her not to wear so little, to stay warm, to take care of herself.

Staring at the chat history, Elizabeth finally understood. She had never truly known Daniel at all. The kindness he'd shown her, the tenderness, the care—it was only a sliver of the love he gave to Cheryl.

Daniel returned to the car with a small box of emergency contraceptive pills.

He gently stroked Elizabeth's hair, his voice soft, careful, just like always.

""Last night was a little rushed. I didn't take the right precautions. Take this, just in case.""

Elizabeth clutched the box so tightly her knuckles turned white. Her lips were pressed together so hard that they nearly bled.

If she hadn't heard it with her own ears, she might still have believed Daniel actually cared about her. 

But now, she was wide awake.

When the car pulled up in front of the villa, Daniel leaned in to kiss her goodbye like he always did. But this time, Elizabeth turned her head away and fumbled with her seatbelt.

Daniel's eyes darkened. He pulled her into his arms, holding her tight.

""Still upset about the video?"" he asked.

Elizabeth said nothing.

""I didn't film it. The hotel manager's already been fired."" 

He lifted her chin with a finger, his voice low and coaxing. ""Elizabeth, I never wanted to hurt you. I never will. Our anniversary's coming up—I'll make it up to you then.""

Lies dressed as kindness cut deeper than truth ever could.

Her nose stung. She pushed him away and muttered, ""I'm going in.""

She practically ran up the steps and into the villa.

The moment she stepped through the door, she ran straight into Samson. His face twisted with rage. Before she could even open her mouth, he raised his hand and slapped her hard across the face.

""Elizabeth, I underestimated you. You want to date someone, fine. But to film some filthy, disgraceful video? You've humiliated me completely!"" he shouted.

His voice was sharp, cutting, and merciless as he continued, ""No wonder everyone at your school picks on you. It's not because they're cruel; it's because you're disgusting and shameless. You're the rot that draws the flies!""

He threw a plane ticket at her feet. ""I booked you a flight for seven days from now. Get the hell out, and don't ever come back.""

Elizabeth bent down to pick it up. Her fingers trembled, as if the thin slip of paper weighed a hundred pounds. 

It felt less like a boarding pass and more like a final sentence—a declaration that the world itself had abandoned her. 

Samson thought she was a disgrace and just wanted her gone.

That was fine—Elizabeth didn't want to stay, either.

""I'll go,"" she said calmly. ""And I'll do as you said. I won't come back. Ever.""

Samson froze, thinking he must have misheard her.

Back when he had arranged for Cheryl to study abroad, he'd tried to convince Elizabeth to go too. But she had refused. 

After pressing her for a reason, he'd found out she was in love, head over heels, no less.

He'd assumed she would put up a fight again this time. He never expected her to agree so readily.

His anger cooled, if only just slightly. He spoke again, his voice sharp. 

""Cheryl's coming back this weekend. I'm throwing a welcome party for her. You'll be there. The video's already out. If you don't show your face, the rumors will only get worse.""

Elizabeth nodded. ""Got it.""

…

She requested three days off from school.

In that time, she gathered everything Daniel had ever given her and listed them all online for resale at full price.

Three days later, Cheryl returned.

Samson hosted a lavish welcome party for her at Kaverton's biggest hotel, inviting every major name in business and high society.

And Daniel was among them.

Elizabeth hadn't expected to see him there. The moment she caught sight of him, she turned to leave. But Daniel grabbed her wrist and pulled her into a quiet hallway.

He pinned her against the wall, hands braced on either side of her, caging her in. His breath was warm against her ear as he spoke. 

""You've been skipping school and not answering my messages. You didn't even say a word about our anniversary. Elizabeth, do you have any idea how worried I've been?""

Chapter 3
Daniel's eyes locked onto Elizabeth, his frustration over her disappearance simmering just beneath the surface.

Elizabeth pressed her lips together before forcing herself to meet his gaze. ""Mr. Woolridge, I didn't realize you could get so worked up over a meaningless hookup.""

The sudden sharpness in her tone, so unlike the obedient, quiet Elizabeth he was used to, caught him off guard.

Something defiant flashed in his eyes. In one swift motion, he yanked her closer, wrapping his arms around her waist in a possessive grip.

""A hookup? One time in two years, and you're calling that a hookup?"" he scoffed.

Elizabeth had no idea what had gotten into him. Before she could react, he grabbed her chin and leaned in like he was about to kiss her.

Just then, a voice interrupted them.

""Daniel, so this is where you ran off to. Cheryl's looking for you.""

Daniel frowned and loosened his hold on her. Turning to the man, he said, ""Got it. I'm on my way.""

Elizabeth tilted her head, feigning surprise. ""You know my sister?""

""Know her? Their relationship is a lot more interesting than you think,"" the guy said with a smirk. ""Brace yourself, Elizabeth. You're in for a shock.""

As the two of them walked away, a flicker of sarcasm passed through Elizabeth's eyes.

They operated under the smug assumption of her ignorance, confident that their orchestrated display of degradation would reduce her to pieces for their evening's entertainment.

What they didn't know was that she'd already pulled herself together, and she was more than ready to cut Daniel out of her life for good.

As the banquet reached its peak, the lights suddenly went out.

Moments later, a spotlight flared to life, illuminating the stage. Daniel appeared in a sleek black suit, escorting Cheryl, who was dressed in a stunning white gown, to the center of the room.

Samson beamed as he raised a hand to quiet the crowd. Then he spoke loudly and clearly, ""Thank you all for coming tonight. 

""We're here not only to welcome Cheryl back from her studies abroad, but also to share some exciting news. 

""The Fisher and Woolridge families have been close for generations. Years ago, we arranged an engagement between Cheryl and Daniel. 

""Now that they've fallen in love, we'll be holding their engagement party at the end of the month. We hope you'll all join us to witness their happiness!""

As soon as Samson finished, Daniel's friends turned to Elizabeth, clearly waiting for her to break down.

But Elizabeth stood quietly and calmly in the crowd as if what was happening on stage had absolutely nothing to do with her.

Daniel frowned. This was the moment Elizabeth was supposed to lose control, to crumble. But instead, she was unnaturally composed. A strange irritation bubbled up inside him.

Cheryl, noticing the shift in his energy, leaned in and asked, ""Dan, what's wrong?""

Daniel quickly looked away from Elizabeth and replied smoothly, ""Nothing. Just spaced out for a second.""

But he knew better. Elizabeth had loved him. There was no way she felt nothing.

She was just putting on a brave face.

…

Elizabeth splashed cold water on her face in the bathroom, scrubbing hard.

Thinking back to how desperately she'd clung to Daniel, she felt nothing but disgust for herself.

No wonder he'd only touched her that one time in two whole years. It wasn't because he cherished her. It was because she simply wasn't worth touching.

And the night she had treasured—her first time—meant nothing to him. It was simply the perfect weapon to ruin her life completely.

When Elizabeth returned to the banquet hall, Samson called her over. ""Elizabeth, come say hello to your future brother-in-law.""

She walked up to Daniel with a perfectly measured smile. ""Hello, Daniel, my brother-in-law.""

The word hit him hard, and his expression darkened instantly.

Cheryl, completely oblivious, beamed. ""Lizzy, I just heard Dan's a board member at your school. What a small world! If you ever run into trouble, just ask him for help. We're family now, after all.""

Elizabeth clenched her jaw. ""I won't be bothering Daniel.""

She didn't even look at him, but she could feel his stare—icy and sharp, like a blade pressed to her skin.

After a few more polite exchanges, Elizabeth was about to excuse herself, but Cheryl looped an arm through hers with exaggerated warmth.

""It's been so long since we talked, Lizzy. I've got so much to catch up on with you.""

Before Elizabeth could respond, Cheryl dragged her into the lounge.

The moment the door shut behind them, Cheryl dropped the sweet act. Her smile vanished, replaced by a cold, cutting look.

""Elizabeth, I heard you slept with Daniel, and now the video's everywhere. Did you really think cheap, disgusting tricks like that would make him fall for you? 

""Let me spell it out for you—he doesn't like you. In fact, he can't stand you. You know those rumors about your mom being a homewrecker? I told him to spread them. 

""And about him chasing you? That was my idea. I wanted to watch you fall for him, bit by bit—just so he could be the one to destroy you.""
Chapter 4
Elizabeth asked quietly, ""Why?""

""Why? Because you don't know your place. Your mother's been dead for years, and you're still clinging to everything that belongs to the Fisher family. 

""All of it should've been mine. You're the daughter of a mistress—what right do you have to enjoy the luxury and status that should've been mine?"" Cheryl scoffed.

Elizabeth could tolerate a lot, but not when someone dragged her mother through the mud.

She stormed up to Cheryl, her voice shaking with fury, every word forced through gritted teeth. 

""My mother wasn't a mistress. She married my father without even knowing you or your mom existed. It was you two who drove her to her death.""

Cheryl hadn't expected Elizabeth to talk back. Her expression twisted in rage as she raised her hand to slap her.

Just then, the lounge door burst open.

From the corner of her eye, Cheryl spotted Daniel walking in and instantly switched tactics. Thinking fast, she grabbed a handful of mixed nuts from the table and shoved them into her mouth.

A second later, she collapsed to the floor, slurring her words dramatically through a mouthful of food. ""Elizabeth… why would you make me eat that? You know I'm allergic to nuts…""

Daniel rushed to her side without hesitation, shoving Elizabeth aside.

She stumbled back, hitting the edge of a nearby coffee table.

A porcelain cup shattered on the floor. Shards of glass tore into Elizabeth's palms, leaving her hands bloodied, but Daniel didn't even glance her way.

He was already kneeling beside Cheryl, wrapping her in his arms. ""Cheryl, are you okay?""

Tears welled in Cheryl's eyes as she clung weakly to his arm.

""I just wanted to catch up with Lizzy… I don't know what I said wrong. She suddenly forced me to eat those snacks… Look at me, Daniel. Am I breaking out in hives?""

Daniel looked down, and sure enough, angry red welts were rapidly blooming across Cheryl's skin.

""What do I do? The banquet isn't even over yet; I don't want to embarrass you in front of everyone. Makeup—right, I can cover it with makeup!""

Daniel gripped Cheryl's wrist tightly, his expression darkening. ""You're breaking out in hives and still worried about crap like that? Enough. I'm taking you to the hospital.""

He scooped Cheryl into his arms. Just before leaving, he shot Elizabeth a cold, scathing look.

Elizabeth forced herself to stand. Pain surged through her body with every movement. Blood poured freely from her hands, soaking her dress in seconds.

But she couldn't feel it. It was as if she'd fallen into a bottomless pit, and every ounce of sensation had drained from her body.

She called over a waiter and asked for a first aid kit, then silently tended to her wounds, her fingers trembling the entire time.

By the time she was done, her body was drained, her mind foggy. She dragged her feet toward the exit, too exhausted to think.

As soon as she stepped into the hallway, several figures lunged out of the shadows. Before she could react, they grabbed her and dragged her into a nearby storage room.

A rough hand clamped around her jaw, forcing her head up. 

The next second, a burning liquid was poured straight into her mouth—pepper spray in liquid form, sharp and overwhelming.

Elizabeth's eyes flew open in horror.

Like Cheryl, she had a severe allergy, specifically to chili peppers. This much concentrated pepper could kill her.

""Mmff… stop…"" 

Elizabeth tried to fight back, but they didn't give her a chance. Cup after cup was forced down her throat—one after another.

She choked violently, her face flushed deep red as her body convulsed. Her wounded hands clawed weakly at the floor, the scraping sound raw and desperate.

The attackers didn't stop. If anything, her suffering only excited them further.

""Cheryl is Daniel's everything, and you dared lay a hand on her? Do you even know your place?""

""Heard you got bullied a lot at school. You probably got passed around by half the guys there. Do you think someone like Daniel—so proud and picky—would ever want a used-up whore like you?""

""Drink up, slut. Consider it your apology to Cheryl, or things are gonna get a lot worse for you.""

Elizabeth's vision blurred, her mind slipping further and further away.

With the last ounce of strength she had left, she whispered a name—barely audible. ""Dan…""

That was all she managed before cruel laughter exploded around her.

""Hah! You're still hoping Daniel's gonna come save you?""

""He's the one who told us to do this. You hurt Cheryl; he wants you dead!""

""Hey, let's rip her dress off and send him the pictures. Let Daniel blow off some steam, too!""

They swarmed her. In seconds, they tore her dress to shreds.

Then came the camera flashes, shot after shot of Elizabeth's battered, half-conscious body. Until finally, her strength gave out completely, and everything went black.

Chapter 5
When Elizabeth woke up, she was lying in a hospital bed.

Daniel sat beside her, working on his laptop. As if sensing her stir, he looked up and met her gaze.

The moment their eyes met, he let out the faintest sigh of relief, but his voice remained cold and sharp. 

""How does it feel to be on the receiving end for once? Take this as a lesson. Don't mess with Cheryl again.""

Elizabeth turned her face away without a word. A single tear slid quietly down her cheek.

She used to see Daniel as her salvation. But now, after what he'd done to her… how was he any different from the people who used to bully her?

Daniel watched her in silence. For a moment, something strange stirred in his chest.

She was the one who'd gone after Cheryl out of jealousy. After everything she'd done, she deserved this.

So why did he feel guilty when he saw her cry?

Just then, a young nurse opened the door. ""Mr. Woolridge, the air conditioner in Ms. Cheryl's room just went out…""

Daniel frowned. ""Then fix it. Why are you telling me?""

""We've already called maintenance, but they won't be here for another hour. Ms. Cheryl keeps saying she's cold, and unfortunately, there aren't any spare rooms available…""

The second he heard that, Daniel stood up. ""What kind of hospital takes an hour to fix an air conditioner?"" 

His brows drew tight. ""Cheryl's always had a weak constitution. She can't handle the cold. Move Elizabeth and let Cheryl have her room instead.""

The nurse hesitated, glancing uneasily at Elizabeth lying in the bed.

Elizabeth had a severe allergy to chili peppers. After being force-fed so much of it, the fact that she was still alive was a miracle.

But the damage was done. Her esophagus and stomach lining were badly burned. Even the slightest irritation could put her in danger all over again.

Meanwhile, Cheryl had only eaten a single bite of a nut-filled dessert. A few allergy shots and she was already on the mend. 

And yet, everything Elizabeth had suffered didn't seem to matter at all to Daniel.

""What are you waiting for? If Cheryl catches a cold in this dump, your entire hospital's going under,"" he snapped.

The message was clear. The nurse had no choice but to obey.

Soon enough, Elizabeth was moved to Cheryl's vacated room.

Daniel stayed with Cheryl. Elizabeth was left alone, lying in the oversized hospital bed, staring at the ceiling in a daze.

As the memories of everything she'd endured replayed in her mind, the dam finally broke. Tears spilled silently down her cheeks.

Then came the cold. A deep, creeping chill wrapped around her like a shroud.

She glanced toward the source and froze. The air conditioner was on, blasting icy air at full power.

In that instant, it all clicked.

Cheryl had lied about the air conditioner being broken. It wasn't about escaping the cold—it was about creating it.

She wanted Elizabeth to move here—to remain sick, weak, freezing. It was just another twisted form of revenge.

The temperature kept dropping. The air sliced into her skin like invisible knives. She trembled so hard her teeth chattered.

She tried to call for help, but her throat was too swollen. No sound came out.

She reached for the call button, but her arm was too weak. It barely lifted an inch before falling limply back to the bed.

Elizabeth curled into herself, clinging to whatever warmth she had left. She felt completely hopeless. 

She didn't know how long she lay there—abandoned, freezing, and slowly slipping away—before someone finally came.

When she forced her swollen eyes open, the face that greeted her wasn't one of concern. It was Cheryl, standing at her bedside, smirking with sick amusement.

""Elizabeth, look at you. You're pathetic. You look like a stray dog,"" she sneered. ""Daniel did all this just to help me vent. By now, everyone would have seen your pictures—they're passing them around for laughs. 

""Oh, and guess what? Some adult film companies reached out earlier. Said you'd be perfect for the lead in their next shoot. Isn't that hilarious?

Cheryl laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world.

Then, just as suddenly, her smile vanished. She grabbed Elizabeth's arm, right where the wounds were worst, and dug her fingers in.

Blood spurted instantly. Elizabeth's vision blackened from the pain.

""Now, do you finally understand who he loves? Be smart. Admit your mom was a homewrecker and disappear. I don't ever want to see your disgusting face again. You make me sick,"" Cheryl hissed.

The light in Elizabeth's eyes dimmed, fading into a hollow, lifeless emptiness.

Disappear?

She would.
