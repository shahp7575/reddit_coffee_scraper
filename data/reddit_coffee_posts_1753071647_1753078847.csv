1m5bdm6,https://i.redd.it/mtb61uq876ef1.jpeg,[Tool] How do you track small daily wins? I built a simple tap counter to help me stay consistent.,"Lately I‚Äôve been trying to stay more consistent with small habits ‚Äî like getting up every hour, staying off social media, or tracking water intake ‚Äî and felt that most apps were too complex for what I needed.

So I ended up building a super simple **Clicker Counter** app for iOS. Just tap to count ‚Äî no ads, no signup, no extra noise.

I use it for:

* Logging focus sessions
* Counting workouts or sets
* Tracking screen-free breaks
* Anything repetitive I want to stay mindful of

Would love to hear how you all track little wins or stay consistent with daily routines ‚Äî any creative tricks or tools?

Here‚Äôs the app if anyone‚Äôs curious:

1m5bbfd,https://i.redd.it/q42go2mh66ef1.png,Abandoned Wife Rebirth To Slap Faces,"1.Chapter 1 Caught Red-Handed

""So this is why you want a divorce?"" Louis Rathbone's voice cut through the room, sharp and pissed.



Georgia Murray jolted awake, her head spinning. Just one day after she'd dropped the divorce bomb, Louis had caught her in bed with another guy.



She never thought her husband, who barely noticed her, would be standing there, fuming.



In a flash, she felt like a stranger in her own life. The word slipped out, ""Divorce.""



Her heart sank, a sharp pain twisting inside. He still didn't trust her.



""Louis, I didn't‚Äî"" she stammered.



He cut her off, his lips curling into a sneer. ""Georgia, you wanted out. And I'm not blind, babe.""



Before she could respond, her cousin Cora Murray, now the big-shot VP of Murray Group, jumped in, all fake concern.



""Louis, don't be too hard on her. She's just lonely 'cause you're always working‚Ä¶"" Cora reached for his arm, but his assistant, Daniel Moreton, blocked her like a bouncer.



""Call the lawyer. Get the divorce papers ready,"" Louis snapped, turning to leave like Georgia's presence made him sick.



Georgia lunged for his arm but stopped short, his usual coldness flashing in her mind.



Instead, she grabbed his suit sleeve, her voice shaking. ""Louis, just listen to me‚Ä¶""



Three years. Three years she'd tried to warm this man's heart. Yesterday, after waking up from a brutal accident, she'd finally had enough and asked for a divorce. But even now, one look from him could freeze her solid.



Louis glanced at her hand on his sleeve, his eyes ice-cold. ""Get off me.""



With a sharp flick, he shoved her back.



Thud.



Georgia's head smashed into the coffee table, blood trickling from the gash.



Louis didn't even flinch. He ripped off his suit jacket‚Äîthe one she'd touched‚Äîand tossed it on the floor like it was garbage.



The move stabbed her heart. Three years, and she'd never cried.



Now, tears spilled over. A bitter laugh broke through her sobs.



""Louis,"" she whispered, ""did you ever love me? Even for a second?""



He half-turned, his gaze dripping with scorn. ""Don't play innocent. You know how you conned your way into my bed three years ago.""



His eyes flicked to the guy on the bed. ""Georgia, you're pathetic.""



With that, he stormed out.



Georgia crumpled, the pain in her head nothing compared to her shattered heart.



Tears streamed down as she closed her eyes, drowning in despair.



Eight years. Five years of chasing him, three years of marriage. For Louis, she'd ditched her dreams, her career, her dad. She'd been kicked out of Murray Group, stripped of her pride‚Äîall for him. Now, it felt like a cruel joke.



She laughed through her tears, a broken, hollow sound.



Turning to the guy lounging on the bed, smirking like a jerk, she spat, ""Samuel, why? You know nothing happened. Why didn't you say anything?""



Samuel Maxwell shrugged, pulling on his shirt with a cocky grin. ""Just wanted to see you smile, sweetheart.""



He slung his jacket over his shoulder and strolled out.



Before Georgia could process it, Daphne Liddon, the Liddon family's spoiled heiress, burst in with a crew of burly guys.



""You think you can steal my fianc√©?"" she shrieked. ""Beat her down!""



At Daphne's command, the goons pounced. Georgia, still dazed, didn't stand a chance. Fists and kicks rained down, leaving her sprawled, battered, and helpless.



Daphne smirked, pulling out her phone to record.



""Break her arm,"" she ordered, eyes glinting with malice. ""Let's see if this tramp tries it again.""



One thug stomped on Georgia's wrist. A sickening crack echoed, and pain seared through her, nearly making her black out.



Daphne glanced at Cora, who stood to the side, and with a nod, she and her crew bolted.



Every inch of Georgia's body screamed, her broken wrist the worst of it. But her heart hurt more.



Cora, in sky-high heels studded with rhinestones, sauntered over.



""You okay, sis?"" she asked, her voice syrupy.



Georgia looked up, tears blurring her vision. ""Cora, I didn't cheat‚Ä¶ You believe me, right?""



Cora's red lips twisted into a cruel smirk. ""Oh, I believe you.""



Georgia's heart leapt, a flicker of hope sparking. But Cora's next words crushed it.



""'Cause I'm the one who drugged you and dumped you in Samuel's bed,"" she said.



Georgia's head snapped up, shock and betrayal written all over her face.



Cora leaned down, tilting Georgia's chin with the tip of her heel, her eyes gleaming with triumph. ""This look suits you, sis. Feeling hopeless yet?""



""Why?"" Georgia's voice broke. ""What did I do to you?""



Cora's face hardened, venom in her tone. ""You were in my way. I should've been running Murray Group. I've got the brains, the hustle. But Grandpa picked you.""



Georgia froze. She'd been named heir years ago, but to marry Louis, she'd given it up and got kicked out.



""All this‚Ä¶ over a nomination?"" Georgia whispered.



Cora's eyes flashed with glee. ""I hated you for it. I was better, but you got the spotlight. Lucky for me, you were dumb enough to toss it all for a guy. Now I'm running Murray Group. Those genius plans that turned it around? Yours. And I took the credit.""



She laughed, cold and victorious. ""Oh, and your dad? Two years ago, I got him demoted to janitor. He's been scrubbing toilets, taking everyone's crap‚Äîbecause of you.""



Georgia's blood ran cold. Her dad, the kind man she adored, reduced to that? She had no idea.



Georgia's blood ran cold. Her dad, the kind man she adored, reduced to that? She had no idea.



She dragged herself up, ready to lunge at Cora, to fight with everything she had left.



2.Chapter 2 Fueled By Vengeance

Crack!



Cora's hand struck Georgia's face, sending her crashing to the floor.



Georgia lay there, broken like a tossed-out doll, as Cora's rhinestone-studded heel dug into her cheek.



Cora's smirk was pure poison. ""Georgia, don't blame anyone but yourself. You were just too damn dumb. Think I'm the only one who's got it in for you? Think again.



""You really believe Samuel screwed you over for kicks? And Daphne‚Äîthink she snapped your arm in a random rage?""



Cora's voice dripped venom. ""Oh, and that miscarriage at seven months? You bought that Louis 'tripped' and pushed you down the stairs? Nope. You stole her spot.""



She leaned in, words sharp as knives. ""And your mom? You think she died because you stressed her out? Three years ago, she caught Gemma spiking your drink and tried to play hero. Bad move.



""I knocked her out cold. Gemma shot her up with some mystery junk, and‚Äîpoof‚Äîtwo days later, she was gone.""



Georgia's nails clawed into her palms, blood seeping as Cora's truths gutted her.



For three years, she'd drowned in guilt over her mom's death, thinking her in-laws' cruelty was her mom's ghost getting even.



But it was all lies. The mastermind? Gemma Kirkland.



All because Georgia married Louis and took the ""Mrs. Rathbone"" crown Gemma wanted. They'd teamed up to drag her straight to hell.



Georgia screamed, raw and ragged, her fury breaking free.



""What's that? Wanna make us pay?"" Cora scoffed, lifting her heel off Georgia's face.



She sank into a chair, wiping her shoe with a tissue like she'd stepped in crap. ""You? A pathetic, washed-up nobody? You've got no shot.



""I could crush you like a roach. Your life's headed for the gutter, where trash like you belongs.""



She flicked the dirty tissue onto Georgia's face and strutted off, heels clicking like a taunt.



At the door, she tossed back, ""Oh, Gemma says check your phone.""



As Cora's footsteps faded, Georgia's phone pinged.



It read: \[How's it feel, Georgia? Everyone's turned on you. Your man hates you. Sucks, huh?\]



Staring at the text, Georgia didn't budge. Her sanity was shredding, rage swallowing her whole.



Samuel, Daphne‚Äîthey were just Gemma's pawns. Her entire tragedy was Gemma's sick revenge.



She didn't know how long she lay there, shattered. Eventually, she crawled up. Her eyes, once soft and warm, were now ice-cold‚Äîlike her naive heart had been ripped out, bleeding raw.



Rain drizzled as Georgia staggered to the Rathbone Group tower.



The receptionist, snotty as ever, didn't let her get a word in. ""Security! Toss this trash out! Who lets riffraff in here? Call the cleaners‚Äîthis place is gross now.""



Georgia ignored the jabs. Pale as a ghost, she slid a folder across the desk. ""Give this divorce agreement to Louis. Thanks.""



Time to ditch this pathetic excuse for a marriage.



The receptionist gawked as Georgia turned away. Something about her frail, rain-soaked frame screamed rebirth‚Äîlike a phoenix rising from ashes.



Outside, the drizzle turned into a downpour. Georgia dialed a number she hadn't touched in three years but knew by heart. It picked up on the first ring.



""You little brat! Thought you'd ghosted your old man forever!"" Her dad's voice was warm, no trace of bitterness despite their three-year silence. ""It's pouring‚Äîwhere you at? I'm coming for you.""



Tears blended with the rain, invisible on her face. ""It's a damn monsoon, Dad. How you gonna get me?""



She choked back a sob, gave her address, keeping it light.



""Trust me. I'll roll up on my magic carpet for my girl!"" her dad replied.



The rain hammered down, and through the blur, she saw him‚Äîa middle-aged guy in foggy glasses, drenched in a cheap raincoat, pedaling a rickety tricycle.



He looked rough but still had that gentle spark. Spotting her, he yanked off his raincoat and threw it over her.



""You dummy, standing in the rain? Getting dumber every day,"" he teased, hoisting her onto the bicycle.



He adjusted his soaked glasses and grinned. ""Check out my sweet ride, kid. Backseat VIP, hang on‚Äîyour driver's ready to roll!""



He pedaled hard into the storm.



Georgia stared at her dad's back, aged way too fast. He didn't mention his struggles, but she knew.



Three years ago, her stubborn choice to marry Louis had cost him everything. She'd looked it up earlier, and the truth hit like a punch to the gut.



Her marriage had tanked Murray Group. Rathbone Group, Louis's family empire, cut all ties with them.



The corporate world was a shark tank‚Äîonce Rathbone turned on Murray Group, others piled on. Her dad, crushed, was forced out as CEO.



Her uncle Victor Murray took over, and with Cora's fake ""sisterly"" act, conning Georgia for strategies, they'd turned Murray Group around. Everyone forgot her dad, the guy who built it from scratch.



Pain twisted Georgia's chest. Rain or tears? She couldn't tell. She'd been so wrong.



For three years, she'd groveled at Louis's family's feet, tossing her pride away. Meanwhile, Victor and Cora, with Gemma pulling the strings, had driven her dad into the dirt.



No more. She was done being selfish. Those who'd hurt her and her family‚Äîthey'd pay. Big time.



3.Chapter 3 Old Job

Vance Murray cruised through Journ City's roughest slums on his rickety bike, pulling up in front of a rundown shack.



He sighed, his eyes tracing the familiar, grimy street.



""This is where your mom and I started, kid,"" he said, voice heavy with nostalgia. ""After she passed, I kept thinking about those days‚Äîjust us, scraping by. So, I moved back.""



A shadow of pain flickered in Vance's eyes, but he hid it, turning to mess with a stack of beat-up cardboard boxes so Georgia wouldn't see.



Georgia eyed the shabby house, swallowing her bitterness.



She flashed her dad a warm grin. ""Love this place, Dad.""



Later, peeking into the nearly empty fridge, she spun around. ""I'm cooking tonight, Dad. Bet you're craving Mom's veggie noodle soup.""



Vance frowned, waving her off. ""No way, kiddo. Your wrist's in a cast‚Äîhow're you gonna manage?""



Georgia smirked. ""Don't sleep on your girl.""



She ducked into the tiny kitchen, shutting the door. Leaning against it, tears spilled down her cheeks.



Two years ago, Louis pushed her, seven months pregnant, down a staircase. She lost the baby and broke her arm.



After two days in the hospital, her mother-in-law forced her to cook and clean for the family, injuries be damned. Back then, the pain was worse than now.



One truth hit hard: only her parents truly cared.



Outside, Vance stared at the closed door, his heart aching. His once-fiery daughter was now tough as nails. 'How much has she suffered to get this way?'



Soon, Georgia set a steaming plate of veggie noodle soup in front of him, grinning. ""Dig in, Dad. Tell me it's not Mom-level good.""



The dish looked and smelled amazing. Vance's chest swelled with pride and pain. ""Alright, alright,"" he chuckled, grabbing fork and diving in.



\*\*\*\*\*



The next morning, after crashing on the sagging couch, Vance poked his head out of the kitchen and tapped Georgia's door.



""Hey, sweetheart, I'm off to work. Porridge is in there‚Äîeat something, yeah?"" he said.



In her room, Georgia stared at her phone. She'd spent all night online, where news of her ""cheating"" and divorce from the Rathbone family was blowing up, trending at number one. The comments were brutal, pure venom.



She killed her Wi-Fi and dialed a number she hadn't touched in three years.



""Georgia? You kept my digits?"" Lila Dutton's voice was warm, teasing.



""Lila, I'm getting my old job back,"" Georgia said, dead serious.



""Whoa, what?"" Lila sounded stunned. ""You got blackballed from medicine three years ago.



""With your arm jacked up and the internet roasting you, coming back's gonna be rough.""



""Plus,"" Lila added, ""you're no slouch. You've got business smarts. I could bankroll you‚Äîstart something new, make bank.""



Why? Georgia gripped her phone tighter. Her biggest enemy was a hotshot on the medical elite list.



""Lila, you know me. I don't stay down. I'm coming back where I fell. Help me out,"" she said.



Lila sighed, remembering how Georgia, the youngest doc back then, had spotted her talent as a struggling nurse and got her promoted. That faith made Lila who she was.



Gritting her teeth, Lila said, ""Okay, I'll make some calls. But don't get your hopes up.""",1,1753078558.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

# Best Grocery cart Cup Holder 2025: Reviews & Guide

The grocery cart cup holder is a seemingly small, yet incredibly useful accessory for anyone who frequents the grocery store. Juggling a coffee, water bottle, or even a smoothie while navigating crowded aisles and managing a shopping cart can be a recipe for spills and frustration. A reliable cup holder solves this problem, providing a secure and convenient place to store your beverage while you shop. In 2025, the market offers a variety of options, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. This guide will help you navigate these choices and find the best cup holder to meet your specific needs.

[[Explore Top Rated grocery cart cup holder on Amazon.]](https://site.rediys.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=grocery cart cup holder)

## Key Features analysis

The best grocery cart cup holders share several common characteristics, but they also differentiate themselves in terms of design features and materials. Understanding these details is crucial for making an informed purchase.

**Attachment Mechanism**

The attachment mechanism is arguably the most notable feature. A secure and stable attachment ensures that the cup holder stays firmly in place, even when the cart hits bumps or when you're navigating tight corners. Some models use robust clamps with adjustable screws, while others utilize Velcro straps or spring-loaded clips. Clamps provide a more permanent and secure fit, while straps and clips offer greater versatility and ease of installation. Consider the type of cart handle you typically encounter and choose a mechanism that is compatible and provides a snug fit.

**Cup Holder Size and Adjustability**

The size and adjustability of the cup holder itself are critical for accommodating different beverage containers. A versatile cup holder should be able to accommodate everything from small coffee cups to larger water bottles and even travel mugs. Some models feature adjustable arms or inserts that can be modified to fit different diameters. Look for a cup holder that specifies the maximum diameter it can hold, and ensure that it meets your typical needs. The depth of the holder should also be sufficient to prevent tall beverages from tipping over.

**Material and Durability**

The material used in the construction of the cup holder significantly impacts its durability and lifespan.Plastic is a common choice due to its affordability and resistance to water damage. However,higher-quality plastics,such as ABS or polypropylene,are more resistant to impacts and cracking. Metal cup holders, typically made from stainless steel or aluminum, offer superior durability and a more premium feel. Consider the expected usage and environment when choosing a material. If you frequently shop in harsh weather conditions, a more durable material is recommended.

**Additional Storage Features**

Some cup holders go beyond simply holding beverages and offer additional storage features. These might include small compartments for storing your phone, keys, wallet, or shopping list.These additions can be incredibly convenient, allowing you to keep essential items within easy reach while you shop. However, be mindful of the added bulk and weight, and ensure that these features don't compromise the primary function of holding your beverage securely. The placement of these compartments is also important ‚Äì they should be easily accessible without interfering with your beverage.

**Ease of Cleaning**

Spills are unavoidable, so a cup holder that is easy to clean is a must. Look for models with smooth, non-porous surfaces that can be easily wiped down with a damp cloth. Some cup holders are even dishwasher-safe, which simplifies the cleaning process even further. Avoid models with intricate designs or hard-to-reach crevices, as these can be difficult to clean and may harbor bacteria.A removable liner or insert can also make cleaning much easier.

Key features of the best grocery cart cup holders in 2025 includes:

* Secure Attachment Mechanism
* Adjustable Cup Holder Size
* Durable Material
* Additional Storage Features
* Easy to Clean Design

## Core Benefits

A well-designed grocery cart cup holder offers several practical benefits that can significantly enhance the shopping experience.

**Improved Convenience:** A cup holder eliminates the need to juggle your beverage while pushing the cart, freeing up your hands to grab groceries, check your shopping list, or manage your children. This simple convenience can make a big difference in reducing stress and frustration during your shopping trips. It also means you no longer need to awkwardly try balancing drink containers in your shopping cart which frees up space for groceries.

**Reduced Spills and Accidents:** By providing a secure and stable place for your beverage, a cup holder minimizes the risk of spills and accidents. This protects your clothes, your groceries, and the cart itself from unnecessary messes. No more worrying about a sudden turn or bump causing your coffee to splash all over your items; this also reduces the chances of you having to do extra clean-up work.

**Enhanced Association:** For models with additional storage features, a cup holder can help you keep essential items organized and within easy reach.This eliminates the need to fumble through your purse or pockets to find your phone, keys, or wallet. You'll have everything you need right at your fingertips, making your shopping trip more efficient and enjoyable.

**Increased focus and Safety:** By eliminating the need to manage a beverage, a cup holder allows you to focus more on your surroundings and on the task at hand. This can improve your overall safety, especially in crowded stores or parking lots where you need to be aware of your surroundings. Keeping your focus on the shopping experience and other people in the area keeps everyone safe from any unnecessary accidents.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about grocery cart cup holders:

**What types of grocery carts are these cup holders compatible with?**

Most grocery cart cup holders are designed to be compatible with a wide range of standard grocery cart handles. However, it's always a good idea to check the product specifications to ensure that the attachment mechanism is suitable for your typical cart. Some models may not be compatible with carts that have unusually shaped or sized handles. Consider whether the attachment mechanism is universal and can fit many types of handle sizes.

**Are these cup holders easy to install and remove?**

The installation and removal process varies depending on the type of cup holder. Models with clamps or screws typically require a bit more effort to install but offer a more secure fit. Models with velcro straps or spring-loaded clips are generally easier to install and remove, making them a convenient option for those who want to switch the cup holder between different carts or vehicles. Having a simple installation and removal method can come in handy when storing the cup holder for long periods of time.

**what is the typical weight capacity of a grocery cart cup holder?**

The weight capacity of a grocery cart cup holder typically ranges from 1 to 3 pounds. This is generally sufficient for holding most standard beverage containers. However, it's important to avoid overloading the cup holder with excessively heavy items, as this could compromise its stability or damage the attachment mechanism. Always check the manufacturer's specifications for the maximum weight capacity. Keeping an eye on the weight capacity ensures that your cup holder functions properly and lasts for a long time.

**Why This Pick?**

Given that the last 4 straight encounters between these two squads cashed the Over with ease, I‚Äôm willing to bet the same happens here (for a couple of reasons‚Ä¶). Blue Jays starter Kevin Gausman‚Äôs (4.19 ERA) last outing against the Yankees saw a final total of 17 runs (Toronto claimed the victory), but Gausman has allowed 18 hits over his last 3 outings, and has been relatively shaky for the first half of this season.

I have a small coffee shop with 2 employees. The shop opened at the beginning of July. I am using FreeAgent and bank with Mettle. I am trying to set up Payroll and have followed the guidance to add employees but can't seem to find the options as per the guidance.

Anyway, I am now dealing with a bereavement and worried I have not been able to set up Payroll and that I will not be able to pay my staff on time.

Can I send them a direct bank transfer of their wages based on the hours they have worked and then run the payroll stuff next month and backdate any tax/NI deductions and give them a payslip next month that covers July and August?

my boyfriend and I had a terrible fight really late tonight. I was cleaning up the couch and living room right before we were going to bed and what I thought was cat fur ended up being a stain from the pizza we had for dinner. I was really annoyed cause it‚Äôs a brand new couch and it cost us a lot of money (we aren‚Äôt rich, we just work really hard). I‚Äôm almost 100% sure it wasn‚Äôt from me as I ate with a plate and ate leaning overtop of the coffee table. I told him there was pizza sauce on the couch and acted pretty annoyed by it. I definitely insinuated it was most likely him, but I never blamed him and said ‚Äúyou did this‚Äù. I get really anxious over stuff like this because the couch is new and I don‚Äôt like when things are messy or dirty (he‚Äôs aware of this about me). Is it an overreaction? probably. does it stem from growing up extremely poor and never having nice things and now working hard to give myself a nice life? very much so. 

so we are doing everything to get these stains out (it‚Äôs 1am at this point) and I‚Äôm getting more anxious as it won‚Äôt come out. He doesn‚Äôt seem as bothered which is fine, but it‚Äôs important to me so I just say I‚Äôll keep trying to get it out it‚Äôs fine. 

He gets upset saying I blamed him and that it could have been me. I said I never once said this was your fault, you did this etc, but that it most likely wasn‚Äôt me because of how I ate. He then said he also ate like that (he didn‚Äôt) and that it could have been either one of us. for arguments sake, I just said sure we don‚Äôt know for sure who it was but I‚Äôm still upset the stain is there. he‚Äôs getting more annoyed and is calling me ridiculous and saying it doesn‚Äôt matter etc and I‚Äôm like well it matters to me, stop being so dismissive just because it‚Äôs something that doesn‚Äôt matter to you and calling me and my feelings ridiculous. I reminded him that working hard to make a nice house for us and myself is important because I grew up basically homeless (hopping from one place to another, often losing our belongings in the process, living with other family etc). and that this is why these types of things are important to me now as an adult. 

we are both getting heated and mad now and he said to me ‚Äúyou always say you aren‚Äôt materialistic and yet you‚Äôre getting upset over a couch‚Äù which I thought was a really shit thing to say. I explained that I‚Äôm not materialistic in the sense that I care about expensive things as a status symbol or expensive gifts, just things that have meaning and to me this couch has meaning because of my past. he kept telling me that he will pay me back my portion for the couch and that the couch can just be his so we don‚Äôt run into this problem and I said no, I want the couch to be ours, we live together. He kept telling me how ridiculous I was being over a stain and a couch and I was really upset about how he was treating the whole thing and me. 

I started yelling and I *never* yell, because honestly, it wasn‚Äôt about the couch anymore, it‚Äôs how dismissive he was being about my feelings when I specifically explained why it is important to me and that he always get dismissive of my feelings if it‚Äôs not something he cares about. I got really heated and told him I was leaving and went to grab the door to leave and was shaking because I was so upset how he just couldn‚Äôt try to even see the WHY in this whole thing from my perspective and gaslit me about how it may have been me who made the spill and was so dismissive just because it‚Äôs something that doesn‚Äôt bother him. 

He got really quiet and said he wanted me to leave him alone and said I freaked out over something so small. While I agree it stemmed from something small, it was his dismissive reaction and lack of even trying to listen to me, that made me feel so unheard and crazy trying to explain my feelings that made me blow up. I tried to explain this but I really just don‚Äôt think he sees it that way at all. 

I understand I overreacted and I did apologize for yelling and indirectly putting the blame on him. I don‚Äôt feel great about yelling or having something really small blow up. I just wanted to feel heard and not crazy for my feelings, even if to most people something like this wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal. There‚Äôs a lot of things that built up to why this is important to me and I just wanted him to understand and acknowledge that, and keep the fact that he thought it was ridiculous to himself. 

I‚Äôm not really sure where to go from here. We aren‚Äôt sleeping in the same room right now (this was already happening as we are keeping our cats separate while we introduce them, so we sleep with our own cats). and he told me to wake him up still tomorrow to drive me to work. but I‚Äôm not really sure how to apologize or what I should do to make this better. Not really looking for advice about how I reacted or the situation, more just how to move forward together.

I just wanna know if we managed to balance our work life with happiness and maybe, hopefully, found love in a new corner of our life. Idk, at times I question if this change would genuinely lead us to who we hoped to become, or if I simply chickened out because the unknown is daunting.

Don't forget the person you were back then, because I'm really counting on you to learn from all these feelings I've bundled up. Keep your heart open and ready for adventure. I hope you're proud of where life took us and, whatever path you chose, you embraced it wholeheartedly.

We met again, went for ramen and then went to the mall for ice cream, it was a fun time. At the end of the date we kissed. We saw each other again the next evening, went to the bar and had a couple of drinks. I walked her to her bike and tried insinuate that she could come to my place or me to hers. She said no because i have homework to do, i was like ' it's Saturday evening and it's 11pm, there's no homework going on at this time lol' But still she said she had to do it. We kissed again and i went back home alone. We keep chatting almost everyday on IG. We had a 4th date and went for jogging together, then mall & food again, it was fun. But this time there was little physical interaction from her, so i didn't push of course. Now there are a few things that bother me :  
\- she doesn't seem to have that physical attraction towards me. It's the first time in my life i have to go on 4 dates and still don't go further with a girl  
\- i pay for every date, all the food etc... She doesn't say thank you or offer to pay  
\- she changed her Tinder profile pic to a sexier pic of her than before and i see her IG followers count getting higher  
\- she changed her IG highlights and a couple of stories are her in g-string panties  
\- still every morning she texts me ""good morning"" and we keep chatting about our mutual days.

So... i kinda feel i'm being a fool but at the same time we have nice times together, she even invited me to spend the whole weekend with her next week, so.. I don't know what i should do

I booked for a clay modelling workshop for me and my friends and then when we reached the venue they had nothing there.

Of the three events they had posted about on district, they were doing only one a very small table for two people, the rest of the venue was occupied fully by regular cafe goers. The one organiser who was there laughed in our face and called his superviser and was laughing because we had already booked the tickets for the workshop. None of them are replying or taking accountability or offering a refund for this. This was held at Conscious Coffee Cravings in HKV. They have just gotten away with taking people's hard earned money. There were other people just arriving as we had given up and left the venue because we realised how badly we had been scammed.

Now they won't even give me a refund. I've reached out to district, to Small World's instagram, even reached out to the numbers that the organisers gave me. Please don't fall for this new scam. You think you'll have a fun workshop with friends but it's all a SCAM.

So a few days ago I came home from work like any normal day and I did the dishes and folded clothes and cleaned the house for my wife as I seen it hasn‚Äôt been done and assumed my wife had a hard day as she is a stay at home mother of our son and her step daughter my actual daughter that goes to her moms every other weekend as I have primary care of my daughter. So I came home from work and my wife told me she had to go to the gas station which was a little annoying as my wife knew I just went into the bathroom to go to the bathroom. I didn‚Äôt say anything because again I assumed she had a bad day so I just said ok. The normal gas station my wife goes to is only 5 minutes from the house. 
     
   So I‚Äôm rushing to go to the bathroom at this point it‚Äôs been 10 to 15 minutes now and I heard a loud bang. So I assumed it was my wife coming home as she‚Äôs a person the slams doors. Well 30 seconds goes by and my daughter comes upstairs and says her brother fell over so I rush to wipe my ass due to me drinking coffee all day and I had the shits. To I rush to wipe my ass admittedly it wasn‚Äôt that good but I was to concerned about my son so I go down stairs and my wife is nowhere to be found. My son is in his height chair on his side so I rush to make sure he‚Äôs ok which thank god he was. 
        
    It just scared it which is understandable so I cleaned him up and he was happy and went running around the house creating chaos like normal. Well when my wife came home I was pretty angry as I didn‚Äôt know he was eating and I looked on find my iPhone and she was 20 minutes away at another gas station which the whole trip all together was 55 minutes which is incredibly way to long especially when she said listen for the kids. Kids in my eyes should never be unsupervised for that long. To clarify my kids were not unsupervised for 55 minutes that‚Äôs just how long my wife was gone for.    
      
  So when she came I she didn‚Äôt come inside she went straight into our garage and stayed in there so I went out there and told her next time she goes out that far she needs to let me know as the kids can‚Äôt being roaming the house that long. I did have an attitude but can‚Äôt blame me I just did everything she should have done since she was home all day plus more such as work leave work early to help her dad cut up a 60ft tree split wood and made myself dinner and take care of the kids and laundry and dishes I didn‚Äôt even have time to go wash my ass as I had to stop mid poop to go help my son. So I tell her that and she gets pissed off immediately and remember I only said with an attitude next time you go that far you need to let me know as the kids can‚Äôt be by themselves that long and she tells me I‚Äôm not doing this with you and proceeds to make me seem crazy so I tell her I am taking a shower before the kids. I did not tell her why due to me not seeing the point in telling her as she was already pissing me off. 

So she tells me then you can give the kids a bath and put them to sleep. So I told her that she didn‚Äôt do anything all day but talk shit with her friend that lives in a different state and sit on her ass and watch children. So she goes off and at this point I was over it as I had a long day and didn‚Äôt want todo this with her so I went inside to look for my socks so I can put my slides on and go on a drive. Well while I was looking in hamper of clothes I just folded not to long ago I see my wife out of the window taking my sons car seat out so I assumed at that point so was going to tell me to go sleep at my moms or something like that as there was no point in taking my sons car seat out. So I decided to pick up the hamper and put it in the truck as she went to the front of the house with my son‚Äôs car seat. Well when I get into the trunk my keys aren‚Äôt in there so I see my wife and she‚Äôs hiding my keys in her shirt so I take them out and walk as fast as I can to the trunk to avoid her as I know she‚Äôs about to blow up. 

   Well as soon as I open the truck door and start it she jumps in and tells me where are we going so I tell her IM GOING TO MY MOMS because at this point I see where it‚Äôs going so she tried to take the hamper out of my truck and I hold the hamper and grab her arm to let go of the hamper and she lets go and grabs my keys out of the ignition and opens her door and throws them so at this point I jump out and I am running full sprint around my trunk to get my keys before she gets them. Well she beats me and then proceeded to throw them 65 feet away into my neighbor‚Äôs drive way. Mind you I was still running when I watched my keys fly over the roof of my trunk and hear the keys hit my neighbor drive was so I had to dodge my patios post that hold up the roof and my trunks mirror and she turns right into me as I was still running full sprint and obviously that wasn‚Äôt a good idea as she went flying and by the time I stopped I was already in my neighbor driveway and once I processed what happened I ran down and my wife ran into the trunk locking the doors again to keep me from leaving. So I tell her I‚Äôm not trying to leave I‚Äôm worried about her and asked if she‚Äôs ok and she opens the door and tells me to leave and that we are getting a divorce and that I‚Äôve gone crazy. 

 So I try to get MY daughter as my wife has no legal rights to her and she tells me I hit her and that if I take my daughter she will call the cops so obviously not wanting to subject my daughter to that whole situation I just said fine and tried to check on her again as I was still concerned about her and she told me to get away or she‚Äôs going to punch me in the face and then goes into my truck takes my daughter car seat out and throws the hamper of clean clothes all over the lawn so I get them pick them all up and go to my moms. Now she‚Äôs going around telling people I‚Äôve gone crazy and that I hit her and pushed her and that I‚Äôve never paid any attention to what she wants and she told me she‚Äôs trying to grow and I‚Äôm holding her back. Am I in the wrong? Am I going crazy? Or is this whole situation blown up over her feelings? Mind she when I got home she was drinking and I talked to her today and she was home alone with our son and she told me she had 2 n a half shots and a beers that had maybe 5 sips so could this be something more serious?

So a few days ago I came home from work like any normal day and I did the dishes and folded clothes and cleaned the house for my wife as I seen it hasn‚Äôt been done and assumed my wife had a hard day as she is a stay at home mother of our son and her step daughter my actual daughter that goes to her moms every other weekend as I have primary care of my daughter. So I came home from work and my wife told me she had to go to the gas station which was a little annoying as my wife knew I just went into the bathroom to go to the bathroom. I didn‚Äôt say anything because again I assumed she had a bad day so I just said ok. The normal gas station my wife goes to is only 5 minutes from the house. So I‚Äôm rushing to go to the bathroom at this point it‚Äôs been 10 to 15 minutes now and I heard a loud bang. So I assumed it was my wife coming home as she‚Äôs a person the slams doors. Well 30 seconds goes by and my daughter comes upstairs and says her brother fell over so I rush to wipe my ass due to me drinking coffee all day and I had the shits. To I rush to wipe my ass admittedly it wasn‚Äôt that good but I was to concerned about my son so I go down stairs and my wife is nowhere to be found. My son is in his height chair on his side so I rush to make sure he‚Äôs ok which thank god he was. It just scared it which is understandable so I cleaned him up and he was happy and went running around the house creating chaos like normal.

I grew up in a neglectful household. Our DCP caseworker became friends with my mum. We visited her home. They smoked and had coffee together. They still talk to this day. The reports written about us were severely downplayed, and I believe that relationship is the reason my siblings and I weren‚Äôt removed when we clearly should have been.

I‚Äôve seen other cases, worse than mine, where children have died because caseworkers didn‚Äôt do their jobs properly‚Äîor lacked proper oversight.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm petitioning for a change: all DCP home visits should be conducted in rotating pairs‚Äîtwo workers, not just one, and they shouldn‚Äôt always be the same duo. This would reduce bias, increase accountability, and protect children from grooming, manipulation, or mishandling.

Force Factor Test X180 Gummies: End The Coffee-Cup Cookie Cycle‚ÄîProbiotic Yogurt & Omega Hacks,"**Fenugreek Vs. Force Factor Test X180 Gummies: End The Coffee-Cup Cookie Cycle‚ÄîProbiotic Yogurt & Omega Hacks**

The debate surrounding natural supplements and dietary enhancements often circles around effective options like Fenugreek and items like Force Factor Test X180 Gummies. Both proponents argue for their benefits in boosting vitality and enhancing overall health, but which one reigns supreme?

Fenugreek is a plant-based supplement widely recognized for its hormone-balancing properties. Known for its ability to support metabolic health, it has gained traction among those seeking to improve their wellness naturally. Its high fiber content aids digestion and can contribute to weight management. For those trapped in the coffee-cup cookie cycle, Fenugreek serves as an excellent alternative, providing an energy boost without the inevitable sugar crash.

On the other hand, Force Factor Test X180 Gummies present a blend of vitamins and minerals designed to promote enhanced testosterone levels, supporting muscle growth and improved stamina. These tasty gummies are particularly appealing for those looking to combine convenience with nutritional benefits. They help combat the sluggishness that often accompanies sugary snacks, making them a strategic choice for those striving to transcend unhealthy snacking habits.

Integrating probiotic yogurt into your diet can further amplify the effects of both Fenugreek and X180 Gummies. Probiotics are vital for a healthy gut microbiome, potentially improving digestion and nutrient absorption, which can help mitigate the negative repercussions of the sugary indulgences that often accompany coffee breaks. Don't overlook omega-3 hacks; incorporating sources like chia seeds or flaxseeds can boost brain function and reduce inflammation, complementing the efforts in balancing diet and lifestyle.

Ultimately, whether you choose Fenugreek for its holistic benefits or opt for Force Factor Test X180 Gummies for convenient muscle support, aligning these supplements with probiotic yogurt and omega-3 fatty acids can create a robust strategy against unhealthy eating patterns. Breaking the coffee-cup cookie cycle requires a multifaceted approach, and these elements blend seamlessly for a health-conscious lifestyle.

Just a simple thank-you.
To Reddit.
To the devs, the mods, the strangers.. all of you.

Two months ago, after being on this platform for over 6 years, I finally posted something personal.
It was about my first love, when I was 12.

I didn‚Äôt expect anything, but someone asked me to message her.
They said they wanted to talk.
I reached out.
And just like that, something started.

We became friends.
She connected with me during one of the lowest points of my life.
I had just lost 5 years of work, trust, and all mental stability I had left.
But she stayed. Tried to understand.
And more importantly she helped me see the opposite gender differently.

For years, I‚Äôd been carrying silent trauma.
As a child, I was s.e and bullied by older girls in school ,tuition & various places.
I never told anyone. I just kept living with it.

Before Reddit, I used to panic during romantic scenes in movies.
Even a random touch in public transport would give me fever or trigger panic.

But she changed something in me.
She didn‚Äôt even know how much.
If I could, I‚Äôd gift her a Hershey‚Äôs coffee, some earrings, and a handwritten thank-you letter. (Atleast what i figured out she likes)

Because she helped something bloom inside me something I thought was dead. 
I messed things up sometimes.
Blocked, unblocked. Pulled away.
But it was never about her it was what I was carrying.

Also strangers here very helpful, they advised , they helped, they understood me. 

In these two months, I‚Äôve met many people here.
Some beautiful souls.
Some people who needed help and I was there.
I listened to a few very weird girls too their traumas, their stories and gave my time, support, care.
But when I asked for time or space, they pulled away.
No explanation. Just vanished. Yeah.

Some brothers I helped too helped them heal, listened to them when they had no one.

And through all this I also found genuine friends.
People who stood by me.
Checked in on me.
Talked to me like I mattered.

This place changed me.
Massively.

I‚Äôve had panic attacks.
I lost 7 kg.
Had no appetite. Stayed up all night. Took sleep meds just to keep functioning.

Now?
Those meds lie untouched on my table.
I cry less.
I feel more in control.

I still have a long way to go but I‚Äôm stronger.

Reddit helped me reconnect with people.
It gave me the courage to speak.
It gave me space to breathe.

I lost my all connections.
Made new ones.
And became stronger, in more ways than I ever expected.

So thank you.
To Reddit.
To that friend.
To the weird ones who left, and the strong ones who stayed.
To the strangers who replied, and the ones who just read silently.

Thank you for helping me become myself again.
Not the broken version.
But the one who‚Äôs still fighting and finally healing.

Initially, I thought side tables would be a space-saving solution for my small apartment. They seemed practical - just enough room for drinks and remotes. But after living with just side tables for a few months, I realized I was missing out on the functionality a proper coffee table provides.

The main issue was the limited surface area. When friends came over, we had nowhere to put snacks, board games, or multiple drinks. Side tables are great for individual seating spots, but they don't create that communal space that a coffee table naturally provides.

I spent hours researching different coffee table options (you can check out some great choices here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables) and learned that modern coffee tables come in various sizes and styles that can work even in compact spaces.

Here's what I discovered about the coffee table vs. side table debate:

Benefits of Coffee Tables:
- Creates a focal point in your living room
- Provides ample surface area for entertaining
- Offers storage solutions (many have drawers or shelves)
- Helps define your seating arrangement
- Perfect for displaying decorative items

When Side Tables Work Better:
- In very tight spaces where every inch counts
- For minimal living room use
- When you prefer a more open floor plan
- In rooms with unconventional layouts

After much consideration, I ended up getting a lift-top coffee table that provides storage and can double as a work surface. If you're interested in exploring different coffee table options, I found a great selection here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

My honest recommendation? Don't skip the coffee table unless you absolutely have to. The functionality it adds to your living space is worth the investment. However, if you do go with just side tables, make sure to get ones with enough surface area and consider adding a few ottoman-style pieces that can work as backup tables when needed.

Bottom line: While side tables are great companions to your seating arrangement, they shouldn't be your only surface solution in a living room. A coffee table brings both practical and aesthetic value that's hard to replace with alternatives.",1,1753076375.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1m5amh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1m5amh3/islam_is_the_ultimate_mindwarp/,Islam is the ultimate mind-warp,"It would take months to describe this properly but I‚Äôll keep it short.

I know that people often place the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) in the same category, but as a former Muslim (now atheist) who studied the OT and NT to do ‚Äúdawah‚Äù for Islam, I genuinely believe that Islam is in a league of its own.

It takes up an INSANE amount of cognitive overhead. There are so many entities and spiritual powers at hand (all mythical to an atheist, but just so you understand):

1) Jinn, sentient beings made from smokeless fire (nar al sumum), the lore takes up entire libraries. They are able to travel between dimensions, teleport, influence thoughts, cause physical disturbances, etc. 

Muslims believe that Jinn/Djinn are more intelligent than their carbon-based human counterparts, and that they have their own variety of tribal, national, monarchical, etc structures in their own dimension. 

The Jinn also have religions and cultures. There are atheist Jinn, Muslim Jinn, Jewish Jinn, Christian Jinn, Hindu Jinn etc.

‚ÄúHauntings‚Äù as Christians see them, are caused by demons. In Islam, shayateen (demons) are a subset of jinn (essentially malicious jinn), who choose to disobey god and torment certain human beings. Satan, in Islam, is a fallen jinn, for example, who functions almost the same as the Christian version (he engages in waswas = whispers to misguide/cause humans to sin).

Jinn can see you, but you can‚Äôt see them. They exist in their own dimension, but also in our realm simultaneously. This was mental torture, and many, many of our childhood trauma stories emerged from this belief. Doors slamming, weird sounds? Jinn would immediately come to mind

2) Ayn/Evil Eye/Hasad (envy): In Islam, this is a metaphysical force. If someone does not mention the name of God on your new property/achievement/newborn/literally anything, they could intentionally or unintentionally strike it with ‚Äúevil eye‚Äù, which would bring it to ruin. So if ‚ÄúMa Sha Allah‚Äù (God willed it / What God Wills), or ‚ÄúAllahuma Barik‚Äù (May God Bless (it/you)) is not mentioned on that item or achievement, you have a probability of losing it. 

This is often blamed for a house burning down, or a job not generating sufficient income, or a laptop not functioning properly. Even knocking over a mug of coffee on your new MacBook can be seen as the result of your cousin envying you for it. Again, severe cognitive/mental overhead.

3) Sihr/Magic/La‚Äônat/Curses: This is where Christianity and Islam intersect.

Anything can be cursed: you, objects (toys, dolls, clothes, whatever), homes, etc.

A lock of hair, a picture, or a piece of fabric can be used to enact it.

Similar to how the Puritans of Salem persecuted witches, the Caliphs of Islam (depending on the time period) punished those accused of witchcraft severely.

4) Another Islamic-Christian intersection: Satan

Somehow, Shaytan/Satan is seen as simultaneously weak yet omnipresent (except during the month of Ramadan, as he‚Äôs locked up for 30 days and can‚Äôt influence your thoughts and actions).

During the rest of the hear, Satan can cause people to sin, give you negative thoughts, turn you away from Allah, and cause you to doubt God‚Äôs will.

5) A metaphysical veil between the believers and the disbelievers. Not only that, but according to the Quran, ‚Äúthe Jews and Christians will not be pleased with you until you follow their creed.‚Äù 

This creates a mental barrier in the devout Muslim‚Äôs mind due to the belief that the Christians and Jews around you are divinely destined to NEVER truly approve of you until you become one of them.

There are many more examples of insane metaphysical elements at play, but yeah, this religion is a struggle.. a world of its own.

Sometimes I think death isn‚Äôt an end, but a silence. A pause. A stillness I‚Äôve never been allowed to feel. Because my mind doesn‚Äôt¬†stop.¬†It‚Äôs been running since I can remember ‚Äîobsessing, analyzing, catastrophizing, dreaming, falling apart quietly in the background while I go through the motions of a life that doesn‚Äôt feel like mine. Suicidal thoughts don‚Äôt always show up as breakdowns or notes or goodbyes. Sometimes they look like long showers where you imagine fading into the drain. Sometimes they look like putting off brushing your teeth for the third day in a row because what‚Äôs the point of hygiene in a life you don‚Äôt want to stay in? Sometimes it‚Äôs not even despair ‚Äî it‚Äôs pure boredom. Emptiness. That surreal floaty feeling where your body is here but your mind keeps slipping out the sides. And I don‚Äôt talk about it. Not out loud. Not to people. But I‚Äôve said it in¬†voice notes ‚Äî the archive of me that no one else will ever hear. Over¬†1400 recordings¬†of thoughts I didn‚Äôt know what to do with. They range from 20-minute rambles to hour-long collapses, and they‚Äôre the only thing I‚Äôve consistently kept up with ‚Äîbecause when no one listens, the act of hearing yourself is sometimes all that keeps you from disappearing completely. I‚Äôve spent the last few years of my life not living, but¬†recording, capturing, archiving, storing pieces of myself in those voice notes, not just to remember events/ideas, but to¬†prove¬†I existed at all, to keep a trace of myself when the silence became too loud and the idea of talking to someone felt more terrifying than talking to nothing. There‚Äôs a strange comfort in speaking when no one is listening, in spilling your insides into a microphone knowing it won‚Äôt interrupt, won‚Äôt advise, won‚Äôt misunderstand you or try to fix you or tell you you‚Äôre being dramatic or emotional or too much. I speak to myself because if I don't, it gets loud. Too loud.

I spend too much time thinking and living/dwelling in imaginary scenarios: so relentlessly, so uncontrollably, that it has stopped being a gift and started to feel like a curse. I don‚Äôt know how to turn it off. I don‚Äôt know how to stop seeing¬†beneath¬†everything: beneath words, beneath faces, beneath systems, beneath thinking itself (yep, I tend to engage into meta-thinking), until I‚Äôve dug so far into a thought that there‚Äôs nothing left but dust and echoes and doubt. 

I‚Äôve gone through stages of mind that don‚Äôt have chapters or recovery arcs. I‚Äôve experienced the whole absurdity of existence, where the pointlessness of everything became almost comical, where I‚Äôd laugh alone in my room at the contradictions of life ‚Äî the rituals, the systems, the beliefs people cling to ‚Äî and feel both godlike and lost, as if I‚Äôd hacked into a cosmic joke and still didn‚Äôt know how to laugh at it properly. And then, deeper than that, I fell into nihilism (this view started developing when I began researching determinism) ‚Äî not the aesthetic kind, not the clich√© one, not the version with black and white filters and Nietzsche quotes, but the pure version, the kind that sits like a void behind every action, the kind that makes even beauty feel like a temporary distraction from nothingness. There were months when I believed in absolutely nothing ‚Äî not love, not truth, not purpose, not even pain ‚Äî and yet, paradoxically, I felt everything. I would lie awake at 4 a.m. dissecting my thoughts until they became so fragile they collapsed under their own logic, and I‚Äôd sit there staring at the ceiling, wondering how I could be so full of insight and so empty of will. This paralysis that comes with self-awareness: the more you understand the world, the less you feel able to move in it. Because every action starts to feel artificial. Every goal feels fabricated. Every social rule feels ridiculously faulty, as It was designed by people who were just as confused as I am, pretending they weren‚Äôt. And yet, through all this chaos, I still believe in values (?), though maybe ""believe"" isn‚Äôt the right word, but I‚Äôll proceed with that. I believe in¬†complexity. In the kind of thought that makes people uncomfortable. In the kind of emotion that cracks through numbness like sunlight through frost. I believe in¬†the value of ‚Äútruth‚Äù (whatever this concept means), even when it‚Äôs brutal, even when it isolates me. I value¬†freedom, not the capitalist version where you get to choose your coffee order, but the real kind ‚Äî freedom of thought, of movement, of identity, of living in ways that diminish most of the societies‚Äô constructs. I‚Äôve always been drawn to the facets and edges of things ‚Äî to ideas that exist between categories, to people who don‚Äôt belong, to systems that unravel if you press on them hard enough. I‚Äôm not interested in easy answers. I don‚Äôt want comfort. I want to be disturbed. I want to be shaken. I want to¬†feel¬†something that can‚Äôt be explained away in a tweet or a headline or a psychology textbook. I crave intensity. I crave meaning. And I hate that I crave it, because this world isn‚Äôt built to offer that kind of nourishment without a price. Everything intense and worthwhile comes with a cost. Everything real feels like a threat in a world of ignorance. I think that‚Äôs why I struggle so much. Because I can‚Äôt¬†pretend. I can‚Äôt perform normalcy. I can‚Äôt feign interest in small talk or fake urgency for goals I don‚Äôt believe in. I move through the world like a foreign object, trying to mirror enough human behavior to pass as functional, but inside I feel like I‚Äôm watching it all from behind a glass wall ‚Äî close enough to touch, but never really in it. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm numbed. Paralysed. Both physically and emotionally. There‚Äôs a kind of tiredness that comes from carrying so much inside you, from having thoughts so dense they begin to collapse under their own gravity, and you become a black hole of potential, of momentum, of pain, of ideas that never made it out into action. I‚Äôve spent years trying to fix this. Started deconstructing my personality years ago. Several years ago, I realised I‚Äôm neurodivergent. A combination of ADHD and mild autism. Top that off with 3 years of chronic depression and a relatively ambiverted personality that uncontrollably shifts between craving human connection and total isolation ‚Äî and you get quite a puzzling mix. I feel like I‚Äôm under a constant, persistent state of superposition. 

Regarding neurodivergence/depression: while I recognize these terms, while I see how they fit, how they map to my behavioural patterns ‚Äî I don‚Äôt wear them like a name tag. I don‚Äôt let them become the architecture of who I am. These ‚Äúconditions‚Äù don‚Äôt explain the texture of my thoughts or the way I ache when I see injustice or how I get stuck inside sentences or how the ticking of a clock can make me feel like I‚Äôm being skinned alive by time. 

Oh, and the paralysis. Executive dysfunction. I‚Äôve tried the systems. The journaling. Various advice. Consistent change/substitution of behavioral patterns. The reframes. But none of it works when the core issue isn‚Äôt a lack of ideas to go off or the destructive habits ‚Äî it‚Äôs a war between ten contradictory selves, all pulling in different directions, none of them strong enough to win, but all too stubborn to decapitate. I‚Äôm stuck. I don‚Äôt know where to start off, which direction to take, with what sequence of actions to start. Tried improvising, but it only led me to confusion and self-destruction. 

I contradict myself constantly. I crave deep connection and disappear when people get close. I dream of being understood but don‚Äôt know how to let anyone close enough to do it. Primarily because most people seem a bit too simplistic and ignorant about many facets of life. Perhaps that‚Äôs a projection of who I am (?), since it feels like we tend to attract individuals similar to ourselves (again, not always). Even if it‚Äôs not a projection, maybe that‚Äôs what I need? Simplicity? Hmm, in the retrospect ‚Äî fuck simplicity. Not everywhere, of course. Simplicity is a useful tool when you know exactly what you want to do, and you just need to execute it with enough rapidity and precision. Or whilst solving problems ‚Äî considering the most simplistic answer(s) drastically helps, especially during the process of elimination. Anyway, coming back to contradictions: I talk about my ideas like I‚Äôm trying to save the world, then lie on the floor unable to reply to a text. I romanticize freedom, then bind myself in mental prisons of my own design. I see too far ahead to ever relax, and yet I stay frozen in place, as if waiting for permission to begin a life I already hate. 

Regarding recent events: ended a 1.5 year relationship when I found out she fell in love with someone else. She was the first individual I truly loved. Even more than myself. I knew that my girlfriend‚Äôs bisexual, and I did have a hunch that it might be a bit complicated to navigate all of this, but I was certain it wouldn‚Äôt end this way. I don‚Äôt blame her for developing feelings for someone else ‚Äî what I‚Äôm confused about is why she hadn‚Äôt told me about it earlier or why she didn‚Äôt even try to fight for this relationship‚Ä¶ Most likely she wasn‚Äôt sure about her feelings towards this person, the whole situation became a blur, and then she decided to go off intuition‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always felt this quiet shame for being a man (well, a male teenager, a boy (?) technically, since I‚Äôm still 19). I hate being a male, honestly. Not even because of this situation, it goes way deeper that that, but I guess it‚Äôs not something worth discussing at this moment. 

Regarding those trains of thoughts.. It feels like drowning in your own awareness, like watching reality unfold in high resolution while everyone else walks through a blur, and sometimes I envy their blur, because¬†clarity hurts¬†when you don‚Äôt have the tools to do anything with it (They say: ‚ÄúIgnorance is a bliss‚Äù. I agree and disagree at the same time). Well, thats on certain days. On other days, I don‚Äôt understand what the fuck is happening inside me, nor do I understand what‚Äôs happening outside my mind. Brain fog takes over, derealization intensifies, the will to live gradually fades away. Seems like all of this comes from inaction. It also seems like I crave perfection, and that‚Äôs what stops me from simply acting out towards my desires. Thing is, lately, I don‚Äôt have any desires at all. I just want to dissolve in the air and stop experiencing. Stop experiencing anything. It feels too overwhelming. The other part of me, though, constantly tells me to stop wining and start becoming. Developing. Moving. Moving somewhere, just not stagnating. Otherwise, I‚Äôll become a fossil. Have you ever seen a fulfilled, purposeful, and energetic fossil? Hm. Feels like I‚Äôm rambling a bit too much. 

I know that what I described is not particularly uncommon, but it doesn‚Äôt make it easier. Well, perhaps it does. At the very least, I hope someone reading this felt even for a second like they were seen, like something in them was named, like they could finally exhale and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not alone.‚Äù¬†And if that happened ‚Äî if even one person felt that, I think maybe that‚Äôs enough to go on for another day. 

If you have any insights/comments to share, feel free to do so :> 

By the way, If I do decide to end my life sometime soon, would you perhaps like to listen to all of those voice notes/read my text notes and some of my poetry? Where do you think I should upload everything? GitHub?

[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m3es4m/update_i_30f_took_off_my_engagement_ring_after_12/) **- 18th July 2025**



**I (30F) took off my engagement ring after 12 years with my fianc√© (30M) ‚Äî I think I‚Äôm done, but now he wants to change.**



I (30F) have been with my fianc√© (30M) for 12 years. We met in school, got engaged 2 years ago and have a 5-year-old daughter together.

He‚Äôs a kind man at heart, but he‚Äôs a workaholic. Over the past few years, he‚Äôs become more and more consumed by work, often staying up late, waking at 3am to work again, falling asleep on the sofa most nights. I‚Äôve asked for help repeatedly but nothing changes.

I work full-time, study in the evenings, exercise to manage stress, and I‚Äôm the default parent, every routine, every meltdown, every bedtime, every household task. He promises to help and then just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt.

Example: The other night he said he‚Äôd put our daughter to bed. At 9:30, I found him snoring while she watched cartoons on his phone after he gave her chocolate before bed. She was wired until 10:30PM and I had to take over again. Last night, I broke down crying. He asked if I wanted to talk. I said no. I was too exhausted to speak and he just went to sleep on the sofa again.

I came downstairs after studying, saw him still asleep (dishes not done like he promised he would do) and quietly took off my engagement ring and left it on the table.

This morning, I got a long message from him. He says he now truly sees the damage, that he‚Äôs been emotionally shut down from his own trauma, that he‚Äôs been in a dark place and taking me for granted. He says he‚Äôll go to therapy, change how he works, show up better, and is asking for 30 days to prove himself.

And now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm torn.

Part of me wants to believe him. It‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve wanted him to say, months ago. But another part of me feels like it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôve been holding it all together alone for too long. I‚Äôm tired, hurt, and honestly unsure if I even want to try anymore.

So Reddit, I need advice:

Can people really change after years of emotional absence?

Has anyone tried a ‚Äútrial period‚Äù like this? Did it help or just delay the inevitable?

How do I protect myself (and my daughter) emotionally if I do give him this time?

I‚Äôm not wearing the ring anymore. I haven‚Äôt promised anything. I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if there‚Äôs anything left worth saving or if I‚Äôve already outgrown this version of us.

Thanks for reading. Any insight or experience is deeply appreciated.

Edit / FAQ: Thanks for all the responses so far .I just wanted to answer a few common questions that keep coming up:

Does he work extra hours because we need the money? No. We could live off my salary alone. We have everything we need, a house with a low mortgage, no car payments, and no major debts. His extra hours don‚Äôt bring in extra pay (he‚Äôs salaried). He‚Äôs a project manager at a large corporate firm and is working toward yet another promotion. He‚Äôs a ‚Äúyes man‚Äù at work, always overextending himself even when it means logging on in the middle of the night. He says it‚Äôs for the family, but truthfully, it‚Äôs about career ambition and people-pleasing.

Have I helped him with his trauma? This is the first time he‚Äôs ever opened up about trauma. I knew his childhood was a bit rough, but for years he insisted it didn‚Äôt affect him. Now, suddenly, it‚Äôs being named as a reason for his emotional disconnection. I‚Äôm not minimizing it. I understand trauma is real but until now, it was completely buried and never talked about.

Have I brought this up before? Yes. Over and over. I‚Äôve told him clearly, calmly, even desperately, what I needed. He always says he‚Äôs ‚Äúhelping‚Äù by working so hard. And if he does the dishes or takes our daughter to bed once in a while, he wants a medal. He genuinely believes he‚Äôs doing enough because his intentions are good but good intentions don‚Äôt carry a household.

Context on my life/career: I work in a law firm (it‚Äôs often very stressful), and I‚Äôm currently sitting my FE1 exams which are the Irish equivalent of the Bar. I could have qualified years ago, but I kept putting my own career goals on the back burner to support his. Every time he needed flexibility, space, late nights I gave it. I don‚Äôt regret supporting him, but I do regret losing myself in the process.

*The most freeing thing I did was to leave the man who neglected my emotional needs over and over again. I was in the hospital for 10 days and he dropped me off and visited me once. But when his friend was in the same hospital, he went every single day. You‚Äôre modeling good behavior for your daughter.*  
*I am better alone.  He may step up aa a better parent after you leave (my ex did).  And bonus, now, my house is decorated exactly how I like it.*

**-garlic-thot-**

*When you get sick, people show you who they truly are. Sorry you went through that.*

**Aussiealterego**

*You told him, repeatedly, that you were unhappy. He didn‚Äôt take steps to change until it impacted HIS potential happiness/comfort. Leaving the ring on the table was you saying ‚ÄúToo late, I‚Äôm done ‚Äú. And now he promises change? Where was all this when you were begging for help? He doesn‚Äôt listen when you tell him there is a problem. Not until you make it his problem. Is this really the relationship you want? Because it‚Äôs the one you‚Äôve got.*

**Update - 1 day later**



Thanks to everyone who responded to my original post. Your advice and outside perspective really helped me see things clearly.

We were supposed to talk tonight, just one honest conversation to see if there was anything left to save. But he fell asleep putting our daughter to bed and never came down. No message. No effort.

That moment confirmed what I‚Äôve been feeling deep down for a while. I‚Äôve been holding this relationship together alone. Giving chances. Getting my hopes up and being let down every single time.

To be fair, over the past two days he did try. He was suddenly being the partner I‚Äôve been asking for. He cleaned without being asked, made me coffee (which he rarely did), and sent me long, apologetic texts. He acknowledged how much he‚Äôs hurt me and even told me he booked a therapy session for Monday.

But the truth is, I feel like it‚Äôs too late. It took me reaching my breaking point for him to react. And even now, when we finally had a chance to talk, he fell asleep again. He‚Äôll wake up in our daughter‚Äôs bed and find the message I sent, telling him that I‚Äôm done.

I don‚Äôt even want to speak to him at this point, though I know I‚Äôll have to for the sake of our daughter. I‚Äôm hurt, exhausted, and emotionally checked out. After 12 years together, and five of those raising a child, I‚Äôve hit a point where love has turned into resentment. I don‚Äôt recognise us anymore.

I know this won‚Äôt be easy. But I also know it‚Äôs necessary. I need peace. I need clarity and I need to stop trying to fix something that‚Äôs been broken for far too long.

Thank you again to everyone who helped me feel less alone in this. It meant more than you know.

tl;dr: Fianc√© and I (both 30) have been together for 12 years and have a 5-year-old daughter. He‚Äôs a kind man but a workaholic who‚Äôs been emotionally and practically absent for a long time. I reached my limit. He made a last-minute effort the past two days, cleaned, made coffee, booked therapy. But tonight, when we were meant to talk, he fell asleep again. I sent him a message ending it. I‚Äôm heartbroken but also at peace. I can‚Äôt carry this alone anymore.

*Spoiler alert:  He won‚Äôt change.*

**Blonde2468**

*I have had this happen also - they do everything you've ever asked of them when they know you are done. They think this helps. What they don't realize as it just PISSES US OFF EVEN MORE because now WE KNOW they knew what and how to do what we asked for all along, they just DID NOT CARE until we are walking out the door. TOO F*CKING LATE AH!!!\*

**4SeasonWahine**

*Exactly this. My ex wanted to make ALL the changes when he realised he‚Äôd lost me and it made it so much worse because I‚Äôd spent the last 2 years having HOURS of intense conversation over all the things that needed to change. I told him that making the changes to stop me leaving does nothing, that‚Äôs just manipulation. I needed him to make the changes because he wanted to keep the relationship in the first place.*

*No one wants to be with a person who's more motivated by their absence than their presence.*

Sometimes I think death isn‚Äôt an end, but a silence. A pause. A stillness I‚Äôve never been allowed to feel. Because my mind doesn‚Äôt¬†stop.¬†It‚Äôs been running since I can remember ‚Äîobsessing, analyzing, catastrophizing, dreaming, falling apart quietly in the background while I go through the motions of a life that doesn‚Äôt feel like mine. Suicidal thoughts don‚Äôt always show up as breakdowns or notes or goodbyes. Sometimes they look like long showers where you imagine fading into the drain. Sometimes they look like putting off brushing your teeth for the third day in a row because what‚Äôs the point of hygiene in a life you don‚Äôt want to stay in? Sometimes it‚Äôs not even despair ‚Äî it‚Äôs pure boredom. Emptiness. That surreal floaty feeling where your body is here but your mind keeps slipping out the sides. And I don‚Äôt talk about it. Not out loud. Not to people. But I‚Äôve said it in¬†voice notes ‚Äî the archive of me that no one else will ever hear. Over¬†1400 recordings¬†of thoughts I didn‚Äôt know what to do with. They range from 20-minute rambles to hour-long collapses, and they‚Äôre the only thing I‚Äôve consistently kept up with ‚Äîbecause when no one listens, the act of hearing yourself is sometimes all that keeps you from disappearing completely. I‚Äôve spent the last few years of my life not living, but¬†recording, capturing, archiving, storing pieces of myself in those voice notes, not just to remember events/ideas, but to¬†prove¬†I existed at all, to keep a trace of myself when the silence became too loud and the idea of talking to someone felt more terrifying than talking to nothing. There‚Äôs a strange comfort in speaking when no one is listening, in spilling your insides into a microphone knowing it won‚Äôt interrupt, won‚Äôt advise, won‚Äôt misunderstand you or try to fix you or tell you you‚Äôre being dramatic or emotional or too much. I speak to myself because if I don't, it gets loud. Too loud.

I spend too much time thinking and living/dwelling in imaginary scenarios: so relentlessly, so uncontrollably, that it has stopped being a gift and started to feel like a curse. I don‚Äôt know how to turn it off. I don‚Äôt know how to stop seeing¬†beneath¬†everything: beneath words, beneath faces, beneath systems, beneath thinking itself (yep, I tend to engage into meta-thinking), until I‚Äôve dug so far into a thought that there‚Äôs nothing left but dust and echoes and doubt. 

I‚Äôve gone through stages of mind that don‚Äôt have chapters or recovery arcs. I‚Äôve experienced the whole absurdity of existence, where the pointlessness of everything became almost comical, where I‚Äôd laugh alone in my room at the contradictions of life ‚Äî the rituals, the systems, the beliefs people cling to ‚Äî and feel both godlike and lost, as if I‚Äôd hacked into a cosmic joke and still didn‚Äôt know how to laugh at it properly. And then, deeper than that, I fell into nihilism (this view started developing when I began researching determinism) ‚Äî not the aesthetic kind, not the clich√© one, not the version with black and white filters and Nietzsche quotes, but the pure version, the kind that sits like a void behind every action, the kind that makes even beauty feel like a temporary distraction from nothingness. There were months when I believed in absolutely nothing ‚Äî not love, not truth, not purpose, not even pain ‚Äî and yet, paradoxically, I felt everything. I would lie awake at 4 a.m. dissecting my thoughts until they became so fragile they collapsed under their own logic, and I‚Äôd sit there staring at the ceiling, wondering how I could be so full of insight and so empty of will. This paralysis that comes with self-awareness: the more you understand the world, the less you feel able to move in it. Because every action starts to feel artificial. Every goal feels fabricated. Every social rule feels ridiculously faulty, as It was designed by people who were just as confused as I am, pretending they weren‚Äôt. And yet, through all this chaos, I still believe in values (?), though maybe ""believe"" isn‚Äôt the right word, but I‚Äôll proceed with that. I believe in¬†complexity. In the kind of thought that makes people uncomfortable. In the kind of emotion that cracks through numbness like sunlight through frost. I believe in¬†the value of ‚Äútruth‚Äù (whatever this concept means), even when it‚Äôs brutal, even when it isolates me. I value¬†freedom, not the capitalist version where you get to choose your coffee order, but the real kind ‚Äî freedom of thought, of movement, of identity, of living in ways that diminish most of the societies‚Äô constructs. I‚Äôve always been drawn to the facets and edges of things ‚Äî to ideas that exist between categories, to people who don‚Äôt belong, to systems that unravel if you press on them hard enough. I‚Äôm not interested in easy answers. I don‚Äôt want comfort. I want to be disturbed. I want to be shaken. I want to¬†feel¬†something that can‚Äôt be explained away in a tweet or a headline or a psychology textbook. I crave intensity. I crave meaning. And I hate that I crave it, because this world isn‚Äôt built to offer that kind of nourishment without a price. Everything intense and worthwhile comes with a cost. Everything real feels like a threat in a world of ignorance. I think that‚Äôs why I struggle so much. Because I can‚Äôt¬†pretend. I can‚Äôt perform normalcy. I can‚Äôt feign interest in small talk or fake urgency for goals I don‚Äôt believe in. I move through the world like a foreign object, trying to mirror enough human behavior to pass as functional, but inside I feel like I‚Äôm watching it all from behind a glass wall ‚Äî close enough to touch, but never really in it. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm numbed. Paralysed. Both physically and emotionally. There‚Äôs a kind of tiredness that comes from carrying so much inside you, from having thoughts so dense they begin to collapse under their own gravity, and you become a black hole of potential, of momentum, of pain, of ideas that never made it out into action. I‚Äôve spent years trying to fix this. Started deconstructing my personality years ago. Several years ago, I realised I‚Äôm neurodivergent. A combination of ADHD and mild autism. Top that off with 3 years of chronic depression and a relatively ambiverted personality that uncontrollably shifts between craving human connection and total isolation ‚Äî and you get quite a puzzling mix. I feel like I‚Äôm under a constant, persistent state of superposition. 

Regarding neurodivergence/depression: while I recognize these terms, while I see how they fit, how they map to my behavioural patterns ‚Äî I don‚Äôt wear them like a name tag. I don‚Äôt let them become the architecture of who I am. These ‚Äúconditions‚Äù don‚Äôt explain the texture of my thoughts or the way I ache when I see injustice or how I get stuck inside sentences or how the ticking of a clock can make me feel like I‚Äôm being skinned alive by time. 

Oh, and the paralysis. Executive dysfunction. I‚Äôve tried the systems. The journaling. Various advice. Consistent change/substitution of behavioral patterns. The reframes. But none of it works when the core issue isn‚Äôt a lack of ideas to go off or the destructive habits ‚Äî it‚Äôs a war between ten contradictory selves, all pulling in different directions, none of them strong enough to win, but all too stubborn to decapitate. I‚Äôm stuck. I don‚Äôt know where to start off, which direction to take, with what sequence of actions to start. Tried improvising, but it only led me to confusion and self-destruction. 

I contradict myself constantly. I crave deep connection and disappear when people get close. I dream of being understood but don‚Äôt know how to let anyone close enough to do it. Primarily because most people seem a bit too simplistic and ignorant about many facets of life. Perhaps that‚Äôs a projection of who I am (?), since it feels like we tend to attract individuals similar to ourselves (again, not always). Even if it‚Äôs not a projection, maybe that‚Äôs what I need? Simplicity? Hmm, in the retrospect ‚Äî fuck simplicity. Not everywhere, of course. Simplicity is a useful tool when you know exactly what you want to do, and you just need to execute it with enough rapidity and precision. Or whilst solving problems ‚Äî considering the most simplistic answer(s) drastically helps, especially during the process of elimination. Anyway, coming back to contradictions: I talk about my ideas like I‚Äôm trying to save the world, then lie on the floor unable to reply to a text. I romanticize freedom, then bind myself in mental prisons of my own design. I see too far ahead to ever relax, and yet I stay frozen in place, as if waiting for permission to begin a life I already hate. 

Regarding recent events: ended a 1.5 year relationship when I found out she fell in love with someone else. She was the first individual I truly loved. Even more than myself. I knew that my girlfriend‚Äôs bisexual, and I did have a hunch that it might be a bit complicated to navigate all of this, but I was certain it wouldn‚Äôt end this way. I don‚Äôt blame her for developing feelings for someone else ‚Äî what I‚Äôm confused about is why she hadn‚Äôt told me about it earlier or why she didn‚Äôt even try to fight for this relationship‚Ä¶ Most likely she wasn‚Äôt sure about her feelings towards this person, the whole situation became a blur, and then she decided to go off intuition‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always felt this quiet shame for being a man (well, a male teenager, a boy (?) technically, since I‚Äôm still 19). I hate being a male, honestly. Not even because of this situation, it goes way deeper that that, but I guess it‚Äôs not something worth discussing at this moment. 

Regarding those trains of thoughts.. It feels like drowning in your own awareness, like watching reality unfold in high resolution while everyone else walks through a blur, and sometimes I envy their blur, because¬†clarity hurts¬†when you don‚Äôt have the tools to do anything with it (They say: ‚ÄúIgnorance is a bliss‚Äù. I agree and disagree at the same time). Well, thats on certain days. On other days, I don‚Äôt understand what the fuck is happening inside me, nor do I understand what‚Äôs happening outside my mind. Brain fog takes over, derealization intensifies, the will to live gradually fades away. Seems like all of this comes from inaction. It also seems like I crave perfection, and that‚Äôs what stops me from simply acting out towards my desires. Thing is, lately, I don‚Äôt have any desires at all. I just want to dissolve in the air and stop experiencing. Stop experiencing anything. It feels too overwhelming. The other part of me, though, constantly tells me to stop wining and start becoming. Developing. Moving. Moving somewhere, just not stagnating. Otherwise, I‚Äôll become a fossil. Have you ever seen a fulfilled, purposeful, and energetic fossil? Hm. Feels like I‚Äôm rambling a bit too much. 

I know that what I described is not particularly uncommon, but it doesn‚Äôt make it easier. Well, perhaps it does. At the very least, I hope someone reading this felt even for a second like they were seen, like something in them was named, like they could finally exhale and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not alone.‚Äù¬†And if that happened ‚Äî if even one person felt that, I think maybe that‚Äôs enough to go on for another day. 

If you have any insights/comments to share, feel free to do so :> 

By the way, If I do decide to end my life sometime soon, would you perhaps like to listen to all of those voice notes/read my text notes and some of my poetry? Where do you think I should upload everything? GitHub?

# Best Keyboard Cover 2025: Protect Your Investment!

A Keyboard cover is an essential accessory for anyone who wants to protect their laptop or desktop keyboard from spills, dust, and other potential damage. In 2025, with laptops becoming even more integrated into our daily lives, these covers offer a simple and effective way to prolong the life of your device and maintain its cleanliness. With various materials, designs, and features available, choosing the right keyboard cover can seem daunting. This review will guide you through the best keyboard covers of 2025, helping you make an informed decision and protect your valuable investment.

## Key Features Analysis

The Keyboard cover market has evolved dramatically, offering a wide range of features tailored to different user needs. This analysis focuses on some of the most significant specifications found in top-performing models of 2025.

**Material Durability:**

The Quality of the material directly impacts the lifespan and protective capabilities of the Keyboard cover.High-end models in 2025 typically utilize either Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) or silicone.TPU offers superior durability and resistance to tearing, capable of withstanding significant wear and tear over extended use. Silicone, while more flexible and pleasant to type on, may degrade faster under similar conditions. The choice depends on the user's priorities ‚Äì long-lasting resilience versus comfortable tactile feedback.

**Precision Fit:**

A Critical factor determining the overall user experience is the precision of the Keyboard cover's fit to the specific keyboard model. Advanced manufacturing techniques enable the production of covers that perfectly match the contours and dimensions of various laptop brands and keyboard layouts. These precise fits prevent the cover from shifting during use, ensuring uninterrupted typing and consistent protection across all keys. Meticulous attention to detail in mapping keyboard layouts allows for an excellent fit.

**Thickness & Clarity:**

the Optimal balance between thickness and transparency is crucial. A thinner Keyboard cover provides a less intrusive typing experience, preserving the tactile feel of the keyboard keys. Simultaneously occurring, it may compromise the cover's ability to protect against significant spills or impacts. Conversely, a thicker cover offers more robust protection but reduces the tactile sensitivity during typing. Transparency plays a similar role, allowing keyboard backlighting to shine through unimpeded while maintaining clear visibility of the key legends. Many opt for a thickness range of 0.1mm-0.3mm.**Antimicrobial Properties:**

Considering hygiene is paramount, notably in shared workspaces. Some manufacturers now incorporate antimicrobial agents into the Keyboard cover material during production. These agents inhibit the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms on the surface of the cover,reducing the risk of cross-contamination and maintaining a cleaner environment. The antimicrobial effectiveness is typically verified through industry-standard testing protocols, guaranteeing long-lasting protection.**Washability & Maintenance:**

The Ability to easily and effectively clean the Keyboard cover is essential for maintaining hygiene and prolonging its lifespan. Top-rated models in 2025 are designed to be easily washable with mild soap and water, allowing users to remove accumulated dust, dirt, and other contaminants. The non-porous nature of TPU and silicone further simplifies the cleaning process, preventing liquids from being absorbed into the material and causing permanent stains or damage. Regular cleaning helps maintain the cover's transparency and antimicrobial properties, ensuring long-term performance.

Key features of the best keyboard covers in 2025 include:

   High-quality TPU or silicone construction
   Precisely molded to fit specific keyboard models
   Thin and clear design to minimize typing disruption
   Antimicrobial properties to inhibit bacterial growth
   Easy to wash and maintain

## Core Benefits

Keyboard covers provide a range of practical benefits that can significantly enhance the user experience and protect their investment.

**Spill Protection:** A Keyboard cover provides a barrier against accidental spills of liquids like water, coffee, or juice, which can cause irreparable damage to the internal components of a laptop or keyboard. The Cover creates a waterproof shield that prevents liquids from seeping into the delicate circuitry, short-circuiting the device, and voiding warranties.This enhanced protection means users can enjoy beverages near their computer without worrying about costly repairs or replacements.

**Dust and Crumb Prevention:** Over Time, dust, crumbs, and other debris can accumulate between the keys of a keyboard, creating unsanitary conditions and interfering with key functionality. A keyboard cover effectively seals the gaps between keys and prevents these particles from entering, mitigating the risk of key malfunctions and maintaining a cleaner workspace. This translates to more responsive and reliable keyboard performance over the long term, reducing the need for frequent cleanings or repairs.**Scratch and Wear Resistance:** The Constant use of a keyboard can lead to wear and tear on the keycaps, causing them to fade, become shiny, or even break.A keyboard cover acts as a protective layer that shields the keycaps from scratches, abrasions, and the gradual erosion caused by continuous finger contact. This extends the life of the keyboard and preserves its aesthetic appearance, helping to maintain the resale value of the device.

**Extended Keyboard Lifespan:** By Combating against spills, grime, and wear, a cover protects and increases the functional life of costly keyboards and laptops. This long term protection equates to long run savings for the consumer.
**Noise Reduction:** The sound from constant typing can get unnerving to the user or those around them. the cover assists in dulling loud typing noises.

## FAQs Section

Common questions related to keyboard covers and their usage.

**Will a keyboard cover impact my typing speed or accuracy?**

While some users may initially experience a slight adjustment period, high-quality keyboard covers are designed to minimize any impact on typing speed or accuracy. Thin and transparent covers made from materials like TPU offer a minimal tactile barrier, allowing users to maintain their natural typing rhythm and precision. Most users find that they quickly adapt to the presence of the cover and experience no significant difference in their typing performance.

**Are keyboard covers reusable, or do they need to be replaced regularly?**

Keyboard covers are generally reusable and can last for several months or even years with proper care and maintenance.The lifespan of a keyboard cover depends on factors such as the quality of the material, the intensity of use, and the frequency of cleaning. Regular cleaning with mild soap and water can help remove accumulated dust, dirt, and oils, extending the life of the cover and maintaining its hygiene. Replace the cover if it gets damaged.

**Can a keyboard cover cause overheating problems on my laptop?**

High-quality keyboard covers are designed to be breathable and minimize any potential impact on laptop thermals. While it is theoretically possible for a thick, non-porous cover to trap some heat, the effect is usually negligible under normal operating conditions. Ensure that the keyboard cover is properly fitted and does not obstruct any ventilation ports or cooling vents on the laptop. Overheating because of a keyboard cover is rare.

**Do keyboard covers come in different languages or keyboard layouts?**

Yes,keyboard covers are available in various languages and keyboard layouts to accommodate different regions and user preferences. Many manufacturers offer covers with printed characters, keyboard symbols in multiple languages, making them suitable for users who type in languages other than English. Ensure you purchase the correct layout for you specific needs when browsing availabilities.

Luna Lovette's POV

‚ÄúCongratulations Luna, you are one month pregnant,‚Äù my pack doctor, Pavel announced.

Joy laced his voice, but I still felt something off, even though those were the exact words I had been waiting to hear for a long time, and my joy knew no bounds.

Finally, I was going to have an heir and secure my position as the Luna without fearing anyone usurping my authority.

It was straightforward for an Alpha to rule a pack without a Luna, but the rule was not the same for a Luna without an Alpha. Though both species trained well, she-wolves were still considered to be weaker than the werewolves.

That was my reason for taking this path, my heart exploding with the kind of excitement that had me clutching the test result tightly to my chest as if someone was going to take it from me.

All I wanted was to share this news with my best friend and whoever cared to listen, especially those cunning elders. About to leave the Doctor‚Äôs office, my exciting moment was soon flipped by what the doctor said next.

‚ÄúBut there is a problem, Luna.‚Äù

It was just as I thought. His behavior was suspicious, and I could not put a finger on it, but no matter the problem, I just hoped it wouldn‚Äôt affect the pup I was carrying in my womb.

‚ÄúProblem? Is there anything wrong with my pup?‚Äù I hugged my still flat belly protectively, ready to strangle anyone who would dare to come close to hurting him or her.

The Goddess knew for how long I had wanted this, so how could I lose this child before he or she was born?

My heart tightened painfully at the thought.

‚ÄúThe fetus is fine, Luna Lovette,‚Äù the doctor assured me with a smile, but it looked forced.

Yet, hearing that my pup was fine was enough to put my mood back into a state of exhilaration. This was all I wanted, so nothing else mattered, or so I thought.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Luna Lovette, but there was a mistake with the semen you were inseminated with.‚Äù

I could feel my breathing getting faster, cursing internally at the probability of anything going wrong with this whole process.

‚ÄúBut you said my baby was fine, so how could there be a problem with the semen? I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù I made it clear, but the heat of nervousness was all over Doctor Pavel.

As my most trusted doctor, it was a thing of worry, and I did not want to expect any more. I waited for an explanation, but the high temperature of edginess only thickened the air, making me wonder if I was a monster.

I always treated my pack members with love and kindness so no one would be afraid of me. Only the elders and my enemies saw my difficult side because of their double-minded ways.

‚ÄúYou were inseminated with the wrong semen, Luna.‚Äù His voice was so low, but due to how desperate I was to know, it sounded like a trumpet in my ears, but that did not look like a problem to me.

‚ÄúAh,‚Äù I released a breath I did not even know I was holding upon hearing this news, wondering why he was so nervous about it.

‚ÄúThat shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Does the person want to be paid double? Just mention it. This pup means everything to me, and I am willing to pay any amount to keep him or her,‚Äù I explained, my smile unfading.

It had not been easy trying to get a pup. It‚Äôs not as if I hadn‚Äôt tried. Three broken hearts left me with this option. Each time, they would cheat on me or break up right before we could mate or anything.

The reason was the clich√©, of my position. Indirectly, those scumbags wanted me to make them the Alpha of my pack when they couldn‚Äôt keep their eyes off the she-wolves.

I was done with them. Done looking for a man to call my own so this was my only option because, unlike others, I can never find my true mate. My late mother saved my life during a war by sacrificing my mate bond to the moon goddess, so I wouldn‚Äôt die and would always be protected.

As for my father, he also died in that dreadful war, just like every family I ever had. Due to that, I had to take over the pack at the age of thirteen.

That also left me an orphan, but don‚Äôt underestimate me. I am tougher than I look and smarter than anyone can think due to my experience in dealing with all those old foxes in my pack.

Finally, I was going to be a mother and also be able to give my pack what I would have needed a man for without one.

As soon as this child is born, I would only have to focus on the growth of my pack, which is a great responsibility for a twenty-four-year-old Luna like me.

‚ÄúLuna, the wrong semen is from Alpha Kodak,‚Äù the doctor said in a whisper as if the mention of the name would cause his death, but yes, it could.

The test result in my hand fell on the table, and my knees grew weak. ‚ÄúAlpha what?‚Äù My lips trembled at the news. Alpha Kodak was heartless but very powerful.

I‚Äôve always thanked the moon goddess for not putting me in a situation where I would need an form any alliance with him or any other pack because, according to those who did, Alpha Kodak would always dominate the whole process, winning with the greatest shares of all the arrangements.

So, among all the donors, how did I end up with Alpha Kodak‚Äôs semen? He wasn‚Äôt even part of the list.

It could have been any werewolf but not him and how did his semen end up at my pack hospital? This was too much for me to take.

‚ÄúHow did this happen?‚Äù My smile was now replaced with a deep frown, as I no longer found the news amusing. ‚ÄúHow did his semen end up in our lab?‚Äù

This was a big problem I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. Alpha Kodak was among the richest Alphas, but that was not the problem.

He was cold, mean, and arrogant but I heard he was very soft and kind to his fianc√©, Zeeva, so how could this happen? The more I thought about it, the greater the confusion suffocating my guts.

From what I heard, his wedding had even been fixed because his marriage was supposed to bring him great profit through the collaboration with the Alpha of the North whose daughter he was engaged to.

As soon as he gets married, he can have as many children as he wants.

‚ÄúWe were carrying out some experiments, but there was a mix-up with the semen because that of your donors were found to carry some strange genes.‚Äù

Somehow, the more he spoke, the more my heart sank as it only turned to drown me deeper into the sea of cluelessness. I have run this pack independently ever since I was thirteen, leading my warriors in every war and coming out victorious.

‚ÄúMy assistant had no idea about my arrangement with Alpha Kodak‚Äôs doctor and happened to use his semen instead. Because the experiment was a secret, we could not use his real name and hence the confusion.‚Äù

For the first time, I felt deflated and heartbroken. Alpha Kodak was engaged, but I could not attend the engagement party, having sent my beta in my stead. I couldn‚Äôt lose this child. Never, but that was when a brilliant idea formed in my mind.

‚ÄúAlright. Kindly negotiate with him. I will pay him for his semen.‚Äù Since he has a fianc√©e, there will not be any complications with this arrangement, right?

I could see Pavel heave a sigh of relief, giving me hope that this matter would be resolved sooner than I thought.

‚ÄúOkay, Luna. I will make the call and get back to you. You should go and rest now. Artificial insemination is not like other pregnancies, so you have to continue to exempt yourself from stressful physical activities until the second trimester. Even at that time, it should be minimal,‚Äù Pavel advised, and I rubbed my belly once more.

‚ÄúI know. I will do anything to protect this pup. Let me know about the negotiation when you are done.‚Äù

I went to my room to rest as Pavel had instructed but my mind couldn‚Äôt. I needed closure on this matter, worsened by the intrusion of my best friend, Embry. She is the sister of my beta, Cassius.

‚ÄúWhen were you going to tell me about the pregnancy? That I was going to be an aunt? I can‚Äôt wait to see the disappointed looks on the faces of those stupid elders. How do you even cope with them? I told you to let me take care of them a long time ago, but you won‚Äôt listen,‚Äù Embry kept blabbering nonstop.

Yet, it made me happy anytime she intruded on my privacy like this. No one could stand up to me except her, and that was something I treasured. Someone who would always tell me the truth no matter how much it hurts.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not ideal to announce it yet, Embry. There is a big problem,‚Äù I told her, I could feel the excitement drain from her face, seething through her voice.

‚ÄúTell me everything,‚Äù she demanded with genuine concern. I knew she cared, so I explained everything to her. She was so filled with shock that even I was beginning to lose hope, but as if that was not enough, my mind was soon invaded by a mindlink from Pavel.

‚ÄúLuna, Alpha Kodak is not taking the news kindly. He‚Äôs demanding to have a meeting with you.‚Äù

# Chapter 2 ‚Äì Arrange a meeting with her

Alpha Kodak's POV

Don‚Äôt worry, Alpha Marrock, I promise that your daughter will be well taken care of and the date for the wedding will not be changed. You know how I like things lavish,"" I assured my soon-to-be father-in-law.

Zeeva was being a baby, but I only have myself to blame because I pampered her too much. I can also understand her fears. I am a one-woman man, but I keep being pursued by many, which makes her uncomfortable.

After the engagement, she insisted on moving in with me, but I always liked to do things the right way and refused.

How could I know it would result in this? ""Alright, Alpha Kodak, I believe you, but can you assure her yourself?"" He asked over the phone. I did not want to.

I already spoke to Zeeva a few minutes ago, but she kept whining about the same thing as if she did not trust me.

It‚Äôs a fact that a lot of she-wolves lust after me, but I chose her because of my special liking for her. She is a very good woman, and I would not trade her for anything. I love her like my wolf.

But sometimes, I feel a little guilty. Marrying her would make me the Alpha of the largest pack in North America since our packs would be merged.

I‚Äôm not selfish, but to me, it‚Äôs always business first. My pack will continue to flourish and be the best, because my pack, the Silent Claw Pack, is already among the largest at the moment.

Before my dad returns from abroad, I want to prove to him how the pack has grown ever since he entrusted it to me.

""I will have to call her later. There are urgent things‚Ä¶""

As if I was cursed with excuses, a genuine one flung in when I heard an urgent knock on my office door.

""Come in,"" I excused myself from the phone and responded to whoever was behind the door. My beta, Raul, walked in with an air of urgency.

""Alpha, we have a big problem.""

Raul became my beta because he saved me from a trap one of the pack Alphas set for me before, and that Alpha became an obituary, but Raul became my beta.

He is the only one I can trust with my life, and if he says urgent, then it‚Äôs indeed urgent.

""Alpha Marrock, I‚Äôm sorry I would have to call you back,"" I apologized to my soon-to-be father-in-law, relieved to escape from Zeeva‚Äôs childish demands for a brief moment.

Though I was looking for an excuse to justify my hanging up on an Alpha of his status, what my beta said was far from what I wanted to hear.

""What is the problem?"" I asked in annoyance. He spoke hastily.

""Your semen has been used on someone else.""

I went stiff at the news, trying to process it the best I could. What a way to ruin my good mood! I could feel my wolf trying to take dominion, and I could see the fear in Raul‚Äôs eyes when he stared at me.

Anyone would wonder why my semen had to be kept at the lab, but that was the doing of our elders.

Due to betrayals from times past, this measure was put in place to ensure that should my beta or anyone else betray me to the extent of planning my death for my position, my semen would be used to breed an heir in my place.

That was how my father secured the title after my grandfather was murdered in cold blood, so it was something worth emitting.

What I did not expect was for it to be used when I was still alive and also about to get married to the woman I love.

There were things we kept from the public but our understanding of each other was all that mattered.

I don‚Äôt think any she-wolf would make me as happy as Zeeva does. Sometimes, she makes outrageous demands exposing her insecurity but I‚Äôve always tried my best to make her happy with all the expensive gifts I could think of.

""Who is this person you are talking about?"" I was trying to subdue my wolf, but he was the one speaking through me at the moment, and it only coated the atmosphere with fear.

Jaguar, my wolf, was a lethal beast, and knowing that our heir was inside some strange woman, we both agreed on how wrong it was.

""That is what I was trying to find out, but they all seem afraid to say it. I suggest that you get the detailed information yourself.""

My blood boiled at the news, the temperature alarming. ‚ÄòThat woman should not live,‚Äô Jaguar growled, but I disagreed. That would mean killing my blood.

‚ÄòYou are right, but I can‚Äôt kill my blood.‚Äô Whatever she‚Äôs carrying is already destined to be my heir.

I could feel Jaguar relax. I was getting married, and yet, another woman was already carrying my child. There was no need to ask someone who did not have the answers I needed.

I rushed out of the office and sprinted to the lab. Anyone who saw me on the way was afraid to even greet me, but I could hear my beta‚Äôs footsteps behind me, and yet, I did not care.

The doctors seemed to be in a group meeting when I got there, and I saw the dread in their eyes when their gazes met mine.

They moved away to give me way, but I pinned the culprit against the wall, my fingers wrapped and tightening around his throat. My claws were ready to cut through his throat for making a mistake that could cause a great problem to the pack.

If my wolf took over, then Doctor Ken would be dead in a split second.

""Who did you inseminate with my semen? I want it back. I don‚Äôt want any woman except Zeeva to bear a child carrying my DNA. Do you know what that would mean for this pack?"" I growled, rage burning inside of me as his legs wagged in the air.

""A‚Ä¶Alpha‚Ä¶"" he was struggling to breathe, so I loosened my grip a little.

""Speak,"" I commanded him.

The terror in the atmosphere was very thick, but something happened to me when he spoke. ""It‚Äôs, Luna Lovette.""

My hand around his neck loosened instantly, and he fell hard on the floor, but I could not care less.

Quickly, he scrambled to his feet, gasping and panting for air. His face was covered in sweat as if he was drenched by rain.

""What did you say?""

I wanted to hear about a random girl I could pay after giving birth to my child, but how could it be a powerful Luna like Lovette? She was a respectable Luna, and I don‚Äôt understand how she would use such means when she could have any man she wanted with the click of a finger.

Well, that exempted me because I was already taken. I wasn‚Äôt sure that I even knew the face behind the name because nothing ever brought us together before.

All Alphas had a list of all packs with the names of their leaders and during mini-meetings, names did pop up. So far, Luna Lovette was the only she-wolf leader of her pack and it was one of the largest from what I heard.

But I had no idea about what happened between her and her mate. I never listened much to pack gossip, so that made me naive about her personal life.

""Alpha, Luna Lovette has been desperate for a child, and from what we heard from her pack doctor, she suffered so many heartbreaks, giving up on men altogether,"" my pack doctor Ken explained as if that would calm me.

The rest were trying to be as far from me as possible, and knowing why, I did not care. Jaguar easily gets out of control because of a personal matter I don‚Äôt want to go into.

Strangely, he behaves very well around Zeeva, so that makes her perfect for us since her destined mate rejected her at the time she turned eighteen, which happened to be my good fortune.

She was among the luckiest people to find their mates early, but also unlucky to lose him to another. Due to this, I always planned to make her happy to not regret our union or miss her rejected mate.

""All she wanted was an heir, and she paid four donors for it, but there was a mix-up when we were carrying out some experiments,"" Ken continued with his explanation since I hadn‚Äôt spoken a word.

My mind was too clouded on how to rectify this situation.

Luna Lovette might be a Luna, but she was also a woman. Since she‚Äôs carrying what belongs to me, she would have to dance to my tune, just like any other woman.

""Arrange a meeting with her,"" I ordered. I can give out anything but not my blood. Not my heir. That would be tantamount to giving out my pack.

Doctor Ken fished out his phone from his doctor‚Äôs coat and was about to dial a number, but the phone began to ring before he punched the digits.

""Speaker,"" I demanded when he looked at me with distress in his eyes. I could smell something fishy.

# Chapter 3 ‚Äì My semen is not for sale

Alpha Kodak's POV

Doctor Pavel, I was just about to call you,"" I heard Doctor Ken say over the phone, as Doctor Pavel responded with a question.

""Have you broken the news to your Alpha?""

It seemed to me that the two had already discussed and come to some form of conclusion, but who were they to discuss something so important behind my back?

""Yes, and how did your Luna take it?"" Ken asked Pavel, and I kept listening, trying to figure out if it was some kind of plot between them and Luna Lovette.

I didn‚Äôt know her well and never heard anything negative about her character, but people do things. This could be a plot to take my pack from me, and I don‚Äôt plan to make it easy on either of them.

""She is ready to pay him for his semen,"" Doctor Pavel or whoever he was speaking to said from the end of the line. My anger boiled, and Jaguar was agitated. ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt sell our pup.‚Äô

‚ÄòI know.‚Äô I assured him. Luna Lovette should know by now that I had no need for money and didn‚Äôt want any woman bearing my child who was not Zeeva.

""Doctor Ken, I don‚Äôt think that would work,"" Ken said correctly.

""What are his conditions?"" I heard Doctor Pavel ask, and for some reason, I could not hold my patience any longer, snatching the phone from Ken's hand.

""My semen is not for sale. Tell your Luna that I want to meet her."" I was not going to take any chances, and she better come up with a good explanation or bargain.

Doctor Pavel seemed hesitant, and just as I was about to make another demand, he answered.

""Her condition is very fragile at the moment. I have to discuss it first with her."" How can a powerful Luna like her be fragile? My suspicions increased even more.¬†

""You have ten minutes.""

""Can you please make it an hour? She must be resting now,"" Doctor Pavel pleaded from the end of the line, but I was trying to discern if he was just trying to buy time for her or for whatever they planned to do.

""Unless you don‚Äôt know the implications of what your error has caused, you will not be asking me for more time.""

He seemed to have caught the meaning of my words and nervously replied. ""I will get back to you shortly.""

I ended the call and waited. This was the future of my pack in the womb of another woman, and I could not think straight until Doctor Ken's phone rang again.

I still had it with me because of my suspicions and answered it. ""My Luna is ready when you are.""

""I‚Äôm on my way,"" I said without another thought. This was more important, and I had to get it over with.

I went back to my office with Raul and put on my coat. ""Call me if there is any problem. I will be back in a few hours.""

‚ÄúAlpha, please let me come with you,‚Äù he pleaded, worry shining in his eyes. I knew he was afraid I would lose control but we were both leaders.

‚ÄúTake care of the pack. You know you are the only one I can trust,‚Äù I said seriously, he bobbed his head in understanding.

‚ÄúAlright, but please take it easy and remember that she‚Äôs pregnant. Artificial means have a higher risk of miscarriage,‚Äù he subtly let out, making me understand why Luna Lovette‚Äôs doctor said her condition was delicate.

‚ÄúI will try my best.‚Äù

Not sure if this was a genuine mistake or a plan, I could not make any promises.

The Silver pack was just an hour's drive from the Silent Claw pack, and with this matter being heavy, I decided to go alone.

Luna Lovette‚Äôs beta, Cassius, met and took me to her living room. I must admit that Luna Lovette had great taste.

Before then, I took a close analysis of the things I saw in her pack. It was well-organized, and I saw most of her warriors training on the mountain with utmost seriousness. Her beta was with me, and obviously, she was not there, but everything seemed to move perfectly.

The pack was very neat, and her style of housing was splendid, choosing three-story designs. I had no idea how many families were hosted in one house, but it sure made the pack look bigger.

Her pack house was the tallest, a five-story building, and with our kind, no one would need an elevator but what surprised me was the underground living room I was taken to.

It was a blend of sophistication and feminism, but I could also discern she was a collector of artifacts as they were nicely displayed artistically around.

This was my first time in this pack, and I can applaud her for her success as I have been to many, considering she was a woman.

The struggle was not easy for Alphas, and yet, a woman like her was able to put it all together, ruling one of the largest packs in North America. Such a she-wolf was not simple.

""Alpha Kodak, please make yourself comfortable,"" she said from the top of the stairs, grace oozing out of her voice. I never looked at another woman for more than a second.

They were the ones constantly seducing me with their eyes, but somehow, I could not take my gaze off her. She commanded not only respect but also attention.

It took me a while to come out of whatever spell she seemed to have cast on me.

Her black pants and a turtleneck top, fit her perfectly, accessorized with the red shawl around her neck. Her brown hazel eyes carried a deep message I could not crack, but in my definition of beauty, she was it, charm, power, and grace, she was all of those.

Luna Lovette was not like the she-wolves I was acquainted with; there was something about her, something I did not have the words to explain, which made me careful around her.

A woman like her could easily make any man fall for her but that also brought me to the question of how those men were able to break her heart, her pack doctor disclosed.

""I‚Äôm afraid not,"" I refused. She did not try to seduce me, but it was better for me to be careful since I was already engaged and soon to be married. I never went back on my words and this was not going to be my first time.

Gracefully, she descended the stairs, sending the maids and her beta away with a wave of her hand. How splendid. Her bond with her beta and domestic workers was something of envy.

I had to talk my way through every situation but she just calmly did what a great man like me cannot do with just a wave of her hand.

""Coffee? Tea?"" She asked again, but I could not guess what she was up to. It was difficult to read her motives when she was like this and that tight smile was questionable.

What if she tries anything funny like drugging or poisoning me? I‚Äôve heard those stories a lot of times, and I‚Äôd rather not fall victim.

""I prefer we move straight to business.""

She did not seem offended by my straightforward responses, rather stretching her hand towards me. ""Then let me welcome you to the Silver pack. It must be your first time.""

For some reason, I could not even give her a formal handshake, and this time, I caught the disappointment in her eyes, but it was very brief.

She stood in front of me but was not intimidated by my height or power. She was a Luna after all.

Eccentrically, I could not also smell her scent and could not make out the kind of wolf she had.

There sure was something outlandish about her, but that was not my reason for being here, and I was glad she got the message.

""Alright. This is the deal. I am ready to pay you ten million as compensation for the mix-up.""

I laughed internally but maintained a stern composure. On second thoughts, I needed the chair, so I lowered myself into her luxury sofa.

It was just the kind I liked, and she sat on the two-in-one sofa, a little far from mine. Eagerness shone in her eyes for my response, so I did not want to waste her time.

""I‚Äôm willing to pay you ten billion to be my surrogate,"" I countered, as I watched the color slowly fade from her face. ""It‚Äôs either that, or you give me back my semen.""

# Chapter 4 ‚Äì I want the pup, but‚Ä¶

Luna Lovette's POV

As soon as Doctor Pavel informed me that Alpha Kodak wanted a meeting, I felt all my exhaustion dissipate. It had been hard to sleep with this heavy weight on my shoulder, and though Embry had insisted on coming along, I refused.

I needed a clear head with no distractions to lay my cards on the table.

This was something I had to do alone, which was why I chose my underground living room, reserved for special meetings like this. It wouldn't be right for the elders to know beforehand, so that was my reason.

I had seen Alpha Kodak from a distance, but having him this close for the first time felt awkward, especially since the reason for this meeting was not something I was proud of or wanted others to know about.

It was understandable why the she-wolves hyped him up a lot; he seemed like a clean freak with a great deal of perfection in terms of looks.

It's not a surprise with his great sense of fashion. His white shirt and black pants were neatly tucked in, and his hair was neatly trimmed, unlike most Alphas. Even with the coat he wore, which I'm surprised he hadn't taken off, his muscles were well-defined.

I rehearsed everything in my mind, trying to use my Luna charm to make him understand, but he seemed defensive with everything proposed, rejecting whatever I came up with.

This was unplanned, not that I wanted to be in a situation like this, but it was all because of my desperation.

Just as the rumors said, he was so arrogant. But since I needed this favor, I swallowed it all, except for the last part.

""I'm willing to pay you ten billion to be my surrogate.""

What made him think that I would give up a pup I desperately needed for money I didn't need? Even if I did, it wasn't worth the life of my pup. This was more complicated than I thought because he was being selfish.

Before I could refuse the demand, he slapped me with a worse one. ""It's either that, or you give me back my semen.""

I could feel the anger of my wolf, Olga, and it took me a while to calm her. Anger would destroy everything and lead to a possible war that would endanger the life of my pup, given that he or she was still in a fragile state.

I don't know how much time passed, but I was amazed by his patience. No matter how nice I wanted to be, his request drove me insane.

So, I stated it in a slow but firm way. ""I want the pup, but I can never be your surrogate.""

His expression turned cold, but his response was even more ruthless than the first and second. ""Then be my wife.""

To say that Alpha Kodak was cold-hearted was an understatement. I could feel my head spinning.¬†

Alpha Kodak was very good-looking, no doubt, and I knew how women drooled over him, but if he cared the least about his fianc√©e, he would not make this outrageous proposal.

To me, he was heartless, no matter how he tried to hide it under the special kind of swag that made him attractive, but not to me. I was done with the menfolk, and all I wanted was a pup. How is that so hard?

A bitter laugh left my mouth before I could stop it. ""Hahahaha, that is out of the equation.""

He looked offended, making another outrageous request. ""Okay. Then I want my semen back, or you abort the fetus.""

I subconsciously rubbed my belly a few times, unable to consider his solution. Over my dead body would I get rid of this pup growing in my womb?

""How can you be so heartless? You are engaged,"" I reminded him. ""You don't love me, and I don't love you, so what kind of marriage would that be? Why are you so selfish?"" I asked, my gaze not leaving his ferocious one.

He hadn't smiled ever since his arrival, but now, it was clear that he was upset, which I couldn't give a damn about.

Just when I thought I got him, his anger exploded, and with his eyes changing color, I knew his wolf was trying to dominate him, and it shone in his low growl as he spoke between gritted teeth.

""Did it not occur to you that the seed you are carrying is the heir of the Silent Claw Pack? Do you know the implications of giving birth to him out of wedlock? If you must know, that is the future of my pack in your womb.""

His words were like daggers, piercing into my soul. What have I gotten myself into? Feeling like the selfish one because I had forgotten about the importance of this pup to him, I lost all hope.

His conditions were absurd, but it made me feel rather helpless. ""Give me time. I will think up something, but your conditions are out of line.""

I could see him bloated with so much anger; I feared he was going to burst right there and then in front of me.

""I don't have time to drive back here. Every decision should be taken now.""

For the first time in years, tears stung the corners of my eyes, and I felt cornered by the pup in my womb. I could abort it and get semen from a random guy, but this was a life growing inside of me.

'If you think of aborting our pup, I will kill you before you go through with it,' Olga warned, not making it easy for me.

1m5a7jp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1m5a7jp/i_married_a_monster/,I married a monster,"My marriage to a narc/sociopath, ended in the most bizarre and unusual way. 
I left my husband in March because he was extremely verbally, emotionally and financially abusive. I consulted with an attorney who advised that we try to go to counseling to make the divorce amiable. 
After a couple months of therapy I started to feel like I wanted to examine my part in the downfall of our marriage. Maybe I was mean to him? Dismissed his feelings? 
I felt like I needed to try to hear his side of things and make it work. 

Fast forward to the end of June, I‚Äôm living with my mom in my hometown and he‚Äôs still living in Oregon. His birthday was coming  up and the 4th of July so we decided I‚Äôd fly up there to try and reconcile (dumb idea, I know)
Immediately upon getting off the plane he was cold to me.. he bought me flowers but it was almost like there was nothing behind his eyes. We went to dinner, made small talk, had sex and went to bed. 

The next day we were going to drive three hours to see our friend that got diagnosed with cancer. They were having a party for him to lift his spirits. We wake up in the morning, grab coffee and donuts- we‚Äôre laughing and smiling.. things are starting to feel normal.. and we hit the road to go to his friend‚Äôs party. 

Twenty minutes from the hotel my husband says ‚ÄúOh, btw I picked up my AK47 from my mom‚Äôs.. it‚Äôs at our house right now. I just wanted to let you know.‚Äù 
I was dead silent and my mind is racing, it almost felt like I was dreaming. Was he threatening me? Saying if I try to leave him a second time he has a gun? It was so bizarre.. why is he telling me this?! 

So my mind is spiraling and he keeps saying ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?! You don‚Äôt trust me? Why are you here if you don‚Äôt trust me?!‚Äù 
Finally we pull over at the hotel and he just keeps driving the point home that I‚Äôm crazy and I‚Äôm paranoid, I have something wrong with me for not trusting him. Everyone in the parking lot of the hotel is staring at us, we were supposed to cook dinner for 20 people and our friend is dying of cancer. 

After about 45 minutes of him screaming and calling me crazy I told him I wanted my stuff out of the car and that I was going to get a rental car so I could drive back to the city. He was crying and then he said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna make me cook alone for 20 people?!‚Äù It was amazing that that is the only thing that comes to his mind in this moment. I don‚Äôt think I even replied. Then he gets in his car and I say ‚ÄúCan I have a water bottle, it‚Äôs hot out.‚Äù And he violently chucks a giant FULL water bottle at me, screams ‚ÄúFUCK YOU‚Äù and speeds off so fast like he‚Äôs going to hit me. 

A little old couple was circling our car because they were worried about me. They offered me a ride to the airport, where I picked up a rental car and drove 20 hours back to my home state. 

This is why you don‚Äôt give them a second chance.. they want to destroy you. I‚Äôm sure there was no gun, he didn‚Äôt even want to try to reconcile or want me back in the first place.. he just wanted to make me look bad in front of our friends and tell people how horrible I am for leaving him. Now he can say I left him when our friend has cancer and he has no idea why. He also pushed me to initiate the divorce so once again he can be the victim. 

I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve had a similar experience but I‚Äôm sure you had since they‚Äôre all the same. I just needed to get this off my chest because I spent weeks reeling. ",19,1753074600.0,NarcissisticSpouses,3,1.0,False

Diagnosed with H pylori. Underwent quadruple therapy. Worst 2 months of my life. I only ate white rice, beef, and bananas for 2 months straight. By the time I got off the ppi's, sure I tested negative for H Pylori luckily, but my stomach was in shambles. I was taking zinc carnosine, vitamin c, L glutamine, sucralfate, and sticking to my white rice/beef/banana diet. I still couldn't enjoy anything like coffee or other foods. As soon as I got carried away and ate something tasty, for example, a piece of chocolate, all my progress was reset, and I had burning abdominal pain all over again. I am almost certain I had an unhealed ulcer from the h pylori. For 2 months after testing negative, I hated my life and my stomach was barely making any progress. I finally got an upper endoscopy scheduled. However, here's where the magic happens. 

3 weeks leading up to it, I started taking BPC-157 orally. It was my last resort, and I was in pain. I didn't care about the risks, I had some leftover from the past from a year ago because everyone shills it on twitter/X so thank God I kept it handy. 500mcg per day, and I started noticing INSANE improvement after a week. However, I got carried away, ate In N Out, and reset my progress. I had a wedding to attend within a few weeks and wanted to enjoy it so I said screw this and went up to 1000mcg per day. 500 in the morning and 500 before bed. I shit you not, within 2-3 weeks my stomach is 100% bulletproof again. I have been eating pizza, drinking soda and coffee, and having literally no stomach issues except mild heartburn after binging 3000 calories (which is fine with me considering how that would have probably killed me just 4 months ago lol). I literally got my life back and I can't believe it. I attended my friends wedding and all we did was drink tequilla every day for 5 days straight and eat Buffalo Wild Wings bottomless appetizers and sleep at 2am and I literally had ZERO stomach issues the whole time. Today, I not only had 6 slices of Dominoe's pizza but an hour ago I had a big mac meal at McDonalds. I have been going crazy and enjoying the hell out of it lately because I can't believe my symptoms are gone after suffering for almost half a year. I personally believe God allowed this peptide to work a miracle for me. I was skeptical about it but I think it really only helps if you have a serious issue. I had the upper endoscopy done anyways, and the GI doctor told me word for word: ""Everything looks structurally sound."" I said, ""So There's no inflammation or ulcer or signs of h pylori??"" Nope. Nothing. No issues noted at all. And I literally feel no issues anymore. 



This is not an affiliate post to shill you peptides. I do not care about selling you on the magic of peptides. However, it feels like a problem to keep this info to myself when my breakthrough was literally BPC-157 and prayer. The brand I used was from Kimera Chems, but I don't like them that much since they had some other stuff I used that shot my liver enzymes up so I would go through Peptide Sciences. They're one of the best brands you can buy any peptides from. Use at your own risk and this is not medical advice. This is what I did, and what I am thankful to God that I did lol. Otherwise, I can only imagine how bad I would still be feeling.

1m5a5mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Occipitalneuralgia/comments/1m5a5mu/posture_related_on/,Posture related ON,"I wanted to post my experience with the hope that I could share what I have learned with someone who is dealing with a similar circumstance. 

I (55M) started having symptoms approximately eight weeks ago. I think it coincided with NBA semi finals. I want to be clear that I never get headaches, the only recent headaches I can recall are the two times I had Covid. Initially, I thought I could have Covid again but no other symptoms appeared and headache continued for days. Additionally, a pounding in my left forehead when I bent over or strained. There were other weird symptoms that I didn‚Äôt know were related, like suddenly feeling unsteady, and the odd sensation of bubbles in my skull or my scalp separating from my skull.

I thought maybe I had a sinus infection without congestion, my doctor mentioned migraines but was not a big help otherwise. My CT scan was clear.

A post I saw in r/migraines was the aha moment that put the pieces together for me.

Someone had posted an image of a skull and circled the occipital nerves. When I saw that, I realized that whenever I bent over or reached or strained or turned, I was engaging that muscle. This would send a shockwave that traveled to my eye socket, which would pulse for hours. That throbbing would turn into a headband migraine that would last for hours longer.

This post also mentioned the link between ON and poor posture, specifically forward head posture. I read that and said bingo. I was already dealing with upper back muscle issues due to forward head posture.

To reduce the intensity of the headaches, I started taking magnesium supplements. Specifically Natures Bounty magnesium glycinate from Costco. The magnesium citrate did not work for me, but the glycinate definitely has an effect. I take four of these a day two with breakfast and two at dinner. I would say it reduced the intensity of the headaches by 20%.

I started stretching and doing strength exercises to combat the stresses of forward head posture as well as being more aware of my posture in general. I do about nine different stretches every day, 4 reps 30sec each (it takes about 45 minutes) and this has further reduced my symptoms another 20%.

Was feeling good last weekend and decided to change my oil. Repeatedly getting up and down from the pavement was too much. I am sure I set myself back 2 weeks, minimum. Don‚Äôt get over confident take it slow.

Some other things I find helpful:

Icing the top of your head can feel really good but honestly, I just prefer a big slushy.

My morning cocktail is 16 ounces of water mixed with a packet of liquid IV. Then chase that with a cup of black coffee and the magnesium. 

One or two puffs of marijuana and some music really helps me relax and slow down so I do not rush through my stretches.

I‚Äôve always been a cardio addict, but now I am all in on strength training, specifically focusing on my core. The goal being to lessen the stress on my back.

I bought a memory foam cervical pillow. Not sure if it helps, but I do like it just as a pillow.

Look for exercises targeting forward head posture or upper crossed posture.  Wall angels are effective for me, also rolling on yoga cylinders.

I have an appointment with new doctor this week. Going to thoroughly explain my symptoms and listen to their opinion before I mention ON.

Hoping the right person sees this and it gives them some direction.

## Key Features analysis

Selecting the right coffee and candles involves considering several factors to achieve optimal enjoyment.

**coffee Bean Origin and Roast:** Understanding the origin and roast level of coffee beans is paramount.Single-origin beans from regions like Ethiopia or Colombia offer unique flavor profiles, while blends provide more balanced and consistent tastes. Roast levels range from light, which emphasizes acidity and delicate notes, to dark, which delivers a bolder, more robust flavor with smoky undertones.

The origin of the coffee bean significantly impacts its flavor. For example, Ethiopian yirgacheffe beans are known for their luminous, floral, and citrusy notes, while Sumatran Mandheling beans tend to be earthy and full-bodied. Roast level also influences the overall taste. A light roast preserves the natural characteristics of the bean, whereas a dark roast intensifies the bitterness and reduces acidity. Consumers should consider their preferred taste profile when selecting coffee based on origin and roast.

**Candle Wax Type and Fragrance:** The type of wax used in a candle affects its burn time, scent throw, and environmental impact. Soy wax, beeswax, and coconut wax are popular natural options known for their clean burn and ability to hold fragrances well. Fragrances can range from synthetic to natural essential oils, with the latter offering aromatherapeutic benefits.

Soy wax candles are made from hydrogenated soybean oil and are biodegradable,making them an environmentally pleasant choice. Beeswax candles are derived from honeycombs and have a natural honey scent, while also purifying the air.Coconut wax candles offer a strong scent throw and a slow, even burn. The fragrances used in candles can significantly impact the ambiance, with essential oils providing natural and potentially therapeutic benefits.

**Brewing Method and Candle Burn Time:** Choosing the right brewing method for your coffee can enhance its flavor and extraction, while understanding a candle's burn time ensures longevity and value.Pour-over, French press, and espresso machines each yield different results, catering to various preferences. Candle burn times vary based on wax type, size, and fragrance concentration, with longer burn times offering more extended enjoyment.

Pour-over coffee brewing allows for greater control over water temperature and flow rate, resulting in a more nuanced cup of coffee. French press brewing produces a full-bodied, sediment-rich brew with a bold flavor. Espresso machines use high pressure to extract a concentrated shot of coffee. Consider the dimensions of candle vessel, as well as the number of wicks it has.

**Ethical Sourcing and Sustainability:** consumers are increasingly prioritizing ethical sourcing and sustainability when purchasing coffee and candles. Look for coffee beans that are Fair Trade certified or sourced from enduring farms. Candles made with natural waxes and fragrances, produced by companies committed to environmental responsibility, are also gaining popularity.

fair Trade certification ensures that coffee farmers receive fair prices for their crops, promoting economic stability and improving living conditions. sustainable coffee farms employ environmentally friendly practices, such as reducing water usage and preserving biodiversity. Candles made with natural waxes,like soy or beeswax,are biodegradable and renewable resources.

## Core Benefits

The combination of coffee and candles offers numerous benefits, enhancing daily routines and creating a more enjoyable and productive habitat.

**Enhanced Focus and Productivity:** The aroma of coffee stimulates the brain,improving focus and alertness. Combined with the calming ambiance of a scented candle, particularly those with invigorating scents like citrus or peppermint, it can create an ideal environment for work or study. This leads to increased productivity and reduced feelings of stress or fatigue.

The caffeine in coffee acts as a natural stimulant, enhancing cognitive function and concentration. Complementing this with a candle that emits a fragrance known for its energizing properties, such as lemon or eucalyptus, can further boost focus and reduce distractions. This synergy can be particularly beneficial for tackling challenging tasks or maintaining concentration during long hours.

**Improved Relaxation and Mood:** The comforting scents of candles, such as lavender or chamomile, combined with the soothing ritual of sipping coffee, can promote relaxation and improve mood. This can be especially beneficial after a long day or during times of stress. The combination creates a sense of tranquility and well-being, fostering a more positive mental state.

Certain candle scents, like lavender and sandalwood, are well-known for their calming and stress-reducing properties. When paired with a warm cup of coffee,the combination creates a multisensory experience that can promote relaxation and reduce anxiety. The ritual of lighting a candle, preparing coffee, and taking a moment to savor both stimuli can be a powerful tool for self-care and emotional well-being.

**Creating a Cozy and Inviting Atmosphere:** A carefully chosen coffee and candle pairing can transform any space into a cozy and inviting retreat. Whether it's a quiet morning at home or an evening spent entertaining guests, the combined aromas and visual warmth create a welcoming ambiance. This can enhance social interactions and create a more pleasant and enjoyable living environment.

The combination of a rich coffee aroma and the soft glow of candlelight can instantly create a sense of warmth and intimacy. Candles with comforting scents like vanilla or cinnamon can evoke feelings of nostalgia and comfort, while a well-prepared coffee can enhance the overall experience with its rich flavor and aroma. The combination sets stage for peaceful relaxation or stimulating conversation.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common queries about choosing and using coffee and candles effectively.

**what is the ideal coffee-to-water ratio for brewing?**
The ideal coffee-to-water ratio varies based on personal preference and brewing method. A general guideline is 1:15 to 1:18 (coffee:water) for pour-over and drip coffee. For French press, a slightly stronger ratio of 1:12 to 1:15 is frequently enough recommended. Experimentation is key to finding the perfect balance for your taste. Understanding the measurements of your tools and the coffee you have on hand are key for repeatable results.

**How do I prevent candle tunneling?**
Candle tunneling occurs when a candle burns down the centre, leaving wax around the edges. To prevent this, ensure the first burn lasts long enough for the melted wax pool to reach the edges of the container. This establishes a ""memory ring"" and ensures an even burn in subsequent uses. Trimming the wick to ¬º inch before each burn also helps maintain an even flame and prevent soot.

**Are essential oil candles better then synthetic fragrance candles?**
Essential oil candles offer potential aromatherapeutic benefits and are derived from natural sources, making them a preferred choice for those seeking a holistic experience. However, essential oils can be more expensive and may have a weaker scent throw compared to synthetic fragrances. Synthetic fragrance candles offer a wider variety of scents and are often more budget-friendly. The best choice depends on individual preferences and priorities.

Ever since it happened I‚Äôve been feeling anxious, nauseous, angry and just all around unwell. My head is in a fog and I can‚Äôt shake it. My heart aches. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I don‚Äôt really know where to go with this. So I‚Äôm posting here. I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I‚Äôm probably being selfish and dramatic. 

My boyfriend and I are on vacation. His mom was cat sitting for him. His cat was around 10 years old. We‚Äôve been dating almost two years. I loved his cat like he was my own. He got a call on Thursday that his cat passed away. His parent‚Äôs dog attacked his cat and also his mom‚Äôs cat. They both died. His parents have 3 outside dogs. One has killed a cat in the past. A stray cat in the yard. Their cat was inside outside and learned to only go in the backyard. They keep the back yard and front yard separated by fence. But the most aggressive dog can sneak in the house because she figured out to get the storm door open. I guess that is how it happened. His mom feels guilty of course and is sorry. 

I‚Äôm so angry. My boyfriend is trying not to be because it‚Äôs his mom. He knows it wasn‚Äôt on purpose. I know that too. But I hurt so badly for him. And for what those cats went through. She knew this dog had killed before. I‚Äôm an animal lover. I have my own dog. But I feel like this dog should be put down. That won‚Äôt ever happen though. 

My boyfriend seems to be handling things well. Idk how. He rescued him when he was a year old. It had been just then two for years. He loved him so much. I loved him too. Now I dread going home and seeing his things. His food. His litter box. His toys. His brush. All his things. I get so anxious thinking about what he and the other cat went through that led to their death. I get anxious thinking about how my boyfriend is feeling. I keep randomly crying about it. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt feel like discussing it further and I understand that‚Äôs how he is with his emotions. I just don‚Äôt know what to do with this. My boyfriend has a picture sticker on his coffee cup and every time I see it my eyes well up and I feel sick. I‚Äôm just kind of left to deal with this alone. I loved his cat so much. I treated him like I treat my own and loved him just as much. We spent a lot of time together over the past two years. But he wasn‚Äôt my cat and I have no say.",5,1753074362.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

I have been eating pizza, drinking soda and coffee, and having literally no stomach issues except mild heartburn after binging 3000 calories (which is fine with me considering how that would have probably killed me just 4 months ago lol). I literally got my life back and I can't believe it. I attended my friends wedding and all we did was drink tequilla every day for 5 days straight and eat Buffalo Wild Wings bottomless appetizers and sleep at 2am and I literally had ZERO stomach issues the whole time. Today, I not only had 6 slices of Dominoe's pizza but an hour ago I had a big mac meal at McDonalds. I have been going crazy and enjoying the hell out of it lately because I can't believe my symptoms are gone after suffering for almost half a year. I personally believe God allowed this peptide to work a miracle for me. I was skeptical about it but I think it really only helps if you have a serious issue. I had the upper endoscopy done anyways, and the GI doctor told me word for word: ""Everything looks structurally sound."" I said, ""So There's no inflammation or ulcer or signs of h pylori??"" Nope. Nothing. No issues noted at all. And I literally feel no issues anymore. 



This is not an affiliate post to shill you peptides. I do not care about selling you on the magic of peptides. However, it feels like a problem to keep this info to myself when my breakthrough was literally BPC-157 and prayer. The brand I used was from Kimera Chems, but I don't like them that much since they had some other stuff I used that shot my liver enzymes up so I would go through Peptide Sciences. They're one of the best brands you can buy any peptides from. Use at your own risk and this is not medical advice. This is what I did, and what I am thankful to God that I did lol. Otherwise, I can only imagine how bad I would still be feeling. 



TLDR: suspected stomach ulcer and severe burning abdominal pain, unable to eat or drink normally, took bpc-157, now I can eat broken glass and my stomach would probably still metabolize it with no issues.

We dated for 6.5 months and shared serious love. She asked me to move in with her a couple months before she dumped me.

At first I (m32) just let her (f36) break up with me. I didn‚Äôt fight it. I let it sit for 3 weeks. Then when we met, I gave a whole speech about how I could change and didn‚Äôt want to quit on us. I begged and pleaded. She didn‚Äôt go for it. But wanted to stay friends.

This is when it really sunk in that we might not be getting back together. I was shook and hurt. A couple days later I showed up outside her apartment building with a pre fixed meal and coffee to try and make her day easier.

She was PISSED and wouldn‚Äôt even come out and told me to leave. I said sorry a few hours later, she got even more mad.

I let it sit for 9 days tried to call her. The next morning she texted me. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stay in touch, you can‚Äôt contact me, don‚Äôt respond to this just respect it, just focus on you and your life‚Äù

That hurt so damn much.

I tried to respect it but 2.5 weeks later I couldn‚Äôt help myself to write an email apologizing again, clarity on where I fell short, my growth, stated what we shared meant more than I was ever able to articulate, and that it would mean a lot to chat even to let things land in a more peaceful place.

She responded a couple days later ‚Äúplease stop contacting me, if you continue I‚Äôll have to look into a no contact order‚Äù 

It‚Äôs so hurtful and confusing. I regret trying to do something kind and showing up outside her building with food from her favorite market.

But this kind of shift just doesn‚Äôt add up or make sense.

I know only I can give myself closure. But even after those very clear boundaries I still wish and long for this person. To me she was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù I‚Äôve focused so much on making myself into a new man.

New Job
New apartment
New car
Best shape of my life
Read books on relationships 
New recipes to cook for her
Living a different lifestyle, truly

Worked on my attractiveness intellectually, mentally, emotionally, and physically.

Not for her, but for me (ok a little bit for her)

I know I‚Äôm far better than the man she left, and definitely the man she fell for

But she cut me off so hard, I want to keep working on myself and part of me thinks maybe after 3 months no contact, she might be more receptive to a brief conversation once she‚Äôs had more time to heal. The threat of a legal matter though, I just wish we could have a mature 5 min conversation.

Is there any hope? Has anyone successfully come back from such a harsh end?

It‚Äôs going to take a lot for her to risk giving me another chance. It seems impossible, but there has to be a timeline where that emotional safety and attraction can come back. Rebuild from a foundation of mutual respect.",1,1753074329.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UAE vs Nigeria T20I Showdown: A Desert Dominance or a David vs. Goliath Farce?**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for the most lopsided cricket face-off since a toddler tried to play chess against a grandmaster. On July 21, 2025, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will host Nigeria in a T20I that‚Äôs already been priced like a bet on whether the sun will rise tomorrow. The odds? UAE is a stratospheric favorite at decimal 1.03-1.06 (implied probability: 94-97%), while Nigeria‚Äôs chances hover around 6-10%‚Äîthe statistical equivalent of betting your lunch money on a giraffe winning a marathon. Let‚Äôs unpack this farce with the gravity of a man explaining a sandcastle‚Äôs architecture.

### Parsing the Odds: Why UAE is the Cricketing Equivalent of a Camel in a Sandstorm

The numbers scream ‚ÄúUAE takeover‚Äù louder than a Dubai megamall sale. At +15.8 for Nigeria (FanDuel) and +9.7 (BetOnline.ag), the implied probabilities suggest the UAE has a 94-97% chance to win. To put this in perspective: Nigeria‚Äôs odds are less likely to succeed than a Nigerian prince‚Äôs email scam in 2024. The UAE, meanwhile, is the bookmakers‚Äô version of a done deal.

Why the gulf? Well, the UAE is a cricketing powerhouse in the making, with state-of-the-art facilities, a history of hosting high-stakes matches (including the Asia Cup 2025 contingency plans), and a squad that‚Äôs probably practiced hitting sixes while juggling dates and coffee. Nigeria? Let‚Äôs just say their cricket infrastructure is‚Ä¶ *aspirational*. Imagine trying to build a soccer team using a mixtape of YouTube tutorials and a borrowed net.

### Digesting the News: Where‚Äôs the Beef?

Recent headlines hint at why this mismatch exists. The BCCI‚Äôs refusal to schedule a series with Sri Lanka has left India‚Äôs stars (Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli) in limbo, but the UAE isn‚Äôt waiting for cricketing royalty t

1m59xtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/7daystodie/comments/1m59xtz/20_best_update_yet_review/,2.0 - Best Update Yet. (Review!),"**I wish I could have something bad to say about this update, but I can't.**  
If anything, the 2.0 update brought what was *needed* for the game to succeed, and to keep fans at their happiest. There's a lot of new additions that came with 2.0, and we'll be covering (almost) all of it.

# Storms

This new mechanic is **PERFECT** the way it is.  
Could separate parts of one biome have storms occurring independently ‚Äî still dangerous, but not soft-locking players into waiting inside a building or another biome for 3 in-game hours until it passes?  
**NO.**  
By making the entire outside area affected by storms, this helps slow down progression in a... a *FUN* way, rather than an agonizing way...

# Biome Progression

It JUST makes sense.  
I guess you could say... *""it just WORKS.""*

Biome progression was available in earlier alphas up until 1.0.  
If you wanted to travel into a hot biome like the Burnt Forest or the Desert, you'd wear lighter, cooler clothes and stock up on cold drinks to withstand the heat.  
Want to travel to the Snow Biome? You‚Äôd stock up on coffee and big, baggy clothing so you don‚Äôt FREEZE to death.  
Wasteland? You‚Äôd need armor and a LOT of bullets for the dangers that call it home.

But this time, it takes it a step further ‚Äî it expands what was missing before, with 2.0‚Äôs **all-new revamp** of how you progress to each biome.

Want to enter the Burnt Forest? **BETTER HURRY!**  
You'll be given a few minutes to complete each step in the Challenge tab for the Burnt Forest before you cook like a sweet meat stew.  
After completing tasks like drinking a Burnt Smoothie (made with mushrooms and grass mixed in water), surviving 15 minutes in the biome, and so on, you'll be granted a **BADGE**.  
You‚Äôll get the badge by visiting any Trader.

Not only that, but you'll also gain **FULL immunity** to the Burnt Forest, making Burnt Smoothies unnecessary ‚Äî unless you want the extra speed boost!

In order to progress to other Biome Badges, you'll need to complete the previous ones.  
Want to enter the **WASTELAND?**  
You‚Äôll need to complete the Burnt Survival, Desert Survival, *and* Snow Survival first.

Let‚Äôs say you want to enter the Wasteland ‚Äî wouldn‚Äôt you expect to need a gas mask to prevent inhaling radioactive fumes?  
Or if you want to enter the Snow Biome, shouldn‚Äôt you bring lots of warm clothing and hot drinks to avoid freezing to death?  
Or if you‚Äôre heading into the Desert or Burnt Forest, wouldn‚Äôt you want cooler clothes and cold beverages to survive the heat?

**No. Because Badge is better.**

# FrostClaw & Desert Plague

The 2 new enemies are **GODLIKE**.

The enemy dedicated to the frosty Snow Biome, known as the ChatGP‚Äî *anfjnj* \*cough cough\*, I mean **FrostClaw**, is a **TERRIFYING** behemoth.  
You better be good at dodging, because if you get hit by this monster's ROCKS, you‚Äôd better start preparing for your trip six feet under.

And we can't forget about the other monstrosity which endlessly stumbles its way through the Desert ‚Äî the ChatGP‚Äî sorry sorry, I mean... the **Desert Plague!**  
This enemy feels like something straight out of an Ancient Egyptian nightmare ‚Äî and rightfully so.  
If you‚Äôre unlucky enough to cross paths with it, it‚Äôll BURST open a swarm of reskinned vultur‚Äî (A swarm of bees) from its (Mouth\*) that attack you fiercely.  
You better have some level 6 Athletic Shoes or fire on hand, because if you don‚Äôt...

# Final Thoughts

2.0 is very controversial among fans right now ‚Äî especially because of how The Fun Pimps handled Biome Progression and Storms.

But the way they did it?  
It couldn‚Äôt be...  
It **COULDN‚ÄôT** be more than perfect.  
This update is **REALLY** up to date when it comes to satisfying fans...

**...I CAN‚ÄôT. I‚ÄôM SORRY.**

**THIS UPDATE FUCKING SUCKS.**

**FUCK U ALL.**

**FUCK BIOME (SLOW)GRESSION.**

**FUCK SOFTLOCK STORMS.**

**FUCK THEIR LITTLE PURPLE PIMP HAT YOU GAIN AFTER WATCHING SOME BALD GUY'S LIVE STREAM JUST FOR THE HAT TO BARELY FIT ON UR CHARACTER.**

**ALL OF IT CAN GO TO HELL.**

Back to Starbucks. Back to the unnecessary and a return to the conventional, instead of looking ahead. More mandates and tighter regulations have never been the driving force in progress. It's breaking away from normative practices that cultivates evolution. Once you go back to being just like any other fast food company, you're no longer the ""Premier purveyor"" of coffee you say you are. You're just another chain in the link. CLAIMING to be different or better while you do everything to fit yourself into the same molds as others doesn't make you special, BEING does. This used to be a job where you could see yourself as the main character because you were allowed to BE you. You could walk in, and everyone was unique. Aside from the apron, there was no uniformity. That's because every single life is brilliantly divergent. Each and every person on this planet is their own person, an individual, one of a kind. We aren't meant to be cookie cutter, and we aren't just cogs in the machine. Stripping away the sense of self has always been the first step of compulsory conformity, and it's no different for the ""Back to Starbucks"" agenda. It has always felt painfully obvious for anyone to see from the moment this wave of ideas was announced. But I guess no one cares about the tide creeping in until a flood rips through their door.

So my question to you all is do you think he is actually genuinely interested in me? I know he probably wouldn‚Äôt have spent the night chatting to me or even willingly choose to come meet me at another bar if he wasn‚Äôt. I also know he probably wouldn‚Äôt have let me know what his schedule is gonna be like after this weekend as well if he wasn‚Äôt but I think where I am just thrown off a bit is just by the fact he hasn‚Äôt responded yet.

Given the fact we aren‚Äôt dating and we just met I wasn‚Äôt expecting for us to text all day or anything like that. But I also just feel like if he was also genuinely interested in making plans that he wouldn‚Äôt take over a day to reply? I know he‚Äôs also busy and all as well but still leaves me just on the fence about if am wrong to expecting a text back within a day atleast?

Massive warhammer 40k fan. 

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

It should be noted I'm pretty sarcastic and dry sense of humor. Has a 12 year old sense of humor. Also can't forgot my ability to say a random historical fact. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl. Pink Floyd is my all time favorite band. Dogs is my favorite song by them. If I had a time machine I would see them live. But I did see Brit Floyd years ago and that was awesome. ",0,1753073230.0,cf4cf,0,0.5,False

When things fell apart between my parents,
there was no explosion, no shouting.
Only a kind of dull silence that slowly took over everything.
And within that silence: Mom.
She was still there.
But smaller.
More tired in her movements.
As if she herself didn‚Äôt quite know where she now belonged in the house
that suddenly wasn‚Äôt their house anymore,
but a place full of things that no longer made sense.
And me?
I became something other than a child.
Not suddenly. But quickly.
I listened while she cried.
I took care of things while she trembled.
I asked about papers, real estate agents, furniture.
I had to take care of her.
Because she had always taken care of me.
We sold the house.
The family home.
My childhood, my room, the hallway where I slid in socks,
the smell of her shampoo in the morning.
I walked with her from room to room,
trying to keep her upright as she packed her entire past into boxes
that seemed too light to hold so many memories.
She looked at the window where Dad used to drink his coffee.
I looked at her face.
And I knew: this is a goodbye neither of us understands.
But I held her.
I was sixteen. Or seventeen.
Or just old enough to realize I was carrying things
that should never have been on my shoulders.
And yet I did it.

**Story time**

I‚Äôd been having something of an awful morning with running late for a doctors appointment and having to deal with an annoying understaffed bank, so I was not in the mood for anything. I just wanted to get a coffee and go home. Now I have a habit of people watching while I‚Äôm out and about, and I spotted a guy acting shady around the counter of the bubble tea place.

I watched for a few seconds until I worked out what he was up to. He kept reaching out to the maneki neko on the counter. ‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs stealing‚Äù I thought to myself. Mystery solved. None of my business. He was trying to steal the cheap bead necklace around the cat‚Äôs neck. Hardly a crime worth bothering with.

It took a couple of moments to process everything. If he‚Äôd been stealing food or something necessary I wouldn‚Äôt have given a shit, but all he was doing was destroying part of the decorations. Vandalism pure and simple. The thought of mindlessly harming something that exists only to make people happier seriously aggravated me.

I didn‚Äôt know I was going to do it. I detest dealing with people at the best of time because they‚Äôre irrationally unpredictable, let alone someone who could actually snap, but inaction is the far worse sin. If you see something and it‚Äôs in your power to help, then you absolutely should.

So what I did was walk up behind him, loudly clap my hands, and then bark ‚ÄúOy!‚Äù when he gave me a blank look. He very quickly stalked off in disgruntled disgust. Without the necklace. I did see him skulking about, but it didn‚Äôt look like he was planning on trying anything else. Still, in for a penny, in for a pound, so I went back to the bubble tea stall and made sure the staff knew what had happened. The clerk said he‚Äôd seen the guy hanging around and saw the end of what happened, so he thanked me for stepping in.

It was an interesting little episode, even if all I really felt was tired and sick of the awful state of humanity. At least now I know that if I need to step up, I will. That‚Äôs something.

1m59cl7,https://i.redd.it/as10pmw6m5ef1.png,"Monster energy made me grow grey hairs at 23 years old, not a discouragement post but a warning","I love monster, they've got some of the best flavors ever from any brand and I love drinking and collecting them.

But they affected my health and induced added stress that wasn't there before, I didn't notice it but my body is starting to show early signs of it. So I have to leave it so I don't accidentally cause unnecessary ageing on my hair.

If it was one or two I'd chalk it up to a mere coincidence, but there's 5 already. (3 in the picture shown here)

It's actually scary that I check the roots of dark hairs and see some of them becoming grey, and this happening right when I'm 23 doesn't make sense since I've never had even one gray hair up until this year, unless you take into account that since December last year I started drinking monster energy sporadically (and almost daily since May)

I don't mean this as ""energy drinks are bad"", they're not, but caffeine is messy with iron absorption and the cortisol boost is too much for me even if I'm unstressed naturally. MY body reacts this way and it's probably a mix of the caffeine and the dormant genetical features that I've inherited from my parents being accelerated by it (my mom's hair started greying out at her late 30s and my dad's receeding hairline started in his early 30's)

By the way here's a medical study for reading if you want numbers on the topic, 42% of young men were found to be affected: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9824121/

What's weird is that these are not exactly ""grey"" hairs, they're more like a silver or platinated color, I almost thought it was the reflection of the light on the dark strands.

Also on other details, I don't smoke, don't drink alcohol, I live alone in a house and don't have to work, thanks to the saints that are my parents and the government to an extent (I'm just saying this to clarify there isn't work stress involved, I'm not proud of this fact and actively look for a job)

Also I don't drink normal coffee or any type of cappuccino, macchiato or any other source of caffeine, not even tea. Monster is the only source of caffeine I had for the last 7 months, and my hair started greying/silvering out.

Isolating sources of hair ageing, there can only be one natural one for me which is genetics from my parents, and there's no natural reason why I'd have such an early onset in my 20s with multiple strands silvering out, both my parents never had this and neither did my grandparents so there isn't a hidden gene here jumping to bite me unless my great great grandpa was Geralt of Rivia himself.

So I can logically point to energy drinks in this specific case and say they probably accelerated my hair ageing from already existing factors established by my parents.

If you drink monster and enjoy it that's great, I'm in that camp. But you gotta know that it could make you lose your hair or silver it out, among other things like weakening your bones (it's theorized it's a catalyst for osteoporosis)

However if you know that this can happen and accept it, be happy and drink monster! I wish I could do it but I like my hair too much.

Any kind of soda is bad for you and I don't drink them either, only Monster, but now it seems like I'll leave that too. Also I've only drank the zero variants and ultra series.

Anyway, hopefully this helps. I'll respond to comments and read if anyone has a better idea of what's happening/can explain things better.",0,1753071692.0,monsterenergy,34,0.45,False
