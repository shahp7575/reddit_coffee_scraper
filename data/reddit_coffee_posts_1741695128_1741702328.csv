Looking to upgrade my pc that i built nearly 4 years ago. Not sure whats a priority to upgrade first/ what to upgrade too. I play alot of competitive games like Escape from tarkov, R6, but also really enjoy story games for when im busy with work like Baldurs gate 3 rimworld ect. Bought the newest monster hunter game which made me realise my PC is in dire need of a rebuild especially since im starting to experience lots of random crashes and blue screens. Current specs are as follows:

CPU:AMD Ryzen 5 2600X Six-Core Processor

GPU:Nvidia Gefore 1660 super 

Motherboard:Msi b450 tomahawk max

Ram: 16GB's of corsair ram, 2x8GB sticks

Case: Corsair ICUE 465X RGB Midtower case

Power supply: Be quiet 600W

Storage: Old sandisk ssd 480GB(desperately needs an upgrade i know)



Built this pc in early 2021, just looking to play newer titles without it looking like a ps2 game, open to suggestions of specific part upgrades or just flat out a new pre build entirely. 

Budget is between 200-800GBP(250-1k USD) realistically to get the ball rolling but could be increased for a prebuild or something. 

Will happily buy someone coffee as a thankyou :)",1,1741702208.0,buildapc,0,1.0,False

1j8r81c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j8r81c/how_do_i_get_out_there/,"How do I ""Get out there""?","I used to be such a social person. In my early 20s I was the life of the party and I was known for my humor, and bravado. I was the guy who could go out to a bar by myself, find friends, have great conversations, and integrate into groups of strangers regardless of who they were. I used to perform stand up comedy, and poetry, and had a huge group of friends and followers. People would reach out to me, and I would reach out to them. I was a traveler an adventurer and a Renaissance man.

But time moves on. Now I'm in my early 30's and I've lived at least 5 different lives. Because I traveled so much, I never had the time to establish a relationship (it's been about 10 years since my last one and it only lasted 3 months. Ended well though. I only had one relationship which soured but it was back in high school.), I never had kids, and I never established my own ""group"" of friends because I never spent more than a year or two in any one given place before I'd find myself somewhere else, alone, and starting over. I don't really have a social media presence, or online community I am actively a part of. I find it difficult to relate to people now. I have settled in an area, and stopped adventuring, and find myself self-isolating. I don't really care to drink, and I don't really like crowds. I've gone to a few more stand up comedy shows, and have done very well still, but the other comics don't want anything to do with me. We don't hangout or have more than small conversations. They don't tell me where their shows are or what's happening. I get it. I'm now the ""old guy"" despite being very young still. If I do go out to a bar nobody talks to me or snubs me when I start one (often they look at me like I have three heads. If it's a woman, forget it, they just outright move away from me like how dare I have the audacity to even speak with them)

On the dating front i have 0 prospects. I'm not unattractive, perhaps a little short, showing my age, my teeth ain't so white, my face ain't so smooth, my skin is wind beaten and well traveled as I am, showing its years, but I'm far from ugly. But in the physical world no woman wants to talk to me, and in the digital world online dating is a graveyard. I've been back on bumble, Tinder, he'll even facebook dating, I've tried them all, and I haven't matched with anybody in over a year except once or twice and it never went anywhere, not even to getting a drink together or something. 

So here I sit in my new house. Its empty because I have nothing after so many years of downsizing. Everything I own fits inside of a 2018 Kia forte. I have a job I work 40 hours a week at, so I've never had so much free time in my adult life (I'm used to working 80-100+ hours. Unsurprisingly the few relationships I did have over the years were with co workers. Normally frowned upon, I know, but when you travel and work so much that's the only consistent pool of people you've got. Work is where all the life stuff happens when you live at work)

And tldr, I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. I tried getting into social media, but even online communities don't interact with me. I've gone out and people don't interact with me. I feel like a ghost. It's hard for me to want to go to a coffee shop because I know I'm going to spend too much money for an overpriced coffee that I'll drink in silence alone until I leave. It's hard to go out to a bar for the same reason. And because nobody talks to me or cares to engage me in conversation anymore, it's been devastating for my self image and I feel I have no reason to leave the house. I have coffee here. I have alcohol here. I have food here. I will still be alone here.

I'm not depressive, or depressed. I just feel disconnected from the world and forgotten about.

About two years ago, I moved back in with my mom because I was going through some mental health stuff/family drama. Since then, my sex life has been... *tragically* sparse. Like, I‚Äôve only had a few hookups, and they‚Äôve been like 6 months apart. And every time I do hook up, I‚Äôm soooo glad I did and I‚Äôm like *‚ÄúYES KING, WE‚ÄôRE BACK IN THE GAME!!‚Äù* ‚Äî but then I get anxious again and don‚Äôt do it for another half a year.

The thing is, before all this, I was a *certified whore*. Like, I was out here having fun, regular hookups, feeling hot, living my best life. And I *really really* want to get back to that, especially because I‚Äôm planning on moving out soon AND I‚Äôm going away for a week ‚Äî which feels like the perfect time to have a little ho phase revival, right? BUT ‚Äî the anxiety is still there.

One of the biggest things holding me back is that I haven‚Äôt had sex in a while, and I‚Äôm scared that if I meet up with a guy I‚Äôm gonna have to be like *‚Äúuhhh sorry if I‚Äôm awkward I haven‚Äôt done this in a minute‚Äù*. But then I was thinking... what if I *leaned in* to that energy and made it, like, a roleplay? Like *‚ÄúOh nooo I haven‚Äôt had sex in sooo long, will you teach me how to do it again, daddy?‚Äù* üòàüòÇ Honestly that idea makes me kinda horny, so like... maybe that's the way in?

Another layer here is that I quit drinking, and when I *was* in my slut era, I was usually drunk when I hooked up ‚Äî which definitely helped with my anxiety. But I‚Äôm never drinking again, so now I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to channel that same ‚Äúdrunk confidence‚Äù but as a sober person. Basically, I‚Äôm trying to be the whore I *used* to be... but *consciously* lmao.

Also, I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm way more into a hookup if we have like a *quick little date* beforehand ‚Äî like a drink (obviously not for me anymore), a coffee, a walk ‚Äî just *something* to break the ice. But I feel like that‚Äôs not always the vibe with Grindr, so idk how to navigate that without being awkward.

I guess my question is... has anyone else been through this? Like, trying to get your slut groove back after a dry spell + quitting drinking? Or has anyone tried sex therapy and had success with it? Because my mind is like *‚ÄúLET ME BE A WHORE‚Äù* and my body is like *‚Äúmm sorry king we‚Äôre scared‚Äù*.

Any tips? Or does anyone just wanna affirm me and tell me I *will* indeed reclaim my sluttiness soon?",2,1741701060.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

Together 14 years and married for 10. Two kids 5&7.  

We‚Äôve been having some larger issues as of the late. Mostly because I am refusing to keep up with the dog and pony show that is our relationship. After yesterday‚Äôs discussion it is clear there is no path for us to come out of this mess.  She told me she wants me to provide acts of service for her and the family constantly but I should never even want sex. I don‚Äôt expect it, but I guess that‚Äôs not enough? 

We have the most horrendous sex every 8 weeks, on her every other ovulation. I have learned to never initiate, touch, or any thing of the sort. I just have to let her send the ques. Which go like this. . . . 
It‚Äôs 430-5am, again about every 8 weeks. I am woken by her jamming her hand down my boxers and I get a few rough tugs. That‚Äôs my que to rub her where and how she likes, she trained me so I know exactly what to do, where, and with appropriate pressure. If I do a good enough job with my hands I get to use my tongue. . . Something I used to love. Id have gone down on her any time at the drop of a dime. . . . I‚Äôve lost that desire now. Anyway, back to the checklist. After she gets off I am then permitted to engage in PIV, but not for long. So even though I‚Äôve had no warm up, no tease or foreplay. I‚Äôm supposed to be done in just a couple of minutes. If I am not, too bad. That‚Äôs it. 
And that‚Äôs how it goes. That‚Äôs life. I‚Äôm still supposed to get up and make the coffee and do the chores and feed and walk the dog and be home when the kids get out of school and grocery shop and cook, then clean some more. Oh don‚Äôt forget the outdoor and garage maintenance, cause that‚Äôs on me too. 

Yesterday I was extremely blunt in sharing my displeasure.  I moved into our office and she‚Äôs finally upset about it.  She knows I crave more intimacy and connecting with her. But she says it‚Äôs just never going to happen.  How she feels like I think I am owed something? Excuse me? But you don‚Äôt owe me a thing, other than honesty. And she finally did it. She finally brought the honesty about intimacy. She said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt give you what you want you want in that department‚Äù. 

I haven‚Äôt been the recipient of oral in like 3 years ? When she did it was only very brief. And look - I‚Äôm a clean guy.  I shower daily, brush, and floss. I am clean and not a smelly dude. I clip my nails and maintain overall clean appearance. 

I have just came to the conclusion that she‚Äôs a lazy lover. She wants someone else to do all the work, around the home and in the bedroom. She‚Äôs lazy when it comes to affection. She wants to get home from work, put on sweats, lay in bed and watch trash tv while she scrolls her phone. 
Lemme tell ya. Good fuckin times, with a major emphasis on lack of fuckin. . . . 

It is what it is. I blame nobody but myself. 
Let the proceedings begin. Hope we can keep it clean and civil.

Real estate has been a challenge, so while we work toward securing the right space, I want to make an impact this summer and start building our presence in the community.

One idea I‚Äôve been considering is launching a coffee trike to ride through the streets, pop up at events, and introduce people to our brand before we officially open. Originally, I envisioned going all out‚ÄîLinea Mini espresso machine, dual-fuel generator, water pump, the whole nine yards. But the upfront cost is steep, and I‚Äôm questioning whether that level of investment is necessary right away.

Would it still be worth building the cart if I start small and focus on pour-over coffee, highlighting the roaster we‚Äôre working with? The idea would be to scale up over time, eventually turning it into a fully functional mobile espresso setup.

For those who have done pop-up coffee, mobile setups, or even just bootstrapped a business‚Äîis starting small the right move? Would offering just high-quality pour-overs be enough to generate excitement and establish a presence?

1j8qtou,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j8qtou,Ottman/Coffee Table.,"This is my largest project to date. And a project I learned from every step of the way. 

My pup opened his shampoo on an ottoman ive had for years. 

So I decided to use the frame and pallet wood to redesign it. I really the the sides. I used only the slats from the pallet cut them down to two inches and attached with a nail gun. 

The top had several different patterns. The first was 1 inch slats all the way across. I tried to level it all with a router and really screwed it up. I scraped that and had a few other patterns but ultimately used the pattern you see in the pictures.

All the different wood looks great together on the sides but the top leaves something to be desired. 

It was free, I learned a lot, and my pup already bit  2 corners because he is a jerk. Working with pallet wood is hard. Nothing is straight or level but I really love the wood once finished. It is finished with 3 layers of shellac. 

Thanks for everyone in this sub that helped. There was a person that introduced me to hand plane. And i had a great time learning, sharpening and using my no. 5 jack plane. And another that user that convinced me to use shellac.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I (25m), and my gf (23f), have been dating for a year and we don't live together. The weekend before our anniversary, I booked a 5-star hotel and organized a retreat for us to celebrate. I gave her 3 gifts and she didn't bring me anything, not even a note, saying she's waiting for her paycheck, I wasn't upset ATM cause I know she's been having some money problems so I paid for the weekend and the gifts. The day of the anniversary (Tuesday, after the weekend), I didn't want to be the first to wish a happy anniversary, because I believed I already did enough initiation, plus I had a feeling she'd forget. she worked all day, then texted me that she went home tired, then went out to eat with her friend, and then went out for coffee with her friends, she went home at 11pm and she was off the next day, so I expected a 10 minute call from her to catch up and acknowledge the day. She didn't. She later sent a very long apology and asked for a second chance. But as it's part of a larger pattern of emotional neglect, I asked for a break until Thursday, a couple of days to cool off. I was still feeling upset and resentful, so I reached out on Sunday. We agreed to not talk about it until our next date. During the date, she avoided the subject, and when I brought it up, she did not apologize or validate my feelings, but rather blamed me for taking 4-day-break instead of 2 and complained that everyone keeps punishing her when she messes up while she lets most things go. I made a counter-argument that the 1st anniversary should be special and that the break that I took was justified, especially that it's part of a larger pattern of detachment and emotional neglect.

I'm quite keen to learn something much lower level. This is for no reason other than I realised after working on computers for 20 years, I don't *really* know how they actually work.

Also full disclosure, being able to subtly drop into conversation that I know how to program in Assembly is quite the flex!

I've also taught myself new skills by going ""I want to build a guest book feature for my Freeserve hosted website - go and build one"".

My plan is to take the same approach to learning more about Assembly.

Does anyone have any ideas what would be a good starter project? Ideally something more adventurous than ""hello world"" but also not spending a decade writing my own operating system!

My wife and I are local business owners, and we‚Äôre thinking of opening something new in town‚Äîa ""Dirty"" Soda Shop‚Äîand we‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on it!

For those unfamiliar, a dirty soda shop is similar to a coffee shop but centered around soda instead. Customers can choose from preset drink combinations or create their own using a mix of soda (Coke, soda water, etc.), flavored syrups, creams, ice cream, and more. It‚Äôs a fun, customizable experience for all ages.

We see this as more than just a drink shop‚Äîit could be a great spot to hang out with friends, host casual get-togethers, or be a fun stop for visitors to Rochester. These shops have been growing in popularity, and a recent one in Maple Grove, MN, has been a huge hit. We really think this could be something people here would enjoy!

We‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the shop‚Äôs look and feel. Should we go for a nostalgic, old-school soda shop vibe? Or something more modern and fun?

For location, we‚Äôd love to be near downtown, but businesses like this tend to struggle there. Instead, we‚Äôre considering the northwest side of town, possibly near West Circle Drive, where there‚Äôs more steady traffic and accessibility.

What do you think? Would a dirty soda shop be a good addition to Rochester? Would you visit? Do you have ideas for aesthetics or location? We‚Äôre open to any and all feedback!

After seeing the Pakled homeworld, the whole species makes little sense. Even with alien assistance, they shouldn‚Äôt be able to pose a threat to other civilizations.

But what if...

Once upon a time, the Pakleds were much like us, finding that their rapidly advancing technology was causing cognitological paradoxes. Even highly studious Pakleds found it hard to resist spending most of their days doomscrolling, gaming, and generally squandering their mental potential.

Then one scientist had an idea: what if she could harness this wasted resource? What if idle minds could be put to use as processing power? She discovered a latent psychic potential in the Pakled genome and used it to develop a primitive hive mind ‚Äî one that could run programs using the passive, zoned-out minds of Pakleds nearby.

The technology showed promise, until it fell into the wrong hands. When the scientist unexpectedly died, her son, a gamer, found the experiment‚Äôs code on her computer. He shared it with his friends, who realized it could vastly improve their virtual headsets accuracy. They tinkered with the code, expanding the network of connected minds exponentially.

Then came a realization: you could influence individual nodes. A new game was born. They called it The Paks.

You could make a node go to the bathroom. Take a coffee break. Flirt with a coworker. More than a game, it became an obsession. Some players tried to turn their ""pet nodes"" into movie stars or powerful politicians. Others sabotaged nodes just for fun ‚Äî sending one into a hole, then dispatching a repair crew only to remove the ladder.

The obsession grew. Players refused to stop just because their own lives were coming to an end. By then, the hive mind had expanded across the entire planet, with enough processing power to digitally recreate the players‚Äô consciousness. And so, they made the transition.

Now, the former gamers persist as the ""guiding minds"", using the Pakleds like an elaborate Sims game: Choose a ""Scientist"" career path for this node. Make it build a Warp core. Assign others to install it into a starship. Once it‚Äôs finished, put together a crew, send them out, and watch their antics for a while. Then go back to playing ""Who Has the Biggest Hat?""

So while a guiding mind may get invested in conquest and expansion for a while, they‚Äôre likely to grow bored after a few weeks and shift focus to trivial tasks. Meanwhile, individual Pakleds continue their lives in a state not unlike their ancestors who spent all their time glued to their screens.",6,1741699524.0,startrek,2,1.0,False

I am the side that got left with a fistfull of feelings that have nowhere to go now.  
Ngl even though we had a nasty fight the day before I was not expecting that AT ALL. Once he told me i just went to brush my teeth cause i was still processing. I did not say a thing for 5 minutes straight after he declared he is breaking up with me. He caught me while i was making coffee for me and him, and then all of sudden i was making coffee for me only? What???

First day i needed to get a flat for myself and my two cats, which was frantic. Of all the days my ex man chose the sunday morning, and i live in a super christian country where nothing works on sundays. My friends helped me a ton, i had some cries with them, some laughs, managed to find a flat 10 minutes walk from work that accepted my two cats, but by the end of the day i was just sooo tired, way too tired to process anything.

Yesterday was a mess. I decided to kickstart the healing the best i can. I took a day off, i cried, i mourned, i hurted, called my family and i spent this time thinking a lot, and like, min-maxed grieving that love that i still have, obviously, but now it suddenly became only mine to carry. Sometimes, when you are the dumpee, there is this profound feeling of shame, of being the looser that got left with heartbreak while the other side is already so much further in the healing.  And somehow - i managed to deal with that and just this thing alone made me feel so much lighter.

Today i am not only feeling super proud of how i handled all of the emotional pain. I am also feeling  accepting. Dont get me wrong. It does hurt. I lost my best friend. I lost my everyday i shared with him, the family of me and two cats he seemed to love too. I lost home to some extend, and i do feel lost with navigating this. And i also feel sometimes scared of reaching to the memories that need to be grieved, cause the fact i lost these moments forever will still cause pain for some time. I somehow dont mind it though. Its just the waves of random memories and without shame and with the realisation, it is only my love now it is just emotions i need to slowly release. It is a process and im fully ok with it being long, cause even though i am going to cry it is not going to be with pain.

I wouldnt go back to him, cause the trust and safety - they are all gone. Our relationship would never go back to what i miss. I lost it forever and I intend to mourn it, cause there is a lot of beautiful moments to mourn, especially the mundane everyday moments that created this home we lived in and that i had to abruptly leave.

If you are a person that just heard these painful things after a long term relationship - that they did not love you  for some time - please, let me reassure you, you are not a sucker. Going out of the heartbreak requires HUGE strength and if anything you are the strong one. It is okay - in my case its necessary - to cry over this and reminiscent and then get tired, distract yourself and repeat. Because with each memory you cry over it gets better. Yesterday i cried cause i couldnt dm him that i got a ridiculously huge veggie kebab for pennies, among many other things. And today i dont feel like i need to cry about my huge kebab for pennies and i can get it again and just enjoy it.

I gave her 3 gifts and she didn't bring me anything, not even a note, saying she's waiting for her paycheck, I wasn't upset ATM cause I know she's been having some money problems so I paid for the weekend and the gifts. The day of the anniversary (Tuesday, after the weekend), I didn't want to be the first to wish a happy anniversary, because I believed I already did enough initiation, plus I had a feeling she'd forget. she worked all day, then texted me that she went home tired, then went out to eat with her friend, and then went out for coffee with her friends, she went home at 11pm and she was off the next day, so I expected a 10 minute call from her to catch up and acknowledge the day. She didn't. She later sent a very long apology and asked for a second chance. But as it's part of a larger pattern of emotional neglect, I asked for a break until Thursday, a couple of days to cool off. I was still feeling upset and resentful, so I reached out on Sunday. We agreed to not talk about it until our next date. During the date, she avoided the subject, and when I brought it up, she did not apologize or validate my feelings, but rather blamed me for taking 4-day-break instead of 2 and complained that everyone keeps punishing her when she messes up while she lets most things go. I made a counter-argument that the 1st anniversary should be special and that the break that I took was justified, especially that it's part of a larger pattern of detachment and emotional neglect.

For context, I have a pretty velcro-y, 8month old babe who, unfortunately, hates being worn most of the time. He'll tolerate it for a little bit but I've gotten pretty good at just holding him and getting stuff done.
 
We also chose not to do cry-it-out, so we are still slowly crib training and making progress, but I don't have nap time to do chores for this reason. I usually hustle during his wake windows, so I take the opportunity to put my feet up and enjoy snuggling him during his two naps while I can. He is a light sleeper so the times that I did get him in the crib, I was so afraid to make noise and ruin it that I didn't get anything done anyway and watched the monitor like a hawk.

I think these two things are definitely working against me. 
We are working on them as we can, but also, I don't know that it feels like the morally correct choice for me personally to push away my baby and stress him out all day in order to tirelessly keep up the house. I let him fuss, to be sure, but I try not to let it go on for too long. I know he's just a baby and won't remember etc, but I also feel like his emotions ans feelings of connectedness to me should still matter.

I am trying to work on my small, consistent habits - every wake window, I wash a bottle before feeding him a new one, and head to the laundry room to switch a load. I try to tidy at least a small space, etc. But I feel like I'm in a boat full of water, scooping it out by the spoonful lol, and the water is still coming in anyway. Maybe this is normal? Maybe it's the reality given our context right now?

I do have occasional help from my mom, and my husband does what he can, but he works long hours and as a SAHM I would love to welcome him home to a not so messy environment for both of our mental health. 

On a good day, I get the laundry caught up and wash all the bottles, fed all of us lunch and dinner, (likely didn't get to finish the dishes as my son wakes super easily at night), and mayyybe wiped down a toilet. 

There is so much about the house that isn't getting clean. I stare at stains that I constantly have to say, ""I'll get to it when I have a hand in a second"" and that second rarely comes haha. 

Lately, on the rare occasion my son is playing well independently for longer than i expected, I find I really need to sip a coffee and catch my breath for two seconds. 

So, fellow new and veteran parents- is this just  reality and I need to lower my expectations so I don't keep getting stressed about it?

Tips, solidarity, insight - all appreciated!

I‚Äôm in my early 20s and recently started dating a girl for the first time. We‚Äôve been on four dates so far, and it has been incredible. For the longest time, I thought I was ace because dating and sex never really interested me. Growing up in a strict household didn‚Äôt help either‚Äîit kept me from exploring relationships until after I turned 18. Even when I did start going on dates, nothing ever led to a relationship. I just never felt anything for men and wondered if I was being too picky.

That changed when a coworker of mine asked for my socials and, not even a week later, invited me out for coffee. I assumed she just wanted to be friends, but something about the way she carried herself during that meetup made me wonder if there was more to it. After that, we kept in touch in a way that felt‚Ä¶ subtly flirty(?), and during our next shift together, she casually asked if I had any plans for Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Äîeven though it was still pretty far off.

In full gay panic mode, I rambled about my solo plans, and when I asked what she was doing, we kept getting interrupted by another coworker. By the end of the day, I realized that coworker also had a crush on me and apparently lacked all sense of timing, which made the interruptions even more frustrating.

Then Valentine‚Äôs Day came, and she asked me to be her valentine. We met up‚ÄîI brought her chocolate, she got me flowers‚Äîand it turned out to be one of the best dates I‚Äôve ever been on. After bar-hopping, we ended up at her place, standing by the kitchen window, talking while listening to a playlist she had made based on our music tastes. That‚Äôs when we finally confessed to each other. She told me she had her eye on me since the first time we met, and I admitted I felt the same. She also confessed how annoyed she was that my coworker kept interrupting because she had been planning to ask me out for awhile now.

We kissed, I stayed the night, and the next morning, we had breakfast together. Since then, we‚Äôve gone on two more dates, and I‚Äôve realized something: I have never felt this way about a man before. I can find them attractive and, on rare occasions, have surface-level crushes, but the moment I see chest hair, I immediately lose interest. I‚Äôve kissed men in the past, but it never meant anything to me‚ÄîI thought it was just something adults did, something I was supposed to experience without really questioning how it felt. Every time, it was just a motion, a task to check off, never sparking anything inside me. But kissing her? That was different. It was like something clicked into place, like my body and mind were finally aligned in a way they had never been before. There was warmth, excitement, and a feeling so natural that I didn‚Äôt have to convince myself I was enjoying it‚ÄîI just was. For the first time, I understood what people meant when they talked about sparks.

And now, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her. The way she smiles when she sees me, the way she looks at me like I‚Äôm someone special, the way she makes me feel so comfortable just by being near her. I hope this turns into something real. I hope I can call her my girlfriend one day.

But now, I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Äîdoes this mean I‚Äôm a lesbian? Have any of you had a similar realization?

1j8q983,https://i.redd.it/418gl2f772oe1.jpeg,A neuroscientist‚Äôs journey in life and lab,"My full interview with Abinayah John for BEYOND SC!ENCE magazine.

- How does your typical day in your life looks like?
Every morning, my first task is to brew a cup of coffee. I've transformed into an early riser, waking up at 5 AM to go rowing. Surprisingly, I never used to consider myself a morning person, but now it has become an integral part of my daily routine. Starting the day with exercise sets a positive tone for what lies ahead and gives me a sense of achievement. Once I finish my rowing session, I hop on my bike and make a quick 10-minute ride from the boat house to the laboratory.

I always plan my week in advance, ensuring I'm well aware of the tasks awaiting me each day. One of the aspects I love about my job is the variety in my schedule; no two days are the same. Most days are packed with experiments that can be long and demanding, whilst other days I spend time analysing data and writing reports. Every day, I typically allocate around 30 minutes in the morning for administrative responsibilities like replying to emails, placing lab orders for reagents and equipment, and managing the mouse colony.

A typical experimental day starts with the preparation of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF),  a specialised buffer solution used to immerse isolated brains or brain slices. While the equipment and aCSF are cooling in the freezer before dissection, I proceed with brain slice preparation. Afterwards, I allow the slices to incubate for an hour before beginning the recording process.

During this waiting period, I engage in data analysis or delve into research papers. For several hours thereafter, I meticulously patch cells using a delicate capillary glass tip, enabling me to record the activities of specific neurons at the single-cellular level. It's akin to eavesdropping on their intricate conversations and endeavouring to decipher their functions. As patching involves multiple steps and consumes a significant amount of time, I often remain at my rig from noon until 7 pm. When I'm satisfied with the data I've collected and it has been a productive day, I clean my rig using flowing deionised water with ethanol and prepare for the experiments of the following day.

Once I arrive home, I take the time to prepare dinner and enjoy an episode of one of my favourite Netflix shows. Before wrapping up the day, I unwind by reading a chapter from my current book, allowing myself to decompress and relax.

- Can you shine some light on your research?

I specialise in the field of neuroscience called electrophysiology, which involves studying the electrical characteristics of biological cells and tissues in the nervous system. My research interests are exploring the underlying cellular mechanisms driving neurodevelopmental disorders (Rett syndrome) and neurodegenerative diseases (motor neurone disease or ALS).

Currently, my research focuses on the relationship between a specific group of neurons known as interneurons, which have an inhibitory effect, and a complex neurodevelopmental disorder called Rett syndrome (RTT). Rett syndrome is a severe and debilitating disorder that primarily affects girls. It is characterised by significant impairments in cognitive, motor, and social functioning. Approximately 95% of RTT cases are caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. Secondly, I am investigating the cellular properties of motor neurons expressing mutant forms of a gene, FUS, previously reported in patients with an aggressive form of motor neuron disease.

In both diseases, there is an inhibitory and excitatory imbalance. Inhibitory neurons play a crucial role in normal brain function and development. Within this group of neurons, there is significant variability, and it is not clear which specific subtypes contribute to neurological phenotypes. For instance, by deleting Mecp2 in certain subtypes of inhibitory neurons, we have observed partial impairment in the affected neurons in mouse models. Moreover, the affected subpopulations of inhibitory neurons in these mouse models exhibit distinct neurological features that are characteristic of RTT patients and do not overlap. However, we still lack understanding of how these neurons are affected at the cellular level.

My research involves using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to characterise the single-cellular properties of inhibitory neurons. The aim is to identify any differences in neuronal functions between mice that normally express Mecp2 and mice that either do not express Mecp2 or have a truncated version of it. If discrepancies are found, the next step is to explore whether these differences can be reversed to alleviate any of the debilitating symptoms observed in RTT patients.

- What other activities do you indulge in your free time?
During my leisure time, I engage in rowing. It was in 2021, coinciding with the start of my PhD program, that I first took up rowing, despite having no prior experience. This sport has been instrumental in establishing a disciplined routine with early morning starts. Given the intensity and occasional isolation of pursuing a PhD, rowing has played a vital role in maintaining my physical and mental well-being and fostering connections with friends.

In addition to rowing, I actively contribute to science communication efforts and hold the position of Social Media Coordinator for Women in Neuroscience UK (WiNUK). This involvement extends beyond a mere interest, as it allows me to merge my two passions: advocating for equity and promoting science. Through these endeavours, I aspire to create an inclusive space for women from diverse backgrounds within the male-dominated sphere of neuroscience. Furthermore, I have my own science communication platform‚Äîa personal blog and social media account‚Äîwhere I share my journey as a PhD student, highlight my research, and explore various captivating topics in neuroscience. Very soon, I will be launching my own Neuroscience Series, which delves into exciting advancements in the field. This creative outlet has proven to be immensely valuable, enabling me to delve deeper into my passion for science communication and emphasising the significance of effectively communicating scientific knowledge to the general public‚Äîan observation that became particularly evident during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Apart from my involvement in rowing and science communication, I have always nurtured a fondness for reading and writing since my early years. 

- Any advice you would like to give to other amateur researchers out there?

One valuable piece of advice I wish I had received when I embarked on my journey is the importance of embracing failure. Many individuals in academia have a history of being high achievers and perfectionists. However, as you progress further, the challenges become tougher. Engaging in scientific research and pushing the boundaries of knowledge is no easy task. Experiments often fail, requiring multiple repetitions before achieving success. Yet, this is an inherent part of the scientific process.

A significant lesson I've learned, and one that still poses occasional difficulties, is separating my self-worth from my research. Your worth as an individual is not determined by your failures, nor by the quantity of data you produce (despite academia often suggesting otherwise). It is vital to remember that you are a complete and deserving human being in your own right. Embracing failures, persevering in curiosity, and maintaining a willingness to learn are essential values to uphold.

I've know this man for almost 2 years. He's somewhat older than me and our personalities clash a little bit so we are more like surface level friends- I'm not entirely sure. We usually meet at a coffee shop a once or twice a month to talk about things (I'm being vague here since I want to avoid being too specific) but don't really hang out more and he doesn't seem interested in doing so. 

About 6 months ago, I told him it was my birthday and he got me a thoughtful gift. I asked when his birthday was and I made a mark on my calendar, but he's never mentioned it since. I've helped him out in other ways, etc, so overall we're even, but now it's up to me to choose whether to get him something for his birthday or not. 

It's a friendship that isn't getting stronger so I'm not entirely sure whether to get something, or how hard to try since I value being a 'good friend'. I'm not sure if we'll meet on his birthday, or if to bring it up.

1j8q4gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TomSgFit/comments/1j8q4gw/why_you_may_want_a_waterresistant_bluetooth/,"Why You May Want a ""Water-Resistant"" Bluetooth Headphone","Ever wondered why some headphones today are labeled as water-resistant? 

If you‚Äôve ever sweated through a workout, walked in the rain, or had the misfortune of dropping your earbuds in water, you probably understand the appeal. 

But what does ‚Äúwater-resistant‚Äù actually mean, and how much protection do these headphones really offer?

  


# What Does ""Water-Resistant"" Mean?

Water-resistant headphones are designed to withstand moisture to some degree, but not all are created equal. The level of protection is measured by the IP (Ingress Protection) rating, which tells you how well a device can resist dust and water.



**IPX4** ‚Äì Resistant to splashes and sweat; good for workouts and light rain.

**IPX5** ‚Äì Can handle stronger water jets (e.g., heavy rain).

**IPX7** ‚Äì Can be submerged in water (usually up to 1 meter for 30 minutes).

**IPX8** ‚Äì Built for deeper submersion (depends on manufacturer specifications).



# When You Need Headphones That Are Water-Resistant For Active Lifestyle

**Who Needs Water-Resistant Headphones?**

While water resistance is nice to have, it‚Äôs essential for certain situations:



‚úîÔ∏è **Fitness & Sports** ‚Äì Sweat can damage regular headphones over time. If you hit the gym or go for long runs, IPX4 or higher is ideal.



‚úîÔ∏è **Commuters & Outdoor Users** ‚Äì If you frequently walk or bike in unpredictable weather, water-resistant headphones offer peace of mind.



‚úîÔ∏è **Shower & Poolside Use** ‚Äì Some people love listening to music in the shower. If that‚Äôs you, IPX7 or higher is recommended.



‚úîÔ∏è **Accident-Prone Users** ‚Äì Ever spilled coffee on your desk? Dropped your earbuds in the sink? A little water resistance goes a long way.



**What Water-Resistance Can‚Äôt Do**

It‚Äôs important to remember that water-resistant ‚â† waterproof. Even with an IPX7 rating, your headphones aren‚Äôt designed for swimming unless explicitly stated. Also, water resistance can degrade over time, especially with exposure to saltwater or soap.



# Final Thoughts

If you‚Äôre someone who sweats a lot, exercises outdoors, or just wants extra durability, investing in water-resistant headphones  (An example is the [Jabra Elite 85H](https://brands.amazrock.com/product/jabra-elite-85h-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones/) \- Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones) is worth it. Just check the IP rating to ensure they meet your needs!



Do you use water-resistant headphones? Have they saved you from water damage before?

1j8q4fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1j8q4fa/one_of_the_most_crazymaking_things/,One of the most crazy-making things,"I think we can all agree that when it comes to narcs/covert narcs, we deal with tons of crazy-making behavior. I'd like to discuss one of the most crazy-making things.



Some background:

Soon-to-be-ex covert narc insists that he likes me and likes to spend time with me. Now, we tried to reconcile after his most recent move out back to Mommy's big house. He would let weeks go by without asking if we could get together. No visits. Nothing. And I am stuck at the house he discarded me in. We live in a rural area, and due to chronic illness, I can't drive very far.

CN also hates his mother but is happy to use her for free housing when I confront him about his ongoing lies and betrayals. She's not stupid. She knows CN actively avoids her. I feel for her because he does the same thing to me.

Getting to the point:

Here's the crazy-making part: CN will do anything to avoid me, or, on the rare occasion that he can stomach being in my presence, clock-watch, clearly counting down the seconds until he can leave. Or he'll make sure he has to do something shortly after he arrives. ""I need to go to the gym/store, etc.""

Here's the kicker. He can somehow, magically, mythically, spend entire weekends in close quarters with his sister for days on end. Sleeping at her house. Endless meals out, shopping trips, coffee, tea, late-night talks... and then do it all over again the next day. And the next. If he's with me and we talk for five minutes, he's ""cooked, tapped out, and has been communicating all day with people."" Somehow, he is never cooked or tapped out when having three long days of intense, close-up, face-to-face conversations with his sister.

He claims that as long as he TELLS me he likes me and likes to be around me, that's enough. Even if he chooses not to be around me and spends tons of close-up time with his sister instead.

So, yeah. I should listen to what he says and not what he does? No, thanks.",2,1741697895.0,NarcissisticSpouses,2,1.0,False

1j8q0xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/truenas/comments/1j8q0xl/backing_up_received_snapshots_from_other_servers/,Backing up *received* snapshots from other servers - clarity questions,"Hi all, I'm trying to get my head around zfs snapshots, replications, and TrueCloud/Storj. My objective is:

* protect against ""fat fingers"" on Debian/ZFS ""prod"" server: automated local snapshots of all datasets
* protect against ""coffee spilt on prod...kaboom"": automatic \*full\* replication (i.e. including snapshots) of all datasets on prod to a TrueNas server (called ""backup"") in a different room
* protect against ""house exploded"": ""backup"" TrueCloud's offsite to Storj
* keep things simple: ""backup"" is concerned with offsite DR so ""prod""'s concern is only sending it to ""backup""

NOTE: ""backup"" has additional datasets for other backups, e.g. TimeMachine, Windows Images etc.

This means I have a bunch of snapshots on datasets on ""prod"", replicated onto a dataset on ""backup"" (""backup/prod-backup"").

Pictorially, I will have something like:

* prod server
   * datasetA
      * snapshot1
      * snapshot2
   * datasetB
      * snapshot1
      * snapshot2
* backup server
   * timemachineDataSet
      * snapshot1
      * snapshot2
   * prod-backup
      * datasetA
      * datasetB

If I've understand it(!), that recovery is:

* ""fat fingers"" on ""prod"" server: restore from prod@latest-snapshot
* ""coffee spilt on prod...kaboom"": prod \`recv\`s the whole stream of all snapshots from backup/prod-backup
* ""house explodes"": restore ""backup"" from Storj (assumption), and then \`send\` backup/prod-snapshots back to ""prod""

For snapshot frequencies I'm thinking of something like:

* 1 weeks worth of snapshots every 15 minutes (7 \* 24 \* 15)
* 3 months worth of snapshots every 6 hours (3 \* 30 \*  4)
* 6 months worth of daily snapshots (6 \* 30)

\*ASSUMPTIONS\*:

* snapshots of snapshots isn't really a thing, i.e. a snapshot of ""backup/prod-backup"" doesn't magically include all snapshots sent from ""prod"". It's just a dataset on prod right? This means I should \*exclude\* backup from snapshotting the ""prod-backup"" dataset, as the snapshots on ""backup/prod-backup"" are created and managed by prod?
* restoring all snapshots from TrueCloud doesn't seem feasible? I've read the docs and it seems you can select a single snapshot, which, IIUI will \*not\* include the other snapshots that existed at that time. This means that the TrueCloud/Storj ""restoration"" is only ""files as they were"" and not ""files as they were including all snapshots""

Is this insanity? And how on earth do I go about calculating storage sizes!? I know snapshots are ""free""ish on ZFS, but when they are sent to Storj?

Ever find yourself staring at a monster of a to-do list, feeling like you‚Äôve just been handed a free ticket to ""Procrastination Station""? üöÇ You're not alone! We've all been there, overwhelmed by too many tasks and not enough *brain juice* to get through them all. But here‚Äôs a little secret I‚Äôve stumbled upon: **Time Blocking**. Trust me, it's a game-changer, and it's been saving me a whopping 10 hours a week. Want in on how it works? Buckle up! üé¢

**Why traditional to-do lists can be sneaky time-suckers:**
- **Endless Raccoon Holes:** Ever gotten caught in a task only to find out it's nibbling away at hours like a sneaky raccoon? Been there.
- **Decision Overload:** Too many tasks, too many decisions, and suddenly, you're drowning in a sea of indecision. Not cute.
- **Misaligned Energy:** Who here has tried to tackle a brain-draining task at 4 PM? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yeah, not the best timing.

**So, why time blocking is my superhero cape:**
1. **It honors your energy flow.** üöÄ Morning person? Block those crucial tasks before noon. Total night owl? Save the nitty-gritty for when you're buzzing.
   
2. **Mega focus mode activated.** Each block means one task at a time. That‚Äôs right, it forces you to break up with multitasking. Buh-bye, overwhelm!

3. **Intentional breaks.** Imagine chilling guilt-free with a coffee, knowing it‚Äôs scheduled! Yes, it's as amazing as it sounds.

4. **It turns stress into strategy.** Feel like you have your day *Mapped Out* (yes, with capitals), instead of surviving on the seat of your pants.

Here‚Äôs how I break it down:
- **Morning (High energy)**: Deep work/projects. This is when my brain's on fire! üî•
- **Midday (Dip time!)**: Admin tasks, emails, or a lil‚Äô walk. Nature appreciation moment, anyone?
- **Afternoon (Recharged)**: Creative work or meetings. Get social, brain, it‚Äôs go time!

**Want to try it out?** Start simple. Grab your calendar, and color code your blocks. Or just use a good ol‚Äô sticky note system ‚Äì whatever floats your boat. Over time, you'll get to know when your creativity peaks or when you can barely function. Plan around those personal rhythms like the amazing self-optimizer you are. ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And hey, I'm all for spontaneity. *Life happens*, and that‚Äôs okay. Sometimes you just gotta roll with the punches, right?

Curious if this could work for you too? Or have you tried something similar? Let's keep it going in the comments‚ÄîI‚Äôm all ears for your thoughts and tweaks.

‚ñ†Start‚ñ†



[A leaf falls from a tree and begins to flow in the wind going to The streets, to the pond, and the park, later starts flowing into Dell city where the story starts.]

(Welcome to my Story, Calamity)

[Location: Dell city] 
[Time: 12:30 AM]

Three punks (with there ages being near 18 - 21) in the City at night walking around talking and discussing about their lives

Punk 1: So then when I was working as the cashier, When the camera's weren't looking I decided to pocket the money from the cash register and take it home.

Punk 2: That's so smart I do when I'm at the cash register.

Punk 3: being at the cash register has its benefits huh?

Punk 1: (Laughs) Damn right it does. As long as the boss doesn't get suspicious of me I can keep doing this trick and get tons of money.

(As the punks continue talking, a little black cat girl appears from the corner of an alleyway humming a tune, Both groups bump into each other with punk 1 tripping upon the girl)

Punk 1: What the? HEY what's your deal Kid!

Cat girl: [Stays in silence]

Punk 2: hey you alright?

Punk 1: No, I'm not alright(Checks their phone) Damn it, I broke my phone when I hit the ground.

Punk 3: Damn that was a pretty expensive looking phone

Punk 1: IT WAS!

(As Punk 1 gets back up frustrated, they go over to the Cat girl, grabs her arm and tries to Scold her)

Punk 1: Listen you Idiot, Do you know how much phones like These cost in this world. HOW AM I GONNA REPLA-

(The Cat girl slaps the Punk knocking them back a little)

Cat girl: Don't touch me (Says menacingly)

Punk 1: Oh I'm gonna break your arm because of that kid.

(The story cuts to black and goes to another character who is in a totally different location)

[Location: Home]
[Time: 6:30 AM]

(Sounds of an alarm are rapidly beeping)

Jessie [The calico Cat]: (Morning grunt) There's no way it's already 6:30. (Groans) I guess It's time to get ready.

(Jessie gets dressed for work, as they get dressed. their husbands knock on the door.)

The man wife: Honey are you up

Jessie: Yes I'm up Mono, just getting ready for work is all.

Mono: Alrighty I just wanted to say that i'm gonna have to take you to work today

Jessie: Oh, for what?

Mono: we‚Äôre running low on food and i need to get groceries for dinner tonight

Jessie: Alright then I guess just hurry up and get ready.

Mono: But I woke up before and I'm already dressed?

Jessie: Okay then get the car started I'm just gonna grab some breakfast or at least whatever's left that i can eat.


[Jessie goes to the kitchen and find her two kids]

Jessie: Good morning Milo and Ollie what are you two doing?

Milo: Ollie here is trying to make you breakfast for work. But unfortunately  there is nothing in the fridge to make you.

Ollie: Hold up, I wouldn't say nothing just yet.
[Ollie hands Jessie a peanut butter sandwich in a zip lock bag]

Jessie: Why‚Äô thank you Ollie, but why only peanut butter sandwich.

Milo: Well..[Milo holds up a clearly expire jelly jar]

Jessie: I can see why your dad wants to go to the store so early..

Milo: Yeah.

Jessie: [Heads to the front door to leave] Anyway I'm off to work, you to be good and to tomfoolery okay?

Milo: Mom, come on. I'm 17. Do you think I'm still into tomfoolery?

Jessie: Just making sure. [Leaves the house]

Milo & Ollie:[Silence]

Milo: You wanna do something stupid.

Ollie: Mom literally just said no tomfoolery 

Milo: you're right She said no ""Tomfoolery"" but my name is Milo so it's Milofoolery.

{Location Dell city}
{Time: 7:20 Am}
[While Mono and Jessie are in the car they‚Äôve reach dell city but unfortunately its they run into a traffic jam]

Jessie: You have got to be kidding me

Mono: I know, A traffic jam this early? 

{Jessie checks her watch and sees the time}

Jessie: Damn, I only have 25 minutes to get to work before I'm late. I'll just hop off here and run Okay?

Mono: Okay stay safe honey [Kiss Jessie] 

Jessie: Yea whatever see yea sweetie. Pick me up at 6pm okay.

Mono: okay.

{Jessie hops off the car and starts running to work} 

[Jessie continues running in the city until she spots 3 victims of what seems to be a  crime scene]

Jessie: Woah what happened here?

Officer: Woah, stand back madam,
Don't you see the Caution tape?

Jessie: Oh my bad. What happened here are they dead and what happened to that light post?

[Light post is tilted when it's not supposed to be]

Officer: It looks like 3 bystanders were brutally cut and knocked out by someone and for the light post it looks like one of the victim's head was bashed onto the light post, they aren't dead but they're just really torn up. We're not sure what happened here. There gonna be taken to the hospital and be asked questions there.

Nurse 1: Yep and we're gonna drain their bank acc- I mean Nurse them back to health.

Nurse 2: [Whispers to nurse 1] Then drain the money from there accounts right?

Nurse 1:[Whispers back] Of course.

Nurse 2: [cheers]

Jessie: Well, can I get by? I'm gonna be late for work?

Officer: What? no we're still in the middle of this investigation if you want to get past you need to go a different route.

Jessie: Damn it, Fine I'll go another route.

[Jessie goes another route so she won't be late for work]

[After a while she finally was able to reach the building she works at]


[Location Dell city centre]
[Time: 7:43 Am]

Jessie: [Catches breathe] finally, with just a few seconds to spare.

[As Jessie was walking into the building she sees a Cat girl Roaming around the garbage can and finds a very dirty burger]

Jessie: WOAH, Hey Kid Stop.

[Jessie rushes over to the Cat girl and grabs her wrist and stops her from eating that burger]

Cat Girl: [Shocked from being grabbed so suddenly]

Jessie: HEY WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HAVEN'T YOUR PARENTS EVER TOLD YOU NOT TO EAT FROM THE TRASH?

[The Cat girl gets angry and looks like there about to attack]

Jessie: wait. [Jessie observes the Cat girl]
Dirty clothes, Unwashed hair, bad smell, oh this kid is homeless. Wait just a moment kid
[Jessie reaches something in her purse]

[The Cat girl not liking being touched, She looks like she's about to attack Jessie]

Jessie: [Pulls out the sandwich that Ollie made] Here, this is better than that dirty burger I can tell you that.

[The Cat girl a little shocked from the offer she takes the sandwich] 

[The Cat girl eats the sandwich]

Jessie: Wow you must like that sandwich.

[The Cat girl continues eating the sandwich until they realize that almost ate it all]

[After realizing they almost finished it they hurry leave the area quickly, but before they leave they say something to Jessie]

Jessie: Why do you always have a problem with me? Out of everyone in this building that works here in Red Ink, I seem to have a special place in your heart that you tolerate.

Pacifica: I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. 

[A worker comes into the building late]

Random worker: Sorry I'm late 

Pacifica: Huh? yea it's fine

Tom: Are you serious?

Jessie: [Cracks knuckles] Lord please give me the patience to not smack this bitches ass.

[Pacifica leaves and does her job at managing people poorly.]

Jessie: [Still pissed]


Tom: Don't let her get you down Jessie. 

Jessie: [Sighs] let's just get the day started.

[As the day goes on Pacifica makes Jessie's day horrible by putting hot coffee on her table without a coaster, turning off Jessie's computer when she was working on a paper when she was almost finished. it didn't save]

Mono: Cereal, Milk, Turkey, Candy, Candy. Why is candy written on the list so much? Whatever I guess I could give the kids what they want, [Continues walking down the aisles]

[As Mono walks thru the store he keeps hearing 2 sets of footsteps behind him]

[Mono being a little curious he turns around and sees nobody behind him]

Mono: huh, for a second I thought somebody was right behind me,

Fox 1: What why me? You‚Äôre usually the thief outta the 3 of us

Fox 2: Well you gotta learn how to steal one day. This skill will be helpful in the future. Now go on and steal that man's wallet.

Fox 1: Okay okay, just give me a second.

Mono: Don't patronize me Milo, And No I'm not joking. Those foxes were slick and fast. 

Ollie: Faster than you? 

Mono: Yea apparently. They stole my wallet in the store and when I was chasing them I lost them. I lost the 500 dollars In Cash for the groceries and my credit cards.

Jessie: Okay, tomorrow cancel the cards and report the loss. Right now you need sleep. It looks like you've been in rough shape today.

Fox 2: I feel great actually. Come on, the plan is still in motion.

[Fox 1 and 2 escape into the city]
[The cat girl saw all this happen in the distance, they seem a bit mad]

Jessie: No, No, No. Ahhh How am I gonna explain this to the Manager? ‚ÄúHey I got beat by 2 baby foxes and I lost the documents you handed me‚Äù uhh [Calms down and thinks] maybe I can ask her for forgiveness and ask her for more time.

[Jessie enter the Red Ink building]
[Jessie greets Tom this morning]

Jessie: Hi, Tom.. have you seen Pacifica I need to talk to her.

[Tom seems to be very nervous when Jessie entered the building . Tom looks at Jessie then looks at the clock like he is Signalling something?]

Jessie: Is something wro- [She looks at the clock and realized she's 5 minutes late to work]
Ohh you gotta be fuc-

Pacifica: 5 minutes late.  

Jessie: Look I know how this looks, but I ran into trouble.

Pacifica: is that an empty briefcase. Hmm Seems like you have since you don't have the 400 documents I requested.

Jessie: They got blown in the wind. If you just give me more time

Pacifica: I gave you a reasonable amount of time and yet you still failed this task. Jessie, you used to be a great employee here at Red ink. But you're no longer in your prime. Maybe it's time to toss in the towel darling.
I'm sorry to say but your fired [Says the sorry but they aren't]

Jessie: fired.. [Heart sank]

Tom: Wait.

[Both Jessie and and Pacifica look at Tom]

Tom: Give Jessie a bit more time, I know she can get you those documents.

Pacifica: What makes you say that?

Tom: Well Jessie is the reason why I have this job in the first place. And She's been working non stop to provide for her family, and she'll keep doing so till the end of time. 
I'm confident in her abilities. just give her a second chance please.

Pacifica: ‚Ä¶ Fine, I'll give you till the end of the day to find those documents. If those documents aren't on my table at the end of the day then, then well.. you get the picture [Begins to leave]

Jessie: No point, Even with the 3 of us we only found 80 documents that just so happen to be in the city. It's over, I've lost my job.

[Somebody comes inside the fast food restaurant, That somebody goes to the table Jessie is sitting at and hands them something, hands them the documents]

Jessie: What the?

Tom: these are the remaining documents 

Mono: All 320 of them?

[Jessie looks at the person with handed the documents and sees that it's the Homeless cat girl she gave the sandwich two]

Jessie: It's you. [Says shockingly]

Mono: You know this little girl?

Jessie: ‚Ä¶ When I was running to work I met this girl as she was rummaging around in a trash can, I gave her a peanut butter sandwich and she went on her merry way. I don't know why she felt the need to collect the documents though
[Takes the documents from Emily]

Emily: [Looks at both Mono and Jessie] I-

Jessie: Hmm?

Mono: Huh

Emily: [Deep Sighs] I'm sorry for the trouble they have caused.

[Fox 1 and Fox 2 pop out]

Mono: HEY It's Them

[Emily hands Mono his wallet]

Mono: Huh my wallet? [Grabs it]

Emily: You lost your 500 dollars right? Don't worry they didn't spend anything. 

[Mono Check his wallet to see if she's telling the truth]

Emily: I've told them they shouldn't steal from others but I guess they didn't want to listen. What do you 2 have to say for yourselves 

Fox 1: We're sorry Emily. We've been on the street for so long. We haven't had good food in a while.

Fox 2: We just wanted a taste of something good okay?

Emily: [Still mad but understands their feelings] I understand you're tired but you almost cost these people there home? You would have made them homeless as well? 
Do you really want that on your conscience?

Fox 1 & 2: No..

Mono: Wait You 3 are all homeless? But you 3 look so young. Where are your parents?

[A moment of silence]

Fox 1: Well our parents gave up us for adoption. but nobody wanted us, and Emily.. 

Emily: ‚Ä¶ They're gone.

[Silence]

Emily: we've been homeless for a while now, it's just how it is.

[Mono and Jessie look at each other]

Jessie: Tom can you take these documents and place them on the manager desk I have ‚ÄúFamily matter to take care of‚Äù

Tom: ‚ÄúFamily matters?‚Äù [Looks at Emily] Oh I understand. I will take care of it for you.

[Tom leaves to deliver the documents]

Mono: [Looks at Fox 1] You stole my wallet because you wanted a decent meal right?

Fox 1: [Scared] Yes..

Mono: Well Let me treat you to one.

[Both foxes' ears perk up and smile while Emily is a bit shocked. The foxes are given burgers and they start Devouring the food]

Jessie: I don't think they're chewing, I think they're just inhaling the food.

Fox 2: [Starts choking]

What advice could you give?,"My boyfriend (24) and I (23) have been together for over a year and I know he‚Äôs been wanting to propose. He‚Äôs the man I want to marry. Our only problem is that my parents do not seem to respect him or I. 

I‚Äôm in a strange situation where my mom has never treated me like a daughter but more like an associate or friend. She has never respected me or has tried to make me look good in front of my boyfriend. The first time he met my parents my mom laughed and told him ‚ÄúI was a bad communicator‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf this doesn‚Äôt work she knows some girls that would snatch him right up‚Äù. This is only the tip of the iceberg of the things she has done and said. Let‚Äôs not forget that she openly discusses she wants to divorce my dad and has always talked about it to me since I was 11. My boyfriend‚Äôs parents even told him I shouldn‚Äôt even be living in this house with people like this after he told them all the things they‚Äôve done. 

The thing that really concerns him is that he want to ask my dad for permission to marry me but my dad doesn‚Äôt even try to have serious conversations with him. He doesn‚Äôt try to take him out for coffee or lunch to discuss dating me and to ask my boyfriend questions. I‚Äôm afraid he would never try to sit down and talk to anyone trying to date me. My dad acts like he just doesn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm the only daughter and oldest of two. I feel horrible for my boyfriend and I just want my family‚Ä¶ my own flesh and blood‚Ä¶ to make him feel welcome and I want them to be concerned about who I am quite literally and very possibly marrying. 

Who has ever been in this kind of situation? What do I even tell my sweet boyfriend? That he shouldn‚Äôt expect to much out of my parents? Should I warn him that he may never get a loving set of inlaws? 

I‚Äôm converting to become Catholic and I know my parents didn‚Äôt respect me before knowing he was even catholic. I‚Äôm devastated about this whole situation and I just want them to care and I‚Äôm scared it will scare him into not proposing. He deserves better inlaws",2,1741696649.0,CatholicConverts,2,1.0,False
1j8pnmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkAngel/comments/1j8pnmi/differences_between_the_unaired_pilot_and_the/,Differences between the Unaired Pilot and the Final Version.,"First off, big thanks to u/Pullhitter for posting the link to the unaired pilot. Much appreciated!

There are numerous little editing differences between the Unaired Pilot (UP) and the Final Version (FV), most of which I won't list if they are just a half-second here or there.

Different typeface for title card.

Different score in multiple scenes.

No titles for Gillette Wyoming, 2009 on UP.

Jondy says ""Max!"" on screen in FV but not in UP.

The Max under the ice reveal is different. In the UP, the shot from above zooms in until we see that Max was directly under where Lydecker was standing. The hole Max fell through can be seen off to one side.  In the FV, (no visible hole to the side) partway through the zoom we cut to a panning shot that reveals Max several feet away in the opposite direction to where she went through.

The UP dissolves from young Max to old Max but does not use a morph the way the FV does.

The first shot of Max on the Needle is different footage in both. She wears gloves in the FV but not the UP. The second shot is the same, no gloves. So Max must have quickly taken them off in the FV when we weren't looking. ;)

No onscreen actor and crew credits for UP.

Different shot of Max in the hallway of her building. 

In the UP, Normal yells over the Eyes Only line ""smiling at fundraisers"", in the FV his line comes afterwards.

The Eyes Only broadcast also has different graphic overlays, far fewer in the UP than the FV.

The hover drone Max sees is an updated shot in the FV. Same background, new drone.

The entire subplot about Sketchy's two girlfriends is missing from the UP.

The scene where Max complains about Kendra's underwear on her bike is completely reshot. Even the underwear she holds up is different. (White in the FV, black in the UP, just FYI.) Kendra shows more skin in the FV. The UP does not have the revelation that Max spits in Walter's coffee every day.

Different insert shot of Max's ID when Logan is asking Normal about her. 

At Crash, OC's dialogue is briefly different (due to the missing Sketchy subplot)	

UP: ""About time you hung that Darren out to dry.""	

FV: ""Friends don't help other friends cheat.""

UP is also missing OC's line, ""I say hang Sketchy out to dry. Let Natalie see him for the heel he is. Then, maybe she'll step to the all-girl team."" and Max replying, ""Of course there's nothing self-serving in that scenario."" The UP has a looped line from Max to cover the cut, ""I just don't go in with any expectations.""

The VFX footage of the hover drone seen after Max and Logan's walk 'n talk is different.

When Vogelsang gets attacked, the UP is missing a small piece when he first walks back into the laundromat. 

After Logan confronts Max with what he knows, the UP has a scene where Max sells the idol.

After Vogelsang talks to Max outside, they go back inside and briefly continue the ruse that she is investigating her fianc√©.

Slightly different editing/footage when Max is surprised by Theo's son when she returns home.

When Max visits an unconscious Logan in the hospital, the UP has an extra line (audio only, probably looped) from Max, ""Looks like you pissed off the wrong folks.""

When Max sees Bruno out the window, the UP has no visual effect for her POV.

Slightly different editing when the explosion goes off as Max leaves with Logan.

The UP does not have the brief moment when Max tries to stand up from being searched and being pushed back down and Bruno searching her bag.

Some small editing differences during Max and Bruno's little scrimmage at the motel.

When Max calls Vogelsang at the motel, the footage of Max's side of the conversation is different in the two versions.

The UP is missing the very end of the scene when Theo's remains are delivered, when Max says ""I'll make sure his family gets this.""

The final scene with Logan and Max is a completely different shoot. The UP is set two months later as opposed to the three months of the FV. 

The scripted lines are mostly the same, with a couple of exceptions.

Max and Logan are both are dressed differently in each version.

Logan's wheelchair is revealed to the audience earlier in the UP.

The box with the idol in it is different in each version.

The guy Logan needs help with looks different in the two versions. 

The guy's job is different too. A deputy coroner in one, a harbor master in the other.

Max cries during the scene in the UP.

The photos of Zack are very different but appear to be the same actor. Just that he's been artificially aged-up in the UP version.

The end credits are different and incomplete in the UP.



Watching the quality of the Unaired Pilot, I'm reminded that while we don't have Dark Angel in HD, I'm grateful we have a proper release at all. If we were reduced to TV recordings from back in the day it would really suck.

Also, I have a boyfriend which knows all about what happened between us and he said if I ever want to meet up with my ex for a coffee, he would allow me to as long as I told him beforehand. 

The thing is, I kind of at least used to want some closure as to why he acted that strange, but just got over it as I feel like no closure is enough and just shows how little he cared about me. 

I‚Äôm kind of curious what he wants to talk about and what his intentions are with meeting up. He knows I have a boyfriend now, so I don‚Äôt think he wants to do something like that.

I‚Äôve recently had a gastric bypass (3.5 mths post op) due to digestive system issues. I am yet to see the psychiatrist again about how to take my Vyvanse and a med review, the hospital staff told me I must take this on an empty stomach however I was trying to take this with protein yoghurt each morning before my surgery for a short time and would take around 5:30/6am. I definitely feel that this worked well, but would need my dex around 12-2 as a top up as prescribed. Now I take my medication at 7:30/7:45am as I struggle very hard to get up in the morning as I am so tired,and it works a while but I really struggle to eat breakfast as I am simply not interested nor hungry, just my coffee. The thought of eating is a hard no tbh. It sometimes makes me feel nauseous though if I don‚Äôt have coffee quick enough. 

What has worked well for others with gastric bypass?

Need help.","To make a very long story as short as possible, I‚Äôve had debilitating ADHD and OCD symptoms for many years now. I‚Äôm on an antidepressant which makes the OCD manageable but my ADHD is out of control. My biggest problem is that I do not respond (at all) to almost any substances including prescribed ADHD meds. I‚Äôm talking coffee, nicotine, stimulants, weed, kratom, benzos‚Ä¶ i‚Äôve tried many. This specific problem of not feeling these substances started after I took an antipsychotic short term for my severe OCD. Before that, coffee, weed and so on definitely had an effect on me and my productivity. My theory is that the introduction of the psychiatric medication somehow messed with my genes because I am out of answers. 

According to Genetic Genie my methylation is affected with a 67% decrease. 

My blood test results are as follows 

Active B12 - 112.4 ¬µg/L
B2 - 181.24 ¬µg/L
Folate - 8.0 ng/mL 
Zinc - 8.4 ¬µmol/L (gonna supplement) 
Magnesium - 0.77 mmol/L
Homocysteine is a little high at 19.0 umol/L. 

So I don‚Äôt have any major deficiencies in these areas, if I‚Äôm understanding correctly.

I have slowly incorporated 400mcg of Methylfolate but not getting any major results apart from the first few days where I felt productive, alert and in good mood albeit I had a lot of anxiety. Should I go up with the dosage? 

I‚Äôm planning to supplement Vitamin D (I‚Äôve always been deficient) Zinc & Choline along with the Methylfolate (according to Choline Calculator, I need 8 eggs worth of Choline but not sure how much to supplement because I barely eat eggs.) 

I‚Äôve added my genes below. I‚Äôd appreciate any help as this is really affecting my academic and social life.

This morning I poked my bf in his side (we are both very ticklish) because he was on his phone scrolling. Instead of his usual playful reaction, he barked at me to stop it. His tone scared me a little, it was full of annoyance and even some anger. 

I can‚Äôt stand aggressive men. My father was choleric, he would just scream and scream at every little inconvenience. My bf has never said a word to me in that tone, quite contrary, he is like a cuddle bear, sweet and gentle and his presence alone calms me. I think that‚Äôs why I like him so much. 

I turned away from him, I was upset. He didn‚Äôt notice (or care?) and kept scrolling.

A few moments passed, I just stood up and got dressed (he didn‚Äôt notice me changing in front of him). He asked me, what I was doing. I said I was going to make coffee and head back to my place, I‚Äôve got stuff to do and he has too. I just felt so stupid laying right next to him, waiting for him to grant me a sliver of his attention. We had coffee mostly in silence.

He walked me to my train station (usually I have to ask him to, this time he just started putting on his shoes when I did and went along) and we talked. I told him how stupid I felt and that I frankly have better things to do. I‚Äôm not mad and we will see each other later if he asks me to in time, not when it‚Äôs already dark because lately that has also been bothering me. I‚Äôm not a booty call you can call when you‚Äôre already in bed and notice something is missing.

He was very understanding and showed remorse for not noticing how this made me feel, but right before I got on my train, he said ‚Äúwhat a way to start off the day‚Äù, it just ticked me off. He can‚Äôt turn this on me, these are the consequences of his actions. I don‚Äôt have to just sit there and take it. I feel like a bitch, but I also want to be in a relationship where we both care for each other, not just me for him.

I‚Äôm trying to understand his reaction from earlier. A few minutes before I poked him he had a phone call from work. He is in the military and a subordinate needed something. I know he is very different at work, I am fine with that, as long as he doesn‚Äôt talk to me the way he does to his soldiers, because I‚Äôm not, I am his partner.

so our relationship is a bit complicated and unusual, let me explain:

* we are both from religious backgrounds and decided to ""get married"" while barely having gone on a couple of coffee dates, mainly because we liked each other enough to ""give it a go"" and this way we could continue seeing each other with no pressure from family
* our relationship has been mainly long distance (we live in different countries), and this has made it tough to actually get to know each other properly.
* in the last two years, we have probably spent a total of about a month or two together face-to-face (I know thats crazy). Other than that, we video call eachother like once a week, and txt regularly
* im pretty sure she is ""into me"", and im also sure that im way more into her right now (this doesnt bother me too much, but I hope this improves once we are actually together)
* tbh our txting and calls recently has been bad, we are going through a loop where I call her in a serious tone to say we are not communicating enough, then for that week she will txt me everyday to prove to me we are good, and then we go back to poor communication and only txting the minimum (like a routine instead of actually wanting to talk to each other)
* there is only one topic which I genuinely disagree with her and it's making me reconsider things...I was said from the beginning we need to be transparent and honest with each other about everything, the hardest part of this is probably sharing our intimate past with other partners. I have made a point of laying out everything from my past to her (while I was telling her, I could tell she wasn't focused and probably worried about when its her turn). So far, she has given me small bits of info, and from what she has told me, there are a couple of ""bomb truths"" which she has admitted she doesn't wanna tell me cause she is scared I will leave her. I think the bomb is that she has slept with her ex, which wouldn't make me leave, but it will annoy me if she doesn't tell me that before the wedding.

At this stage, the wedding is 6 months away, and realistically we are not gonna see each other face-to-face until the wedding, and our relationship is no where near what I was hoping it would be like at this stage (she feels the same way). I feel we should both be head over heels for each other and just wishing the wedding would come sooner and talk about what we will be like with each other, but our convos are usually more bland and boring than that, typically just talking about our day and anything eventful. Even though I am more in love with her than she is with me, Im a realist and I know that we may be heading into a disaster (aka early divorce). Even though she admits that she agrees with everything I am worried about (all the stuff I listed above and more), she thinks we will be fine and blindly believes that things will change for the better after the wedding. To me, this is wishful thinking.

I mean, being together physically after the wedding will obviously change the dynamic of our relationship (hopefully for better, theres a chance it gets worst!), but intimacy aside, it's more important to me that we connect emotionally and become a couple that trust each other completely. Its already tough enough to make the long-distance relation work, we dont need to be avoiding or hiding things from each other.

So, i've decided today, instead of calling her and having a nice positive convo about our day etc, Im gonna tell her straight up that I don't feel great about our relationship right now, and it's messing with me a lot. Also, I think I should give her an ultimatum about telling me about her ""crazy past"", and make a point that it's very shady and unfair to keep stuff from me until after we are married (I have said directly before that if she tells me something that would make me want to leave her, that would happen regardless of if we are married or not).

Am I being too blunt / too honest here? Theres also a case to be made that it is not the right time (a few months before the wedding) to bring this up, but I would rather put my feelings and thoughts out there and see where we go from there. I have even thought that maybe we should take a ""break"" from having to txt/call each other for a couple of weeks, just so we can focus on ourselves and not have the pressure of having to txt each other everyday, etc. Even if the result is we become further apart, I would rather this happens now rather than later into our marriage.
