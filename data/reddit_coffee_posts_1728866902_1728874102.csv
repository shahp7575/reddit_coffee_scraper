The thing is I think I’ve already had it for a few weeks because I started getting random tired spells like 2-3 weeks ago and then last week I got a sore throat and it got a bit worse so I went in and they tested me for mono which turned out to be positive. The thing is though, they told me they needed 5 people to check the tests because it was very hard to tell in my case if I was positive or negative and they eventually concluded that i am positive. So could this mean I already had it for a few weeks now? So far nothing crazy just feel a bit more tired than usual ( nothing a coffee or 2 could fix) and recently the sore throat. Also they prescribed me steroids but I don’t think I’m going to take them because I heard you can get a full body rash which is something I would not like.",1,1728873941.0,Mononucleosis,1,1.0,False

1g36alu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClubPenguin/comments/1g36alu/new_to_cpj_heres_some_things_to_know/,New to CPJ? Here's some things to know!,"First of all, welcome and hello! I thought I'd explain a few things that I wish I understood sooner when I was a new player back in April of this year. Here's some helpful tips if you're new to CPJ, or if it's just been forever since you played the original. I haven't done any other CPPS since Rewritten, so if some of this is standard across all platforms, my bad.

[This is the fandom wiki](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Club_Penguin_Journey_Wiki) for CPJ! They keep a list of current active item-unlocking codes on the right-side of the page, as well as current pins and their locations. This is also where you can find info on specific items, like when they were available, or what happened in past parties.  
As there was a biiiiig rework during the shutdown, we'll all be seeing what has changed about CPJ in the coming days/weeks. Things you should know from before the shutdown (which are subject to change):

* This is supposed to be a kid-friendly game! The chat filter is not just for typical profanity, sometimes it will stop you from saying things because they could be bullying. I haven't found it a massive inconvenience myself. Sometimes you gotta break out the Thesaurus, y'know. It's not going to kill you.
* The CPJ staff often makes items that are new to Club Penguin. Sometimes they are recolors of shirts or outfits, sometimes they are handheld stuffed animals, sometimes they are a thingy that makes you a [snow tractor instead of a penguin](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Snowcat). This is cool as hell. You can see them all [here](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Custom_Items).
* [Stamps ](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Island_Life_Stamps#Activities)are a big deal! Some penguins try to collect them all. They mark your progress and achievements on the island, and earning all stamps for a particular mini-game will permanently double the coin payout while playing it! Some stamps are party-exclusive, some come from meeting mascots, and some can only be earned by working together with other penguins. They can be viewed in your Stamp Book, the cover of which can be decorated with any stamps or pins you find.
* You can earn coins by playing Club Penguin minigames, or by mining in the Mines. You can ALSO earn coins by mining on the Iceberg (but perhaps not during The Fair, unsure) or by working at the Coffee Shop or the Pizza Parlor! [More about those jobs here](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Jobs). You can also earn a few stamps doing jobs.
* During a party, there will ""Party Stamps"" as well as the ""Quest Log."" This can get a bit confusing as most people refer to the Quests Log goals as ""stamps,"" but finishing them will not add a stamp to your stamp book. Party Stamps can be seen in your stamp book, while Quests can be seen if you click the blue hexagon button in the top right with a ! inside.
* Finishing as many Quests as possible during a party is often a **high priority** for players. These Quests are only active during that given party, and the reward for finishing each Quest is a varying amount of red Gems based on how difficult the quest is. These Gems can be spent on the illustrious [Captain Crimson](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Crimson)'s ship in exchange for older exclusive items that are highly sought-after. Though you could earn Gems during any party since April Fools 2024, Captain Crimson made his first appearance for only 4 days in September of 2024. Spending those Gems was convoluted and weird and everyone hated it so they decided during the shutdown that when he comes back, it'll be entirely different. Yay!
* IF YOU SEE A WEIRD-LOOKING LOW-POLY PENGUIN, IT'S [THIS ITEM](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Experimental_Penguin). Try not to let the jealousy drive you to madness.",2,1728873662.0,ClubPenguin,0,1.0,False

Sorry for the pause, things have been getting…. A little hectic as it were, I’ll try to cover it when I can but for now actions are still taking place. So in the interim… Time for another trip down memory lane: Louisiana. I want to say this was well into my second year with PEXU nearing the three year mark, time gets convoluted as a government sponsored disposable- dozens of missions a month, target packages the world can never see beginning to pile up in the back of my house figuratively and my mind literally as the weight of everything began to settle and press down onto my shoulders and soul. I can’t tell you the amount of early morning or late nights, running off adrenaline and caffeine, marching off to every corner of the states and globe. One week in South Korea, the next headed to Canada to deal with something that came from Northern Michigan, the next? Well let’s just say something was lurking within the smoke of a large forest fire and harvesting all those who ventured in to stop the flames. 

Honestly I think I was going insane… to be fair I probably am, though functionally at the very least. Worst was everytime I came home… it was feeling less and less safe. A good example was when I woke up one morning and decided to make myself a cup of coffee, honestly that was what probably did it: a bad omen. Anyways it was heading into the fall of that year so I could feel the cold of the rockies seeping through the windows. I went out to take a look out on my porch… and I saw them: birds. I live in an extremely rural area, shit with some of the installations I made on my house I’m practically off the grid, animals are to be expected…. But not the nearly 200 dead birds I saw laying around the front of my house. All of them were backs to the soil, eyes wide and to the sky, wings and legs curled up like a wave of death hit them. 

I nearly dropped my coffee and backed in, holding my breath as the first thing that came to mind was some sort of pathogen and chemical agent. The Blackwood Brotherhood targeting PEXU operatives on their home turf though minimal… was not uncommon. The unit sent some people out and “analysis” showed that… there wasn’t any sensible cause of death. Legitimately it was like they just stop, dropped, and died from what the shrink said, is “shrink” the right word? Lab Tech? Well they’re deep into animal science and forensics and-... I’m rambling. Point is it was damn near impossible to even see they were dead until necrosis set in.  

What’s worse… I don’t think it’s the cult. Like I said in a previous entry, things have been weird around here… more handprints have been appearing around my property: approximately 250 meters from my house is a woodline across the field, on an old oak that’s got more rings than most countries got decades on this earth… was another handprint, this one was gaunt, elongated fingers that burned a good centimeter into the tree. Another one similarly appeared on my rain duct, like someone had attempted to climb it, though further inspection of the roof showed no more. I know what this was, the same thing the Muj and Taliban did: sizing up, probing for weaknesses. I went back inside and kept my rifle loaded, I wasn’t going to blink first. 

I was almost overjoyed when I got the call from Montgomery about my next op, although I didn’t know the madhouse I was walking into. You see the things we’re largely in combat with can’t always just be shot, they’re incomprehensible and primordial, and while we were regularly in the trenches against Situation Whiskeys, terrors in Appalachia, and fighting a conspiracy… sometimes we’re up against things that warp the world itself. 

...

**Dossier: Louisiana Umbra** 

Oh man, where do I begin with this one. Well in short I was being assigned to an area deep in central Louisiana, rich in voodoo and black magic, so much so that place is stained and plenty of occult experts would tell you you don’t fuck around. I wasn’t just fucking around, I was being told to rappel down and start kicking. Ever since Katrina, there’s a large amount of back roads areas in Louisiana that just haven’t recovered, infrastructure and basic necessities are constantly faltering, quality of life is lower than some third world states. It’s bad and the town in question was more or less forgotten about by the local country. The town’s population had been decreasing every since reports of “loved ones” returning and wandering the streets started to occur. At first it was a handful, then entire houses started turning up empty… the local police station was so undermanned, underfunded, under-everything they were neglected. 

All signs pointed to something… something had been harvesting these people, in an area where the veil between our realm and the other side thinned, something had crawled it’s way onto our side and it got passed to PEXU… and assigned to me. Terrific. Worst part was that was it, in Montgomery’s own words: “I wish we could provide you with more, but we’re down on manning and we can’t confirm what the nature of the situation is. We’ll have you on ISR every second… call me if you need me”. 

I can’t say I was all too pleased to be going to a backroads swamp town nestled in black magic alley that was slowly being devoured by something. I can’t also say I had to front my own transportation on this one meaning it was a crispy 20 hour drive. What I will say is it gave me plenty of time to think about everything… my mind drifted back to the events that led me here, my time in 10th mountain and the four deployments from hell. I think it was while passing through Oklahoma that I saw something that shook me to my core. It was this out in the literal middle of flat lands nowhere, past a native rez just a few klicks, I’m buying some fuel for the road when the cashier hands me back my change. Gold wrist band, logo of the “New Advent” written on it. 

I sped the fuck out of there. This guy had to have not left his zip code in the last 20 years, this place barely had a power line and yet… there he was wearing that wrist band. So many people were… I saw a few at the airport when I flew out to Korea, Canada, even Germany. A pit grew in my stomach, the world we knew was slowly being consumed by something… time was running out and I feared the brass didn’t have the manpower to stop it. I still don’t, and I was right. Things got real weird when I had passed the state border into Louisiana, groggy and tired. I pulled into a rest stop and caught some winks.

The dream I had was… weird, like vividly weird, I remember feeling shit in the dream, tasting stuff: the cold of my AC back at my house, my sheets, the disgusting taste in my mouth. I woke up in my own bed… actually I was sure the entire drive was the dream, a hallucination brought on by sleep deprivation. So much so when I glanced around I felt the world come back, I remember rubbing my temples before I heard it. “Dwight” a female voice, someone I remember… She was an old friend of mine, a colleague who helped me before I joined Pexu: “Rosanne”. I couldn’t mistake that British accent anywhere, and it sounded real… the echo, down the hall. I looked at the closed door, unable to talk… my lips wouldn’t move, I tried to get up but I couldn’t. “Dwight…” she said again, no inflection in her voice… the warning signs in my head were tripping as the door just pushed open.

There she was… tan skin, dark hair hanging over a seat of wide eyes with needle irises. I could feel my entire body panic as she sprinted towards me, eyes as gold as the New Advent’s banners, face contorted into pure hatred. 

I snapped away so hard in the driver seat of my Rav4 my chest hit the steering wheel causing me to cringe. “Mother…. Fucker…” I said, yeah, caffeine nightmares are a trip. Though… honestly? I… I don’t know. You ever forget someone’s voice till you hear it again, so much has happened. I had forgotten Rosanne’s tone until I heard it there, hadn’t thought about it in literal years and… something had drawn those memories back out. I looked at the clock… a hardy 30 minutes had elapsed since I went to sleep, eh good enough I suppose. 

Pulling into the area several hours later let me know the kind of shit I was getting into: dense forests that were still cold and humid from the previous storms surrounded either side of the interstate like an impermeable wall. All along the way there were overgrown shacks, rusted out cars, vehicles abandoned, some turned over… road signs hanging off wood poles that pointed towards roads that had long since been abandoned- Yep, this was central Louisiana alright. The town in question had seen better days and that was at least somewhat alarming as it had been a while since the epicenter hit this place, and yet… power lines were still sheared and hanging, no sparks meant they were dead, windows broken, entire sections of house walls falling off. People still walked the streets, off in the distance before disappearing behind corners. 

It was broad daylight, and yet seemed as dead as it would in the pitch dark.

You could almost see the slight dark mist hanging over it, a weird flicker at the edge of your eye. This wasn’t inhabited by us anymore, something else had made this its lair. 

First point of contact was the police station in town, and well… Yeah I’m just gonna go ahead and say it, I didn’t even think it was the actual police station. It was a small, 10 by 10 meter concrete square building on the corner bordering a small lot full of gravel, rocks and debris. Old bars had rusted over the smeared windows, the literal word “police” was painted above the door and had begun chipping off long ago. I pulled up to the curb, opening my door to get a blast of the wet cold, soon to turn into humidity, a hint of mildew and oil rot in the air as I walked up. The only patrol vehicle had cracked windows, with almost all the tires flat and empty… approaching the door a single sign read: “Until further notice all law enforcement responsibilities are to be directed to Louisiana State Police Troop-”. 

There was supposed to be someone here, at least that’s what I was given. I checked my info again and saw a code: “0432”. I scanned around and sure enough…. A small lock box I found hidden behind a bucket that I kicked away, causing it to roll down the sidewalk with a large echo. Inside? A set of keys and a laminated sheet with a set of addresses, and written on the bottom? ***“Good Luck”.*** 

Gee, thanks. I might be up shits creek, but at least I’ve been given a fork. 

The first few addresses were situated in the center of town, something I thought would give me comfort but I soon realized the extent of the “harvest” that had been conducted. Cars were either gone or abandoned, some parked half on the curb, others rotting in their driveways. Bushes and shrubs were overgrown, sidewalks had more weeds than, well, sidewalk. This place had become a borderline project left to decay, the swamps having reclaimed it as humanity had been driven out by… something. I parked along the road, stepping out and concealed my glock, though if I needed it a short, quick, violent run back to my Rav4 would provide me with heavier firepower.

They keys provided were to select addresses, although I’m sure had the cops still been around, they might as well have given me a masterkey to the neighborhood and let me start looking. Regardless I walked up to one of the single floor houses, placing the key in and… the lock wouldn’t give, too much rust. A single mule kick to the door, a few more months off my knees, and I was in. The smell of mildew hit me immediately, damn near suffocating… Dead air is lethal so I brought along a simple rebreather to keep my lungs clear. Windows had been broken open like on many houses exposing the insides to the elements yet there were signs that whomever had been here vanished. Sure things were kicked around by either animals or the wind and rain, but the table set up for dinner that had long since rotten and fuzed to the plates, toys still on the floor, a lounge chair kicked up with the remote on the seat… 

…. The imprints of people burned into the chairs, onto the table, in the lazy boy… 

I’ve got a stomach for many things, trudging through sewers with a pistol chassis and a light looking for beasts? That’s fine, burn pits took my sense of smell anyways. The sound of a shot impacting a target, the screams? The blood? I’m infantry, I’m desensitized to that, scraping person off a swamp drenched seat knowing they used to be man, woman, child? Not gonna lie, I wasn't too prepared for that… but I guess I’ve hit a new milestone. Placed it into a collection bag, left the house and locked it behind me. 

Sample analysis from it read: “Dried flesh and sulfur”. 

It was like this for several blocks, house after house the same thing… old homes turned into ruins, streets deserted, it felt more like a post apocalypse than a silent one but here I was rummaging through the aftermath like a scavenger. It was around the third house that I had left, no signs beyond silhouette imprints and rank smells, the shuffling of grass caused me to turn on a dime, hand sliding to my pistol grip… … to see a dog. 

It was a Belgian Malinois, I know cause I worked with them a lot as military working dogs both in training and overseas. German Shepards are terrifying but they’ve got nothing on the absolute mankiller than are these things. Gray and black fur, built like a truck… yet its coat was messy and unkempt, it seemed hesitant, wary of me as I looked at it. I had an idea… old bag of jerky I had seemed to bridge the gap and I took a few minutes picking barbs and twigs out of it’s fur. An old, worn red collar showed he’d been wandering these streets by himself for a while… the name read; “Zeus”, from the ‘Hartwell family”. My eyes turned to the house I had just exited, ‘Har\_we\_l” on inscribed with letters on the doorside mailbox. 

“Well…” I said, scratching behind the beast’s ears, by now his spirits had picked up; “You want to ride along with me for a bit?”. I was gonna place down a towel for the mal, as “Zeus” was still soaked in the outside swamp water, and probably had ticks… but… at this point I had been wandering through mildew infested houses, tracking stolen souls for hours and I had just about enough. We pulled up to another house, more towards the southern edge of the town… as we did, Zeus started to growl. In hindsight the capability a canine brings in terms of identifying threats I can’t is something I should have invested in earlier, keywords are ‘in hindsight’. I took a step out of the vehicle, not wanting to drag the poor dog into plaster and wood mausoleums, I approached the house which was just as unkempt as the others. Placing the lock into the door… it was pulled right open causing me to stagger…. The person on the other end was a woman, long blonde hair, hazel eyes, probably mid twenties. She raised an eyebrow and in a southern cajun drawl asked “Can I help you, sir?”. I was a bit flabbergasted, looking around to the dead neighborhood then back to her I sort of… didn’t have a response, because to be honest I had been sent under the pretense that the homes I was searching were empty. This one was not… “I Uh…” I stammered a bit, she seemed annoyed, then smiled “You’re from the government, aren’t you?”. I scratched the back of my head “Yeah, I… yes ma’am”. She invited me in, I did my best to dry my boots off as the house was far more maintained on the inside. 

I noted this “storms must have done a number to the town”. She chuckled and didn’t look back “That’s life here, mister. So tell me, what’re you looking for exactly?”. I took a look around, observing the inside of her house: “Reconnaissance so far… trying to gauge what’s going on, more than a gas leak but…”. “Gas Leak” is one of the official terms we used to play off events, preventing mass hysteria, it also draws out to see if someone knows more. She did, seemingly “Gas leak ain’t cause those screams, honey”. I raised an eyebrow, turning back to her “Screams”. She nodded, standing by the sink in the kitchen, washing her dishes “It got the neighbors a few nights ago, heard them and their little baby crying out, then the ones adjacent… some down the block, like fireflies slowly going out though you can hear every decibel…”. Her tone was chillingly gleeful describing this, I raised an eyebrow, my hand sliding under my jacket; “Did you reach out to anyone?”. She shrugged and I could see the flicker of a smile from behind her, standing a few meters away “Things don’t work like they do in Chicago, Dwight. Sometimes it’s best to look the other way and keep going, if you survive, it wasn’t your day…”. I then noticed the water she was using to wash the dishes was black, corrosive and dirty, borderline septic. 

The counter was also far more chipped and cracked than it had been, the walls were peeling, the carpet was mangled… then it hit me as my eyes locked on her and my hand gripped my pistol: “How do you know my name?”. She turned… hair greasy and hanging over her face as her expression was blank, her eyes were normal but something behind them, an intention that was malicious, evil. Her lips peeled back to reveal sharpened and worn down teeth as she screamed, pushing the limits of her vocal chords as she lunged, I drew my glock- -And I was back in the driver seat, my barrel clanged on the windshield as I found myself aiming with my hands over the steering wheel…. Where I had been exactly 7 minutes prior, door slightly ajar with my foot sticking out. Zeus had begun to bark like a maniac, first I thought it was me then I saw they were staring out the passenger window at the house. I looked… I couldn’t see anything through the smeared windows but I could tell it was still in there, this was a warning: “Get out or become a statistic”.

I wasn’t backing down but I needed more information…. I took 5 in the parking lot of an old restaurant, a burger joint I’d passed on the way in, possibly the only one left. Zeus was gnawing away at a burger I had gotten him, I couldn’t eat right now… nor was it ever good to have a full stomach. I’d learn later that’d be the right decision… My radio was hooked up to the wave relay mount on the back of my Rav4 boosting the signal so I could reach PEXU main. Montgomery and I spoke as I half sat out the door. \[“-You’re saying it can… manipulate reality?”\] the brit spoke. I rubbed my temples, keying in to the mic; “I’m saying one moment I was in the house about to be jumped, the next I had gotten rewound 10 minutes back”. A moment of silence passed as he responded: \[“Check your ATAK, I’ve updated you with contact information and a location for someone nearby who can help you, originally we were going to have you meet later but… we’re pushing the timeline forward, this is growing out of control”\]. It already was out of control. \[“Copy, November-1 out”\]. 

…

The “contact” was… okay so, you remember how I said Haitian voodoo and black magic was big in Louisiana, especially around New Orleans? It was just my luck, or more his experience, that made him one of the last people still in town, alongside the diner worker, the gas station rep, but certainly not the landscapers. His hideout was one of those under the convenience store stairwell type spots, a small window with an LED sign that read “Jaques, the Bone Lord”. 

I looked back to my ATAK reader, the address pointed to here, coordinates and all, the name was “Jaques De Lorne”. I swore if Montgomery just fed me to some organ harvester-. The door opened to see a man, late cities, peeking through wearing a leather coat and jeans. A set of blue lens glasses concealing tired eyes… he looked to me, then to Zeus, then back to me: “No animals”. 

I shook my head “I’m not leaving ‘em in the car, we already paid you”. The tense stare was interrupted by the closing of the door, and the sounds of several dozen locks being undone as he opened it up fully; “Dog stays on the corner mat, you go to the table” Jaques muttered. Where do I even begin with this place… well he wasn’t called the “bone lord” for nothing; skeleton parts seemed to line or dog every piece of furniture, furnishing, and even make up a few shelves as the smell of incense in the dimly lit shop surrounded us. I leaned forward on the old round table, taking note of all of the calcium artifacts: “These aren’t real skeletons around us, right?” I asked. 

Jaques sat back in his chair “Does it matter?”. “Guess not” I said, sliding the sample from before with a print out of the details. 

“You journeyed into those homes?” He asked, realizing the situation with a surprised raise of the eyebrow. “Yeah?” I asked, though I should have been wiser to what he was meaning. Jaques flipped up his glass lenses and looked to me; “I never ventured that far, everytime I tried to cross to see what had made this place taboo, it felt like a hand was clenching my throat” he said gesturing towards his neck as he continued “-suffocating… I have been trapped here since. This place is no stranger to rifts, but… something must’ve crawled out of one”. “Something?” I asked, a confused raise of the eyebrow. Jaques shook his head “I have been looking into this since I could barely walk, and even then… I will still never even know a percent of the other side. Imagine a microbe attempting to learn about humanity… that is the depth of which we face now, Nolan Dwight”. “So…” I said leaning back “What? We’ve got no idea of what this is or how to stop it?”. Jaques waved off the defeatist take and pulled out a map; “If I were to guess…. An Umbra”. “A what?”. 

“A leech… someone attempted to contact the other side, it latched on and pulled them in, used them as a line to cross through… now it is free from it’s fast, it is growing fat on all those who surround it” Jaques then laid out the map of the area… and drew a circle showing the extent… having now crossed far out of the borders. “Did you experience any more of these warps? The not real parts in time?” He asked. “Once crossing in from Oklahoma…” I said, remembering the rest stop. He stopped, a long swallow; “We need to seal it away… I know where”. I raised an eyebrow, he pointed to an old complex just to the northeast of the town; “Old warehouse, previously used for lumber to carve into the swamps… you know the trail of tears?” he asked, I was confused but I nodded.

“One of the old routes ran through here… many sick or wounded left to die, others, later slaves, buried in the same cemetery, a whole lot of death… only wooden markers denoting their resting spots. Now? Paved over and forgotten, even that laid abandoned” Jaques’ retelling had his words grow more and more pained as he finished. “So… what? All of the deaths...-” I said putting the pieces together, he laid it all out “Must’ve attracted something… I hear them every night, Nolan Dwight. Old generation and new, begging to be set free, I thought I was going crazy, they were ghosts… but you saw the aftermath… we need to end this, please”. He was trapped here, unable to leave as the threshold had surrounded his entire house. I wasn’t as tied to the otherside of him, no leashes to drag me down, and it already showed it was afraid. If this Umbra was feasting off of all these people like they were batteries, I was going to have to go in there and undo it all. 

The route took me to a drop off the side of an interstate heading north from the town, I popped open the trunk and retrieved the essentials… pulling my plate carrier over my jacket, pulling on my belt and clipping the leg strap of my holster, the final touches was checking the light on my rifle and slamming the trunk shut. I stopped when I looked to the passenger seat, Zeus was barking, scratching at the door… practicality said to leave him where it’s safe, however part of me didn’t want to leave him here… and another wagered that, in some respect, he knew what was down that muddy and gravel filled drop into the woods, and wanted some payback of his own. 

I opened the door and the Mal took off, forcing me to hoof it down to catch up; “Zeus!! Zeus for fucksakes!!” I called out, causing him to stop at the bottom as he stood firm, ears up and looking around. I stopped behind him as he hugged one of my legs, my rifle pointed into the brush. From the trees… they were looking at us, the disheveled, haunting forms of people just behind the bark bodies of the forest staring at us. They looked almost normal, but not quite.. Some parts of them were blurred, other parts I swore were intact were decayed, they were both dead and alive, stuck perpetually in whatever this weaponized hell for them was. My optic’s red reticle traced over them all, surrounding us as I took stock… they were sizing us up, we weren’t relenting… the air grew stale and the only sound to greet us was the sound of rain dropping off the trees. Then… one of them took off… 

My rifle took aim as I shouted; “Stop!! Stop!!”, though it was more of me doing my part as I fired, the round tore through them and the thrall melted into the same decayed slop as before. Then all of them began to converge; sets of two to three shots as I switched from target to target, Zeus jumped onto one, a larger man, sinking their teeth into the neck and tearing them apart before they too melted into the same state. My rifle went dry forcing me to draw my pistol, a couple of them reached out, silent screams as their jaws were wide.

One slick motion, my barrel was level and a set of rounds cracked off and the nearby area was cleared empty. We had to move… Zeus and I took off down the trail, still being chased as I took aim, firing shots standing, braced against the tree, giving us some breathing room before we reached a clearing. I staggered out, Zeus sniffing the air as he growled… I messily reloaded a new magazine, the old one hitting the forest floor as I slapped the bolt release home, aimed my rifle….

The forest was quiet, the only sign of anything besides my firing on the trail was a hissing line of decay marks burning into the forest floor.

“Fucksakes…” I muttered, topping off my glock as I looked down to the Malinois before I quipped “I need to get a new career” to Zeus.

The dog simply looked up, none the wiser to what I was saying; “Yeah… you’re right, I should just shut up”.

I turned back to our target; a gigantic skeleton of rusted metal supports and sheet wall, standing just above the trees in the dense forest with cracked concrete and stones surrounding it. The warehouse… My rifle was raised as I approached, Zeus having taken up some sort of roving circle around me as I made for one of the closer entrances. Moss and leaves hung above through the cracks as water kept pouring down… A gigantic cracked concrete foundation floor with an empty shell of a building surrounding it. The old structure groaned and cried out as I looked up and around, seemingly nothing to greet us… Zeus however was too busy sniffing the floor, digging at the concrete as I turned asking “What? Smell something?”.

Jaques did say it was built over a mass grave, only question was… how to get through several feet of old concrete. I lowered my rifle and measured my options, opening the phone mount on my carrier to switch open ATAK and see what assets I had available… though I didn’t like the idea of sitting there for several hours waiting for a cutter or- 

“What you’re looking for, isn’t here Dwight” I was drawn out of my planning by a voice from behind, one that I knew very well though, it didn’t click when I heard it as instincts took over and I turned and aimed my rifle but… what I saw. An… old soldier, and a friend, wearing dirty outdated UCP digital fatigues… he stepped out from behind an old factory machine, still the same… like the last time I saw him… a decade and a half prior…. High and tight brown haircut, square jaw, shorter, stockier guy, his name tape read “Clancy”. “What…. The fuck?” I asked, my barrel lowering out of shock, there he was in tan boots, a slight smile on his face just like I remembered. As he took a step forward, my sense came back to me, as did Zeus’ rabid growling and barking, Clancy’s face contorted to that of hatred and rage, that was enough to sober me up as I took aim at him. “Clancy” didn’t like that “Dwight? What the hell are you doing?!”.

 I shook my head “You didn’t make it out of Kandahar… I don’t know what this is but I’m not going to let you disgrace my fucking friend like this”. It took another step forward, my thumb flipped my rifle to semi, the single sound caused it to pause “I gave you a chance, Nolan”. 

I shook my head “Don’t do this… let him walk away and come fucking face me yourself”. 

A moment of silence passed, I took a single shaky breath… and fired. The firing pin hit the primer as the barrel sun and a round shot out… and he was gone, I was looking dead at him and yet he was just… gone. There wasn’t a pile of decayed mess underneath, his body wasn’t here… another fucking illusion. Zeus ran forward, barking loud as I heard a single crack… then another. 

Then… the concrete gave out, crumbled, my stomach jumped straight up and grabbed onto my throat damn near, as I went into total free fall. The light above grew more and more dim before I hit the ground- hard. A combination of rocks and dirty made me glad I wore side plates as I did what I could to brace myself, Zeus’ barking from above pulling me slowly out of my shock as I staggered to my knee. I grabbed my rifle and turned on the light… I soon realized the sound I was hearing wasn’t water falling, but… melting. They were all there… hundreds fused and melted together in some hideous form of old decaying flesh, a thousand eyes and a hundred mouths all crying out as a grotesque form of several limbs all around a central mass stood in the darkness. There it was… the Umbra. “...FUCK!!!” was the last thing I remember saying before staggering back fast enough to avoid it as it lunged forward, one of its limbs had a dozen skeletal rotten hands grabbing out, clutching and scratching at the dirt as the sound of flesh falling off as their bones made contact with the stone filled my ears. 

I flicked my rifle onto auto, firing off a burst into it. Flesh and meat tore from its central body as all of them screamed loud enough to pierce my eardrums. Thank god for my comtac headset… then, it moved, faster than it ever should have as I leaped to get out of the way, however one of the side limbs used its thousand hands to grab onto the back of my plate carrier dragging me to it. The sensation of a dozen indentured, trapped lives being used to try and tear me apart made my spine crawl right out of my body. I fought to move forward, then got dragged into my ass as they all started to tear at my jacket and kit.

Still I fired into it, tearing off parts of the arm and body as I stomped fingers and palms causing them to melt off as pools of rotten flesh.

From above I heard Zeus’ roars getting louder… remember when I said Malinois’ were crazy? I wasn’t kidding… Those canines will leap through reinforced glass or smash through a fence to get their target. I guess Zeus had de facto adopted me as his partner or designated it the enemy, because he leaped onto the top and began to tear at its body.

Oh boy did he tear… skin flew as it writhed, I muzzle thumped my barrel into its body and fired… it retreated back so fast Zeus fell off and onto the floor, although it did little to stop the dog as he’s proven he’s built durable. It attempted to flee…. I looked around at the mud and old concrete piled around us in this strange lair… it retreated further. 

Zeus barked, not backing down. 

“Get back here!!” I shouted, I took off after it, I flicked my rifle’s magazine out and slapped a new one in. Zeus was not far behind as I aimed my light and took shots at the form as it fell apart. The voices started to get dimmer, I didn’t know if that meant it was getting further, or if we were cutting off more parts of it… suddenly we were bathed by darkness and… I fell through a door. A literal door, onto a carpet, I was back in one of the houses. I shot to my feet, seeing the layout of one of the homes I had cleared earlier, I looked around… surrounding me as they sat on the couches, the chairs, at the table were those taken. I remember this house exactly as they were right where I analyzed their places, it was keeping them here… trapped. It wasn’t going to trap me, I sprinted forward towards the back door, Zeus nowhere to be seen as they took off after me, I kicked open the back door and jumped through.

This time I was in where I wager the police station was, the small gray square building had maybe two cells on the inside in stereotypical barred cage set ups. Two officers in the dark blue uniforms of local Louisiana cops sat up from their desks, I fired at one (only doing so because I knew this wasn’t real, full disclosure, I don’t just shoot cops). As they dropped, melting through the desk and corroding it to cause it to collapse, the other leaped at me, gnashing their broken teeth. They grabbed my pistol, leaving me with one option… I reached for the center of my plate carrier, drawing my bench made knife and stabbing them through the bottom of their mouth into their brain stem. Kicking them off I ran for the door to the outside and put my shoulder into it… then realized it opened inwards, and swung it open as I sheathed my blade. 

What hit me was something I didn’t expect… A blast of cool air nearly blinded me as I slid and fell, my ass hitting the dirt slopes of a mountain, deep in the southeastern region of Afghanistan. I aimed my rifle as I could hear it, the sound being so vivid I felt like I was 24 again… the distant pops, the rumbling, the high altitude smell… I was on an old road I remembered… I took off forward, knowing the exact trail. I kept my footing careful as I didn’t want to lose my step or I would be taking a 3,000 ft trip down the fast ward, instead I rounded the corner to a cave entrance. Over a decade ago it was an old listen and operation post for the Mujh we had the job of taking out, my first mission as a newly promoted squad leader. I remember staring into that black abyss just as I did now… I marched forward and for the final time found myself falling through darkness… 

…. Then a set of teeth grabbing at my jacket sleeve as Zeus pulled me forward, dragging me from a drop off into the cave, onto an old set of stone tiles. I quickly tossed my rifle up as I grabbed the edge, pulling myself up. I took a moment to get my bearings, scratching behind his ear “Thanks bud…”. I used the stock of my rifle to push me back up to my feet as I scanned around with my light… an old mausoleum… the sound of tearing and wet splashes could be heard ahead as we both pushed forward.

In the central room, with light shining from the morning sun coming through the bars, laid the torn body mass the umbra inhabited. The remaining eyes in the fleshy mass looked to us, screaming out as I took aim and fired. The full auto burst punched straight through the center as it attempted to reach for us, Zeus grabbed on and bit, then I  stomped down and fired at its arm tearing it off. As my Malinois took great pleasure shaking the writhing limb to death, I reached into a dangler pouch on my plate carrier and dumped a bag of salt onto the thing… it crackled and hissed, as I lit a match… and set it alight. 

Jaques said he had a theory it was an Umbra, no way of telling for sure. When in doubt? Salt and burn it out. I forced open the iron gate through generations worth of dirt and grass clumped up, Zeus took off as I dropped my mag, loading a fresh one and firing into it. I slammed the gate shut as it grabbed at the bars and reached through, screaming more and more as it slowly melted into nothing but char. The last set of eyes met mine as I watched it “die”, no more souls would be trapped, no more people would be harvested, no more memories were getting replayed like some sick fuckin’ remix. 

“Fuckin’ shit…” I said, a glorious exhale as I walked away, replacing the burnt flesh rotting stench in my lungs with crisp forest air. Zeus followed, I set my rifle down on a tree, leaning back as the adrenaline started to wear off and I could feel the freezing amount of sweat I had after the ordeal.

It wasn’t perfect, the area still smelt and felt like death… but the suffocating fog of dread had worn off.

After a quick look around… \[“November-1 to main… OPFOR-Actual is ***Echo-Xray***”\]. 

…

Sometimes you’ve gotta persevere, though let’s just say I’m in no mood to go back to Louisiana anytime soon. Regardless it was probably the most vivid as whatever it was, Umbra or not, made those “blasts to the past” straight out of the cerebral theater. It’s not something I was looking to run it back at and I told Montgomery as such… but he put it best: “We don’t have the luxury of choice right now when we’re knee deep in problems and burdened by shorthandness”.

Though, hey… a few weeks after Zeus acclimatized very well. What? You thought I was gonna leave him there? Absolutely not… No, that dog is the reason I’m still around, for better or for worse, so the least I could do was get him out of there. Turns out yes, he did have fleas… a lot of them, fumigation of my car and the clean up was extremely nice as you could imagine. However he enjoys the open area of my property, even more so in the following weeks I’d end up taking him on several more missions.

Whatever his senses are, he’s able to point out a threat immediately, he’s as much of an asset to the small unit I’ve got going as he is a friend. Though… Well, some mornings I’ll walk outside to grab my paper and bring him with me. Zeus will stare out into the fields with his ears pointed up like he’s seeing something… then, he’ll growl. The first time he did this, I noticed the area was silent… just like it had been before. No day gets any easier, out of the frying pan… you know the rest. I’ve gotta go, got another target package rolling in now, one that I should be able to update you on as we’ve caught up on some of the big stuff… for now, this is Dwight Nolan.

Not in the creepy, staring-through-your-windows kind of way, but something subtler. Like he was pretending to be somebody he wasn’t. His stories about work shifted constantly, as if he couldn’t keep track of the life he was inventing. No friends, no family ever came to visit. There was always something that didn't quite add up.

But I never expected things to get as twisted as they did.

We lived across from each other in a four-unit flat. I was in 2W, and he was in 2E.

The first time I met him was the night I moved in. It was pouring rain, and I was soaked, struggling to carry the last few boxes inside when Alex suddenly appeared. He was just there, standing in the rain without an umbrella, offering to help with a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. Later, I left a six-pack of Budweiser at his door as a thank you.

It sat there for days, untouched.

From then on, we’d occasionally exchange pleasantries in the hallway, small talk about the weather and sometimes weekend plans. But something about Alex always put me on edge. Maybe it was the way his eyes lingered on me, or how he always seemed to know things about me… things I never remembered telling him.

There was one time in particular that stuck with me.

I was late for a concert, rushing out the door when Alex stepped into the hallway. We exchanged quick hellos and how are yous, but as I flew down the stairs, he called after me.

“Enjoy Odesza!”

I was in the Uber for 10 minutes before I realized something. I never told Alex where I was going. I hadn’t mentioned the concert that night or Odesza ever. Especially that they were my favorite band. How did he know? Little things like that started to pile up. It felt like Alex knew more about me than any neighbor should.

\*\*\*\*

One day, I came home to find a package at my door.

There was no return address, just my name and address written neatly on the label. I wasn’t expecting anything, but I figured maybe it was something from Amazon I had ordered and forgotten about. But inside was a small, black notebook, worn and frayed. At the top of the first page, my name and address were written in careful handwriting. 

Then a pink post-it note fell off and fluttered to the ground. 

It had a hastily handwritten note:

***Found this at McGurk’s. No reward necessary. Pay it forward :)***

I’d been to McGurk’s recently. Just a casual bar I go to with friends every once in a while. 

But I had never seen this notebook before. It certainly wasn't mine.

Flipping through the pages, my stomach turned. Detailed notes filled every line. What time I left for work, what I wore each day, where I went, who I spoke to. Everything was there, meticulously documented. 

Dates and times with events... repeating and repeating.

Walking to the grocery store, grabbing coffee at Picasso's down the street. Every page felt like a violation, a snapshot of my life through someone else’s eyes. But it wasn’t just the invasion of privacy that made me sick to my stomach. It was the realization that whoever had been watching me almost knew me better than I knew myself.

And then it hit me: Alex.

There was no other explanation. He had been watching me, keeping tabs on my every move. The strange comments, the way he always seemed to know what I was doing, it all made sense now. But why leave the notebook at my door? Was it some kind of sick joke, a way to let me know he was always there, always watching?

I couldn’t sit with the dread any longer. I had to confront him. It was late, but I didn’t care. My anger boiled over, fueled by fear.

I stormed across the hall and knocked on 2E's door, the notebook clenched in my hand. After a moment, the door opened, and there he stood, as calm as ever, with that same eerie smile plastered across his face. But the moment his eyes fell on the notebook in my hand, something shifted. The smile didn’t fade, but I saw a flicker in his expression. A glimpse of something darker.

""I think you dropped something,"" I said harshly, holding up my evidence.

Alex’s eyes narrowed.

For a second, I expected him to deny everything, to play dumb. But instead, he did something I hadn’t anticipated. He smiled wider, a grin that sent a chill down my spine.

""You shouldn't have opened that,"" he said softly. ""You really shouldn't have.""

Before I could respond, he stepped back and slammed the door in my face. I stood there, stunned. What the hell had just happened? Should I call the police? But what would I even tell them? That my neighbor had a creepy notebook filled with notes about me? That I thought he had been stalking me?

That night, I hardly slept. Every creak in the building, every soft sound, made me feel like my insides were jumping. I kept replaying Alex’s words in my head, trying to make sense of it all. But nothing could have prepared me for what I found the next morning.

When I walked to my door to leave for work, I gasped.

My door, which I had locked the night before, as I always triple checked, was slightly ajar. Just enough to make my skin crawl. Slowly, I scanned my apartment, searching for a sign that someone had been inside.

And laid out neatly on my coffee table, were dozens of photographs. All of me.

Me at work. Me walking to the store. Me inside my apartment. Me doing everything that had been cataloged in that damn notebook.

Every single one was taken from a distance, someone watching me. Some of the photos were recent, but others dated back months.

He had been watching me from the moment I moved in.

My hands trembled as I dialed 911, but before I could hit the call button, I heard a sound behind me. I spun around, my heart in my throat.

There was Alex, standing in the doorway, smiling that same cold, dark smile.

""I told you,"" he said softly. ""You shouldn’t have opened that notebook.""

Then I blinked and he was gone.

\*\*\*\*

I tried to resume my life the next day, but a world of trouble waited for me.

My bank accounts were frozen. Credit cards were being declined. My emails were locked. It felt like my life was being erased. I tried to get help, but no one knew who Alex was.

My landlord said 2E had been vacant for a year, waiting on renovations to finish.

My downstairs neighbors had never heard of Alex.

Day by day, I lost pieces of myself. My habits changed. What I wore, how I talked, even my thoughts. It was subtle at first, then more pronounced. I stopped sleeping because every time I closed my eyes, I saw Alex standing there, smiling.

I even avoided mirrors. Because every time I caught my reflection, it wasn’t quite right. I looked different, like I didn't recognize myself. One night, I smashed every mirror in my apartment, shards of glass covering the floor.

Yet I still felt empty and confused.

Desperate for answers, I walked back to 2E and pushed the unlocked door open.

The apartment was empty, cobwebs in a corner, a new floor half-installed. The whole place was covered in dust. Then I saw it on the ground. The black notebook. My hands shook as I picked it up.

Inside were details about Alex. His name, his address handwritten. It sort of looked like my handwriting. And the person the notes were describing didn't sound like Alex. They sounded like they were describing me. How I looked. My routines and habits.

Panic set in, and I turned to leave 2E.

But Alex was there in the doorway, that same dark smile on his face.

“Your life is mine,” he whispered.

His voice echoed in my head. I ran past him, out of the building and into the night.

I just remember running.

I ended up somewhere in town I had never been.

And I couldn't quite remember how to get home.

Weeks blurred together after that. I wandered, forgetting where I was, who I was. My name, my apartment. All of it faded away, until there was nothing left but darkness.

The next memory I have is of a rainy night. It was pouring. And that I could see someone, a girl finishing moving into an apartment building. A six unit flat. 

She was working on the last few boxes. Suddenly I was next to her, startling her.

“Hello, stranger!” she said to me with a laugh. “You really snuck up on me!”

“Oh, sorry for that. I’m a little out of sorts,” I said instinctively, like I was on autopilot. “Could you use some help?”

“That’d be wonderful,” she said, stacking my outstretched arms with two boxes. “I’m Josie, by the way. Moving into 3W right here. Do you live in the building…”

She was waiting for my name. I tried to say it, to remember it, but only one name would leave my lips.

“Alex,” I said, unwillingly, with a smile. “I’m in 3E, right across from you.”",2,1728873135.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

He doesn’t play with his toys anymore, he just tests and tests and tests me, constantly touching things he knows he’s not aloud to, he has started crying so hard to the point of hyperventilating when getting his diaper changed, he used to just lay there and happily let me do it, now it’s WWE when changing him.

Believed to have had a pretty unhealthy tendon to begin with that was worsened when my muscle became completely stuck down to it during recovery from my first surgery. Still waiting to find out the exact details but all in all, very unfortunate.
Now 5 days post op from my second surgery which was a turn down procedure with the gastrocnemius and plantaris tendon. Feeling good and staying positive, first time round I let this injury completely de rail my mental health. The recovery was extremely challenging and something I would tell loved ones I could never go through again… well here I am. Besides the day I found out I’d need to start over, I have actually felt really good. Come to terms with the fact that this is life, I’m an athlete and I’ve been blessed with what my body has and continues to enable me to do. Shit happens and yeah it sucks but dwelling on it isn’t helpful for me right now. I really just have to put my head down and focus on moving forward. I am also very blessed and privileged with not only support from loved ones but access to excellent healthcare which I will acknowledge, allows me to maintain this mindset.

After the second rupture it was a bit of a wake up call, I’ve been pretty blessed with injuries but this one is different. Where I’d typically just rely on my body to get the job done, it’s not going to hurt to really give myself the best chance at healing strong so here are some things I’ve done differently/are worth the money:

- Knee scooter: I always wanted one but didn’t want to pay and don’t hate crutches that much so just dealt with it. However know that I have one, it is a game changer. I’ve only used it at home so far but being able to make myself food, carry a plate and coffee to the dining table and even fill up my own drink bottle - major, seriously good for my mental health.

- Elevation pillow: Didn’t want to spend the money on it first time round when I could just use regular pillows. They definitely sufficed but I struggled a lot with knee pain as I have hyperextended legs and having no support there meant they were constantly locked straight. I bought one from Amazon for like $40 and it’s been amazing, so glad I did that this time around.

- Supplements: I have been religious with my supplements and vitamins. Every day I take hydrolysed collagen peptides, magnesium, vitamin D, vitamin C and Iron. I typically have pretty poor levels here so making sure I am on top of it has been super important to me.

- Diet: I was vegetarian for 11 years and stayed vego during my first rupture. Whilst I fully support being able to get protein from plant sources, for me I really struggle. I’m not great at planning meals and would tend to just scrape by on bare minimum due to lack of organisation. After a lot of consideration and chats with my physio and a dietitian, we decided to introduce meat into my diet, just to ensure I’m getting plenty of protein to add the recovery of this tendon. It’s been challenging and different but I know it’s for the best as my protein intake has jumped seamlessly from around 40-60 grams per day to at least 120-130 grams.  

- Physio: I am still in my cast but this time round I’ll be heading to the physio at 3 weeks post op to get movement happening early on as well as working on my back and hips as 6 months in a boot/on crutches has certainly taken a toll. Given everything was super stuck last time, this is going to be really important and I am very lucky that my physio is experienced with ruptures so whilst we won’t be doing anything to the tendon directly, getting things moving early on is super important for my recovery. 

Hopefully this post is helpful whether it’s your first rupture or you’ve found yourself experiencing a re rupture. I feel like there is a lot of anxiety around the thought of re rupturing and whilst it is devastating, I hope this shows you that it’s not the end of the world.

Would love to hear others recommendations on things they are doing to aid their recovery as well!! Always keen to add more to the list to give myself the best shot at getting this shit done haha ",3,1728872699.0,AchillesRupture,1,1.0,False

I've referred to a couple of sources and adjusted according to my preference. 

All spirits are 80 proof
- 1.75 cup vodka (14 oz)
- 0.25 cup Rum (2 oz)
- 0.5 cup Brandy (4 oz)

Peel 2 Navel oranges without any pith (60 to 70g)
 
1 tbsp Dried curacao oranges peel (8g - 10g)

Infuse all above ingredients in a mason jar for 20 days. 

On Day 14, chop 1 pitted prune and add to the infusion.

On day 20, add 4 whole cloves and 1 small piece of cinnamon and let it infuse for 1 more day. 

On day 21, Strain and pass through coffee filter to remove fine sediments.

Add 75ml Rich Simple syrup (66g sugar + 34g Water)

Add 0.5ml Vanilla extract (15 drops).

Shake to combine and bottle.

You can use it immediately but online articles say its best to consume after another 2 weeks. I'm going to use it immediately as it's turned out quite well.

This end result is 70 proof orange liquer and contains only 3g sugar per fl.oz.

Sugar content in same volume of Pierre Ferrand dry Curacao is 5.4g and Cointreau is 6.8g.

1g35ttc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1g35ttc/is_she_flirtinginterested/,Is she flirting/interested?,"Hello Ladies,

I am a 31(M) in need of some insight. As I am a man I can be somewhat thick headed when it comes to whether a woman is flirting with me or not. I will provide some context:

My coworker and I (Who travels to support us and lives in another state) flew down to help support our rocket build. She is an avionics design engineer and made a lot of the drawings/designs that I as a technician use to install the harnesses. She has been down once before, and the first time we worked together, it was very positive. She was very involved, much more so than even the other engineers thar come down.

She got into the installation itself with me as well. I learned early on that she is from Russia, and of course I was kind and cordial. I did of course notice that she takes good care of herself. She is fit and yes, I think attractive. 

So here’s where it started to get kind of interesting? Along the course of us working on the installs of the harnesses. There were several moments where she would accidentally? Brush my arms and hands and they would linger for a bit as well. Since this was the first time I ever worked with her, I didn’t think much of it, I didn’t want to assume that she was flirting or anything. I wanted to be respectful of course. I did thank her for being so helpful, and let her know that I enjoyed working with her. I also asked her a few questions about Russian Culture, as I was genuinely interested. This was the first time I met her.

The second time most recently, she came down again to help with avionics installs. When I met her again after she returned, I greeted her warmly and with a smile using her first name. During these next few days, she seemed quite keen on getting involved and told me if she wanted me to have her come and help with the installs to let her know.

Since she seemed so adamant the last time, I wanted to let her do so as she seemed to enjoy helping. This time, we were pretty much alone several times, high up on a lift working on putting the harness on where no one could see us. During this time I did not initiate any physical touch“. I asked her questions about what she wanted and how to install the harness correctly. When going to do the installs, she would often point to areas and would brush up quite a bit against my arms and hands while helping. She was also extremely close in my own personal space at several points when she didn’t need to be. There were other moments where she brushed up against my side and in general. When we were around others she seemed to act a bit different, more professional and matter of fact. She even stayed late with me to help get the build done, and walked with me to the car. I felt like we had a special moment as we were walking. She noticed a double rainbow on the way to our cars and remarked how beautiful it was. It was honestly breathtaking, and I agreed with her. When we got to part ways, it seemed like she was perhaps expecting something, as she kind of awkwardly said, “Well, I’ll see you tomorrow then.” I thought maybe she was expecting me to ask for her number at that point, but of course I wasn’t sure. Besides this, when we were up on the lift, I did touch/brush up against her hands as well just to test her reaction, and she didn’t back away from it at all, seemed to like the reciprocated flirting?

I also joked with her a bit the days we worked together, to which she laughed and smiled. There were also glances back and forth and some smiles from both of us throughout the day. I am pretty sure that at this point she is genuinely interested. She seemed very comfortable to enter my space and I felt like all of the “accidental” touching was her way of conveying her attraction. 

I am stuck on whether or not she was being flirty or friendly. Part of me definitely wants to believe she was, because I definitely am into her. But the other part believes maybe she was just being friendly and is comfortable around me. I also don’t want to be the guy that comes off as weird or accused of something like sexual harassment if in fact she is not interested and I am misinterpreting her signals.

The latest is that I have gotten her #, and we’ve texted a bit back and forth. She did tease me once about going on one of her “beach walks” at one point. I did let her know that I would like to do that with her the next time she comes down, as she told me at one point she enjoys going on walks. Early on texting her, I did ask her if she’d like to get coffee sometime. She never responded to that text directly so it left me somewhat confused.

So what are y’all gals thoughts? I am maybe 80% sure she is interested. But the fact she has been a bit aloof on whether she would like to go on a date has left me a bit puzzled. Please share your thoughts, or advice on how I should proceed? I thought it would be a good idea to get a lady’s perspective! :)",0,1728872112.0,AskWomenOver30,0,0.33,False

She's always been very ""I can do it myself"" which I respect but a lot of the time it comes off a jealousy or she will say she can do it and then lie in bed for hours procrastinating and get mad when I offer to do it for her.

E.G Today I was awake before her and got up, made a coffee pottered around the house as per usual and also did some odd jobs (dishwasher, cutting the dogs grass on her pee mat etc).

When she woke up I came back and gave her a hug lay next to her and when she asked what I did and I told her, she completely shut down said ""I could've done that"" and got really upset. I told her that ofc she could've I have complete faith in her, but it was just a shared chore it will all balance out in the end. And then she shut down and told me she was going back to sleep (and not to take shots but it's midday by this point that is complete B.S imo).

It's been going on for months, it'll get bad, we'll argue and then drop it and repeat. I have brought it up that I don't appreciate being made to feel guilty for trying to be arguably helpful.and just trying to give us a great life and she agrees and says she just feels like she isn't able to contribute and no matter what I say she.wont believe that I just want us to be happy and I don't mind doing the chores. 


TL:DR : my gf is mad and upset that she thinks I'm doing more chores and she can ""do it herself"" and makes me feel guilty for that. We have discussed multiple times but nothings changed and I don't know what to do.

1g35rba,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1g35rba/had_a_tooth_pulled_when_i_was_a_kid_and_never_got/,Had a tooth pulled when I was a kid and never got it replaced. Will this cause issues now that I am older?,"https://imgur.com/a/IJ2OHsk

When I was 15, I had a very traumatic experience with the dentist. I ended up having to have a root canal on a tooth, which in itself was pretty bad. But the dentist was not a very good dentist, and it resulted in the root canal being done half assed, and the tooth needed to be pulled. I never went back to the dentist after that as I was actually traumatized.  

I ended up going to the dentist 15 years later, shortly after turning 30. And unsurprisingly (because of my trauma I obsess over my teeth and take very good care of them), besides some usual staining from food and drink, my new dentist said my teeth were pretty much perfect. He did however find a very small cavity at the very last minute, which was most likely a result of my daughter being born shortly before and me consuming copious amounts of coffee and sugary drinks to stay awake. 

As you can see, I have circled two teeth. Don’t pay any mind to the black areas, as I think it is some kind of filling that the dentist used when I was a kid. Not sure why he did that, as I did not have any cavities on those teeth. But as I’m sure you can tell, I have a small space in between those two teeth. That is where the tooth was removed when I was a kid. 

My question is though, I’ve noticed that the gum area where the tooth is missing is slightly sinking in. How serious is this? As you can see, my back wisdom tooth has come in, and it slightly shifted my teeth so that you can barely notice that I was missing that tooth anyway. And I don’t have any kind of pain or notice any other abnormalities. But will this cause issues in the future?",1,1728871876.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

At first the conversations was hit and miss. Then about a week and a half ago it really kicked off. We have soo much in common. We love cars we both ride motorcycles which is a huge plus because I’m neck deep in motorcycles it’s an addiction. 

Everything was super respectful, didn’t really talk about sex except for a few innuendos. Which for me it was a huge relief and pleasure because I’m pan and sometimes match with men which ugh doesn’t get far because all they want is sex. 

A lot of the time we were talking it was like I was talking to myself Like omg girl same noo way. To the point I felt like I had to hold back saying that so I didn’t sound toxic ( idk how to describe why) we would stay up all night texting eachother way past bedtimes. 
I felt giddy every time my phone dinged that she texted me. 
We eventually decided to have a date at a cafe then plan to watch a movie at her place. 

I feel like here’s where it went down hill. 

The day before the date I confessed my dating profile name was a fake name, it was actually an old name I used before settling on my now permanent prefered name. 

I explained I did it for safety. I’ve had a rough history in the past, so for safety I have a few personal rules I don’t give my number out and I don’t give out my actual name until I meet in person and it goes well. I’ve had a few sour dates that I was thankful I kept to that rule. 

She was taken back but understood. She explained that she was taken back because she felt I didn’t trust her and it gave old triggers from her ex. 
She prior had said had a rough break up with her ex and was without saying it directly was still dealing with the blow from that rough relationship. 

After I confessed the conversations died down abit. 
But she was still super excited for the date. 

Yesterday was the date. I drove out and met her. We went to a town Halloween event, it was crowded and unfortunately aimed towards young family’s with toddlers which we didn’t know that detail. 

Before I walked up to her I could see she was dissociated. Something I use todo all the time prior to feeling comfortable with myself out in public. 

We ordered coffee and sat down. 
Having a conversation with her was like pulling teeth she kept her cup of coffee to her mouth so she didn’t have to speak staring out the window in what I would I assume nervous dissociating. I couldn’t help but smile she was sooooooo beautiful 😻 omg thinking about seeing her in my head how she looked I can’t help but smile. 
Her profile pictures did no justice.

We finished our coffees and went to walk around the vendors event. She barely spoke as much as tried to interact with her. Just looking distant. 

We reached the end of the vendors event which wasn’t long and she stopped and looked down at me and apologized. Saying I’m sorry I can’t do this can’t do this I’m sorry you drove out this way. 
We hugged good bye and I said no worries maybe another time. 
Btw she’s taller than me which is rare cuz I’m 5’10 in flats IM THE SHORT QUEEN, It felt amazing. I went home and again said maybe next time we can try again where’s it not crowded. She apologized saying it wasn’t my fault she was just in a bad spot emotionally and shouldn’t have planned anything that week because of it but also doesn’t wanna meet up with anyone again for a while.

Since then the conversations have been short and not much. Trying to talk to her feels forced, I try to suggest maybe we could bake something. Also saying how today’s weather would’ve been perfect cuddle weather which prior to the date she would’ve loved to hear and say yess it be great to prove how good of a cuddler she is. Now it’s nothin. 


I feel like I fucked up some how. Idk where but it does. I really like this girl I haven’t felt this connection ever before. I don’t wanna stop talking to her or give up. But the conversations have practically died. I just wanna give her a warm hug and apologize for whatever I did if I did anything. 

Any advice on what I should do ? 
Sorry if there’s a speach impediment in my long rabble and how long this was.

I loosely followed a DIY kotatsu tutorial (https://www.myperpetualproject.com/lets-build-a-coffee-table-kotatsu-style/) and there’s lots of other tutorials if you Google DIY kotatsu.

If you don’t want to make one, you can buy one from Amazon or Ebay!

Table base + top 

   • I got the table base and table top on Facebook marketplace. 

   • The teakwood base was complete – all I had to do was oil the wood and add slats to hold the heater element + on the sides so the blanket wouldn’t cave in. 

   • The table top was originally a solid door blank, so I had to cut it down to size and stain/finish it.


Blankets + heating 

   • The patterned sitting quilt + pillow covers are from Facebook marketplace. 

   • The green table comforter is from Amazon. 

   • The kotatsu heating element was imported from Japan on Ebay. 

   • Voltage converter to use the Japanese kotatsu heating element in the US was from Amazon! THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR FIRE SAFETY. USE THE CORRECT VOLTAGE SO YOU DON’T CAUSE AN ELECTRIC FIRE",1,1728871133.0,u_pantspantsplants,0,1.0,False
1g35hjm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g35hjm,Favorites from the BI (6 nights),"We just (sadly) returned from 6 nights on the Big Island and I just wanted to highlight my favorite things!

We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. Waikoloa is about 30 ish minutes from Kona (which isn’t that far to me since my daily commute is longer). It’s a nice home base if you want to be around resorts and other tourists, but definitely lacks the authentic local feel that Kona or smaller towns have. There are two shopping centers, restaurants, and the Gourmet Market was great for getting groceries and snacks. There’s also golf courses, a mini golf course, petroglyphs, walking trails, and public beach access. 

The resort itself was a bit pricey, which should be obvious since it was a Hilton, but it was nice. The resort itself is HUGE with 3 different hotel blocks combined into one resort. There is a tram to get from one side to the other, but there is a lot of walking even just from the parking lot to your room (pro tip: you can cut from the parking lot past the tennis court and up through the spa to save time). There are two pools with a few water slides, a small adult only pool (in the middle of one of the towers so it’s not very private) and the saltwater lagoon. We never had a problem getting chairs around the pool, and towels were readily available. Chairs are limited around the lagoon, but there’s plenty of grass space to set down a blanket or towels so it wasn’t a problem for us. There are also rentable cabanas at each of the pools and the lagoon. The lagoon also offers rentable paddle boards, canoes, paddle boats, etc. We really enjoyed the lagoon the most - it felt more relaxing and there was tons of snorkeling opportunities. We saw lots of turtles, manta rays, and fish. The water was also slightly warmer than the pools, which were a lot colder than I was expecting them to be. We bought cheap inflatables from ABC and spent hours just floating around the lagoon (BRING A HAT).

We had a King room in the Makai building with a balcony overlooking the lagoon. We could also see the dolphins from the balcony which was fun. The room itself was fine - nothing too crazy. Plenty of room, comfy bed, nice bathroom with walk-in shower. The AC worked great and there was a mini fridge for leftovers (which it just froze everything but oh well). We did not try any of the restaurants at the resort because the prices were absolutely crazy and we’d rather spend that money on eating at local places ($60 curry?? $80 pizza????). They do offer some room service but it’s crazy prices + 20% auto gratuity + $15 delivery fee. There are plenty of places to get food off resort within 10-15 min. We did get coffee multiple times at the coffee bar despite it being a $9 because their Hawaiian Latte was so good 😂. 

A bonus of the resort for us was that the spa offered hotel guests a $25 day pass to use the locker rooms, showers, sauna, whirlpool and steam room. Our flight out was at 8pm, so it was nice that even though we had to check out at 11am, we could still enjoy an entire extra day at the lagoon and be able to shower and refresh before heading to the airport. 

Favorite things we did:

- We did a day trip to Volcano National Park. We left at 7am, drove south around the bottom of the island, and got to VNP at about 10am. We stopped at Punalu’u Black Sand beach on the way and it was amazing - great place to spend a day if you’re looking for a black sand beach. Once at the park, the visitor center parking was full so we drove a bit further and parked at the Steam Vents. We saw a sign to walk out to the steam bluffs, which we followed, and while we expected to have some view of Kilauea, we had no idea we’d walk right up to the edge of the caldera. The views are spectacular. We followed the crater rim trail from Steam Bluffs up to the Jaggar Museum (closed) which is about 2 miles each way. It was a pretty easy hike (only slight inclines with 50/50 paved and unpaved trail) with great look outs along the way. There are also multiple parking lots along the way if you’re unable to walk the trail. We peaked into the visitor center, but we were hungry so we decided to drive into Hilo for lunch (which is about 30 minutes away). We would have saved a lot of driving time if we had just brought a lunch but we didn’t have a way to keep anything cold. I definitely recommend packing a lunch instead as Hilo was not worth the trip. After lunch, we drove back to the park to check out Thurston Lava tube. It was about 4pm when we got back so there was plenty of parking as most people had left by then. It was nice to enjoy it mostly alone. It’s a super short hike and will only take about 20 minutes to see the whole thing (stairs and steep inclines, but paved). We drove home through Hilo and heading back west along highway 200 past Mauna Kea, which is about an hour less travel time (caution: sudden fog a mist in parts and steep decline on the west slope). It was really interesting to see how the landscape and foliage changed constantly wherever we drove on the island. It’s many different ecosystems all right next to each other!

- Thanks to many recommendations from this sub, we booked the Sunset and Stargazing tour of Mauna Kea with Hawaii Forest & Trail. Do yourself a favor and BOOK THIS TOUR if you want to see Mauna Kea. Our tour guide, Jason, was great and had lots of great knowledge and stories to tell. I can’t even describe how incredible the views are at the summit and how amazing the observatories are. Dinner (stew or chili) was included along with hot cocoa and the most incredible shortbread cookies (more info below) and they had parkas and blankets to help keep you warm once the sun goes down (it got into the 30’s). Keep in mind that the top of the mountain is about 13,000 feet, which can be a bit hard for most people who aren’t used to high altitude. We both felt a bit dizzy and wobbly so it’s important to move carefully and stay hydrated. With the telescopes we were able to see Venus, Saturn, a binary star pair, star clusters, the andromeda galaxy, and of course the inconveniently bright moon (plan your trip for a new moon 😂). We could also see the Milky Way, multiple constellations, and shooting stars with the naked eye. Jason was again great with pointing out different things and explaining how the Hawaiian people used the stars for navigation and explaining their stories surrounding different stars and constellations.

You can drive up to the observatories yourself, but I would 100% absolutely not encourage you to try unless you are experienced with off road driving. 4x4 is REQUIRED as the trail is mostly unpaved, extremely bumpy and uneven, and dangerously steep (steepest grade is 30%). There were a plethora of rented jeeps making the drive - but our tour guide pointed out the the majority of rental companies specifically outline in their contracts that using the cars like this voids the rental agreement so if you get in trouble your insurance and their insurance will NOT cover you. There are also no close medical options and the altitude is too high for Med-evac.

The only downside to our trip to Mauna Kea were the  many “influencers” disrespecting the area to make their dumb videos for social media 🤦🏼‍♀️.

- We also drove up north to the Kohala area which had lots of cute towns with little shops. We had lunch in Hawi and saw the King Kamehameha statue. 

Restaurants we ate at (by area):

Waikoloa:

- Big Island Fireart: great Chinese food for reasonable prices

- Smash Daddy burgers: delicious smash burgers (customizable toppings) and shakes

- Foster’s Kitchen: went for a super later dinner and it was one of the only things open, but I had a really great Thai Chicken Salad

- Gypsea Gelato: lots of flavor interesting flavor options (don’t be like me a get a medium - it’s too much 😂)

- We tried to go to Tropics Alehouse but they stop seating anyone else an hour before they close (even at the bar) and the host was kind of rude about it so we didn’t try going back

Kona:

- Kona Brewing: went here after landing as a place to get a quick bite while we figured out where to begin our journey. Food was good - had pepperoni rolls and Kalua Pork Tacos - but definitely won’t be missing anything if you don’t stop here

- Izakaya Shiono - this was probably the best meal we had the entire trip. Amazing, fantastic quality sushi and Japanese food. The best Katsu I’ve ever had…? A great choice if you love Japanese food!!

- 808 Grindz Cafe - the best Loco Moco we had the whole week. Authentic, local joint. They are cash only!!! We only figured this out after getting there but there’s a pharmacy up the street with an ATM. I want to go back just to try the coconut pancakes with Vanilla Mac sauce!

- Fish Hopper - great view of the water right on the bay in Kona. Second best Loco Moco we had (great gravy!), my burger was just alright - nothing special. I’ve heard they have good drinks too but we didn’t partake while there.

- Island Lava Java: we went here for breakfast twice on our trip. The first time I had the eggs Benedict which was served on a toasted croissant (!) and had fantastic homemade hollandaise, my husband had the Kalua Pork scramble which he really enjoyed. The second time I just had the Basic Breakfast (the quality of food was far less good this time 😕) and he had the island style pancakes (bananas, macadamia nuts, coconut sauce) and they were really good. 

Hawi:

- Bamboo Restaurant & Gallery: this was recommended to me by a friend and I’m so glad we went. It’s such a cute little place, the food was great (get the chicken saté gyoza) and the Lilikoi iced tea has been on my mind since

Miscellaneous stuff:

- The absolute best shortbread we had on our tour came from Mrs. Barry’s cookies in Kona. They are right over by Costco. We ended up going there on our last day and stocking up before we headed back (you can also order online)

- We noticed many places during the week stop serving breakfast by 10am so keep this in mind if you like sleeping in. Additionally, many restaurants close by 9-10pm so there’s not a ton of later night options outside of bars. 

- There were no mosquitoes at all. I’m not sure what I expected but I was super surprised. We honestly saw way less bugs than I thought  tropical island would have (except one giant cockroach by the brewery)

- Speed limits on the island are super slow, but I’ve read other accounts of people getting tickets for going barely over so we were cautious. We saw almost no cops the first half of the week and then we realized they all drive absolutely unmarked 4Runners which blend in. We even saw one cop in an older Honda Pilot. 

- Kona is the best for souvenir shopping. They have a farmer’s market a couple days a week, and there’s a little market called Ali’i Garden Markets that we got some goodies at

So a few weeks ago I (m36) managed to build up the courage to ask out a woman who works at my local grocery store where I do most of my shopping. She said yes which was a shock to me as so far every woman I've asked has said no and/or that I'm too good of a friend etc. We exchanged numbers and she seemed surprised and interested when I asked.

We were talking a bit over text, and I had asked her if she would like to go out for coffee or lunch sometime, something casual and with no real implications other than getting to know each other with the possibility of dating. We somewhat shared our work schedule to try and set a time for a possible lunch or coffee date. Her schedule was not as concrete as mine, so I had told her to let me know when she was available.

Things kept coming up for her, and over a few weeks we didn't text much, maybe once every other day, and I was the one always initiating the conversations. After talking for a bit one night she sent a fairly long and very vulnerable text about how she had just ended a long term relationship that had become toxic, and had also recently went out with a guy who was also possibly abusive in some way (she did not go into detail and I did not ask). She did mention that she wasn't sure if she was interested in dating right now as she didn't want to be hurt again which is absolutely fair.  
  
I then shared quite a bit of personal/vulnerable information as well to try to diffuse the situation and to hopefully make her feel at ease. We ended up talking way more that night than we had the entire week before, and I felt like there may have been some connection as we did have some things in common.

I asked her again if she would be interested in going to coffee just to talk, with zero intention of dating, just so we could both get more comfortable. She agreed and we had set a date and time. The morning of the day in question, she sends me a text saying she was being called into work and had to cancel, and asked me again which days I usually have off, which I told her. That day also happened to be the day that I also do most of my chores and errands as well as my weekly grocery shopping.

When I went for my normal shopping around the time she said she would be working as I have been for years, I did not see her at all in the store, and she is usually one of the front end cashiers. My immediate thought was that she had lied to me, and for some reason just couldn't or wouldn't tell me the truth.

I haven't contacted her at all since that day, and she has not messaged me either. At this point I'm not going to send any more texts, as I feel like I got the hint that she is actually not interested in anything at all. I'm still not sure if she had actually lied, or for some reason just wasn't doing her normal job that day, but this is a huge blow to my ego as I've never actually had a woman say yes to me asking them out. I'm just not sure why she would do this as I tend to see her a couple of times a week when I go shopping and I feel seeing her will be very awkward.

**TLDR:** I'm not sure if I was lied to and ghosted after asking a woman out as she cancelled last minute and was not at her job when I went in for weekly grocery shopping where she works.",0,1728870574.0,dating,4,0.5,False
1g35d8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1g35d8p/cant_help_but_feel_like_i_messed_up/,Can’t help but feel like I messed up. ,"I’m probably gonna delete this. But for now I need to let out what’s in my head. Venting sounds like the wrong word cuz I’m not mad just upset in a sad way. 

So I 30mtf match with this wonderful gal 24mtf, probably 2 3 weeks ago. 
At first the conversations was hit and miss. Then about a week and a half ago it really kicked off. We have soo much in common. We love cars we both ride motorcycles which is a huge plus because I’m neck deep in motorcycles it’s an addiction. 

Everything was super respectful, didn’t really talk about sex except for a few innuendos. Which for me it was a huge relief and pleasure because I’m pan and sometimes match with men which ugh doesn’t get far because all they want is sex. 

A lot of the time we were talking it was like I was talking to myself Like omg girl same noo way. To the point I felt like I had to hold back saying that so I didn’t sound toxic ( idk how to describe why) we would stay up all night texting eachother way past bedtimes. 
I felt giddy every time my phone dinged that she texted me. 
We eventually decided to have a date at a cafe then plan to watch a movie at her place. 

I feel like here’s where it went down hill. 

The day before the date I confessed my dating profile name was a fake name, it was actually an old name I used before settling on my now permanent prefered name. 

I explained I did it for safety. I’ve had a rough history in the past, so for safety I have a few personal rules I don’t give my number out and I don’t give out my actual name until I meet in person and it goes well. I’ve had a few sour dates that I was thankful I kept to that rule. 

She was taken back but understood. She explained that she was taken back because she felt I didn’t trust her and it gave old triggers from her ex. 
She prior had said had a rough break up with her ex and was without saying it directly was still dealing with the blow from that rough relationship. 

After I confessed the conversations died down abit. 
But she was still super excited for the date. 

Yesterday was the date. I drove out and met her. We went to a town Halloween event, it was crowded and unfortunately aimed towards young family’s with toddlers which we didn’t know that detail. 

Before I walked up to her I could see she was dissociated. Something I use todo all the time prior to feeling comfortable with myself out in public. 

We ordered coffee and sat down. 
Having a conversation with her was like pulling teeth she kept her cup of coffee to her mouth so she didn’t have to speak staring out the window in what I would I assume nervous dissociating. I couldn’t help but smile she was sooooooo beautiful 😻 omg thinking about seeing her in my head how she looked I can’t help but smile. 
Her profile pictures did no justice.

We finished our coffees and went to walk around the vendors event. She barely spoke as much as tried to interact with her. Just looking distant. 

We reached the end of the vendors event which wasn’t long and she stopped and looked down at me and apologized. Saying I’m sorry I can’t do this can’t do this I’m sorry you drove out this way. 
We hugged good bye and I said no worries maybe another time. 
Btw she’s taller than me which is rare cuz I’m 5’10 in flats IM THE SHORT QUEEN, It felt amazing. I went home and again said maybe next time we can try again where’s it not crowded. She apologized saying it wasn’t my fault she was just in a bad spot emotionally and shouldn’t have planned anything that week because of it but also doesn’t wanna meet up with anyone again for a while.

Since then the conversations have been short and not much. Trying to talk to her feels forced, I try to suggest maybe we could bake something. Also saying how today’s weather would’ve been perfect cuddle weather which prior to the date she would’ve loved to hear and say yess it be great to prove how good of a cuddler she is. Now it’s nothin. 


I feel like I fucked up some how. Idk where but it does. I really like this girl I haven’t felt this connection ever before. I don’t wanna stop talking to her or give up. But the conversations have practically died. I just wanna give her a warm hug and apologize for whatever I did if I did anything. 

Any advice on what I should do ? 
Sorry if there’s a speach impediment in my long rabble and how long this was.

They crash at the station, and wake up on Halloween to find a press conference brewing. While outside drinking coffee, Snake sees red strings in the sky leading to a point near town. He tells Danger he’s going to investigate, while Danger works to prep for the conference. 

As Snake drives out, following the strings, he gets a call on the Cowboys burner phone from Agent Wu. He says they found a series of similar murders in a California Hooverville in 1933, the last being a man who cut off his hand with a strange tattoo but died of blood loss. Agent Wu also convinces Snake to not go alone to face a potential threat, before Snake finds his phone has turned into a toy prop. 

Meanwhile, Danger gets a call from the Program saying that they matched the wood sample to a 1995 case where previous agents found fire to be the most effective weapon—despite being merely an approximation of wood, it still burns like the stuff. They also press to collect Derek Dengler’s box and tell Danger he cannot appear on TV at the conference. Instead, Danger coaches Deputy Clint through the process and manages to get Halloween moved to a daytime trunk-or-treat at a Church and quell the chaos. 

Meeting back up, the Agents drive to a local diner, but Snake’s perspective is wrong due to his decreasing grasp on reality, perceiving the diner as a 2D cutout. He lightly crashes the car, drawing the attention of Saucerwatch members Greta and Will. They go inside the diner together and the Agents manage to convince the alien enthusiasts to stay inside tonight, though Snake sees Greta’s face as a mask. 

The Agents gear up with makeshift molotov cocktails and follow the strings back out to an abandoned pumpkin farm. Guns and improvised weapons out, they approach to find a marionette standing like a scarecrow in the field. Getting closer, they trigger its attention, and though Snake hits it with a cocktail it grabs Danger. Both on fire, it begins to lift him in the air, and Snake holds on. They break free and fall from a significant height into the field, the hay barely breaking their fall. Snake is roughed up, but Danger is burned and broken nearly to the point of death. They call in an ambulance and fake another attack from the serial killer, and narrowly avoid an impromptu interview with newscaster Enrico Save literally ambulance chasing. 

They stop briefly at the police station, as Sarah Harrogate has committed suicide, her only note being “I have no strings.” The Agents decide Danger needs to go to a hospital, only to be met by the Friendly they recruited, Marie Reynolds. Quitting her job as a ranger medic, she’s started working in a hospital, and was called out to keep watch on the Agents by the suspicious Program. She accompanies them to the hospital where she’s filled in. 

At the hospital, Snake and Danger part ways. Snake trauma dumps on Marie, losing his cool and spilling the truth about the unnatural and everything about Delta Green except the schism. They decide to stake out the Dengler house, where they find everything normal. As Marie reads through more of Derek’s journals, Snake talks to Thomas who now believes he is somehow tied to all the deaths. Snake reassures him he isn’t. 

As they leave, Thomas’ worries are silenced by his mother Eloise, and Thomas gets angry at her. Almost immediately, Snake sees multiple sets of red strings descend from the sky. Hiding in the car, Snake and Marie see a fresh marionette approach the Dengler’s door, clearly targeting the mother. Missing their shots, Snake sets it on fire and Marie grabs a chainsaw from the Dengler’s garden shed, ripping it in half. The severed part falls limp as the top is reeled back in. 

Eloise and Thomas let them inside as Snake sees more and more marionettes descend from the sky. Contemplating hiding Thomas, Snake tells Marie he’s sorry and goes to shoot the boy. Marie tries to intervene but fails, and Eloise stands in the way. Snake shoots her. Marie tries again to no avail. Thomas tries to run, but Snake shoots him through the throat. It is a painful death, cut short by Snake firing twice. Immediately, the strings and hallucinations dissipate. 

Snake moves to burn the house and all the evidence, while a shocked Marie realizes Eloise is still alive and stabilizes her. Marie carries her out of the house while Snake steals the car and drives off, sirens approaching. Marie is able to spin a story of another killer attack. 

Snake makes it back to the hospital where he finds Danger. He tells him what happened, and Danger is shaken in their partnership that he killed Thomas. Snake offers that he’s going on the run, but Danger refuses to join. They agree that they’ve got their dead drop if they ever need each other. 

Six months later, Gabriel Knight has been framed as the Glenridge Grinder by planting Lauren’s diary and is undergoing an extensive trial. Snake has fled to Nova Scotia, where he uses a phone booth to call the Cowboys, and they reassure him he made the right call, though it never lessened the weight. Snake asks if there’s a mission. They reply “there’s always the Mission.” Snake hangs up and returns to the bar he’s living out of, where he holds a cigarette lighter flame to his arm to see if it’s real or fake.

Danger is walking in New York City with his son. He’s gone back to the Program, but is using his own judgment to destroy and contain the unnatural where he can. His new partner is Marie, elevated to being a full agent. But for now he’s reconnecting with his son, but when they pass a toy store with a wooden puppet, he ushers his son past. 

We see a landlady showing a new tenant into Clyde Buckman’s apartment. We see a support group formed from the survivors of the ranch disaster with Polk, Ferio, and the Phenomenon X team. We see Greta and Will of Saucerwatch gaining traction in fringe circles as they show off blurry videos of a dark “saucer” shape seemingly moving against the sky. We see Eloise Dengler in recovery, scared into silence, yet dwelling on revenge against those that took her boy from her. We see the faintest edges of Gol-Goroth, the Fisher of Men, a predatory god reaching across dimensions for food to sate its endless hunger. 

And we see a father and his son on the other end of New York, walking in Central Park. It’s Ian and Brandon McGill, enjoying their time together. The Program didn’t lie. They really were trying to help.

1. The Stew Crew had to take to social media this week and post a serious black screen story apologizing for… not releasing a new vlog. The fans were getting restless so Evan finally quit playing with the Duggars and threw up a vlog showing him purchasing goods to help out hurricane victims. He leaves the serious business to their playboy pastor who excitedly explains that every single item they are sending will have a tract from the church attached. Awesome news bc people really needed to line their bird cages. Seize the moment you know. Anyway, the black screen also tells us how sorry the Stewart’s are for the hurricane victims. This is super important bc they are jetting off to the Florida panhandle for a beach vacay and don’t plan to focus on that pesky little storm happening just a bit further down from them. Carlin tells us she doesn’t know why they missed last year’s family vacation, but that isn’t important bc they are back this year and ready to exploit their kids and their parents for a solid week. The in-laws must have set some boundaries bc there was lots of tight shots and filming outside of the home.  Evan’s brother Ethan was there in the background, hanging on like a third wheel. Layla and Zade have no days off… this was a work trip for them in matching swimsuits. Layla in a bikini and Zade shirtless. I wonder why Carlin and Evan don’t film themselves dressed like their kids? Zade gets left behind while the rest of the fam film an electric bike commercial and we see several shopping trips where the kids get new toys. There is lots of Evan and Layla walking on the beach content bc isn’t that so precious and Zade tries to build a sand castle. They put Zade to work with the GoPro camera but he just babbles and mumbles while the entire family screams out what he is supposedly saying. Layla finally grabs the camera and attempts to teach her brother how to speak. It’s a full on speech therapy session conducted by a 4 year old and that girl is the only one who gets it. Turn the camera off and help your child! Soon enough it’s time to head home but not before Carlin calls herself a “crab girlie” at a seafood buffet. That doesn’t mean what you think it means Mrs. Stewart. They tell Nini, Poppa and the gang goodbye and head off to Tennessee without another word about the hurricane.

2. Katie and Travis debuted part 2 of the exploitation of infant Harvey. The wildest thing is that the moment he was born and placed on Katie… she told him to keep breathing. You could hear everyone in the background telling her that he was fine… obviously her Mother’s intuition kicked in bc moments later… they whisked him away. Anyway, she also says they are keeping him away from lots of people and then proceeds to show 10-12 people holding and kissing and snuggling him so she isn’t up for mom of the year. Travis’ parents are sent to care for Hailey and apparently Carlin held his son before Travis ever got to. Baby Harvey made a fast recovery and the NICU sent the Clarks and their cameras home. They release a reel showing Hailey meeting the baby that has over a thousand comments and 5000 shares just on IG. The reel is heavily edited and Travis is able to make it seem like a real Hallmark moment. It was back to work for Katie bc influencing never stops. She pretended to answer questions so she could sling links. Everything is perfect, wonderful, amazing, love and light in her newborn love bubble. How long until it is popped by the realities of life with 2 under 2?

3. Josie Balka and fam  continue to star in a Nora Ephron movie. They are in Vermont, in a fancy, modern air bnb, showing sweeping mountains and glorious fall foliage. The girls have perfect braids and beige sweaters and baby Miles is chunky sweetness in his carhart. They have cider and pumpkins and coffee and doughnuts and hay rides and… YAWN. It’s all SO perfectly boring. Josie uses this whole trip as a photo shoot and there just isn’t one thing candid or real. Her Effortless Shop features a reel of her with the Langdon girls in pool noodles. She still finds time to hide out in the bathroom to sell prime day deals and Kelton is cheffing it up. While the Balkas taste test maple syrups, Josie says she can’t stop thinking about Florida. I know Floridians appreciated that.

4.  Alyssa posted family pictures at the beach on her grid. Rhett is screaming his head off in them but Alyssa posts them anyway. With Hurricane Milton barreling towards her, she decided to hop a plane to Utah for a fashion show from her favorite Mormon matchy matchy brand. Even though the company is all about Mommy and Me… Alyssa took a friend and left Allie and the girls in the dust. She was beyond excited to be away from her suburban prison and pranced all around Utah taking pictures. The fashion show was full of moms and their daughters and was geared towards family outfits. Alyssa spent one night and then hightailed it to the airport. She decided to show us what was in her goodie bag from the show while she was IN the airport bathroom. The flushing toilet really sent me… until I watched her ooh and aahh over a PINK BASEBALL CAP featuring the company’s logo. She said she might even wear THAT cap and I was done for. Speaking of the hat… one of her friends took a picture with her children in the sad hat and Alyssa posted it. Guess her friends are trying to sell the sad hats more than she is at this point. She got back in time for the storm which knocked out their power. It didn’t stop her from shilling those $200 sheets or snapping filtered pics of Rhett where his nose is basically missing. Soon enough all was back to normal and we see her empty coffee cup that she says Lawson bought her while he was “in town”. Glad she remembered his name. Still high from her hang with the Mormons, Alyssa dresses her girls up in burgundy tablecloths, puts Rhett in a Temu Willie Olsen fit and forces her family to take fall pictures in the 88° Florida heat. 

5. Whitney says Jackson and Emy stayed with them for the Duggar wedding. I guess no one wants to stay at the big house… not even Kelly Joe. While Whitney is promoting a 25% off sale at BSB, someone asks for a link to the shirt she is wearing… it’s American Eagle. Whitney shows off a steaming pot of chili and says Zach makes the best one she has ever eaten. Zach is back in the Bates Kitchen this week but he isn’t making chili. Instead we get his version of Cheddar Broccoli Soup, otherwise known as Cheese Bog. Zach full on cries tears while cutting an onion and once he is finished sniffling and snorting we have to watch him practice using a knife for way too long. Can’t he do his prep before recording? Later he adds too much butter and doesn’t explain the heat correctly. Finally he slops it all in a bowl and slurps it up while in a flour covered apron. We can’t see what is in the bowl bc there are still no dern closeups. Every week this man is at war with food. It’s a masterpiece.

6. Lydia shares tons of Hawaii content all week. We see cliffs and falls and shaved ice and the 2 of them cruising in a convertible Camaro. At the end of the week they release a vlog asking people to guess where they are going. So well thought out. Lydia wants to tell but she looks to Trace for permission to speak and he doesn’t give it. They rented a VRBO studio apartment and used airline points for their flights. Ryker is having a blast with  Lydia’s family and they are teaching him German. In real time, they are home from the trip and Lydia answers questions she asked herself about the trip on IG. She says her sister in law took care of Maui… which one?

7. This week Keilen Corner took a break from arts and crafts to give us all a tutorial on how to have quiet time with our Bible. The 2 quietest people teaching others how to be quiet was just a bridge too far and I found myself being lulled into an IBLP coma. They lure you in with the crayons and then bam! Next thing you know you are keeping sweet in a denim skirt. Whew.

8. Lawson spent another week riding around in helicopters looking for photo opportunities with Medicorp. He sent Tiffy to Arkansas to be with Esther and Nate as they welcomed their new son Graham Alan Bates. Tiffy seemed stoked to be there and we see Kenna pushing baby Will in his stroller. Tiffy shows JebJud and says he is the blonde Lawson. I don’t know why she is cursing that child. We get lots of content of baby Will next to baby Graham. Back in Nashville Tiff has her parents come and stay with her and she shows old footage of her dad teaching Lawson to cook. Tiffy seems worried that their influencing game is suffering without Lawson around to act a fool. In reality, she is coming into her own showing lots of cute baby footage. Will is cooing and laughing and smiling and Tiff has to pack away his newborn clothes . Now is your chance Tiffy… break and run!

9. Erin was able to finagle her phone away from Chadmonster just long enough to say she evacuated to Tennessee. We don’t know where or for how long or if it was even for the storm. No clue how the swamp compound fared through the storm.

10.  Bits and Bytes… BSB is selling a $60 sweatshirt with the boutique name on the front. Carlin is going to show Alyssa how it is done…Kelly Joe spent the week at the farm bc JaneJane had skin cancer removed from her nose. No Gil sighting…Carlin, Michael and Josie all post “Pray For Florida”… Kelly commented “nice pic” on Alyssa’s beach family photo. No comment from Alyssa…. BSB is now selling a full line of shoes. 

Have a great week friends!

1g351mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BringingUpBates/comments/1g351mj/breaking_down_bates/,Breaking Down Bates,"1. The Stew Crew had to take to social media this week and post a serious black screen story apologizing for… not releasing a new vlog. The fans were getting restless so Evan finally quit playing with the Duggars and threw up a vlog showing him purchasing goods to help out hurricane victims. He leaves the serious business to their playboy pastor who excitedly explains that every single item they are sending will have a tract from the church attached. Awesome news bc people really needed to line their bird cages. Seize the moment you know. Anyway, the black screen also tells us how sorry the Stewart’s are for the hurricane victims. This is super important bc they are jetting off to the Florida panhandle for a beach vacay and don’t plan to focus on that pesky little storm happening just a bit further down from them. Carlin tells us she doesn’t know why they missed last year’s family vacation, but that isn’t important bc they are back this year and ready to exploit their kids and their parents for a solid week. The in-laws must have set some boundaries bc there was lots of tight shots and filming outside of the home.  Evan’s brother Ethan was there in the background, hanging on like a third wheel. Layla and Zade have no days off… this was a work trip for them in matching swimsuits. Layla in a bikini and Zade shirtless. I wonder why Carlin and Evan don’t film themselves dressed like their kids? Zade gets left behind while the rest of the fam film an electric bike commercial and we see several shopping trips where the kids get new toys. There is lots of Evan and Layla walking on the beach content bc isn’t that so precious and Zade tries to build a sand castle. They put Zade to work with the GoPro camera but he just babbles and mumbles while the entire family screams out what he is supposedly saying. Layla finally grabs the camera and attempts to teach her brother how to speak. It’s a full on speech therapy session conducted by a 4 year old and that girl is the only one who gets it. Turn the camera off and help your child! Soon enough it’s time to head home but not before Carlin calls herself a “crab girlie” at a seafood buffet. That doesn’t mean what you think it means Mrs. Stewart. They tell Nini, Poppa and the gang goodbye and head off to Tennessee without another word about the hurricane.

2. Katie and Travis debuted part 2 of the exploitation of infant Harvey. The wildest thing is that the moment he was born and placed on Katie… she told him to keep breathing.

Maddock O’Donnelly was old. Older than he had any right to be. He was cursed, along with his sister, brother and two friends to a life of immortal servitude. Well, all except Cardinal, as he was called to his service from death. But for Maddock, Raien, Elbee and Spazferd they were condemned to service, driven to the bidding of their curses. Spazferd was made an insatiable detective, always thirstring to find those lying to gain more. Elbee was driven to a form of paranoia and loneliness, afraid of contact with anyone outside his family and friends. Maddock and Raine were both cursed with some form of wrath, hence the name that accompanied their legend; The Family of Wrath. For Maddock it was Vengeance, he would take in the last moments of a victim’s life or feel the evil off of monstrous people and then he was compelled to kill. Raine was less capable of sensing such powerful emotions, but when she was angered her wrath was anyone’s and everyone’s undoing.

He had spent many years of his existence, he couldn’t call it life, running and hiding from people out of fear of hurting those around him. Only twice, in recent memory, was he drawn out from the shadows he called a home. Once in the 1940’s he began a slaughter that most people still couldn’t explain, through the countryside of German occupied France. He still couldn’t recall what he had done, but even Raine refused to talk about it so he didn’t push to find out. The last time was during the Purge War, he couldn't let humanity face its end alone and for a short time during that war the curse seemed to lift, he could help people and do things he never thought he could. For a short time he had been a hero. Then when another was called upon to make a sacrifice he took it in the man’s place, the coward had nearly killed an entire platoon to save face and leave Maddock behind. Maddock faced that fight with what little faith and dignity he had left, and now he was awake again decades later in a world that felt just slightly to the left of what he had sacrificed for.

Awakening had left him in a deep spiral of guilt and depression as the act of doing so had caused a chasm to open violently in the center of Dross City and it was during an attack. An attack, much to his horror, that Maddock had eventually learned had been made to find and destroy his resting form. Instead it had spurred his awakening. He still wasn’t at full strength, but he was stronger than he had any right to be after being atomized by an exploding engine. He hated that more than anything.

He had been spending the last few weeks recovering with his family and friends. Cardinal had made it a point to visit him daily to make sure he was at least acting like he wanted to recover. Maddock appreciated the kindness, Cardinal’s position as the Revenant of Loyalty aside, he was truly a good friend. But he hadn’t showed up this morning, he had sent a text about stopping Spaz from buying something stupidly overpriced and specific. Maddock had a feeling there was more to it, but he took the opportunity to go for a walk. And that was the last thing he recalled before reality spun back to him as he was throwing a man out of a restaurant and into the sleeting afternoon of Dross City.

A few claps pulled his attention to the inside of the restaurant. A few customers were showing their approval of tossing the man out. Maddock blushed and slid over to the booth, he knew he was at the Bodhi Tree Grill but he had no idea how he had gotten there. Other than walking that is. He sighed as he realized he had dissociated yet again. It had become common in the days and nights since his awakening.

“Hey.” A cheerful voice said. 

Maddock looked up to see a dark skinned woman, one of the kids who helped her parents run the restaurant, she was in a bright yellow top with a brown smock that held a notepad and pen. She had flaming red hair that, as far as Maddock could tell, was natural. She had a pleasant smile and was holding a glass of water.

“You okay? I know he socked you in the jaw so I got you some water.” The woman’s name tag read “Karma”.

Maddock nodded, “Thanks.” He had meant to cover his accent, but it slipped out like a cat from a child’s arms. “Sorry to cause a scene.” 

“You didn’t do anything, Seven C’s are always the problem.” Karma smiled, “So my name is Karma, as the name tag says. Papa says you can have a meal free tonight.” 

Maddock nodded, “Thanks. Just some butter chicken curry. Non-spicy if possible.” 

Karma laughed, “We can do that. Where are the others you’re usually with?”

“Sister and brother are out, friends are making fools of themselves without me.” Maddock tried to force a smile but it felt like he was simply stretching his skin over his face.  

Karma slid into the seat opposite of him. “Are you okay? We can call an ambulance.”

Maddock shook his head, “It ain’t the knock to the head. Just my demons screaming’ through my ugly nob of a skull.” He closed his eyes and angry accusing faces stared back at him and he flung his eyes back open again.

“I know the attacks were rough, I guess you went through hell, huh?” Karma nodded, “S.A.F.E. has councilors, good ones. Gabby, my sister, has been seeing them. Let me get that Curry for you.” She stood up and left for a few minutes.

Maddock took a breath and tried to center himself. Raine had tried to teach him more than a few times, but he never did take to it properly. He heard a plate being sat down in front of him and he opened his eyes to see Karma taking off her smock and sitting down with her own plate.

“Hope you don’t mind, it’s my lunch time, and you seemed lonely.” Karma said.

Maddock was silent for a few moments, but nodded as he started to slowly eat. He and his family had found the place to be enjoyable and the food was always good. It was no different this time, except he was eating with someone new.

“Thank you, but you don’t have to.” Maddock smiled weakly.

“It’s all right, sometimes we just need another person to see we exist.” Karma smiled, “Small things ripple to huge waves.”

Maddock blinked as he absorbed the words, then went back to silently eating. When he looked up again Karma was neatly finishing her meal and smiling back at him. 

“It was nice to eat with you.” Karma smiled, “You’re always welcome here.” 

“Thanks.” Maddock nodded as he finished his own meal.

“I’ll take that back.” Karma smiled, “Your brother is adorable by the way.” 

“He’s a turd.” Maddock sighed, “Likes to get in to trouble hacking into things he shouldn’t”

“Ah, a little trouble maker.” Karma chuckled, “Well I hope he isn’t doing bad things then.” 

“Aways is.” Maddock laughed, “But he won’t leave his room most days. The world scares him and I can hardly blame him.” 

Karma was clearly and briefly saddened but nodded. “You know where to take him at least. They might have a program for agoraphobics.” 

Maddock didn’t say anything but stood and nodded, then offered his hand.

Karma quickly shook it.

“Maddock O’Donnelly.” He smiled back.

“Well if the accent didn’t give it away, that name sure did.” Karma chuckled.

Maddock snorted and paused, he hadn’t laughed genuinely in a long time. It had caught him off guard. 

Karma was beaming at him. “I know a real laugh when I hear one. Next time the demons come around, tell them to go bother someone else for a while, then come get a curry.” 

Maddock nodded, “I just might.” 

As he left the restaurant he heard an older woman shout out something he barely recalled to mean “scandalous” in Hindi. He smiled again and walked into the city. He walked for a few hours before returning to the apartment his family had taken to renting, they were always prepared with “inherited” funds from “older family members”, so it didn’t really cost them much. They had been saving since before the United States was a country. Maddock still remembered watching the Declaration being signed, granted the signers didn’t know he was there, but he was proud to watch it be signed. 

He walked in and found Elbee sitting on the couch, three laptops all opened to various sites. One was on the Charter Organization’s website. Another was on Union Heroica and the last one was opened to the Thrush Evolutionary Academy.

“What’s this one for?” Maddock asked as he picked it up and looked it over. “A school? We’ve lived most of modern history.”  

“Yeah.” Elbee nodded, “But I never got to go to a school.” 

Maddock paused and thought about it. His family had always been self-educated and raised to be killers and assassins. Elbee not only hadn’t ever gone to a school, but was taught by their father to shun such places.

“Lonely?” Maddock asked.

“Kinda.” Elbee nodded, “And tired of being so afraid. I just want to help people!” He tossed the laptop he was working on towards a wall, a shadow opened and Maddock caught it as it passed through and into his arms. 

Maddock looked the laptop over and handed it back. 

“Sorry. I’m just...” Elbee sniffled, “I get it now. Why you were so out of it for so long. You know when pirates were a thing.” 

Maddock grinned, “They still are.” 

Elbee blinked and opened the laptop and did a quick search, “Well that is weird.” 

“So what’s so big and important about this school?” Maddock asked.

“It’s for people who want to be heroes. But I can’t find a way around the physical exam and I don’t want to risk exposing us all.” Elbee sighed.

Maddock nodded, Revenants could fool humans into thinking they were alive on a surface level exam or to a passing scrutinous eye, but once a doctor and tests stepped in they were unable to do so. And very few things that were undead were considered friendly.

Maddock reached over and pulled his brother closer, into a hug. “You want to be a hero?” 

Elbee nodded, “Like we were then. I wasn’t afraid when we fought them, but then you left and it was all scary again.” 

“I’m sorry.” Maddock hugged his brother tighter, “I never meant to leave you all without an explanation.” 

“We know.” Elbee sighed, “Sir Immortalis the English Butt-face is to blame.” 

Maddock snorted a deep laugh, “He is.” 

“Don’t worry, it’s just a silly dream.” Elbee sighed again.

“Nah.” Maddock stood up and kneeled to face his brother. “Dreams save us. Dreams lift us up and transform us, you remember who said that?” 

“Superman, Action Comics Seven Seventy-five.” Elbee smiled, “Those are mostly gone you know. He’s only in museums now.” 

“Remember the rest of it?” Maddock asked. “And on my soul, I swear... until my dream of a world where dignity, honor and justice becomes the reality we all share, I'll never stop fighting. Now I can’t promise all the light and valor, but I can promise you I will find a way to get you into the school.” He nodded, “I promise that much.” 

“Don’t keep promises you can’t keep.” Elbee sighed. 

“Have I ever?” Maddock asked. “I came back, fifty odd years late, but I came back.” 

Elbee sniffled and nodded, “Do you think they’ll hate me?” 

“Well, you are a bit of a know it all turd.” Maddock smiled, “But they’ll learn to love it.” 

Elbee smiled, “I got a lead on where the Nazi shit-head went.” 

“Oh?” Maddock asked, “Is this one I pissed off?”

“I don’t know. I was getting people out of camps while you were stacking bodies. But I imagine he knew at least one of those corpses you made.” Elbee snorted and sighed, “We have seen way too much violence.” 

“Aye.” Maddock sighed and nodded.

“Aye.” Elbee let his accent slip just a little as he pulled up a map of the Atlantic Ocean.

**Saturday, April 1, 2079**

Salem was sitting on a stool at the Quains. They were celebrating both Jasmine and her father’s birthday. He was there at her request because she had just arrived back from South America and wanted to tell her family about who she had been seeing. The response was mixed, but not surprising. Her brothers delivered the usual brotherly threats. Her father merely made a dad joke but Salem knew the man was watching him closer from that moment on. It was the kids that surprised him, in a good way.

“Way to go Salem.” Agatha had clapped in support and made no jokes the entire time. It had momentarily worried the nosferatu. 

“Is Salem going to be a new uncle?” Anna asked.

Cassandra nodded and begged for Jazz to say “yes” along with Anna.

Jasmine, for her part, had quickly begun to regret sharing the information with her family.

“So, Aunt Jazz.” Danny asked as he sat next to Salem. “Was it the midnight games of chicken on motorcycles?” 

Salem thought for a moment, “Didn’t hurt.” 

“Honestly, I’m surprised Sawyer was able to keep it a secret.” Endara commented, “You’d think he’d be a little protective of you given how long you two have been friends.” 

“Precisely why he isn’t.” Salem started to explain before his phone went off and a few messages drew his attention. He quickly stood up and walked into the other room. 

The MechAnimals had just finished a large sweep of suspected GLOBAL hideouts. Each one was empty or trapped. He growled before walking back into the kitchen and sitting back on his stool. The sound of a whoopee cushion went off as he did so. 

“Okay, who’s the smart ass?” Salem grumbled.

Alan raised his hand and giggled. 

“Be glad you’re the boss.” Salem threw the emptied air bladder at Alan.

“That’s a lot more bitter than I’d expected you to be.” Alan said, “What’s got your guts?” 

Salem showed Alan his message. “Last of the spots we had are all coming up, meaning it’s a trap or more nothing. Honestly, I’m gonna need help on this one and I hate asking for help from pricks like him.” 

Alan arched his eyebrows in curiosity. 

“Cymaster.” Salem practically spat the name. “Sell out son of a bitch.” 

“Still in a coma.” Stephen added, “Well partially, his mind is currently hooked into his cyberspace matrix conversion thing.” 

Salem blinked, “The Web-Runner?” 

“That one.” Stephen nodded, “I keep telling him we need to test it. It gives off radiation.” 

Salem sighed, “I’m gonna head that way now then.” 

“Need a ride?” Alan asked.

“Nah, sewers will do.” Salem grabbed his coat and loomed over Jasmine who had been watching her favorite El Tejon matches with Agatha and her father.

Jasmine looked up, slightly disappointed, but nodded in understanding. 

“Sorry. I actually want to stay, but this is lives on the line.” Salem bumped his head to hers and she gave his bald head a hug.

“Don’t kill the prick if he angers you.” Jazz warned, “Trident would hate that.” 

Salem chuckled as he grabbed an umbrella and headed to the sewage outlet where a pair of waders awaited him. Then he slowly made his way through the sewers and pipelines of Dross City. Many people were still unaware of just how spacious the sewers were, widened during the Purge War to make for places to hide, they were left alone just in case the Purge returned. Eventually he surfaced in the basement of the Central Specialized Hospital and stowed his traveling gear in a corner.

He made his way up in a way only a vampiric being could. His inhuman speed left a chilling breeze in his wake and papers flew around in a flurry. He stopped outside a far too neatly labeled door and knocked. 

“Come in.” A synthetic voice said from some old speaker. To Salem it sounded like an old toy his dad had once shown to him, one that had ignited his love for computers. 

Salem paused before opening the door, thoughts of his birth family had long been banished to a dark corner of his mind and the sudden, though not unpleasant memory was not something he had expected. He shook his head and brushed the memory away for the moment and opened the door.

“Stevens...” the robot voice seemed annoyed.

“Shove it Cy.” Salem closed the door, “We got a serious issue. I need a coder on par with me for this. Someone who knows how to code and problem solve.” 

“Flattery gets you places today.” Cymaster said, “As it happens I’m bored out of my skull and cyberspace.” 

“Good, cause this problem is pretty unique.” Salem put down his laptop and hooked it into CyMaster’s system.

“Catching data off a website isn’t unique.” CyMaster began, then he paused. “Wait...” 

“It doesn’t exist on any connection listed, you have to seriously know the old net to get to it.” 

“Fascinating. Whoever made this is as old as you or as smart as I am.” CyMaster dropped his speaker’s stylized speech. 

“Or both.” Salem said, “Can’t discount that.” 

“That would be unsettling.” CyMaster’s voice filtered through perfectly, a husky baritone that was barely above a whisper.

“But not impossible. So I need an old net data trap, one that’s hard to perceive.” Salem explained, “I know you know the infrastructure and how it’s being maintained nowadays, so you know it’s a hacker and criminal den.” 

CyMaster said nothing but Salem’s laptop began to flash programs on it’s screen. 

“Real fuckin’ creepy when you do that.” Salem grumbled.

“Surprised you didn’t go to Meissner.” CyMaster said, “He seems to be the big tech guy now.” 

“He’s hardware. I needed a code nerd.” Salem explained, “Only other code nerds I know who have this knowledge are dead or enemies.” 

“That is true.” CyMaster’s voice seemed to imply a smile. “Okay, this should be the base of what you need. It’d take an A.I. to even have a chance to notice it. I’ll leave the refinement to you.” 

“Thanks.” Salem said as he began to collect his laptop.

“And Salem.” CyMaster added, “It was good to see you again. I wish you would have considered coming back before joining Quain.” 

Salem paused again, “Quain’s history is better than the Charter’s. He hates lies and secrets, and hasn't lied to me once. The Org lied about me...” He put his laptop in his bag. “...can’t undo the past Cy.”

“Fair enough I guess.” Cymaster sighed. “By any chance have you asked the MechAnimals about their theft earlier this year?” 

“Unknown client used a drone to collect the drives.” Salem chuckled, “It is weird that hasn't come back to bite you all.” 

“I suspect they wanted very specific data that would be impossible to locate normally on the drives.” CyMaster admitted, “You would need a computer capable of quantum computing and a security clearance high enough to unlock the entire drive.” 

“So if they do unlock it, you all get another black eye.” Salem snorted with a smile.

“Honestly, I don’t know.” CyMaster said, “Those drives were made before I joined, I never had clearance to view them, that's why they were held off site, I didn't trust them.”

Salem nodded as he walked to the door, “Probably should have chosen a place with tighter security.” 

“The plan was to hide them in a place no one would expect.” CyMaster said, “Clearly someone figured it out.” 

Salem snorted and shook his head, “Yeah. Clearly.” 

Salem left the room and closed the door. He was happy to see that the sun had set, so he was able to simply grab a bus home. While on the bus a small child noticed him and tugged on his mother’s shirt, pointing at him. 

“Monster.” The kid said in a worried whisper.

“Honey, he’s just bald.” The mother smiled and patted the boy’s head. “Sorry.” 

“Kid’s got good instincts.” Salem smiled, flashing his teeth, “But wrong team kid.” 

The kid blinked. The mother pulled back in fear. 

“Not a monster?” The kid asked.

“I try not to be.” Salem smiled with his mouth closed, “We got enough of them nowadays.” He pulled out a small business card of his, it was in the shape of a black cat and he held it out for the kid. 

The boy reached out and grabbed it, then handed it to his mother. 

“Triple S Investigations.” She snickered at the name. “Wasn’t that a big company in the forties?” 

“Didn’t last long.” Salem smirked, “But it's what you do when all you have is hope.” 

“What?” The kid asked.

“Help people.” Salem said as his stop came up and he got off the bus with a wave. 

He walked up to the building and was surprised to see Sawyer talking with a dark skinned woman with a French-adjacent accent. He wasn’t sure why but it sounded familiar.

“Hey, Salem! Lady is looking to rent. Has all her ducks in a row and even a sponsor.” Sawyer laughed, “Ain’t seen anything like it.” He tapped the application on a clipboard he was holding. “This is great stuff.” 

“Yeah?” Salem held his hand out.

“Your superintendent’s sense of humor has much to be desired, but I am looking for housing for myself and my son. You have a two room apartment that is more than adequate on the third floor.” 

Salem looked the paperwork over and noted the last name, “Ava Leon...” He knew that surname, he just couldn’t place it. 

“Yes, Mr. Quain said you would be amenable to renting to us possibly.” Ava smiled.

Salem paused, the memory of Bull’s kid laughing flashed in his head. “His dad’s Bull?” 

Ava nodded, “Cameron isn’t perfect, but he’s doing better than I had expected.”

Salem pulled out a pen and made a few adjustments. “You’ll want the fourth floor. I keep the troublemakers on the third. They’re all loud and noisy jerks.” 

“Wasn’t I originally on the third floor?” Sawyer asked. 

“Like I said.” Salem smirked, “I’ll still need a first month’s rent, but I suspect given your sponsor that won't be an issue. You know when you want to move in?” 

“Once he’s out, if that's possible.” Ava smiled.

Salem nodded, “I’ll have the keys for you in a few days, you can move what you need in then. How many keys will you want in total? And mailroom keys?”

Ava blinked, “That’s very generous, but I guess the strongest hero does have some pull.” 

“Don’t make his head any bigger please.” Sawyer sighed. “Salem rents for people, not cash.” 

“Stop, I got a rep to uphold.” Salem snapped.

“Right, right.” Sawyer shook his head and whispered loudly to Ava, “He’s not really as grumpy as he seems.” 

Salem signed the document and handed it to Ava. “Welcome to the building, we got a website with message boards and chat rooms. It’ll be in your welcome packet after we sign the contracts.” 

Ava smiled, “Thank you Mr. Stevens!” She smiled and dashed off to a car.

“Bull’s wife?” Sawyer asked.

“Ex, I think.” Salem nodded, “Gotta work a bit, serious coding to do.” 

“Ah, that’s cool.” Sawyer nodded, “I found something I wanted to check out anyway.” 

“Should I expect a brutality report in the morning?’ Salem asked with a deep resigned sigh.

“Maaybe!” Sawyer laughed as he grabbed a golf bag full of bats and other sports paraphernalia and then ran off into the night. 

Salem walked into his apartment and put his keys on the giant wooden key he had inherited from his grandfather. It was silly and stupid but Salem loved it as much as he loved that goofy old man. He smiled and heard the mewls of his cats. Stella was staring at him from a high perch, the look of hunger in her eyes. Ruby just rubbed against his legs as she always did.

He put his laptop down in his work room and went to the kitchen where he got each cat their preferred bowl of food. He never skimped with his girls, it was always an actual meal worthy of a cat’s needs and desires. Each one got half a can of tuna and half a can of salmon. Stella got some fried egg bits in hers while Ruby got some slices of bananas. They were both weird cats, but they were his girls and he loved them.

“All right you two, I got work to do. Let me know if there’s trouble or mice.” Salem chuckled.

Ruby looked up and quickly bounded over to a pile of mail. Salem walked over and looked it over. Most were bills he had already paid, but one letter caught his eyes. A hand written and addressed letter from Lucretia Bloodgarden. He picked it up and briefly used it to toy with Ruby before she returned to her meal. 

“Yeah, I know it’s not even that interesting to me.” Salem nodded, “She can wait, or come here directly if it’s really important.” He put the letter on a table as he left the kitchen and walked into his computer room. 

Rather than hook the laptop up to his networked machine he opted to use an old machine from nearly sixty years ago. It was one of his older machines and still had a few games he hadn’t gotten to play on it, but it also had no network connection and was safe to work on as a result. He booted up an editing program on his old system and opened CyMaster’s program, then he began the slow and painstaking process of altering and shining up the code someone else had written. It was going to be a night of hell so he reached over and cracked open a bottle of type A cloned blood, it was his work flavor. 

It took hours of work and the sun was just about to peak over the horizon, at least according to his apps, when Sawyer crawled home with most of his clothes torn and blood that was clearly not his, splattered over him and the distinct scent of zombies on him as well. He peeked in briefly and let his friend know he was back before making it halfway to a couch and falling asleep on the spot. Salem chuckled at the sound of his body hitting the floor, Sawyer never could resist the sun’s power over him.

Salem wasn’t even tempted to ask what had happened as his attention was focused on the last remaining problem for the program before he was ready to test it online. It was constantly trying to reach out to a site on the very old and very unpleasant to use dark-net. Salem was not happy with that, CyMaster wasn’t one that would typically use such a shadowy place to hold data, he preferred his own data stores. He had to wonder if the man had accidentally switched a digit or three up; he was, after all, in a partially induced medical coma. When he finally was able to get a deeper read on it he paused and disconnected from the site immediately, he needed a better machine. He needed the Tech-Hut.

He got up and looked at his phone, it was seven in the morning, Jazz would be up. He dialed her immediately and she picked up while still clearly eating. 

“Hello Jawsome.” Jazz said playfully.

“Jazz, I need to get to the Tech-Hut ASAP. Serious business.” Salem said flatly with no jokes or sarcasm. 

“I’ll be there in forty.” Jazz said but then paused and spoke to someone else. Salem heard keys jingle before she got back on the call. “Make that twenty five, Alan’s letting me use the purple car!” 

“I’ll be ready in ten.” Salem said as he ended the call and gathered his gear. 

He looked at his laptop with deep concern. The program was one thing but the site he found on the darknet wasn’t restricted in any way, it was as if no one expected someone to come snooping around. It worried him deeply. Then he waited and rushed out to the car, and dove into the back seats and curled up in a blanket that was back there.

“What’s got you spooked?” Jazz asked as she drove off once again.

“Some seriously bad possibilities.” Salem sighed, “Do I smell coffee?” 

“Hi...” Alan’s voice came from the passenger seat. “Did you really think I’d let her take my baby all alone?” 

Salem sighed, “I honestly don’t care.” 

There was a silence before Alan spoke again. “Right, serious time. How bad?” 

“If I’m right, every hero in the U.S. is potentially in danger.” Salem grumbled.

Alan was immediately on his phone and quickly cursed. “Paradox is still zonked.” 

“How does that thing need sleep?” Salem asked in shock. 

“Everyone needs to recharge some time, pretty one.” Jaz said with an audible smile.

“You two flirting is a sin.” Alan snickered. 

“This isn’t flirting.” Salem wanted, “These are pet names.” He could only imagine Jazz’s enthusiastic nodding. 

“That’s a big yike from me.” Alan chuckled, “We’ll get you there, no worries.” 

“We have a twenty minute dr-” Salem felt Alan grab his legs and knew in an instant what was about to happen as the man let rip with a maniacal laugh. 

The next thing Salem knew he was landing on the wooden floor of the Tech-Hut. Alan was toppled over a chair, covered in coffee and using a trash can to vomit in.  Salem was unaffected by the spatial distortion’s effect on the balance centers of his body, but he was still wobbly when he stood thanks to the speed at which he hit the floor. 

“Okay, you done showing off?” Salem asked.

Alan stood up and held the trashcan close by, but nodded.

“Good, let me get to work.” Salem sat on his chair and began to type. 

His work was slow and planned carefully. He had to disguise every action he took as he started to bring a modern super system into the dark-net. When he was finally there he put up a display to simplify the data stores that he and Alan were looking at. The data stores were exact copies from the Charter Organization’s mainframe for the last six months and they included hero identity information. Both men stared in shock at the information before them.

“Salem, I’m not a smart man by any measure but...” Alan paused and confirmed what he was seeing, “This means what I think it means, right?” 

“Yeah.” Salem grunted, “And it gets worse.” Salem began typing, “CyMaster’s coding led me here.” 

“We’re gonna nuke it right?” Alan asked.

Salem was about to nod, “It’s a risk. This definitely isn’t in Blackwood’s game. He may take drastic measures if we nuke it. Could hurt Greg.” 

Alan frowned. “I’ll leave it to your expertise then.” 

Salem was frozen for a moment, but very thankful that he had been as he noticed a system scan passed over his connection and missed it. Then he watched more data pour in, including information on the program CyMaster had written. Then it was as if data began sorting itself. It took him a few moments longer to realize that he was watching an A.I.at work. He quietly disconnected as soon as the A.I.’s connection vanished.

“So playing it close, I get it.” Alan nodded.

“Quain, we need to talk to Trident. Now.” Salem stood up. “No delays.” 

Alan sighed and stood up next to him. “This is the last I got in me for a day or two, you sure?” 

Salem nodded.

Salem felt his body lurch and light and sound inverted for a moment before he came rolling across a floor. Then felt fire on his side as sunlight hit him. It was promptly extinguished and the sunlight blocked just as fast. 

“Gods alive!” Trident shouted, “You two couldn’t have given a heads up?! I would have closed my curtains.”

“Didn’t think about it.” Salem admitted with a grunt as he stood. Alan was vomiting into a nearby trashcan once again. “We need to have a serious threat to the country level talk.” 

Trident’s face didn’t soften, but he switched gears from anger to business. “What’s wrong?”

“Give him a minute.” Salem nodded to Alan.

“I’m good. Just as long as we don’t need to do that again.” Alan gasped, “It keeps getting less fun each time.” 

“I can only imagine why.” Salem shook his head, “Make this place soundproof, yeah?” 

Alan nodded and focused, the walls glowed purple and became opaque at the windows.  “We’re good.” 

“What is the issue?” Trident looked at Alan over Salem.

Alan gestured to Salem. “Ask the expert.”

“Alan, I’m asking you, you’re supposed to be the leader here! Believe me I know I’m not the one to talk with all the bull I’ve missed and let go under my nose, but you need to be up to speed! We’re leaders here.” Trident snapped. 

“He’s my head of security and technology. He is a leader in BSC.” Alan countered.

Trident looked at Salem and nodded, “What’s the situation?” 

“CyMaster is compromised. Probably digital in origin, A.I. seems to be connected and we both know he’s got vulnerabilities to stuff like that.” Salem said flatly.

Trident groaned and sat in a chair. “I don’t need this. The entire Organization is falling apart, it has been since I got there. We lost guards when I joined and even if we got one back, now we’re losing heroes.”   

Trident’s state of mind was obvious and Salem was having none of it. He stood to his full height, no longer stooping over to make others comfortable, and marched over to Trident. He reached down and lifted the demi-god up by his shoulders, then slammed him into the nearest wall.

“Well you don’t have a choice, do you? You’re the leader here, right? You think you’re the only one looking at how fucked this situation is and wiondering how we’re gonna dig our way out? We all are, that’s the curse of your leadership. People look to you when hope is gone and you gotta act like you have the answers. I had to act like that on my walk of shame out of the Org and I’ll be damned if I let that fucked up tradition continue.” Salem let Trident go, “We don’t have all the answers, but we have some and we need your help to work with what we have. We need to be smart about this because your smart guy is under GLOBAL’s thumb.” 

Trident sighed and nodded, “I know, I’m just so tired of seeing good men and women...” He gestured about pointing to the windows. 

“I know, that’s the thing about guys like us, we got limited leadership shelf lives.” Salem sighed, “But we do mentorships very well and for a long time.” 

“This is going to destroy the Charter Organization, possibly the Charter document in the U.S.” Trident sighed, “He has access to so much information.” 

“And now GLOBAL does.” Alan added, “We need to take him down without them knowing. Preferably without him knowing.” 

Trident nodded, “Once this is over, the Organization will be shut down, can you take those the Union can’t or won’t?” 

“We’re the Black Sheep Company, baby, we take all munchkins and shenaniganry.” Alan grinned.

“I have no idea what he just said.” Trident sighed.

“Yes.” Salem translated with his own sigh.

“And you claim to be men of culture.” Alan scoffed. 

“Alan...” Trident sighed, “You really are a doofus.” He laughed deeply and nodded, “Then once the investigations are over, I’m going to D.C. and I’m gonna get answers and a proper understanding of The Charter. I won’t let it stay dead.” 

“Good.” Salem grinned, “I didn’t sign it for nothing.” 

Alan smiled, “Time comes, I'll walk with you. But let's work on the current issues, yeah?”

Trident nodded and stood to stretch.  

Salem smiled as the two leaders came to a deeper understanding than they had ever done before. He stretched and yawned, stooping over once more, hiding his full intimidating height.

One time, he whispered something to the cashier and the cashier looked at him awkwardly and little uncomfortably. Then he said hey, he’s buying your drink today. And I was surprised so I was a bit awkward too and said oh wow! Tell him thank you! It was a bit awkward interactions since that day. I didn’t know whether to thank him personally or just pretend it didn’t happen and go on as usual. Also, I wasn’t sure if he was hitting on me or if he was just being nice.

1g34x1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadwood/comments/1g34x1f/there_are_so_many_amazing_stories_from_the_real/,"There are so many amazing stories from the real Deadwood, having just re-watched it I'm sad they relied so much on stereotypes.","I've always been a big fan of Deadwood, and having rewatched it all recently I got wondering about what the real community was like and I've been left with the feeling that they really did some characters (and their communities) dirty, especially the people of colour!

Rather than go on at length about the limitations of Deadwood (as many people have written well on this) I thought I'd just share some random snippets of things I read about from two great articles that changed my perception. I hope you enjoy imagining the lives these real people as much as I did.

One of the first I read was ""**Ethnic Oasis: Chinese Immigrants in the Frontier Black Hills"" by Liping Zhu (2003)**. Accessed here: [https://www.sdhspress.com/journal/south-dakota-history-33-4/ethnic-oasis-chinese-immigrants-in-the-frontier-black-hills/vol-33-no-4-ethnic-oasis.pdf](https://www.sdhspress.com/journal/south-dakota-history-33-4/ethnic-oasis-chinese-immigrants-in-the-frontier-black-hills/vol-33-no-4-ethnic-oasis.pdf) This article really taught me so much, there is such a wealth of information about Chinese communities in the black hills and Deadwood in particular. What struck me was that these communities were extremely organised and far less segregated than was implied by the TV show. This article is full of beautiful photos and surprising statistics and stories. They all show that Wu (while loveable) was not a fair representation of a community that was so well organised and engaged with its neighbours. But not only that, I find it even stranger that they show so few characters having any contact with Wu or other Chinese characters. I'm going to paste some quotes here as examples of things that I think David Milch should be a bit ashamed for missing (this article having been printed before Deadwood was aired).

""Most of the Chinese eating houses bore American names such as ""Sacramento Restaurant,"" ""Philadelphia Café,"" ""Lincoln Restaurant,"" ""Bodega Café,"" ""Elegant Restaurant,"" ""OK Café,"" ""Club Restaurant,"" ""Empire Café,"" ""Drakes Chinese Noodle,"" and ""Paris Café."" Some operated as if they were part of a white-owned establishment; for example, **Sam Wols Chiung's Restaurant was located on the first floor of the Bullock Hotel in Deadwood.** Except for a few exotic items like rice wine and chicken rice soup on the menu, the Chinese-owned restaurants mainly served familiar western dishes, including roast beef, T-bone steak, rabbit stew, French bread, and apple pie. Each meal usually cost only twenty-five cents, with a five-dollar discount plan that covered twenty-one meals.""

""**Perhaps the most powerful guardian of Chinese interests was Deadwood's mayor, Sol Star. As early as 1877, some Chinese residents became acquainted with Star, who was then a prospector and city council member, and asked him to help facilitate some mining transactions for small service fees.** The relationship between Star and the Chinese gradually deepened. In the next three decades, Star was, if not a business partner, an outspoken advocate of the Chinese in Deadwood. In addition to selling and buying properties from each other, Star and certain members of the Chinese business community worked together on projects that ranged from investing in mining claims to taking out bank loans. Around the time the city was incorporated. Star became mayor of Deadwood, a post he held for twenty two years. Starting in the early 1890s, he was elected clerk of the Lawrence County Court and served well into the new century. During his tenure as mayor and court clerk. Star did his best to protect the Chinese from injustice and violence. Meanwhile, the Chinese community looked upon him as its mentor, often going to him for advice and information. For example, the continuous shooting of firecrackers beginning at sundown on the eve of the Chinese New Year annoyed most of the local residents, who wanted to ban such practice. Instead of prohibiting firecrackers altogether, Mayor Star persuaded white residents to make a compromise, confining firecracker discharges to the hours between 2.00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M. on New Year's Day. Starting in 1892, Deadwood assigned a police officer to Chinatown during its holidays ""to prevent malicious mischief and interruptions by ruffians"" and give the Chinese greater security for their celebrations.4\* One white pioneer later recalled that **Mayor Star ""worked for the best interests of both races and it is probably due to this fact that both Chinese and white people were able to live so harmoniously in the days of stress and strife.""**

""Chinese placer mining activities increased, however, after they began reworking the old claims abandoned by whites.Superb skills in water management gave Chinese prospectors an edge over others in extracting scarce gold. One reporter wrote, ""The Chinese who have been sluicing all winter in the Cape Horn district, have been taking out at the rate of $4 to the heathen, while the white miners were unable to make the water run.""'° Some Chinese were making more than just minimum wages. In 1877, a group of Chinese bought a claim on Whitewood Creek for twelve hundred dollars. A year later, they purchased another claim for thirty-five hundred dollars in cash. The Black Hills Daily Times enviously commented, ""From this it is evident that they have struck something, and that there is gold in that district after all."""" One Chinese miner was reported to have found ""a nugget on his claim that weighed over four hundred dollars.""'\^ These sensational reports generated jealousy among other,less fortunate miners."" \[I included this because I feel like Deadwood didn't acknowledge the pre-occupation of White minors about Chinese gold mining, or that there were Chinese owned claims at all, let alone had expertise in placer mining.\]

The next I read was **""Lucretia Marchbanks: A Black Woman in the Black Hills"" by Todd Guenther (2001)**. (accessed here: [https://www.sdhspress.com/journal/south-dakota-history-31-1/lucretia-marchbanks-a-black-woman-in-the-black-hills/vol-31-no-1-lucretia-marchbanks.pdf](https://www.sdhspress.com/journal/south-dakota-history-31-1/lucretia-marchbanks-a-black-woman-in-the-black-hills/vol-31-no-1-lucretia-marchbanks.pdf) This one really got to me! I am baffled that they knew enough about Lucretia Marchbanks to include her as Aunt Lou, but then chose to include nothing about her beyond her superlative cooking? She went to the Black Hills independently after gaining her freedom during the Civil War, nothing to do with Hearst or anything remotely as passive as being 'sent for' by a rich white man.

""Marchbanks was after gold, too, But had no intention of becoming a miner herself, That was man's work. While a few women tried their hands at prospecting, most worked in support or service industries, supplying the wants and needs of miners in exchange for some of their gold. Providing meals for the prospectors whose time was devoted almost exclusively to toiling through rock and mud after an elusive bonanza was one important source of in-come, **Marchbanks promptly secured employment as a cook in Carl Wagner's Grand Central Hotel,** a two-story frame building with offices, saloon, dining room, and kitchen on the first floor and a parlor and sleeping rooms upstairs. Cooking was a job that allowed Marchbanks to support herself and still maintain her feminine respectability.""

"" A little over two months after her arrival, a situation arose that would have terrified a less intrepid individual than Marchbanks. In August 1876, a Mexican man cut off the head of an Indian who had been killed by a third man and paraded the gruesome trophy around town. His riotous debauch eventually took him to the Grand Central where he ""boasted that he had killed an Indian and perhaps let it be known that he wasn't above adding another notch to his gun."" As the nervous customers sipped their coffee and kept a watchful eye on the strutting killer, ""**Aunt Lou decided he wasn't exactly an attraction to the establishment and confronted him with a gleaming knife in hand and fire in her eye.**"" Noting her keen blade, the man ""decided he had urgent business elsewhere.""\^\^ In an era when women were expected to be quiet, submissive and retiring, Lucretia Marchbanks gained a reputation for being unintimidated by male bravado or death"" \[This one is wild!!! Deadwood includes this event but erases Lucretia Marchbanks' role! The article makes the point that this might be apocryphal, but that never stopped Milch anywhere else...\]

Here she is in a dress given to her by a grateful diner:

""Lucretia Marchbanks personally played a role in the process of settling and developing the American West. Moreover, **the single, female,non-white cook, hotel owner, and rancher was not content to be a mere shadow. Instead, she worked diligently to live her own life on her own terms, to the greatest extent possible.** The reputation she established and the property she acquired under difficult frontier circumstances were nothing short of remarkable for a woman who had started out her life as someone else's property. Altogether, she gained the respect and even love of those who knew her—black and white—and was able to live a modestly comfort-able life in spite of the complex world of frontier race relations.""

If you have read this far (<3) or skipped to the end, what are some stories from Deadwood's non-white communities that you think could have made the show better?  
Imagine if instead of Richardson we had had a depiction of Lucretria Marchbanks that fit her formidable reputation as the independent freed slave who became cook at the Grand Central?  
Or if instead of only seeing Wu and Al barking words at each other we saw Chinese characters organise with members of the burgeoning settlement, working within and without the political and legal systems as much as any other characters?",0,1728869023.0,deadwood,12,0.25,False

(Follow up to a previous post where I felt terrible) ,"Coming here to say it took about 6 weeks and I on multiple occasions have said “wow these withdrawal symptoms make me feel like a total crackhead & I can feel my heartbeat in my head”. Coffee still makes me wanna puke and I get car sick and occasional tinnitus at night and my mood swings (mostly lack of patience and crying) are still kinda wild BUT for the first time today I’m like “wow I feel normal and am rawdogging life rn”.

Firstly, I want to say Effexor saved my life and changed it for the better. I was on it for 3 years between 75mg and 150mg and it allowed me to be in a place where I could successfully work on myself with my brain working properly. 

So for those of you who are coming on here who may get scared by all of us complaining - if it works for you, it works and don’t let us communally commiserating scare you off. Mental health is so important and this medication saves lives. 

Alight back to my taper: I went from 150 > 75 > 35 > approx 1/2 of that based on my weighting the beads in a very non precise manner. I am on vyvanse as well and didn’t do the Prozac bridge but WISH I did. 

I quit because of 2 reasons:
1. My night sweats were so bad and consistent (I am talking smelly, soak everything, my husband got a different blanket, ruin the mattress sweaty) for a year. I just couldn’t do it. 
2. I am considering trying to have a kid and my doc said there wasn’t a lot of studies on the medication and pregnancy so we should consider switching to one that has more studies (but it was probably fine). I just didn’t want to go through the process of trying something new and I was already considering getting off it anyway. 

What I did to help - it’s chaotic and I’m not a doc :
- microdose Benadryl: I’d bite off a 3rd of a Benadryl every few hours. Helped a LOT with the brain zaps 
- Pepcid : I read somewhere it’s good for pmdd, and the symptoms for me were very similar (I have pmdd) so this also helped nausea
- cbd/thc: I live in Canada so the 2mg edibles at night put me to sleep and calmed the INSANE dreams. Like I get nightmares but these were like extremely vivid very mundane dreams that I would wake up and be like “wtf did I buy that scarf?”
- sparkling water: keeps me hydrated and settles the stomach (PC brand ginger water is goat for this) 
- walking: gentle movement got my mind off it
- wearing my glasses: unless I’m driving at night I can get away without them, wearing them in the day helped. 
- honesty: just telling people what was going on was so helpful bc I’d just be like “I’m going through pretty heavy withdrawal symptoms rn, 3 year olds have better emotional regulation than me”

So there’s a light at the end of the quitting tunnel, id say after 4 weeks I got back to my regular routine and 6 weeks I actually feel ok.

------------------------------------------------------------

Tuscany house plans designs capture the essence of the beautiful Italian countryside, characterized by their rustic charm and timeless elegance. If you dream of a home that embodies warmth and sophistication, exploring these designs can inspire your vision. Whether you wish to build a cozy retreat or a grand estate, Tuscany-style homes are sure to impress.

One of the key features in Tuscany house plans is the use of natural materials. The abundant use of stone, brick, and wood in construction ensures that your home not only looks authentic but also blends seamlessly with the surrounding landscape. Imagine walking into a living space adorned with exposed wooden beams and terracotta tiles underfoot. This natural aesthetic invites warmth and coziness into your home.

The floor plans of Tuscany homes often prioritize open spaces. You will notice that the kitchen, dining, and living areas flow together, creating an inviting atmosphere ideal for family gatherings and entertaining guests. This open concept design enhances interaction and ensures that no one feels isolated during get-togethers. You might want to consider the following elements when selecting your open floor plan:

- Large kitchen islands that serve as gathering spots.
- Wide doorways to promote seamless transitions between spaces.
- Informal dining areas that encourage casual meals.

In Tuscany house plans designs, you will also find a focus on outdoor living. The stunning landscape of Tuscany often inspires designers to create spaces that connect indoor and outdoor areas effortlessly. Imagine a spacious patio or terrace where you can enjoy your morning coffee while taking in breathtaking views. Here are a few features to consider for outdoor areas:

- Arched doorways that open onto patios.
- Outdoor kitchens for alfresco dining.
- Rustic wooden pergolas providing shade for outdoor seating.

Color is another distinguishing trait of Tuscany house plans. Earthy tones such as terracotta, muted greens, and warm yellows paint a picture of the natural environment. These colors not only provide a beautiful aesthetic but also evoke a sense of tranquility and comfort. When selecting colors for your home, consider using a palette that reflects the serene beauty of Tuscany.

Windows play a crucial role in capturing the Tuscan vibe. Typically, you will find large, beautifully framed windows that allow for ample light, creating an airy atmosphere. The inclusion of wrought iron details and shutters enhances the charm of your home and pays homage to traditional Italian architecture. You might want to explore:

- Round or arched window designs for a softer look.
- Shuttered windows that add character and functionality.
- Floor-to-ceiling windows that provide stunning views.

Another important feature to consider is the use of fireplaces. A focal point in many Tuscany homes, the fireplace serves both functional and aesthetic purposes. The warmth and ambiance a fireplace provides is perfect for cozy family evenings. Typical Tuscany designs incorporate:

- Stone or brick fireplaces offering rustic appeal.
- Large mantles that serve as decorative showcases.
- Ventless options for spaces where traditional chimneys may not fit.

When looking through Tuscany house plans designs, it’s essential to consider sustainability. Many modern interpretations of traditional Tuscan designs include eco-friendly features. These can range from energy-efficient appliances to rainwater harvesting systems. Emphasizing green living helps your home not only look good but also support the environment. Think about integrating:

- Solar panels hidden from view on the roof.
- High-efficiency windows that minimize heating and cooling needs.
- Natural insulation materials, like straw bale, for eco-friendly comfort.

Tuscany house plans designs offer a harmonious blend of rustic beauty and modern comfort. By focusing on natural materials, open spaces, beautiful outdoor areas, and more, these plans provide an inspiring foundation for your dream home. Whether you are in the early stages of planning or looking for inspiration, consider these elements to create a space that truly embodies the charm of the Tuscan landscape.

Sustainable Elements in Modern Tuscany Architecture
---------------------------------------------------

Modern Tuscany architecture seamlessly blends traditional aesthetics with innovative sustainable practices. This design philosophy embraces the historic charm of Tuscany while prioritizing environmental consciousness. If you're considering building or renovating a home in this picturesque region, understanding the sustainable elements in modern architecture can inspire creative choices for your project.

### Integration with Nature

One of the foremost sustainable elements in contemporary Tuscany designs is the integration of natural surroundings. Hills, olive groves, and vineyards are not just scenery; they become integral to the design of the home. Large windows and open spaces invite natural light and fresh air, reducing the need for artificial light and climate control.

### Use of Local Materials

Embracing local materials is both a sustainable practice and a nod to Tuscany's rich heritage. Here are a few materials commonly used:

- **Terracotta:** This traditional material offers excellent insulation and complements the warm color palette of Tuscan landscapes.
- **Wood:** Sustainably sourced timber, often used in beams and flooring, adds warmth and character to the home.
- **Stone:** Utilizing local stone provides durability and blends the home with its environment, creating a timeless aesthetic.

### Energy-Efficient Design

Modern Tuscany homes often incorporate energy-efficient design elements that cut down on energy use. Key features include:

- **Passive Solar Design:** Homes are oriented to maximize sunlight, reducing heating costs and improving comfort.
- **High-Quality Insulation:** Investing in superior insulation keeps homes cool in summer and warm in winter, enhancing energy efficiency.
- **Energy-Efficient Windows:** Double or triple-glazed windows minimize heat loss while allowing for natural light, creating a cozy atmosphere.

### Water Conservation

Water conservation is a vital aspect of sustainable living. Innovative modern Tuscany homes implement techniques to reduce water usage:

- **Rainwater Harvesting:** Collecting rainwater for irrigation and household use diminishes reliance on municipal water systems.
- **Low-Flow Fixtures:** Installing low-flow faucets and toilets helps conserve water without sacrificing performance.
- **Permeable Paving:** Using permeable materials in driveways and patios allows rainwater to seep into the ground, reducing runoff and erosion.

### Renewable Energy Sources

As the world moves towards greener solutions, integrating renewable energy sources into construction has become more prevalent:

- **Solar Panels:** These are becoming a common sight on Tuscany rooftops, generating clean energy and decreasing energy bills.
- **Wind Turbines:** Depending on the location, small-scale wind turbines can provide an additional source of renewable energy.
- **Geothermal Heating:** Harnessing the Earth’s natural temperature can efficiently heat and cool homes, leading to significant energy savings.

### Smart Home Technology

Smart technology into modern Tuscany homes enhances sustainability:

- **Smart Thermostats:** These devices help manage energy consumption by learning your heating and cooling habits.
- **Automated Lighting:** Using motion sensors and timers reduces energy waste by ensuring lights are off when rooms are vacant.
- **Water Leak Sensors:** These devices can detect leaks early, preventing excess water waste and potential damage.

Building a home in Tuscany provides a unique opportunity to harness the beauty of the landscape while integrating sustainable practices. By choosing local materials, energy-efficient designs, and renewable technologies, you not only honor the region's rich architectural history but also contribute to a healthier planet. Embracing these sustainable elements will ensure your modern Tuscany home embodies comfort, elegance, and environmental responsibility. As you plan your dream house, consider how these features can elevate both your living experience and the surrounding ecosystem.

### Conclusion

As you venture into the world of Tuscany house plans designs, it's clear that these homes offer a blend of timeless charm and modern functionality. The unique features of Tuscany architecture showcase rich textures, warm colors, and inviting layouts, all designed to enhance your living experience. Whether it’s the arched doorways or terracotta tiles, each element reflects a deep connection to nature and the surrounding landscape, making you feel right at home in the serene Italian countryside.

Moreover, contemporary Tuscany designs incorporate sustainable elements that not only respect the environment but also promote energy efficiency. Builders and designers are increasingly focusing on renewable resources, solar energy, and innovative insulation materials. This commitment to sustainability allows you to enjoy the aesthetic beauty of Tuscany living while minimizing your ecological footprint.

The combination of traditional aesthetics and modern sustainable practices makes Tuscany house plans highly appealing. These designs are not just about visual appeal; they resonate with a lifestyle that values both beauty and responsibility. As you contemplate your dream home, consider how incorporating these unique features and sustainable elements can enhance your quality of life.

By choosing a Tuscany house plan, you’re opting for a harmonious blend of history, culture, and nature. This journey not only enriches your living space but also nurtures your connection to the earth. So, let the allure of Tuscany guide you in crafting a home that truly embodies elegance and sustainability.

This is the very, very early impressions of this headphone. I will say it is similar to the AR5000, which I love. It might be slightly less bright, and a little harder to drive. The case is very premium and nice, and it comes with a 3.5mm cable and the 4.4mm cable. The sound isolation seems pretty good. I couldn’t hear much around me while listening to music, and I think it isolated fairly well for people hearing what I’m listening to around me. The pads are MUCH better than the AR5000, even though I think those are already very comfortable. 

There is a $300 price difference here. Initial impressions, is it worth $300 more? My initial impression is no, but I also think the use case for the sound isolation makes this a candidate where the AR5000 isn’t. I would go for these if you frequent coffee shops, an office, or fly a lot and want some closed back headphones without active noise cancellation.

We often see self-care as activities like baths, reading, or exercise, but what about the subtle movements or repetitive actions that calm our nervous system? Stimming deserves a spot in your self-care toolkit.

You can create “stim breaks” throughout the day, just like a coffee break. Five minutes to bounce on your toes, run your fingers over textures, or do whatever movement grounds you. Think of it as giving your brain the reset it craves.

Need something more structured? Pair stimming with existing routines. While brushing your teeth, try swaying. During work breaks, finger tapping. These small actions give you control over your sensory world, making stimming as essential to your day as any other form of care.

Let’s stop thinking of stimming as an involuntary reaction and start thinking of it as an intentional act of self-kindness.

Do I need a $3000 machine, $500 grinder, $50-100 each for a tamp/needle thing, a puck screen, multiple different types of buckets, are there breakpoints in quality to setups based on price (ex. $500 tier, $1000 tier, etc)? What's the minimum you would consider spending to substitute going to a nice local cafe and paying $7+ per coffee, without being less satisfied with what you're drinking? I'm not super sensitive about price, but am not looking for anything too crazy.

And does any of this matter to someone who drinks maybe 3-4 per week, preferring americanos and cortados?",1,1728868262.0,espresso,5,0.67,False

Prologue

The coffee cooled between her fingers as Marina's eyes roamed the computer screen, absorbing every detail of Gustavo's life. His schedules, his preferences, even the way he moved in his chair while programming. Everything was there, recorded in her notebooks, in her mind, on the countless nights she spent analyzing his every post, every comment and every routine. He was perfect. The discreet, introspective programmer, with a singular charm, the kind of man who had no idea he was being watched.

Months have passed since she first caught a glimpse of him in an online technology group. He was just one face among many, until, for some reason, she couldn't stop thinking about him. Gustavo quickly went from being a passing curiosity to becoming his obsession.

She approached him slowly, infiltrating circles of mutual friends, following him on social media and learning everything about him. Nothing escaped his radar. What he ate, when he went for a run, even the emails he exchanged with co-workers. Marina didn't feel guilty. In his mind, it was love. A love he didn't know he wanted. Yet.

His plan was simple, carefully thought out. Every calculated movement, every planned coincidence. They would ""bump into"" the coffee shop he always went to, she would say the right words, and he would, of course, fall in love with her. After all, she was the perfect girl for him. I knew exactly how to earn your trust, how to be indispensable. What could go wrong?

But, as the days approached and her plan prepared to be put into practice, something began to bother her. It was all too easy. He seemed to be exactly where she wanted him to be, always at the right time, as if he too was following a script. As if he was... waiting for her.

Marina shook her head, pushing the thought away. ""Impossible,"" she whispered to herself. But something about the way Gustavo looked at the cameras, the way he sometimes smiled at the screen, gave her an unsettling feeling, as if, after all, she wasn't the hunter.

And yes, the prey.

So I've been looking at the Oracle Jet and it looks like an amazing machine. However, I'm a little scared I won't like it as much as my Express because of the loss of ""control"" on the whole puck prep. I'm used to measuring everything, keeping a super tight consistancy.

I work for this fucking boring ass company. All day long I'm Yessir and OF course Sir to these spoiled babies, they have no backbones, you know, the car, the suit the colloquial banter. They have money but no power, they as poor as they are rich. I'm smiling as I'm bringing coffee but I'm wet as hell when I'm bringing them to task.

I've done good for myself, I got what I need, I made what I have...and I can have what I want ...yet I find myself surrounded by these Bond boys. You know how scrimpy and spendy they are lol the amt of coke on their fucking pink faces.

I want to wring them, yet I am seriously attracted to their slim frames slight muscle and silly comeons, something about a pale ass executive in a white shirt just gets me.  As a golden skinned beach goddess I had to fight them off when I started, they never met someone like me and that was fun, Flipping my dark long ponytail in their faces, using my warm voice to turn them on, when they press 0 to find some fucking file. 

That was fun for a bit. I got a kick out of being clueless, virginal, sultry, soft. In my mind I am giving them the slow pegging of their life. 

That's what I'm thinking laughing at their jokes, showing guests to their desks. 

I have disdain for you, stock boys, trading pokemon cards and praying for moass lol

The loss of discipline I see with every little flutter of RC tweet, I'm rolling my eyes because y'all have no SUBSTANCE. What the fuck is the point of making the money and just rolling in it like a pig. 

As I'm sitting at reception swiping on lipgloss writing  treatise thinking of how one day soon I want to lock these boys in. I want to line them all up with no bottoms on and measure the thickness of their wallets and the height of the their good deeds.

Bitch how many trees have you planted. How many billionaire's multigallons of oil are you funding with that cash. That's nasty. What you doing with your life.

Done good? Funding diversity? Donating to NFP? Get my hand on your cheek and my sweet wet kitty just touching the tip of your finger, take that home to sniff.

Done better than that? I'm gonna bend you over and make love to your bussy like only a hot, curvy as fuck dominating caribbean queen can do, see these glutes? They were made for reaming you lol

Done bad, done shit all? Wasting your cash on samurai swords and cam girls, you get nathing, NA THING lol your poor striken willy hanging like a green papaya while I reward your broskis
 
Damn, this is so fun. So yeah, what you doing with your cash? Drying up the amazon? Clearcutting rainforest with your fucking ETFs

I want to you to pull your head out of your ass and BE BETTER, 

Save the fucking world motherfuckers.

Let me be your dominatrix, your sizzling saintly top.

I'm planting native species and pollinator gardens with your bills, come on,

Quaint mom-and-pop establishment. I was a third-shift manager, I prided myself on keeping the peace- at least that was what I told myself. That was until the fateful Valentine's Weekend of 1979

At the small hotel sat nestled on the outskirts of town, it was a slow night, save for the occasional couple checking in for a romp. The overhead lights were humming in my ears and the heater was clanking away in the lobby. The clock ticked like it was going backwards. There had been an Aerosmith concert earlier in the night, so there was some light action from that but nothing else.

The door swung open, and in walked a man in bellbottoms, suave and smooth-talking, a charming grin painted over his face. He checked in with a whimsical story about a Valentine surprise for his girlfriend. The way he spoke, with fervor and a hint of mania, left me unsettled. He pivoted almost immediately into a bizarre religious spiel about honoring your partner—but there was something laced with something dark and deviant. I forced a smile and handed him the key to Room 12, trying to shake the chill creeping down my spine.

A few hours later, I heard the back door creak open. felt the hairs on my arms stand on end. For a fleeting moment, I dismissed it as the wind, but then came the whimpering—a sound completely out of place in the small hotel. A puppy, I thought. It was well-known that the establishment was a pet-free zone, but I allowed myself a fleeting moment of false hope, convincing myself that maybe another guest had made an exception.

Moments later, a thud echoed down the hall, followed by whimpering that spun into desperate cries. I knocked on the door to Room 12 but was met by silence. Sensing something terribly amiss, I knocked again. The door swung open with the knock, revealing the thin man in bellbottoms, now veiled in the shadows of the door, standing sinister over something bloody.

Before I could react, a figure bolted from the room. It was his girlfriend, her appearance like something from a nightmare—bloody, screaming, and trembling. She flung herself behind me as if I were a shield against the monster she had just escaped. The man snarled, eyes burning with madness as he slammed the door and barricaded it shut.

“What happened?” I asked, desperation creeping into my voice. The woman clutched my arm, her sobs spilling over like a broken dam.

“He... he got me,” she gasped grabbing her gut, her voice cracking. “Please, you have to help me!”

I turned to use the lobby phone on in the back lobby, it was the only phone we had back then. I dialed emergency service for her but when I turned back around to describe her injuries to them -- she was gone. Moments later, police arrived. They coaxed the man out with calm authority, and as he stepped through the doorway, my pulse quickened. His eyes scanned the room and locked onto mine, an instant recognition flashing between us.

The ensuing chaos blurred into a haze of red and blue lights, I stood from a distance while they discussed that the girl had disappeared. The bell-bottomed man claimed she was on acid and ran out of the room in a screaming fit. There was no knife in the room, no blood, no weapon. Hours later, I found myself being questioned about why I had gone in Room 12 with a man I didn't know and was I okay?

I explained to them that it wasn't me. Another woman had run from the room but she had disappeared when I turned my back, running off into the fog. There were no video cameras back then so I had nothing to show them who went in the room. The police released the strange man and he was suddenly gone to me. The police were gone too.

Everyone left.

And I was alone in the aftermath, the eerie silence settled over the hotel like a thick fog and my mind felt feverish. I locked up the lobby and fetched cleaning supplies and headed to Room 12, my hands trembling on the doorknob.

Inside, the aftermath of violence painted the walls—splatters of blood, remnants of a horror that had unspooled just hours prior. I scrubbed feverishly, each stroke dragging me deeper into a pit of despair as memories replayed like a horrifying film reel looping in my mind. The girl’s cries echoed, and I wondered how I could have let this happen under my watch.

As I scrubbed, time distorted; minutes stretched into hours. The weight of the night pressed down like the oppressive air before a storm. I was trapped in a moment I couldn’t escape, and the feeling gnawed at me, a visceral dread that something unseen was still lurking in that desolate hotel.

Then I suddenly collapsed on the bed, realizing I was tripping on lsd. The thin man in the bell-bottom had passed me acid on the candy. I curled up in a ball wondering why he would do that. I did long breathing in and out. I was glad I had signed up for that yoga class at the local YMCA.

Part of me thought maybe none of it was real. I started to look up schizophrenia, thinking maybe that could explain what happened.

But days turned into weeks and the incident slipped into whispers within the town. The rumors were that the woman admitted she was on acid with a strange man to the police and had flown out of the room thinking an octopus monster was after her.

I actually ran into the man months later at the grocery store in the town next to the hotel. He stood casually, with a devil-may-care look on his face. Our eyes met, and that recognition struck again, but this time, his expression felt something far more sinister—a predatory gleam.

I hurried past him, my heart pounding all the way into my ears, the supermarket becoming a dizzying blur of smells and sounds. But then it hit me, he had dosed me that night at the hotel.

I marched back to ask him. I came up so close I could see the green on his cowboy boots sticking out of his faded denim bell-bottoms. I looked up at him, ""did they ever find your special Valentine friend?""

But he changed the subject, ""did you like the peppermint? I made it myself for my special Valentine friend.""

And with that, I had my answers so I smiled at him. The puzzle was solved. I wasn't going crazy. And I realized exactly what had happened the night of Room 12. It had been hard to discern if I was going insane. I breathed a sigh of relief. I knew now

I realized I was the girl he had in Room 12. It was me that came running out. I had realized I was, but it really made no sense. Everyone in town had described her as looking exactly like me, wearing the exact outfit I was wearing.

The next morning after my cinnamon rolls and coffee, I went to the sheriff's office to find out all I could about that night, to make a report that I think I was actually the woman that ran from the room because the man had possibly drugged me.

No sooner did I tell them that they made several phone calls to that man's home. There was no answer. They called his employer but the employer said there was no man by that name.

Police said there was nothing in the system for the name he had given. Nobody had any IDs on them so the whole situation was just marked down as a drug incident.

So I asked my very last question, ""Can you please tell me what name he gave you? I think he tried to sexually harrass me.""

Sexually harrassment wasn't a big deal back then like it is now, so Im not sure they really cared. But I gave them my best puppy dog eyes.

The rounder faced officer stood up, ""He said his name was Jack Straw from WItchita.""

I left, knowing that was just a lyrics to a song I know. He'd told them song lyrics and they believed him. I spent years hoping to bump into him again. I was going to give him citizen's arrest, or maybe teach him a lesson. I wasn't sure. But fate never helped me.

She flung herself behind me as if I were a shield against the monster she had just escaped. The man snarled, eyes burning with madness as he slammed the door and barricaded it shut.

“What happened?” I asked, desperation creeping into my voice. The woman clutched my arm, her sobs spilling over like a broken dam.

“He... he got me,” she gasped grabbing her gut, her voice cracking. “Please, you have to help me!”

I turned to use the lobby phone on in the back lobby, it was the only phone we had back then. I dialed emergency service for her but when I turned back around to describe her injuries to them -- she was gone.  Moments later, police arrived. They coaxed the man out with calm authority, and as he stepped through the doorway, my pulse quickened. His eyes scanned the room and locked onto mine, an instant recognition flashing between us.

The ensuing chaos blurred into a haze of red and blue lights, I stood from a distance while they discussed that the girl had disappeared.  The bell-bottomed man claimed she was on acid and ran out of the room in a screaming fit.  There was no knife in the room, no blood, no weapon.  Hours later, I found myself being questioned about why I had gone in Room 12 with a man I didn't know and was I okay?  

I explained to them that it wasn't me.  Another woman had run from the room but she had disappeared when I turned my back, running off into the fog. There were no video cameras back then so I had nothing to show them who went in the room.  The police released the strange man and he was suddenly gone to me.  The police were gone too.  

Everyone left.

And I was alone in the aftermath, the eerie silence settled over the hotel like a thick fog and my mind felt feverish. I locked up the lobby and fetched cleaning supplies and headed to Room 12, my hands trembling on the doorknob.

Inside, the aftermath of violence painted the walls—splatters of blood, remnants of a horror that had unspooled just hours prior. I scrubbed feverishly, each stroke dragging me deeper into a pit of despair as memories replayed like a horrifying film reel looping in my mind. The girl’s cries echoed, and I wondered how I could have let this happen under my watch.

As I scrubbed, time distorted; minutes stretched into hours. The weight of the night pressed down like the oppressive air before a storm. I was trapped in a moment I couldn’t escape, and the feeling gnawed at me, a visceral dread that something unseen was still lurking in that desolate hotel.

Then I suddenly collapsed on the bed, realizing I was tripping on lsd.  The thin man in the bell-bottom had passed me acid on the candy.  I curled up in a ball wondering why he would do that.  I did long breathing in and out. I was glad I had signed up for that yoga class at the local YMCA. 

Part of me thought maybe none of it was real. I started to look up schizophrenia, thinking maybe that could explain what happened. 

But days turned into weeks and the incident slipped into whispers within the town. The rumors were that the woman admitted she was on acid with a strange man to the police and had flown out of the room thinking an octopus monster was after her.  

I actually ran into the man months later at the grocery store in the town next to the hotel. He stood casually, with a devil-may-care look on his face.  Our eyes met, and that recognition struck again, but this time, his expression felt something far more sinister—a predatory gleam.

I hurried past him, my heart pounding all the way into my ears, the supermarket becoming a dizzying blur of smells and sounds.  But then it hit me, he had dosed me that night at the hotel.  

I marched back to ask him. I came up so close I could see the green on his cowboy boots sticking out of his faded denim bell-bottoms.  I looked up at him, ""did they ever find your special Valentine friend?"" 

But he changed the subject, ""did you like the peppermint?  I made it myself for my special Valentine friend.""

And with that, I had my answers so I smiled at him. The puzzle was solved.   I wasn't going crazy. And I realized exactly what had happened the night of Room 12. It had been hard to discern if I was going insane.  I breathed a sigh of relief.  I knew now

 I realized I was the girl he had in Room 12. It was me that came running out.  I had realized I was, but it really made no sense.  Everyone in town had described her as looking exactly like me, wearing the exact outfit I was wearing. 

The next morning after my cinnamon rolls and coffee, I went to the sheriff's office to find out all I could about that night, to make a report that I think I was actually the woman that ran from the room because the man had possibly drugged me. 

No sooner did I tell them that they made several phone calls to that man's home.  There was no answer.  They called his employer but the employer said there was no man by that name.  

Police said there was nothing in the system for the name he had given.  Nobody had any IDs on them so the whole situation was just marked down as a drug incident.  

So I asked my very last question, ""Can you please tell me what name he gave you? I think he tried to sexually harrass me.""

Sexually harrassment wasn't a big deal back then like it is now, so Im not sure they really cared.  But I gave them my best puppy dog eyes. 

The rounder faced officer stood up, ""He said his name was Jack Straw from WItchita."" 

I left, knowing that was just a lyrics to a song I know.  He'd told them song lyrics and they believed him.  I spent years hoping to bump into him again.  I was going to give him citizen's arrest, or maybe teach him a lesson.  I wasn't sure.  But fate never helped me.

I always fantasized about being the type of person who subscribes to relevant journals in my field and reads them cover to cover over morning coffee on the weekend. 

While I do get some paper issues, it's 2024 and was wondering if y'all knew of any turnkey Android or iPhone apps that work basically like a Kindle where you can input your subscription logins and read the journals in a simple manner without seven hundred logins on a desktop to get to one PDF? 

I may be hoping for a unicorn but figured I'd ask. Thanks!

I'm seventeen, my brother is thirteen and our sister is five. We have three other brothers (20, 19, 19) who are irrelevant here.

Our sister is really typical youngest child, only girl - spoiled as hell, never behaves. You tell her to walk and she lays down. She strives to make everyone upset. Our mom starts crying and she starts giggling. She's also really delayed in speaking and screeches a lot. All the time. She's being assessed for autism or something. 

My brother has ADHD and ""anger issues"". I really don't think he has anger issues but whatever. He's impulsive and his natural impulse is to hit things but he's not an angry person.

The therapist my sister sees tells us to ignore the screaming. It's torture. She can scream for hours non stop. Throughout the night, all morning. She'll scream for anything. Tell her to stop and she just gets louder and higher.

Last week she was having one of her bad days. We were all losing our minds. She was having a great time. It was storming pretty bad so we had no escape (usually if she gets too much we will hide in the yard til she finds us) and my brother was agitated as hell.

They got into a pretty typical yelling match. He told her to shut up, she got louder, their dad started yelling at him to leave her alone, mom starts trying to calm him down, I have to take the dog out into the storm because he was freaking out with the noise (he has bitten due to being overwhelmed before, I think we need to rehome him). 

At some point during the chaos my brother got ahold of our sister and slammed her into the coffee table. She did hit her head so she had to go in to the ER. She was ultimately fine.

She's come home and they (parents, therapist) are saying she's been traumatised by the altercation. She seems fine to me - still annoying, still hitting, pinching and laughing at other peoples tears, but no longer screaming. She's started twice but the second she's spotted our brother she stops.

He's basically on house arrest. He isn't allowed to be unsupervised unless he's in his room. Mom had to beg their dad not to file a police 
report against him. He feels awful about it too.

I hate to say it but I'm really so glad he did it. I've never slept better. I can eat a meal without her screeching in my ear because I won't eat her chewed up food. She doesn't scream over the tv, she doesn't set the dog off anymore. 

Everyone is treating my brother like some kind of criminal and I'm just glad someone finally did something. I don't care if it's traumatised her. I'm so glad it happened. The only one I genuinely feel bad for is my brother. 

I feel like it makes me a terrible person and it's eating me up inside. She's five and we know screaming is her communication as much as it sucks. 

I just needed to put my thoughts somewhere, I guess. I can't talk to anyone else about it in case they really do think I'm a monster. ",427,1728867076.0,TrueOffMyChest,154,0.91,False
