Equipment- B75 with Kalita 155 filter, MHW-3BOMBER BLADE R3 89 clicks sifted with a 400 micron screen.



Note- Coffee has been rested for 20 days.



Method- 16 gms of coffee 40gm of bloom water bloomed for 45s. Pour1 70 gm in 15s and a 10s pause, Pour2 70gm in 20s and a 10s pause and the last pour ie Pour3 60gm in 20s draw down time of 3:00.

Flavor notes- Before I start the description I'm just blown away by how gorgeous it smells, its like a field of lavender and rose with slight hint of coffee oh so good so delicious and this coffee brings that to the cup. The first thing I noticed when I take the sip is aroma lavender and coffee, then as it gives way to superber flavours of lavender rose cardamom slight lychee nice lemon zest and since I sifted a slight peach on the end I cannot describe how gorgeous this coffee tastes this is my very first 10/10 its very different but superb coffee high highly recommended 10/10 no complains.



Comments- Sifting it with a 300/400 micron screen makes the slightest difference so if you want to you can but I will advise not to. Also V60 gives it more acidity and more lychee to it but in my opinion the B75 gave me the best flavors.

1ivfktl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1ivfktl/no_surf_and_lent/,No surf and Lent,"Lent is a 40 day period of religious preparation for Easter. Many Christians observe it by engaging in some form of fast: giving up something for the period. It might be chocolate or coffee or swearing or alcohol or anything you feel you need to limit in your life. Or it could be adopting a new practice to improve it: exercise, reading, budgeting etc.

Of course you don’t need to be religious to follow the practice. But it offers the opportunity to achieve a personal SMART objective: a goal that is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound.

For the r/nosurf community a lot of goals come to mind – giving up problem apps, social media as a whole, internet porn, online shopping. Anything relevant you can think of. 

I plan to spend each Sunday off the internet with the exception of a 15 minute Duolingo session. Last year I gave up Tiktok and have successfully stayed off the app since.

The other thing to remember is that everyone has their oversights and slip-ups won’t be failures unless you give up entirely.

Lent this year starts on Wednesday, 5 March and will continue through until Easter. If it interests you, take your time to think about a reasonable goal before then so you can get in the headspace to hit the ground running.",1,1740218781.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

1ivfhl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DentistPh/comments/1ivfhl8/heart_racing_and_infected_tooth/,Heart Racing and Infected Tooth,"Just want to share my experience. This is not scientific but rather my personal experience and observation. 

I got a gum and tooth infection for a year which I know now could be dangerous. I was abroad that time and don't have medical insurance so I waited and only got treated when I went home. 

Somehow, since pumutok yung infected na gums at nagrecede yung gums, siguro may way for the bacteria or infection to come out, at hindi na siya nagkakaroon ng infection. No pain as well. So I put off my tooth extraction though nirecommend na ng dentist based on my panoramic x-ray na need ng extraction due to infected molar tooth that goes all the way to the roots. 

Kahit walang pain or puss or visible signs of infection, the reason I got it extracted is because my heart is racing from time to time which I hadn't experienced before. Normal naman yung BP ko, nasa upper limit lang yung diastolic and heart rate but within normal limits. But I can feel something is off, madalas kumabog. I'm not factoring out paranoia rin but I also felt some bouts of confusion which again are unusual for me.

Maybe due to stress din because of the tooth extraction and other things. I also drink maximum of one Mcdo coffee a day or Nescafe Orignal which I tried to limit since I noticed my heart racing. But these things I normally do naman before without any problems. Nakaka-8 coffees nga ako noon. Also factor din siguro na I'm old now, at 38.   

But I have a gut feel na na it's because of the infected tooth that's why I had it extracted immediately. So far since my tooth extraction, wala pa naman akong nafi-feel na heart racing. Also less stress na rin siguro, and less paranoia that I don't have any active infection in my body. I'll wait for some time to observe my body since I just got my tooth extracted.

Did you also have a similar experience? Thanks for reading, I just like to share my experience.

PS. The difference of my tooth/gum infection  now from my decayed tooth when I was younger is closed ng fillings yung tooth ko kaya sa gums lumabas yung infection and I never had a gum infection before. ",1,1740218421.0,DentistPh,0,1.0,False

1ivfgbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1ivfgbf/ex_showed_up_at_my_workplace_with_another_guy/,"ex showed up at my workplace with another guy, found out what she'd been saying to people about me","me and my ex broke up around 4 months ago, she broke up with me because she wanted to ""improve herself"" gave me the ""its not you its me"", and said maybe someday we'd get back together but we would have to go no contact and i agreed, after the break up i waited 2 weeks to just ask her to meet so i could get my closure because i just had this gut feeling we weren't getting back together. we met up and we were just acting like we were still together, still doing cutesy things, our little inside jokes, and because of that i didn't get my closure because it gave me hope that we'd eventually get back together after a month or two. she then messaged me the next day promising that we'd get through this and we would never be apart, and it helped me truly believe that she meant that.

 now this is where it gets interesting, i messaged her around 2 months in of the no contact and got blocked on snapchat, i got a bit confused as i woke up to it but then she hadn't removed me off anything else so i just decided to ask her on Instagram why she blocked me and her reasoning was ""every time she opened snap it would remind her of us and she was trying to forget"" so from giving me a glimpse of hope that we could get back together quite literally from what she said, to shes just trying to forget about me, so i said i wouldn't message her anymore until she messaged me, then a few days ago happened. 

I was working doing my shift as normal (i work part time for extra money at restaurant), and she decided to show up with another guy, my heart honestly just got ripped out when i noticed, i didn't even see her face i could just tell from the perfume she would always wear, i knew it was her, my co workers confirmed it was her and i just had to walk out for some air, i went to the rooftop and just broke down, everything she said to me just felt like a lie, honestly i wasn't hurt as much by the fact she moved on even though it stung, i was more hurt by the fact she decided to bring another guy to my workplace while i was working, it just felt so disrespectful, i was her first everything, her first boyfriend, her first kiss, her first lover, i always treated her good, better then i treated myself, i put her above everything, and after all i did for her, she decided to just do this? i just cant understand why somebody would do that, i don't get it, I'm trying to understand, its not like it was a bad breakup, she had no reason to do that to me, but she did? 

i left work early because i just couldn't be there and watch and went to one of our mutual friends house, i was there with her and her boyfriend (both good friends of mine), and she told me that my ex broke up with me because she ""wanted me to be better"" not so we could both improve she wanted me to be better specifically.

 this was just wild to hear coming from her because i was there with her through uni, i helped her with everything and she then had the cheek to say i ""didn't want to be at her graduation?"" i paid for the fucking seats her parents sat on because she was panicking she wouldn't get them in time, she said there were limited amount of seats so i didn't push about me going and bought 3 for her parents and one for her grandma.

I asked her to tell me what else my ex said about the reasoning why we broke up and it was just all lies but anyway here's what she said.

I didn't take her on enough dates, we agreed once a month we'd go on one fancy date, something you can really dress up from the rest of the days we'd see each other we'd do things she liked, go for walks, cute coffee dates, even a rest day if she was really tired, but i always paid for everything, i treated her like gold, yet she had the audacity to say i didn't take her on enough dates.

Then we have the ""he didn't call me enough"" for the first year of us dating i wasn't allowed to call her because her parents were strict, i was fine with meeting them but i wanted to meet them in her own time so for basically a year only she was allowed to call, and i got used to it, for the other 6 months we dating i didn't call her enough, and honestly i can take the blame on that, i got used to her calling because i didn't want to get her into trouble but i would still text her throughout the day maybe that wasn't enough but it's not something to breakup over IMO.

and finally, i have severe insomnia, i have really bad trouble sleeping because of certain things that have transpired in my life and i can't sleep well or barely get enough sleep in general, so there were some days where our schedules wouldn't align, i did night shifts, she did day shifts, so some day's it was hard to meet in the week, she picked up 40 hours at a printing place, and she was busy most of the days, so while she would be working wanting me to call, id be asleep for the few hours i could, so id be able to function at work without having hallucinations, at first she was understanding about it, i told her even sleeping pills wouldn't work sometimes, but she decided to tell people that i never wanted to see her, i was just exhausted from work and lack of sleep.

but now she's moved on, and honestly, i think she's just a vile person for doing that to me, being so disrespectful towards me, my opinion of her has changed dramatically, and i couldn't ever see her the same, yet i honestly still do care for her, even after everything is said and done, part of me still cares and i hate myself for it.

I don't know why she did it but she did and I'm just confused, angry and hurt.

I have got under guarantee a brand new Sage Barista Express Impress (SES876). I have set everything the same like in the old one. Internal burr is on 5 and external is also on 5 and my coffee always comes almost perfect. Good pressure, 18g, ratio 1-3, sometimes 1-4 all in 30 seconds. But in this express I have a problem because pressure isn't even hit first espresso range and coffee is going to fast and I get 1-4 or 1-5 ratio in 24 seconds... I checked my grinder with a weight scale and it always grind 15 or 16,5 grams. But this sage system of tamping shows green face like it's enough coffee in basket. What do you think? It should be minimum 18 grams!!! Should I change to finer grinding the inside burr? When I grind in manual mode exactly 18 grams my coffee is perfect like always.

1ivfflt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1ivfflt/i_read_almost_every_post_here_i_want_to_share_for/,"I read almost every post here. I want to share. For a moment I felt like the best trader in the world. I was profitable for about 4 months and 40 trades. About %15 a week, daytrading, sometimes holding a position for 2 or 3 days at most.","Seeking ADVICE.   
I started trading about 5 years ago. I learned all the tricks and tips to being profitable very early on. No I didn't follow them. Following my methods I was profitable, but it is boring as shit and doesn't leave room for imagination. Through the years I've stumbled onto strategies that are profitable. I have 4 reliable and tested, and working on a 5th. Don't get me wrong, these are just simple set ups with little to no down side. The one that everyone knows, but it is not day trading, is just wheeling. You can make good money on that. But that's boring and tried and true for long term investors in stable stocks. The other ones seem complicated, but are simple, yet qualify as day trading, are very profitable yet never talked about. One of these gets me about 10% a month, and only requires me to make adjustments once or twice a week. A tad bit boring, but the money is nice. Then the one that I'd been testing last year, and I was scared to keep trying has been bold and it worked like a charm. 

I came up with this one on my own. I'm quite proud of it. I started with the goal of making 5% per trade. Ended up with wildly different results. About 1/4 of my trades ended up with 5-10% losses, which was definitely at times I shouldn't have been placing trades(like they all say). Other trades were wildly higher, since I dont have an upper limit of when I close, just when I feel like it is enough. I ended up making about 15% every week on average. I almost doubled my account every month for 4 months straight, while I also kept withdrawing some money and blowing it on nice things because that's what makes the sacrifice worth it. Recommend. 

Suddenly money was no object, and just like that money lost all value. The chaos of the 2 weeks of the pause in earnings and the chaos of January threw me off. I had days of randomly gambling on SPX (because I was trying to avoidwash sales, not trading on any of the regular names that I knew well, which i had traded in December), and after a few trades of making +10k, I just stopped thinking about my strategy. 

I no longer saw money as real, I didnt even care if I lost anymore, because I knew that I knew how to make it all back if I felt like it. Insane. I know you must be thinking that I was probably lucky and manic, which is all i could think too. But the funny thing is that I stopped putting money into the market last year because I became profitable. I don't need any of the money anymore. I realized that I literally was trying to get profitable so that I dont have to put any ""real"" money into the market anymore and not have to try to explain to my wife why I needed more. Now, I'm free. My wife has left me. Lol, jk. Now, i get to extract money and buy stuff for her. 

So where is the problem? Well, since I can't feel anything from the money anymore, I'm just throwing money into 0dte SPX options to see if I can catch the trend and day trade those options. Honestly, it's the fact that 1 word from 1 person can throw the market into turmoil any day, with the market being so fragile to headlines, I don't find my own strategies that profitable on a day to day basis. For instance, I can recover all my losses in a single trade, and I have multiple times this year-to-date alone. Today I just didnt even care, so I slept in and didnt trade; missed opportunity. 

So far, I have basically lost 50% of my profits from the point that i became profitable. But I guess I just look at it as just house money now. Also, this is the second time in the past 2 months that I have lost and made back and lost that same amount. So again... no lesson learned, so I'm still considering it daytrading but IDK.   
  
The thing is, how much money do I need to be happy? Not too much I think.   
Another thing that I realized was that I was worried about money, and I needed money to solve the problems of money. Which it did. But once I had all the money I needed, and money became meaningless, all the other real life problems became glaringly clear. I realized that the Money didn't give me extra time with my kids, and it didnt give me extra time with my wife, and it didnt even give me extra time because I was still trying to earn money. Honestly maybe im just depressed about the state of the world. I'm no fan of stress. 

So anyway...I guess i'm writing this because I have no one else (other than my wife who listens but doesnt understand what i'm doing or going through) to talk about this stuff. 

Sorry, I went off on a tangent. But I guess it is relevant to the advice that i'm seeking. I don't know what to do. I feel like I stumbled onto something that seems too good to be true, but has proven pretty real so far. I'm afraid of finding out that I was actually just a moron getting lucky every month, and that I should quit while I'm ahead. I tried to test it, using the 40 trades thing, and I feel like that gives it legitimacy. I don't know how much I can scale it, but I'm a small fish still. Should I just continue on with the trading even though I find it just so boring now. What really excited me was discovering and testing new methods and strategies. And that's why i'm always working on something new even though i have a few easy ones that already pretty much guarantee money. I have one that literally guarantees that i'll make money, but just takes a longer time frame. It did 5x over the course of about 5 months, and the win was guaranteed, but the amount wasnt. Anyway, I'm not sure if im allowed to make any statements without providing receipts, but I just need someone to understand what I'm going through, and maybe someone who has had a similar problem. I definitely have imposter syndrome. I also have a problem with doing the same mundane repetitive tasks, especially without co workers. I don't think people really realize how lonely it is without co workers. I wish I could have a nice normal desk job, but I have no skills. I could probably fill out excel sheets by hand, but AI is already doing that job now. I was thinking of going to work at a local coffee shop so I can have someone to talk to. 

P.S. Forgive me, I hope you will understand that I cannot share my methods. I am here for YOUR advice on daytrading lifestyle. The only advice I can give is that you should follow the advice that you see repeated on this sub over and over, the same 5 rules or something; i promise that if you are to ever become profitable, it will not be without following those rules.

I don't care what Caitlyn says about me, it's probably to deflect from her shitty behavior.

I didn't do any drugs with Kyra, and I don't know why the fuck she would suggest to study in the library next to the construction site. I'm sorry for being so naive?

And my fucking mom. I'm always thinking about her, letting her have her way, and it always gets me in trouble.

For example, she asked me to go to work with her, then she'll take me shopping. I wanted to stay home, but she sounded unhappy to pick me up from home, so I went with her. I got exposed to benzene while waiting for her in the fucking car.

We went shopping, she asked me to go out first, I didn't want to but I still did because I listen to my mom- and it smelt like a bag of donuts exploded.

I was accused of vaping because I walked through vape smoke and didn't move. Apparently you have to move away from vape and weed and cigarettes, or else it means you're doing it.

How am I supposed to know that? I don't even do that stuff.

Then when we came home, one of the neighbors or construction workers nearby smoked a fucking joint and I thought it was just a bad case of coffee urine. The construction was also super loud. I wanted to go outside but my mom was in bed already. I didn't want to disturb her so I did my own thing and tried to drown out the noise.

And smelling drugs? Man people love to eat every shit I write on Reddit or on my phone notes or from my song lyrics.

At this point, I'm done, I'm ready to close Reddit and just find another place to vent.

I was assaulted at work, outside of work, I did not experience a hallucination or psychosis because of drugs. I only said I was 'crazy' so PEOPLE COULD LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE.

Also, I'm always nicest to the people who hurt me the most or are the most ill-intended towards me. I'm pretty sure this is fawning response. How do I stop?

I own an espresso machine that has been working fine for about 10 months, but recently, it started showing error messages. When I opened the compartment where the used coffee grounds are collected, I found this loose piece (attached in the images).

I took the machine to the service center, and they returned it, saying it was “repaired.” Now, it does brew coffee, but the coffee is completely watery and undrinkable. They also claimed that the machine was “improperly used,” even though I’ve only used tap water (which might have some limescale).

A few questions for anyone familiar with espresso machines:
	1.	Does anyone recognize what this part is and where it might have come from?
	2.	Could limescale buildup in just 10 months actually cause something like this?
	3.	Is it reasonable for the service center to blame improper use when a part was clearly found loose inside the machine?
	4.	Any suggestions on what I should do next?

1ivf7l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1ivf7l3/all_on_the_verge_of_pneumonia/,[All] On the verge of pneumonia,"In P15, Ed rushed to the RR Diner to tell Norma that Nadine had given him his freedom. However, Norma had clearly moved on and only gave Ed condoling looks when Walter arrived to see her. She and Walter were seemingly very happy together. Miserable Ed was left alone at the counter.

Then at 07:00, there was a sudden 180 in the story. Vaguely referring to ""family reasons"", cheerful Norma started dumping Walter and their mutual business. Letting Walter find his own way out, she rushed to Ed's arms.

In quick succession, Norma first rejected Ed and walked off with Walter, only then to reject Walter and rush back to Ed. This wasn't performed as a twist but as a bafflingly inconsistent narrative. Furthermore, earlier in P13, Walter and Norma's relationship was already displayed as strained, yet it was now back to a loving one, only to immediately fall apart next.

[La donna è mobile but not this mobile.](https://preview.redd.it/zd8iz2dnqnke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23f15c586c0855f0a82dab134b37691fe61d75b1)

No conventional narrative could block the holes of this size, so let's look for the unconventional one. A whole lot of something was missing in the seemingly non-existent meanwhile.

Elsewhere in P6, Albert went to a bar and found Diane sitting at the counter by herself. They greeted each other, and while their faces were not easy to read, it did not look like an unhappy reunion.

However, an episode later in P7, this became another abrupt inconsistency  when Albert told Cole how Diane had been seethingly hostile right from the beginning. According to Albert, she outright rejected his offer to help them with Cooper, and there was no more to it.

So we had three men going to see women and getting rejected. Each rendezvous was openly contradicted by expectations based on what he had seen earlier. 

In related conclusions, providing an opening to make sense of what was going on, [it seems there were two Alberts in the story](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1ioyt4h/all_tin_man/). The likely original would have gone to the Black Lodge and died there, with the Lodge waiting room appearing to him as the bar in P6. Based on the continuity of his story cracking in P7, that may have been the moment when the new Albert entered the plot.

We got more to work with when the assumed new Albert concluded his story about the meeting with Diane.

>Albert: ""I was at home, dripping wet, on the verge of pneumonia *15 minutes later*.""

[Richard got soaked and started coughing, but it probably wasn't pneumonia.](https://preview.redd.it/v4f4top3rnke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dcbb76871eabe0f443b07116ecd509682e59a481)

Going back to the similarly inconsistent narrative in the RR Diner, the exact point when the continuity cracked was at 07:00. Mollified by Norma's uninterest, Ed was asking for a cyanide tablet which cut to Norma unexpectedly starting to dump Walter. Exactly *15 minutes later* in the episode at 22:00, Mr C - held at gunpoint by Richard in front of the Convenience Store - swept the gun off from the man's hand, punched him in the face and gave him a good kicking. Lying on the ground, Richard was *coughing*.

If you are on the verge of pneumonia, coughing is an early symptom. On the other hand, if you are dripping wet, then you are *soaked*. That also means being punched, beaten up or physically assaulted, like Richard was.

Quite surprisingly then, the Albert who gave Cole a mismatching report about his meeting with Diane was suggested to have been **the same character as the Richard who got beaten up** by Mr C. A further implication was that this was somehow tied to the love triangle in the RR Diner. Clearly, we were not getting anything even remotely resembling average television.

[Someone was outside the gas station, with a metal barrel.](https://preview.redd.it/m8qlk09ernke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1045a3ec9bea474b5165c0c9b85672598b6b948b)

With a pair of pumps, the magical Convenience Store was also a derelict *gas station*. Earlier in P13, Ed was having a slow evening at his gas station when he noticed something strange going on with his reflection in the window. At 57:00, it looked as if the reflection was out of synch and had a significant lag, only now displaying an earlier moment when he lifted the cup of RR Diner corn soup and put it back on the table.

The malfunctioning reflection was right above *a metal barrel*. Later in P15, outside the other gas station, the Convenience Store, the first that we got of Richard waiting for Mr C was *the metal barrel of his gun* that he pointed at the doppelganger. 

The scenes were also connected through *smoke*. While Ed took a small piece of paper and lit it on fire, creating some smoke, the Convenience Store was engulfed in smoke after Mr C and Richard drove away, and the building disappeared entirely.

[He drowned his pain and sorrow in coffee, and it turned into garmonbozia.](https://preview.redd.it/mdkn7p0ornke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=664a6ec3be8911e562dfc7ac75601f082a5a58bd)

Back in the RR Diner, deep in pain and sorrow after Norma's rejection, Ed got a cup of coffee. He didn't drink his coffee, but held the cup in his hands and closed his eyes.

*I was at home, dripping wet, on the verge of pneumonia 15 minutes later*. Ed's scene at the gas station started with a shot of his hands holding the cup of corn soup. In *Fire Walk with Me*, corn soup was likened to mysterious garmonbozia, explained to be ""pain and sorrow"". It was also this cup that moved inconsistently in Ed's reflection.

The possible interpretation of the quite astonishingly complex narrative is that **the Ed who went to see Norma and got rejected was not Ed at all** but someone else in a new version of his story. This Ed would have briefly appeared as the lagging reflection in the window. Next, like implied by the barrel, **he would have turned into Richard**, holding Mr C at gunpoint and getting soaked. 

When Ed closed his eyes at the counter, he would have gone back home. But the home of this character was the Convenience Store, and he didn't need to really move to get back there.

Lynch blurring hard the dreams and reality (as expected), the actual and imaginary Ed would become difficult to tell apart. But it seems we got the real one alone there in his gas station, sipping corn soup, knowing there was not much to look forward any more. The extended purpose of the scene would have been to act as an intermediary between the P15 scenes in the RR Diner and outside the Convenience Store.

[The \\""free\\"" one went back home but stayed outside, risking pneumonia.](https://preview.redd.it/0mojq8fasnke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e6f7dd6e98829cb449787d852b5a4a8cb1dd499)

Further suggesting this, there was an A-frame signpost in front of Ed's gas station. The post had a large title ""FREE"" on top of it, the entity on the outside - first appearing as Ed's glitching reflection and then as Richard - to the Ed who was first told by Nadine he was ""free"" and who then rushed to repeat that to Norma before being rejected. As it seems, he got back home to the Convenience Store by closing his eyes at the counter while Otis Redding was singing, ""And you want to be *free*"". A lot of things needed to be done before he would be back there and this Norma turned around.

[Looks like someone is going to die in the fire at his station.](https://preview.redd.it/qjmojn7fsnke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=890cbf8c1f1106760bc147efdf9d3529de8c52fd)

As for the real Ed, the apparent counterpart of his gas station being engulfed in smoke and vanishing might have indicated a major tragedy followed soon after the credits rolled in P13. Also outside, there was a stern warning asking not to make any fires, yet that was what downcast Ed did.

But back to the Ed who would have carried on. In P7, this mystery character would have adopted Albert's likeness and taken his place next to Cole. This would have been at some point after getting beaten by Mr C. Where did he show up from and who was he really?

As Cole was whistling in his office, we got a separate shot of the door. It had semi-translucent glass behind which *Albert knocked four times*. The sound was unnecessarily loud, and Cole was startled.

[He comes knocking at the door four times.](https://preview.redd.it/ucufkwvmsnke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32e7d95f123fae382ee395dc96af9ce7d5526202)

Later in P12, someone else was at another door. Hawk walked slowly up the stairs to the Palmer's house and started knocking at the door. Before Sarah finally opened, we got a ghostly shot of Hawk through the glass that was covered by a semi-translucent sheer curtain. He knocked at the door again, *four times*.

Unusually smiley Hawk's scene with Sarah ended abruptly when she closed the door and left him standing in front of the semi-translucent curtain. This roughly matched where Albert was when his scene started in P7, knocking at another door with a semi-translucent window four times.

Perhaps then, we got hints that **this man wasn't Deputy Hawk at all but the same slippery character again**, now in Hawk's likeness. In line with this idea, there was nothing about Hawk having to do with what happened to Sarah in any other scene. His meeting at her door was an isolated subplot, and it didn't seemingly go anywhere either.

[A fan and a Tom make the Phantom.](https://preview.redd.it/43rcwpzusnke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1ba5061d4d9bc288f1b63005279d4203bac21bb)

But perhaps it did serve another purpose as well. Before Sarah opened the door, the scene kept cutting between Hawk and the Palmer's iconically ominous ceiling fan. Like u/raspfan has realised, visual combination of a *fan* and a *Tom* \- in this case then Tommy ""Hawk"" Hill - would suggest the character in Hawk's likeness was [the Phantom](https://inland-empire.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom), brought over from Lynch's last movie, [Inland Empire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460829/) (2006). In the movie, the mysterious antagonist was able to create dreamlike illusions and adopt different physical appearances, fitting with what this character seemed to be able to do in Return.

Now then, if this Hawk was actually the Phantom in disguise, then the other characters linked to him - namely the discussed versions of Ed, Richard and Albert - would also have been his incarnations, respectively.

In P7, this Albert's story continued with a visit to Diane's apartment. There was a nameless character credited as Younger Man just about to get going. Him and Diane seemed to be in a kind of recurring situationship. On his way out, the man sent Diane a kiss which wasn't reciprocal.

[The transcendental love triangle.](https://preview.redd.it/stnqp4x5tnke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b556a37e5d5a28ef978f3c4b950deb7b5b9943a)

Reflecting that to the idea that this Albert was the rejected Ed from the diner, then Younger Man would have been Walter and the scene in thematic continuation of him and Norma walking away from Ed in P15. This would suggest **the angry Diane was the same character as the Norma who chose Walter over Ed**, their story now playing out in a new illusion, with everyone involved having new faces and identities.

Thus then, all three characters accompanying Cole in Diane's apartment were implied to have been some kind of supernatural entities in a sort of high concept love triangle. Surrounded by such beings, Cole might not have been where he thought he was but stuck in a strange dream.

Don't challenge Goliath the first day you graduate from swordfighting school: Now, I don't know whether David actually fought Goliath with a sword or used another weapon, but the point is don't make your first spell to be about a high-stake, life-changing transformation. My first proper spell was about something big in career. As a result, my energy levels were very low days after the spell, my immunity was very weak and the spell didn't work the way it was intended. First build your confidence by using spells for low stake things that don't shake your belief whatever the result is. Go step by step.

For ADHD witches, instead of holding a grand, lengthy ceremony where our attention will hop like a butterfly from one thing to another, incorporate craft in your already existing habits in your routine. For example, if you are fond of drinking tea or coffee, learn about tea and coffee magic. If you are required to rest and don't have many opportunities to be outdoors, learn about safe dream witchery and hedgeriding. Instead of alloting time for craft separately, if you are short on time and have issues in focusing, make your already existing habits witchy.

If you've trouble raising energy for a ritual, use your five senses. Drumming music is very helpful in raising and purifying energy. Flute music is helpful in achieving trance state. Incense can also help you to focus. Find your primary sense and use this knowledge to deepen your spell or ritual.

This is my personal correspondence and it may differ for people. But I've observed if I want to perform magick for becoming something (like becoming more calm, creative, or anything), I prefer water element. Like you can speak your intention into a cup of water and stir it clockwise if you want to become 'more' of something. For sending a wish, I prefer air element. Like speak your wish into an already fallen leaf or flower (don't pluck a flower or leaf preferably), and blow it out to the universe. For getting something external, air is more preferable element for me. For building something (like building wealth or relationship), write your intention on a leaf and bury it into earth as earth element is more preferable for long term, durable magick. As an example: If your desire is to win a coveted project for yourself, air magick is preferable as it's a very specific, one-time intention. But if your desire is I want to build a financially successful, stable career in long term, earth is the preferable element for this general, gradual intention.

5. Don't sleep on blogs and kids' stories: I know vlogs/podcasts/books are more popular resources for craft, but some blogs are gold when it comes to knowledge as they don't have the compulsion to fill the one hour duration for an episode or fill 300 pages. Also kids' stories sometimes contain a very valuable insight when it comes to craft.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2h0qw8/i_cheated_on_my_pregnant_wife_nearly_a_year_ago/)

\[Remorse\]:

I met an amazing woman nearly 6 years ago and the relationship was far from perfect which would be a common circumstance that anyone in a relationship would find themselves in.

There were a lot of stressful variables in the first 3 to 4 years of our relationship that made things really hard. For one I was working abroad in some incredibly remote places in the world where all we had was a crappy skype connection and the will to just want to see each others faces as it was the only thing that used to make me happy in those evenings where I found myself alone. I used to come home every 3 months to spend 2 weeks with my girlfriend and her son. I would have just stayed home and said screw this stupid job I had, but I couldn't get a job where my girlfriend lives because from a European country and I am American. I tried so hard to find a job and it never happened because I couldn't get a resident permit.... and I couldn't get a resident permit because I didn't have a job. Terrible circumstance to be in. The stress that this circumstance put us in caused us to fight a lot for all sorts of reasons that I can't even remember now. I still loved her despite it all.

We got married 3 years into our relationship and everything finally started coming together. I got a residence permit to live in her country and 2 days after I got it, I got my dream job. Everything started to look up finally.

Getting married didn't necessarily stop the fighting. My wife was very insecure about everything which often made things really hard on us. On top of that, I know that I had my share of personality flaws as well. I tend to get a bit belligerent when I've had to much to drink and there were a few times I said a lot of nasty things because she found me to be embarrassing when I've had too much to drink. At the time I didn't really realize how unpleasant I was being and I think I didn't even care too much at the time. I was certain that all the problems that we had was her fault. I used to fantasize about leaving but I stayed because of personal conviction despite all the problems we were having. I had been supporting her for most of this time and once she finished school, she wanted to find a job. But at the age of 35, she also wanted another baby. So I suggested that we try to do both and we'll go with whatever comes first. On the day after she got her job interview, we found out she was pregnant. My initial reaction was fear as I don't have any children and I knew that this would lock me into maintaining a relationship with her forever. With her being pregnant, her hormones were crazy and it seemed that we were fighting more and more all the time. One time her son her us fighting and he just ran around the apartment before he ran to his room and closed the door. Just typing that out breaks my heart because as much as it bothered him... I can't for the life of me remember what it was we were fighting about.

I'd say when my wife was about 8 months pregnant I met this woman at work and we became good friends. I would look at her and see all the things I wished my wife was. Secure, assertive and we have a lot in common. We're both musicians, we're both avid runners, we both enjoyed the same foods, good scotch, jazz music.. you name it... we both liked it. I became so enamored with her and I quickly started resenting my wife. All this is happening leading up to the birth of my daughter.

My wife goes into labor and I am with her and doing the best job I can to be the best husband I could be while every chance I got, checking my phone to see if my new friend from work had sent me an email. My daughter was born and it was one of the happiest days of my life though I totally didn't feel it at the time. I was still trying to make heads or tails of witnessing a baby coming into the world while feeling a bit weird about the situation I was having with my wife and this new woman that came into my life. I fantasized about leaving. All the weeks and couple of months after my daughter was born I would daydream about being free. I would share these thoughts with my new friend and she felt the same way about me. She was in a similar situation as well being married and having kids of her own. We would talk over emails and share all of our deepest thoughts about everything life was throwing at us. Then one day my wife got my phone and read the emails.

Once she read them, everything kind of snowballed from there. I was scared, excited and I felt liberated while she was just crushed. I mean, I don't think I have ever seen someone in so much pain and while I felt guilty for inflicting this on her, a part of me was just ready to go. I managed to find myself an apartment and I moved out. A couple of months after that, we got divorced.

It's been 6 months since I moved out. I wish I can say that all the things I thought we going to be better would have happened in such a fashion, but that hasn't been the case. I get to see my daughter twice a week for a handful of hours at a time. My life rests inside a dark cloud on those days where I don't have my daughter and the sun shines when I do. 5 out of the 7 days during the week I am sad. Actually, I am pathetic. I am still seeing the woman I met at work but the rain cloud that follows me has kept me in this dark place. I don't enjoy any of the things I used to enjoy. I don't enjoy playing music anymore, I don't run anymore... hell, I don't even really enjoy sex anymore. I miss my exwife and twice a week I get to see her and it's so hard every time. She begged me to work things out and I wouldn't listen. I told her it was too late and that I am moving on. Except I am now realizing that I haven't moved on at all.

I don't have any friends. I used to, but they all stopped talking to me after I left my wife. I never really had a support network to lean on through this whereas my exwife had all of our friends and now she was someone new in her life as well. That doesn't bother me so much. At this point I want her, her son and my daughter to be happy and after all that I've done to my family, I really hope that they will be.

My girlfriend has noticed the increasing distance between us and she knows I am really down. I've told her that this isn't about her but she doesn't really see it that way. I know that this isn't going to last and when it doesn't, I'm really going to have no one. I live in a country that isn't my own where the only friends and family I ever had here were the ones I met through my exwife. I think that scares me as well because I am going to have to start all over again.

I deserve every bit of grief that I am feeling. I would do anything to have taken my exwife's hands when she begged me to stay and work on this. My thoughts drift into really dark places and the only thing that keeps my head above the water is the fact I have this beautiful little girl and she needs her Dad. I've made a promise to myself and to her that despite the ugly things I did to her Mom, I would be the best Dad I could possibly be. And even there, I feel as if I am lacking, but I am really trying my best.

I've never really shared so much of this story, so thanks for reading and I am sorry that I had to share. There so many more details to this but I just can't stomach having to type anymore while my emotions are getting the better of me. I feel as though I am the lowest of the low and I would do anything to know how to climb out of this deep dark hole I've been laying in.

Again, thanks for reading.

>How could you possibly have been trying to be the best husband if your attention wasn't fully focused on your wife, but rather at least partly on the attentions of a woman who made *you* feel good in the short term? I'm not trying to beat you up, but you asked how to climb out of the hole you've been wallowing in -- the first step to doing that is to be completely honest with yourself concerning your role in past mistakes, so as not to repeat them. No more bullshitting yourself. It's the only hope you have: to live a better life based on learning from those mistakes, and you must do that now because you are a father and your child looks up to you. You cannot change the past, and I think now you will remember that next time you think of so carelessly gambling with one of the only things in life that really matter -- your family.

>You damn near destroyed the life of this woman who is the mother of your child, who was faithful to you in difficulty even as you were throwing it all away. And you are paying penance for that as you should. Only time and new-found wisdom, and a willingness to act on that wisdom going forward, can come close to redeeming you after all this damage your betrayal has caused, but you have to do the tough work. The word you used was perfect -- climb. It's not a stroll.

**OOP**

>I wasn't the best husband at all, I was just doing everything I thought I was physically and verbally supposed to do as my exwife was in labor. What she needed most was to actually have all of myself present with her rather than the crap I gave her. I am so ashamed.

>I had a cup of coffee with her today since I had my daughter today. As of late, I often apologize to her for destroying our family. She appreciates it and says she welcomes the fact that I still want to talk about it. I denied her much of that when everything came apart. Talk is cheap, but I think it helps. I always make myself available to her as I take every single moment possible to see my daughter and to assist her with anything if she needs it. She says she needs more than that from me if I want us to ever become friends again, but I fear that there has been so much damage that I will never be able to repair the damage that has been done. I'm going to do my best.

>This has been the single most excruciating experience of my life and I will never, ever do this again.

>I really appreciate your tough love post. Thanks for it.

**Kac3rz**

>If there is someone new in your ex-wife's life, you have to realize there will be someone else besides you, who for all intents and purposes, will be her dad.

>If you really want your ex-wife and your daughter to be happy, you'll be forced to accept that fact as well.

**OOP**

>I had coffee with her today and saw this lovely bouquet of flowers in a vase on her kitchen table. The vase sat on this ceramic tile that said ""Every time I see you smile, I fall in love all over again."" With a slight grin, I told her that her flowers were very pretty. She lit up with a big smile.I can see that he treats her very well and I can't think of any one more deserving than her.

>Due to my daughter's age, she is staying with her mom for the time being and when she's older, we are going to gradually over a few years work our way to a split custody scenario where I have her for 7 days and she'll have her for 7 days. I'll come around to her having another ""dad"" in her life, but I'll always be her dad. I hope that her new boyfriend has a postive impact on their lives, they really deserve it.

So basically, I have been going out with this girl since summer last year. We hit it off almost immediately when I joined her workplace, were texting lots, then we kissed, then kept meeting up at work for walks etc,  a week later I went back to hers and nothing happened other than us staying up all night talking. 

At this stage it had been about 3 weeks and there was an obvious connection there. The next morning I helped her pack for a trip away, when she told me she was staying with some friends. I kissed her goodbye in the house as car pulled up outside to pick her up. Months later she admitted that weekend she away with this guy she was seeing but ""trying to end it with at the time"".

My GF got cheated on earlier that year, and this guy was a FWB rebound. This guy was a constant source of anxiety at the beginning. One of our friends at work first told me about him on a night out, but when I first brought it up to her at the time, she kept saying it ""didn't matter"". Then I later found out that she ended it with him about a month into us unofficially seeing eachother, but insists that weekend was the only time things happened. Regardless, there has been endless drama with this guy and I don't know if I'm crazy or if there's something there. 

There has been endless events with this guy that have made me feel uneasy throughout our relationship. Even though we weren't exclusive, helping her pack whilst being oblivious to where she was going hurt and has messed with my trust. 

After ending it with him, she met up with him a week later for several hours, she only told me this at the very last minute as well, which upset me. This involved him saying how much he liked her and wanted to keep seeing her. This also involved him knocking on the door to the house and ringing the house while I was in bed with her - a situation I found INSANELY uncomfortable. We agreed never again.

About 10 days later, they meet up several times to discuss her potentially moving into his old apartment if he takes a job in another city. I knew from the beginning that he was using this as an excuse just to see her, but she needed to find a place so she met up with him. No surprise to me when he ended up not moving away... Anyway after these encounters her tone changed from ending it with him to being his friend. I voiced that it's not really a friendship if half of the participants have feelings for the other, but she disagreed.  

For the whole summer, they are texting a lot and it makes me feel very uncomfortable. Like when I'm in bed with her, I would see constant message from him. 

By the end of July, we had basically spent every day together and the relationship was amazing besides this. I asked her out at the end of July. They stop texting for a while during August as he's away and we are very happy together. We agree that she will move into my apartment. The only issue is that she was lots of stuff and only one person has a car, the guy she used to see. Shes anxious about there not being space for all her stuff in my apartment and doesn't want to upset my new roommates, she she wants to keep her stuff in the guys garage. I express my discomfort with this, but at the last minute (on the day) she is very anxious about the stuff so I give in and let her do it. 

She cycles to his house in the rain, picks up the stuff with him and leave it in his storage. Then she goes for beers with him to thank him. When she texts me this, I tell her that I'm not comfortable with it and she comes home fairly promptly. The next day, I find his jacket in the bag and she tells me that she wore his clothes because of the rain. This is something that I can understand, but it upsets me because I just don't believe she should be wearing the clothes of this guy, in his apartment where they used to see eachother. It just feels inappropriate. 

Time goes on and they continue texting. She consistently insists that they're 'just friends' but it's very clear to me that hes still not over her. He's trying to meet up with her lots, but she ends up making excuses because she knew I was uncomfortable with it. 

It turned into a balancing act for her, she felt anxious about how her continued friendship to this guy made me feel, but also felt guilty for cutting off this guy who had been supportive to her. 

Similar events happen when she finally collects her stuff from his storage, this time they go to the beach. I feel this is also inappropriate (she only ever tells me these things at the last minute/or after the event). 

She also tells me when they meet up for coffee etc at work, but eventually I tell her that she doesn't need to do this as I try to accept it a bit more. At this stage she was telling me that if I told her to stop contacting him, she would. But I didn't want to be restrictive, so I said no. I just didn't want her to keep meeting up with him at places that feel a bit more inappropriate, like in his apartment or on the beach alone etc. 

In November, we are both moving away. She goes for ramen with this guy as a going away thingy (after I said it was okay). After this, on our last day at work I express that Im still uncomfortable with the friendship and would appreciate if she stopped texting him. On our last work drinks, she talks to him a bit, then apologies and I say it's okay (meaning this particular encounter), then she spends the rest of the night talking to him. This upset me again as we had talked about how I was uncomfortable with it earlier that day.

She ends up leaving her bike with him to hand it back to the shop. Weeks later she is texting him about the bike. I see she sent him a 🥰 emoji which upsets me. She explains that the emoji means nothing to her and that she sends it to everyone (this is true but I still feel she shouldn't send it to him). She agrees to cut things off with him. A month later he is still texting her and she admits she doesn't know how to end the friendship. 

Then the following month he texts her again to say happy birthday, then a week later he texts her again about something random and she finally calls him to explain that their friendship makes me uncomfortable and she would rather go their separate ways. She told him that they can still text occasionally as they are 'not enemies', so this month she texted him happy birthday. 

I think the nature of the beginning gave me trust issues. I still wonder about what exactly happened when they were meeting up in the early summer last year, but maybe this is just my paranoia. It's worth noting that while she was seeing this guy, she persistently said she didn't want a relationship, and this was never the case from the moment we started seeing eachother. I believe she wanted to end it with him and don't really believe she likes him, but there's a part of my mind that feels unresolved. Also our mutual friend that knew my GF when she was seeing this other guy (the girl that first told me about him) was baffled at how much this bothered me, she my GF clearly picked me over him. 

It's worth noting that my GF is very attractive and hence gets a lot of male attention. There has been lots of instances with guys at work expressing interest. She often tries to look beyond it to search for friendship. Sometimes I think it's inappropriate though because she lets them tell her how pretty she is. Idk if that's a reasonable excuse but it also adds to my trust issues. 

I think she's a good person and I want to let this go. Why is this still unresolved in my mind (I had a dream about it last night)? I need advice on how to let this go and trust her.

TL;DR: My GF kept get FWBs as a friend and it gave me trust issues, she has now cut him off but something is still bothering me.",0,1740216878.0,relationship_advice,0,0.33,False

1ivf1iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1ivf1iq/keep_on_walking_and_talking/,Keep on Walking and Talking,"Just wanted to share some advice from one individual that sometimes has to overhink to much to another individual.

'Keep on talking', I've learned, that what ever happens, in dating, relationships or friendships, you got to keep communicating to each other. The other cannot look into your mind and she what is going on and how you feel, unless you tell them. Being quietly waiting till they notice is not what you want.

There is no right or wrong, saying something stupid and the right person accepts your apologies. Not feeling well, let them know, they'll accept you not being well and, the good people, will try to help you out.

'Keep on walking', we all are anxious sometimes, scared for the unknown. We look to far in the future and already see ourselves going on holidays with your crush in bring them coffee to bed. There is nothing wrong looking a bit further to see if they'll be compatible with you, done also by asking some good question. 

Don't fall in the trap to get to formiliarized with that person you just met online or a few times in person and think you know all about them, you don't.

The keep on walking refers to the speed of actions. We men, and some women too, tend to wanting to go to fast if it feels good or sometimes not good at all. We start running to keep them with us while we should keep walking and keep an eye on the other person.

Is the other person maybe a bit slower or just a bit fast? You need to make sure you 'keep walking the same speed' or you'll lose one another in the process.

No, it’s not about ending a relationship - it’s when couples choose to sleep separately for the sake of better rest. While it might sound extreme, it’s becoming more common as people prioritize quality sleep over sharing a bed.

# Why Do Couples Choose Sleep Divorce?

🚨 **Snoring** – One partner’s snoring can disrupt sleep and lead to exhaustion.  
🚨 **Different Sleep Schedules** – Night owls and early birds often struggle to sync.  
🚨 **Restless Sleeping** – Tossing, turning, or sleep talking can disturb the other person.  
🚨 **Temperature Preferences** – One likes it cold, the other needs warmth.  
🚨 **Bed Space Issues** – Some need extra space to sleep comfortably.

# How to Reduce the Need for Sleep Divorce

💡 **Address Snoring** – Try nasal strips, side sleeping, or see a doctor if it’s severe.  
💡 **Invest in a Bigger Bed** – A king-size mattress can create personal space.  
💡 **Use Separate Blankets** – This prevents tug-of-war fights in the middle of the night.  
💡 **Sync Sleep Schedules** – Adjust bedtime routines to match better.  
💡 **Try Earplugs or White Noise** – Block out disruptive sounds.  
💡 **Compromise with a ""Hybrid Sleep Setup""** – Sleep together on weekends, apart on busy nights.

While sleeping apart can improve rest, maintaining **emotional closeness** is key. Make time for cuddles, bedtime chats, or morning coffee together! ☕💞

As the title says, I am starting to become worried about my husband. For some background, we live on a small farm and ranch out of town but he also rents farmland on an island in the south, and also has a solar farm in the nearby desert village. 

Now, when we were dating I knew he was always busy with some project, whether running into the nearby mines to get materials, or going on fishing expeditions, spelunking with the local cool guys with swords, or just working on his farm and ranch, but when we got married and I moved in I realized how insane his life schedule was. He goes to sleep at 2 in the morning, sometimes in the bed sometimes on the floor in the living room, and wakes up at 6. His first thing he does is drink coffee, eats a recipe that my dad learned in the army or a spicy eel, and then goes to work. Sometimes I only see a glimpse of him before he is running around. We talk in the mornings though, he tells me what the plan is and I tell him mine, I try to help around the farm where I can.

As much as I get worried, I love him, he works so hard, so I want to help him. But recently he changed. It is no longer just coffee he is drinking. He has a morning coffee, then a few hours later some espresso, then another espresso, then another one before finally he gets to sleep, and I noticed he also has been eating some kind of rock candy too a lot more than usual. He told me how the rock candy is caffeine, but... I don't believe him. It seems to do a lot more than just give him energy, and he said he has a person in the nearby desert village who brings it to him. 

And I get it, he is so busy you know? He manages three different farms, and has been talking about renting land in two more in nearby towns for more as well as renting for us a small apartment for city-trips, but he is barely sleeping, he barely seems to eat or drink anything that isn't coffee, and I haven't seen him in a few days, him saying he was on a journey for something ""special."" 

What should I do? The last time he stopped drinking coffee he struggled to do anything around the farm, and looked so tired. I can't help but make sure the coffee machine is filled for his mornings, but I am wanting him to be healthy and happy, if not just for me but for our kids.

# Importance of Choosing the Right Furniture for Beachfront Hotels

Beachfront hotels face unique challenges when it comes to furniture selection. Unlike regular hotels, beachfront hotels are exposed to salty air, high humidity, and strong winds. These environmental factors can damage furniture if it is not designed to withstand them.

The right furniture enhances the hotel’s aesthetics, increases guest satisfaction, and ensures long-lasting durability. Well-chosen furniture also improves functionality, making it easy for staff to maintain and rearrange as needed.

# Key Factors to Consider When Choosing Beachfront Hotel Furniture

When selecting furniture for a beachfront hotel, consider the following factors:

# 1. Weather Resistance

The coastal environment is harsh, with constant exposure to sun, salt, and moisture. Furniture must be made from materials that resist rust, corrosion, and fading. Look for weather-resistant options such as:

* **Teak wood** – Naturally resistant to moisture and insects
* **Aluminum** – Lightweight, rust-resistant, and easy to maintain
* **Resin wicker** – Durable, UV-resistant, and perfect for outdoor use
* **Stainless steel** – Strong and corrosion-resistant

# 2. Durability and Longevity

Beachfront hotel furniture is used daily by many guests, so it needs to be sturdy. Investing in high-quality materials ensures longevity and reduces the need for frequent replacements. Choose furniture designed for commercial use rather than residential use.

# 3. Comfort and Style

A beachfront hotel should provide maximum comfort to guests. Soft cushions, ergonomic designs, and breathable fabrics enhance relaxation. Additionally, the furniture style should match the hotel’s theme and overall ambiance.

# 4. Ease of Maintenance

Hotel staff should be able to clean and maintain furniture easily. Materials that require minimal upkeep, such as synthetic rattan and powder-coated aluminum, are ideal choices.

# 5. Eco-Friendliness

Sustainable furniture made from recycled or responsibly sourced materials is a great option. Many guests appreciate eco-friendly choices, and using such furniture can enhance the hotel’s reputation.

# Best Types of Furniture for Beachfront Hotels

# 1. Outdoor Seating and Lounge Chairs

Guests love to relax by the beach, so **hotel chairs** and lounge seating must be comfortable and stylish. Popular choices include:

* Sun loungers with adjustable reclining positions
* Hammocks and hanging chairs for a relaxing experience
* Daybeds with cushions for ultimate comfort
* Waterproof bean bags for a casual seating option

# 2. Poolside and Patio Furniture

Poolside areas need weather-resistant seating that can handle sun and moisture. Great options include:

* Chaise lounges with quick-dry cushions
* Outdoor sofas with UV-protected fabric
* Poolside tables with glass or aluminum tops

# 3. Dining Furniture for Beachfront Restaurants

A beachfront hotel usually has outdoor dining areas where guests enjoy meals with a sea view. The right dining furniture enhances the experience. Choose:

* **Aluminum or teak dining tables** – Durable and stylish
* **Resin or aluminum chairs** – Lightweight and weatherproof
* **Bar stools with marine-grade materials** for beach bars

# 4. Lobby and Reception Furniture

The lobby is the first impression of a hotel. Elegant yet durable furniture is a must. Consider:

* Plush sofas with removable, washable covers
* Coffee tables made from reclaimed wood or tempered glass
* Accent chairs that add a stylish touch

# 5. Guest Room Furniture

Beachfront hotel rooms should have furniture that complements the surroundings. Some good choices include:

* Wooden or wicker bed frames
* Lightweight wardrobes and dressers
* Balcony furniture like small chairs and tables

# 6. Outdoor Cabanas and Umbrellas

Guests need shaded areas to relax under the sun. Invest in:

* Cabanas with UV-resistant fabric
* Large beach umbrellas with sturdy bases

# How to Choose the Best Hotel Furniture Suppliers

Selecting the right **hotel furniture suppliers** is essential for quality and durability. Here are some tips to find the best suppliers:

# 1. Look for Experience in the Industry

A supplier with years of experience in hotel furniture understands the unique needs of beachfront properties.

# 2. Check Product Quality

Ask for samples or visit showrooms to check the durability, finish, and comfort of the furniture.

# 3. Customization Options

Some hotels prefer custom furniture to match their theme. Choose a supplier that offers customization in size, material, and color.

# 4. Read Customer Reviews

Check online reviews and testimonials to see what other hotel owners say about the supplier’s products and service.

# 5. Compare Prices

While quality is important, the furniture should also fit within the hotel’s budget. Compare prices from different suppliers to get the best deal.

# 6. Look for Warranty and After-Sales Service

Good suppliers offer warranties and after-sales support for repairs or replacements.

# Best Materials for Beachfront Hotel Furniture

Choosing the right materials ensures that the furniture lasts for years without damage. Here are some of the best materials for different types of furniture:

# 1. Wood

* **Teak:** Naturally resistant to moisture and insects
* **Acacia:** Strong and weather-resistant

# 2. Metal

* **Aluminum:** Rust-proof and lightweight
* **Stainless steel:** Durable but requires maintenance

# 3. Synthetic Materials

* **Resin wicker:** UV-resistant and easy to clean
* **HDPE plastic:** Recyclable and long-lasting

# 4. Fabrics

* **Sunbrella fabric:** Fade-resistant and waterproof
* **Quick-dry foam:** Perfect for outdoor cushions

# Maintenance Tips for Beachfront Hotel Furniture

Proper maintenance extends the life of the furniture. Here are some tips:

* **Clean regularly** – Wipe down furniture to remove salt and dust.
* **Use protective covers** – Covers protect furniture when not in use.
* **Store cushions indoors** – This prevents fading and mildew.
* **Apply protective coatings** – Use weather-resistant sealants on wood and metal.
* **Inspect for damage** – Regularly check for rust, cracks, or mold.

# Conclusion

Choosing the right furniture for a beachfront hotel is essential for durability, comfort, and style. Since coastal conditions can be harsh, selecting weather-resistant materials like teak, aluminum, and resin wicker ensures long-lasting furniture. Partnering with reliable **hotel furniture suppliers** helps maintain quality and aesthetics, enhancing the guest experience.

* Many cafés work with the same national roasters, so customers get **similar experiences everywhere**.
* Finding **truly unique coffees** means ordering from international roasters, but that comes with **high minimums, complex logistics, bureaucracy, and long wait times**.
* Ordering from multiple suppliers is **expensive and time-consuming**, making it hard to rotate offerings frequently.

So, I've been thinking about this idea and I'd like to hear your opinion:

* We **bring in coffee from top international roasters** and let cafés order **smaller quantities** without crazy minimums. Aggregating orders from multiple cafés helps us to get lower prices so the cafés get a really good price/kg.
* **No dealing with customs or international shipping**—we handle all of that.
* A **rotating selection of amazing roasters** so cafés can always offer something fresh and unique.

I think I complain nearly every time I write 

I don’t know what I’m doing anymore. Writing these notes to myself. Posting them, praying, you might see it. Deluding myself more. I wish it was as easy for me as it is for you. 

I keep listening to sad songs. And I don’t know if you’ll ever take my phone and skip the song I want you to hear so you can play a bunch for me again 😆 I liked that. There is so much I like about you. 

Here’s some of them in case we don’t get to do that again:

- Cat and Mouse - Red Jumpsuit Apparatus 

Learned this one on piano to play for you. I wish I could’ve.

- if you say so - Lea Michele 

- untitled - simple plan 

- lost in the cold - twiddle 

- I wouldn’t want to live if you didn’t love me - don williams 

- dust in the wind - Kansas 

- give you blue - Allen stone 

That one makes me extra sad. I wanted to be your blue. You were mine. But I think I ended up having the opposite effect. 

I wish we had played guilty gear together. Or guitar hero. I would’ve kicked your ass. 

I never finished the fallout show. I had it on my list of our shows to watch together. It feels wrong to watch it without you. We were going to watch the marvel stuff too. I really did want to understand the things you like :( 

You’d think with how constantly you’re on my mind, the things I want to remember the most wouldn’t be getting fuzzy in my memories. 

I’m scared I’m going to lose all my memories. I tried so hard to pay attention and remember it all. I made notes to help. But today I broke down on my lunch break. When I opened one of them I didn’t remember what it was about. It says “12 freckles” but I don’t remember where I counted 12 freckles on your skin or when I did. Just a couple months ago, if I had better drawing skills I would’ve been able to draw your iris patterns from memory. Now I find myself second guessing myself when I want to remember. I loved looking at your eyes :( 

I haven’t forgotten everything though. I can still hear your voice. All of your voices. The sweet tone you have when you were trying to make me feel better, back in the beginning. The way your voice sounds when I’m crying now. It’s like you want to be sweet and make me feel better but it’s forced, like you’re hiding being irritated. I don’t like it but I remember the way your voice sounds when you’re irritated. I do like remembering your voice when you’d tell me to do something and how you were so patient you’d still sound same if I was whining and you’d already said it 8 times. I guess it’s a good thing I marked this NSFW, huh? I liked the way your voice sounded when you took a big drink of the coffee I made you. Or the cheesecake pie thing. I consider myself to be so lucky to remember how your voice sounds when you’re sleepy. It’s my favorite. You’re so cuddly when you sleep too. You make me feel more than wanted the way you hold me when you’re asleep. 

I remember the way your skin feels when you let me run my fingers over it. I remember the way the muscles on your back felt on my fingers when I was holding so tight like you’d fly away if I didn’t. I never had to fake anything with you. Except being okay with you leaving, knowing you were only going because you wanted space from me so I’d lose feelings. One of my favorite memories is how your hair felt when I had my fingers running through it. And the time you let me wash and condition it when we were in the shower. I remember it so well. It was when i wasn’t afraid to touch you. Or kiss you. I feel like I can’t now. But god were those showers amazing. Even when I was getting water trapped in my ears because we were just standing in the warm water kissing 🥰 

I told you I think about you a lot. My world isn’t right anymore without you. I’m cold and afraid. It’s a fight to make myself do anything now. Not because I can’t, but it feels pointless to now. I can’t tell you good morning and I hope you have a good day. So why would I feel like I even need to get up? I can’t make extra food at every meal in case you come over. So I don’t even feel like there’s a point in cooking or eating. I wish I didn’t know the last time you said goodnight and sent me a message with goodnight kisses. I loved those. I don’t see the point in sleeping anymore. Most of the time it’s just passing out from exhaustion after a couple days. 

I don’t know what you do to me - I was so independent and confident. You being my purpose and motivation just came so naturally. I wanted to share everything with you. I don’t dislike myself or anything. I just feel like I have no reason to do anything if my only reason for doing it is myself. Even laughing feels like I’m betraying you because I can’t send you funny videos anymore. 

Life is hard but loving you was easy. I enjoyed pouring my love into you more than anything I’ve ever enjoyed. I didn’t even need you to love me back. I wish I could still love you without guilt. I can’t even text you without feeling guilty. I’d sell my soul to have an hour of the time we had before again. 

I never expected to be remembered by anyone. A legacy is something for people who aren’t this avoidant of the general public. But you have a piece of me with you now. I know it’s not something you want, and if I could have it back I may want to continue on with this fight. But when it does finally take me away, I know my legacy will be the piece of me that you get to keep. So I do think that’s pretty cool. 

I am grateful to have been known by someone while I was here though. I wish I could take your pain with me to show my appreciation. I’d take it all from you now if I could, even the stuff you’ve never shared or healed from. I wish I could steal every burden you have away and give your soul peace. 

Btw if you ever want a sign that I’m with you when I’m gone- you’ll find me as a carpenter bee. 🐝 soaking up the sun in the summer, I just know it. When you see one of those loud fuckers, promise me you’ll think of me? 

.

.

I guess this last part is just me venting. Not really to you but stuff I need to get out.

Sometimes I want to just scream at the universe. I’m not a bad person. But karma is so specifically cruel with the way it tortures me. Every single thing I have ever prayed for has been given to me with a twist - like my prayers were answered by a genie. 

I prayed for a chance to be a better mother than I had. It’s almost ironic to even call her that. He only lived for 6 minutes. 

I prayed for a scholarship when I was in high school. I was bouncing from foster home to foster home and working two jobs just to be able to eat consistently. I got a full ride, they even paid for my books and dorm. I didn’t lose this one because of the universe, but my own bad decisions. 

Even though they told me I had almost no chance at ever being able to carry a child to term again, I prayed so hard for a normal life. I wanted to get married and have a child. Not even a kardashian marriage was as short as the one I had to that fucking monster. The second half of what I prayed for… well I guess you’d have seen them by now if they were still here but I still don’t know if I can talk about it without feeling suicidal. Her name was going to be Emma Grace. I wish I had at least gotten to meet her like I did when my son was born. 

There’s so much more, especially small stuff, but I have to stop or I won’t be able to stop the spiral. 

It wasn’t all praying either. I did a lot of work. Years of therapy, growth, self help and healing. Faith and consistency. I poured years into finding peace with myself and my life. I learned what makes me happy and how to be alone. I learned how to love and be grateful in any situation. How to change the way I thought. What values I found be most important. 

I volunteered my time, sacrificed my energy, gave from my plate when I didn’t have enough to eat myself. I always believed in being someone you’d want to date. So I worked to become someone I’d crash out over. Absolute obsession. 

Life has taken to proving it was only wasted time in the face of an indiscriminate illness. 

It’s so unfair. 

And all that work I did stopped me from even being able to resent what’s happened to me. Or anything for that matter. I can’t wake up and be anything but grateful for the sun that shines on my face. I can’t cry without a tear falling reminding me of the wonderous complexity of the human body. 

I don’t even resent that bitch in Arkansas and I refuse to call her anything other than Lilith because of how truly evil she is. I can’t even resent someone like her, an enemy of humanity. 

Karmas a bitch. I didn’t earn this karma, and the bitch is still winning. She’s gonna take the trophy in the end too, because god knows when it’s over I’ll walk into the light in awe of what’s to come. Until then, I’m damned to the pain and heartbreak. ",1,1740214521.0,LettersAnswered,2,1.0,False

I am also in a relationship with call her Angel 45 female for almost 7 years. Steve and the kids are aware of Angel and she is a part of our family. Her and Steve are not in a relationship together. 
I have been growing apart from Steve for about 10 years now, but i still love him. Angel is very much my everything as a partner. She is always there for me and ready for all the chaos I know I bring. Steve is more and more distant especially in the last 6 months. He spends all his time alone in the basement or buried in his phone. With some help from my kids, I have found out that he is using snapchat to digitally mess around with over 100 girls. Spicy photos and videos and chat. I feel cheated on. He is lying to me, right? This is not what polygamous is all about. He is being sneaky, lying to me about what he is doing and probably lying to those girls too. 
For more back ground, Steve became a stay at home parent 15 years ago when my dad got sick and I was taking care of him. Since then I have worked my tail off to provide for him and the kids. I have literally paid for everything from bills to groceries to vacation. It all fell to me despite me asking for help in more recent years. The kids don't need someone at home. Along with the kids he was also doing dishes, laundry and cooking. As the kids have gotten older they help with family laundry, not just their own, they do dishes, clean the bathroom and kitchen ... he is overall doing less and less around the house but i still pay for everything including his cigarettes and weed. I also own the house we live in as it was inheritance from my grandmother. 
Here is where I may be the ass hole. I am planning on ending things with him and telling him to get out. I am going to give him 3 months to find an apartment and job and get out. I plan to give him the couch and a coffee table along with everything he would for the kitchen and bathroom. I will not give him a share of the house though. It is mine, he may have help with things around the house but i have paid for everything.
He was the kind of guy that would go on about hating people that lie and how important trust is and that it needs to be earned. He has broken my trust and I am done with him. I plan to move Angel in with the kids and I as soon as he is gone. I have already proposed to her and she said yes.

# Why Food Quality Matters on Keto

The ketogenic diet is more than just cutting carbs—it’s about choosing the right foods to fuel fat-burning and optimize overall health. High-quality keto-friendly foods provide essential nutrients, keep cravings at bay, and accelerate weight loss by keeping your body in ketosis. If you’re struggling to shed pounds or maximize fat burning, focusing on nutrient-dense, low-carb foods is the key to success.

In this article, we’ll explore the 10 best keto-friendly foods that will help you lose weight faster and burn fat more efficiently. Plus, we’ll show you how to incorporate them into your meals for maximum results.

# Top 10 Keto-Friendly Foods for Rapid Fat Loss

# 1. Avocados

Avocados are a keto superfood packed with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, fiber, and essential micronutrients like potassium. They help keep you full, support healthy digestion, and provide steady energy without spiking insulin levels.

✅ **How to Eat**: Add sliced avocado to salads, blend it into keto smoothies, or use it as a creamy base for guacamole.

# 2. Eggs

Eggs are one of the most nutrient-dense keto staples, providing high-quality protein, healthy fats, and important vitamins such as B12 and choline. They promote satiety and help with muscle maintenance while keeping your carb intake low.

✅ **How to Eat**: Enjoy eggs scrambled, fried, poached, or boiled. Try making keto-friendly egg muffins for a quick grab-and-go breakfast.

# 3. Salmon and Fatty Fish

Wild-caught salmon, mackerel, and sardines are loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation, improve brain function, and boost fat loss. These fish are also excellent sources of high-quality protein.

✅ **How to Eat**: Grill or bake salmon, make keto sushi rolls, or toss sardines into a salad for an extra omega-3 boost.

# 4. Grass-Fed Beef

Grass-fed beef is rich in healthy fats, protein, and essential nutrients like iron and zinc. Unlike conventional beef, grass-fed varieties contain higher levels of omega-3s and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which may aid in fat loss.

✅ **How to Eat**: Make keto-friendly burgers, steak salads, or slow-cooked beef stews.

# 5. Coconut Oil & MCT Oil

Coconut oil and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil are excellent sources of quick-digesting fats that boost energy and promote ketosis. MCT oil, in particular, is converted directly into ketones, helping your body burn fat more efficiently.

✅ **How to Eat**: Add MCT oil to coffee (keto bulletproof coffee), use coconut oil for cooking, or drizzle it over roasted vegetables.

# 6. Leafy Greens

Spinach, kale, and arugula are nutrient powerhouses that provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber without adding unnecessary carbs. These greens support digestion, help regulate blood sugar, and provide antioxidants to fight inflammation.

✅ **How to Eat**: Make keto salads, sauté spinach in butter, or blend greens into a smoothie with coconut milk.

# 7. Cheese & Full-Fat Dairy

Cheese, heavy cream, and full-fat yogurt are excellent keto-friendly sources of fat and protein. They also contain beneficial probiotics that support gut health. However, be mindful of portion sizes, as some dairy products contain hidden carbs.

✅ **How to Eat**: Use cheese in keto casseroles, enjoy heavy cream in coffee, or make keto-friendly cheese crisps.

# 8. Nuts & Seeds

Almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds are fantastic sources of healthy fats, fiber, and protein. They help keep you full and provide sustained energy throughout the day.

✅ **How to Eat**: Snack on a handful of nuts, make chia seed pudding or sprinkle flaxseeds over salads.

# 9. Olive Oil

Extra virgin olive oil is a staple in the Mediterranean diet and an excellent keto-friendly fat source. It contains powerful antioxidants and monounsaturated fats that support heart health and aid in fat-burning.

✅ **How to Eat**: Drizzle olive oil over salads, use it as a base for homemade keto dressings, or cook with it at low temperatures.

# 10. Bone Broth

Bone broth is rich in collagen, amino acids, and essential minerals that support gut health, reduce inflammation, and improve skin elasticity. It’s also great for replenishing electrolytes, which is especially important when following keto.

✅ **How to Eat**: Sip bone broth as a warm beverage, use it as a base for soups, or incorporate it into keto meal prep.

# How to Incorporate These Foods Into Your Daily Meals

Now that you know the top keto-friendly foods, it’s time to create meals that maximize fat-burning and keep you in ketosis.

* **Breakfast:** Scrambled eggs with avocado and a side of spinach sautéed in coconut oil.
* **Lunch:** Grilled salmon on a bed of leafy greens, drizzled with olive oil and lemon.
* **Dinner:** Grass-fed steak with roasted Brussels sprouts and a side of bone broth.
* **Snacks:** A handful of macadamia nuts, cheese slices, or chia seed pudding.

By prioritizing these high-quality foods, you can accelerate your weight loss and experience the full benefits of a keto lifestyle.

# The Importance of Meal Planning for Long-Term Success

One of the biggest reasons people struggle with keto is not having a plan. When you don’t prepare your meals in advance, you’re more likely to make poor food choices or fall off track.

A structured meal plan removes the guesswork, ensuring you eat the right foods in the right amounts for optimal fat loss. Whether you’re new to keto or looking to fine-tune your diet, having a well-balanced meal plan can make all the difference.

1ivee8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ivee8z/ro_the_story_that_made_her_belive/,[RO] The story that made her belive,"The weather was pleasant, with a soft breeze carrying the scent of rain. The sky, painted in shades of gray, hinted at a light drizzle soon.

Aanya sat in a cozy corner of the café, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and warm pastries wrapping around her like a familiar comfort.

""Love doesn’t exist. People just get attracted to each other for a while,"" she muttered, her gaze fixed on a couple at the next table.

The girl giggled as the guy leaned in, whispering something that made her eyes sparkle. They looked lost in their own little world, oblivious to everything else.

Aanya rolled her eyes. How long before one of them loses interest? A week? A month?

She had seen it all—sweet words turning bitter, promises breaking, feelings fading. In a world where people swiped left and right like love was just another game, how could anyone believe in forever?

She sighed, stirring her coffee absentmindedly, ready to brush the thought away. But just then, a deep, steady voice interrupted her.

""So, you don’t believe in love?""

Aanya turned her head, slightly startled.

An old man sat at the table next to hers, holding a cup of chai. His hair was silver, neatly combed back, and faint wrinkles lined his face. He looked like someone who had lived through decades of stories, yet there was an easy calmness about him, as if he had figured out something the rest of the world hadn’t.

He glanced at her with a small smile. “So, you don’t believe in love?”

Aanya sighed, stirring her coffee. “No, I don’t.”

""And why is that?"" he asked, his tone curious rather than challenging.

""Because love is just a temporary feeling,"" she said, folding her arms. ""People get attached, they think it’s forever, and then one day, they move on like it meant nothing.""

The old man nodded slowly, taking a sip of his tea. ""Sounds like you've seen a lot of heartbreak.""

Aanya scoffed. ""I've seen reality. Love is just an excuse people use to feel special. And when the excitement wears off, they leave. That’s how it works now.""

The man chuckled softly. ""You sound like someone who has never been in love.""

""Because I haven’t. And I don’t plan to,"" she said firmly.

The old man chuckled, shaking his head. ""You sound like someone who’s only seen love from the outside.""

""And you sound like someone who believes in fairy tales,"" she countered.

He leaned forward slightly, resting his elbows on the table. ""Or maybe, just maybe, I’ve seen the kind of love that doesn’t end.""

Aanya smirked, crossing her arms. ""Alright then,"" she said, leaning back. ""Go ahead. Change my mind.""

The old man set his cup down gently, his fingers resting on the rim for a moment, as if touching something far away. His eyes softened, lost in a time long gone.

And then, with a voice heavy with nostalgia, he began—


1990, Kolkata.

The air was thick with the scent of old books, the hum of street vendors, and the occasional whistle of a distant train. The city moved in its usual rhythm, but for me, life had felt painfully still.

I was a struggling photographer, finding beauty in unnoticed things—raindrops sliding off windowpanes, wrinkled hands counting coins at tea stalls, the golden light of the setting sun casting long shadows on Howrah Bridge. But despite capturing so many fleeting moments, I had never found one that truly belonged to me.

Until her.

The first time I saw her, it was at the railway station. She was sitting on a bench, engrossed in a book, her fingers absentmindedly tracing the edges of the pages. Her long hair was loosely tied, strands escaping and dancing with the wind. She looked up briefly, and for a second, our eyes met.

It was nothing. A moment. A passing glance. But some moments don’t fade—they stay.

A few weeks later, I saw her again—this time at a small record shop. She was listening to an old Kishore Kumar song, tapping her fingers on the wooden counter in rhythm. I wanted to say something, anything, but words failed me.

And then, just as suddenly as she had appeared, she was gone.

This became a pattern.

She was always there—in places I least expected, yet never long enough for me to speak to her.
At a café, blowing on her steaming tea.
At an old bookstore, flipping through pages with the kind of reverence I had only seen in poets.
Walking past me in a busy street, her laughter ringing like wind chimes.

She was like a photograph that never developed fully—always close, never clear enough to keep.

But things changed on a rainy evening.

I was at the station, my camera slung over my shoulder, waiting for a train I wasn’t sure I wanted to take. And then—there she was.

She stood a few feet away, under the dim yellow station lights, her hands clutching a small notebook. This time, she wasn’t reading. She was just standing there, lost in thought.

I took a deep breath and finally walked up to her.

""Do you always appear like a scene in an old movie?"" I asked, my voice more confident than I felt.

She turned, surprised, and then—she smiled.

""You always notice?"" she teased.

I chuckled. ""You’re kind of hard to miss.""

She looked down at her notebook and then back at me. ""Maybe I was waiting to be noticed.""

There it was.

The click of a moment that wasn’t just fleeting—but meant to last.

That night, we sat on an empty train and talked about everything—favorite songs, childhood memories, the kind of love letters we wished someone had written for us. And when the train finally stopped at the last station, neither of us wanted to leave.

Because love isn’t about finding someone who fits a checklist. It isn’t about perfect timing or grand confessions.

It’s about the small moments—the quiet glances, the shared songs, the rain-soaked train rides where two people realize they don’t want to walk away anymore.

And so, we didn’t.


The old man paused, taking a slow sip of his now-cold tea.

Aanya sat in silence, staring at him. Something about the way he spoke, the way he had lived that story, made it feel real—made love feel real.

She looked out the window. The couple from earlier was still there, lost in their little world. And for the first time, Aanya didn’t roll her eyes.

She turned back to the old man. ""What happened next?""

He smiled, his gaze distant. ""I married her.""

Aanya didn’t speak for a moment. Then, almost whispering, she asked—

""Do you still love her?""

The old man’s smile deepened, his eyes soft with memories.

""Every single day.""

And in that moment, something in Aanya shifted.

Because love wasn’t just about passion—it was about presence. It was about staying, even when the world told you to move on.

Maybe love was real. Maybe forever did exist.

And maybe, just maybe, she had been wrong all along.

It’s 6 AM now and I awake to the sounds of the Reunification Express’ chugging along railroad tracks. Our tour provider provided us with VIP carriages on the Lotus Express which is quite comfy barring the sounds of the train and railway. The cabin was a private berth with 4 beds in it shared with 3 other members of the tour group. I’m thankful we were booked with Lotus after reading the unpleasant stories online about the regular Vietnam rail. We were provided with working A/C, WiFi, complimentary coffee and snacks and wet tissue. Last but not least, our cabin had a big window looking out into the passing landscape. 



At around 8 AM, the landscape outside starts to dazzle, the views turn from farmlands to coastal sceneries. We’re now passing through the spectacular Hai Van Pass, believed to offer the most beautiful coastal views in all of Vietnam. The glistening ocean, the cliffs and the lush coastlines all combine for a visual treat. Our cabin is in awe for the 20 or so minute show. This was certainly the coolest part of the journey. Traveling by train is quite different from the bus and the plane. I thought it felt more personal and old-school in a way while also being a lot closer to the scenery. Would I ever do it again? Probably.



A few hours later, we finally arrived at Da Nang. After checking in to our hotels, the group heads out to My Khe beach. Highly regarded to be one of the best beaches in all of Vietnam. The white sand beach and its coastline is long, wide and spacious. The tour guide took us further down the coastline where we almost had the beach to ourselves. The group also had the option to go snorkeling in the area. The few members that did, remarked there wasn’t much to be seen unfortunately except small silverfish.



After a late lunch, it was now time to head off to Marble Mountains. It’s a cluster of 5 mountains only a short drive away from the city. Each mountain has their own attributes and name to them like Fire, Earth, Metal, Wood or Water mountain. Some housed buddhist shrines or statues, while others housed caves. Summiting these mini mountains garnered impressive panoramic views of Da Nang and the surrounding areas. Before leaving we got to enjoy sunset views while up top of Water mountain.



In the evening, our bus took us right by the dragon bridge in the heart of Da Nang. The famous bridge, lit up at night, has a display of fire and water breathing. Instead of looking for the perfect viewing spot on the street. Our tour provider reserved us seats at a nearby restaurant, Dragon Ball Rooftop. The views were great here and although it lasted only 5 minutes, it was a pretty cool display. 



After dinner, the group decided to burn a bit of calories and walk along Bach Dang St running parallel to the riverside. We were able to admire the bridge lights and Da Nang skyline before making our way to Son Tra Night Market. We were inundated with a selection of seafood, desserts, snacks and souvenirs to indulge in. I myself went for some spring rolls and some snails, che dessert for late night snacks. With our stomachs full, the group head back to their hotels for a restful night before our trip to Hoi An tomorrow.

1iveasv,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwhocirclejerk/comments/1iveasv/this_underrated_episode_that_is_better_than/,This underrated episode that is better than Heaven Sent or Blink will save Doctor Who! I hope the BBC see this and make it a reality. And sack RTD.,"The 15th Doctor was crying, ""I'm sorry babes, I did not mean to use those stale beans. I should have replaced the beans. I ruined your coffee!"" Ruby gave the Doctor a sympathetic smile, ""Well, it's not too bad."" ""No, no. no, I should have known. I really should have known. Bad coffee, that's the worst"" the Doctor continued, tears streaming down his face, leaving a small puddle at his feet..

""Well, how bout we go to another transracial Radical Marxist pride parade in Neo-California, that always cheers you up"", ""Oh... babes, babes! you just read my mind"" said the Doctor, as the tears stopped, and he jumped around the Tardis console flicking switches. ""I am gonna totally wear my gayest most flamboyant outfit to this party. Trust me Rubes, it'll be fantastic.""

.....

Ruby, and Belinda held onto the dying doctor, dragging him back to the Tardis after a horrible battle with Fenric, tears streaming down his face.

""Oh my god, whats happening,"" cried Ruby. ""You know what I said about changing faces, regenerating, I'm regenerating babes. Its time""

""You see Ruby, there's always a twist at the end"" the 15th Doctor continued, as a final tear drops down his cheek. Golden energy fulling engulfing him as he regenerates.

Golden energy fading away fading away, revealing a familiar older face with messy spiky brown hair.

The man moved his tongue across his teeth. ""I know these teeth..."" he continued, as Ruby and Belinda stared in shock. He turned to the women, ""Oh, hello, I know you. It's me. New me... or rather old me... again. Anyway... lets go, Allon' y!""

The Doctor continued having adventures written by RTD, now 90 percent more Marxist and woke.

Suddenly, the 12th Doctor woke up in the Tardis.

""Oh, Thank God! It was all just a dream!"" he yelled, ""I'm still me..."".

He looked down at his hand, it was glowing.

""Must've been a pre-regenerative nightmare. Funny little thing nightmares are, pieces of the unconscious mind trying to warn the conscious mind of deeply held anxieties, trauma or even... potential danger. So, what must I be afraid of. What danger is impending.""

Suddenly, the Closter Bells in the Tardis rang, as the entire console room glowed a bright red.

""Oh no, not now. What's a man gotta do to die in peace"" the Doctor frowned.

The Tardis materialized on a planet, a dead planet.

There were people, millions of people held in millions of pods. All across the planet, held in some sort of status.

The Doctor stared; his expression perplexed as he stared into one of the pods, ""Hang on a moment... whats happened to your face. It's sorta squishy... it's not a face at all. Oh... I know what this is. Dream Crabs!""

""So.. you understand"" said a voice.

The Doctor gripped his hand ""Yes.""

""Good.. you know. I've been waiting for centuries for this moment doctor. For you to die, you are very stubborn in that regard"" 

""As are you"" the Doctor turned, staring to the man behind him.

""I must say, I didn't expect my existential crisis to take on such a... literal form..."" the Doctor said, as his doppelganger smiled. 

""Oh, come now. There's no need for dramatics. You know who I am. The man you despise the most in the universe. But I have grown.""

The man switched his appearence, now looking like Hugh Laurie.

""I have stopped you so many times. And I'm going to stop you this time too. You can change your name, call yourself an entire assortment of stupid names such as the Valeyard or the Dream Lord. Cast all kinds of scary dreams in my head. But you don't intimidate me, you're just a twisted reflection of myself, a shadow of my darkest impulses with pudding for brains. So why don't you do the smart thing and run away while you can""

""No, those were not just dreams. Those were your future. You took away my chance of gaining your regenerations. You stole from your future self. So, now I'm gonna ruin you, Doc-tor, with a future of wokeness and DEI-hires and leftist marxist episodes like Kerblam. You see, these are no any ordinary victims of Dream Crabs. They are woke gay DEI hires, I am abzorbing their woke dreams, well I will make your reality""

""NO! You cannot do that to us! I will make sure that day never comes. I'll fight you, and everything you stand for... to my last breath""

""Then it's a good thing, you're dying. My condolences. But, when you do die. Doctor. I'm gonna turn you into a woman, and you will be woke and badly written. You see Doctor, I have gained myself something far more impressive than more regenerations. That House infected your ship, but you set the Tardis Matrix free, dispelling the entity. Or so you thought. I consumed... deVOURed House. And now... I am Doctor House. And with my powers of godhood, I shall force the great showrunner into regenerating into Chris Chibnall. So he may rewrite your story, and turn you into a woman. I have already lobotomized RTD, and now he is under my command""

Suddenly, shots were fired at the Hugh Laurie Dr House Dreamlord Valeyard, and he vanished into thin air.

It was... Philip Morris.

""Hi, its me. Philip Morris, the super cool person who found The Enemy of the World, The Web of Fear from Nigeria.""

""You saved me... but that day is still yet to come I'm afraid. Chibnall is going to takeover as writer of this universe, and I'll be a woman, and a timeless child, and possibly worse.""

""That is why... you need to take this. To fight the narcissists who are as self-absorbed and repellant and were only ever destined to create total and utter woke carnage"" said Philip Morris, handing the Doctor his Sonic Glock. 

""Thank you.. my friend"" replied the Doctor, holding the Glock tightly in his hands. He looked over to the Tardis, ""Its time"".

Bill, Clara, and Nardole stood by the Tardis, as the Doctor acknowledged their presence. Looking back at his former companions for one last time. Before disappearing into the blue box.

The Doctor was in his TARDIS and he was starting to regenerate, from is twelfth Doctor to his thirteenth Doctor (not counting the war one or anything like that).

The Doctor said - You wait a moment, Doctor. Let's get it right. I've got a few things to say to you. Basic stuff first. Never be cruel, never be cowardly, and never, ever eat pears or anything vegan! Remember, hate is always foolish and love is always wise. Always try to be nice, but never fail to defeat your enemeis. Oh, and you mustn't tell anyone your name. No one would understand it, anyway. Except, ah! (collapses) Except other time lords. Other time lords can hear it sometimes. Because they're from your species. Aaah! But nobody else. Nobody else, ever. Laugh hard, run fast, be kind, and kill Daleks. Doctor, I let you go now.

(The regeneration streams out of him, causing TARDIS stuff to explode. When it ends, the engines are stuttering, and the signet ring falls off the Doctor's right hand. In fact, all the clothes are rather baggy on this new body. The scanner reveals the reflection of the new, younger face with jaw-length blonde hair.)

DOCTOR 13 said - Oh, that's fucking brilliant!

(The accent has moved southwards, from Scotland to a part of the UK that people actually care about, like London or somehtinh.)

DOCTOR 13 said - I'M STILL A MAN!

(The Doctor presses a button, there's a small explosion in the console and the scanner proclaims - Systems Crisis MULTIPLE OPERATIONS FAILURES. The Tardis snaps back into normal space, tilts drastically and keeps exploding and shir. The cloister bell continues to toll, and the Doctor is who the cloister bell tolls for. The Doctor tries to hang on to the console, but loses his grip and slides towards the door which is now open with papers flying out of it. Now the Tardis is completely on its side, door open downwards. The Time Rotor explodes and then the Doctor whips out his trusty sonic screwdriver, and uses it to suddenly fix the Time Rotor. Everything is quiet, as he nonscelantly walks up the console, and begins to travel off on his adventures.)

DOCTOR 13 said - Easy to fix when you know how, good thing I'm a guy and have knowledge about how vehicles work.

Later on Earth, Ryan was on his Youtube shcanel.
Ryan said - So today I want to talk about the greatest man I ever met. Smart, funny, tough, badass. Proper badass. Er, where do I start?

1iveag1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1iveag1/the_day_the_earth_shattered/,The Day the Earth Shattered,"The sky turned red at 9:42 a.m.

I was on Fifth Avenue, coffee in hand, when the first ripple of sound reached us. It wasn’t a boom or a crash—it was a low, gut-deep vibration that made the air feel too thick to breathe. People stopped, looking around like confused animals before a storm. Then the ground trembled. Windows rattled. The coffee shop behind me spilled customers into the street.

Nobody knew what had happened. Phones buzzed with emergency alerts, but they were vague: GLOBAL IMPACT EVENT—SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. Some people ran. Some stood frozen, staring up at the sky like answers might be written there. But there was nothing—just that red haze deepening across the clouds, turning the sun into a dull, bloody smudge.

A woman next to me clutched my arm. “Is it— Is it war?” she asked, her voice trembling. I had no answer.

Minutes later, the first shockwave hit.

I didn’t hear it so much as feel it—like the Earth itself had been struck with a hammer. Every car alarm in the city screamed at once. Glass exploded from windows in a shimmering rain. People fell to their knees, clutching their ears. My coffee slipped from my hand as I stumbled back against a taxi. Somewhere, a building groaned like a living thing, steel and concrete protesting the strain.

I didn’t know it then, but halfway across the world, an asteroid the size of Alaska had plunged into the heart of the Indian Ocean. The impact released energy equivalent to tens of billions of nuclear bombs, vaporizing millions of gallons of water and punching a hole through the Earth’s crust. A column of steam, molten rock, and debris shot into the sky, breaching the stratosphere and darkening the sun within minutes.

The shockwave traveled through the Earth’s mantle, triggering earthquakes that shattered cities from Mumbai to Perth. Entire islands vanished beneath walls of water as tsunamis surged outward, racing faster than jet planes. Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives—gone within hours. The waves hit the coasts of Africa and Australia next, flooding entire nations before barreling across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

In New York, thousands of miles from ground zero, we felt the Earth shudder beneath our feet. The Hudson River surged beyond its banks, flooding lower Manhattan with icy water and dragging cars and debris through the streets. Bridges groaned under the strain, and the Statue of Liberty vanished behind walls of mist and rain.

The moment the first shockwave passed, the streets of New York became chaos. People screamed and ran in every direction, cars collided as drivers panicked, and glass from shattered windows crunched beneath my shoes as I stumbled forward. My heart pounded so hard I could hear it in my ears.

I didn’t think—I just moved. Adrenaline carried me through the crowd as if my body had decided to survive before my mind could catch up. Sirens blared from every direction, but their wails blended into the background noise of panic. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, another emergency alert flashing across the screen: SHELTER IN PLACE. AVOID EXPOSURE. TAKE COVER IMMEDIATELY.

I remember turning onto a side street to avoid the mass of people flooding Fifth Avenue. The pavement beneath my feet trembled with aftershocks, and somewhere in the distance, a building collapsed with a sound like thunder. Dust and smoke hung in the air, making it hard to breathe.

When I finally reached my apartment building—seven blocks away—it was as if my legs gave out all at once. My breath came in ragged gasps as I fumbled with my keys, hands shaking too hard to grip them properly. Behind me, the distant roar of the Hudson River swelling over its banks echoed through the air.

I shoved the door open and staggered inside, slamming it shut behind me as if that thin piece of wood could keep the world out. The stairwell was dark—the power had already gone out—and I had to climb six flights of stairs by the faint glow of my phone’s flashlight. Every step echoed like a countdown, each breath fogging the air as the building’s temperature dropped.

When I finally reached my apartment and locked the door behind me, I stood in the silence and let the weight of everything hit me all at once. My pulse pounded in my ears, and my hands wouldn’t stop shaking. Outside the window, the city burned beneath a sky that no longer belonged to us.

And that’s when I realized: the world as we knew it had ended.

But I was still here.

Then rain came as I watched from my window. Thick and black, carrying ash and pulverized rock from halfway across the world.

By nightfall, the fires had begun.

Molten debris, hurled into space by the impact, rained down across the globe like falling stars. Forests ignited from Siberia to the Amazon. Cities burned as flaming stones crashed through rooftops and shattered glass towers. Smoke and ash choked the skies, blotting out the moon and turning night into a suffocating, endless twilight.

The days that followed were a blur of fear and desperation. The air grew colder as the sun disappeared behind a veil of dust and soot. Crops withered in the fields, and animals starved or suffocated as the world entered a nuclear winter. Cities fell silent as their people fled—or died. Governments collapsed. Communications failed.

By the third week, New York had become a city of shadows. The streets were filled with abandoned cars and the distant echoes of footsteps that never seemed to come close. Fires burned unchecked, their smoke mixing with the ever-present ash that fell from the sky.

Somewhere in the distance, the Hudson River continued to rise, fed by storms that never seemed to end. The air smelled of salt and decay, and each breath burned my throat.

I rationed what food I had, conserving cans of soup and crackers like they were gold. Water was harder to come by—the taps had stopped running within days, and the bottled supply in my apartment wouldn’t last forever. I collected rainwater when I could, filtering it through makeshift cloth screens to catch the ash and grit that fell from the sky.

Nights were the worst. Without power, the world outside my window became a void of blackness, broken only by the distant flicker of fires still smoldering in the city’s ruins. The silence was so deep it felt alive—broken only by the occasional distant crack of collapsing buildings or the howling wind that carried the distant echoes of sirens and screams.

I slept in fits and starts, huddled beneath blankets and coats as the temperature inside the apartment plummeted. The cold seeped into my bones, and I woke each morning with frost clinging to the glass and the ache of hunger gnawing at my stomach.

Still, I held on.

It’s been a year now.

New York is a city of ghosts. Most of its people are gone—lost to hunger, sickness, or the long, silent sleep that comes when the cold becomes too much to bear. Those of us who remain live like shadows, scavenging through the frozen ruins, our breath fogging the air as we huddle against the endless night.

The fires have long since burned out, leaving only blackened shells of buildings and streets choked with ash and debris. Snow falls year-round now—grey and heavy, carrying the taste of smoke and iron. The air is thin, and each breath feels like pulling ice into my lungs.

I’ve stopped keeping track of the days. The sun still rises somewhere beyond the clouds, but its light is weak and distant, casting only a faint, dim glow that barely touches the earth.

Sometimes, when the clouds break, I look up at the sky and wonder if anyone else is still out there—or if we’re all just waiting for the last ember of humanity to flicker out.

I don’t know how this ends.

But when it does, I hope the Earth remembers us not for how we died—
But for how long we tried to hold on.",2,1740213193.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone. I am hoping  am a 38F who smokes cigarettes but is sober from everything else (for four years). I have endometriosis and chronic depression. I take 54mg Concerta for ADHD,  4mg Suboxone (tapering down), and 300 mg of Zoloft daily. I'm very regular and strict with my meds. Never miss them. I'm not tiny but I am not overweight. My job is very physical so I am pretty strong and in shape despite the cigarettes 

I have been experiencing extreme fatigue for the past few months. I thought it was because I was working two jobs, but I switched to one job (landscaping) and it's still not good. Coffee, Concerta and Cigarettes help only a bit. I have noticed that drinking a sugar free red bull or other stronger energy drinks only work for a few hours. I can still fall asleep after drinking one of I want to, it just keeps me from accidentally falling asleep.

Today I had an early day so I got back to my house around 12. I fell asleep at 3pm and slept until 1am. I got up but I am still absolutely exhausted and could easily go back to sleep now. I have a day or two like this every single week. I feel like I HAVE to sleep 16-18 hours one or two days a week to function. I am hoping you all can help me! I have a family history of ovarian cancer. And it always concerns me when something changes health-wise. 

 Both of my illnesses cause fatigue so when I go to the doctor they usually won't look for other causes. But the severity is increasing. I used to be able to fight it more. Now it's really affecting my life and my job. Any advice is greatly appreciated!! What do I tell the doctors? Any vocab that will help communicate better about this?

Our relationship was great for about the first year and then for the last four months we had a lot of fights that never got resolved properly and truthfully I feel like it always ended with me sobbing and apologizing. I got a lot of relationship advice from my sister who is married because to me it was better  to get an opinion from a married woman than from my dad (for context my mom died when I was younger ). I know that there were times that I seriously dropped the ball as a boyfriend and was straight up neglectful to her, I also had felt that she had done the same things to me and when I confronted her about I felt like she never really apologized or acknowledge the things she did. I always made a point to apologize and acknowledge when I made mistakes.

Its been ten months since we broke up and things have gotten better but I still have these feelings that I fucked everything up because I have a insecurities that make me act stupid. I am also a chronic overthinker. After that relationship ended, I got coffee with her mom a few times (she had kind of also been like a mom to me) I would just complain about all the things her daughter did and how I felt because I was worried her daughter would demonize me to her mother (my ex did this with her friends quite often). She at one point told me that maybe I was just too good for her daughter. I don't know if she said that because she meant it or if she just got tired of me complaining. I did always feel like I tried harder especially considering I had a job and she didn't and I had more responsibility because of it being just my dad and I at out house. Her mom recommended I go to grief counseling since I never did after losing my mom but after 3 sessions I realized my insecurities weren't based in any grief, more just that they were based on the period of life I am in. So I just talked to my sister and family and friends about in constantly. They all told me that my ex was not nice to me and I had a right to be upset about things she did but I always played devil's advocate to see if they would change their mind. I feel like if people knew more details and more about me they would see that I was the problem. I went to a counselor-intern for 10 sessions and she said my ex was super manipulative and I am way too hard and unforgiving of myself. Even though I had told my ex before we broke up that I felt manipulated, hearing my counselor affirm that felt wrong.

I still feel like when I really think about it I was most of the problems and that I lacked patience and understanding. If I say that to friends/family they say otherwise. Are they just being overprotective of me? Some of the things that I am upset about now I wasn't upset about in the moment and I did not communicate to her when we were together, I say them out loud and my sister will be like ""hey, that's not ok to be told"".

For example, when we were breaking up we said a lot of nice things to each other but she also told me my kids would probably have emotional issues, I was not upset about that until someone pointed out that that is a weird thing to say to me, so are my feelings even valid? I just feel like I need someone to honestly tell me if I'm the problem or not because if I come to realize I screwed everything up I know I'd need to apologize to her again.

1ive0y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/1ive0y8/first_night_shift_ever/,First night shift ever.,"Started working at a chemical plant & my hours will be 6pm to 6am. It’s currently 2am and I’m getting my ass kicked (super tired). What do you guys drink or take to stay awake? I don’t like coffee because of the bitter taste, so should I maybe start drinking some to my liking (lots of sugar, milk, & creamer or whatever), & I also don’t like energy drinks… 
Any recommendation for me? I know both, coffee & energy drinks are pretty popular working night shift (& in general). 

Note: I didn’t get much sleep. Came into work at 6am, around 9am they asked me if I could cover tonights shift- which willingly I agreed just to see what my shifts would be like once I’m done training (so currently working mornings due to training). I stayed at work until 10am & attempted to go to sleep around 11:30am/noon but only slept for an hour & a half tops. ",6,1740212050.0,Nightshift,9,1.0,False

1ivdz3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ivdz3w/i_want_my_coworker/,I want my coworker.,"I (25F) work with this woman (25F), and while we started off as just colleagues, things have gotten a lot more friendly. We talk more openly now, sharing personal details and inside jokes, and there’s this playful energy between us that feels different from my other coworker relationships.

For context, I’m more masc-presenting, and she’s super femme—not that it matters, but I feel like it subtly signals that I’m queer. When we first met, I wouldn’t have expected us to become as close as we are now.

At first, our conversations were strictly about work, but over time, we started hanging out more—talking during breaks, joking around, and lingering in conversation. She does little things that make me second-guess whether this is just friendship or something more. She lets me borrow her hoodie at work when I’m cold (I’ve offered her mine before), pouts at me when she’s hungry or wants coffee, and always wants my opinion on clothes she’s thinking of buying. When I suggest something, she seems genuinely interested. And in the past, she’s even looked disappointed when I put my headphones in, knowing it meant we wouldn’t be able to chat as much.

Then, there was the festival. We both ended up there from work, but I lost my friends, my phone died, and my ride home disappeared. I ended up being the fourth wheel, but she shrugged it off, saying that without me, she would’ve been third-wheeling anyway.

At the end of the night, she invited me to her place to charge my phone. She made me tea, gave me a hoodie to wear, and we sat on her bed while she took off her makeup. She shared a personal, funny story—something that wouldn’t come up at work. Then she casually mentioned I could stay over. I hesitated, unsure of what she meant by it. She kept saying, “It’s up to you,” and eventually, I decided to go home, mostly to avoid any awkwardness in the morning. If I had stayed, we would’ve been in her bed, and I think I would’ve left feeling even more confused.

I’ve shared a bed with friends before, and normally, it wouldn’t be a big deal. But this felt different—maybe because of our dynamic, or the fact that this was my first time at her place. We aren’t exactly close friends or even outside-of-work friends yet, which makes me wonder…

You don’t just casually suggest something like that unless you’re extremely comfortable—or at least a little curious, right?

There’s a part of me that wonders if I’m imagining things. But at the same time, I think there’s massive chemistry.",0,1740211832.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False
