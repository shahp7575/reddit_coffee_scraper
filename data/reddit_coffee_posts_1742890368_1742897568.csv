1jjfyg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jjfyg5/this_has_got_to_be_lovebombing_right/,This has got to be love-bombing.. right?,"So.. beautiful folks of Reddit, I have what seems to be a love-bomber on my hands, and I’m looking for some advice/some of y’alls experiences so I can navigate this as effectively and rationally as possible. 

(Obligatory I’m on mobile so excuse the formatting)

I met this guy (he’s in his late 20s, I’m mid 20s) through some friends. We saw each other three times in the span of a month and a half in that group setting, and we’d talk most of those nights (including others that were also present)—mostly banter, jokes, and some flirting. 

I noticed he was very into me from the start, as well as our friends who started poking light-hearted fun at him and he didn’t deny those jabs. Though, he didn’t initiate any other contact outside of those nights, until a little over a week and a half ago, when we started texting every day.

The flirting quickly turned more ‘serious’, and I reciprocated the sentiment because I was into him as well. After a week of that, and him vaguely suggesting I’d come by his house for a cup of coffee, I asked if it was alright for me to take him up on that during the weekend. He said yes, and we had the coffee date last weekend, which was the first time we were together one on one. 

It went very well! We talked, clicked, and I kissed him first. I was happy, so was he, and then it got very intense, very fast.

During (our FIRST date after a week of texting) he said/did the following:

- Admitted he was nervous all day, because he’s ‘just so infatuated with me’ at the start of the date, then said “I’m so happy now that you’re here, I’ve completely fallen for you.”
- Continuously complimented me (which was admittedly very nice!) but also constantly said I was ‘perfect’.
- Said “We’re so alike.”, “It’s like we’re the same person.” and “It’s crazy how much we have in common.” etc.
- Carried me upstairs to his bed while saying “I really didn’t expect the night to go this way.” even though he was the one quite literally making the night go that way.
- But he did respect the fact that I didn’t want to hook up straight away! So we just made out mostly.
- Kept saying how “We’re both so obsessed with each other.” without much input from my side.
- Made a comment about how one of his closets was still empty ‘for my stuff’ after joking most of his storage space was a mess. 
- He then made a joke about how I wear a lot of rings (I do wear a ridiculous amount) and when I shrugged he said “Ah no big deal, we’ll find the space for another one, no problem.” 
- While making out he mumbled ‘love you’ but I genuinely thought I just didn’t hear him correctly.
- Until we were in his kitchen for a smoke and he hugged me and very seriously told me “I love you.” to which I did not know what to say, and so I just awkwardly said ‘oh!’. 
- Said “I love you” again when I kissed him goodbye, to which this time I did say “The fact that I’m not saying it back isn’t inherently negative, I just think it’s really fast.” and he replied “Oh, I know, don’t worry.” 

So he does respect my boundaries, but he also does his own thing on his own timeline, and I haven’t had nearly enough time to assess anything because all of this unfolded within a week, and anyone can pretend to be anything for a week. So! Fun!

Now, he continuously sends me those couple/romantic type reels that range from ‘send this to her if she’s got beautiful eyes’ to dramatic poetry like videos with texts like ‘just know you’re everything I’ve ever prayed for’, doubled down on about a hundred different pet names, emoji’s too, and basically tells me he’s thinking about me and can’t wait to see me again at least once a day. Granted, it’s been three days since the date. 

So, I think it’s safe to say the love-bombing is in full effect, though I don’t think it’s out of malicious intent—rather emotional immaturity/inability to regulate, or just some obsessive spiral into limerence.

We have other plans to get back on our feet but right now my focus is on the debt accumulated in such a short time while insurance handles other payments.  He has the income to pay it off before the end of the year. I just need help creating a new budget (we used excel before) and currently my brain is fried. I can’t even function looking at redoing a spreadsheet since my son has had a severe sleep regression since then and we’re currently all up. Are there any apps or any super simple to follow things to creating a budget? My reading comprehension is limited right now as I drink my 15 cup of coffee. I think it’s the stress. ,1,1742897387.0,debtfree,0,1.0,False

1jjfw22,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jjfw22/jords_troubled_life_chapter_seven/,Jord's troubled life | Chapter Seven,"‘Take some time to digest this,’ Lapo said, leaning forward across the conference table. His elbows settled into the polished surface, the gesture somehow both casual and deliberate, like a cat arranging itself before a pounce. ‘And in the meantime – are you ready for more training?’

The question hung in the air between them, heavy as morning fog off the harbour. Jord felt his throat constrict, a familiar tightness that reminded him of childhood swimming lessons – that moment before the plunge when fear and excitement became indistinguishable. *Devil*, he thought, the word rising unbidden like a prayer or curse. ‘Y-yes,’ he managed, the word catching slightly on its way out, like fabric snagging on a nail.

Something in his response made Lapo smile – not the sharp, predatory expression Jord had seen during the warehouse operation, but something softer, almost paternal. It reminded him, oddly, of the way his father used to look at him during their rare fishing trips, when Jord would insist on trying one more cast despite the gathering dark, despite the empty bucket that spoke of hours of failure.

‘See, that’s what I like,’ Lapo said, his voice taking on a warmth that seemed to fill the sterile conference room, transforming it into something more intimate, more dangerous. That grit, that determination, the ability to overcome impossible odds. His words took on a rhythmic quality, like waves against the dock. ‘The hunger for more, always bending to the world’s whims till you master it.’

The words washed over Jord like tidewater, their meaning slipping through his fingers even as their weight settled in his chest. He recognised in Lapo’s rambling monologue an echo of his parents’ late-night mutterings – those hushed, weary conversations over the kitchen table, where the future was an unshaped thing, heavy with uncertainty. It was that same intensity, the same quiet desperation to try to shape an unyielding world into something concrete, manageable. The tremor in his left hand had stilled, he noticed distantly.

‘Time awaits for no being – let’s start, then,’ Lapo said, rising from the table with a grace that seemed at odds with his weathered appearance. The words hung in the air like morning mist, both invitation and command.

The familiar exchange – ‘Track three?’ ‘Track three’ – carried the weight of ritual, as if they were priests preparing for morning devotions. 

The sky lightened still, the compound around them still wrapped in that peculiar stillness that comes before shift change. The buildings stood like sleeping giants, their windows dark and waiting, while skeleton crews moved through corridors like blood through drowsy veins. Soon the skin of night would be shed, and day shift would arrive with their coffee cups and conversation, but for now, the silence held.

They began their warm-up, footfalls marking time like a metronome. The rhythm reminded Jord of early mornings at home, when he’d hear his father’s work boots on the stairs, heading out for the first shift at the mill. Elia at three years old, standing on a chair pulled up to the counter, determined to “help” make breakfast. ‘Early bird catches the worm!’ he’d chirp, parroting their mother’s words while almost toppling a box of cereal. Jord, then eleven, had always kept one hand hovering behind his baby brother’s back, ready to catch him if he fell.

‘Sorry, sir,’ Jord ventured, his breath visible in the cool air, ‘but why do we train so early?’

‘I like the coolness of the morning, and –’ He raised a hand to his ear, the gesture almost theatrical, yet somehow genuine. ‘– if you listen good enough, you can hear the heart of the city start beating up, trains roaring to life, cars racing down the street.’ His words carried the weight of long consideration, like stones polished smooth by years of turning them over. ‘It always fascinated me, this state. A state of torpor, then, that of awakening. Always made me wonder what awaits us after all this. Maybe we will awaken again, maybe not.’ He turned to Jord. ‘Do you believe, Whittaker?’

The question settled between them like morning dew. Jord thought of childhood Sundays, of wooden pews and whispered prayers, of trying to keep a squirming Elia quiet with silent games and smuggled candies while their mother’s hands stayed folded neatly in her lap and their father’s remained restless.

‘I... I don’t think so,’ he admitted, each word carefully chosen. ‘I’ve pondered sometimes. Did the functions but never with conviction, much more like a worker with his shift. You understand?’ The comparison felt right – faith and work, both requiring attendance without guaranteeing belief. ‘I... I was there, watched everything, trying it, but it never gripped me, that conviction, that solid conviction to believe that help will come regardless of one's efforts. It’s a bit complicated, sir.’

Lapo's huff carried neither judgment nor approval. ‘What isn’t?’

‘But... I think I liked... a bit?’ Jord added, the words falling soft as footsteps. ‘I still don’t know, sir.’

Lapo’s response was physical rather than verbal – a subtle increase in pace that transformed their walk into an easy jog. Jord matched him stride for stride, their breathing falling into rhythm with each other and the awakening city around them. In that moment, beneath the lightening sky, the track felt less like training ground and more like a path to something Jord couldn’t quite name.

Eight kilometres left their mark in sweat and burning muscles, but it was the promise of what came next that made Jord's heart quicken. Lapo's pace slowed to a walk, his boots scuffing against the pavement.

‘Today, no sabres,’ Lapo said, voice gentle as morning itself. ‘We'll start with handguns. Up to the task, do you think?’

The armoury carried its own particular silence. Greg’s morning greeting hung in the air like early mist as Lapo made his request: ‘The Ciretta and the CR-8; And a box of projectiles.’

Jord watched Greg’s practised movements, the way his hands cradled each weapon and form with familiar reverence. It reminded him of how his mother would handle Elia’s first pair of glasses, cleaning them each night with careful, loving attention.

They settled at a table in the adjacent building, morning light streaming through high windows to paint patterns across the dismantled weapons. Lapo’s voice took on a different quality then, something between a teacher’s patience and a father’s concern.

‘First, you must learn how a firearm works,’ he began, his hands moving with deliberate grace. ‘Treat every firearm as loaded,’ Lapo emphasized, and Jord thought of Elia’s old chemistry set, how their mother had insisted on proper safety protocols even with harmless solutions. The memory brought a faint smile to his lips – some lessons, it seemed, carried across all sorts of boundaries.

As Lapo began disassembling the weapons, his movements became almost meditative. ‘One must be intimately familiar with one’s tools,’ he explained, ‘if one wishes to get the most from them.’

The words reverberated inside Jord’s skull – *that man’s fall*, a puppet with its string cut.

Lapo snapped his fingers dragging Jord’s attention to the present. ‘Lost yourself, Whittaker?’ His voice softened, an unexpected fracture in his drillmaster demeanour. ‘I know from experience yesterday’s… events unsettle the mind. If you need a day’s grace, I’ll grant it.’

‘No. Please continue.’ Jord’s knee jogged beneath the table. ‘I – I drifted. Apologies, sir. But how…’ He swallowed, the memory pooling metallic on his tongue. ‘How can flesh – life – turn to *nothing*? Decades of breath and thought, erased by a trigger-squeeze. Doesn’t that render every struggle… meaningless, *futile*?’ His gaze held Lapo’s, defiance and desperation braided.

The older man stilled. For a heartbeat, Jord glimpsed something behind his mentor’s eyes – a shadowed corridor lined with unspoken names.

‘That…’ Lapo wet his lips, the gesture uncharacteristically hesitant. ‘…is a philosopher’s riddle. And I?’ A hollow chuckle. ‘Just a soldier.’ He leaned closer, the table’s varnish creaking beneath his palms. ‘But here’s what war taught me: life’s weight isn’t in its duration. It’s in what *burns* between people. Shared joys. Shared wounds.’ His calloused thumb brushed the dismantled pistol between them. ‘You want meaning? You shall *Forge it*. Now – ’ He lifted the firing pin, its steel glinting like a frog’s well.‘ – will you learn?’

Jord nodded.

‘Then mirror my movements.’

The firearm’s innards sprawled across the table – springs and chambers laid bare as a surgeon’s tableau. Jord’s fingers trembled, tracing the lethal geometry. Lapo’s hands moved with confessional slowness, each disassembly a lesson.

Lapo’s quiet pride warmed the air between them as Jord finally mastered the ritual – disassemble, clean, reassemble – his hands growing more confident with each cycle. Thirty-some attempts had carved the movements into muscle memory, like learning a dance where every step could mean the difference between life and death.

‘Ready to give it voice?’ Lapo asked, and Jord nodded, his throat too tight for words. ‘We’ve got an indoor range here,’ Lapo continued, his voice carrying the patient cadence of a mentor. ‘For the bigger toys – long-range work, explosives – we head outside city limits.’

The indoor range welcomed them with the sharp perfume of cordite and the rhythmic percussion of another shooter's practice. Paper targets hung like spectral witnesses at varying distances, their silhouettes waiting in judgment up to a hundred meters away. Lapo stepped up first, his movements fluid with the ease of long familiarity. The gun sang in his hands, each shot finding home in the centre-mass of the targets until only the two furthest remained untouched – a deliberate demonstration of both skill and limitation.

When Jord’s turn came, the closest targets bore his marks like hesitant kisses, while the distant ones remained pristine, mocking his efforts with their unblemished faces. The last shell casing hit the floor with a sound like a falling tear.

‘What have you learned?’ Lapo's question hung in the air.

‘That I’m no good at shooting?’ Jord offered, his voice small in the vastness of the range.

Lapo’s chuckle was gentle, understanding. ‘You’ll learn.’ His fingers found his eyebrow, scratching thoughtfully. ‘But think back to yesterday's lesson with the sabre. Did nothing there give you an idea? Nothing?’

Jord shook his head.

‘A sabre,’ Lapo began, his words measured like carefully counted steps, ‘demands intimacy with intent. You can't dance between decisions when steel meets steel – hesitation is an invitation to your own ending. Every stroke must flow from absolute clarity of purpose.’ His eyes met Jord’s, holding them with the weight of hard-won wisdom. ‘A handgun’s no different. You can spray bullets like seeds in the wind, but such desperate gardens rarely bloom.’

The words struck Jord like a physical blow, settling deep in his chest where confusion met dawning realisation. He had dismissed yesterday's event as mere jest, a fleeting moment of insignificance, but now Lapo's wisdom penetrated his defences. Still, understanding lurked just beyond his grasp, like a shadow he couldn't quite catch.

‘But... how?’ The words escaped him, barely more than a whisper.

Lapo’s eyes softened with the patience of a man who had walked this path before. ‘It seems you need more intimate acquaintance with the sword. Your blindness to your own limitations is… telling’. He paused, a subtle weight of self-reproach in his voice. ‘I’ve neglected our sparring. Come, let’s backtrack.’

The ritual of retrieving weapons and completing forms carried its own quiet ceremony, each signature a promise of dedication to come. When they finally stood facing each other, the air between them hummed with anticipation.

‘En garde!’

‘En what?’ Jord's voice carried the tremor of uncertainty. ‘Sorry, sir, I don’t understand.’

‘Follow my movements,’ Lapo’s voice gentled. ‘I’ll shape your form afterwards.’

And so began the dance of master and novice. Jord shadowed Lapo’s movements like a dutiful echo – first a basic guard, then low, then high, each position a new language his body struggled to learn. When they moved to responses and attacks, Jord’s forms dissolved at the first hint of resistance, his stance betraying every uncertainty within. Each point of contact revealed another weakness: here, where rigidity was needed there was none, there, where tension melted when it should have held firm. For two hours, they wove this pattern of instruction and correction.

When Lapo finally detected improvement – modest but noteworthy – he called for their lunch respite. Yet after their meal, as they resumed their positions, Jord’s movements had lost their earlier promise. His mind, weighted with the morning’s lessons, had become as rigid as his earliest attempts, each gesture now carved from exhaustion rather than potential.

And so the day led onward, Lapo driving Jord relentlessly towards that sacred exhaustion where mind and body find their tenuous peace. Like a sculptor chipping away at resistant stone, Lapo worked until Jord’s defences crumbled, until his thoughts – so persistently circular – finally yielded to the simple truth of movement and breath.

When Jord’s limbs could bear no more, trembling like autumn leaves in a gentle breeze, Lapo called an end to their dance. The day had slipped away unnoticed, as days often do when one walks the path of transformation. Their farewell carried the weight of shared understanding, of barriers crossed and distances shortened.

On the street, Jord lifted his weary gaze skyward, finding solace in the vast expanse above. The evening sky hung in that precious balance between day and night, still touched by the sun’s farewell kisses, yet beginning to reveal its stellar secrets. Among the first brave stars, one celestial body shone with particular brilliance, standing apart from its dimmer companions like a singular truth amidst a sea of questions. The sight tugged at something within him, a recognition just beyond his grasp, but exhaustion had softened the edges of his curiosity into a gentle wonder.

The walk home became a meditation of sorts, his tired body carrying him through familiar streets while his mind floated in that peculiar space between thought and absence. His soiled training clothes lay bundled in his backpack, each crease and stain a testament to the day's lessons – not just in swordplay, but in the art of surrender to learning itself.

–––

Home bloomed before him like a familiar embrace, the cramped kitchen transformed into a sanctuary of ordinary magic. His family had settled into their evening ritual with the comfortable precision of long practice: Elia bent over his book, pages whispering secrets; his father navigating the newspaper’s labyrinth of puzzles; his mother orchestrating the evening meal with practised grace. Even in such close quarters, they had learned the delicate dance of coexistence, each claiming their space while remaining bound in the invisible web of family.

Elia’s head lifted at his entrance, his eyes bright with unspoken questions. ‘So, how did it go?’

‘All good’, Jord managed, the words feeling inadequate against the weight of the day’s revelations. ‘I… enquired about yesterday. It was bad chance, the commander said.’ He paused, suddenly aware of how his muscles ached with new knowledge. ‘Talk to you later, just give me a moment to change, and I’ll tell you what I can.’

The ritual of changing clothes became a quiet meditation, each movement a reminder of the day’s lessons. When he returned to the kitchen's warmth, the simple act of setting the kettle to flame felt like a bridge between two worlds. ‘Tea?’

His mother’s decline left three cups to arrange, each placement deliberate as chess pieces on a board. The sugar bowl found its place at the centre, a silent offering of sweetness to temper whatever conversations might follow.

‘Anyone curious about anything?’ Jord’s question hung in the air like morning mist, met with a silence that seemed to hold both everything and nothing. He couldn’t decipher whether their quiet spoke of indifference or of care so profound it stole their voices.

Turning to safer ground, he sought refuge in his brother's day. ‘So Elia, how did your day go?’

‘Pretty meh’, he offered, but his words carried the weight of untold stories. ‘Helped old man Artivi a bit. Diagnosed a couple of cars. One was a luxury model – quite nice, actually.’ He paused, something flickering behind his eyes. ‘Ah yes, helped some kids repair their bikes, too. One asked me to send their regards to you.’ His gaze held something indefinable, a question wrapped in an observation.

‘Did the kid say why?’

‘No.’

‘Huh.’ The mystery settled in Jord’s mind like a puzzle piece without a home. *Why would some kids ask about me?* The thought spiralled through possibilities, each one dissolving before it could fully form. *Maybe an old classmate’s child? But who would... perhaps Ralpanion's kid?*

The kettle’s cry pierced his reverie, a sharp note cutting through the gentle symphony of family sounds. He moved through the familiar motions of serving tea, each pour a meditation, each ceramic cup accepting its steeping charge with quiet dignity. The tea bags unfurled like thoughts seeking their own clarity in the gathering dusk of evening.

And so the evening flowed onwards like a gentle stream, family banter weaving through the spaces between bites of their mother’s cooking – each morsel carrying the familiar comfort of home. When they finally retired to their rooms, the house settled into its nighttime whispers, creaking floorboards and distant sounds creating a lullaby of the ordinary.

But the day’s lessons pulsed behind his eyelids – Lapo’s sabre arcs transcribed into neural pathways, the handgun’s recoil etched into muscle memory. A perverse alchemy: close-quarters fury had honed his aim. Steel and trigger, two languages fused at the root. He traced the paradox in the dark, fingertips brushing the bruise on his collarbone. *How had he not seen it?* The kinship between blade and bullet, both demanding surrender to momentum’s cruel logic.

And in the quiet darkness of his room, a peculiar peace settled over him regarding the misdirection that had shaped his path. The thought that his journey could have unfolded differently – worse – lingered at the edges of his consciousness like shadows at twilight. Yet he found himself strangely grateful for the very deception that had led him here, as if fate had conspired to protect him from bleaker possibilities. These were waters too deep to wade into tonight, currents of what-ifs that threatened to pull him under if he dwelt too long upon them.

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

1jjfu3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1jjfu3c/switch/,Switch,"When Jay was a little boy, bedtime was always a game. His mum or dad would flick off the downstairs light and shout, “The monster’s coming!” before they all dashed up the stairs, giggling breathlessly. Whoever made it to the top first was “safe.” It was silly, innocent fun—but somehow, the fear stuck.



Now he was twenty-five. Grown. Independent. A man.

And yet… every time he turned off a light downstairs, he still found himself running.



It was half past midnight when he stumbled through the front door—half-pissed, bones aching from a long day, the taste of cheap lager and wine still clinging to his tongue. The house was cold and still. He leaned against the wall, eyes squinting up at the darkened staircase.



Only one light left on—the hallway lamp.



He knew the routine. Flick the switch. Run. Ten steps. If you reach the top before it catches you, you’re safe.



Jay laughed under his breath. “Grow up, mate,” he muttered. But his hand trembled slightly as he reached for the switch.



He couldn’t run. Not properly. Not tonight.



Still, he braced himself, muscles tensing. “One… two… three.”



Click.



Darkness swallowed the hallway.



Something about it felt… wrong.



He lurched forward, forcing his legs to move, staggering up the steps two at a time. Panic clutched at his chest like icy fingers. His foot hit the tenth step and he paused, panting. A slow grin crept onto his face.



“What are you doing, you idiot?” he whispered, laughing to himself. “You’re not six anymore.”



He turned to head for his bedroom—



And something cold and jagged grabbed his ankle.



Before he could scream, it yanked him backwards, down the stairs, into the black. His head cracked against something hard. The darkness wasn’t empty. It moved.



Upstairs, the hallway remained silent. Calm. Nothing stirred.



The light switch clicked back on.



But no one was there.








Jay was woken by his alarm at exactly 6:00am.



The sound pierced through the darkness like a siren in an empty tunnel. He reached over to silence it, eyes still crusted from sleep. His bedroom was cloaked in shadows. The pale blue glow from the streetlamp outside offered the only light, filtered weakly through the blinds.



It was too dark. Darker than it should’ve been.



He sat up slowly. The dream—or whatever it was—still lingered at the edges of his mind. Images flickered like broken film: the top of the stairs, something grabbing him and pulling him backwards into… what exactly?



He rubbed his face, heart thudding quietly. “Must’ve been the wine,” he muttered, swinging his legs out of bed. “I’ll never drink again.”



As he dressed and got ready for work, everything felt a beat out of sync. The silence was louder. His reflection in the mirror seemed slower to react. The kettle took ages to boil, and when it finally did, it screamed instead of whistled.



The journey to work was oddly… cheerful. That was the first red flag.



Everyone he passed on the street smiled at him. Not polite smiles—beaming ones. Eyes wide, teeth bright, grins plastered from ear to ear like dolls at a tea party. He shrugged it off as early morning paranoia. Maybe people were just in a good mood. Maybe the world wasn’t falling apart for once.



But even at work—where smiles usually go to die—everyone seemed happy. Too happy. His co-workers greeted him with enthusiasm that bordered on manic. One of them actually clapped when he walked past. His manager patted him on the back. A colleague offered him a muffin and said, “Isn’t it a beautiful day to be alive?”



Jay sat at his desk, his skin crawling beneath his shirt. Something was wrong. He felt like a visitor in his own life.



His phone buzzed. A message from Chloe:

“Meet you outside the building at 1pm for lunch xxx”



He sighed in relief. Maybe talking to Chloe would clear his head. Maybe she’d listen, laugh at his paranoia, tell him it was just a dream.






Lunchtime came. Jay was still hunched over a report, the numbers swimming before his eyes. He checked the clock—1:10pm.



“Bollocks,” he muttered. He tapped out a quick text:

“Sorry babe. Running late. Start without me. I’ll be there asap! X”



He braced himself for the usual barrage. Chloe wasn’t exactly known for her patience. He expected the passive-aggressive messages to flood in.



Instead:



“Don’t worry babe. I’ll order for you now so you can start eating as soon as you get here! Xxx”



Jay blinked.



Well… that was weird.



When he finally arrived at the café, Chloe was already seated outside, waving enthusiastically. She looked radiant. Glowing. Her eyes sparkled with affection, and her voice was unusually soft. “Hey, babe! I missed you!”



Jay sat down, breathless. “Sorry I—”



“No worries at all,” she cut in, handing him a drink. “You work so hard. You deserve this.”



He stared at her.



This wasn’t Chloe. Not really. Not the Chloe who’d get moody over a five-minute delay. Not the Chloe who once cried because he ordered her chips instead of sweet potato fries.



She was too nice. Too patient. Too perfect.



But maybe he was just being a twat. Maybe this was her turning over a new leaf.



He chuckled nervously. “You’ll laugh at this, but I had the weirdest dream last night…”



And he told her everything. The stairs. The ‘monster’. The hand pulling him back into the darkness. He watched her carefully, waiting for a smirk, a quip, something to bring him back to reality.



But she just nodded. Smiling. Eyes locked onto his. Not blinking.



When he finished, she leaned in and touched his hand. “That’s fascinating. Thank you for sharing it with me.”



“…Right.”



They ate. Or at least—he ate. Chloe played with her salad, poking at the leaves but never lifting her fork to her mouth.



Jay frowned. “Aren’t you hungry?”



She paused. Glanced at her plate, then back at him. “Oh. I already ate. I was just pretending for you.”



“What?”



She smiled. “Nothing, babe.”






Back at the office, things unravelled fast.



Jay couldn’t focus. His screen blurred, his head throbbed. His reflection on the black monitor stayed frozen a second longer than it should’ve when he moved. Watching him. Mocking him.



He jolted back. But when he turned the screen on, it was just him again. Pale. Shaken. Hollow.



Everyone else around him… kept smiling.



He turned slowly. His co-workers typed away, all in perfect rhythm. All grinning. None blinking.



“Jay,” his manager called out, walking past and clapping him on the shoulder. “Keep up the great work!”



“But I haven’t submitted—”



Roger was already gone.







The days blurred.



Then the weeks.



Jay tried to keep track of time, but everything bled into everything else. Morning, afternoon, night—it all looked the same. Felt the same. Grey. Off-kilter. Like a dream you couldn’t wake up from, no matter how loud you screamed into the dark.



People still smiled at him.



Always smiling.



At the coffee shop, the barista said, “So good to see you again, Jay!”

He’d never seen her before in his life.



His neighbour waved cheerfully every morning and said the exact same sentence: “Another beautiful day, eh?”

Even when it was pouring. Even when thunder shook the windows.



At work, Roger still clapped him on the back. “Proud of you, son!”

Jay hadn’t submitted a single report in weeks. Hadn’t even logged into the system some days. No one noticed. Or if they did—they didn’t care. They just kept smiling. Typing. Smiling.



Even Chloe. Especially Chloe.



She still texted him every day. Called him “babe”. Cooked for him. Laughed at his jokes. But her eyes were wrong. Her voice sometimes played on loop. She once repeated the same sentence four times in a row—word for word—before she stopped and blinked, as if rebooting.



Jay stopped going to hers after that.



He tried to talk to his mum, but she didn’t pick up the phone. When he visited her house, someone else opened the door. A man he’d never seen before, who smiled and said, “Wrong house, mate.”

But Jay had grown up in that house. He remembered the chipped bricks by the garage. The rose bush his mum kept forgetting to water.



He walked away, stomach hollow and icy.



It was all… wrong. The world. The people. The air.



Jay was slipping.



His thoughts twisted in on themselves. He found it hard to finish sentences. He stood in the middle of rooms, forgetting why he went in there. Sometimes he caught himself smiling in the mirror, wide and unnatural, and he didn’t know how long he’d been doing it.



He hadn’t dreamt since that night.



No more dreams.



Just waking madness.






One night, the silence was louder than usual.



Jay sat in the bath. The water was lukewarm now. He hadn’t moved in hours.



The room was dim, lit only by the flickering bulb above the sink. The ceiling fan buzzed, a low insect hum that scratched at the back of his mind. The tiles were cold beneath his skin, his fingers pruned and pale.



He stared at the wall. Then the water. Then nothing.



Something inside him had finally snapped.



There was no one left. No one real. No one to ask for help. He didn’t even know what help would look like anymore. His reality was folding in on itself, and he was sick of trying to hold it up with shaking hands.



His breath hitched.



He reached for the small metal tin by the side of the bath—the one with the old razor blades he never threw away.



The silence leaned in closer. Listening.



Jay picked up the blade.



Tears ran down his cheeks as he whispered to himself, “I don’t want to be here anymore. I just want to wake up.”



He pressed it against his wrist.



A deep breath. Sharp. Final.



Then he cut.






The water turned red.



His vision blurred.



Everything became… quieter.



Finally.







In another world—Jay sits at a table in his favourite restaurant.



The booths are the same deep red. The air smells of garlic and butter. The music drifts lazily through the speakers, just as it always has. Everything looks right.



But something is wrong.



Jay sits across from Chloe, his smile stretched unnaturally wide, his eyes locked onto hers. He hasn’t blinked once.



“Babe… are you alright?” she asks, her voice barely above a whisper. “You’ve been acting so strange lately. Please. Just talk to me.”



He doesn’t respond.



The silence presses in around them.



A waiter appears, carrying two plates. He sets them down gently, then glances at Jay. Their eyes meet—and hold.



The waiter’s smile twitches at the corner.



“Funny seeing you here,” he says quietly, almost like a joke between old friends. “Looks like we’re both staying.”



Jay’s grin widens, just a little.



Chloe doesn’t move.

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

**PLATONIC FRIENDSHIP ONLY, AND ALSO PREFERABLY BASED IN BRITAIN/UK.

I had wanted to give up coffee for years because I realised I was completely hooked on it—not even for the energy, really, but for my mood. If I didn’t have a cup first thing in the morning, I wasn't functioning all day. I’d wake up and go straight to making a very strong coffee, sometimes drinking it throughout the whole morning just to feel “normal.” It didn’t feel like a casual habit anymore - I couldn't exist without it.

Eventually I quit, and after one week of feeling really down, I came out the other side feeling amazing. Much more stable moods, more energy in general. At one point, I started drinking a bottle of oolong kombucha daily (the good kind - no sugars or caffeine added post-fermentation). Interestingly, I had no side effects from it. No mood dependency, no withdrawal, no need to “have it”. It felt fine.

Later, I reintroduced one cup of decaf coffee per day, and after a month or two, I slowly started to notice those same old patterns creeping back in—feeling like I needed that hit in the morning, and just feeling more tired overall.

The confusing part is that kombucha does have some caffeine - it's often stated that the fermentation process removes around 2/3 of the caffeine, but the remaining 1/3 should still be more than is contained in decaf coffee. But clearly, something about it seems to hit differently.

Any ideas why even decaf coffee would affect me more than kombucha? Would love to hear your thoughts or if anyone’s experienced something similar.",1,1742896375.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1jjfoug,https://i.redd.it/m12ustdi5tqe1.jpeg,Exploring Church Incense Fragrances: A Scent Journey Few in India Know About,"
In India, most of us are familiar with temple aromas- sandalwood, camphor(Kapoor), frankincense(loban), which are usually mixed with florals like Jasmine (Mogra), Rose, Tuberose (Rajnigandha) etc. 

But one scent family that remains largely unexplored in India is Church Incense fragrances. 

These perfumes are inspired by the deep, resinous, and spiritual aroma of old cathedrals, blending frankincense, myrrh, benzoin, labdanum, and other resins with smoky woods and green notes to recreate the mystical aura of these sacred spaces.

In my quest for deep, resinous blends, I came across this family and I have to be honest, they became one of the most beautiful blends I've smelled. 

These are not for Dance party's, these are gentlemen's & gentlewomen's scents. Wear these with good clothes in night times or rainy cold days or when you're just by yourself and these will force you to introspect how perfumes are not just about smelling good, but it's a form of artistic expression. 

And this expression is for Gods. Meditative and calming in their nature. As if you can focus on the spiritual side of your mind when you wear these.

If you've ever been curious about how European churches or ancient monasteries smell, here are some amazing fragrances that capture that essence. 

I will give very short reviews for some of the fragrances I own or have tried a sample.

Casbah (Robert Piguet):

It's a very beautiful and meditative mix of Moroccan spices, incense, and cedarwood, this is an exotic, slightly dry incense rather than the deeply resinous type.  This is the best in the lot. Pure art.

I have posted a full review of this in my profile.

Larmes du Désert (Atelier des Ors):

 This one again has green woodsy notes like like cypress and patchouli with incense, cedar, benzoin and amber and some other woody notes. It's kind of an Ambery slightly spicy scent with a beautiful slightly sweet dry down. You can also check out it's clone - Arabian incense. It's very similar just taking a bit of a hit in quality, but totally worth it. 

Encens Suave (Matiere Premiere):

A more luxurious take on incense, adding vanilla and coffee for a slightly gourmand touch while still maintaining a smoky, resinous core. This is one of the easiest of the bunch to wear and relate to by Indians. Do give this a try. 

La Liturgie des Heures (Jovoy Paris):

it's an incense church like with frankincense, myrrh and musk which are supported by top notes of Cypress and green notes. It's a bit warm and cozy and has a meditative vibe. I feel this can be layered well with some authentic foresty type scents to make it smell like a  an old dilapidated church in a cold forest. 

Montale Full Incense: 

This is one of the most realistic, no non sense church-like incense fragrance. It opens with a dry, smoky resinous incense note, similar to interiors of old churches filled with the scent of burning frankincense. The dominant note is Somalian frankincense, which is slightly peppery and gives a meditative aura. 
Cedarwood adds a dry, woody heart, with resins like labdanum and elemi giving a slightly sweet, balsamic, and ambery warmth. It's really hard to find. Hopefully I'll get a full bottle someday at a good price.

Tiger's nest by Memo:

This is one is inspired by the Tiger's nest monastery in Bhutan, it's an ambery incense fragrance with smoky, resinous, and spicy notes. It smells mystical and has temple like vibe with frankincense, amber, and vanilla, rose and some other notes. This is not a straightforward catholic kind of experience, it's more closer to incenses in India as it's inspired by our peaceful neighbour Bhutan.  

For those in India looking to explore something beyond the usual oud, vetiver, and designer ambers or fruits and florals,  church incense fragrances offer a rich, atmospheric experience. They can be meditative, spiritual, mysterious, or even gothic, depending on the composition.


There are many left for me to explore and the holy grail I'm in search of is Comme des garcons incense series: 

Avignon, Kyoto, Zagorsk.

Have you tried any incense-based fragrances? Would love to hear your thoughts!

Plot:

8pm at night I had taken my wife to hospital as she had badly hurt her leg. 2 hours in A&E, I began to get a little bored. I hit the shops and cafe there, ignoring any food related issues I might bring on myself. I had a whole pack of mini cream eggs, a BLT sandwich, a coffee, a cake slice.

Leaving the hospital and walking back to the car around 10pm. My lower left stars to feel a bit achy. Intermittent passing of gas. In the car leaving the A&E car park my lower left pain intensified, I planned to drive to a near by 24 hour Tesco to use their toilet.

I park up in the Tesco, a light jog into the store to find the toilet. One bog is blocked, the other is out of order and locked. Pain intensifying, fell back to plan B, buy Imodium and buscopan.

In noticeable pain, walked back to the car. Sat down in the drivers seat, and it began…

The urgency, the inability to just about squeeze my cheeks to keep it in!  I then panic drove back to the hospital.  Every light and bit of traffic over the 6 minute journey had me near shouting in agony, the pain in my rectum and lower left was extreme, my wife encouraging me “just s**t yourself already and be done with it”, but no, I refused. It was coming and trying to get out on its own. My own anatomy failing. I obviously don’t know what it’s like to give birth as a man, but I reckon this is the closest I’ve been.

I sped back to the hospital and swung the car round the entrance fast and furious, straight into the ambulance depot and hit the brakes hard, telling my wife to park the car with her damaged leg, I left the car and the door open and I RAN into that A&E to the nearest toilet, with about 1 second to spare, before one of the worst purges I’ve ever experienced.

# Electric Kettle vs. Kettle & Warmer 2025: Efficiency Tested - Which Heats Best?

In the bustling world of business, from bustling office spaces to high-volume restaurants, the demand for instant hot water is constant. Coffee, tea, instant soups – the list goes on. And in 2025, with an increasing focus on sustainability and cost-effectiveness, the question remains: which is the better choice for heating water, an electric kettle or a kettle and warmer combination? This article provides an in-depth analysis, helping business owners, facility managers, procurement specialists, and restaurant owners make informed decisions that optimize efficiency and minimize costs.

[[Explore Top Rated electric kettle vs kettle and warmer efficiency differences on Amazon.]](https://wabashop.com/travel-gifts-7/?kw=%%keyword%)
## Understanding the Basics: Electric Kettles and Kettle Warmers

Before diving into a detailed efficiency comparison, let's establish a clear understanding of each appliance.

An **electric kettle** is a self-contained appliance designed specifically to boil water. It consists of a heating element submerged in water within a contained vessel. When activated, the element rapidly heats the water, and most models feature an automatic shut-off function once boiling point is reached. Simplicity, speed, and safety are its hallmarks.

A **kettle warmer**, on the other hand, is designed to maintain the temperature of pre-heated water over an extended period. typically, a kettle warmer is a separate unit from the kettle itself. You heat the water using a stovetop kettle (sometimes an electric kettle), pour it into a compatible kettle that sits on the warmer, and the warmer keeps the water at a set temperature. The focus is on convenience and availability of hot water rather than rapid heating.

[[Explore Top Rated electric kettle vs kettle and warmer efficiency differences on Amazon.]](https://wabashop.com/travel-gifts-7/?kw=%%keyword%)
## Electric Kettle Energy Consumption: Speed and Efficiency in Short Bursts

An electric kettle excels at quickly bringing water to a boil. Its efficiency stems from the direct contact between the heating element and the water, minimizing heat loss.Studies suggest that electric kettles can reach around 80% efficiency or higher [1, 4]. Understanding electric kettle power usage is crucial for businesses looking to optimize their energy consumption.

The key advantage here is that the electric kettle uses energy only when actively boiling water. Once the water reaches its boiling point, the automatic shut-off feature prevents further energy waste. This makes it ideal for situations where hot water is needed frequently but not continuously.

Considering the cost of running electric kettle, it’s tightly correlated to its wattage and the boil time. Rapid boil kettle efficiency is definitely a point to consider in commercial settings where time is money.

## Kettle Warmer Energy consumption: Sustained Warmth, Sustained Usage

Kettle warmers offer the convenience of having hot water readily available throughout the day. However, this convenience comes at a cost: continuous energy consumption. While the kettle warmer wattage vs electric kettle wattage is typically lower when it is idle compared to when the kettle boils, the constant operation means that the overall energy consumption can be significantly higher.

The efficiency of a kettle warmer depends heavily on its insulation and temperature control mechanism. Some models are more energy-efficient than others, but even the best ones constantly draw power to maintain the desired water temperature. The impact of kettle warmer on electricity bill is usually noticeable, especially in situations or when large numbers of them are operating concurrently.

Moreover, kettle warmer temperature control efficiency can vary significantly. Some models may struggle to maintain a consistent temperature, leading to energy waste as they cycle on and off more frequently. So, when pondering how efficient are kettle warmers, the answer can be complex depending on the specific model and its purpose.

## A Head-to-head Comparison: Electric Kettle vs. Kettle Warmer Electricity Usage

The most crucial factor for commercial decision-makers is the electric kettle vs kettle warmer electricity usage. To accurately assess this, it's important to compare their typical usage patterns.

*   **Frequency of use:** how frequently enough is hot water needed? If it's frequent but sporadic (e.g., several times an hour during peak hours in a cafe, more sparingly at other times), an electric kettle might be more efficient. If hot water is needed virtually constantly throughout the day (e.g., for constant tea service in a hotel lobby), a kettle warmer might seem more appealing.

*   **Volume of water:** How much water is needed at a time? An electric kettle is well-suited for quickly boiling specific amounts of water.A kettle warmer might be useful if consistently small amounts of hot water must be available.Rapid water heating is a crucial consideration for cafes and restaurants.

*   **Operating hours:** how long will the appliance be in use each day? Even though a kettle warmer consumes less power at any given time, over an 8-hour workday it could easily use more energy than an electric kettle that boils water several times.Long operating hours exacerbate the inefficiency of the constant power draw.

let’s illustrate with a hypothetical example: Imagine a small office where 10 employees each drink two cups of tea a day. With an electric kettle,they might boil water 2-3 times a day in total,using maybe 0.5 kWh of electricity. A kettle warmer, running for 8 hours, might use 1 kWh of continuous power consumption during the same time. Even though at any one point the kettle warmer seems more efficient, in this situation, its continuous usage causes it to use more energy.

## Cost Analysis: Considering the Long-term impact

The true cost of an appliance extends beyond the initial purchase price. It’s crucial to consider the total cost of ownership kettle, factoring in energy consumption, maintenance, and lifespan. Consider the cost of running electric kettle in relation to energy spikes when it’s turned on.

*   **Energy Costs:** As demonstrated above, the cumulative energy cost can vary greatly depending on the usage pattern. It's vital to estimate the daily power consumption of each option and multiply that by the electricity rate to project monthly energy expenses. Tools for calculating energy cost per drink can be useful for restaurants or cafes.

*   **Maintenance:** Electric kettles generally require minimal maintenance – descaling being the primary concern. Kettle warmers, however, may need more frequent cleaning. Heating elements can burn out.

*   **Lifespan:** The lifespan of both appliances varies depending on quality and usage. High-quality electric kettles with over heating protection and automatic shut off are usually more durable. Kettle warmers, with their continuous operation, may be more prone to wear and tear.

Procurement specialists should consider appliance lifecycle costs when drafting a request for proposals kettle. Sustainable procurement prioritizes long-term savings, which makes energy efficiency a key factor in purchasing discussions.

## Tailoring the Choice to Specific Business Needs

Let’s delve into the needs of the various target audiences that each kettle caters to.

### Business Owners and Managers

For business owners and managers, especially those focused on hospitality kettle solutions, commercial electric kettle models offer several advantages. Look for models with high wattage with over heating protection, durability, and automatic shut-off features. For locations that require constant access to hot water, consider an option that can handle large volumes efficiently instead of warming that same water for extended periods. Energy efficient appliances for business can significantly reduce electricity costs.

### Facility Managers and Building Management

Building-wide appliance needs require a data-driven approach. Performing energy audits to understand water usage patterns can help determine which type of kettle offers better building energy management overall. The ideal solution will need to balance convenience, reliability, minimal kettle maintenance costs and water heating systems which are affordable.

### Procurement Specialists

Procurement specialists need to look at numbers closely before making a decision. A vendor comparison kettle exercise that models different usage scenarios can help highlight the differences in long-term operating costs. Energy efficient purchasing guidelines should prioritize models with certifications or readily available data on energy consumption.### Restaurant and Cafe Owners

Restaurant and cafe owners prioritize speed when providing hot beverages such as coffee and tea and energy cost per drink. Instant hot water can improve customer satisfaction when delivered at the lowest costs. For high-volume establishments, consider commercial water boilers rather of relying on a single kettle, or a smaller commercial electric kettle for serving smaller numbers of customers.Rapid water heating is paramount. Tea warmer solutions are essential for venues specializing in tea.

## Energy Saving Tips for Electric Kettles and Kettle Warmers

Regardless of which appliance is chosen, there are several energy saving tips that can reduce electricity consumption:

*   **Only boil the necessary amount of water:** Boiling more water than needed wastes energy. Electric kettles with volume markings help prevent overfilling.
*   **Descale regularly:** Mineral build-up reduces heating efficiency. Descale electric kettles at least quarterly, or more frequently enough in areas with hard water.
*   **Use a timer (for kettle warmers):** If hot water is only needed during certain hours, use a timer to automatically switch off a kettle warmer during off-peak times.
*   **Choose energy-efficient models:** Look for appliances with good insulation and efficient temperature control.
*   **Consider variable temperature kettles:** Variable temperature kettle efficiency can be optimized by setting it to the exact temperature needed for different types of beverages.

We never used condoms but I am aware that he is a man, who lives alone, and was dating around before me. The second night I slept over I noticed that there were 3 condoms in his night stand.. as the months progressed I noticed the same three condoms in the same spot. 

So fast forward to a week ago I was organizing the room (my bf trusts me with his apt and has left me there alone various times) and I find an empty sex toy box (it’s for a bullet vibrator) inside the cubby of the same night stand that the 3 other condoms are laying around in. Inside the cubby I find the empty sex toy box and a condom. I inspected the condom and it must of belong to the same packet that the other 3 came from bc they all have the same expiration date (which is 2027). 

I obviously started freaking out and started moving the bed around and I find an open condom wrapper under the bed. Now… to be fair this condom wrapper was in the middle of under the bed surrounded by dust. I also noticed his suitcase from a trip he had last summer was still under there.. with the same clothes inside.


I texted him immediately and he didn’t think I was being manic or being insane or even accused me of snooping. He said he understood my frustration and that he’s very upset I had to see that. When we got home and we spoke he was calm, answered all my questions and told me it was pure laziness on his part. He assured me that both the wrapper and the box are old.

Now in his defense my boyfriend is messy. I’m talking about having the same sock lying around in the same corner for months. I left a water bottle on his coffee table one Sunday only to come back the next Friday and the water bottle was in the same spot. Also- inside the cubby was a letter from his ex family dated back to 2022. 

Outside of this incident he has never given me any red flags or signs of cheating. If anything - he is the one who wanted to go from dating to a serious relationship and has always been 100% honest about things I ask him- even if they are uncomfortable. He’s also the one who started buying things for me to feel comfortable in his apartment, making a closet space for me.. etc. 

So my question is… am I being naive? Or are men really that messy and forgetful? As soon as we had the conversation that night he cleaned the room and threw everything away… also to note- he shared this apartment with an ex but she moved out in 2023.

TL;DR found an empty sex toy box amongst my bfs stuff, he is known to be messy. ",2,1742895110.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

I'm on day five of my WW journey. I'm really enjoying tracking things and holding myself accountable on my over indulgent eating. I'm a female, 32, 11st 8lbs at 5'7. I haven't felt great in my body for a couple of years so I'm doing something about it. I'm also moving my body more and I've been syncing up my Google fit to the WW app which has been great! 

My question is to do with coffee. I know a lot of you have struggled with finding alternatives but I'm confused by what I'm logging. 


I drink Azera Americano instant coffee which is zero points. I use about 5-10 of whole milk which is coming up at zero points and 1 teaspoon of sugar which is 1 point. Am I doing something wrong? Does this mean I don't have to give up coffee?

# One of the questions I routinely get from customers goes something like this:

“Hey Geoff, I’m doing XXXXX and I just hit 4 million reps in my latest workout. Is that good?  
I read on the forum that some guys are doing 8 gajillion reps and I just want to know how I stack up…”  
Now obviously, I’m exaggerating on the rep count, but you get my drift, right?

And that’s because typically (but not always), I prescribe reps and sets, but NOT total workloads.

I let the workout duration be the governor of the amount of work completed, like 30 minutes for example.

So you may see “sets of 5,” or “ladders of 1,2,3,” or something kind of similar.

In other words, I rarely program “5x5.”

The reason I do this is to accommodate for individual differences.

**Differences in:**  
Strength levels  
Training age and background

Injury history

Endurance levels

They all factor in to “how many reps is best” for YOU.

I have a background in Olympic Weightlifting and have generally poor “endurance.”

So, if you looked at the number of Clean + Press sets I performed doing a program like ‘THE GIANT,’ they’d be quite low - maybe as low as 40 reps in a 30 minute period, depending on the size of the KBs I was using.

Other guys post numbers like 100 reps of Clean + Presses in 30 minutes.

To me, that’s mind-blowing. But good for them!

# So the only way you’ll know what’s “good” is to do three things:

1- Establish your RM for the particular program.  
2- Run your first training session and record the total number of sets and reps in your training log.  
3- Repeat #2 every training session and track the increase of total reps.  
“Good” is when you see those total reps rise over the course of time - 4 weeks… 6 weeks… 8 weeks… whatever the program duration is.  
And that’s because you’re only competing against yourself - no one else.  
But if you need a goal - something to measure your strength against, why not use my “STRONG ENOUGH” Standards?  
“How do you know if you’re ‘strong enough’?”  
Simple.

# Hit these targets:

1- Double Clean + Press w/ 2x32kg for 10 sets of 5 in 20 minutes.  
2- Double Front Squat w/ 2x32kg for 10 sets of 5 in 20 minutes.  
3- Single KB Snatch w/ 32kg for 100 reps in 10 minutes.  
Can’t hit them yet?  
Look out of reach?  
Maybe even impossible?  
Good!  
Now you have goals to work toward.  
Simply break them down into smaller units and then hit those targets.  
1- Use 2x16kg for the C+P and Front Squat, and 16kg for the Snatch.

2- Use 2x20kg for the C+P and Front Squat, and 20kg for the Snatch.

3- Use 2x24kg for the C+P and Front Squat, and 24kg for the Snatch.

4- Use 2x28kg for the C+P and Front Squat, and 28kg for the Snatch.

And as you focus on becoming “STRONG ENOUGH” you will \*magically\* -  
\[+\] Get leaner (lose fat) and strip fat off your waist

\[+\] Become more muscular and fill out your t-shirt sleeves

\[+\] Improve your conditioning levels so climbing the stairs and playing with your kiddos is no longer a chore

\[+\] Increase your daily energy so you’re not hitting your 3rd cup of coffee at 2pm

\[+\] Reverse your diseases so you can lower the dosages of your meds or eliminate them altogether  
And be proud of yourself once again.  
Stay Strong,

We never used condoms but I am aware that he is a man, who lives alone, and was dating around before me. The second night I slept over I noticed that there were 3 condoms in his night stand.. as the months progressed I noticed the same three condoms in the same spot. 

So fast forward to a week ago I was organizing the room (my bf trusts me with his apt and has left me there alone various times) and I find an empty sex toy box (it’s for a bullet vibrator) inside the cubby of the same night stand that the 3 other condoms are laying around in. Inside the cubby I find the empty sex toy box and a condom. I inspected the condom and it must of belong to the same packet that the other 3 came from bc they all have the same expiration date (which is 2027). 

I obviously started freaking out and started moving the bed around and I find an open condom wrapper under the bed. Now… to be fair this condom wrapper was in the middle of under the bed surrounded by dust. I also noticed his suitcase from a trip he had last summer was still under there.. with the same clothes inside.


I texted him immediately and he didn’t think I was being manic or being insane or even accused me of snooping. He said he understood my frustration and that he’s very upset I had to see that. When we got home and we spoke he was calm, answered all my questions and told me it was pure laziness on his part. He assured me that both the wrapper and the box are old.

Now in his defense my boyfriend is messy. I’m talking about having the same sock lying around in the same corner for months. I left a water bottle on his coffee table one Sunday only to come back the next Friday and the water bottle was in the same spot.

Disclaimer : sorry for the long paragraph but I have a lot to get out of my chest and I really need some advice.

English is not my first language sorry for the mistakes!


I'm (24F) and my ex, James (24M) were together for three years. We broke up two years ago because I was moving to another country for my studies. The breakup was amicable, we both felt like we had outgrown each other romantically, and we agreed to stay friends.

During the year that followed, we stayed very close. He even came to visit me in the country where I was studying (nothing happened between us), and I truly considered him my best friend and one of the closest people I had in my life. When we were together, and even after we broke up,I was struggling with depression, and he was always there for me, more than anyone else. I’ve always been very grateful for that.

Fast forward to a year ago: I started a new relationship with my current boyfriend, John. By then, I was back in my home country. Shortly after, James and I met for a casual park outing, and I told him everything about John. He seemed supportive and we had a really nice day. But later that evening, he started sending me really aggressive messages, saying I knew how he felt, that I was a bitch for leading him on, and that I had treated him badly. I stayed polite in my responses because I didn’t want to say anything I would later regret, especially since I still valued our relationship deeply. But I felt really hurt. I thought he was being incredibly unfair, especially considering he had dated other people since our breakup, and I had always been supportive when he talked to me about them.

The next day, James sent me a message to apologize but also said he needed space, which I completely understood and respected.

A few months later, he randomly called me. We talked like nothing had happened. He told me he was back on dating apps, had met a few people, and also mentioned that he had messaged one of my friends, Emma (23F), who was living abroad at the time.

Now, just for context: during COVID lockdown, Emma, James, and I were all quarantined together with a group of friends. At that time, James and I were still in a relationship, and I remember feeling insecure about his dynamic with Emma. He had told me he was sexually attracted to her  although he claimed he would never act on it and that he ""just liked her body."" 

Anyway, now they were messaging again, and James shared some of those messages with me,they were explicit, even mentioning me. Apparently, they had fantasized about a threesome involving the three of us. I felt really uncomfortable. He told me he had gotten carried away, that he was feeling lost and sad, and that he was ashamed of it all. He promised he would stop messaging her, and he did.

Over the summer, things went back to normal. He started seeing a new girl, Mary, who I met and really liked. James and I were able to hang out as friends again.

In September, James broke up with Mary for a pretty silly reason, and around the same time, Emma returned to our city. She and I had all of our classes together, and we started reconnecting. One day, she told me that during her conversations with James, he had mistreated her, even though they had both confessed feelings for each other. That was news to me. I hadn’t known they had said ""I love you"" to one another. I felt like James had lied to me.

I didn’t know how to react. It felt disrespectful that they were both telling me about their relationship like I was just some neutral observer, without ever considering how I might feel. I’ve never been someone to get jealous or possessive, and I didn’t want to get in the way if they genuinely had feelings for each other. But over the next few months, they started hooking up,  and both of them would talk to me about how much they hated the other, saying it was just for the sex. I told them I was hurt and uncomfortable. I couldn’t understand why they kept doing this if it was making things so complicated and painful for everyone involved.

From time to time, James would tell me he still had feelings for me and wanted to get back together. It made me uncomfortable and honestly angry, especially because he knew I was in a committed relationship with John. I have always been very honest with John about the whole situation and he has been amazingly supportive and understanding of the whole thing (which is a nice contrast) but I am afraid it his hurting him.

I tried to be supportive with James though, because I didn’t want a repeat of the hurtful things he had said to me back in March. I told him he could take all the space he needed to move on and that if he needed anything, he could call me and I’d be there for him.

Over the last few months, our dynamic has been a rollercoaster: sometimes we’d hang out and everything would feel okay, and then other times he’d either confess his feelings again or lash out at me for how I behave. I eventually told both James and Emma that I didn’t want to hear about their situationship anymore.

As for Emma: I’ve known her for a long time, but we’re very different. I like her, but it’s hard for me to spend too much time with her. She’s very privileged, lives in her own little world, and sometimes it feels like she imposes her vision of who I’m supposed to be onto me, without actually trying to understand who I really am. That stops me from seeing her as a close friend, even though we get along and see each other every day at school.

Last week, Emma became really cold at university. She wouldn’t answer my questions properly and gave no explanation for her behavior. I was annoyed, and I brought it up to James over coffee. That’s when he told me they had a fight. Apparently, she told him she considered him to be a “potential rapist.” He asked her what she meant, and she said it was because of something he had done to me.

During our relationship, I often felt like sex was a chore. I was depressed and emotionally exhausted, and I often felt pressured into it. That was one of the big reasons we eventually broke up. I think I must have told Emma about this back then. So hearing that she used something so deeply personal, something I shared with her in confidence, in her argument with James made me feel totally disrespected. I didn’t say much at the time because I needed time to process.

Since then, I’ve been trying to avoid Emma. I didn’t want to confront her because I hate unnecessary drama. But when we talked for like 20 minutes this week, she had the nerve to ask me why James was mad at her and why he had blocked her — and if I could ask him about it for her. I told her it wasn’t my business.

I’ve been busy with other things, so I hadn’t really been thinking about it. But yesterday I realized that James had also blocked me everywhere. And honestly, I’m angry. Writing all this made me realize just how badly he’s been treating me recently and that maybe having him out of my life is actually the healthiest thing that could happen. I fell betrayed, I feel like he only ever considered me as a potential sexual/romantic partner but never as a friend and a person.  

Still, I’m grieving. I miss the version of him that was once my best friend. When he wasn’t angry or insecure, he was smart, funny, and kind and that’s the part of him I held onto for so long. But now I realize I haven’t seen that version of him in a very long time.

What hurts is that I’ve been blocked with no explanation. I want to understand why. I want closure. Part of me wants to go to his place and ask for it.

Also, I don’t know how to feel about Emma. I can’t help but feel that this all happened because of her and what she said. I know that’s probably unfair, and that James is ultimately responsible for his own actions. But I can’t ignore the lack of empathy and care she’s shown me throughout all of this. I feel angry, hurt, and completely lost. I am more deeply hurt that I thought I would be and can't stop crying and feeling betrayed. 

Thank you for reading me and I would really appreciate some advice on what to do. 


TLDR : I stayed close friends with my ex after our breakup. He started hooking up with my friend, kept sending me mixed signals, told me he still loved me while I was in a new relationship, and now he suddenly blocked me. I feel hurt, betrayed, and lost. Should I cut both of them out of my life. Should I go to his place to ask for an explanation?",2,1742893664.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Name changes and some details left out in case my friend sees this. 
We are both 36 year old females from very different but humble backgrounds.  I am first generation American, my family is conservative and religious. Her family are hippies but also religious at the same time.  I love her family. Since I was a little girl there was always a plate ready for me, and blankets prepared incase I wanted to sleep over. Didn't need to knock on the door. (A time before cellphones kiddos lol). We became friends because we were the black sheep of amongst our peers.  I am a metal head/ country  nerd who likes horror comics sci fi fantasy. She's a bubbly punky girl who likes horror comedy pastel colors and Britney Spears. My family was not happy about my interests, to the point I was getting abused. I was also bullied in school at a time but learned to fight and stand my ground. To set my sights on (who we will call Amy) was a god send.  No one understood me, accepted me, or had any similar interests.  She did! We would hang out at her house since her family were free spirited and supportive about every choice...literally. She decided one day she wasn't going to school anymore when we were 13, and they were supportive of it! We went to different schools so I couldn't protect her from her bullies.  She decided she just wouldn't attend to deal with that issue. I still continued my studies which was difficult. She would be up all night and sleep during the day. But I managed to graduate and went to college.  I would sleep over her house when my mom was having one of her episodes.  She has hypothyroidism and a mental disorder. Picture a moody nun that will whip you if you stray from any path she sets even unrealistic ones. I was not a bad kid. Straight As, homebody, didn't drink or do drugs like everyone else in the neighborhood. But that didn't please her due to my media interests. I do believe in god, but apparently a black shirt means I am a devils worshipper.  She chased me around with a hammer one day and I never went back home. The stories I have with that woman. But this is about Amy. Which is why it was also tiring to be her friend. I love her I do. We never run out of things to talk about but as well can just sit in silence next to each other absolutely happy. However she didn't go to school, she didn't tried to find a job. She didn't help her parents with chores.  It bothered me.  I was a full time student, had a full time job, but would have to come to her house in disarray and do all the cleaning myself. Her parents have autoimmune diseases and needed help here and there, as well as I wanted to show my appreciation.  She wouldn't let me sleep, I had to entertain her since she was sleeping all day. Amy also had a shopping addiction in a house that never throws anything out. Racked up her fathers credit cards because she can't be seen in the same outfit twice. There was porclein animal figurines everywhere and lots of dust collecting objects. This becomes an issue later on because her father cannot retire right now after getting his foot amputated at 65, because he has to pay off her shopping debt. I never said anything to her. I accepted it. I told myself this is just how she is and well, her family is not complaining why would I. I didn't like when my lifestyle was judged and I vowed to never make someone feel the way I did. My solution was to get my own place. She didn't like it. I did try to get her hired in any job I was working at so we can spend more time together.  Even took her with me to my college and she would wait in the hall during class. Then boys started coming into the picture. She would have her honeymoon phase and not be around until they had the first fight and she was my shadow all over again.  If there was a show written about all of her past relationships there would be atleast 10 seasons. One was verbally abusive, told her she  to be bone skinny, she was ugly and isolated her from everyone. Another one was cheating all the time but she liked that he bought her expensive things and vacations. Another one had incestral fantasies of his sister and asked Amy to pretend to be his sister in bed. Second to last one was sexual abusive.  She would settle for these guys thinking well that's all she can get since she didn't have much to offer.  I would cry myself to sleep nights worried for her. I know what you're thinking how can I call myself her best friend and just watch....but sometimes I didn't.   She would cut off anyone who gave her advice and concern. She's the type of person to complain about things but not take any action. Put herself in dangerous situations. Still did not work or get a GED at this point of 30 years old. I didn't want to be cut off. I felt like it's her life, her choices, and as long as we talked everyday I am in the ""know"" and if one of them assaults her I will know in real time and get officers involved. I had to keep quiet because one time I didnt and we didn't speak for 6 months when we were 21 years old. To be informed later on those 6 months she endured pure horror. That made me cry just now. Oh man this is harder than I thought. I am a private person I never spoke about her to anyone like this. I'm a fearcely protective and loyal to her.  What she tells me and does with me stays between us. Which gets our second to last chapter of our life From 28 to 30 years old I felt different about our friendship.  I don't know if it's just maturing, growing apart or what. But something clicked in my head that it's not a healthy friendship.  All these years I had to pick her up from her house or get a cab for her. I had to come to her, she never took intiative to come to my place or meet me at a restaurant when we became adults. Even when she was dating, I had to pick her up from her dates and drop her off home. She loved to get drunk and go to bar in dangerous neighborhoods. She liked being center of attention in the bar around shady characters. I would never be able to finish a drink or relax since I wanted to stay hyperviligiant to protect us. We had our walks atleast. We would walk randomly 5 miles to talk with coffee in one hand and a speaker in the other hand. Dance along the tracks. That never changed in 25 years or watching a horror movie once a week. But that's it.  It's either I watch her drink, walk, watch a movie and have to stitch my mouth together about her choices in men and living situation. She would also post everything on social media. Her dirty room, her drunkenness, what we were doing and where. Not so flattering selfies of us( mid conversation mouth open, eye squinted).  I asked her constantly to not post my pictures.  I would ask her if we can go travel, or do something new, learn a craft. Bake.....something. She would make excuses how all those things could be dangerous and gives her anxiety.   < yea but being drunk in a shady establishment is safe. At this point of my life I was still independent, living alone, and a manager of a business.  I travel often, I have a few hobbies.  I would invite her often, and try to teach her anything I learned but she was disinterested and a little annoyed that I left her side to do these things in the first place. I also am not a big drinker.  Once a month sure let's get some fancy drinks and celebrate we are alive and healthy. But at a reasonable pace. I'm also private and professional on social media. Since I actually work to pay bills I have to keep a clean presence for business opportunities, every job I applied for wanted access to my social media. As well as I don't want my ex or mother to find me.   They are not happy I cut them off and actively seeking for my location even though I have a restraining order on them. (Long story short my ex's new friend had him hooked on a drug that makes him aggressive behind my back. When he came home one night he beat me up as I was sleeping. I kicked him out and he was stalking me to take him back. Even vandalized my jobs store front thus needing a restraining order. My mom didn't like the low contact boundaries I had on her and would hire a p.i to find where I lived. And would send cops to do wellness checks on me forcing me to call her.) That is why I asked Amy to not post things about me or what we were doing in real time since her page is public.  And yes I have been in therapy most of life.  My teachers knew my mom was abusive, they tried their best. Took me out of class to seek hidden counseling, called cps multiple times.  My father divorced her and tried to get me out but in the city we live in mothers get full custody no matter what. My mother threatened him she would unalive me and her if he tried to have a relationship with me. And he left me behind in highschool. That's when I ran away to  Amy's.  I have a great relationship with him now, when I was 18 I actively went searching for him and we talk every day since. However I felt like I had to hide a lot of things my mother and ex was doing to me so he wouldn't end up in prison or have a heart attack worrying about me.  So as an adult I decided to continue therapy after I graduated so I had someone to talk to about these things.  I am weary with new people coming into my life. I never want to make the same mistake twice about any aspect in my life.  Something Amy does not understand.  She lives in a hamster wheel.  No she does not know I feel this way about her.  I feel it's cruel, just because we have different preferences and lifestyles.  Yes I care and love her but she doesn't want to change or feel she is doing anything wrong.  So be it. I decided less contact so things wouldn't bug me. I waited for her to date again 3 years ago and I moved to a different state to start fresh. Until... I started dating someone new. At this time she is dating the ex that wants to role play having romantic relationships with his sister. A dark secret she kept from everyone. We still spoke everyday but I can tell she had her pride walls up.  She wanted to seem well off but I knew something was up. And then I was falling apart too. The guy I was dating was gaslighting me and cheating on me. Took me a while to see it because of a culture clash. The south has a way of sugar coating insults.  Was so confusing since I am from New England.  Amy and I just one day put our pride walls down and called each other crying. We gave each other the courage and pep talk to break up with our partners. She offered me her grandmas apartment whom just passed away. And said she has a job now and there's an opening.  I was dumbfounded. So I flew back to New England moved into the apartment, and had an interview/ immediate hire with her boss.  She worked days and I worked nights, I did that on purpose so our friendship wouldnt effect work ethic and her progress. Things were going great. She missed me so much she was willing to go on a trip with me. Was even interested in learning some of my hobbies. ( the main one is urban exploration photography).  It comes as a shock because it meant she would have to leave the city and get dirty. Be in a new state or country..the complete unknown she was so scared of and yet she wanted to try.  Everything was perfect.  I really needed this in our friendship.  This is why I never cut her off despite of my frustrations. When I'm down in the dirt she's there for me when no one is. Which is why I swallow my frustrations, try a little distance and accept her for who she is. She is there for me in my darkest of times and never judged me.  Things went well until last year. We are in 2025 so 2024. 35 years old. She was not trying traveling with me because she wanted too. I noticed she would stay at the hotel or airbnbs and leave me alone to roam. She would stare at her phone at the restaurants. Only take pictures to post on the gram. But be so turned off after the photo was taken.  I didn't say anything I was just happy I had gotten her out of New England. Baby steps. But then my threshold for dear Amy had hit max.  She would come to the apartment and leave messes,  I would come home from work to parties thrown in the apartment. Random men sleeping in my bed with her next to them. (She lived at home with her parents a mile away but had a spare key.) Leaving me to clean everything. She would leave a lot of things at work for me to clean and fix as well.  She would post pictures I had taken on days she didn't come with me on adventures as if it was her there. Posting music she hates but I love. It was weird.  She was pretending to be me in everyway. Even died her hair the same color.  And then she confessed.  She went on the trips with me and threw the parties to look interesting for a guy she's been crushing on.  She's been lying to him. She would ask me questions about a metal band, things about motorcycles, spooky places to explore, sci fi shows I would watch. All because this guy was into the same things. She manipulated  him (which we would call Dan) and me.   This wasn't the tipping point not yet , almost there Reddit.  It bothered me she pretended to spend time with me so she would have photo opportunities to pretend she's about this life to Dan. But not extremely bothered to mention it to her. She really really liked this guy. And I wanted her happy. Although I don't think lying about your whole personality and interests to win someone over is healthy and well it's an ahole move. Not my place or business though. Welllll it worked. Dan believed her despite her social media only having months into this stuff. Verifying it's very new and same timeline from when they met. But it worked. And she was happy. Truly happy. I was just grateful at this point. Baby steps. She was working and now happy dating someone.  But then she started bringing him over to the apartment.  She told him she was my boss and she felt bad I was homeless and let me sleep on her couch.  ( not my boss and I rent that apartment from her mom, Amy does not live there). She felt embarrassed to say the truth about her living situation, education history, and past experiences and interests. So she lied and said it's her apartment and I'm bumming it there. She asked me to go along with it. And would whisper needing answers to metal and sci fi convos. I tolerated it. Until Dan invited our friends and coworkers over so he can get to know her and he told everyone isn't she so kind to let her unfortunate friend stay on the couch so let's be considerate and not spill drinks where (let's call me Neurin) Neurin sleeps.  And he would sleep over once a week on MY BED. I told her I didn't like that but she had keys to the apartment and would sneak in during my shift at work. Our closest friends thought it was weird everything Dan was saying. Asked ""Amy why does he think this is your place and not Neurins. Why is he talking to Neurin like that. It's like he thinks your her and she's you"". She said just go with it.  But now my coworkers think I'm a bumb in the couch and she got promoted. So one quit the next day because she felt it was unfair that Amy is manager.  My boss was sooooo confused.  I had enough at this point. We had already booked a trip to hike in the canyons six months in advanced and I bought tickets to sleep in a haunted location for the weekend after our hike. So here comes our trip and I'm annoyed trying to separate from her do my own thing.  She didn't notice because she was on the phone with Dan the whole time. He showed his first red flag. Not even a month in and he was jealous and mad she went on this trip. She was crying a little in the middle of the night. I was awoken to sniffles. I caved and consoled her. I tried to make the last 2 days of our trip magical for her. But once we landed they made up.  Then she proceeded to tell me she won't be going to the haunted house with me. She will go with Dan 5 months later. Non refundable 300 dollar tickets.  I was going to use that trip to butter her up and let her know nicely how unhappy I am and think moving back south is a better choice for me. But she bailed. I took another friend and had a blast.  So I tried to meet up with Amy when I got back. She didn't respond. I started house shopping on Zillow to rent.  Found a few within my means. Sent messages. And didn't think about it. I planned to move slowly within 6 months time. But I got an offer and timeline I couldn't refuse. Hopped on a plane to solidify the deal. And flew back to New England next day to pack up my things.  She has was in such a hypnotic honey moon phase that she wouldn't even open messages from anyone. But night before my flight she finally opened her messages. I asked if I can take her to dinner. She said yes Dan is working so she has some free time.  I got us reservations at a fancy restaurant, and told her I'm leaving in an hour for good. She cried and sobbed that everyone was looking at us. I felt so guilty and thought maybe I made a mistake. Maybe I should've tried harder on boundaries and she would've listened. But it was too late. I signed contracts. So I paid for the dinner and went to the airport. She didn't speak to me for 5 months. She messaged me 3 months ago. A huge 5 paragraph message that me moving out felt like a breakup of an era.  And she was mad and felt betrayed/ abandoned. She loved our arrangement and thought we can be like that forever. Her Dan and I.  She had plans.  ( now my eyebrow raised a little) I made a joke saying hey I'm no unicorn or third wheel  ( I use humour when I'm uncomfortable).  And reminded her I tried for a while to let her know but she was busy. And I'm glad for her things are looking up. But i have to find happiness too right? The arrangement was only at her benefit and hurting me. Best friends shouldn't be like that. And if she loved me will will support me and wish me the best.  Amy apologized but it hasn't been the same.  She barely responds. Or ignores my messages and sends me a reel. If she does message me is to say all the things Dans doing for her, what he thinks she should do, his ways about things, etc. I got triggered, but kept my mouth shut incase she shutdowns, and or I'm projecting trauma.  But what I gathered from the little communication we have up until tonight, is a question lingering in my head. ""Where is Amy"". Everything that makes Amy ..AMY is gone. She only does things if Dan approves, only take suggestions if Dan mentions it.  All the things she hates she is doing now because of Dan.  Still I kept shut didn't want to sound like a hater, because she said that to her sister when her sister complained about Dan.  I talked to my therapist and showed her the messages. She said there's not enough to form any opinion.  It could be either or. Either she changed which happens, or she brainwashed herself so she can win him or he's controlling her slowly.  I am intend to agree. It can be any or all of those things. For 25 years she was bubbly, goofy, lazy, likes pink colors, likes pop music, vegetarian, has the same routines, doesn't really leave her house,loves her dog. So happy in her little bubble and likes to invite her friends over to add to her blissful bubble.  To find out from her family and friends that life in New England has changed and a cause for concern.  She's not bubbly, cut everyone off because Dan said so, moving out because Dan wants to. He took over the apartment but doesn't like it's so close to her parents and they have keys.  Told her to quit her job and just be with him24/7.  He works on a laptop. She doesn't go anywhere without him. She hasn't seen her friends but there's pictures of his friends on her gram.   I was getting annoyed with her lack of effort that I muted her. I'm cutting her off without telling her or blocking her.  Just two friends grown apart vibe. I have my own life, with bills and hobbies after all. But something in my gut is saying there's something not natural and healthy about her situation. And maybe dangerous in the future. Soooo AITA for wanting to cut off this friendship? Do you think she changed or is in a toxic relationship? What would you do if you had all this history with someone? (Really sorry about the long post) ",1,1742893622.0,okstorytime,1,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1742893492.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me.

Hey everyone! I’m putting together a small groupchat for people who want to meet new friends and plan fun activities together, coffee, outings, hikes, game nights, or just casual hangouts. No pressure, just a way to be more social and make plans happen

As I’ve seen many people want to socialise more here and I have an idea to make it easier for many of us.

It may come as a surprise that I’m a package deal, belonging to two single celled organisms known as cats, and even worse… *they're ginger*. 

And despite my inclination for the colour black, I don’t have a black cat. Go figure, right? You don’t choose your catly overlords, frankly they choose you. Just like you don’t choose the love of your life, but we can still talk and see if that spark is true? 

I can be described as someone high energy. I love expressing myself in a vast array of colourful words and sentences that make my heart warm. I’d love to find a man who is able to express himself with ease, who is intelligent, witty, and compassionate, with a streak for adventure. 

Because just a few years ago I woke up and discovered a very real problem: I hadn’t seen the Neuschwanstein Castle (real story). And despite currently situating in Germany, I still haven’t. But you get the point. I want to feel at home hiking with you somewhere in the mountains of England as much as I feel at home with you in bed spending the day doing nothing but talking. I want a relationship that other people on the outside can’t quite understand, but matters none to us because we do. 

A few things about me that may be dealbreakers to some: 
I’m blasian
I’m 165cm

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.

1jjf1pz,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1jjf1pz/too_much_drama_long_post/,Too much drama (long post),"Intro: I (f,28) have been with my bf (m,30) for 2 years and we have been living together for 1,5 years. In our culture it‘s normal to marry later in live. We are very committed, want to build a family in a few years and our day to day life is absolutely wonderful. 

My in laws were great at first. However after one year of relationship there was the first big drama. They were mad that I didn‘t wanna join them to a concert. For context: there were many family festivities around that time (like jubilees, birthdays,..) and also concerts that we gave them the tickets to as a present and joint them. So for about 4 weekends consecutevly we have been together. So I didn‘t think that it would be a big deal if I didn‘t join one time. The music was really not my type of music (bf said it was pretty shitty and we have the same taste). I thought it would be fine. It was nothing personal for me and I‘ve already spent so much time with them. At first they also said nothing about this.

Then a week later the explosion happened. Bf‘s sister came around and told us that she had to „take care of the parents“ for the whole weekend. She told us that Bf‘s dad had cried and said that the family is breaking apart (fil later said he never said that btw). That shook me very much and it came totally unexpected to me. When talking to mil and fil it was cleared up that fil cried bc he feared that the relationship between me and them would turn as bad as it is between mil and fil’s parents and that my bf would suffer as much as fil did.
I understood that. Mil however told me many things that to them are „weird“ about me (for example: I was „unthankful“ for them helping us move - i was just stressed like a normal person but I actually literally thanked them and bought pizza for everybody). She said that they don‘t know how to deal with me bc I‘m so different to them. I don‘t know what kind of insecurity this comes from but since this was our first fight I didn‘t think that I am so horribly different to them. 

However I told them that I need time for myself and that I was rushed into the reaaaally close family dynamic. I told them that I thought we should relax a little bit and that I don‘t need to join every single time. For context: they added me to their whatsapp family chat the day that I first met them (in my family your added after the wedding). They wanted me to join on a two week trip to another continent after three months of knowing them (i couldn‘t due to work which they accepted) and they were just constantly showering „us“ with gifts for our new flat (many decorative items that I didn‘t like that much). 

After the talk I had a good feeling about our relationship. I thought boundaries were set and that the severity of the situation was not as bad as it appeared at first („family breaking apart“).
We met a few times and things were fine although I was the ONLY one initiating meetings. I sometimes even baked something for a nice afternoon shared coffee time and everything worked out quite well.

Then after new years eve they told my bf that they have a „new years wish“ (not a thing in our culture btw). They wanted to meet up once a month for the whole next year only in a „small circle“. So without their childrens partners (which at that time was only me).

That hurt me. I have put some effort into this relationship after I was put through some unnecessary drama and they choose to exclude me. They never invited me after the big drama and this explicitly uninviting me was the first time that I truely felt neglected by them. We btw already only met around once per month so I think that they wouldn‘t have started to initiate meetings with me.
 I NEVER had an issue if my bf visited them without me which he sometimes did when I had other plans and he just felt like it. However this just didn‘t happen much lately. That‘s not bc I didn‘t want him to or anything like that. He just enjoyed alone time. Since they later accused me that I don‘t „let“ my bf visit his parents, it is really important for me to stress that I NEVER had anything against that. It was HIM who NEVER wanted to visit them. It‘s so ironic bc it literally was only me who initiated gatherings. 
 
I wish I could have kept my hurt to myself and just enjoyed the peace. But I couldn‘t. Bf called mil (after I had to spend hours to explain to him why I‘m hurt) and told her that them expressing their wish hurt me. She totally exploded and basically said that i‘m just to sensitive and keeping him from visiting them. The next day I got a wall of text saying that they „didn’t mean to exclude me“ and they are hurt by my reaction. They told me that their reason for explicitly uninviting me was that they „love their children and want to know how they are doing“ and that this would be easier to talk about in a smaller circle (wtf. Why would my presence disturb that???).However they also tossed the idea of the monthly meetings. The first one was already arranged though.
Bf said I don‘t need to respond and I didn‘t.
After their first „without partners“-meeting bf came home sad. After I asked him what is going on he said that we need couples counseling bc he is suffering immensly from this situation. That hurt and I questioned weather I will ever be good enough for him and his family. Now - after weeks (!) - bf told me that he had to defend our relationship for 2 hours straight at the „without partners“-meeting. Especially sil was angry that „he let his gf affect the family so much“. She apologized to him afterwards, but I think it‘s just so messed up.

Bf is suffering so much bc he is in the middle. Yesterday he cried his eyes out because of that. But I‘m also very sad and also confused. Why didn‘t he tell me right after they met? Why did he tell me that we need couples counseling (which I actually love and will do) and not tell me about how bad his sister talked about our relationship?

So I last saw my in laws at christmas and this drama happened in the beginning of January.they never contacted me after the „wall of text“ mentioned above. My bf has been to their place a couple of times now when I‘m not around and they hang out. I don‘t wanna join. Nevertheless if I‘m honest I kind of feel „betrayed“ when I see he enjoys seeing them. Even though I‘m happy for him that he still has a good relationship with his family I feel that he doesn‘t seem to have that big of a problem with them treating me this way. He once said that they would like to see me again and that they ask how I‘m doing. I honestly don‘t believe that.

He also wants me to join when they are celebrating his 30th birthday. Since it is a stressfull time for him at work he only wants tp celebrate with his family. It is a milestone birthday and therefore I would like to join. However I can‘t see how this would be a good time for anybody and even though it breaks my heart I think it would be best if I just stayed at home..",1,1742893288.0,inlaws,0,1.0,False

Among the derelictions of this babe of a world twisted by the calamity of that first deluge there were scattered myriad horrors which waited for all of humankind. These mutants were the vilest things. Things beyond civil words. Things which hung on the edges of cliff faces or from the walls of half-remaining ruins or even from the sphincters of their nests, with their twisted backs arched and dirt cluttered mouths retching, and those things caterwauled to the open skies as if to object to their very being. There was an amiss thing in them—the glowing eyes, as well as the fear of incredible light which spurred them to the furthest edges of it. The light did not cause injury, but still it dispersed them.

Though there roamed the lowest rank of demons—those of which with the least of divinity in them—on that mortal globe, below even them, and twisted from the human form to something even lesser than grubs or waste stood the mutant specimen, as it was called. That, the mutant, was the lowest among all things prescribed to live. What wretched existence as that!

There you are fellow traveler, now come and see your fellow traveler and see what’s become of them. You stand on the plains of the westward wasteland, looking out at the dark, intermingling shadows sent by the sun gone, and the trick of your own eyes as full dark, the darkest you’ve ever seen yet, sets. You see a light there among the natural pockets of rocks and desert sand and you creep forward to meet it, to see perhaps if there is a station there for you to rest your weariness for the night.

As you pull your coat around you and spit out the desert’s dust, and begin to lower the brim of your hat in preparation for a slight bow in the direction of whoever set the campfire, whoever there might let you sit among them, and instead you push the hat there on your head back to catch better glances at the man that is no longer a man exactly—he’s become something quite different. His glowering expression sets the hairs on the back of your neck alight, and you stand frozen at this, the worst of human metamorphosis. Here and there, he tears away at the chrysalis of his shell, so he is exposed before you, naked entirely save the ragged shreds of cloth which hang from his waist and shoulders, standing angular like a frightened cat readied to pounce, and he’s cast tall in the light of the fire he must’ve lit himself, probably before what’s become of him.

He’s twisting before your eyes, and only as he coughs and dribble hangs long from his protruding bottom lip, you fully understand the situation; as well as you see him, he knows you are there. His eyes take on the ever-long glow, a thing which continues even once the mutant is put to rest, and even then, can be mushed into a radiating paste and collected if one were so morbidly intrigued—the illuminative properties therein are unknown and possibly magic. You don’t know the intricacies of it.

That mutant, a nameless thing now, lurches toward you, still without its full ambulatory rhythm, so its movements are erratic and like that of a drunk person. It stumbles over its own feet and slams its own fists into its head before twisting great clumps of its own hair around its fingers and ripping it clean from the scalp. It seems to acknowledge the strands locked in its fists with a look of perpetual horror and the lights of its eyes intensify and become yellower like deep sick urine. You stand there frozen as it becomes the other thing entirely.

It kicks across the edges of the campfire and brings up ember sparks which take flight and disappear. The mutant writhes in something resembling pain and falls to its side and swipes in the dirt. Its fingernails rake across its visage as if in protest of its transformation and its throaty hacks shoot mucus down its half-covered chest as it pulls itself to sitting and it looks at you as it reaches to its own eyes and, pinching its upper eyelids between its forefinger and thumb, it rips them free and observes you through its bleeding yellow eyes.

You do what then must be done; you kill the thing and rummage through its gear remaining by the campfire. Perhaps you spend the night and do find some time to rest your eyes.

If you were to put the thing on its back for autopsy, you might see that its organs have liquified even while its brain remains intact. Its skin, whatever color it was before, takes on a pallid expression, and its black veins stand out beneath. Of course, depending on the physician and the place and the time and the demon which turned it, its skin could take on a multitude of different qualities. There is no one that has yet explained the phenomenon.

Mutants, generally, are those zombie-like creatures which humans become whenever they are carnally infected by a demon. Though there are witnesses to the supposed inception, there is no solid documentation. The few demonologists, those which have committed themselves to the study of demons—from afar, as there is no other safe way to do so—seem convinced the disease takes hours for the infected to turn. Few extreme cases indicate days.

So it is that you can speak with one of those fellow travelers of yours in a moment and then be fighting off the rabid advances of a mutant in the next.

Tandy, that cherubic man which Trinity and Hoichi came across—the music instructor which travelled with the Lubbock folks— gave the name Legion to that amalgam mutant that was set ablaze on the outskirts of their travelling camp. Legion, regardless of your feelings on the name, seems also to be brethren to a run-of-the-mill mutant. Whether it be some gross physiology on the parts of several mutants involves, no one knows. But whatever autopsies that have been conducted on Legion have found much the same: liquified organs, but the brains remain, totally independent within the mass—sometimes upwards of twenty.

By their nature and origin, most find mutants particularly disagreeable.

 

\*\*\*

 

Trinity was a good enough shot, and even she herself began to vocalize the fact; it all started when Sibylle taught her how to hold the pistol so that it would not distress her shoulders. Though the hunchback could not level the gun as high as she intended, she could often hit the mark wherever she meant to.

It had been a month and a half since she believed her brother had passed, and the first two weeks had been a miles-long misery. Trinity, upon being returned to Sibylle’s room at Valer Noche, lay wherever and refused to bathe or even speak. Her state would’ve seemed entirely catatonic if it weren’t for the fact that infrequently she would mutter to Sibylle for water or food. She would be brought what she asked for and Sibylle, a perfect stranger, would sit alongside where she lay on the bed or the floor or the small chair at the table in the kitchenette. Always, Sibylle tried coaxing her from her mood, and the hunchback refused.

Sibylle did not say very much, but whispered small words of encouragement, “Let’s go for a walk,” or, “I’m sorry,” or even, “I think we could take you down to the showers for a scrub.” No matter what Sibylle said, Trinity offered only a slight shake of the head and so she was left on her own most of the day and for a good part of the night too.

Sibylle would leave and the hunchback would pull herself to the window in the bedroom, tie the curtains back, and stare out to the city below, her body craned against the sill. The room was on the third story which offered a good enough view of things, and she simply watched people and sometimes chewed at her lip or bit on her knuckles or did nothing at all besides stare.

Often, when Sibylle returned, Trinity was sprawled somewhere else within the room than when she’d left, and Sibylle commented on it indifferently.

Eventually, after much lonely crying and much listlessness, Trinity pulled Sibylle to her and they sat at the table across from one another in the small kitchenette; Sibylle insisted on making coffee first, but Trinity asked her to listen before she did.

Finally, the hunchback spoke, “I did too much. I took too much advantage of you. I know that. For everything you’ve done, you deserve a better explanation.”

Sibylle nodded, shifting in her seat and looking everywhere else besides Trinity’s eyes, “What is there to explain?” she asked, “It’s family.”

Trinity put her hands on the table, twisted her fingers together there and seemed to examine the wrinkles in her hands. “It’s more than that. I’m-we were slaves.” She exhaled and her shoulders relaxed. Her eyes scanned the expression of the woman sitting across from her.

“Mm.”

“That’s it?” asked Trinity.

“I don’t know what else I should say about it.”

“Well,” Trinity sighed again, “It’s a pretty big deal where we came from.”

“Where did you come from?”

“Louisville.”

Sibylle’s eyes darted to lock with Trinity’s, “Really?”

“Ever been?”

“A handful of times, yeah.”

“Then you know they have quite the market for people. There’s a master there—he goes by Salamander Truth, but he tells people to call him Sal or Uncle Sal.”

“I know Uncle Sal. Never met him, but whenever I was in Louisville, there were statues of him in the street.” Sibylle frowned and leaned forward on the table, supporting herself with her elbows upon the surface.

Trinity nodded, as if in recollection, “We—me and Hoichi—were his children. No, don’t look at me like that. He didn’t enslave his own real children. He gave us the last name Truth and kept us among his favorite collection. As far as I know, none of us were related by blood. He taught Hoichi how to juggle and dance and even gave him the clown tattoo on his face.” Trinity offered a sickly smile at this, shaking her head, “He, Uncle Sal, said it was like he had a court jester whenever he wanted one. He taught me how to sing and to read. Tutors anyway. Uncle Sal’s the reason my back’s like this,” she motioned a thumb over her shoulder.

“I’m sorry,” whispered Sibylle.

Trinity shook her head and put up a hand as if to push the acknowledgement away, “It was before I could remember. He dropped me or threw me or something. I don’t know. Anyway,” she took back to rubbing her hands together as she spoke, “We took off, me and Hoichi. We accepted that we’d leave all our other brothers and sisters behind. The two of us could slip away, but if all twenty-three of us tried it, we’d be caught for sure. We told no one else and we disappeared. First, we went to Tuscaloosa; we’d heard it was a refuge for people like us. It was razed to the ground by slavers after we’d been there a month. We thought about heading north, but Hoichi said,” Trinity’s voice cracked, and she swallowed to regain composure, “He said we should go west. I should’ve fought with him about it. We’d be somewhere else completely.”

Sibylle nodded as if to prod her to continue.

“That’s it. We were running. Now he’s dead.” Trinity’s flat tone was divorced from the last sentence as she fluttered blinks then caught Sibylle’s full gaze and they simply stared at one another for seconds. The hunchback fell her mouth open for a moment and let it hang there before going on, “I didn’t spend a moment of my life without Hoichi by my side. Not since I was too little to form any memories. It feels like a piece of myself has been cut off my body.”

Sibylle nodded and swiveled on her chair to plant her legs out sidelong from how she sat on her end of the small table. “I don’t know about that life. A slave’s life. I’ve lost people though.” She nodded. “It’s times like this I wish I had something better to say than sorry.” She shrugged.

Trinity mimicked her sitting and sighed. “You’ve done too much for me. If I had anything to pay you with, I’d give it all to you, Sibylle. I really would.”

“It’s alright. I wouldn’t accept it. Besides, I’m still on contract. There’s no need.”

“I guess I should head north maybe.”

“North? How far?”

“All the way to the North Country. That’s where Hoichi was from, originally.”

“I thought you said you two were raised together?”

Trinity propped her elbows on her knees and sat her chin on her fists before nodding and blinking slowly. “Him and his mother were caught when he was little. He’s only a few years older than me, but whenever I could get him to tell me, he’d mention snow—he said he liked snow. I don’t think I’ve ever seen snow in person. Ash,” she nodded, “So much that it looks like it’s snowing, but never for real. Anyway, he never wanted to go even though he liked snow, but maybe I will. It’s dangerous, but there’s fewer people. Maybe I could find a job shoveling shit in a hut somewhere. Think they’d take me?” She glanced out of the corners of her eyes at the other woman.

“Why don’t you stay here? No one’s come looking for you yet.”

“Here? In Roswell? I don’t know. I’ve seen the posters and what people say. The Republic’s heading west. If they take Roswell into the fold and maintain the rights of slaveholders—which seems likely enough—I’ll pass. I mean, you said yourself they’d come this far in only a few years.”

“Just stay until I catch my giant,” said Sibylle, “I’ve been meaning to go up that way. There’s someplace called Clearwater, and I’d like to see it. They have fewer monsters in the North Country. You know, I come from a place a lot like it. Far east though. Way high on the old American maps. If it’s anything like home, it’ll be cold and quiet. That’s what gets you though, people freeze to death all the time. Or die from the boredom.” Sibylle’s expression was one of satisfaction while her eyes traced the room to recollect.

Trinity trembled and put her hands flat on the table while swiveling back so her legs stood betwixt the table legs on her end. “It wouldn’t—I couldn’t do that. I can’t.”

Sibylle grinned. “Why not?”

“You’re offering to chaperone me,” Trinity shook her head, “I’ve been expecting to you turn me in or toss me out or, or, or,” her voice shriveled.

Sibylle rolled her eyes, “I never liked slavers anyway. And you ain’t been any big burden. I told you; I’m here on contract until I catch me that giant. Besides, I wouldn’t lead you, exactly. We’d go together. You don’t look rich enough to afford a travelling guard, and I don’t really feel like lugging your ass that far all by my own skill. I’ll show you what I know, and we’ll go together. But only after I get my giant.”

Silent tears leaked from Trinity’s eyes, and she swept them away with her knuckles, looking on with an expression of extreme bafflement.

So it was that Sibylle taught Trinity how to use a gun properly. They’d retrieved the old thing from the south office two days after Trinity’s confession while Deputy Doug Fisher was on duty, a pistol which initially mirrored the shape and characteristics of a Ruger, but upon further inspection, the thing carried no stamps and was instead something more newly constructed.

After conversing with Sibylle, Doug turned his attention to Trinity, and he smiled at the hunchback. “It’s alright,” he laughed nervously, “Well, I guess I should say it’s alright as long as you don’t hit me again.”

Trinity had brought her apology to a supplication while the deputy waved it away.

Sibylle walked them through the south gates as the sun stood high and yellow with a bag of old empty cans banging against her leg. The pair of women took off south into the wastes by several field lengths, taking the ancient road with withered metal guideposts which named the path: 285. Then they angled west at Sibylle’s behest, and they found a broad flat ground with differently heightened rocks.

Sibylle lined the cans across the heads of these rocks and then stood alongside the other woman and walked her roughly twenty feet from where the cans were scattered and ordered her to fire.

“What about the noise?” asked the hunchback.

“It’s broad daylight,” said Sibylle, “The mutants are asleep and as long as I’m here, the demons shouldn’t bother us too much.” She grinned, but unburied the crucifix around her collar and let it hang out in front of her jean shirt. Her hand rested lazily across the handle of her revolver.

“You sure?”

Sibylle traced where she’d placed the cans, then glanced back across the berth they’d given the road, then her eyes came back to Trinity, and she shrugged. “Pretty sure.”

Trinity’s tongue pushed her cheeks out as it writhed around inside of her mouth and she leveled herself out, attempted to straighten herself as much as her spine would allow and she closed her right eye end held the loaded pistol out from her body like it was a wild animal; her pink tongue shout from the righthand corner of her mouth; she let go of a big sigh and squeezed the trigger—Sibylle instructed particularly to squeeze and not pull—and the thing reared back in her hands like it meant to smack her in the face and Trinity yelped. Dirt shot from one of the further rocks and once she’d conditioned herself, holding the pistol in one hand, breathing heavily, she looked over to where Sibylle stood and saw that the woman was chuckling.

“Here,” Sibylle approached Trinity and came into the hunchback’s space to stiffen her elbows without locking them and space her legs a bit, guiding her ankles with her own. She stepped back. “Try it.”

She fired again. Another miss. Upon glancing to Sibylle, she merely nodded, so Trinity redoubled her efforts and emptied the clip in the pistol without catching a single can.

They continued this practice for the following week and Trinity’s complaints of sore arms were dismissed by her teacher with, “It’ll get easier.”

It was only when Trinity cleared all the cans that Sibylle suggested they step further back and try again. This repeated in even more days until the pair were far enough away from the cans, that they appeared as specks which blended with the rock that they sat atop; only the sun’s glint off them supposed their position.

“I’m getting pretty good at this, huh?” asked Trinity.

Sibylle nodded. “If all you had to worry about was still cans, you’d be a killer alright.”

Time trickled as it is to do until it’d been a month and a half since the supposed death of Hoichi and the two women took up alongside the road marked 285 and ate thin tamales while sitting in the dirt and watched a caravan line on its way to the Roswell gates. Evening was coming and already the sun was lower, and the sky was purpling.

Around a mouthful of tamale, Sibylle quipped, “We should’ve come out earlier.”

“Where were you this morning?”

“Doug said the giant was spotted west, so I took Puck out for a ride to see what I could see.”

“Aren’t you afraid they’ll revoke their credit? What with you spending time with me?”

Sibylle shook her head, “It was the businesses in Roswell that pooled scratch to hire me first of all. Long as they can say they’ve got someone on the job, the caravans will feel better. There’s been only a few missing people since I started bringing you out here anyway, and I don’t think I could’ve done anything about that. I did find something interesting though,” Sibyle shoved the remainder of her tamale into her mouth and wiped her hands down her jean legs before pinching into her pockets with her forefinger and thumb; she removed a small square photograph of a broad-faced man with a long beard and thick eyebrows across a pointed brow. “Is that the Salamander guy you told me about? Salamader Truth, right?”

Trinity froze and sat her meal on her lap and leaned over to snatch the photo from Sibylle’s outstretched hand. Her eyes traced the face in the square before she handed it back and nodded, “It’s him. How’d you get that? Why do you have that?”

“He’s dead,” Sibylle returned the photo to her pocket and leaned over to a canvas sack—from within she withdrew another cornhusk sheathed tamale. She peeled the husk away and tossed it aside. Through chewing she said, “I thought you might want to know.” She shook her head, “He doesn’t look like any of the statues I saw of him in Louisville, that’s for sure.”

Trinity continued to stare at the other woman with an expression that bordered on incredulity; her eyebrows remained arched, and her mouth took on a half crescent that did not seem at all like a smile.

Sibylle focused on the meal at hand and shrugged, “I thought you’d wanna’ know is all. You know Doug, but the other officers got in news about his passing, and I overhead it. The news came with that photo. Apparently, he was killed about a month ago. Word travels slow, I know.”

“He was killed?”

Sibylle nodded, and pointing with the index finger of her right hand, she traced a line across her throat to imitate the murder. “Apparently, and no one knows whodunnit. Are you alright?”

“I’m okay.”

“Really?”

“I kind of thought I’d want to kill him—or at least that I’d want him dead—but knowing he’s dead,” her shoulders fell, and she gazed at the half-eaten tamale on her lap, “I don’t know. I expected something to happen, but nothing has. Another person’s dead and that’s all there is.”

Sibylle brushed her hands together and laid back on the dirt and took her eyes to the overhead, and it was like she was lost there with her minutes of silence, until she finally spoke, “I’ll get my giant, and we’ll leave. Next time I go out looking for it, you come with.”

She pulled herself up then offered the hunchback a hand and they carried their gear back to Roswell, falling into step with the long caravan line leading through the gates.

 

\*\*\*

 

Upon returning to the room at Valer Noche, they dropped their things on the kitchenette’s narrow counters and Sibylle moved to the bedroom threshold. “It’s hard to keep track, but I think it’s my turn on the bed,” she said.

Entering the bedroom fully, she kicked out of her boots and sat there at the foot of the bed to peel away her socks. Trinity followed and stared at her.

Sibylle pointed to the mess of cushions and blankets they’d piled on the floor which sat alongside the bedframe, “I know it ain’t nothing to write home about, but its better than the street,” said Sibylle, chuckling jovially. Her face sterned, “Sorry, I was only joking.”

Trinity continued to stare at Sibylle there on the bed; the hunchback leaned against the threshold with eyes that both stopped at Sibylle and seemed to go beyond to some further places.

In the strange quiet, Sibylle cocked her head as if in question and Trinity closed the space between them in a blink, planting a firm kiss on the other woman’s mouth. Sibylle’s torso and neck froze, face up—her arms went to Trinity’s and as they parted, Sibylle shook her head, “You have a lot going on right now.”

“No,” said Trinity, “Don’t say that.” She moved in for another kiss and fell onto the other woman.

They lay together in bed, post-coitus, totally nude and idling at the ceiling, studying the ink-art markings of the room.

Trinity quivered and Sibylle reached for her. Through the third-story window, some light from the Valer Noche sign spilled in, adding with its red neon, a blood hue to the room.

Tears ran down Trinity’s face as she shook.

“Hey,” whispered Sibylle, “I’m sorry, alright? I’m sorry. I didn’t want to hurt you. Did I hurt you?”

Trinity shook her head and pulled Sibylle in close to herself—the pair were tangled and twisted beneath the blanket which half-covered them. “No, you didn’t hurt me. Come here.” She kissed Sibylle’s forehead as tears continued to well in her eyes.

They fell to sleep this way, in one another’s arms, and woke only briefly from the heat of it to adjust and put space between themselves, but still Trinity’s hand remained outstretched from her body and planted on Sibylle’s exposed shoulder.

I had everything. LPR, heartburn, reflux, esophagus spasms, asthmas, everything that comes with the disease. test trialed ppis for 2 months and they barely worked so I decided on halloween day I would log a food diary and get serious about doing a Gerd diet. basically took h2 blockers as needed and stuck to no caffeine, no chocolate, low acidic foods, worked well and symptoms reduced by 70%. I even started drinking some energy drinks and low acidic coffee in February but that's where I went wrong. started to do that and had an awful Gerd flareup march 1st from a cold brew coffee I had. I don't know what happened but after this flareup I just was so fucking frustrated because I had been dieting for nearly 6 months and I miss food so bad. I miss good food. I haven't had pizza half of a year, haven't had spicy food in a full year. I miss caffeine the most. fuck this disease. I basically decided to go against my Gerd diet. still remained on low acidic diet 80% of the time but reintroduced caffeine which is literally what I struggled the hardest to quit. drank a shit ton of Diet Coke and zero sugar Dr Pepper. ate fast food about 5 times this month which is the most id eaten fast food in 6 months. reflux was manageable but my reflux got so bad a week ago I had to get back on ppis which I hadn't done since December so yeah unfortunate. so now im sitting in bed in a lot of pain, reflux so bad ppis are barely working, 95% of symptoms are back but cant say I regret a thing because no one talks about how depressing life is when you cant eat or drink anything you like. I only basically drank water for 6 months. I just found stevia water flavored droplets that are finally Gerd friendly but its like fuck I hate this fucking disease, im thankful a lot of my health problems were just silent severe Gerd but at the same time sometimes I just feel so depressed and now after my almost month long cheat diet im feeling sad because now I post toned my healing process. id honestly rather eat plain though and feel better so at the same time even though I don't regret anything I feel a lot more healthier and better on my Gerd diet. so anyways thanks for coming to my ted talk",3,1742893148.0,GERD,8,1.0,False

Among the derelictions of this babe of a world twisted by the calamity of that first deluge there were scattered myriad horrors which waited for all of humankind. These mutants were the vilest things. Things beyond civil words. Things which hung on the edges of cliff faces or from the walls of half-remaining ruins or even from the sphincters of their nests, with their twisted backs arched and dirt cluttered mouths retching, and those things caterwauled to the open skies as if to object to their very being. There was an amiss thing in them—the glowing eyes, as well as the fear of incredible light which spurred them to the furthest edges of it. The light did not cause injury, but still it dispersed them.

Though there roamed the lowest rank of demons—those of which with the least of divinity in them—on that mortal globe, below even them, and twisted from the human form to something even lesser than grubs or waste stood the mutant specimen, as it was called. That, the mutant, was the lowest among all things prescribed to live. What wretched existence as that!

There you are fellow traveler, now come and see your fellow traveler and see what’s become of them. You stand on the plains of the westward wasteland, looking out at the dark, intermingling shadows sent by the sun gone, and the trick of your own eyes as full dark, the darkest you’ve ever seen yet, sets. You see a light there among the natural pockets of rocks and desert sand and you creep forward to meet it, to see perhaps if there is a station there for you to rest your weariness for the night.

As you pull your coat around you and spit out the desert’s dust, and begin to lower the brim of your hat in preparation for a slight bow in the direction of whoever set the campfire, whoever there might let you sit among them, and instead you push the hat there on your head back to catch better glances at the man that is no longer a man exactly—he’s become something quite different. His glowering expression sets the hairs on the back of your neck alight, and you stand frozen at this, the worst of human metamorphosis. Here and there, he tears away at the chrysalis of his shell, so he is exposed before you, naked entirely save the ragged shreds of cloth which hang from his waist and shoulders, standing angular like a frightened cat readied to pounce, and he’s cast tall in the light of the fire he must’ve lit himself, probably before what’s become of him.

He’s twisting before your eyes, and only as he coughs and dribble hangs long from his protruding bottom lip, you fully understand the situation; as well as you see him, he knows you are there. His eyes take on the ever-long glow, a thing which continues even once the mutant is put to rest, and even then, can be mushed into a radiating paste and collected if one were so morbidly intrigued—the illuminative properties therein are unknown and possibly magic. You don’t know the intricacies of it.

That mutant, a nameless thing now, lurches toward you, still without its full ambulatory rhythm, so its movements are erratic and like that of a drunk person. It stumbles over its own feet and slams its own fists into its head before twisting great clumps of its own hair around its fingers and ripping it clean from the scalp. It seems to acknowledge the strands locked in its fists with a look of perpetual horror and the lights of its eyes intensify and become yellower like deep sick urine. You stand there frozen as it becomes the other thing entirely.

It kicks across the edges of the campfire and brings up ember sparks which take flight and disappear. The mutant writhes in something resembling pain and falls to its side and swipes in the dirt. Its fingernails rake across its visage as if in protest of its transformation and its throaty hacks shoot mucus down its half-covered chest as it pulls itself to sitting and it looks at you as it reaches to its own eyes and, pinching its upper eyelids between its forefinger and thumb, it rips them free and observes you through its bleeding yellow eyes.

You do what then must be done; you kill the thing and rummage through its gear remaining by the campfire. Perhaps you spend the night and do find some time to rest your eyes.

If you were to put the thing on its back for autopsy, you might see that its organs have liquified even while its brain remains intact. Its skin, whatever color it was before, takes on a pallid expression, and its black veins stand out beneath. Of course, depending on the physician and the place and the time and the demon which turned it, its skin could take on a multitude of different qualities. There is no one that has yet explained the phenomenon.

Mutants, generally, are those zombie-like creatures which humans become whenever they are carnally infected by a demon. Though there are witnesses to the supposed inception, there is no solid documentation. The few demonologists, those which have committed themselves to the study of demons—from afar, as there is no other safe way to do so—seem convinced the disease takes hours for the infected to turn. Few extreme cases indicate days.

So it is that you can speak with one of those fellow travelers of yours in a moment and then be fighting off the rabid advances of a mutant in the next.

Tandy, that cherubic man which Trinity and Hoichi came across—the music instructor which travelled with the Lubbock folks— gave the name Legion to that amalgam mutant that was set ablaze on the outskirts of their travelling camp. Legion, regardless of your feelings on the name, seems also to be brethren to a run-of-the-mill mutant. Whether it be some gross physiology on the parts of several mutants involves, no one knows. But whatever autopsies that have been conducted on Legion have found much the same: liquified organs, but the brains remain, totally independent within the mass—sometimes upwards of twenty.

By their nature and origin, most find mutants particularly disagreeable.

 

\*\*\*

 

Trinity was a good enough shot, and even she herself began to vocalize the fact; it all started when Sibylle taught her how to hold the pistol so that it would not distress her shoulders. Though the hunchback could not level the gun as high as she intended, she could often hit the mark wherever she meant to.

It had been a month and a half since she believed her brother had passed, and the first two weeks had been a miles-long misery. Trinity, upon being returned to Sibylle’s room at Valer Noche, lay wherever and refused to bathe or even speak. Her state would’ve seemed entirely catatonic if it weren’t for the fact that infrequently she would mutter to Sibylle for water or food. She would be brought what she asked for and Sibylle, a perfect stranger, would sit alongside where she lay on the bed or the floor or the small chair at the table in the kitchenette. Always, Sibylle tried coaxing her from her mood, and the hunchback refused.

Sibylle did not say very much, but whispered small words of encouragement, “Let’s go for a walk,” or, “I’m sorry,” or even, “I think we could take you down to the showers for a scrub.” No matter what Sibylle said, Trinity offered only a slight shake of the head and so she was left on her own most of the day and for a good part of the night too.

Sibylle would leave and the hunchback would pull herself to the window in the bedroom, tie the curtains back, and stare out to the city below, her body craned against the sill. The room was on the third story which offered a good enough view of things, and she simply watched people and sometimes chewed at her lip or bit on her knuckles or did nothing at all besides stare.

Often, when Sibylle returned, Trinity was sprawled somewhere else within the room than when she’d left, and Sibylle commented on it indifferently.

Eventually, after much lonely crying and much listlessness, Trinity pulled Sibylle to her and they sat at the table across from one another in the small kitchenette; Sibylle insisted on making coffee first, but Trinity asked her to listen before she did.

Finally, the hunchback spoke, “I did too much. I took too much advantage of you. I know that. For everything you’ve done, you deserve a better explanation.”

Sibylle nodded, shifting in her seat and looking everywhere else besides Trinity’s eyes, “What is there to explain?” she asked, “It’s family.”

Trinity put her hands on the table, twisted her fingers together there and seemed to examine the wrinkles in her hands. “It’s more than that. I’m-we were slaves.” She exhaled and her shoulders relaxed. Her eyes scanned the expression of the woman sitting across from her.

“Mm.”

“That’s it?” asked Trinity.

“I don’t know what else I should say about it.”

“Well,” Trinity sighed again, “It’s a pretty big deal where we came from.”

“Where did you come from?”

“Louisville.”

Sibylle’s eyes darted to lock with Trinity’s, “Really?”

“Ever been?”

“A handful of times, yeah.”

“Then you know they have quite the market for people. There’s a master there—he goes by Salamander Truth, but he tells people to call him Sal or Uncle Sal.”

“I know Uncle Sal. Never met him, but whenever I was in Louisville, there were statues of him in the street.” Sibylle frowned and leaned forward on the table, supporting herself with her elbows upon the surface.

Trinity nodded, as if in recollection, “We—me and Hoichi—were his children. No, don’t look at me like that. He didn’t enslave his own real children. He gave us the last name Truth and kept us among his favorite collection. As far as I know, none of us were related by blood. He taught Hoichi how to juggle and dance and even gave him the clown tattoo on his face.” Trinity offered a sickly smile at this, shaking her head, “He, Uncle Sal, said it was like he had a court jester whenever he wanted one. He taught me how to sing and to read. Tutors anyway. Uncle Sal’s the reason my back’s like this,” she motioned a thumb over her shoulder.

“I’m sorry,” whispered Sibylle.

Trinity shook her head and put up a hand as if to push the acknowledgement away, “It was before I could remember. He dropped me or threw me or something. I don’t know. Anyway,” she took back to rubbing her hands together as she spoke, “We took off, me and Hoichi. We accepted that we’d leave all our other brothers and sisters behind. The two of us could slip away, but if all twenty-three of us tried it, we’d be caught for sure. We told no one else and we disappeared. First, we went to Tuscaloosa; we’d heard it was a refuge for people like us. It was razed to the ground by slavers after we’d been there a month. We thought about heading north, but Hoichi said,” Trinity’s voice cracked, and she swallowed to regain composure, “He said we should go west. I should’ve fought with him about it. We’d be somewhere else completely.”

Sibylle nodded as if to prod her to continue.

“That’s it. We were running. Now he’s dead.” Trinity’s flat tone was divorced from the last sentence as she fluttered blinks then caught Sibylle’s full gaze and they simply stared at one another for seconds. The hunchback fell her mouth open for a moment and let it hang there before going on, “I didn’t spend a moment of my life without Hoichi by my side. Not since I was too little to form any memories. It feels like a piece of myself has been cut off my body.”

Sibylle nodded and swiveled on her chair to plant her legs out sidelong from how she sat on her end of the small table. “I don’t know about that life. A slave’s life. I’ve lost people though.” She nodded. “It’s times like this I wish I had something better to say than sorry.” She shrugged.

Trinity mimicked her sitting and sighed. “You’ve done too much for me. If I had anything to pay you with, I’d give it all to you, Sibylle. I really would.”

“It’s alright. I wouldn’t accept it. Besides, I’m still on contract. There’s no need.”

“I guess I should head north maybe.”

“North? How far?”

“All the way to the North Country. That’s where Hoichi was from, originally.”

“I thought you said you two were raised together?”

Trinity propped her elbows on her knees and sat her chin on her fists before nodding and blinking slowly. “Him and his mother were caught when he was little. He’s only a few years older than me, but whenever I could get him to tell me, he’d mention snow—he said he liked snow. I don’t think I’ve ever seen snow in person. Ash,” she nodded, “So much that it looks like it’s snowing, but never for real. Anyway, he never wanted to go even though he liked snow, but maybe I will. It’s dangerous, but there’s fewer people. Maybe I could find a job shoveling shit in a hut somewhere. Think they’d take me?” She glanced out of the corners of her eyes at the other woman.

“Why don’t you stay here? No one’s come looking for you yet.”

“Here? In Roswell? I don’t know. I’ve seen the posters and what people say. The Republic’s heading west. If they take Roswell into the fold and maintain the rights of slaveholders—which seems likely enough—I’ll pass. I mean, you said yourself they’d come this far in only a few years.”

“Just stay until I catch my giant,” said Sibylle, “I’ve been meaning to go up that way. There’s someplace called Clearwater, and I’d like to see it. They have fewer monsters in the North Country. You know, I come from a place a lot like it. Far east though. Way high on the old American maps. If it’s anything like home, it’ll be cold and quiet. That’s what gets you though, people freeze to death all the time. Or die from the boredom.” Sibylle’s expression was one of satisfaction while her eyes traced the room to recollect.

Trinity trembled and put her hands flat on the table while swiveling back so her legs stood betwixt the table legs on her end. “It wouldn’t—I couldn’t do that. I can’t.”

Sibylle grinned. “Why not?”

“You’re offering to chaperone me,” Trinity shook her head, “I’ve been expecting to you turn me in or toss me out or, or, or,” her voice shriveled.

Sibylle rolled her eyes, “I never liked slavers anyway. And you ain’t been any big burden. I told you; I’m here on contract until I catch me that giant. Besides, I wouldn’t lead you, exactly. We’d go together. You don’t look rich enough to afford a travelling guard, and I don’t really feel like lugging your ass that far all by my own skill. I’ll show you what I know, and we’ll go together. But only after I get my giant.”

Silent tears leaked from Trinity’s eyes, and she swept them away with her knuckles, looking on with an expression of extreme bafflement.

So it was that Sibylle taught Trinity how to use a gun properly. They’d retrieved the old thing from the south office two days after Trinity’s confession while Deputy Doug Fisher was on duty, a pistol which initially mirrored the shape and characteristics of a Ruger, but upon further inspection, the thing carried no stamps and was instead something more newly constructed.

After conversing with Sibylle, Doug turned his attention to Trinity, and he smiled at the hunchback. “It’s alright,” he laughed nervously, “Well, I guess I should say it’s alright as long as you don’t hit me again.”

Trinity had brought her apology to a supplication while the deputy waved it away.

Sibylle walked them through the south gates as the sun stood high and yellow with a bag of old empty cans banging against her leg. The pair of women took off south into the wastes by several field lengths, taking the ancient road with withered metal guideposts which named the path: 285. Then they angled west at Sibylle’s behest, and they found a broad flat ground with differently heightened rocks.

Sibylle lined the cans across the heads of these rocks and then stood alongside the other woman and walked her roughly twenty feet from where the cans were scattered and ordered her to fire.

“What about the noise?” asked the hunchback.

“It’s broad daylight,” said Sibylle, “The mutants are asleep and as long as I’m here, the demons shouldn’t bother us too much.” She grinned, but unburied the crucifix around her collar and let it hang out in front of her jean shirt. Her hand rested lazily across the handle of her revolver.

“You sure?”

Sibylle traced where she’d placed the cans, then glanced back across the berth they’d given the road, then her eyes came back to Trinity, and she shrugged. “Pretty sure.”

Trinity’s tongue pushed her cheeks out as it writhed around inside of her mouth and she leveled herself out, attempted to straighten herself as much as her spine would allow and she closed her right eye end held the loaded pistol out from her body like it was a wild animal; her pink tongue shout from the righthand corner of her mouth; she let go of a big sigh and squeezed the trigger—Sibylle instructed particularly to squeeze and not pull—and the thing reared back in her hands like it meant to smack her in the face and Trinity yelped. Dirt shot from one of the further rocks and once she’d conditioned herself, holding the pistol in one hand, breathing heavily, she looked over to where Sibylle stood and saw that the woman was chuckling.

“Here,” Sibylle approached Trinity and came into the hunchback’s space to stiffen her elbows without locking them and space her legs a bit, guiding her ankles with her own. She stepped back. “Try it.”

She fired again. Another miss. Upon glancing to Sibylle, she merely nodded, so Trinity redoubled her efforts and emptied the clip in the pistol without catching a single can.

They continued this practice for the following week and Trinity’s complaints of sore arms were dismissed by her teacher with, “It’ll get easier.”

It was only when Trinity cleared all the cans that Sibylle suggested they step further back and try again. This repeated in even more days until the pair were far enough away from the cans, that they appeared as specks which blended with the rock that they sat atop; only the sun’s glint off them supposed their position.

“I’m getting pretty good at this, huh?” asked Trinity.

Sibylle nodded. “If all you had to worry about was still cans, you’d be a killer alright.”

Time trickled as it is to do until it’d been a month and a half since the supposed death of Hoichi and the two women took up alongside the road marked 285 and ate thin tamales while sitting in the dirt and watched a caravan line on its way to the Roswell gates. Evening was coming and already the sun was lower, and the sky was purpling.

Around a mouthful of tamale, Sibylle quipped, “We should’ve come out earlier.”

“Where were you this morning?”

“Doug said the giant was spotted west, so I took Puck out for a ride to see what I could see.”

“Aren’t you afraid they’ll revoke their credit? What with you spending time with me?”

Sibylle shook her head, “It was the businesses in Roswell that pooled scratch to hire me first of all. Long as they can say they’ve got someone on the job, the caravans will feel better. There’s been only a few missing people since I started bringing you out here anyway, and I don’t think I could’ve done anything about that. I did find something interesting though,” Sibyle shoved the remainder of her tamale into her mouth and wiped her hands down her jean legs before pinching into her pockets with her forefinger and thumb; she removed a small square photograph of a broad-faced man with a long beard and thick eyebrows across a pointed brow. “Is that the Salamander guy you told me about? Salamader Truth, right?”

Trinity froze and sat her meal on her lap and leaned over to snatch the photo from Sibylle’s outstretched hand. Her eyes traced the face in the square before she handed it back and nodded, “It’s him. How’d you get that? Why do you have that?”

“He’s dead,” Sibylle returned the photo to her pocket and leaned over to a canvas sack—from within she withdrew another cornhusk sheathed tamale. She peeled the husk away and tossed it aside. Through chewing she said, “I thought you might want to know.” She shook her head, “He doesn’t look like any of the statues I saw of him in Louisville, that’s for sure.”

Trinity continued to stare at the other woman with an expression that bordered on incredulity; her eyebrows remained arched, and her mouth took on a half crescent that did not seem at all like a smile.

Sibylle focused on the meal at hand and shrugged, “I thought you’d wanna’ know is all. You know Doug, but the other officers got in news about his passing, and I overhead it. The news came with that photo. Apparently, he was killed about a month ago. Word travels slow, I know.”

“He was killed?”

Sibylle nodded, and pointing with the index finger of her right hand, she traced a line across her throat to imitate the murder. “Apparently, and no one knows whodunnit. Are you alright?”

“I’m okay.”

“Really?”

“I kind of thought I’d want to kill him—or at least that I’d want him dead—but knowing he’s dead,” her shoulders fell, and she gazed at the half-eaten tamale on her lap, “I don’t know. I expected something to happen, but nothing has. Another person’s dead and that’s all there is.”

Sibylle brushed her hands together and laid back on the dirt and took her eyes to the overhead, and it was like she was lost there with her minutes of silence, until she finally spoke, “I’ll get my giant, and we’ll leave. Next time I go out looking for it, you come with.”

She pulled herself up then offered the hunchback a hand and they carried their gear back to Roswell, falling into step with the long caravan line leading through the gates.

 

\*\*\*

 

Upon returning to the room at Valer Noche, they dropped their things on the kitchenette’s narrow counters and Sibylle moved to the bedroom threshold. “It’s hard to keep track, but I think it’s my turn on the bed,” she said.

Entering the bedroom fully, she kicked out of her boots and sat there at the foot of the bed to peel away her socks. Trinity followed and stared at her.

Sibylle pointed to the mess of cushions and blankets they’d piled on the floor which sat alongside the bedframe, “I know it ain’t nothing to write home about, but its better than the street,” said Sibylle, chuckling jovially. Her face sterned, “Sorry, I was only joking.”

Trinity continued to stare at Sibylle there on the bed; the hunchback leaned against the threshold with eyes that both stopped at Sibylle and seemed to go beyond to some further places.

In the strange quiet, Sibylle cocked her head as if in question and Trinity closed the space between them in a blink, planting a firm kiss on the other woman’s mouth. Sibylle’s torso and neck froze, face up—her arms went to Trinity’s and as they parted, Sibylle shook her head, “You have a lot going on right now.”

“No,” said Trinity, “Don’t say that.” She moved in for another kiss and fell onto the other woman.

They lay together in bed, post-coitus, totally nude and idling at the ceiling, studying the ink-art markings of the room.

Trinity quivered and Sibylle reached for her. Through the third-story window, some light from the Valer Noche sign spilled in, adding with its red neon, a blood hue to the room.

Tears ran down Trinity’s face as she shook.

“Hey,” whispered Sibylle, “I’m sorry, alright? I’m sorry. I didn’t want to hurt you. Did I hurt you?”

Trinity shook her head and pulled Sibylle in close to herself—the pair were tangled and twisted beneath the blanket which half-covered them. “No, you didn’t hurt me. Come here.” She kissed Sibylle’s forehead as tears continued to well in her eyes.

They fell to sleep this way, in one another’s arms, and woke only briefly from the heat of it to adjust and put space between themselves, but still Trinity’s hand remained outstretched from her body and planted on Sibylle’s exposed shoulder.

Coffee is more than just a morning ritual or an afternoon pick-me-up; it's a scientifically backed metabolism booster. If you're looking for ways to enhance your metabolic rate naturally, coffee might be your best ally. But how does it work? What do experts say about its effectiveness? And how can you maximize its benefits? This guide dives deep into the science of coffee and metabolism, featuring expert insights, real user experiences, and evidence-based information to help you harness the power of coffee for a healthier, more energized life.

# What is Metabolism, and Why Does It Matter?

Metabolism is the process by which your body converts food into energy. It includes all biochemical reactions that keep you alive, from digesting food to maintaining body temperature and repairing cells. Your metabolic rate determines how many calories you burn at rest and during physical activities.

# Factors That Affect Metabolism

Several factors influence your metabolic rate:

·         **Age:** Metabolism slows down with age.

·         **Muscle Mass:** More muscle leads to a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR).

·         **Genetics:** Some people naturally have a faster metabolism.

·         **Diet and Hydration:** The foods and drinks you consume play a crucial role.

·         **Activity Level:** Regular exercise can boost metabolism.

·         **Caffeine Intake:** A well-known metabolism stimulator found in coffee.

# How Coffee Boosts Metabolism: The Science Behind It

Coffee contains several bioactive compounds that enhance metabolic function. The most powerful among them is **caffeine**, a natural stimulant known for its fat-burning properties.

# 1. Caffeine Increases Energy Expenditure

Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, increasing alertness and energy levels. This leads to a rise in thermogenesis (heat production in the body), which helps burn more calories. Studies show that caffeine can increase **resting metabolic rate (RMR) by 3-11%**.

# 2. Enhances Fat Burning

Caffeine boosts the release of **epinephrine (adrenaline)**, signaling fat cells to break down and release stored fat into the bloodstream. This process, called **lipolysis**, helps the body utilize fat as an energy source.

# 3. Improves Physical Performance

A higher metabolic rate means increased energy availability. Caffeine enhances exercise performance by **mobilizing fatty acids**, allowing the body to use fat as fuel, thus sparing glycogen stores for endurance activities.

# 4. Suppresses Appetite (Temporarily)

Caffeine may reduce hunger and increase feelings of fullness by influencing **ghrelin (hunger hormone)** and **leptin (satiety hormone)** levels. While this effect is temporary, it can be beneficial for those trying to manage calorie intake.

# 5. Regulates Blood Sugar and Insulin Levels

Some studies suggest that coffee consumption improves **insulin sensitivity**, reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes and promoting better metabolic health.

# Expert Insights: What the Science and Professionals Say

We reached out to coffee experts and health professionals to get their opinions on how coffee influences metabolism.

# Dr. Andrew Odegaard (Epidemiologist, University of California, Irvine)

""Caffeine can slightly boost metabolism and enhance fat oxidation, but its effects vary by individual. Factors such as genetics, habitual caffeine intake, and overall lifestyle play a major role.""

# Colleen Tewksbury, PhD, MPH, RDN (Senior Research Investigator, Penn Medicine)

""Coffee can stimulate the central nervous system and help burn more calories, but it should not be viewed as a magic weight-loss solution. Sustainable metabolism boosting comes from a balanced diet and exercise.""

# Nutritionist & Coffee Enthusiast Mark Reynolds

""To maximize coffee’s metabolic benefits, drink it black or with minimal additives. Avoid sugar and heavy cream, which can counteract the calorie-burning effects.""

# Real User Experiences: Does Coffee Really Work?

# Sarah M. (35, Fitness Enthusiast)

""I started drinking black coffee before my workouts, and I noticed an increase in endurance and fat loss. My metabolism feels more active throughout the day!""

# James L. (40, Office Worker)

""Switching to plain coffee instead of sugary lattes helped me maintain my weight. It keeps me alert and reduces my afternoon cravings.""

# Emma R. (28, Nutrition Blogger)

""Intermittent fasting with black coffee has been a game-changer for me. I stay full longer, and my metabolism has improved.""

# How to Maximize Coffee’s Metabolic Benefits

# 1. Drink Coffee at the Right Time

·         Best time: **Morning and before workouts** for maximum energy.

·         Avoid late-night caffeine: It can disrupt sleep, which is crucial for a healthy metabolism.

# 2. Choose the Right Type of Coffee

·         **Black coffee:** Zero calories, best for metabolism.

·         **Espresso:** Stronger, more concentrated caffeine content.

·         **Cold Brew:** Smoother and less acidic but still effective.

·         **Bulletproof Coffee:** Coffee with MCT oil and butter can provide a fat-burning boost.

# 3. Avoid High-Calorie Additives

·         Skip sugar and artificial creamers.

·         Opt for **cinnamon, nutmeg, or vanilla extract** for flavor.

·         Use **unsweetened almond or oat milk** instead of heavy cream.

# 4. Pair Coffee with a Healthy Diet

·         Protein-rich foods boost metabolism alongside coffee.

·         Hydrate well to prevent dehydration from caffeine.

·         Include fiber-rich foods for sustained energy release.

# 5. Use Coffee Strategically for Workouts

·         **Drink 30-60 minutes before exercise** for enhanced performance.

·         Coffee can **increase fat oxidation** during cardio workouts.

# Potential Downsides & Precautions

While coffee has many benefits, excessive consumption can lead to:

·         **Caffeine Tolerance:** Over time, the effects of caffeine may decrease.

·         **Sleep Disruptions:** Avoid coffee at least 6 hours before bedtime.

·         **Anxiety & Jitters:** Limit intake if sensitive to caffeine.

·         **Heartburn & Digestive Issues:** Some people experience acid reflux from coffee.

# Recommended Daily Intake

·         **1-3 cups per day** is ideal for most people.

·         Stay below **400 mg of caffeine daily** (about 4 cups) to avoid side effects.

# Conclusion: Is Coffee the Key to a Faster Metabolism?

Yes! Coffee can be a **powerful natural metabolism booster**, helping you burn calories, break down fat, and enhance physical performance. However, it should be part of a **balanced lifestyle** that includes proper nutrition, hydration, and exercise. By consuming coffee strategically and making small tweaks to your diet, you can **maximize its benefits** while avoiding potential drawbacks.

1jjeyv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jjeyv5/my_24f_ex_24m_started_hooking_up_with_my_friend/,My 24F ex 24M started hooking up with my friend 23F and now he has blocked me,"Me (24F), my ex James (24M), and my friend Emma (23F)

Disclaimer : sorry for the long paragraph but I have a lot to get out of my chest and I really need some advice.

English is not my first language sorry for the mistakes!


I'm (24F) and my ex, James (24M) were together for three years. We broke up two years ago because I was moving to another country for my studies. The breakup was amicable, we both felt like we had outgrown each other romantically, and we agreed to stay friends.

During the year that followed, we stayed very close. He even came to visit me in the country where I was studying (nothing happened between us), and I truly considered him my best friend and one of the closest people I had in my life. When we were together, and even after we broke up,I was struggling with depression, and he was always there for me, more than anyone else. I’ve always been very grateful for that.

Fast forward to a year ago: I started a new relationship with my current boyfriend, John. By then, I was back in my home country. Shortly after, James and I met for a casual park outing, and I told him everything about John. He seemed supportive and we had a really nice day. But later that evening, he started sending me really aggressive messages, saying I knew how he felt, that I was a bitch for leading him on, and that I had treated him badly. I stayed polite in my responses because I didn’t want to say anything I would later regret, especially since I still valued our relationship deeply. But I felt really hurt. I thought he was being incredibly unfair, especially considering he had dated other people since our breakup, and I had always been supportive when he talked to me about them.

The next day, James sent me a message to apologize but also said he needed space, which I completely understood and respected.

A few months later, he randomly called me. We talked like nothing had happened. He told me he was back on dating apps, had met a few people, and also mentioned that he had messaged one of my friends, Emma (23F), who was living abroad at the time.

Now, just for context: during COVID lockdown, Emma, James, and I were all quarantined together with a group of friends. At that time, James and I were still in a relationship, and I remember feeling insecure about his dynamic with Emma. He had told me he was sexually attracted to her  although he claimed he would never act on it and that he ""just liked her body."" 

Anyway, now they were messaging again, and James shared some of those messages with me,they were explicit, even mentioning me. Apparently, they had fantasized about a threesome involving the three of us. I felt really uncomfortable. He told me he had gotten carried away, that he was feeling lost and sad, and that he was ashamed of it all. He promised he would stop messaging her, and he did.

Over the summer, things went back to normal. He started seeing a new girl, Mary, who I met and really liked. James and I were able to hang out as friends again.

In September, James broke up with Mary for a pretty silly reason, and around the same time, Emma returned to our city. She and I had all of our classes together, and we started reconnecting. One day, she told me that during her conversations with James, he had mistreated her, even though they had both confessed feelings for each other. That was news to me. I hadn’t known they had said ""I love you"" to one another. I felt like James had lied to me.

I didn’t know how to react. It felt disrespectful that they were both telling me about their relationship like I was just some neutral observer, without ever considering how I might feel. I’ve never been someone to get jealous or possessive, and I didn’t want to get in the way if they genuinely had feelings for each other. But over the next few months, they started hooking up,  and both of them would talk to me about how much they hated the other, saying it was just for the sex. I told them I was hurt and uncomfortable. I couldn’t understand why they kept doing this if it was making things so complicated and painful for everyone involved.

From time to time, James would tell me he still had feelings for me and wanted to get back together. It made me uncomfortable and honestly angry, especially because he knew I was in a committed relationship with John. I have always been very honest with John about the whole situation and he has been amazingly supportive and understanding of the whole thing (which is a nice contrast) but I am afraid it his hurting him.

I tried to be supportive with James though, because I didn’t want a repeat of the hurtful things he had said to me back in March. I told him he could take all the space he needed to move on and that if he needed anything, he could call me and I’d be there for him.

Over the last few months, our dynamic has been a rollercoaster: sometimes we’d hang out and everything would feel okay, and then other times he’d either confess his feelings again or lash out at me for how I behave. I eventually told both James and Emma that I didn’t want to hear about their situationship anymore.

As for Emma: I’ve known her for a long time, but we’re very different. I like her, but it’s hard for me to spend too much time with her. She’s very privileged, lives in her own little world, and sometimes it feels like she imposes her vision of who I’m supposed to be onto me, without actually trying to understand who I really am. That stops me from seeing her as a close friend, even though we get along and see each other every day at school.

Last week, Emma became really cold at university. She wouldn’t answer my questions properly and gave no explanation for her behavior. I was annoyed, and I brought it up to James over coffee. That’s when he told me they had a fight. Apparently, she told him she considered him to be a “potential rapist.” He asked her what she meant, and she said it was because of something he had done to me.

During our relationship, I often felt like sex was a chore. I was depressed and emotionally exhausted, and I often felt pressured into it. That was one of the big reasons we eventually broke up. I think I must have told Emma about this back then. So hearing that she used something so deeply personal, something I shared with her in confidence, in her argument with James made me feel totally disrespected. I didn’t say much at the time because I needed time to process.

Since then, I’ve been trying to avoid Emma. I didn’t want to confront her because I hate unnecessary drama. But when we talked for like 20 minutes this week, she had the nerve to ask me why James was mad at her and why he had blocked her — and if I could ask him about it for her. I told her it wasn’t my business.

I’ve been busy with other things, so I hadn’t really been thinking about it. But yesterday I realized that James had also blocked me everywhere. And honestly, I’m angry. Writing all this made me realize just how badly he’s been treating me recently and that maybe having him out of my life is actually the healthiest thing that could happen. I fell betrayed, I feel like he only ever considered me as a potential sexual/romantic partner but never as a friend and a person.  

Still, I’m grieving. I miss the version of him that was once my best friend. When he wasn’t angry or insecure, he was smart, funny, and kind and that’s the part of him I held onto for so long. But now I realize I haven’t seen that version of him in a very long time.

What hurts is that I’ve been blocked with no explanation. I want to understand why. I want closure. Part of me wants to go to his place and ask for it.

Also, I don’t know how to feel about Emma. I can’t help but feel that this all happened because of her and what she said. I know that’s probably unfair, and that James is ultimately responsible for his own actions. But I can’t ignore the lack of empathy and care she’s shown me throughout all of this. I feel angry, hurt, and completely lost. I am more deeply hurt that I thought I would be and can't stop crying and feeling betrayed. 

Thank you for reading me and I would really appreciate some advice on what to do. 


TLDR : I stayed close friends with my ex after our breakup. He started hooking up with my friend, kept sending me mixed signals, told me he still loved me while I was in a new relationship, and now he suddenly blocked me. I feel hurt, betrayed, and lost. Should I cut both of them out of my life. Should I go to his place to ask for an explanation?",1,1742892932.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

## Tips for Maintaining Your Black Storage Ottoman

To ensure your black storage ottoman remains in pristine condition for years to come,follow these maintenance tips:

*   **Regular Cleaning:** Regularly vacuum or dust your ottoman to remove dirt,dust,and debris. For faux leather or velvet ottomans,use a soft cloth dampened with mild soap and water. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that can damage the material.
*   **Stain Removal:** Promptly address any spills or stains to prevent them from setting into the fabric. Use a clean cloth to blot the stain, working from the outside in. Avoid rubbing the stain, as this can spread it further. For stubborn stains, consider using a specialized stain remover designed for the specific material.
*   **Prevent Fading:** Protect your ottoman from direct sunlight to prevent fading or discoloration. Use curtains or blinds to filter sunlight or position the ottoman away from windows.
*   **Avoid Overloading:** Do not overload the storage compartment, as this can strain the hinges and frame. Distribute weight evenly to prevent sagging or damage.
*   **Protect from Pets:** if you have pets, consider covering your ottoman with a protective cover to prevent scratches, tears, or stains. Regularly trim your pet's nails to minimize the risk of damage.

Once I’m up, I’m up. My brain just won’t shut off knowing at any moment I could have to get up again. 

A little background, I’ve always been a bad sleeper. I need to be in my own bed, white noise, etc. My husband and I actually have always slept in separate rooms so noises don’t wake me. 

Postpartum life has been rough. I had a manic episode that lasted 3 weeks upon returning from the hospital thanks to the sleep deprivation. It was sort of a blast at times but the crash was awful. The postpartum anxiety and depression that followed are just now lifting at 9 weeks thanks to medication changes. 

We were fortunate enough to be able to pay for help at night, but even with that I’d often wake at 3am to sounds of the baby (ear plugs would fall out) and that would be it - I’d be up for the day. I even tried taping the earplugs in with medical tape. 

We recently stopped the night help, my husband felt he could handle nights with the baby sleeping almost 5 hour stretches. But inevitably I hear something and wake. 

I’m typing this at 4:45am and I’ve been awake since 1:37am. And guess what? The baby has been sleeping! I got that sucker back to sleep! But I can’t sleep. 

I also feel panicked at the idea of needing to care for baby before having coffee. I guess I’m very addicted to the caffeine. So I’m sure pumping myself full of coffee in the middle of the night doesn’t help…if I don’t do it though I’ll have a melt down and can’t care for the baby.

I become this night time elf just cleaning and finding things to do in the wee hours of the night while the frickin baby sleeps! What the heck is wrong with me? 

Can anyone relate? How do you turn your brain off on a dime to sleep when baby sleeps? My husband has mastered this mindfulness. How do you endure the caffeine withdrawal while caring for baby late at night? ",3,1742892700.0,newborns,4,0.8,False

Unless it's a gift for someone you hate.,"Oh man...words cannot express what happened to me after eating these. The Gummi Bear ""Cleanse"". If you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute, enjoy. If you are like the dozens of people that tried my order, RUN!

First of all, for taste I would rate these a 5. So good. Soft, true-to-taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety...I was a happy camper.

BUT (or should I say BUTT), not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose. I had a gastrointestinal experience like nothing I've ever imagined. Cramps, sweating, bloating beyond my worst nightmare. I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was almost like a skip in the park compared to what was going on inside me.

Then came the, uh, flatulence. Heavens to Murgatroyd, the sounds, like trumpets calling the demons back to Hell...the stench, like 1,000 rotten corpses vomited. I couldn't stand to stay in one room for fear of succumbing to my own odors.

But wait; there's more. What came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a coffee straw. I swear my sphincters were screaming. It felt like my delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste. 100% liquid. Flammable liquid. NAPALM. It was actually a bit humorous (for a nanosecond)as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible.

AND IT WENT ON FOR HOURS.

I felt violated when it was over, which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day. There was stuff coming out of me that I ate at my wedding in 2005.

I had FIVE POUNDS of these innocent-looking delicious-tasting HELLBEARS so I told a friend about what happened to me, thinking it HAD to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute, and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions, she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands.

Silly woman. All of the same for her, and a phone call from her while on the toilet (because you kinda end up living in the bathroom for a spell) telling me she really wished she would have listened. I think she was crying.

Her sister was skeptical and suspected that we were exaggerating. She took them to work, since there was still 99% of a 5 pound bag left. She works for a construction company, where there are builders, roofers, house painters, landscapers, etc. Lots of people who generally have limited access to toilets on a given day. I can't imagine where all of those poor men (and women) pooped that day. I keep envisioning men on roofs, crossing their legs and trying to decide if they can make it down the ladder, or if they should just jump.

If you order these, best of luck to you. And please, don't post a video review during the aftershocks.

PS: When I ordered these, the warnings and disclaimers and legalese were NOT posted. I'm not a moron. Also, not sure why so many people assume I'm a man. I am a woman. We poop too. Of course, our poop sparkles and smells like a walk in a meadow of wildflowers. Thanks for all the great comments. I've been enjoying reading them and so glad that the horror show I experienced from snacking on these has at least made some people smile. ",1,1742892548.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False

Why would anyone want to go the company after they got rejected to drink a coffee with the hiring team while being told all the reasons why they think I’m not good enough? That would make anyone uncomfortable, surely? Why would anyone willing put themselves in that situation?

Theological Disclaimer & Preface

Before we begin this study, I want to provide clarity on the heart, purpose, and theological foundation behind this message to ensure it remains rooted in Scripture and avoids confusion or misinterpretation.

This study is built on the belief that:
	•	Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church (Colossians 1:18), the Author and Finisher of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), and the ultimate model of every ministry role.
	•	Every believer is called by Christ to be His disciple (Luke 9:23) and is commissioned to make disciples of others (Matthew 28:18–20).
	•	As we grow in spiritual maturity and obedience to the Holy Spirit, we begin to reflect Christ more fully in our lives and ministry (Romans 8:29, Ephesians 5:1).

What This Study Is Teaching:
	•	That discipleship is not optional, and every believer is called to engage in making disciples.
	•	That as we mature spiritually, we may find ourselves functioning—not necessarily titled or ordained—in ways that reflect biblical roles such as teacher, evangelist, or shepherd.
	•	That these roles are not about status, position, or authority, but about service, responsibility, and growth in Christlikeness.
	•	That the Holy Spirit is our divine Teacher, equipping and empowering us to walk out the Great Commission (John 14:26, 1 John 2:27).

What This Study Is Not Teaching:
	•	That every believer holds the formal office of pastor, apostle, or evangelist as defined in Ephesians 4:11.
	•	That believers can operate independently from the Body of Christ, church accountability, or godly counsel.
	•	That we are equal to Christ in authority or identity—we are His followers, being conformed into His image, but never replacing Him (Romans 12:3, Philippians 2:5–11).
	•	That gifting or maturity makes anyone superior—spiritual maturity always expresses itself in humility, servanthood, and love.

⸻

In Summary:

This teaching encourages believers to stop viewing ministry as something reserved for the few and start living out their calling as disciples who make disciples. Every believer is empowered by the Holy Spirit to reflect the heart of Christ in their walk, their witness, and their discipleship of others.

Let this study stir boldness, but also humility. Let it inspire action, but always in obedience to the Spirit and in love for the Body. We are not seeking titles—we are seeking Christ, and through Him, we serve others.

——————————————

here’s a comprehensive Bible study that delves into how, as disciples maturing in faith under Christ and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we naturally embody roles such as preacher, shepherd, teacher, and evangelist. This study emphasizes that these roles are integral to fulfilling the Great Commission and growing into the fullness of Christ.

⸻

Bible Study: Disciples Maturing into the Fullness of Christ

Objective:

To understand how maturing as disciples of Christ leads us to naturally embody roles like preacher, shepherd, teacher, and evangelist, fulfilling the Great Commission and reflecting Christ’s fullness.

⸻

1. The Call to Discipleship and Disciple-Making

Scripture Reading:
	•	Matthew 28:18–20
“And Jesus came and said to them, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.’” 

Discussion Points:
	•	Jesus commissions all believers to make disciples, emphasizing teaching and baptizing.
	•	This mandate is universal, applying to all followers of Christ.

⸻

2. Embracing Roles as We Mature in Faith

Scripture Reading:
	•	Ephesians 4:11–13
“And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.”

Discussion Points:
	•	Christ provides various roles to equip believers for ministry and edification.
	•	As we grow, we may find ourselves naturally stepping into these roles to serve others.

⸻

3. The Responsibility to Teach and Guide Others

Scripture Readings:
	•	Hebrews 5:12–14
“For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food, for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child. But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.”
	•	1 Peter 2:2
“Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation.”

Discussion Points:
	•	Spiritual maturity involves moving from receiving basic teachings to imparting deeper truths to others.
	•	Mature believers are called to teach and guide newer believers, nurturing their growth.

⸻

4. Conforming to the Image of Christ

Scripture Reading:
	•	Romans 8:29
“For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.”

Discussion Points:
	•	Our ultimate goal is to reflect Christ’s character and mission.
	•	Jesus embodied all ministry roles; as we grow, we too begin to reflect these roles.

⸻

5. The Holy Spirit’s Role in Our Growth

Scripture Readings:
	•	John 14:26
“But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.”
	•	John 16:13
“When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.”

Discussion Points:
	•	The Holy Spirit teaches, guides, and empowers us for ministry.
	•	Our growth and ability to fulfill these roles depend on His leading.

⸻

6. Christ as the Head of the Church

Scripture Readings:
	•	Colossians 1:18
“And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.”
	•	Ephesians 4:15–16
“Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.”

Discussion Points:
	•	Jesus, as the head, directs and empowers the church.
	•	Our ministries function under His authority and guidance.

⸻

7. Every Believer’s Role in Ministry

Scripture Reading:
	•	1 Peter 2:9
“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.”

Discussion Points:
	•	All believers are part of a royal priesthood, called to proclaim God’s works.
	•	Ministry is not limited to a select few but is the responsibility of every disciple.

⸻

Reflection and Application
	•	Personal Reflection: In which areas do you sense God calling you to grow and serve?
	•	Community Engagement: How can our community support each other in embracing these roles?
	•	Action Steps: Identify one practical way to step into a new role this week, relying on the Holy Spirit’s guidance.


——————————————


 building a Bible study that’s biblically grounded, historically aware, and spiritually freeing—designed to help believers understand what the Church is (and isn’t), why gathering is vital, and how the “how” and “where” of gathering is not rigidly prescribed in the New Testament. This will clarify that we are the Church, and we gather as led by the Spirit, not by tradition or structure.

⸻

Bible Study: “We Are the Church: Gathering Without Walls”

Main Theme:

The Church is not a building or location—it is the Body of Christ. Jesus redefined the temple by making His people the dwelling place of God. While Scripture tells us to gather, it does not restrict how or where we gather. The early church met in homes, publicly, and spontaneously—all under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

⸻

Session Outline:

⸻

1. The Church Is the People, Not the Place

Key Scriptures:
	•	Acts 7:48-50 (Stephen before martyrdom)
“The Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands…”
	•	1 Corinthians 3:16
“Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?”
	•	Ephesians 2:19–22
“You are… being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.”

Discussion Points:
	•	God moved from tabernacle → temple → Christ → believers.
	•	Believers now carry the presence of God into the world.
	•	The Church is not a place we go to; it’s who we are.

⸻

2. What Does “Do Not Forsake the Gathering” Really Mean?

Key Scripture:
	•	Hebrews 10:24–25
“Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some…”

Clarification:
	•	This passage encourages intentional encouragement and spiritual accountability, not attendance at a specific building or service.
	•	Gathering is essential—but not limited to Sunday morning in a sanctuary.

⸻

3. How Did the Early Church Gather?

Key Scriptures:
	•	Acts 2:42–47
“They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers… Day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes…”
	•	Romans 16:5
“Greet also the church in their house.”
	•	Colossians 4:15
“Give my greetings… to Nympha and the church in her house.”

Discussion Points:
	•	Gatherings happened in homes, public spaces, and wherever believers were.
	•	It was fluid, spirit-led, and centered on community and growth.
	•	There was no centralized building or one-time-per-week model.

⸻

4. Where Did “Church Buildings” Come From? (Brief Church History)

Historical Note (Optional Teaching Segment):
	•	Pre-300 AD: Christians met in homes.
	•	313 AD (Edict of Milan): Constantine legalized Christianity.
	•	Post-Constantine: Churches began to look like Roman temples.
	•	Over time, gathering became associated with buildings, hierarchy, and rituals rather than Spirit-led community.

Key Thought:
The New Testament Church was organic, missional, and mobile. The post-Constantine church became institutional, structured, and centralized.

⸻

5. Are Buildings Evil? No. But They’re Not the Mission

Key Thought:
	•	Buildings can be a tool—not the target.
	•	If we confuse the tool for the mission, we lose the purpose.

Helpful Reminder:

“Don’t confuse the tent with the traveler. We’re the travelers—gathering wherever the Spirit leads.”

⸻

6. We’re Called to Go, Not Just Gather

Key Scriptures:
	•	Matthew 28:19-20
“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations…”
	•	Acts 1:8
“You will be my witnesses… to the ends of the earth.”
	•	Luke 10:1-9
Jesus sends disciples two-by-two into homes, not temples.

Discussion Points:
	•	The modern church often emphasizes “come and see” instead of “go and tell.”
	•	The real power of the Church is when it’s sent out, not when it’s boxed in.

⸻

7. What Should Our Gathering Look Like Today?

Key Thought:
Scripture doesn’t prescribe a specific format—but it gives principles:
	•	Teach the Word (2 Tim 4:2)
	•	Fellowship (Acts 2:42)
	•	Pray together (James 5:16)
	•	Break bread (Acts 2:46)
	•	Encourage one another (Hebrews 10:25)
	•	Use spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 12)

That can happen:
	•	In a living room
	•	At a coffee shop
	•	Around a fire pit
	•	At a kitchen table
	•	In a building, park, or field

⸻

Discussion & Reflection Questions:
	1.	What ideas or traditions about “church” do I need to unlearn?
	2.	How can I start gathering more intentionally with other believers—even outside the building?
	3.	Am I a passive churchgoer or an active part of the living Body of Christ?
	4.	How can I help lead or host Spirit-led gatherings in my community?

⸻

Closing Prayer:

“Lord, thank You for making us Your temple. Break down the walls of tradition that keep us from walking in the fullness of what it means to be Your Church. Help us gather in love, go in power, and be led by Your Spirit in all we do. In Jesus’ name, amen.”",1,1742892403.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

Hard Water Filtering for ice machine and dispensing water for brewing tea and coffee.,"Hey all. I've been trying to figure out what system is right for me for the past few months, so here's the sitch.

1. I operate a tea/boba shop within a commissary kitchen, Southern California/ IE, go figure - the tap water is hard and I don't like drinking it.
2. I need this filtration to input from a water line, and output into:
 * commercial ice machine
 * single line faucet in order to fill water tanks with filtered water - to be used in water boilers..
3. a cheap walmart water test strip indicates hard water ~120 ppm, ~25 ppm calcium
4. Usage of filtered water is estimated to be ~35 to 50 gallons per day (from ice machine and water dispensing only)

So, to explain, essentially we run a storefront within a comm kitchen and the waterline that we can use for water filtration and ice in a remote area of the building relative to the storefront, so I can't just hook the filter output up directly to a tea boiler/brewer. 

I'm weighing between multiple systems and I know nothing about water treatment. All I want is for our water is to: taste good, end up being low in TDS for optimal coffee/tea taste, and reduce water hardness.

I'm looking at a few systems through webstaurantstore, there's the oceanlochs, high flows from 3M, everpure, scotsman, scalegard, and the RO systems. How many stages do I need? Do I need an RO system? If RO, how do I protect it from scale? If not RO, some systems have two outlets but one has a scale inhibitor (for ice machine) and the other one doesn't. I feel like I need the scale inhibitor as well for dispensing water too though? So can I split the scale inhibitor output into two lines?

Budget is $500 - $3000, I'm willing to spend money if I need to, but I also understand not needing to spend much money if I don't need to.

I'm happy to run necessary water tests if you all kindly help me out. Thank you for your time!

During the Chinese New Year, I didn’t go home. When relatives asked why, I told them I had a German girlfriend (yes, I made it up on the spot, mostly to avoid further questioning).

Now Golden Week is coming up, and they’re expecting photos. So here’s my humble (and slightly awkward) request:

Is there any kind-hearted non-Asian woman (20–35 years old) based in Tokyo who would be willing to take a few fake ""couple"" selfies with me? Nothing romantic or weird — just a few friendly, natural-looking shots, like we’re on a casual outing.

Of course, I’d treat you to coffee or lunch as a thank-you! ☕🍰

I know this is a strange ask, but it’s really just a temporary workaround to deal with family pressure. If you’ve ever had to hide a part of yourself from family, maybe you understand.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to DM me if you’re open to chatting! 🙏🏳️‍🌈

If you know someone who might be open to helping, feel free to share this post with them!",80,1742891939.0,Tokyo,25,0.77,False

My coffees are free as I have “an account”, as do the office team and other managment.

This is not sitting well with me, I feel like management is drawing a line in the sand and may aswell call all my staff “the help”. 

I won’t take their coffees anymore, and feel like buying a tin out of my own pocket that my dudes can have. 

I feel like I can’t help myself and will contest this at the next meeting. If they can’t afford it they can take it from the money saved on my unpaid overtime.

I dunno man, there’s no point to this really. I just feel defeated for trying hard to create a positive work environment, then to have months of morale stripped with a single email by people who arnt there when we’re 3 functions in and maintaining 150+ service

## Understanding the Different Types of Manual espresso Machines

The world of manual espresso machines isn't a monolithic one. There are several distinct types, each with it's own unique characteristics and advantages:

*   **Lever Espresso Machines:** These are arguably the most iconic and customary type of manual espresso machine. **Lever espresso machines** use a lever-operated piston to force hot water through the coffee grounds. There are two main subtypes:

    *   **Direct Lever Espresso Machines:** With a **direct lever espresso machine**, the user directly controls the pressure applied to the piston. This requires a good amount of physical strength and precise technique, but it also allows for unparalleled control over the extraction process, including the ability to perform **pressure profiling espresso manual**.

    *   **Spring Lever Espresso Machines:** A **spring lever espresso machine** uses a spring-loaded piston. Once the lever is pulled, the spring applies consistent pressure to the water as it passes through the coffee. This type requires less physical strength than a direct lever machine, making it more accessible to a wider range of users while still offering excellent control.

*   **Manual Espresso Presses:** These machines typically use a hand-operated pump or lever to generate pressure and force hot water through the coffee grounds. **Manual espresso press** designs frequently enough prioritize portability and ease of use, making them a popular choice for travel or situations where space is limited. Examples include the Flair Espresso Maker and similar models.

*   **Stovetop Espresso Makers (Moka Pots):** While technically not true espresso machines (they don't produce the same level of pressure), Moka pots are a popular manual coffee-making option that produce a strong, concentrated brew similar to espresso. They operate by using steam pressure to force hot water through coffee grounds.

<div>Eclectic masculine decor is a vibrant and inviting design trend that merges diverse styles and elements, creating a space that reflects individuality and taste. Combining rustic and modern elements often results in a unique aesthetic, appealing to those who appreciate both comfort and sophistication.

The use of rich colors is a hallmark of eclectic masculine decor. Deep blues, charcoals, and earthy tones work harmoniously, providing a warm backdrop that enhances various textures and materials. For instance, pairing a dark-washed wooden coffee table with leather sofas and metallic accents can create a balanced yet dynamic living area.

Incorporating vintage pieces into the decor adds character and history. A classic typewriter, industrial light fixtures, or retro art can serve as conversation starters while enhancing the eclectic vibe. Mixing these vintage elements with contemporary furniture allows homeowners to showcase their personality.

Textiles are essential in creating a cozy atmosphere. Layering different fabrics, such as wool throws, linen cushions, and cotton rugs, contributes to comfort while maintaining distinct style. The choice of patterns—plaid, stripes, or geometric designs—can emphasize the eclectic nature of the decor.

Furthermore, personal artifacts, such as travel souvenirs or framed black-and-white photos, can be selectively displayed to infuse the space with personal stories. Highlighting these items in creative ways, such as gallery walls or shelves, can enhance the overall aesthetic while maintaining functionality.

In essence, eclectic masculine decor is about bold choices and self-expression. It invites individuals to play with design, blending the old and new, ultimately crafting an environment that is both stylish and uniquely personal. Embracing this design style can transform any space into a true reflection of one's identity.

I have been interested in quitting for quite a while, but because of being a young father and the constant full agenda at home its near impossible. For the last 4 days however ive had a stomach virus and non stop puking. Logically when you are sick, the first thing you do is stop drinking coffee (already a red flag as to why to stop in general if you ask me).

I noticed such a huge difference in myself, because im drinking my first coffee now and i right away noticed my brain going to 200%, in a bad way. You think you become more productive and efficient but i would call it monkey brain / all over the place. I will give you one example; audio is my hobby and im always anxiously looking for the next best thing. The last days ive had no such pressure to do so and as soon as im on coffee i feel the urge to go on the internet again. I also noticed an improvement in being present, ive had moments the last days with my daughter that were so great, and i had a feeling she also noticed that i was more focused on her. 

  
just wanted to share that experience, i dont know if anyone else has had this. there is a week coming up that i could really give the quitting a try, i think ill go for it.

There is an excellent summary of what Montecito was/is - especially useful for us Brits - and analysis of the video, making some good points.

""What about that Mona Lisa smile as Gwyneth holds up a coffee mug, jokingly emblazoned with a faux heraldic ‘G’ and ‘B’ (for her and her husband Brad Falchuk)? It surely [pokes fun at Meghan’s calligraphic handwriting, of which she is so proud.](https://archive.ph/o/hWPMs/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14519413/Meghan-Markle-handwritten-note-podcaster-analysis.html)It also lands a gentle blow on the pretension of the ‘M’ beneath a crown – yes, a crown – which heads the personal notepaper used by the Duchess of Sussex, who is no longer a working member of the Royal Family. Gwyneth’s decanting of shop bought biscuits on to a baking tray feels like a tiny swipe at Meghan, too. With Love, Meghan contains a surprisingly large amount of pre-bought goodies, such as peanut butter pretzels. The feelgood soundtrack – This Will Be (An Everlasting Love) by Natalie Cole – was actually used in promos for Meghan’s Netflix show.""

The telling reason that shows there is a coldness towards Meghan is how she has not been invited to anything nor followed by any of these A listers. Boshoff points out ""a very telling episode \[was\] when Gwyneth hosted a dinner at her house for the cashmere brand Loro Piana. It was a ‘celebratory evening dedicated to the art of living well’. Oprah was there, and her best pal TV presenter Gayle King. So too were Sarandos and Avant, Whitney Wolfe Herd and Tracy Robbins. Every single one of those guests became a friend of Meghan – Robbins featured in series one of With Love, Meghan, after all, while Oprah came to her wedding. Yet Meghan wasn’t invited to have rhubarb white negronis with Gwyneth and friends that night.""

It's a decent in depth article for anyone who wants a summary of the relationship - or lack of one!

My boyfriend and I have bought our first home, and we are now trying to figure out what color to paint the living room. We want it to feel cozy and inviting and to give us a sense of relaxation after coming home from work after a long day. I was thinking of a greenish tint, and my boyfriend wants a taupe/beige tint. I also want to paint the side wall to really make the glass bay window pop, but he only wants an accent wall. I have made some designs in Canva, but it's not great with perspective. I have added a couple of pieces of our actual furniture that we will bring (couch + brown recliner chair), while the dining room set, rug, TV console + cabinet, and coffee table are just examples of what it might look like. Could you advise us on what color would work best in this room and whether we should just keep the color as an accent wall or go for both walls? I will post how the room currently looks and my designs. We only get the key on the 16th of May, so we can't really swatch test at the moment. Thank you so much, Reddit!

## Understanding the Appeal of Fully Automatic Espresso Machines

Fully automatic espresso machines, also known as super automatic espresso machines or bean to cup espresso machines, have revolutionized the way people enjoy espresso-based beverages. Unlike semi-automatic or manual machines that require the user to grind the beans, tamp the coffee, and control the brewing process, these machines handle nearly everything automatically. They grind the beans, tamp the grounds, brew the espresso, and even froth the milk (in many models), all with minimal user intervention. This “one touch espresso machine” functionality is what makes them so appealing, especially for those who crave convenience without sacrificing quality.

The convenience factor of a fully automatic espresso machine makes it a welcome addition to any modern kitchen,office breakroom,or even a compact apartment. The ability to create latte and cappuccino beverages at home with the push of a button means not only increased accessibility of the beverages but also savings.

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Fully automatic Espresso Machine

Selecting the right fully automatic espresso machine involves careful consideration of several key features. Understanding these features will empower you to make an informed decision that aligns with your preferences and needs.

**1. Bean Hopper and Water Reservoir Capacity:**

*   **Individual Needs:** For home use, a smaller water reservoir (around 1.5-2 liters) and bean hopper (200-300 grams) might suffice.
*   **Office Environments:** Opt for larger capacities (2+ liter water reservoir,500+ gram bean hopper) to minimize refills.

**2. Grinding Mechanism:**

*   **Burr Grinders:** These are the preferred choice for espresso machines. burr grinders produce consistent particle sizes by grinding between two rotating abrasive surfaces. This uniformity leads to better espresso extraction and flavor.
*   **Ceramic vs. Steel Burrs:** Ceramic burrs are quieter and stay cooler during grinding, but steel burrs are more durable.For longevity, steel burrs are generally recommended unless noise is a primary concern.
*   **Adjustable Grind Settings:** The finer the grind, the more resistance water encounters, leading to a stronger espresso. Look for machines with multiple grind settings to fine-tune your espresso.

**3. Milk Frothing Capabilities:**

*   **Automatic Milk Frothers:** These integrate directly with the machine.They typically draw milk from a container and froth it automatically, delivering perfectly textured milk for lattes and cappuccinos.*   **Manual Steam Wands:** these require some skill to use but offer more control over the frothing process. They're ideal for those who enjoy the hands-on aspect of coffee making or want to experiment with different milk textures.

**4.Programmability and Customization:**

*   **Programmable Settings:** Look for machines that allow you to adjust coffee strength, water temperature, and cup size. Some machines even let you create user profiles to save your preferred settings.
*   **Pre-infusion:** This technique involves briefly wetting the coffee grounds before brewing, wich allows for better extraction and a richer flavor.

**5. Ease of Use and Maintenance:**

*   **Intuitive Controls:** A user-amiable interface is crucial, especially for office environments where multiple users will be operating the machine.
*   **Self Cleaning Espresso Machine:** Many machines have automatic cleaning cycles that simplify maintenance.Descaling reminders and automatic milk system cleaning are also valuable features.
*   **Removable Components:** Easy access to the water reservoir,bean hopper,and drip tray makes cleaning and refilling much easier.**6. Size and Design:**

*   **Countertop Space:** Consider the footprint of the machine and ensure it fits comfortably on your countertop.
*   **Aesthetics:** Choose a machine that complements your kitchen décor.Many models come in various finishes and styles.

**7. Warranty and Support:**

*   **Warranty Length:** A longer warranty indicates the manufacturer's confidence in the product's reliability.
*   **customer Support:** Check for readily available customer support channels, such as phone, email, or online chat.

**8. Budget:**

*   Fully automatic espresso machines range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. Determine your budget beforehand and prioritize features that are most critically important to you.

1jjej40,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1jjej40/tinder_date_in_germany/,Tinder date in Germany,"So I recently signed up on tinder and matched with a woman who lives in my city. We don't speak the same languages so we had basically translated to German by default and texted a whole lot, for around 2 weeks. I asked her to meet earlier but she didn't have time, but that happens. 
By this point, because of all the long exchanges, we know quite a lot about each other and I like this woman and I assumed she liked me, we didn't feel any conflicts or red flags that we both pushed away from each other. 
After the 2 weeks, we met at the city center, went for a walk in a pretty crowded part of the city, explored a few places she liked in the city that we spoke about, got coffee and cake. The whole thing started around noon and ended in the evening. We translated a lot to communicate the whole time, but we always had something nice to say, and we learnt a lot more about each other even considering that we'd be texting like high schoolers. We're 26 and 27 years old. So we end it with a casual hug and part ways on the platform.
After the date, we text, and she says she's really tired for the day and that we text again the next day and has some chores to do, so we don't. Text that day at all, the next day is normal, we text casually. But I'm excited to hear about how the date went and how she felt about it. So I bring up questions about how she felt about the date, and me, what her impressions were and what we should do next. Not all at once ofc. 
Her response was that we'd definitely see each other again and that she thought I was an interesting person.
And later that day she said she has no feelings for me yet and that it's early. She only likes me as a person and not like like me I guess? 
At this point, I'm wondering what this is, I feel like I'm in perplexity if this is gonna workout to be something meaningful, I feel like the first date after all that talk should be enough to catch the vibe of a person and maybe get you excited or not want to see the person. I've never been on a date that ended that ""neutrally"" I guess and I don't feel positive because I'm not gonna wait another 2 weeks to see her, then another 2 weeks. And all this while I want to exclusively date her, I don't see a point in knowing and liking someone and going in dates with 3 other women. But I'm not gonna wait months just for her to know if she even has feelings for me. 

Help me chat. 😩

1jjehv3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjehv3,Expected yield from a 6cup Bialetti moka pot induction,"I recently acquired a 6 cup bialetti moka pot induction and wondering how much brewed coffee should I expect. As for my experience, anything more than 160g comes out bitter and watery but I read somewhere that a 6 cup is generally expected to yield 270g of brewed coffee.

Here's my setup.

- 30g of medium dark roast coffee, pre-grinded for aeropress, pour over or french press.

- pre boil water and fill the chamber just below the valve

- put the pot on the stove at lowest possible heat level.

- stop when the liquid that comes out is very light.

In the first image, that is the coffee that comes out before the liquid becomes light in color. This is very rich  and thick and the taste is not that bitter.

Second image is the coffee before the sputtering phase. This tastes like bitter water.

Third photo is the post brew puck.

Is the grind too thick?

I swear, one of these days, I will yell in the faces of your children to teach them a lesson about being nuissance. I will shove them to the ground if they bump into me and make me spill my drink in public. I will fucking pick a fight with the parents who cannot keep their children on a leash and out of the way of other people.

  
First time: Was  having coffee by myself in a food court near a barbershop in mall. I was scheduled to get a haircut and was waiting for a text that would tell me it was my turn. Brought my steamdeck, and was trying to not mind the group of kids na naghahabulan around the aisle of tables. Tapos biglang what the fuck dinudumog ako ng kids na nakikinood. Pinapatay ko ang steamdeck to make them go away. Tapos their parents decide to sit in the table next to me. Putangina ang ingay pa naman nila, cannot even browse my phone in peace. Ako pa nag adjust at napilitan lumipat.

  
Second time: Having coffee in starbucks - only here kasi convenient waiting area and somewhat decent coffee. Group of parents occupied the table next to mine and the nearby couch. Alam ko na itago ang steamdeck ko if may kids malapit (kairita pa din bakit ako mag-aadjust) and nassense ko na parang tinitingnan na nila. Their kids played roblox naka-party - apparently sobrang intense ng game nila na they started screeching. I can't fucking play my game and they won't even let me finish my coffee in peace. I swear, almost asked the guard para pagsabihan kayo to shut your fucking children up.

  
Third time: Waiting for the elevator and this kid apparently enjoys yelling by himself. Ayaw makinig sa yaya. Keeps screeching some random bullshit. Nung nasa elevator kami, isisigaw niya floor number niya and kept yelling siren noises while the elevator kept going up. Naiirita na din ibang kasabay sa elevator.

  
Can understand why nung bata ako, nahihiya magulang ko para saken. Ang irita ko sa mga bata ay directed din sa magulang who cannot keep them on a leash. Bakit di na nahihiya mga bata sa mga di nila kilala. Sa screen time ba yan nila? Kaya gusto nila makinood sa screen sa devices ng strangers. Di ba sila worried na sasaktan sila stranger na nilapitan nila - kasi one of these days, baka maging ako yun.

Other days, I just want to sit around and do absolutely nothing. If I wait for motivation to magically show up, I’ll be waiting forever.

The only thing that actually helps me for now is getting a daily briefing of what my day entails before it starts. For example I use hero assistant to give me a rundown of my day in the morning. It tells me what’s coming up, what I need to get done, and just hearing it out loud makes me feel like I should *probably* get started.

I've learned from experience that actually taking care of myself, like cutting out alcohol or starting the day with a breakfast and probiotics instead of 2 cups of coffee, greatly improved the chances of NOT developing anxiety that day. (For me anxiety and gastro symptoms are strongly interlinked.)

Even knowing this, sometimes I can't keep up with such basic and normal routines. When this leads to anxiety, it feels like I'm doing it to myself. Once I fall off the wagon, it usually becomes a self-fulfilling cycle where I lose my appetite, get more anxious, it becomes even more difficult to eat regularly or watch what I eat/drink, etc. 

I've been to 3 therapists over the years and neither of them thought I was depressed, at least not to a clinical degree. I definitely feel that way most days, but still. I've tried an SSRI (Lexapro) which actually lead to the aforementioned 5 months of hell lol.

We both are complete opposite personalities . I’m usually very friendly and chatty and he is more work oriented , quiet and introverted . I had no problem with the personality differences - we gelled together hence got married after 2.5 years of relationship . 
However , post marriage I am struggling to be in love with him . As a person I am less organised than he is , so there are fights about this most of the times - we earn almost the same and we are living abroad so he does jobs like paying bills , rent etc . I cook for us and clean - he helps with the cleaning aspect when he can , but refuses to cook even an omelette for some reason . 
I am a person who loves to eat and sometimes I just get so tired of doing all these jobs after my work and just want someone to surprise me one single day with home cooked food . He does the bills and cleaning on weekends - so I find it annoying that I have to cook after my job everyday . To this , his reply is that he has never asked for home cooked food , he is fine with ordering - but I crave for something that is home cooked and I don’t know further how to tackle this . 

Recently I got pregnant and we took a decision to abort as we are not in a mental space to raise a kid now . He has been the same way ever since hearing the news and he asked me yesterday if I’m free to go car viewing on the day I was supposed to get an abortion . It’s draining me mentally how he just cannot expose his soft side / pamper me / lest atleast make me a cup of coffee . Even when I am on my periods there has never been a day when he asked me how I am , but he expects me to baby him completely and feed him when he says he has myalgia ( which he has every other day ) . 

I do agree my pregnancy hormones aren’t helping me a lot - I am lashing out and having wild mood swings - but I just cannot cope like this . I lashed out to him yesterday and said everything I felt and he has been giving me the silent treatment since . He comes off as completely selfish and male chauvinistic to me now and I cannot cope .
