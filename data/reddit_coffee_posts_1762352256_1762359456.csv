1op74nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueGrit/comments/1op74nt/i_went_from_a_dopamine_wreck_to_highly_productive/,I went from a dopamine wreck to highly productive,"I come from a background where I was exposed to hyperstimulation and instant gratification since childhood.

I had a chipped Xbox with 200 games.  
Later I became a porn addict, social media addict, phone addict, and even nicotine addict.

Basically, I trained my brain early to crave the fastest, loudest, most intense stimulation 24/7.

Today, I would honestly classify myself as hyperproductive, because ever since I started my journey of self improvement back when I was 20 (28 now), I have come a long way (do I write a long brag list of all of my accomplishments or will you take my word for it bro?!)

I figured I would share my 3 steps to make dopamine detoxing as potent as possible.

I have boiled it down to 3 points.

**1. Understanding dopamine desensitization**

We all know that feeds, reels, notifications, porn, and basically everything that with a click of a few buttons and minimal effort are supernormal stimuli. They hammer the system that is supposed to make effort feel rewarding. Baseline drops. Reading feels like work, studying feels impossible, even sitting still feels wrong.

We also all know that the solution is to be brutally honest and rip all of those things out like a bandaid. We scorch the earth and let it be for a while so that we can start from zero and build up our dopamine reward system from the ground up.

Meaning, we remove all the BS apps, social medias, the movies, shows and games. Music too. Everything goes out the window. Be brutally honest and just do it. And if it sounds too brutal, then just do it for 3 days and see the difference. If you find yourself going back to the thing then chances are that you are addicted, and then you need a whole differen approach.

**2. Dopamine is relative**

Contrast is everything. If you start the day at a level 10 stimulation, then work at level 3 feels like pain.

Flip it: quiet mornings, no phone on wake, coffee in silence, a few lines of journaling, calm commute. Now effort feels stimulating compared to silence. Work starts to feel good again. Keep at it throughout the day, and cleaning, gym, working on a personal project or just being present feels stimulating.

Understand that the brain compares what you are doing now to what you just did. If you have been scrolling for the past hour, then working on your idea will suck in comparison.

**3. Dopamine loading**

There is a time and place for cheap dopamine. I bought Battlefield 6 last week. BUT, I delay high dopamine rewards for after the low dopamine work is done, and a lot of the days a couple of days after. Because what I have done is link pleasure to real progress. But that does not mean that one hour of video games or a Netflix episode here and there is not fitting in your productive life. It just means that there is a right time and place for it.

BUT, you have to be brutally honest. If you come from a background where you are struggling with say gaming addiction, then maybe aim for a longer period of dopamine system recalibration before you reintroduce dopamine loading.

This is what has worked for me and I find it to be a nice balance between having a dopamine system that is highly functioning and being able to enjoy things in the right way. I talk a bit more about this in my YT video (you can find the pinned post in my profile).",1,1762359285.0,TrueGrit,0,1.0,False

1op728y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1op728y/my_wife_bought_seeds_at_the_farmers_market_now_my/,My wife bought seeds at the farmer's market.  Now my whole town's gone mad.,"My whole town’s gone into a state of mass hypnosis. It started with the tomato seeds.



She got a whole bunch of vegetable seeds, but she talked about the tomato ones the most. 



Apparently, they were the juiciest and most reddish tomatoes she had ever seen. The guy said he got them from a Native American tribe down south. Jokingly warning her how good they are.



My wife planted all the vegetables the day after. Surprisingly, some of them soon grew small roots from the ground, but one rose to dominate above them all. The tomato plant had sprouted, and small tomatoes were growing on it. 



My wife was excited about her gardening achievement. That very night, she picked off the still small tomatoes and put them on toast with some cheese and ham.



 She kept saying how unbelievably delicious they were. Her eyes were rolling back into her head midway through her toast. 



After the first one, she walked back to the tomato plant and picked up the remaining ones. 



Even the ones that definitely didn’t look ripe. 



She knows how bad my acid reflux gets whenever I eat one, but she kept persuading me to at least have a bite. 



I managed to resist. 



The morning after, I woke up early for work. While eating my quick bowl of overnight oats, I looked out into the garden. 



Much to my surprise, the tomato plant had tomatoes growing on it again. This time, they were bigger than yesterday, and there were so many of them. It looked like the plant would crumble under the weight.



I walked out to the garden to look closer at them. I picked one of the plants, but the tomato was strangely greasy with gooey green slime. When I tried to smell them, a foul odor of iron and mold hit my nose.



When I came back from work, I looked out again, and they were all gone. I heard some rumbling in the shed outside. I thought a raccoon had found some trash and was having a feast in our garden shed. 



I walked over, and there was my wife looking for her gardening tools with seeds in her hand.



“What are you doing, honey?”



“Oh, I love how the tomatoes taste! See how fast they grow? I want to plant a couple more of them.”



“Are you sure there’s gonna be space for them? We can barely fit the plants we got there now.”



“It’s okay if there isn’t, I’ll take out the other vegetables and plant them.”



“Oh, but why? I was excited about them, and you know I can’t eat tomatoes.”



“I know, you can’t, but they’re just so good! I know it upsets your stomach, but you should try them.”



“I think a night of stomach acid is not worth it.”



She nodded back, but it looked like what I said went over her head. She started digging through the tools again.



I had a good engineering job at a nearby agricultural company, so my wife was able to stay home and take care of the household. She would usually wake up late, around 8 am. Much later than my usual 6:30 alarm. 



I got dressed up for work and went down into the kitchen. To my surprise, she was already picking the tomatoes in the garden. All the tomato plants sprouted overnight and were overgrown with tomatoes.



“They are magical!” My wife yelled out from the garden. I just nodded my head and started pouring up some coffee.



When I looked back, she was talking to the neighbour and giving him some of the tomatoes from her basket. The basket was already overflowing, but the tomato plants weren’t even halfway picked. I yelled out to her that I’d be on my way to work, and she looked up, waved at me, and got back to her picking. 



Her behaviour seemed strange; she would usually at least give me a hug or even plead with me not to leave the house and stay around for a while. 



Plus, how did all the plants spring up again? The first one grew really fast, but it still seemed believable. How could a plant grow in only 10 hours and have fruit on it? Most of my concerns went away as I got to work and had to focus on other important things.



That day I had to stay at work longer. Some issues with our conveyor belt came up. I tried calling my wife to let her know I'd be coming in late that evening, but she didn’t answer. 



I arrived home at around 8 pm hungry as ever. Excited about my wife's cooking. When I stayed late at work, she would always prepare a meal I enjoyed to cheer me up. 



Walking into the kitchen, I saw my wife sitting at our dinner table, eating tomatoes out of a huge basket. The kitchen looked clean and polished with no food in sight.



“Hi, honey, how are you doing?” I said and sat at the table.



“Good.” She replied. Barely looking at me, and continuing to munch on her tomatoes.



“I tried calling you, saying that I’d be coming late from work, but you didn’t answer.”



“Oh, must have missed it.” She replied coldly.



“Did you cook anything?” 



“No, I didn’t have time.”



“What on earth could you be so busy about? You don’t work.” I said quietly to myself. Not wanting to start an argument.



“Have some tomatoes if you’re hungry, honey.” She said, this time looking up at me with a joyful face.



“You know I can’t have any, my reflux would be crazy.”



“But these are so good. I’m sure the tomatoes wouldn’t hurt you. They wouldn’t do such a thing to you.” She now had a big grin on her face, with her pupils dilated and eyes opened unnaturally wide.



“Never mind.”



When the first basket was finished, she walked out to the backyard to get some more.



To my surprise, the garden already looked way different from the time I left this morning. Not only were all the vegetables gone, but the flowers my wife planted when we first moved in were all plucked out.



When she came back, I tried talking to her again. Asking why she would replace the flowers she loved, but she kept repeating how the tomatoes are so good, and that I need to try them to understand. 



All the stress from work had finally piled up, and made my eyes feel like two heavy bags. I decided there was no talking to her anymore and retreated upstairs. 



Looking from my bedroom window, I could see my neighbours, who my wife had given tomatoes that morning, digging around in their garden.



Like magic, the morning after, all the plants my wife planted yesterday were overgrown with tomatoes again. The backyard now looked like a red ball pit. She was already bringing the first basket in when I was making my morning coffee. She sat at the table and started eating them.



“A nutritious and well-balanced breakfast.” I said, trying to make a joke, but she flashed an angry look. I took my cup of coffee and walked out into the garden to see what was going on there.



“Hey Adam, how are you doing?” I asked my next-door neighbour who I could see standing next to a fence, eating one of the juicy red tomatoes.



“Oh, I’m doing great, Steve. The tomatoes your wife gave us are unbelievable. We planted them yesterday, and they have grown overnight. Have you tried them yet? Your wife told me you haven’t because of some stomach problems.”



“Yeah, I could see you guys digging in the garden yesterday. No, I haven’t tried them. I got a bad case of acid reflux, and tomatoes can ruin my day.”



“Oh, I knew we had to plant when I tried the first one. You need to try them. ” He now had the same manic look my wife flashed me yesterday.



That day's work was slow, which gave me time to think about what was happening at home.



I didn’t want to creep myself out too much, but my wife's behaviour was odd to say the least. 



On my drive home from work, I saw people from my town digging in their gardens. It was the season when people would usually start planting, but why did everyone decide to start today?



Arriving home, I saw my wife and next-door neighbours sitting at our dinner table. We did have good relations with them, but this was the first time they ever came over. 



Everyone was sitting around the table eating the tomatoes and talking about how delicious they were.



No one said hi when I entered, not even my wife. Almost like the tomatoes put them in a state of hypnosis. I said hi to them, but barely anyone seemed to care. Only once I sat down, my neighbour looked at me.



“Come on, neighbour. Still haven’t changed your mind about the tomatoes? Take some, there are a few from my garden there too.”



“I really can’t.” I replied.



“They wouldn’t hurt you, son. Just have a bite.” He tried to push the tomato uncomfortably close to my face. I almost had to slap his hand away. 



The tomato smelled foul. I could see the green gooey slime on the tomato’s skin. My neighbour's fingers were covered with it too. 



After seeing that there was no chance of getting me to eat one, he resorted to munching on it himself and talking to the others at the table. 



I looked out into the garden, and at first I couldn’t believe my eyes. The dirt all over our garden was tilled. I looked over the fence, and my neighbour's garden looked the same.



I tried to walk out onto it to take a closer look, but my wife ran from the table and started dragging me by my arm.



“Stop it, you’re going to hurt them!” She yelled out.



“Jesus Christ, all right, calm down!” I yelled out too. 



She wouldn’t let go of the grip until I walked into the house again. She threw a nasty frown and walked back to the table to her basket of tomatoes. 



Both of my neighbours were looking at me now, too, with a scolding face like parents who learned about your last misdeed.



The morning after, I woke up to a loud banging and rattling like I was next to a construction site. I looked out my window and saw my wife with some of our neighbours taking down the shed in our backyard. 



I hurried out with my pajamas still on, almost tripping on the stairs. I didn’t even put on any shoes. Ran out into the garden and started screaming at everyone to tell me what the hell was going on.



“We’re making room for tomatoes. There’s nowhere else to plant them.” She smiled and looked back at me with a very peaceful expression, like what she said made complete sense.



“What do you mean, make room for the tomatoes?! The garden is filled with them! Where are you going to put all my tools?” I screamed at her.



“They’re in the basement.” She wasn’t smiling anymore.



I ran in front of them, waving my hands above my head, saying they needed to stop and get going. 



Their looks turned from concern to anger. One of the neighbours, Jack, dropped his claw hammer, walked up to me, pushed me, and told me to get lost. 



I couldn’t believe it at first. I stood there for a second with a bewildered look on my face. Then they all dropped their tools and, in almost magical unison, started pushing me and telling me to get away, and that I don’t understand. My wife joined them, too. 



At that point, I retreated into the house. I was panting, my whole body was shaking, and sweat started forming on my lower back. 



I called in sick to work and sat at the dinner table for a while. I had no idea how much time had passed by, and my mind filtered out all the outside noise. 



When my emotions finally calmed down and I came to. They were still working on the shed outside.



I ran back into the bedroom, dressed, and walked out to ask someone for help, but to my dismay, everywhere I looked, people were in their gardens digging up dirt with a basket of tomatoes next to them. 



This happened four days ago. I have not been to work since. Over the weekend, I tried to go to the farmer’s market, but the guy was not there anymore. No matter how hard I looked, he was nowhere to be found. 



People in my town have completely dug up their gardens to plant the tomato plants. The ones who don’t have space anymore have resorted to the same plan my wife had. 



Slowly taking down sheds, patios, fences, fire pits, and all other things taking up space in their yards.



I thought about calling the police, but what was I going to say to them? That some group of avid tomato lovers is tearing up their backyards. 



Reporting the assault is also not an option. I have no witnesses. They’d probably turn it against me.



When they don’t work, they all gather at our house, eat tomatoes, and whisper. 



Nothing else, just whispering and eating the tomatoes. 



I sometimes listen to them whisper the same phrase over and over: “They’re so delicious.”.



Whenever I walk down, they all look at me in unison. Their gaze follows my every move like a shadow.



Edit: I can hear them outside the door now. 



The room is full of the smell of rotten iron.



They’re chanting. 



*“It’s time to try the tomatoes.”*

I was staring at my cat, Loki, today as he expertly knocked my coffee mug off the table for the third time this week. It wasn't anger I felt, but a sudden, clear revelation: this isn't clumsiness, it's a highly specialized skill set. If he were human, he'd be a **Demolition Expert** or a **Quality Assurance Tester** for fragile goods. His precision, consistency, and lack of remorse are truly professional.

This got me thinking about all our pets' unique personalities. My golden retriever, Sunny, who has memorized the exact location of every single toy she's ever buried in the backyard... she's clearly a **Logistics Coordinator** or a **Treasure Hunter**. The focus! The dedication!

**So, I pose the question to all of you: If your pet became human, what job would you assign them based on their current habits and personality?**

**1.The Food-Motivated Pet:** Is your furry friend a master negotiator when it comes to treats? Maybe a **Corporate Negotiator** or a **Food Critic**?

**2.The Couch Potato:** Does your pet have a PhD in relaxation and napping? Perhaps a **Professional Mattress Tester** or a **Wellness Retreat Manager**.

**3.The ""Helper"":** Does your ""helpful"" buddy always get underfoot while you're cooking or cleaning? They've got the makings of a **Project Supervisor** or an **Executive Assistant**.

**4.The Dramatic One:** Does your pet sigh, dramatically flop over, or give you the side-eye for minor inconveniences? The stage is calling! They're a **Method Actor** waiting for their big break.

**Let's have some fun! Tell me about your pet and their dream human career. Pictures of your furry (or scaly or feathery) CEOs-in-training are highly encouraged!**",1,1762359005.0,PawsAndReflection,0,1.0,False

A month ago, prior to my concert ticket purchase, I propositioned an “escort” for some company in the event I pull the trigger on some front row seats to see the master sling words around an auditorium. Am I really going to show up and see NAS empty handed? I think not. What am I some kind of loser that can’t convince a former flame to hop a flight and meet me in the desert? Yes, I am. I have not slayed in a while and the females I knew, well, they have all moved on. I think the appeal here in this situation is that of many of a man, wham-bam and get out. I searched the ins-and-outs of finding the right hooker while posting up inside the desert dome. I will bask in the glory of Vegas and require some candy to chip a tooth on. I google search, how not to get arrested or robbed while propositioning. I read that she, not an object, must be on the social media networks and particularly on OnlyFans. The website where you pay per peak. Find the right honey and she will buzz around you without a pimp lurking the shadows ready to dose your drink with some fentanyl. In the event of not doing your homework, you will swiftly be robbed and left for dead on the casino floor. Tip number three: Keep the cash payment secure in your hotel safe. You got to love the internet, it is a great resource.

Duck drops me under the lights of the thoroughfare where bell hops and door men lead you to a colossal front desk under a decorative, entrancing painted ceiling. It looks like something out of Italy. This is the God damn Pantheon, and the lighting is golden. There is regalness here. Where are my grapes, pillows and fan ladies?  

“Enjoy the rest of your life, Duck.” I collect my things from his trunk. We fist bump and part ways.

“Hello Mr. RZ, welcome to the Palazzo.” Bianca says with a smile.

Bianca is chubby, stout and has the cuteness of a young Costa Rican but she is from EL Salvador. A God forsaken place that has placed bets on Bitcoin being the currency. Home of super-sized, super-max prisons housing the hardest of criminals and gang members. If I were her, I would give thanks every day to her parents for escaping and exiting this land of despair. The cross hanging from her neck lets me know she prays. I get all checked in and ask Bianca…

“If you were me, here and now, where would you go?”

She responds that The Juliette Lounge is nice, and she likes to go there when not working. I make a note so I may meet my streetwalker there tomorrow night.

The room is glorious, twenty-eighth floor, overlooking “The Strip.” I glance down at the seven pools while an electronic motor winds up the sheer curtain. I have a sunken living room, two steps down from the king-size bed where a sectional couch fills the room. There is a peaceful glow radiating from outside. Everything looks so clean from up here, but I am not naïve, I know there is grime down there.

I have been up since three a.m. eager with excitement for the trip but with the time change, my eyes have been open almost twenty-four hours, all whilst slurping numerous glasses of scotch. It is eleven o’clock and it is time for room service to deliver me a stellar steak sandwich from the restaurant below. I consume it in chunks, brush my teeth and fall into my supple mattress adorned with squishy pillows. I fuddle with the remote control, sign-in to Netflix and throw on some Seinfeld. I chuckle into sleep at the sitcom scenarios I have seen thousands of times before.

It is a sunny day in the desert with no clouds in the saturated blue sky that is being compressed and boiled down by some high pressure. It looks like Tiffany and Company blue. Yes, the patented color that virtually all their boxes and bags that contain their products are sold with. I open the privacy curtains revealing what some might call atrocious light. Las Vegas operates fervently at night and the cast of the sun causes things that were once plump, luscious and full of optimism into strife, regret and wilted resignation. The sun pierces and the bums are forced into hiding in alleys, underneath cardboard boxes and the cracks of buildings while just some hours ago, they were ferociously approaching every passerby that is jolting from casino to bar and back asking for a buck.

I search the room for a coffee maker, but the hospitality pros were far too clever for me. When they first broke ground on the Palazzo, one of the first parts of the plan was to have a Starbucks next to the casino, inspiring caffeination before being funneled into the gaming pit. No in-room coffee machine is forcing me from my solitude to mingle amongst the commoners. I head downstairs to find some coffee. Starbucks is perfectly placed at the bottom of the three elevator banks where twenty-four elevators ascend and descend the beautiful tower with a quiet gentleness. For when it arrives at your floor there is no jerky-ness and it feels as if you have been squeezed and deposited between two soft rolls of Charmin toilet paper. The buffered stop, the doors slide open and alas within fifteen steps, the Starbucks awaits where Gen Z employees discuss last night’s WWE wrestling match while building character from working a shitty job. My large, black coffee is served instantaneously, and my bagel is prepared in short order. Two pads of butter and back to my room to make a phone call and send some text messages to my night’s accompaniment. I dial the phone…

Some of you may know me. I’m a video game history researcher and the author of several books, including Through the Moongate: The Story of Richard Garriott, Origin Systems Inc. and Ultima and The Sumerian Game: A Digital Resurrection.

I’ve been working for a long time on a book about LucasArts titled Rebels, Pirates and Tentacles: The Story of LucasArts, which is now close to publication via a [Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1108065491/video-games-stage-3-the-story-of-lucasarts?ref=1pwor9).

The book covers the company’s history—from its origins up to 1990—with particular attention to the people who worked there, the creative side of game design, and the technological side, without leaving out any game. In short: it’s not just about the graphic adventures, but about the entirety of LucasArts’ output.

The book is based on meticulous research and numerous original interviews. It’s not a coffee table book, nor a collection of reviews, trivia, or solutions: it’s a history book—detailed, accurate, and packed with information about the company, what was happening in the video game industry during those years, and the influence LucasArts had on the market.

1op6uon,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1op6uon/to_the_guy_i_escorted_across_the_entirety_of_dam/,"To the guy I escorted across the entirety of Dam, I'm not mad...","I'm just disappointed.

It's 7am, Im drinking my morning coffee before work, I'm too far away to complete my quest so I sat in a bush to look at my map, deciding which extract to take and reset. We must've both just spawned in half way through the raid because you ran straight into me from the nearest spawn.

I could tell you were a bit skittish, but that's alright little buddy, I understand, I've been there. Admittedly, I did hit you with the ""don't shoot"" about 5 feet away from you, causing quite a panic. You flopped and rolled around a bit, but relaxed after my pew-pew emote, and gave me the ""okay"" and followed up with the already classic ""Don't shoot"" ""wanna team up?"" ""Friendly""

Sure. Why not? Im just headed to extract. I'll help you out, I'm not exactly invested in the success of this raid anyways.

I could tell you needed wasp and hornet drivers still after you beelined to each downed arc, so I killed every arc that came near us, looted and dropped every core and driver that you missed, and let you loot containers. You graciously accepted the loot with a ""thank you"" each time, my man.

I'm thinking to myself ""I've adopted a little Timmy, I wish I ran into more guys like myself in 2018 Tarkov, look at him go! Filling up his little bag, so innocent.""

I got you all the way to extract, as you called it in, I walked away and started a supply drop. I looked back to see you heading into the elevator, I was close enough to hear you, and could tell you didn't hit the terminal, but I wasn't worried, so headed towards the freshly landed supply drop.

This was the first container I opened during our 12 minute long adventure. The first opportunity you got, you shot me in the back with ferro and threw 2 impacts at me. Youre sooo sneaky dawg. I knew what was going on, but I didn't even react. I clearly did not have a single item in my bag. I just let you loot everthing we came across. I didn't even take your scraps. I stood still and let you miss your first impact and sipped my coffee while you downed me. You would think with my complete lack of reaction, that whatever I had on me was worthless right? What exactly were you expecting out of this?

I mean this from bottom of my heart, I hope you enjoy my empty backpack, the 30% level 2 Anvil and level 1 Burletta I was carrying, my nearly broken mk.2 looting augment and busted green shield. You clearly needed it more than I did. I was about to sell or deconstruct all of this anyways. I was only questing because I didnt want to do stash management when I got back.

I loaded into my next raid, got some upgrade material, 2 quests done, extracted and headed to work.

If you're reading this, that was the most embarrassing thing I've ever seen topside. I suggest keeping the results of that raid to yourself. Trust your secret is safe with me little bro, I won't tell a soul.",4,1762358673.0,ArcRaiders,7,0.75,False

Hi everyone,I’m a 37-year-old man living in New York City, and the loneliness is eating me alive. In 2015 I was caught in random gang crossfire; a bullet hit me in the ear, severed my spine, and left me quadriplegic—paralyzed from the neck down and hooked to a ventilator 24/7 just to breathe. I can’t move, feed myself, or do anything independently.I have a few family members and friends who visit when they can, and I roll around the facility and outside in my electric wheelchair when weather permits. But those moments are brief and shallow. I’m starving for real-life female companionship—someone in the NYC area who’s kind, patient, and willing to meet face-to-face.We could hang out in the facility’s common areas, grab coffee in the courtyard, or just sit and talk. I’m thoughtful, use dark humor to cope, and love movies, books, music, or any real conversation. Age doesn’t matter; I just need a genuine connection that could grow.If you’re a woman in NYC who can offer empathy and time, please message me. Even one visit could pull me out of this isolation. Thank you for reading—your kindness means everything.(Proof available

1op6u7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1op6u7h/aita_for_defending_my_bestfriend_dropping_my/,"AITA for defending my bestfriend & dropping my friends deceased mother in laws name during argument, which ended in both my best friends husband and son to go no contact with me?","I'm going to apologize in advance as this is going to be long. There's a bit of a backstory to this that you need to know before we get to the title. 

Characters BF= best friend (41F), BFH best friend's husband (42M), BFS= best friends son (21M) and me (44F)

  
This entire saga began when bfh called me to tell me he was leaving my bf and taking the kids. (Que whiplash for me) So I asked what was going on. He told me that things had been really rocky between them (cliff notes version) including her having a inappropriate text conversation with a co-worker, she had begun drinking, not coming home from work things of that nature. The drinking had begun a few months prior and not binge drinking, having one shot of whiskey a night to help her sleep. I asked if he was getting drunk on a daily or near daily basis he said no, she would go through a bottle in a two-three week period of time but was up to two or three shots a night. She told him it was to help her sleep. 

  
This would prob be a good time to give some insight here. BFH had been out of work for over two years, she supported the entire large household by herself, while there were no cuts in spending, take out being ordered, coffee orders things of that nature. She had emotionally shut down a year prior due to depression which I pointed out her hubby as to why she was most likely drinking when he first came to me with it. She had all but stopped talking to me, so the only insight I ever got was from her husband. 

  
Back to the story. After he filled me in on what was going on, the texts while inappropriate it did seem like harmless banter and a bit of deflection on her part. I pointed out that I have had banter like that with my co workers so I really couldn't comment on that. I did say on the surface the coworker was wrong for saying it to begin with and she most likely responded that was as deflection or genuine humor. We did have a discussion as to if leaving was the right decision and if he was jumping the gun or not. He then asked me for my opinion on the entire situation. Before I uttered a word I asked him if he was really sure he wanted to have this conversation with me as he was not going to like it. He said yes, I asked are you sure and again he said yes. We've been friends for over 20 years I thought ok. Being in the same shoes as my BF in the past and being a single income house I pointed out the unspoken stress of being an only income provider, the fact no one was willing to cut back on spending, or when she said no to something they all attacked her, I pointed out the fact he turned down a job that my husband offered him was a slap in the fact to my BF because it may not have been a dream job but it was an income. I did try to put everything delicately. (with exception of the job part that I said bluntly) I asked why would she want to come home when every time she does by your own admittance you argue with her the moment she walked in the door. I asked if she could be possibly sitting in the parking lot just staring into the void like I had done so many times. I pointed out her depression the fact she had shut down completely and asked him honestly how would he handle things if the roles were reversed. I said you all got to this point as a family, I believe my exact words in the conversation were if you're going to make her the villain in your story that's fine but you can't leave out the chapters you wrote getting there.

  
I pretty much knew he didn't take this conversation well because the entire thing felt like an outright attack on my BF and it started to feel toxic and abusive on his part, my feeling was solidified when he told me an outright lie to get me to be angry with my BF. I know her, I know her soul and I know for a fact the comment he made up was a lie. (it actually came out organically where she thought the text messages he was receiving actually came from) This was so unlike him, I don't know what deep rooted issues or insecurities he was going through but I will say he's not the perfect husband but he was always a good man. This entire year was out of character for him. This was a couple I always looked up to and even wished my own husband cared as much as him at times.

  
That part was important so you know what's leading up to the comment I made. Fast forward 2 days later and my BF calls me, broken down crying. We have a long conversation and he changed many of the things I said to him and made it look like I was siding with him. I set the record straight and told her the actual conversation I had. Well she told me some of the deplorable things she was called (enter her son here) told her she deserved the abuse she received as a child and threatened to call CPS to take the two younger children away.  (mind you her own husband admitted she was not an alcoholic or a drunk) This is where I start getting vehemently angry with her son. I'm one of maybe 3 people that knew what actually happened to her as a child and no matter how right he thought his argument may have been that was disgusting and automatically wrong in my book. 

  
Fast forward a few days, we go to one of their kids birthday parties. BF and BFH have started working things out. BFS is refusing to speak to her. My BF stays in her room the entire duration of the party because BFS is there and she doesn't want to ruin her daughters bday because her son will start a fight with her. ( her words) I spend time talking to her and trying to coax her out but she refused. I went out to help cut the cake and talked to the other family members for a little bit. While I'm outside I see BFS whispering to another family member. I zone in listening and hear him telling not only lies but half truths to attempt to get someone else to take up arms against my BF. I stare him down he realizes I'm listening and I tell him knock it off. A few mins later he starts the same thing with two other family members. I go and get BFH and explain what's going on, he does the right thing and puts an end to it immediately. 

  
2 day's later, remember the job my husband offered to BFH? Well BFS actually took it. I get a phone call from a good friend of mine that works for that company. (We all now work in the same industry) Basically asking WTF my nephew's deal was. I was told apparently he was attempting to get 3 people fired, including my husband. (nice thank you for getting him the job right?) I realize immediately the odd question he asked me at the party about the usage of a company vehicle now makes sense. He was fishing for information. During the course of the week 3 other people in that company talk to me reiterating the first friends story. (There was no fights, no reason for him to try to get my husband fired) Wednesday my BF calls me to vent. Her and her son got into another argument because she was paying his car insurance. (remember she's the only income in the house right now) BFS has been employed the entire time, living with her not paying for anything but his gas and things he wants. She asked him to start covering it because she's not making ends meet. He blows up on her calling her some more deplorable names. 

  
So now we are on Saturday, (it's almost over I swear thank you for sticking with me thus far) We are over their house again, same scenario BF wont come out because BFS is there, doesn't want to ruin her other daughters Bday. (they were born a week and a few years apart) I say NOTHING to BFS. I choose not the time nor place but I don't even acknowledge him at this point. I know if I do open my mouth it's going to be horrific. So to preserve the peace I say nothing and spend the night with my BF in her room talking until it's time to leave. (She was in a very dark place at this point) 

  
Come the following week he shows up at my job. (part of his job to be here not a social call) He smiles and asks if I'm going to talk to him now. I excuse myself outside to have a quick conversation. I say that depends, who am I talking to? The loving and kind boy I new growing up or the backstabbing vial person I'm starting to see? He doesn't know at this point that I know about the attempted firing of my husband. I thought his mother was going through enough and kept it to myself. He just says ya I know I'm calling her tonight to make it right. So I say ok that's a start, but honestly what would your grandmother think of you entire behavior right now? You've got a lot to make right not just that. I turned around and walked back inside not capable of not screaming at him in front of my job. She was a saint of a woman that never would have tolerated any of this but passed when BFS was little. 

  
It honestly was meant as a wake up call, which worked. He immediately stopped filling his boss's head with garbage about my husband, apologized to my BF for the way he spoke to her and started making things right with his family. Since my BFH and BFS has gone no contact with me which means I'm sure in the end I'll loose my BF too. 

  
So now BFH has gone no contact with me because I didn't side with him on the whole situation and because of that comment and BFS is no contact for the comment. My BF says I did nothing wrong other than defend her when no one else would and agreed the saintly  MIL would have never tolerated any of this behavior and kicked all their butts hers included. My husband also agrees that I didn't do anything wrong. I was asked for the advice, gave a disclaimer and told to proceed and I only spoke the truth.

1op6u4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanDiegan/comments/1op6u4a/local_penpal_social_experiment_wingpal/,Local pen-pal social experiment! (Wing-pal),"Hi all, this odd little bird is back. With an idea that hopefully will breathe joy and life to those lonely souls in our local community. 
I’m done trying to point the finger at what’s wrong with our city, society, neighbors. I want to be an influence of a positive shift. Small as it may be or as big as it may get. I’d like to jumpstart a local pen pal directory(social network). If this small experiment seems like something people enjoy and find fruitful, a website will be created and then an app. With the necessary technology for age verification and moderations.
 
Why , because I’m lonely , because I don’t know how to properly socialize. I enjoy writing and I enjoy reading, so instead of swiping left or going to a bar I’d like enjoy the pleasure of a conversation, no strings attached, no  expectations . Without judging a person by their appearance , age or gender. The goal would mainly focus on making deep and personal connections, friendships; with people who one day you may be able to meet and then get to know IRL, but before sharing a picture , name or age and especially a phone number and or social media handle with the expectation of meeting the love of your life perhaps you could end up with….a friend or at least someone real with whom you may chat.

So this how it’s going to work: first you create a brand new email. One that may hide your identity as much as possible, this means, no government name, no nicknames or aliases you’ve used or been called both IRL or on the internet, no personal details like your birth year, Example: John1984@gmail.com Once you have the email, you may start typing your email to me at: 
cupid0@proton.me 
The title ought to be a small sentence that briefly describes who you are WITHOUT mentioning , your name and or nicknames/aliases , your age , or your gender!

An example may be “I’m a dove, that flies within words”, “ I love to dance, when I’m alone”,  “I like coffee, with my morning rum”, “ I am tired, of feeling lonely”, “my cat is my only friend”, “ the library is my favorite place”. “ I’m a song writer”, “ I’m a very bad driver”….. whatever comes to mind when you think of describing yourself as long as, you don’t reveal your identity, in any way shape or form , the unspoken rule will be before you reveal any of this details first send out 6 emails to the same person and if at that point you feel ready to share those details  you can ask your correspondent , would you like to know my name? I know this will probably be a challenge to most people, but remember , the purpose of this experiment is not to meet a lover , the purpose will be, the enjoyment of conversations with no expectations or strings attached. 

The body should contain 9 of your favorite things, from any of this categories,
(Example)
Favorite songs:
Favorite foods:
Favorite hobbies:cycling , poetry writing, music production.
Favorite books: Don Quijote de La Mancha, The son, diary of an oxygen thief.
Favorite movies: cloud atlas , the French dispatch , pulp fiction .
Favorite sports:
Favorite places:
Favorite animals:
Favorite plants:
Favorite tv shows:
 
This could be 1 from each category or like me 3 from 3  or 6 and 3. How ever you want to mix them,  just choose 9 of your favorite things, if you have more than 9 add them, just have 9 as a minimum.
Categories may be added as per suggestions.

And last but not least a brief letter about  yourself, WITHOUT revealing any personal details . (Excuse the redundancy).

I will serve as a middle man,  I will forward  your email to  any correspondent who may or may not be someone you may be able to enjoy a conversation with. 

The only requirements are 18+ ONLY, NO CREEPS! I will do moderation personally until  it becomes unmanageable. Eventually if  this little project takes off I’ll start working on a website + app. For now this is simply an idea, something to keep me busy on my free time, if it doesn’t that’s okay too, just thought I’d write it  into existence in the form of this post. 

		“Finally I can see it
These birds not meant to fly alone”

With love, mail-bird.

* *But godliness with contentment is great gain. — 1 Timothy 6:6* 

Contentment doesn’t mean settling for less or enjoying hardship. With our great human capacities, we’ll never be fully satisfied. But contentment means accepting our circumstances without complaining, making the best of them.

Paul wrote about his own journey toward this grace: “I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.” He had learned to find peace and joy that didn’t depend on external conditions. Even in the most difficult situations, he didn’t fret. It’s worth noting that Paul said he had “learned” contentment, implying it didn’t come naturally but required growth. He also told Timothy that godliness with contentment is great gain. Discontent is like poverty, even if one has much, while contentment is a form of true wealth.",1,1762358527.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False
1op6roo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1op6roo/the_energy_reset_that_finally_worked_for_me/,The Energy Reset That Finally Worked for Me,"Last year, I realized I was completely physically drained. Every day felt like I was running on fumes. Whether it was crashing in the afternoon, needing coffee just to function, or feeling exhausted despite sleeping 8 hours, my energy was consistently terrible.

It wasn't just about feeling tired... I was irritable during normal activities. Simple tasks felt overwhelming, exercise seemed impossible, even getting through a conversation required effort.

So I decided to do something different: an energy reset. I knew I had to retrain my body to produce natural energy instead of relying on stimulants and quick fixes. It wasn't perfect, but it worked better than anything else I've tried.

Here's what helped:

1. **A 30-Day Sleep Priority**: I started by establishing a consistent sleep schedule over the first two weeks. I didn't change everything overnight, but I set strict bedtimes and wake times even on weekends.
2. **Redirect Energy Crashes**: Every time I felt the afternoon slump, I went for a 10-minute walk or did light stretching instead of reaching for coffee. It sounds small, but it made a huge difference in breaking the caffeine dependency.
3. **Strict Meal Timing**: I set up eating windows that were consistent—breakfast within an hour of waking, no eating after 8 PM. It's wild how much better you feel when your body knows when to expect fuel.
4. **Relearn Rest**: At first, resting without screens or stimulation was hard. But over time, I realized real recovery happens in stillness. Now, I actually look forward to those quiet recharge moments.

It's been a few months, and I feel more energized, stable, and alive than I have in years. I'm still not perfect some days, I skip my routine and crash hard. But overall, I've learned that having consistent energy is treating your body with respect.",1,1762358495.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,1.0,False

Also: 50% as an option.,"I normally don't buy coffee during the week but yesterday decided to treat myself. I ordered a seasonal latte at a local coffeehouse and it ended up being 6-something with tax (6$ before tax probably). When it came time to pay on the iPad looking thing the choices were 3$, 2$, and 1$ as big squares up top and a little text that said either No Tip or Skip. However the 2$ square was pre-selected. 

The audacity to have a choice for 50%. For a latte. My total would have been 9$ for a small latte.

The audacity to have the default 33%. For a latte. 

I chose not to tip. Ironically, if it was closer to 15-20% (like 15, 18, 20) listed I wouldn't have noticed or been taken back and probably would have just tipped. I was so turned off by the audacity it became more about that. I totally see now how tipping culture has gotten out of control. I don't think most bars suggest tipping as much as 33%, let alone 50%. 

And then to top it off, they messed up the order and didn't include the ingredient that was literally the name of the latte, pretty much the main ingredient which made the latte unique. (It was a specific cereal latte and they forgot to top it with the cereal. They include it in the written description and picture.)",5,1762358418.0,EndTipping,2,1.0,False

I got a 4yo boy who’s smart, loud, allergic to naps, and somehow always sticky. He’s my whole world but man… I’m running on caffeine and vibes at this point.

Working from home sounds cute till you’re doing Zoom calls while a tiny human’s yelling “Mom look at this worm” right behind you. My days are just a blur of emails, dishes, snacks, laundry, deadlines, and cleaning up the same mess 4 times in a row.

Mornings start with the breakfast fight, then work calls, then trying to look alive on camera while folding clothes off-screen. By the time I get to dinner, I’m already done. Bath time feels like running a small wrestling event. Bedtime takes forever. And when it’s finally quiet, I still open my laptop like an idiot.

Sometimes I just cry a bit while stirring pasta. Not sad, just tired in my soul. Then he’ll say something like “You’re my favorite worker” and suddenly I’m laughing again.

My husband helps when he can but he’s working crazy hours too, so we’re both just surviving off takeout, coffee, and pure stubbornness. Some nights we eat cereal for dinner. Some days the house looks like it got hit by a toy hurricane. But somehow, we keep it going.

I used to think good moms were the calm, Pinterest-board type. Nah. Being a good mom is just showing up ... messy bun, tired eyes, cold coffee in hand.

So yeah, I’m exhausted. But I’m proud too. My kid’s loved, safe, and fed. I might not have it all together, but I’m still doing it.

*Living Blood* follows Drew Nelson, a weary editor who values quiet routines, good coffee, and the steady company of her cat. Her life runs on predictability—until her new trainee, Michael, reveals a secret that should be impossible. He’s a vampire, trying to live quietly in a world that no longer believes in monsters.

Drawn in by reluctant curiosity, Drew helps him navigate the strange limits of his condition, uncovering signs that vampirism is more science than myth. Their uneasy partnership deepens as they stumble into a hidden world of immortals, old experiments, and a rising threat determined to twist their existence into something divine.

As the boundary between safety and secrecy erodes, Drew finds herself forced to confront the cost of knowing too much—and the danger of caring for what should not exist.

Both unsettling and intimate, *Living Blood* blends dark humor, slow-burn suspense, and emotional realism into an urban-fantasy story about control, consequence, and what it truly means to be alive.",2,1762357951.0,u_R-L-Butler,1,1.0,False

​I have two very special bottles I'm opening soon: a 1980 Penfolds Grange and a 1989 Penfolds Grange. I’ve never had wine this old, and I want to make sure I prepare them correctly to honor these iconic vintages. I have emailed penfolds to see if they have any tips and no reply yet. So, i turm to you experts!
​The main concern is sediment and aeration.
​Decanting Time: I've stood the bottles upright for a week. Once decanted to remove sediment, how long should I let these specific vintages breathe? I've heard too long can cause old wine to fade quickly.
​1980 Grange: Should this be tasted immediately after decanting?
​1989 Grange: can it handle a little more air?
​Filtering Sediment: If the cork breaks or I get some sediment in the decanter, what is the best low-aeration filter? I've been advised against using a coffee filter. What would you recommend instead? A fine-mesh funnel?
​Any specific tips on the cork-pulling process for corks 35-44 years old would also be greatly appreciated!
​Thanks in advance for helping me make this a great experience!""",0,1762357858.0,wine,1,0.5,False

I started thinking like If someone is going to give me a cup of coffee to drink I am not going to drink it, instead I pour it (Im not gonna do it actually). That was my thought actually I still remember 😭.
I gave room for intellect to think so broad. Watching a movie so someone from behind harm me with knife or something, walking on road so something from the sky might fall.
Perception changed from then, new pattern is developed.
Intuition, instinct locked.
I dont know I am challenging with something, I faced lots of humiliation, too much anxiety, cant make friends, lost reality, emotionally flat, lost in thoughts, no planning, cant feel my body, couldn’t understand what others feel.
It used to feel like society is so elated but not me.
Couldn’t make good in academics, still heart knows that I am worth than what everyone have seen.
But Im completely HELPLESS.
I smoked pot, the intellect 10x got 10^2.
Thats when even my cognitive load couldn’t help. Been into Racing thoughts. I used to think in sleep(thats a rare and horrible experience). Those days I could still remember,no one should ever face that kind of shit.
2 years ago I was casually playing an interesting game suggested by my friend, I am feeling so happy at the moment, after 1hr I was so deeply and immersively involved in that game and I felt like a newly born one. I got a hope that I have life.
I was knowing that I am this intelligent and slowly started crying at some moment.
Even driving a world’s most expensive car wouldn’t buy me that happiness.
The happiness disappeared after a week, due to my past brain patterns I slipped into it again.
I am really smart and I couldn’t able to tolerate looking dumb to relatives and friends, that made me so sad, I slowly realised and accepted.
My chess fide is 1900 >
Actually Im here to get some assurance or get some guidance to get over from it.
I still suffer from this, it is not diagnosed till now, how to balance my intuition and intellect with room full of awareness.
Thank you for reading 🙏

We were gone for 10 days. I had a walmart delivery with my protein shakes for my coffee, turkey pepperoni, chomps meat sticks, and flavored waters. I ate mostly bun-less grilled chicken sandwiches and cheeseburgers, but I did cheat and snack! I haven't been on vacation in 7 years so I splurged on some disney treats\~shared with my kids only a bite or two but enough to satisfy a craving. I also did have some alcohol which I feel was a mistake because for me it goes hand in hand with over eating, so I will not be drinking again, lesson learned. I felt like this vacation was the first time we went somewhere and it didn't revolve around food& alcohol (which restaurants, planning for junk, etc.) I enjoyed the EXPERIENCE\~ walking 10+ miles a day, not sweating as much as I used to, FITTING ON EVERY RIDE even going on kiddie rollercoasters, going down water slides at the hotel not worried about weight limits, and less anxiety when flying (about the tight seat/belt). I weighed the exact same when I came home so I did not lose, but I certainly indulged within reason so I was happy still. I'm so thankful I decided to have this surgery I would not have been able to stick with these lifestyle changes on my own and being forced to do the mental work.

If you’re dreaming of ditching the usual tourist trails and diving into truly memorable road-trip experiences, here’s an updated and expanded narrative of epic, lesser-known journeys around the world. With an [international driving permit](https://www.e-itca.org/) (IDP) in hand and the freedom of a rental car, you can escape the crowds, embrace spontaneity, and uncover hidden gems that many travellers never reach.

Why choose the open road?

Road trips aren’t just about reaching your destination—they’re about **the journey**: the winding coastal road, the unexpected detour, the viewpoint you stumble upon, the little village where you stop for coffee. When you’re behind the wheel, with your own schedule and the map ahead of you, you get to dive deep into landscapes and cultures that public transport rarely reaches.  
Having an IDP is crucial: many [countries require](https://www.e-itca.org/international-driving-permit-countries) it for car rentals, it bridges language barriers by translating your home-license into multiple languages, and it ensures you’re covered legally, letting you relax and focus on the adventure.

# 1. Scotland’s Highlands — A Hidden Classic

  
Think of dramatic skies, jagged peaks, quiet single-track roads, and a sense of isolation that’s rare in today’s world. On the Isle of Skye (Scotland), routes like the drive to the Quiraing provide exactly that.

* A car is essential here since public transport is very limited and the roads can be narrow and steep.
* You’ll pass scenic vistas such as the Old Man of Storr and the famed Fairy Pools; the freedom to stop wherever you want makes all the difference.
* Plan for varied weather: mist, sun, rain—every mood adds to the experience.



# 2. Greece’s Peloponnese Peninsula — Less-Traveled Mediterranean

  
While Athens, Santorini and Mykonos draw huge crowds, the Peloponnese Peninsula in Greece remains comparatively peaceful and full of surprises: ancient ruins, charming villages, nearly untouched beaches.

* With a rental car you can effortlessly roam from coastal drives to mountain climbs.
* Be sure to check out sites like Ancient Messene — less visited and still atmospheric.
* Don’t miss the horseshoe-shaped Voidokilia Beach, which feels like a secret tucked away along the sea.



# 3. Colombia’s Coffee Region — Authentic, Green, Unhurried

  
Swap big-city tourism for the lush hills of Colombia. In the town of Salento and surrounding valleys, you’ll find verdant landscapes, towering wax-palm trees, and genuine local culture.

* Driving from Salento gives you access to the Valle de Cocora and nearby coffee farms with ease—public transport is limited.
* Take your time: stop for coffee, chat with local farmers, and soak up the slower pace.



# 4. Portugal’s Algarve — Sea-Cliffs, Hidden Beaches & Coastal Drives

  
The Algarve in southern Portugal is known to many, but many of its best spots remain off the main tourist routes. With your own wheels you can explore sea caves, remote beaches, and a mountain village or two.

* Drive to places like the Benagil Cave and take boat or kayak if you like, but getting there often requires a car.
* Visit the town of Monchique up in the hills to escape the beach crowds and enjoy cooler air and alpine-style views.



# 5. France’s Route des Grandes Alpes — High Altitude, Big Views

  
For those who love mountain drives, the Route des Grandes Alpes in France is pure joy: high passes, alpine lakes, and spectacular vistas from Geneva to the Mediterranean.

* Over 700 km and more than a dozen mountain passes — the freedom of a car lets you stop at any overlook.
* Highlights: the highest paved pass in Europe, Col de l’Iseran, and the turquoise waters of Lake Annecy.
* Be aware: mountain driving demands attention — weather can change fast, and some roads may be narrow or winding.



# 6. Western Australia — Vast Land, Sparse Crowds

Most travellers head to Australia’s east coast, but the western half holds immense, rugged beauty and far fewer tourists. In Western Australia you’ll find desert landscapes, pristine reefs, and vineyards — all requiring a vehicle to properly explore.

* Consider stops like the Ningaloo Reef for swimming with whale sharks, or the eerie Pinnacles Desert for moon-like rock formations.
* Be prepared: distances can be long, services sparse — fuel, food, and lodging may be far apart.
* A 4×4 may be beneficial depending on how off-road you’d like to go.



# 7. Spain’s Andalusia – White Villages & Moorish Heritage



In southern Spain, the region of Andalusia offers charming whitewashed villages perched on hillsides, rich history and dramatic views. A rental car is ideal to bounce from one village to the next.

* Visit Ronda for its cliff-side bridge, or the extraordinary village of Setenil de las Bodegas where houses are built into the rock overhangs.
* Drive at your own pace, stop for local tapas, enjoy the relaxed vibe away from the beach resorts.



# 8. South Africa’s Garden Route — Coast, Forest & Adventure

  
  
  
  
  


Garden Route in South Africa is an unforgettable stretch of coast, forest and lagoon-scapes — best experienced with your own vehicle.

* Stop at places like Tsitsikamma National Park for hiking and canopy tours, the tranquil Knysna Lagoon for kayaking, or the Cango Caves for underground exploration.
* Driving lets you pace the adventure and stop where you like, when you like.



# 9. A Few New Picks to Consider

Here are some newer or less-publicised routes, especially suited if you want to go truly “off the map”:

* In India: remote coastal or high-terrain drives through lesser-visited pilot routes. For example, drives in the Western Ghats, smaller villages in Rajasthan, or river-island routes in the northeast. ([India Trip Driver](https://www.indiatripdriver.com/blog/india-off-the-beaten-path?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* In the USA: lesser-known scenic byways such as the Hells Canyon Scenic Byway (Oregon) or the Cherohala Skyway (Tennessee/North Carolina). ([Roadtrippers](https://roadtrippers.com/magazine/secret-usa-road-trips/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))



# 10. Planning Tips for the Road

* **Vehicle choice**: Depending on terrain, you might need something more rugged. For narrow mountain roads, choose a compact but sure-footed car.
* **Local driving regulations**: With an IDP you’ll be legally good, but also check local rules (which side of road, tolls, fuel types).
* **Timing & seasonality**: Some roads are only open certain months (especially mountain passes). Check ahead.
* **Accommodation & stops**: In remote areas, book ahead or ensure there are safe places to pull over if you’re camping.
* **Flexibility**: The best memories often come from the unexpected: a side road you didn’t plan, a village you stay in an extra day — build in buffer time.



# Conclusion

There’s a whole world of road-trips beyond the blockbuster destinations — from Scotland’s remote highlands to Portugal’s hidden coastal corners, from South Africa’s lush routes to Colombia’s coffee hills. With the freedom of a car, an IDP, and an open mindset, you can discover more intimate, authentic, and memorable travel experiences. So go ahead: chart your own course, embrace the detours, and let the journey become the destination.

If you like, I can pull together a **full list** of 12-15 off-the-beaten-path road-trip routes (with maps, ideal seasons and recommended stops) tailored for travellers based in India or looking to start from Asia. Would that interest you?

• 20g coffee

• 260ml of water

• bloom for 30 seconds with 60ml of water, gently swirl twice, at 30 second mark pour the remaining 200ml of water

• at 2 minute mark place cap on, carefully flip, gently press till you hear hissing and stop.

Overall the cup of coffee it produced was sweet and enjoyable. It felt light, but had a full bodied flavor. I did do a 20ml bypass after the first two sips to mellow out the sweetness as it was to much for me.

This is why **sensory marketing** has become a powerful strategy for retailers. By engaging the five human senses, businesses can influence emotions, create memorable experiences, and increase sales. Let’s explore the five ways sensory marketing transforms retail success.

# 1. Visual Appeal: Designing to Attract

From store layout to product packaging, sight is the most dominant sense in retail. Strategic use of lighting, colours, and digital displays can make products more desirable. For instance, bright lighting in supermarkets encourages quick buying, while soft, warm lighting in luxury stores creates a sense of exclusivity.

**Impact:** Enhances brand perception, drives impulse purchases, and increases dwell time.

# 2. Soundscapes: Setting the Shopping Rhythm

The right music sets the pace of shopping. Slow, relaxing tunes in cafés encourage longer stays, while upbeat tracks in fast-fashion stores drive faster decisions. Even subtle background sounds like a coffee machine or gentle chatter can create the right atmosphere.

**Impact:** Shapes customer mood, influences buying speed, and strengthens brand identity.

# 3. Signature Scents: Triggering Emotions and Memories

Smell has a strong link to memory and emotions. Retailers use signature scents to differentiate their stores for example, bakeries using the aroma of fresh bread or clothing stores diffusing a subtle fragrance. Customers often associate these scents with comfort, trust, and brand loyalty.

**Impact:** Encourages repeat visits, builds emotional connection, and increases basket size.

# 4. Touch & Feel: Building Trust Through Interaction

Allowing customers to touch, feel, or test products increases confidence in buying decisions. Furniture stores, tech retailers, and cosmetic brands all use tactile experiences to build trust. Even textures in packaging can make a product feel premium.

**Impact:** Reduces hesitation, increases conversions, and boosts product value perception.

# 5. Taste: Creating Instant Desire

For food and beverage retailers, taste is one of the most persuasive tools. Free samples at supermarkets or new drink tasters at cafés spark curiosity and often lead to instant sales. It’s not just about selling the sample it’s about creating cravings that lead to larger purchases.

**Impact:** Converts trial into purchase, drives product discovery, and enhances customer satisfaction.

# Final Thoughts

By activating sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste, retailers can transform ordinary shopping into unforgettable experiences. Sensory marketing is not just about selling products – it’s about creating emotional connections that inspire loyalty and repeat sales.

I'm turning 34 tomorrow! So there's a chance I wake up tomorrow morning with cracking knees and a squeaky lower back.

I'd describe myself as a calm, curious, and creative person. I live a mostly cozy, peaceful life with the occasional moment of chaos (my two cats almost always have something to do with it...). I love working with my hands, crafting, and building things like Lego and plastic model kits, but I also design things to 3D print sometimes. I read non-fiction and fantasy/romantasy, I love cooking but my baking is a health hazard, and I'm always down for some ARAM. My guilty pleasures are iced coffee with a lot of whipped cream and watching terrible Netflix dating shows (looking at you, Love is Blind).

Other than that, I like to travel (going on a city trip around Sweden in December), am a foodie, and go to concerts a few times a year. I typically listen to rock, metalcore, and drum&bass. Though ""*as long as my brain likes it""* is probably more accurate, cause there's some weird stuff in my Spotify likes. I'm going to Halestorm in 2 weeks and then Poppy in March next year. Still hoping/praying for a Spiritbox Europe 2026 tour.

Having said that, my biggest passion is powerlifting. I'm fascinated by human anatomy and biomechanics and the fact we're able to lift pretty heavy ass weights with the right (and safe!) training. I try to be 1% better everytime I train.

Two things I hope to cross off my bucketlist soon are walking a dog and trying DnD.

I'm politically left leaning, agnostic, childfree, neurodivergent (ADHD, the *goes on side quests a lot* kind), and a feminist.

I'm looking to chat with someone around my age and in Europe. Anyways, if this spoke to you feel free to reach out :)

Now we are at the stage where we’ve enjoyed espresso hobby and drinks to the point we’re ready to upgrade the machine itself. 

I tend to drink americanos and she likes a latte or cappuccino.

I was originally set on getting the profitec go, but we don’t want to upgrade again in 2 years so are looking for the sort of end game machine for our household. Also the workflow is important for me, I want to feel like I’m optimizing my time at the machine. 

Our budget is around 2,000 USD, but can move up if convicted in a better option. 

The machines I’ve considered so far:

This machine looks spectacular, has nice features, but is obviously a heat exchanger so debating if it’s worth jumping to the dual boiler 

2. Breville dual boiler

3. Lelit Elizabeth 

Nice to have a small dual boiler, but my wife doesn’t love the look of it, however could be convinced.

We both worked on Team A, but in different offices. I’ll call her, Shelly. Shelly is originally from NJ and earlier this year, she told me she’s coming for two weeks to visit fam and will be working from the NYC office. We got close. She told me she really missed the north and we talked about how great it would be if she could transfer to NYC. 

Management decided there wasn’t a big need for all of us on Team A in NYC so they moved 15 out of 30 of us to Teams B & C. Shelly put in a request for NYC and tried to really get close to the Executive Director (ED) for Team A in NYC. She would never mention to the ED we hung out after work when she was visiting family. ED said there’s space in their Westchester office (outside NYC) and Shelly got approved. She invited me to her apartment in Florida and introduced me to everyone in the office. It was also her last week there. 

She’s now settled in NYC and commutes to the Westchester NY office. I noticed that she’s been using my name a lot. Her new manager is someone I’ve worked closely with. They’ve now built a great relationship. Shelly told me she told her new manager about how we’re close and how I went to visit her in Tampa. When she now sits with Team A in NYC she told everyone about how much she enjoys hanging out with me. My previous manager (Team A) even told me she mentioned it to him when I bumped into him grabbing coffee. He asked me how it was and told me what she said. I was surprised because he never made an effort to talk to her whenever she visited before. Shelly even told me she felt like he didn’t like her and I didn’t get why she cared because he wasn’t her manager.


It seems Shelly is visiting the NYC office more and more. Which is what her ED said she could do, hence why she got the apartment in NYC. Shelly was here last week and didn’t tell me until the end of the day when I walked by that area. I said hi to former team mates there and Shelly asked if we knew each other… Shelly then talks about how I’m a good friend and I even went down to visit her. Shelly then talked about this after work gathering by set up by Laura. I know Laura and grab lunch with her once a week because she’s close to someone on my new team. Shelly goes, Laura is my friend! She invited me… Laura invited everyone though.

We didn't want to travel consecutively, so Mexico, Europe, and California were split with a few days back home so that we could rest and get ready for the next segment. This was very nice, but obviously did use some extra points & cash that could have been saved.

**August - September** 

**TPA-Cancun x2** tickets Jetblue (12,000 pts + $258 Roundtrip)

  
**Marriott Cancun all-inclusive**

4x free night certificates + 11k Marriott points

\- Really nice property & second time we've been here. Service is great and the food & drinks are fantastic for an all-inclusive. Definitely a more relaxed vibe for Cancun, but exactly what we were looking for. Mainly stayed on the resort as this was a more relaxing way to kick off our vacation.

**September** 

**Virgin Atlantic Economy** 11,000 +$142 (1.4x transfer bonus ->15k)

* TPA - LHR 
* Took advantage of a transfer bonus to get over to Europe. Very comfy seats, and I was able to get some sleep on the flight over. 

**British airways** 7000 +$62 (1.5x transfer bonus) 

* LHR-PRG
* Took advantage of another transfer bonus, total cost from TPA-PRG 18,000 points & $204 dollars for 2 people.

**Linder Hotel Prague Castle** 18,000 (3x nights )

* Booked when it was still a category 1. Honestly, a beautiful property essentially in the same complex as the Strahov Monastery. It's a 2-minute walk to the Strahov Brewery, which offers amazing food and drinks, and had one of the best views of the entire trip just a short walk from the brewery. 
* Prague was easily one of the trip's highlights and a place we'd love to visit again.

**Linder Hotel Vienna am Belvedere** 15,000 (3x nights)

* Great location with an upgrade to the Belverde Palace view (via Hyatt Explorist).
* It was great to be able to start each day with a walk through the palace gardens & it had a convenient tram stop right next to the hotel. 

**Hyatt Centric Murano Venice** 3x 1-4 category free nights 

* Upgraded to the Loft Suite, which was extremely nice and had a great view of the canal. 
* Had a traghetto stop literally right in front of the hotel, which was a lifesaver. From the room to the stop was less than 3 minutes, and made trips back and forth from Venice extremely convenient. 
* The hotel water taxi from the airport was a great experience and had us there within 20 minutes.

**Ramada Plaza Milano Centrale** $247 + 9k Wyndham points 

* Bought Wyndham points for this hotel as prices were through the roof in the area for Milan fashion week.
* Upgraded to a suite with 2 balconies and a very nice walk-in closet that made the stay very nice. The breakfast spread was fantastic and they offered complimentary mimosas as well, which was cool to see.
* Easy 10 minute ride to the Duomo & the main areas of Milan.

**Bellagio Apartment 4x nights** $596

* Paid in cash since there weren't many options for points, but definitely the highlight of the trip.
* Lake Como was a bucket list trip and it was awesome to finally see it.

* Great hotel right in the heart of Madrid, less than a 10-minute walk to get to most of the main sites, including the royal palace.

**NH Madrid Airport** 1x Night $30

* Used the extra $50 credit given for Chase Sapphire cardholders (not the one that comes with the card)
* Nice stay with a free shuttle to the airport

**MAD-JFK Iberia Business** 64,000 + $315 

* The lounge was great and spacious & the lie flat seats were huge

**Hyatt Place Long Island City** 2x Cat 1-4 free night certificates

* Upgraded to Suite
* Decent hotel with easy access to Manhattan via subway. Free breakfast was a big plus, too, and it was fairly good. Great area with a lot of restaurants close by.

**California**

**American Airlines:** TPA-SFO $122 for 2 tickets 

**Club Wyndham Vino Bello Resort Napa** 40,500 (3x nights) 

* Part of a larger complex of hotel resorts with access to their amenties as well. Great location with a free shuttle to downtown Napa.
* Gym was HUGE, and they also had their own vineyard you could walk through, as well as a bowling alley, grocery store, coffee shop, and a myriad of restaurants in the complex. Made the stay super convenient.

**Wild Palms Hotel**, Sunnyvale CA 3,500 1x night

**The Monterey Hotel**: Cash $170 for 2 nights

**Alila Ventana Big Sur**, Big Sur CA 180,000 4x nights (added on an extra night)

* Originally, a 3-night stay but ended up adding a 4th night on night 3 as availability opened up the day before and we were having an amazing time
* Upgraded to the coastal house suite for 3 nights, and then the cottage for the added-on night. Coastal House Suite was 1300 sq ft had 2 balconies, one with a jacuzzi attached to the bedroom, and the other being very large and spacious with a hammock. The cottage was very secluded and had a large 600 ft balcony w/ views overlooking the mountains, jacuzzi, and hammock.
* Highlight of the trip, seriously, one of the best hotel stays we've ever had. Its worth the hype in every way and has easily the best views you'll see at a resort.
* They've changed the menus at the Sur House to simplify things, and while I personally would've preferred having more options, the food was excellent, and the views on the porch are a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience. 

**Wild Palms Hotel** 6,500 1x night

# Now some big updates today from different corners of the recruiting world:

# 💼 Weil Gotshal 2L Summer Associate Apps About To Open (Or Possibly Already Opened)

Current associates have reported that Weil is about to open/may have already opened 2L Summer 2027 apps (but even they are unclear on it).

Key notes they heard from recruiting attorneys:

* They prefer direct applications (through their site) rather than school portals.
* Apply early — it’s fine if grades aren’t out yet.
* Offers are expected between January and March.
* Associates are encouraged to flag promising students they meet, which appears to be Weil’s strategy to manage the early recruiting window and identify candidates faster.

# ☕ Gunderson Dettmer Coffee Chat → Potential Interview Conversions

Gunderson is pairing 1Ls for attorney coffee chats, open through November 14. Exact language, as shared by a student was:

“If you’re a 1L interested in speaking with a Gunderson Dettmer attorney to learn more about emerging companies and venture capital or working with startups, please complete this form to express your interest. We’ll do our best to connect you with an attorney that matches your interests.”

Several students reported that partners — even semi-retired ones — are personally conducting chats and in some cases hinting at or offering early interviews outside of the formal application process.

The chats seem to be doubling as soft screeners for strong candidates.

https://preview.redd.it/bhceiaknqvyf1.png?width=2934&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea110330589b41afeb187558eda7ec3d2ce0048



# 🧾 Kirkland & Ellis H-1B / Visa Disclaimer

Students reported receiving a firmwide disclaimer in K&E’s 1L Summer Associate email stating:

“This position is not available to any candidates who will now or in the future require a U.S. visa from the Firm, such as the H-1B, TN-1, TN-2, or E-3 visa.”

This seems atypically explicit — it’s not standard to see a restriction that broad in a recruiting announcement. It’s caused understandable frustration among international students given K&E’s size and market position.

We’re collecting screenshots and confirmations across schools; if you received the same message, feel free to DM or comment so we can verify whether it’s uniform across offices.

the way the sea waits for the moon 
quietly, faithfully, knowing it will rise for everyone else
but never for me.
The phone glows on my nightstand like a small, dying star,
and I watch it flicker,
hoping the universe might make a mistake
and send me your name again.

The world outside my window sleeps,
but I sit in the dark with my palms open,
like someone waiting for rain that never comes.
Every second stretches thin and heavy,
and my heartbeat sounds like footsteps
in a hallway no one walks down anymore.
Hope hums quietly in my chest,
a song too sad to stop playing.

Every vibration feels like mercy.
Every notification feels like forgiveness.
I reach for the screen too fast,
and my hands tremble with the kind of foolishness
only love could teach.
You would laugh if you saw me now,
how I still hold the phone like a fragile promise,
as if it could break the silence
or bring you home.

It’s strange 
how my days still begin and end with you.
Morning coffee still tastes like the one you never finished.
I still pour too much sugar,
the way you used to when you were trying to make everything sweeter.
By night, I lie in bed,
staring at the ceiling until it blurs into memory.
I whisper your name into the quiet,
not to call you back,
but to remember how it felt to say it without hurting.
You never come,
but I still wait,
the way the sky waits for dawn
even when it knows the sun has stopped rising.

Sometimes I scroll through our old messages
just to hear the echo of who we were.
Your words still glow on the screen
like little ghosts refusing to fade.
I trace them with my finger,
pretending it’s your hand instead of pixels and light.
I can almost hear your voice 
that small laugh you tried to hide
when I said something unfunny just to make you smile.
I can almost feel the warmth
of the love I didn’t know how to keep.

It’s been so long since you left,
and still, I don’t recognise myself.
Grief has worn me down
the way rivers carve stone 
slowly, endlessly, beautifully cruel.
You knew me when I was still light,
before sorrow made a home in my skin.
Now, even my reflection looks like apology.
And I wonder 
if we passed each other on the street years from now,
would you know it was me?
Would your eyes soften the way they used to,
or would you walk past
like someone escaping a ghost?

Some nights, I still talk to you,
softly, as if the dark can carry my words farther than the light.
I tell you about the weather,
about how I’m learning to live in the quiet.
Sometimes, I tell you I’m sorry 
for the words I said,
and for the ones I never did.
The silence answers with the gentleness of your memory,
and I let it break me a little more each time.

Some nights I still wait for your text.
And I know it sounds foolish,
but I think we all do 
we all wait for someone who’s gone,
for a sound, a sign, a mercy.
Maybe that’s what love really is 
not the presence, but the waiting.
And so I wait,
because even if your name never lights my screen again,
you still light something in me.
And that is both my punishment
and my proof that you were real.

1op66zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TRX_Traveller/comments/1op66zs/i_built_muscle_using_a_trx_for_10yrs_and_learned/,I Built Muscle Using a TRX for 10yrs and Learned THIS,"I’ve spent 10 years figuring out how to build lean muscle using just a TRX suspension trainer and made every mistake possible.

But once I cracked the code, I built more lean muscle in 3 years with suspension training, than a decade at the gym.

https://preview.redd.it/u7oc4xgyjgzf1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4def072d10f3f490dff60b6169aaeb92dda6c5d1

And then helped over 8,000 people do the same.

So in this post, I’m going to tell you the 20 lessons that turned suspension training from frustrating guesswork…

Into a lean muscle-building system you can actually use to transform your body anywhere.

\--------

# Lesson 1: Muscle-centric

I hammered TRX chest presses for months at first, but saw zero chest gains. Then a mentor asked, ‘Are you FEELING your chest work, or are you just moving through space?’ He had me slow down and squeeze ONLY my chest through every inch of movement. Within 4 weeks, I finally saw real chest definition.

**So lesson number one is Master muscle-centric technique, because…**

Most people use movement-centric technique where multiple muscles share the load—meaning no single muscle gets enough stimulus for growth. But when you isolate ONE target muscle by slowing down, squeezing hard, and not letting anything else help, that muscle does ALL the work. That’s what creates real growth.

\--------

# Lesson 2: Mind-Muscle

All I used to think about during workouts was work emails or life admin, but when I started closing my eyes and visualising each muscle stretching and contracting, not only did my muscle activation increase, which improved my muscle building results, but my workouts also turned into a form of moving meditation for better mental well-being.

**So lesson number two is use your mind-muscle connection, because…**

It’s been proven to triple your muscle activation for strength gains and turn workouts into meditation so you finish calm and grounded. As Andreas a father of two messaged me:

https://preview.redd.it/qzxmfpc0kgzf1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83190061751236f6b96420a582afb317549a2ff7

\--------

# Lesson 3: Time Under Tension

When I first started suspension training, I thought “well, there’s no weight so I have to do more reps to make up for it” I did fast reps and just focused on hitting high rep numbers, and all i got was a sweat and sore joints, but when I slowed every rep right down focusing on quality movement, I finally built the lean muscle I’d been chasing.

**So lesson number three is slow down, because…**

Time under tension builds muscle, not rep count. 20 fast curls with poor form creates less growth stimulus than 8 perfectly executed curls with maximum tension. Aim for a minimum of 6 seconds per rep.

\--------

# Lesson 4: Posture

I had terrible muscle imbalances and rounded shoulders from years of heavy ego lifting in a gym. When I switched, I couldn’t perform bodyweight exercises effectively with full ranges of motion, but when I spent 4 weeks fixing my posture before focusing on muscle building, suddenly every exercise clicked, and my performance increased.

**So lesson number four is fix your posture first, because…**

All human movement stacks on top of the starting position of your spine, pelvis, and scapula on your upper back. These seem unrelated to muscle building, but if your posture is bad, you can’t move properly. Fix your posture and you unlock your muscle-building potential.

\--------

# Lesson 5: Momentum

My TRX bicep curls used to involve my whole body swinging using momentum because it meant I could hit a high rep number, and my arms never changed after months of effort, but when I focused on only squeezing my biceps to cause the movement, they finally started growing.

**So lesson number five is lock your body in stone, because…**

If you eliminate all swinging and momentum, your target muscle has to start and maintain the movement, which means it does the maximum work and receives the maximum muscle growth stimulus.

\--------

# Lesson 6: Range of Motion

When I first started using a TRX, I still carried my gym ego. I’d create the hardest angle possible to feel strong, but it meant I only did partial ranges of motion with poor form because it was too hard, but I dropped my ego and reduced the angle to focus on full ranges of motion, my muscle gain dramatically increased.

**So lesson number six is use a full range of motion for every exercise, because…**

Doing half reps leaves parts of your muscles undeveloped, which causes imbalances, injuries, and limits progress. Take every muscle from a fully stretched position to a fully contracted position for complete muscle development.

\--------

# Lesson 7 – Negative Phase

I used to think results came from the positive phase of an exercise, like when you pull yourself up on a TRX row, so I’d just drop down with gravity on the lowering phases, not giving them much thought, but when I started lowering myself slowly with control and resisting gravity, I built strength a lot quicker.

**So lesson number seven is control your negative, because…**

If you’re not engaging the muscle by lowering yourself slowly, you’re leaving 33% of strength gains on the table. Go against gravit,y lower with contro,l and squeeze the muscle the whole way down

\--------

# Lesson 8: Uncomfortable

The burning sensation in my muscles used to make me quit immediately, thinking ‘that’s my limit, time to stop.’ But when I learned to breathe through the burn for just 10 more seconds… I broke through every plateau I’d been stuck at.

**So lesson number eight is get uncomfortable and know it isn’t a sign to stop, because…**

Your mind gives up long before your muscle actually fails. Think of it like the empty petrol warning light on a car, you still have 50 more miles when it flashes.

\--------

# Lesson 9: Breathing

I was breathing through my mouth during all workouts, but when I learned that nasal breathing is more effective for oxygen exchange and energy production, I forced myself to breathe only through my nose for as long as possible. I can’t point to dramatic results, but my internal focus improved, and the science convinced me to stick with it

**So lesson number nine is breathe through your nose as much as you can during workouts, because…**

Nasal breathing improves circulation, increases fat burning, and reduces stress hormones, which is an added bonus if you’re already stressed from back-to-back meetings

\--------

# Lesson 10: Instability

I used to think suspension training wasn’t for me because I’d shake like a leaf and feel embarrassed. But when I embraced the instability instead of fighting it, over time I built deep stabiliser muscles, the shaking went, and I actually felt functionally strong for real life, rather than ‘gym strong’

**So lesson number ten is embrace the instability when you start, because…**

Your body will automatically reduce muscular contractions when it senses instability, which is why you feel like you’re not getting much out of the suspension trainer. But stick with it and over time you’ll build deep stabilising strength which will increase your performance and in turn muscle gain. As roy messaged me after 4 weeks:

https://preview.redd.it/eybdm4l2kgzf1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3106e2f6a7d56a348bc570faeaa2cc9326cad009

\--------

# Lesson 11: Poor Mobility

I always had tight hamstrings and hips regardless of how much I stretched them, but when I finally started focusing on my technique by isolating individual muscles with proper form and built balanced leg muscles, my mobility and flexibility issues disappeared without a single stretch.

**So lesson number eleven is a lack of mobility signals muscle weakness not tightness, because…**

If you’re tight, it’s usually muscular imbalance. So focus on fully lengthening and contracting muscles with proper form, and those imbalances causing mobility issues will disappear without endless stretching

\--------

# Lesson 12: Rest

I was training 6 days a week with one rest day, proud of my hustle-culture dedication. But my strength plateaued, my sleep quality tanked, and I was always sore. When I finally added consistent rest days, I came back stronger every session, and my muscle growth accelerated.

**So lesson number twelve is don’t underestimate rest for growth, because…**

If your body never gets time to fully recover, you’ll always be training in a state of muscle breakdown, which adds additional stress to your body.

\--------

# Lesson 13: Recover Faster

I avoided all cardio thinking it would kill my muscle gains, but I was constantly flagging between sets and my overall recovery was slow, so I tried adding light jogging twice a week, and after a month my recovery between sets and after workouts became much quicker 

**So lesson number thirteen is increase your aerobic fitness for faster recovery, because…**

The better your cardiovascular fitness, the faster you recover, which means you can train hard even when work drains you. Add some light cardio with nasal breathing 2 times per week.

These next few aren’t even about training,  but they’ll double your results

\--------

# Lesson 14: Poser

I had chicken legs for years and no matter how hard i trained them I couldn’t get them to grow, but when I started practicing posing in front of the mirror I realsied i could barely squeeze or contract my leg muscles at all, so i practiced posing after every workout and overtime my mind-muscle connection became stronger, and my legs finally started to grow..

**So lesson number fourteen is to become a master poser, because…**

If you can’t squeeze your muscles correctly without weight, you won’t be able to do it with weight. Practising posing improved neurological pathways (mind-muscle!) so you can squeeze your muscles powerfully in workouts

\--------

# Lesson number 15: Fidgeter

Outside of workouts, I used to sit a lot, (this was before I had kids), sometimes 8 hours a day and I struggled to shift belly fat, but when I became obsessed about moving as much as possible each day, consistent fat loss and maintaining a lean body became normal life.

**So lesson number fifteen is become a master fidgeter, because…**

When you sit for prolonged periods, your body goes into fat-storing hibernation mode, your metabolism slows, and recovery drops. Your body loves constant movement and thrives when it does so look for every excuse to move

\--------

# Lesson 16: Gut

I used to wake up and grab a coffee first thing, and by mid-afternoon, I had terrible gas, low moods, and energy, but when I started my mornings with a pint of lemon water, Himalayan salt, and a probiotic instead, my gas vanished, my mood stabilised, and I stopped reaching for that 3pm coffee to survive afternoons..

**So lesson number sixteen is prioritise your gut health first thing on a morning, because…**

Your gut has 100 million neurons. These neurons are the same as are found within the brain. The gut is your second brain and affects how you feel, along with your energy levels.

\--------

# Lesson 17: Food Combinations

I thought my “healthy” meals of pasta with a splash of olive oil and avocado were helping me with the energy to train hard to get lean, but I always struggled to shift the stubborn fat, until I separated my fats and carbs into different meals, and finally started losing the stubborn fat a lot easier

**So lesson number seventeen is don’t combine high fat and high carbs, because…**

Carbs cause insulin to be released in the body; insulin is a fat-storing hormone. The body will look to store fat immediately when insulin is spiked. Eat either a high fat, low carb meals. Or a high-carb, low-fat meal. This is one of the first nutrition frameworks I teach everyone in the [fitness freedom athletes community](http://fitnessfreedomathletes.com/trx-programs) and it leads to these results…

https://preview.redd.it/f7q8e745kgzf1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a204a9fd9a191aef41a15b684c9ebb5260d2314

\--------

# Lesson 18: Timing

I was eating carbs randomly throughout the day, and my muscle growth was average, but when I shifted the majority of my carb intake to right after my workouts, I started building muscle more consistently than I ever had before.

**So lesson number eighteen is time your carbs around workouts, because…**

During and after a workout blood flow to your muscles increases by 80% and insulin sensitivity peaks too, so take advantage of that flow and feed your muscles what they need to repair and grow

\--------

# Lesson 19: Fat Free

I went on a low-fat diet thinking I’d lose weight faster, but my energy crashed, my sex drive disappeared, and I actually started gaining fat, so I added healthy fats back in and everything normalised within weeks.

**So lesson number nineteen is don’t follow fat-free diets, because…**

Healthy fats increase good cholesterol, which is essential for hormone production. Low-fat diets reduce hormone production, causing low testosterone and fluctuating estrogen

\--------

# Lesson 20: Energy

I used to chug coffee and energy drinks to fight daily fatigue, spending a fortune and feeling jittery, but when I learned about how critical potassium was for energy production and started eating more greens and added a greens supplement, my natural energy came back, and I dropped the caffeine dependency.

**So lesson number twenty is for more energy eat more potassium, because…**

If you’re waking up sluggish, caffeine is just a short-term fi,x and the root cause is likely due to low potassium.

Now here’s the thing…

knowing these TRX training lessons is one thing.

Actually applying them in a structured program is another.

I used to think that I dissociate repeatedly. I have no good mental clarity for 12 years.
The problem is I’m not intuitively well, I overused intellect in an abnormal way, that costed me hell of 12 years and still counting.
I am 22M. When I was 9,10.. something I couldn’t remember, I was traumatised due to, a principal hit me for not doing wrong aggressively. I am so overwhelmed with fear. I am so sad gone to, too much of depression for many days. I havent spoke about this to my parents and Im mute.
After 3 days past the incident, my intellect become too loud, and I was thinking about an Indian movie “krish”. The movies plot in short is hero’s father is a scientist who discovers a technology which predicts future visually. So I decided to not let my future known to others so Ill be unpredictable.
I started thinking like If someone is going to give me a cup of coffee to drink I am not going to drink it, instead I pour it (Im not gonna do it actually). That was my thought actually I still remember 😭.
I gave room for intellect to think so broad. Watching a movie so someone from behind harm me with knife or something, walking on road so something from the sky might fall.
Perception changed from then, new pattern is developed.
Intuition, instinct locked.
I dont know I am challenging with something, I faced lots of humiliation, too much anxiety, cant make friends, lost reality, emotionally flat, lost in thoughts, no planning, cant feel my body, couldn’t understand what others feel.
It used to feel like society is so elated but not me.
Couldn’t make good in academics, still heart knows that I am worth than what everyone have seen.
But Im completely HELPLESS.
I smoked pot, the intellect 10x got 10^2.
Thats when even my cognitive load couldn’t help. Been into Racing thoughts. I used to think in sleep(thats a rare and horrible experience). Those days I could still remember,no one should ever face that kind of shit.
2 years ago I was casually playing an interesting game suggested by my friend, I am feeling so happy at the moment, after 1hr I was so deeply and immersively involved in that game and I felt like a newly born one. I got a hope that I have life.
I was knowing that I am this intelligent and slowly started crying at some moment.
Even driving a world’s most expensive car wouldn’t buy me that happiness.
The happiness disappeared after a week, due to my past brain patterns I slipped into it again.
I am really smart and I couldn’t able to tolerate looking dumb to relatives and friends, that made me so sad, I slowly realised and accepted.
My chess fide is 1900 >
Actually Im here to get some assurance or get some guidance to get over from it.
I still suffer from this, it is not diagnosed till now, how to balance my intuition and intellect with room full of awareness.

So I finally pulled the trigger on a 2016 Audi A3 Premium Plus S-Line TDI. Got it for **₹10.75L**, with **50,000 km** on the odo. Overall the car is in excellent condition - only thing it needs is a left rear bulb replacement 😅

Service history checks out too — all services done at Audi itself, with the **last service done in June 2025**. The only thing I couldn't find in the records is **DSG service history**. This A3 comes with the **DQ250 wet clutch** DSG, and I’m not sure if/when the gearbox oil was ever changed.

So my questions are:

* Should I get the **DSG oil + filter changed proactively**?
* What’s the recommended interval for the DQ250?

Also wanted to say **thank you** to everyone here who helped me decide between the Passat and this one. The Passat I was considering had \~100k km on it, so I ended up going with the A3 instead. Planning to go **Stage 1 or Stage 2** soon and maybe a **custom exhaust** down the line

1op61sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1op61sp/the_school_i_work_at_doesnt_want_its_students_to/,The school I work at doesn’t want its students to learn.,"I started working at a small private school in a tiny town this year. So tiny, in fact, that when you look up the school online, it lists the neighboring town instead. At first, everything seemed perfect. The students were polite, the funding was generous, and parents donated more than you could possibly imagine. I kept telling myself I’d finally found a good job - steady, safe, normal.

I know I should be grateful for this opportunity, and I probably shouldn't even be writing this, but something just feels off.

The drive to work is the first sign something's wrong. There's this long, narrow road with thick trees on either side. Every morning I pass under these branches that twist together and almost form eye shapes. It sounds silly, but it feels like they're watching me. I know that doesn't make sense. They're just trees. But there's never anyone else around, and in that silence, those shapes start to feel deliberate.

When I finally arrive on campus after that unnerving drive, the school itself doesn't offer much relief. Even with all the money pouring into this place, the buildings feel run down. The hallways are chipped and scuffed, there are cobwebs in the corners, and the floors stick in odd spots. It’s like a school full of children from families who could buy anything, but somehow it’s slowly being forgotten.

The isolation doesn't stop at the tree line, either. There's no cell reception anywhere on campus, inside or out, so the only way to stay connected is through the school's network. It makes everything feel cut off, like we exist in our own little world that the rest of society can't reach.

What bothers me more than the buildings or the dead zones, though, are the students themselves. They're amazing athletes, near-prodigies in the arts, and could debate with a grown adult without even breaking a sweat. But they can't read a basic sentence, and when I talk about history, they either have no idea what I'm saying or get the facts completely wrong. The longer I stay here, the more it feels like the school is designed to keep them talented and obedient but mostly uneducated.

It sounds crazy, I know. A school deliberately keeping its students in the dark? Surely someone would have said something years ago.

That's when I started noticing the pattern. Most of the staff are alumni, and most of the students are children of alumni. I'm sure the adults know exactly what's going on. And yet somehow, here I am, a music teacher with no connections to the school, feeling like I stepped into something I shouldn't have.

Maybe it's the isolation getting to me, or maybe I'm finally seeing clearly, but there are things happening here that I can't explain. The students sometimes know things about me they shouldn't. They whisper in corners and stop when I walk by. Sometimes I swear I hear footsteps behind me in empty hallways, or see shadows moving just outside the classroom windows, but when I look, there's nothing there.

I keep thinking about how powerful these kids' families are, not just politically but across the state, controlling land and businesses and whatever else. It's like the school is their little playground, and no one else is allowed to understand how it really works.

Last week, I started noticing my classroom door open when I was sure I’d locked it. I keep telling myself I’m being paranoid. And today, one of my students left a drawing on my desk after class. It was a picture of me, sitting at my kitchen table. The details were too accurate. The crack in the wall behind me, the specific mug I use for coffee, even the way my curtains hang.

I live alone. My address isn't listed anywhere public.

And my kitchen window faces the woods.

1op619a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisvuitton/comments/1op619a/large_vs_small_bags_in_this_economy/,Large vs. Small Bags.... in this Economy?!?!?!??!?!,"# the setup, the inspo, the muse

I was ~~perched at a chic café in the UWS~~ stuck at my WFH desk with gr\*ss black coffee catching up with a friend who dropped the bombshell that is **the ‘hemline theory’**.

*Record scratch*. What is THAT? She explained:

>**Theory:** Skirts are shorter in good economic times and longer in poor economic times.

Fascinating. Had never heard of such a thing. Naturally, my mind went straight to the Mini Kellys and Balenciaga Bel Airs of the world (both on my current wishlist btw if anyone is asking).

I want to go on record saying that I find the tension between small vs. big bags to be healthy for the community. The ecosystem **needs** both micro baguettes and firetruck-sized totes.

But I couldn’t stop wondering: **does the hemline theory hold in handbags?**

>**Hypothesis:** handbags get smaller in good economic times and larger in worse economic times.

If you’re curious, the 👗 hemline theory 👗 [isn’t a serious indicator](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-hemline-index-and-it-accurate-recession-indicator) (which you probably already guessed lol) BUUUUUT it’s a fun idea, sue me.

# i should’ve paid more attention in high-school econ

Pretending I read more than one Economist article per year, I said, “I can totally get to the bottom of this.”

This [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryResaleData/comments/1ooonqb/what_134k_resale_handbag_listings_says_about/) has the full breakdown so I'll spare you here, but it was a J O U R N E Y.

# reject the null hypothesis!!!! (…or whatever 💅)

I analyzed **133,523 sold listings** from The RealReal, Fashionphile, Rebag, Farfetch, MyGemma, etc., then figured out which were small/mini/chiquito/teensy weensy and which were large.

https://preview.redd.it/qj179iytigzf1.png?width=2552&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c1ba15372f7e4a45a39648811ab1f0a7c445c44

These graphs show how the share of large bags being sold changed month-to-month alongside U.S. unemployment in 2025.

**WOW. As unemployment creeps up (red), the share of large bags sold (blue) rises too** **and as employment lowers, smaller bags are sold more!**

Like a visual “hemline effect” for handbags BUH DUH CHHHH.

*I did a deeper breakdown for price tiers (with more charts yayyyyyy) in the* [*same Reddit post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryResaleData/comments/1ooonqb/what_134k_resale_handbag_listings_says_about/) *so abbreviating again here.*

The quick version is that **segmenting by price tier** controls for the fact that big bags already cost more, letting us see *actual* preference shifts instead of just spending differences.

We're **looking for high correlation (close to 1.0), low p-value (<0.05)**

|tier|correlation|p-value|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Macro (All Tiers)**|**0.71**|**0.031 ✓ (Significant)**|
|[**“Accessible” ($0–1k)**](https://secondsense.co/listings/louis-vuitton-drouot-shoulder-brown-c13eb6)|**0.72**|**0.029 ✓ (Significant)**|
|[**Med ($1–3k)**](https://secondsense.co/listings/louis-vuitton-montaigne-top-handle-brown-bb-b4aeb71d)|0.62|0.052 (borderline)|
|[**High ($3–6k)**](https://secondsense.co/listings/louis-vuitton-capucines-top-handle-brown-mm-b68d99)|**0.70**|**0.036 ✓ (Significant)**|
|[**Ultra ($6k+)**](https://secondsense.co/listings/louis-vuitton-capucines-top-handle-white-mini-f38a6894)|0.43|0.251 ✗|

# what this tells us 👛👜👛👜👛 (nothing lol)

If we *had* to say something, the data shows that **as unemployment ticks up, shoppers shift toward practical, bigger bags**, especially for the $0-$1k segment across both tests. This makes sense to me as there's greater price sensitivity compared to an ultra-spend shopper who drops $45K at LV in one go and doesn't think twice.

It’s not a grand economic law, but if we were forced to make a call, the hemline theory might just extend to handbags, at least a little LOL. which is KINDA COOL!!!!!!! Idk to find a trend like this?!?! High correlation, low p-value!!!!!!! FUN STUFF.

But look babes, you can find correlations between the number of times my aunt says “hella” and the number of times I think about ordering a Diet Coke but force myself to order water instead. Like what about ice cream sales and shark attacks? Or [Nicolas Cage movies and swimming pool drownings](https://allaboutwork.org/2014/05/27/spurious-correlations-or-why-nicolas-cage-must-be-stopped/)? Those are actual high correlations we see in the wild but like come on.

# yay data! i need a nap

This is for funsies. It’d be super interesting to see what the data says back in 2021 when the economy was better and small bags were ALL THE RAGE, but I digress.

There are sooooooo many ways to measure the strength of the economy obvi (and even more interesting to me to think about strength and our perception of strength since those can differ!!!)

The fashion x data space excites me, gives me a giggle, and makes me stay up late writing python and thinking about hemline theory. So if you made it this far, **thank you for reading** and for humoring me.

1op5zep,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1op5zep/the_paradox_of_approaching_women_in_2024_seeking/,The paradox of approaching women in 2024 - seeking genuine perspectives,"I've been reading a lot about dating and there seems to be this impossible paradox:

Women say: ""We want men to approach us in real life, dating apps suck"" Also women: ""I'm so tired of being hit on everywhere I go""

Men say: ""I don't want to be creepy or bother anyone"" Also men: ""I'll regret not shooting my shot""

I understand both perspectives, but where does that leave us? Some specific scenarios I'm confused about:

**Bookstore/Coffee Shop:** She seems interesting, reading a book I love. Do I:

* Say something about the book? (But she's probably just trying to read)
* Leave her alone? (But maybe she'd actually enjoy meeting someone over shared interests)

**Gym:** We've made eye contact a few times, she smiled once. Do I:

* Approach after her workout? (But gyms are notorious no-go zones)
* Never do anything? (But what if she's actually interested)

**General public spaces:** See someone attractive, seems approachable. Do I:

* Try to strike up natural conversation? (Risk being the 10th guy today)
* Walk away? (Miss potential connection)

I think the core issue is: How do you show interest without being another burden on someone's day? How do you read the difference between ""please talk to me"" and ""please leave me alone"" when both might involve the same polite smile?",5,1762356711.0,dating_advice,26,0.61,False
1op5yyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivatedMindset/comments/1op5yyx/day_127_clean_the_brutal_truth_about_porn/,Day 127 clean: The brutal truth about porn addiction recovery nobody tells you,"**You're not weak, you're neurologically hijacked. Here's how I actually broke free after 7 years.**

For years, I thought I had zero self-control. Every night I'd promise myself ""last time,"" and every morning I'd wake up feeling like shit—drained, ashamed, foggy. I'd make it 3-4 days, then relapse harder. The cycle felt permanent.

Then I learned something that changed everything: I wasn't weak. My brain had been rewired by supernormal stimuli that evolution never prepared us for. Modern porn delivers dopamine spikes 200-400% higher than actual sex. Your brain can't tell the difference between pixels and reality—it just knows it's getting flooded with reward chemicals.

**Here's what actually worked:**

**The 72-Hour Hell Zone:** Days 1-3 are pure neurochemical withdrawal. Your brain is screaming for its dopamine fix. I had to physically leave my apartment during high-risk times—coffee shops, gym, libraries, anywhere public. The urges peaked around day 2, then started dropping. Just knowing this helped me push through.

**Replace, Don't Erase:** You can't just delete a habit. When urges hit, I'd immediately do 50 pushups or take a freezing shower. The physical shock reset my nervous system. Sounds extreme, but desperation works.

**Nuke Your Triggers:** Website blockers, phone out of bedroom, deleted Instagram (those ""suggested"" posts aren't innocent). I treated my environment like substance abuse recovery—because neurologically, that's what this is.

**The Game-Changer: Accountability That Actually Works:** This is where I'd always failed before. I'd try to white-knuckle it alone, then relapse in secret. What finally worked was having real-time accountability. I found this app that tracks your progress and sends you reminders during your high-risk hours. It's not some AI bullshit—it's designed specifically for breaking addictive patterns. Watching my streak grow became its own dopamine reward, and during those brutal first weeks, having something ping me right when I was about to relapse literally saved me multiple times. I also joined [r/pornfree](/r/pornfree/) and [r/nofap](/r/nofap/) for community support.

**The Chaser Effect:** This one saved me. After a relapse, I'd binge for days thinking ""already failed, fuck it."" Learning this pattern had a name helped me stop the spiral. One slip doesn't erase weeks of healing. Your brain is literally rewiring during clean days.

**The withdrawal was brutal.** Brain fog, irritability, couldn't sleep, felt depressed for two weeks. But around day 21, something shifted. Energy came back. Anxiety dropped. I could look people in the eye. By day 90, I felt like a different person—sharper, more confident, actually present in conversations.

**Real talk:** This addiction doesn't just steal your time. It steals your energy, your focus, your ability to connect with actual humans. Every hour in that cycle is an hour you're not building the life you want.

The shame keeps you trapped. The secrecy keeps you sick. The belief that ""this is just who I am"" keeps you stuck.

But you're not stuck. Neuroplasticity is real. The same pathways that got hijacked can be rewired. Usually takes 90 days minimum for significant changes, sometimes 6-12 months for full reboot, but it's absolutely possible.

I'm not gonna bullshit you—it's hard. I still get urges sometimes. But now I have tools, not just willpower. I understand my triggers. I've built a life where I don't need the escape anymore.

If you're reading this and feeling that pit in your stomach because you relate too hard—start today. Not Monday. Not next week. Right fucking now.

The person you're supposed to be is on the other side of this.

The app I used [This app](https://unnionapp.page.link/QsVV)—it's basically a reminder system that pings you during your vulnerable hours. Sounds simple, but when you're in that autopilot mode at midnight, a well-timed notification can snap you out of it.

The tier list is just who I got worldbulding on currently. 

So, this AU is a Hero/Villain AU cause I SAID SO >:D

I've got a few notes on what the roles of some characters are, but not all of em, so I'll just put up what I've got (Pleaaasee please pleaaase don't steal my ideas this took soooo long to think up)

TCO - Redeemed Villain | Reformed Hero, tasked to detain the rising villain known as 'The Dark Lord'/'Arachnid'

TDL - Villain, was inspired by the once-great villain 'The Chosen One'/'Pyro'. Only ever got to meet the guy after he redeemed himself.

Victim - TCO's Task Overseer, possibly a traitor to the Hero Organization (It'll get a name later, trust) under the Grey Villain's name as 'Hacker'.

Purple - Kid of two amazing heroes, originally known by the public as 'Mercury', he's less-known now, but still. His mother, Orchid/'Venus', died fighting a villain, and his father, Navy/'Neptune', retired soon after. He escaped from his father's clutches and is now a vigilante that goes by the name of 'Prince' or 'Wings' (WIP names).

King Orange - Blames the Hero Corporation for not being able to save his son but still managed to infiltrate it. He leads 3 lives. One as 'King', an infamous vigilante, another as 'Arthur', a higher up research/tech at the Hero Corporation, and his final one as 'Mango'. A guy who runs a coffee shop with his adoptive son.

TSC - Likely a hero's apprentice assigned to TCO, though he also has a second identity as a vigilante in a team known as 'The Kaleidoscope'. It is thought to be this powerful underground Organization but it's really just a group of teens.

Mercs - Bodyguards of the Hero Corporation probs idk

Color Gang - Not details for anyone specific past TSC and Purple, but they are also vigilantes under 'The Kaleidoscope'.

  
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Tbh maybe Mitsi died in an attack from when TCO was still a villain, or maybe newly redeemed and he couldn't save her, but who knows.",1,1762356679.0,AlanBecker,0,1.0,False

She was referred to me by a friend, I hit her up for coffee, we hit it off and hung out all throughout that week, I throw parties because I used to be in a frat but I’m still socially connected and on the Friday of that first week we went to a party and she had already been to two of them that week and the week before. That party did not go well, I got stuck doing damage control, my homies were tripping on me, women came up to her to talk shit on me, it was a lot. She left early, I pulled up on her afterwards to talk about what happened. We made up. 2 days later I’m planning a date and she cancels the meet up and basically says she doesn’t see our relationship being positive after the party on Friday. (Again she had gone to two other parties which weren’t as big and we had a fantastic time.)

Fast forward a week and it’s Halloween she calls me around 1am I call her back around 3 and she says she couldn’t stop thinking about me all week and knew that it wasn’t enough time to make a true judgment about me. We make up, I see her the next day, it’s great and we talk about being exclusive so I feel more motivated and she feels secure. Monday was great, we spent time, all of that, we have had conversation about our attachment styles and decided I’m anxious and she’s avoidant and I did a bunch of research on this dynamic.

This where I need advice. I have been in very deep relationships, nearly proposals, I have lived with multiple partners and I know how things can generally go, despite that I’m going at her pace and how she wants it. I am trying my best to self soothe when I get anxious and give her space and come up with ideas about how I can create spaces where she feels safe and we can get closer.

The thing is, she does not seem to do this, I can not name one time when she’s asked to see me, save maybe inviting to sit with her between classes which is a sweet gesture and I take her up on it but it’s not intentional if ykw I mean. Like it’s not out of her way. And for me every time I’m trying to make our interactions interesting so she doesn’t feel like she’s wasting her time. Idk why I feel like I need to do that, she literally came back to me and I still for some reason cannot tell she’s into me expect when she lets me kiss her or show PDA. 

She swears she’s being intentional and she’s trying and that even trying to get to know me is a lot for her. Does anyone have advice on how to pace myself? How do I fall into her rhythm and feel like what we’re doing is the right speed and right direction while being so jaded?

I’m not confused and I know there may be red flags but we all have them and I’m not the type to give up cuz ‘it just isn’t working out’ that’s lazy as hell.  

TLDR: this girl I’m seeing is avoidant attachment and I’m anxious attachment and we work really well but can’t seem to stay on the same page because a difference in dating preference and experience.

We texted a few times and I felt like we were really getting along. At the end of october last year I asked her if she would like to get coffee sometimes. I didn't say it's a date or nothing, just hanging out, but you know, I would be lying if I said I wasn't actually just asking her out on a date. She said ""we can talk about this at some other point"" (sounds kinda weird in english, this is the best way I could translate it) which I took as a friendly rejection, like she doesn't want to say no to not make me feel as bad.

After that we stopped talking as much, considering it became a bit awkward for the both of us but around september she started texting me again. Not as frequently as last year and mostly about university stuff. Last week though we texted a bit more about casual stuff, like how things are going, what are we doing in our free time nowadays and stuff like that which felt kinda odd for me considering that for the past month we mainly talked about university stuff and helping out with group projects.

I'm part of a group that organizes board game events for the university and she asked me about that so we talked about that a bit and she told me that she would love to come to the next one which is two weeks from now. Now I'm open to the idea that she just wants to be friends and she just wants to be closer again as friends but also, I do have feelings for her and I just can't ignore that. Now I though about bringing up the coffee stuff after the event but I don't know if that's the best course of action. I talked about this with a good friend of mine and he also said that I should bring up having a coffee sometime again but I don't want to come off as too forward, especially considering that we don't talk as much as we used to.

1op5wgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KarmaWillGetYa/comments/1op5wgz/rbn_post_on_retirement/,RBN post on retirement,"Saving this post as getting an error posting to RBN, but in response to what are you going about retirement as someone abused as a child and having cut off your parents/family for the most part?

I made quite a few financial mistakes after leaving home and going NC.  It was a combination of the freedom to be able to live and spend money how I wanted for once, trying to make up for the abuse but not really knowing how to manage money well (credit cards can be dangerous).  And losing a few jobs, being unemployed, moving around often, etc.  On the plus side, I made some friends that helped me here and there in return for helping them (pet sitting, baby sitting, errands, etc.) as I got back on my feet a few times.  Even my friends weren't always the best at managing money but we helped each other out and that counted. I also got taken advantage by a few acquaintances because I was a people pleaser and thought I was paying it forward for those that had helped me.  Ugh - be careful here.

I really wish I knew then what I know now... which I will list below but most importantly to save and invest money as early as possible.  Compounding interest is amazing especially the earlier you start saving.  Even at 4 or 5% which is what you'd get in most savings accounts and CDs today (it's been much higher in the past, sigh).

Nowadays, I've learned to save and budget and manage money better.  Not always the best.  But I started loosely following some of the Dave Ramsey's ideas like having an emergency fund, saving up to pay cash for  car, paying down debt (still working on that one), etc.  The emergency fund has helped me through some tough times, layoffs, etc. but barely.  But it kept me from being homeless and having to go back home to THEM.

As for retirement - long way off yet but I'm putting away all I can in savings/investments while still having a little fun money for a vacation or a couple nice treats here and there.  And reading up on all kinds of ways to manage these things.

My biggest advice:

* Track all your finances and monitor monthly.
* Learn all you can about financial management, retirement, savings, etc.  I know its boring but we don't have parental types to guide us, nor are we likely to get any sort of inheritance.  But we have the Internet at our fingertips.  There's some good subreddits on all this too. A little bit of knowledge here goes a long way.
* Find ways to increase your income - more education/training, change jobs/careers, move up in your job, be a hard worker.  Take on side jobs, especially when you're younger and can do more active jobs like pet sitting, lawn work, etc.
* Pay off your credit card bills in full by the due date.  If you can't afford to do this, you can't afford to use the credit card (unless its an urgent emergency then have a plan to pay them off asap as the interest on a balance and/or late fees are HUGE)
* Have an emergency fund in a HYSA where it will earn a little interest and you can access it quickly.  Work up to 6 months of living expenses in case you get laid off, but you can use this for emergencies like medical or other urgent bills but plan on refilling the fund asap
* Learn to budget and do it.  Track your  spending.  Make adjustments where needed.  Have some budget for fun things too but keep an eye on it.  
* Cook as much as possible at home.  Same for things like coffee and alcohol if you buy them out often.  It's okay to go out to a nice dinner here and there as a treat but it really adds up.  Also - don't use DoorDash/Uber Eats/grocery delivery unless you really are unable to go pick things yourself  - the overheard costs on these things are huge.  If I want takeout, I go and pick it up myself. Learn to cook similar foods at home much cheaper.  Splurge on appliances that make it easier like an air fryer and Instapot, a good mixer, blender, etc.  Learn to coupon shop and look for sales when shopping too and try to eat as healthy as possible.  
* If your employer offers a 401k or other savings plan that matches, use it.  

As for what do do when I get old, I am still working on that.  But we are not alone as there are many others (not abused too) trying to answer this too, especially when money is scarce.  I am hoping to eventually move somewhere after I retire where it won't be as expensive, hopefully a community with other likeminded people that will look out for each others as we age.  Or maybe go aboard where as an expat where it may be cheaper.   

I might end up having to have a roommate or two (which I have had in the past) so I'm keeping good habits on being a good roommate (cleaning up after yourself, keeping to routines, etc.)  I am also looking at jobs I might like to do into retirement that might earn some $$$  - haven't looked hard yet, but I have some ideas.  Or I may volunteer at places that might lead to a part time job too.   Or I'll keep playing the lottery and maybe win some money that might help. 

But overall, doing all I can to NOT end up back at home again and NOT end up like them - being miserable.",1,1762356530.0,u_KarmaWillGetYa,0,1.0,False

After the emotional deep dive of Scorpio, the universe more or less hands you a backpack and sends you outside. Touch some stars. This is the season of reckless optimism — the sort where you book a flight you should’ve thought twice about, or text “I miss u” with no actual plan. And honestly? That’s the point. The energy of Sagittarius is not about being perfect; it’s about being alive. It reminds you that curiosity is a muscle — and, well, lately you’ve let leg day slide.

So say yes. Say yes to adventure, whether that be trying out a new coffee shop or walking home via another route. Say yes to the people who make you laugh so hard your ribs get bruised. Say yes to ideas that make you a little scared. The universe is usually quite a fan of the audacious “why not. Of course, fire burns fast — so be on the lookout for overpromising, oversharing or running purely on adrenaline. But if you can harness that spark without letting it burn down your sanity, you’ll hit the sweet spot where freedom intersects purpose.

This is hard, I never expected myself to vent in a place like this, but I really need to. Maybe I'm not super old but I never in my 26 years old life had such a strong crush like this, I even thought Ill never feel it anymore. I rarely have crushes, sure, I like people visually but when I have a crush on someone, even objectivly the most attractive person in the world wouldnt be attractive to me, its always the person I like that is the most attractive to me. I had some small crushes before, not because the look but because those people were unique/creative, I also had a girlfriend 5 years ago but it wasn't good, I wasn't even friends with her but I tried my best until she ended it up to live with my friend haha (but that's actually good, 1 week later everyone started to like me even though she said noone liked me). But I never said I loved her, it was her who initiated everything. Since then, my only crush was a pre-war actress, so I don't think this count. Unfortunetelly/fortunetelly 3 years ago I started meeting people online on some discord server, and there was a girl that was super simmilar to me in interests and in the way she thinks. Few months later we started to send each other gifts, she lived in a different country than me but It was a lot of fun. We started to be friends and we didn't talk maybe a lot, but we talked from time to time and 2-3 times a year we were sending each other cards or gifts. For a short time I had a thought in my head that I think I have a crush on her, but I knew she probably likes only women, so I menaged myself to stop thinking about that. But something weird happened to me 3 months ago. Not sure how it exactly happened, but suddenly we started to text each other everyday, from morning to the night, she always asked me how did I sleep and wished me goodnight. Then we started to watch movies on the voicechat together, sometimes even 8 hours a day, sometimes even till the late night. Then she said she is not sure if she is 100% into women once, so I just couldn't help it and my feelings started to be huge. Once I felt lonely in a different city when I was traveling, I texted her I feel lonely. She sent me 20 euro and told me to buy myself a cake, a coffee and imagine she is with me. I started to cry and I still have sweaty eyes when I think about it. Since then I can't stop thinking about her and she appears in many of my dreams. The biggest thing came when she invited me to her halloween party. We actually met and I spent 5 days with her, we were doing a lot of stuff together and having fun. We even made photos as Morticia and Gomez and that made me feel crazy inside. Fortunetelly im a very shy person so probably I could hide everything and give 0 signals :( I wanted to tell her how I feel but instead we ended up walking around the park in silence for 30 minutes. I regret not telling her, but also I'm not sure if I should tell her. I dont want to break our friendship and what if she is really only into women and ill be disrespectful of telling her that, and that she will think I wasn't a good friend. On the party there was also her ex, i was slightly jellous or maybe sad im not so extraverted as her. We didn't have much time to say goodbye, but she said next time we will do more, so maybe next time will arrive one day. We still text each other, so probably she still likes me at least as a friend after seeing me irl, but I'm not sure if its the same, maybe im just overthinking. Since my return I just can't focus on anything, I miss her so much, and also I hate my thoughts, that I'm not a good friend. I never in my life had a crush on someone who was my friend before first. I started to have a crush on her even before I knew how she looks like, because I just fell for the character, for how creative she is or what she texted me. And in real life when we finally met, that was like a dream to me, she was exactly the same, but since we are both a bit silent we didn't talk as much as we could. I'm not sure if I should tell her what I think, or wait for another occasion when we will meet in real life again to tell her my feelings, or just forget. I don't want to lose her, since I met her my life started to be a better place and she always brought me joy with her gifts or kind words like noone else in my entire life, but I don't want to be direspectful as well and I feel bad that being just a friend stopped being enough for me :( And even if it would be, im afraid that one day she will meet someone and our time together will only a temporary thing, and she will stop talking to me that often. Sure, i want her to be happy and it wouldn't be anything bad. I just never knew anyone like this and there is so much to think about for me.",3,1762356180.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

1op5pbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophie/comments/1op5pbs/why_morality_kills_subjectivity_an_attempt_at_a/,"Why Morality Kills Subjectivity: 
An Attempt at a Diagnosis of The Ideology of Moral Orders","In *Dialogues concerning Natural Religion*, Hume dismissed god’s concrete existence by questioning,

*But so near an approach we never surely can make to the Deity. His ways are not our ways. His attributes are perfect, but incomprehensible. And this volume of nature contains a great and inexplicable riddle, more than any intelligible discourse or reasoning.*[***\[i\]***](applewebdata://356F2A92-44C5-4BED-94ED-E8FB28FD6937#_edn1)

He instead elevated humans themselves into the position of making moral judgements, through  our sentiments,

*Nothing can be more real, or concern us more, than our own sentiments of pleasure and uneasiness; and if these be favourable to virtue, and unfavourable to vice, no more can be requisite to the regulation of our conduct and behaviour.*[***\[ii\]***](applewebdata://356F2A92-44C5-4BED-94ED-E8FB28FD6937#_edn2)

These sentiments here are not a first-person feeling, but ethical judgments made from the perspective of the entire community’s ethical order.  And the community's ethical order itself is allegedly established by individuals through experience. Accordingly, therefore, because they are part of the community, every individual bears full ethical responsibility for and secures the ethical order they have established. But problems arise here. How is this spontaneity of wholeness of the community possible? Sympathy, said Hume. But to what extent is a community a community, does it include every person and even every animal, or what? In other words, whose orders and community are these?

Let’s recall the story of Jean Valjean in *Les Misérables*; a poor guy was put into jail for stealing a loaf of bread for his sister’s starving children. Stealing was conceived by the novel’s community as immoral to the extent of breaking the law; it seems that he was not worthy of sympathy from the standpoint of those who put him in jail. Would the nephews think of him the same? Were poor Jean Valjean and his nephews not a part of the community? Who was in a position to judge all these?

Jean Valjean’s case was still explicit, but things are not always this straightforward in more delicate situations of moral judgements. One of the examples, often mentioned by Žižek, is buying Starbucks coffee. When you go to buy a Starbucks coffee, there will always be an option to pay a little bit more to help farmers in Colombia. Today, it means paying a little bit more for a greener package or services, or such. But the real way to help the farmer and the planet is to not exploit them in the first place, isn’t it? The products only gives us a false sense that we meet the standard of being ethical just for buying the products.

But in fact, no one was there to judge whether this was ethical or not. Morality is not in some metaethical domain, but in the social relations that construct the symbolic system. Humans, as the inconsistency of the system, are not born with goodness, but are shaped by the system, which tells us what is good and what is not, as if there exists an invisible warning light of action over our heads that turns red every time we do something that offends the moral order of society. This is nothing but a symbolic fiction, and so too is the sympathy of Hume. There is no universal sympathy as such that serves as a bond among all people in the same society. Jean Valjean and the law enforcement, the farmers in Colombia, and Starbucks, Hume as a philosopher and diplomat, and his contemporary country folks are not combined by the sympathy that grounds the social order. Because they are never equal. The concept of sympathy and morality in general serves only as a placeholder in the symbolic system. There is no innate sympathy of some sort, insofar as the sympathy is the ground of morality, but an intersubjective horizon; if there is no human, there would not be the concept of morality, it is meaningful only within the network of human interactions and shared symbolic expectations. So “moral sentiments” like sympathy are concepts very questionable at least.

What are they then? Ideology. This is how ideology works; you can tell from the fact that people behave as if there is some hidden law of morality that never actually existed anywhere but in our minds. This hidden law serves as a big other, a new god that beholds all. 

By returning to the big other, the subject is once again enslaved, back to the stage before Nietzsche. The subject is now the agent of the big other’s enjoyment that originates from our obeying the law. And to those who stick strictly to the law, the mechanism of this moral economy is driven by their desire, the desire to compete with the big other on enjoyment. This alienation of competing with something fictional, in this case the ideology of morality in general, captures and kills people without being noticed,

*We think that ideology is something blurring, confusing our straight view; ideology should be glasses that distort our view, and the critique of ideology should be the opposite, like you take off the glasses so that you can finally see the way things really are…This precisely is the ultimate illusion, ideology wasn’t simply imposed on ourselves, ideology is our spontaneous relationship to our social world.*[***\[iii\]***](applewebdata://356F2A92-44C5-4BED-94ED-E8FB28FD6937#_edn3)

And in this sense, we stay in morality not to really act morally, but to stay away from the truth that may shatter our illusion that ideology gives us, because truth hurts. It takes courage to really be free.

The easy way to ease the pain of truth is to transform morality into a certain kind of moral consumer product, like the extra payment for Starbucks and the green product fee. The consumers buying into these products know that this is not helpful to the exploited in the whole community of human being and nature as a whole. It is only helpful to themselves and to the exploiting power. The circulation of the enjoyment reinforce the whole process once and once again. Morality forbids not enjoyment but not being enjoyed enough; we have the duty to enjoy it if we want changes to happen; appeared freedom of choices of products is a channel back to enslavement. People who claim to agree and stick so tightly with these products, even to the point of not being able to leave them, are thus enslaved by them, and they are enjoying the enslavement themselves. 

The so-called moral sentiments are but a more delicate kind of Starbucks fee, which works only as a symbol of this perverted enjoyment. Hume rejected god as the beholder of our moral actions, but now the morality in general he proposed has become a new beholder, a new god. He did not propose freedom for us, but an ideology.

The only way out is to reach the state of destitution of subjectivity, that is, as Žižek remarked, 

*stepping out totally of the domain of symbolic identification, canceling or suspending the entire field of symbolic authority, the field of big other. Of course, we can’t know what God expects from us, because there is no god.”*[***\[iv\]***](applewebdata://356F2A92-44C5-4BED-94ED-E8FB28FD6937#_edn4) 

Our only way out is to recognize that there is no big other. As Jesus said, “I bringth here not peace, if you don’t hate your father or your mother, then you are not my follower.[\[v\]](applewebdata://356F2A92-44C5-4BED-94ED-E8FB28FD6937#_edn5) In this case, family relations as a signification of the social hierarchy system is what gives a sibling a symbolic position. The saying reveals not an abetment to murder one’s parents, but a metaphor, which shows that the termination of any symbolic authority is itself good news. It means you are left alone with your freedom. 

Nietzsche said, “Gott ist tot.” It is not just a calling for ending the oppression of human nature by Christian morality, but that is not anything that could be a god in the first place. There are only subjects that search for guaranteed meaning and a point of reference when there is none. Only with the awakening from the illusion of subjectivity can we say, god is really dead, for the “I” lives.

1op5p91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1op5p91/autopsy_of_a_hunter_a_goowenyein_story/,Autopsy of a Hunter (A Gooweny-Ein story),"Dr. Bedi cleaned his glasses and rubbed his eyes. He’d love to be tucked in his bed next to his wife right now, but Sargent Aziz had asked him to come in early as a special favour. Apparently, there was an “odd” case that needed urgent attention.  
  
Bedi looked through the tiny breakroom window. He could see blue poking through the night sky. It could be the first sign of sunrise, or it might just be light pollution. It was too early, at any rate. Sargent Aziz would owe him one.  

With one final sip of his coffee, it was time for Bedi to get to work. He went into his “office” as he liked to call it - never mind the plaque on the door that read “morgue”.

The guest of honour that the Sargent had made such a fuss over was already there, ready for his autopsy. The guy didn’t have much of a file yet. Still, Bedi quickly glanced over what information he had.

From what Bedi could gather, the deceased was an investment banker who worked in a skyscraper out on Bloor Street. The man was also an avid hunter —a weekend warrior —going on multiple remote trips with his friends every year—the type you need to fly in and out of.

He was found deceased in his apartment by police after the neighbours reported hearing gunshots. Apparently, the man had been living like a recluse and acting “strangely” for nearly five months.

He was found with injuries to his head, as well as injuries to his chest and eyes that the Sargent was particularly interested in. Apparently, those wounds were what made this case so strange.

Well, it was Bedi’s job to look at those injuries and find out what killed this guy.

Bedi washed his arms with the abrasive soap that made his hands feel all nice and smooth, donned his PPE, and grabbed his voice recorder.

“Autopsy started at” Dr. Bedi checked his watch, “5:56 am. Deceased is Hugo Leveque, male, appears to be of European descent, age sixty-four.”

Bedi turned off his recording. “Poor fellow, you didn’t even make it to retirement.” He said with a sigh as he looked at the corpse, which was missing part of the top of his head. That made it an easy candidate for ‘most probable cause of death’.  
  
It wasn’t the only potentially fatal wound, though. The body had also already been vivisected right down the middle, as if someone had already started the autopsy. His eyes were missing, too.

Bedi was starting to understand why the Sargent had found this case so unnerving, and why he had been so anxious for answers. People didn’t usually cut themselves open like this. But maybe this wasn’t the wound the Sargent had talked about; perhaps someone else had started an autopsy, and Bedi was just being called in to finish up. It certainly looked that way…

“Hey Nina!” Bedi called out to the only other person working in that part of the hospital. Nina was a lab tech who worked in forensics. She’d been called in to run some samples from the same case.

Nina was a lovely woman, Bedi got along well with her, but he always thought she looked like a mouse whenever she poked her head into a room. It was a combination of her beady eyes, thin features, and the way she clasped her hands and looked around so timidly. “Yes, Aarav?” She said.

“No one else has started examining Mr. Levesque, right?”  
“No, he was brought in like that.”

“Hmm…strange,” Bedi said as much to himself as to his coworker.

When it became clear he had nothing more to ask, she closed the door and returned to her own duties, leaving him alone with the corpse.

Bedi turned on the voice recorder in his blue latex gloves, examining the body's exterior closely.

Rigor Mortis had just started to set in, while vitals from the medics indicated Algor Mortis was already underway. Pallor Mortis was complete. That all suggested death had probably been maybe two or three hours ago. That lined up with when the police indicated the neighbours had heard gunshots…

*Gunshots*, Bedi mouthed, examining the head wound. It didn’t look like the deceased had shot himself twice, but maybe he’d missed the first time, or fired a practice one.

*Your job is to find out what has happened to the body, not how many shots were fired around him*, he reminded himself, refocusing on the corpse before him.

A quick inspection of the deceased's nails revealed that they’d been worn and broken, as if the man had been digging into something. Bedi pulled out a magnifying glass; beneath the nail, there was dark brown detritus. Grabbing his tweezers, he pulled it out and looked at it under a microscope. Wood. Hardwood – maybe from a floor? It seemed like the man might have tried to dig or break through something, or was dragged, and was trying to cling to something for dear life. Bedi added his observations to his voice recording.

Then Bedi inspected the cuts around Mr. Levesque’s eyeless orbits. They’d been made proficiently by…something, Bedi couldn’t identify what. Strangely, they were healed, leaving behind shiny red scars that looked about six months old.

 So, half a year ago, the man had violently lost both eyes, and now he was dead under odd circumstances. Hmmm.

 Something about the timeline jarred Bedi’s memory. He quickly flipped through the medical records, anxious to check his hunch.

Yes! Back in July, Mr. Leveque had been airlifted to a hospital in Edmonton. The file had no details on what injuries the man had sustained beyond a vague “face injury” – Bedi would need to get more information from the Alberta Health Services – but it did state he had been on a hunting trip to Nahanni National Park. Oh dear! It appeared he’d been the only survivor on a group trip. According to the ranger reports, there was a suspected polar bear attack.  
Odd, Bedi thought. The scars didn’t look like they came from a polar bear claw. They looked like a person had plunged a saw or something into each socket.

Bedi looked for more medical notes, but from the looks of things, Mr. Leveque declined any further follow-up.

“So,” Bedi said, looking at the corpse with compassion, “you’ve had a rough year.”  Bedi could see the odds and ends of Mr. Leveque’s story coming together. The man was alone, traumatized, potentially living with survivor’s guilt…but it was too early to reach conclusions. He needed to keep examining.

The gunshot wound occurred around the same time as death. It started at the back of the pallet, then went up through the brainstem, taking out large portions of the cerebellum and the occipital lobe, as well as some of the temporal lobe, before it exited through the cranium. The shot would have been fatal, but before Bedi could confirm that this was indeed the cause of death, he needed to check that nothing else had killed Mr. Leveque first. That meant he needed to check the cut in the chest cavity.

That wound was made around the same time as the head wound. It was done with surgeon’s precision, using a blade that must have been razor-sharp. Such cuts through the sternum usually required a saw, but here there was an even, single line that looked as if it had been made as easily as a painter strokes pigment onto a canvas.

 As he used grips to open the chest cavity, Bedi could see that the bones inside were fractured – pulverized, really, but from the outside the wound was so neat and clean…

Something suddenly caught Bedi’s eye. It was shiny and small, reminding him of cat’s eye marbles that he used to play with as a child back in India, but the dark center shape was rectangular, like a goat’s iris. He reached in, trying to grab it. He was starting to think this looked more like a torture turned staged suicide. Had Mr. Levesque maybe met a different kind of monster up North?

All the breath left Bedi when he saw the object disappear. No – blink. It *was* an eye.

Before he could pull his hand out of Mr. Levesque’s chest cavity, something grabbed Bedi’s wrist tight enough that he could feel the tiny bones at the end of the radius crush. He screamed in terror and pain as he tried to yank his arm free. Whatever this was, it held him there, trapped him like a rabbit in a snare. Bedi could hear a terrified Nina calling for him and frantically attempting to open the door, yet some supernatural force barred it shut.

Slowly, a being emerged out of Mr. Levesque's body as if lifted by a platform under a trap door. It was as if the hole in the corpse was a doorway down to the depths of what the Abrahamic religions called hell.

The being had no eyes where a normal human’s were, yet two goat’s eyes on its chin, and a hideous smile that crossed its pallid face. As it rose, it let go of Bedi’s arm, but by this time Bedi was too afraid to do anything but fall backward onto the floor, eyes wide in awe and fear.

The being stood there, oddly elegant in its upright posture and brown suit. Its bald head looked dull and sickly in the morgue’s harsh fluorescent lighting. It gently wiped some guts off its shoulder and dropped them on the tiled gray floor before dismounting the autopsy table in one large step.

Then, it looked at Dr. Bedi, cocking its head as if examining him, before reaching back into Mr. Leveque to pull out a brown bowler hat. The monster put it on his head, adjusted it, then politely tipped it before walking over to the window and crawling out into the wider world.

When Bedi recovered from the shock enough to regain control of his body again, he scurried for the white landline phone in the corner of the morgue.  
A children’s rhyme from his childhood kept repeating in his mind:

*You see him once, there’ll be nowhere to hide*

*When you see him twice, he climbs inside*  
  
“Pick up, pick up, pick up!” He muttered anxiously to himself as he listened to the phone ring on the other side of the line.  
“Yes?[”](https://) a man answered.

“Sargent Aziz, it's Dr. Bedi.” his voice filled with urgency. “Don’t let anyone watch any surveillance tapes of Mr. Levesque's apartment. Stay away from that place!”

“Why…?” Aziz started to ask, confused.  
“ I think I just saw the Gooweny-Ein.” Bedi replied.

 It dawned on him why Mr. Levesque’s eyes had been cut out. If even that hadn’t spared that poor man, then Bedi realized he was truly doomed.",1,1762356072.0,stayawake,1,1.0,False

# I  have always been a lover of knowledge and wisdom. I've loved gleaning new insights and perspectives about the world, enrichening my understanding of a new subculture and weaving more details into my mental models.

I love the accompanying novelty rush on learning something new. I love the satisfaction of having articulated an interesting thought. The digestion of new information always excites me.

Having said that, I am not in the least interested in going back to college. Formal education kills the excitement of learning and instead burdens with various tensions like exams, grades, assignments, deadlines and so on. I love learning free and unencumbered from it.

I've always thought learning begins more after leaving school or college. I would like to connect with other people who have a similar mindset - discuss our daily systems and habits to stay in touch with learning about the world

I realised how much I love learning about things while discussing books with somebody and revisiting my non fiction collection. I have books on all kinds of curiosities - ranging from the history of colour to the reason the English alphabets are organised in the order they are (not phonetically like most languages).

I would love to interact with people who have similar passions and exchange good articles and insights everyday with each other - and feed our interest further.

Subjects I like learning about

* Mathematics - I love Mathematics. I don't have as much time to keep up with it actively now, but I do read articles on Quanta to keep up with latest development.
* Programming - I love participating in programming contests
* Chess - I am not very good in chess, but I love it. I have so many books on chess that I still have to read ! I follow various YouTubers on it
* Reading - I do like reading books - both fiction and non fiction.
* Sports Trivia - The way I consume sports is through remembering and analysing trivia. I find it fascinating that almost every sporting event will lead to something happening that has not happened before.

There are various other topics I am interested in - even if I am not an expert in them like psychology, history, international affairs and so on.

Mediums I like to keep track of information from

* Podcasts - I do love listening to podcasts. I recently heard a podcast about the differences between natural an lab made diamonds and learnt about the economics of the jewellery industry. I listen to podcasts about science outreach, international affairs an a few fictional ones too in my native language.
* Books
* Blogs - I follow some blogs like Quanta
* Magazines - I have subscriptions to MIT Technology Review, Wired and New in Chess. I also follow some free magazines like IEEE Spectrum and Resonance.
* Reddit - I try to curate my feed to get new bits of information now and then. I have found out about things as esoteric as a world coffee championship through Reddit.

I love organising things I learn in notes in beautiful ways. I maintain notes about it - though I am not always regular in updating it. I would love to know about different systems other people have and learn more.

I look forward to getting to know you.",1,1762356061.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1op5ope,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1op5ope/autopsy_of_a_hunter_a_goowenyein_story/,Autopsy of a Hunter (a Gooweny-Ein story),"Dr. Bedi cleaned his glasses and rubbed his eyes. He’d love to be tucked in his bed next to his wife right now, but Sargent Aziz had asked him to come in early as a special favour. Apparently, there was an “odd” case that needed urgent attention.  
  
Bedi looked through the tiny breakroom window. He could see blue poking through the night sky. It could be the first sign of sunrise, or it might just be light pollution. It was too early, at any rate. Sargent Aziz would owe him one.  

With one final sip of his coffee, it was time for Bedi to get to work. He went into his “office” as he liked to call it - never mind the plaque on the door that read “morgue”.

The guest of honour that the Sargent had made such a fuss over was already there, ready for his autopsy. The guy didn’t have much of a file yet. Still, Bedi quickly glanced over what information he had.

From what Bedi could gather, the deceased was an investment banker who worked in a skyscraper out on Bloor Street. The man was also an avid hunter —a weekend warrior —going on multiple remote trips with his friends every year—the type you need to fly in and out of.

He was found deceased in his apartment by police after the neighbours reported hearing gunshots. Apparently, the man had been living like a recluse and acting “strangely” for nearly five months.

He was found with injuries to his head, as well as injuries to his chest and eyes that the Sargent was particularly interested in. Apparently, those wounds were what made this case so strange.

Well, it was Bedi’s job to look at those injuries and find out what killed this guy.

Bedi washed his arms with the abrasive soap that made his hands feel all nice and smooth, donned his PPE, and grabbed his voice recorder.

“Autopsy started at” Dr. Bedi checked his watch, “5:56 am. Deceased is Hugo Leveque, male, appears to be of European descent, age sixty-four.”

Bedi turned off his recording. “Poor fellow, you didn’t even make it to retirement.” He said with a sigh as he looked at the corpse, which was missing part of the top of his head. That made it an easy candidate for ‘most probable cause of death’.  
  
It wasn’t the only potentially fatal wound, though. The body had also already been vivisected right down the middle, as if someone had already started the autopsy. His eyes were missing, too.

Bedi was starting to understand why the Sargent had found this case so unnerving, and why he had been so anxious for answers. People didn’t usually cut themselves open like this. But maybe this wasn’t the wound the Sargent had talked about; perhaps someone else had started an autopsy, and Bedi was just being called in to finish up. It certainly looked that way…

“Hey Nina!” Bedi called out to the only other person working in that part of the hospital. Nina was a lab tech who worked in forensics. She’d been called in to run some samples from the same case.

Nina was a lovely woman, Bedi got along well with her, but he always thought she looked like a mouse whenever she poked her head into a room. It was a combination of her beady eyes, thin features, and the way she clasped her hands and looked around so timidly. “Yes, Aarav?” She said.

“No one else has started examining Mr. Levesque, right?”  
“No, he was brought in like that.”

“Hmm…strange,” Bedi said as much to himself as to his coworker.

When it became clear he had nothing more to ask, she closed the door and returned to her own duties, leaving him alone with the corpse.

Bedi turned on the voice recorder in his blue latex gloves, examining the body's exterior closely.

Rigor Mortis had just started to set in, while vitals from the medics indicated Algor Mortis was already underway. Pallor Mortis was complete. That all suggested death had probably been maybe two or three hours ago. That lined up with when the police indicated the neighbours had heard gunshots…

Before switching to this grinder, I was using the most useless coffee grinder in existence, the Simplus one. Mga max of 6 coffee beans lang kaya kong i-grind dun at a time parang tanga. I have been trying to save money because I lost my job kaya I have been making cold brew at home. Nung bumigay na finally ‘yung Simplus, sa sobrang frustrated ko shinoot ala Kobe ko yan siya sa trash bin at umiyak. I don’t like violence, even the passive type, but seeing the Simplus break as I threw it broke something in me too. The pressure of just living life was getting to me. Umiyak ako sa sister ko who decided to order the Lahome electric coffee grinder for me. 

Fast forward to this morning, ginamit ko na ‘yung grinder for the first time. This is not an ad ha, pero shet ang bilis niya nagrind yung whole batch ko for the cold brew. Like 10 seconds. Ang ganda pa nung grind. Kuhang kuha gusto ko. 

I stood there for a whole ass minute, just dumbfounded. I deprived myself of this experience for three whole years kasi naisip ko masyadong OA if I bought a more expensive ish na grinder. 

And then I burst into tears. Bumuhos ‘yung frustrations ko for the past three months: the job search, the cutting off my mom, the trauma from my ex, all the other shitty things that has happened in my life so far. All I was thinking was, if I cut the cord agad agad and just jumped the gun much earlier than I did I would’ve saved myself all the heartache and stress. I should’ve seen the signs that the company was closing down and did my job search agad. I should’ve never given my mom another chance to break my heart. I should’ve left my ex the moment he swept our food off the table at a public place and screamed at me while people watched on. I should’ve thrown that stupid grinder away three years ago and got this grinder instead. 

Maybe it’s because I’m about to get my period. Maybe it’s because it’s that time of the year where my seasonal depression acts up again. Maybe it’s because I’m really really going through it right now. Whatever it is, I will eventually figure it out. But first, I’m going to enjoy my cold brew and hug my sister the first chance I get.

They believe a staph UTI triggered my IC. I've been in I guess what is considered a ""flare"" since day one, about a month now. UTI cultures negative, BV/yeast test negative, STD panel negative. Currently trying to get ureaplasma test but urologist refused, gyno admitted she didn't know what it was, on wait list for urogyno but it's months out. Also on a wait list for pelvic floor PT in my area. 

Azo makes me throw up. Uro-MP had zero effect. Taking D-Mannose because it's generally recommended but it hasn't decreased the pain. On a diet of potatoes, rice, unseasoned chicken/turkey and sometimes chicken soup. (I am allergic to red meat.) Cut out alcohol, sex, coffee, and even the chamomile tea I used to drink at night. 

Tried oxybutynin and famotidine for about the past 2 weeks, it has had no effect and I told my doctor I don't want to be on it much longer because I feel brain fog and have been forgetful and foggy. (The oxybutynin at least, famotidine just seems to be neutral) I also have IBS-C, so the doctor said they have to be extremely careful about what antihistamines to try me on - hydroxyzine is extremely constipating apparently so the doctor is currently avoiding it, they're trying I think cimetidine next. I previously tried amitryptiline for another chronic issue I have and it had severe mental side effects that nearly required involuntary committal. It's not an option, I wasn't functional or sane. 

I would say that my pain is 5-6/10 daily, and it's a fairly constant pain. Oddly I don't have much urinary urgency and wouldn't say I pee more frequently, it's JUST the pain. Sharp pain, burning/stinging/stabbing, sometimes localized to the urethra sometimes in the entire ""downstairs"" area. The only thing that even remotely helps is a heating pad between the legs. I've been researching peoples' methods for getting out of flares on this sub and nothing has helped at all. I stay in bed pretty much 24/7 with the heating pad, haven't left the house in days. 

Tell me the pain can eventually get better. Tell me it won't always be like this. It already feels like my life is over - some of the few pleasures I had left to me after my other chronic conditions decreased my QOL were a cup of tea (occasionally coffee, like once every 2 weeks) and a long soak in a hot tub/bath, I cut those both out - but is at least possible the pain might go down someday?",1,1762355849.0,Interstitialcystitis,5,0.99,False

This is a step by step of what will happen at PRDV

Monday 
Arrive at train station, some people will be lined up adjacent to Costa coffee, some outside the station at the front entrance. Doesn't really matter where you go, but I'd pick front of entrance so you can get on the coach first.

Approx. 30 minute drive to ITC Catterick, we had one guy get dropped off at the base and he got on the coach from the front entrance of the base.

Get off the coach, grab your bag then you'll be told to get in 3 ranks ( 3 lines). Then you will be showed to your accomodation, square away your stuff, get your bed sorted etc. you'll be told some introductory stuff then you'll get scoff, go through some PowerPoint classroom stuff.

Bed at 2200

Tuesday
Wake up at 0600
- we had some people that would wake up earlier like 10 or 20 mins, you don't need too, wake up at 0600, shit, shave, shower get sorted and be lined up in the corridor for 0625, 5 mins early of 0630

You'll get scoff then it's death by PowerPoint, you'll get shown some guns today, hold them etc. GPMG, SA80, Javelin, Glock etc.

Death by more PowerPoint

Powerpoint tells you about training schedule through basic, weapons used and specifics, para history and some about VC winners

You should research para history and general knowledge about them

Research about all para VC winners, names, dates, location and story, know what happened. You can find all the resources on YouTube if needed, you also get ample time to do research there but it's better if you already know that way you can just re-up your knowledge.

You will be tested on basic para knowledge and VC winners on Wednesday.

Get scoff

Bed at 2200

Wednesday

Wake up 0600

Make sure your water bottle is FULL, when you arrive to the gym they will check so don't drink any until you're allowed, keep it full.

You'll then do medball throw, mid thigh pull etc, it's easy can't muck it up

After is the 2km run - on your PRDV pack they say it could be bleep test, it's not they got rid of it

Do the 2km run under 8:25

Go back get scoff 

Then you'll probably do some studying until your tests

Bed 2200

Thursday

Wake up 0600

Forgot what you do, think you sit in a class room etc and do a very short interview they just say if u passed or not

If you failed the 2k run, you will fail
If you passed the 2k then you pass, provided youre not a bellend

Then you'll be given some food for your journey home then they will put u on a coach back to the train station around 11

This test is easy, the standards have been lowered since they got rid of PRAC, however the standards are the same at p coy so it makes no difference 

Have fun, it's basically free food and a 2k jog, it's fun, enjoy yourself.

Then one morning I decided to do only one small thing differently: I stepped outside with my coffee, stood in the sunlight for five minutes and just listened to my body rather than scrolling my phone. The next week my energy stayed steady. The month after that, my skin looked calmer, and I felt less worn out by the end of the day.

What really changed for me was how I thought about aging. Once I stopped trying to outrun time and started letting my habits support my body instead, everything shifted. I found a short read that explained how simple lifestyle choices influence aging much more than any expensive cream.

But in recent months, I’ve put a lot into my confidence and taking care of myself. The results since then have been insane. 

First, people are giving my princess treatment and perks like all the time, it’s sort of insane.

1. I went on a trip a couple months ago and basically from the time I got to the airport to the time I got home, people were insanely nice. On the flight out, the flight attendant got me wine and extra snacks and kept checking in asking if I wanted more. I put it down to them being nice but when I got to the hotel, they gave me a free upgrade. Then that evening, I was at a bar chatting with people and someone came in from outside to say my energy was just amazing. Before I got back to the hotel, I ran into a guy who started gushing that I looked like an actress and basically said I could own any room I walked into. He gave me recommendations for good bars and some free passes for drinks at spots he knew. The next night, I went out again and had basically the same thing happen. I got approached constantly and one group asked me to help wave down the bartender for drinks since I was such a natural at it (the bartender basically ran over the moment I got there lol). This guy started chatting with me and was talking about connecting me with some friends in the city and mentioned a yacht party the next night. Day 3 and stuff was about the same - getting a lot of looks and people hitting on me. Day 4, I actually had a woman sort of come onto me which was interesting and flirted with this really cute guy. Then the fight home again wound up with extra drinks and snacks.
2. Back home, I’m noticing this everywhere. At the bar I usually go to, they’ve started giving me free drinks for some reason. 
3. I was coming back from a yoga class and heading up the steps at the metro. This guy stopped what he was doing, loudly proclaimed “Oh my god she’s gorgeous” and motioned his friend to stop. I was so shocked I awkwardly said “Wait, me” and he kept gushing over me. It was insane. I think they thought I had earbuds in and seemed very flustered.
4. I was heading out for drinks with friends and this guy on the other side of the escalator just stopped and stared at me with his mouth hanging open.
5. A woman came up to me asking me to take a photo with her to show her kids. She was gushing about how beautiful I was.
6. Whenever I’m out for drinks or at a restaurant, I notice people sort of smile and warm up with me - like it’s a strange, noticeable shift.
7. My friends describe me as popular and beautiful which just feels surreal. Like I told my close friend how I felt self conscious and she flipped out about and told my face card was lethal and she didn’t know how anyone had hope if I felt bad. I also mentioned I was dressing up as a princess for Halloween to these girls I didn’t know well and they gushed about how much that fit my appearance and vibe. For one of the groups when we decided to do a group costume, they immediately decided I needed to be the pretty, sweet character. 
8. And I will say this, I’ve been ten times more sociable. I’ll chat with strangers, listen more, and just be more present. 

I have a way bigger social circle and genuinely amazing friends! When I was in college, I had a couple close friends (they’re still my friends and absolutely amazing), but now I have several big friend groups.

1.  I met a great trivia group and we meet up every week and hang out for brunch and such frequently. We’re also planning a group Halloween costume!
2. I met some nice girls in the city near me too and we go out for museum things, dinners together, house parties, shopping, and just hanging out. They’re genuinely amazing!
3. I’ve met a few other friends - a girl in a neighborhood near me and this really sweet girl at a dance class. 
4. My apartment neighbors are super nice. There’s a girl who joins me for coffee sometimes and she’s great!

Everything is just sort of working out in my favor. I keep getting these amazing opportunities, gifts, and such.

1. My mom went to a gala with a charity auction thing where you got tickets to win baskets. She used hers on several things but somehow won a vacation for the whole family she didn’t even enter.
2. I’ve practiced yoga for a few years and suddenly got some teaching opportunities. One class at my favorite studio, the instructor didn’t show and I randomly volunteered to step in so we could still have a class. The studio agreed and loved my class so much they’ve asked me to teach more. I also went to an outdoor pilates class and the hosts were very impressed with my form and inquired about me teaching.
3. My job is giving us more travel opportunities which is super exciting - including some overseas trips!
4. I met some other girls at an orchard and they invited me out for some Halloween things which is super exciting!
5. New one but my friend and I made a Halloween bingo card and everything I wrote happened. She even commented that it’s like I manifest things.

The past year, I’ve had some real health challenges and they’re significantly better. I gained some weight and struggled a lot with energy but things are improving quickly.

1. I don’t crave sugar much anymore and my appetite is super stable - I’ve already lost about 15 pounds
2. As I’ve lost weight, it’s going off my waist, face, arms, and legs while my hips and bust have stayed full so body is tea. 
3. I’m gaining a lot of core strength, flexibility, and grace with working out so I feel great about myself
4. I generally have great energy and focus through the day!

And a few random appearance things. 

1. I’ve always been self conscious about my nose. Last month I had a legit crash out and started researching plastic surgery and even got a nasal endoscopy (for those who don’t know, it’s basically the inside of your nose being checked with a pokey stick… not fun). Now this may seem really bad, but it actually helped me so much to voice and confront this head on. By finally saying how I felt and getting help from family, friends, and some internet strangers I realized how bad my BD was. I had people who had 0 reason to be nice to me about it tell me that I had a very attractive face and that a nose job would have little to no positive effect. Now I quite like my nose and find it pretty cute. And ironically, it’s started to look smaller and daintier as a result - funny how that works. 
2. My skin is a lot clearer. I listen to some subs for it but also improved my diet so it’s been far nicer and I get less hormonal acne.
3. My eyelashes and hair have been growing very fast. My hair, in particular, is growing crazy fast and has this really nice silky texture now. I went for a hair cut and the stylist was going on about how much she loves my hair texture and color and finds it so fun to style.
4. My whole face just looks more symmetrical and eye catching. I don’t know how to describe it but my skin is literally glowing and it’s really nice. 
5. I take a lot more pride in my appearance. I’m always a bit dressed up even if it’s just adding some jewelry, perfume, or lipgloss. 

So altogether, life has been on an up swing and everything feels sort of surreal right now. I don’t know how much is subliminals versus me finding more confidence but I think subliminals have certainly helped!",6,1762355564.0,subliminalsforever,3,1.0,False
1op5gur,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1op5gur/my_gp_kept_calling_my_pain_work_stress_i_pushed/,"My GP kept calling my pain ""work stress"", I pushed for tests and it turned out to be gallstones","

I’m 31F, desk job, not pregnant, generally healthy. Since May I’ve been having these weird upper right stomach pains that feel like a belt is yanking tight under my ribs. It hit like 3 or 4 times a week, usually after dinner, sometimes at 2 am and I would sit on the floor and try to breathe. I went to my GP in June, she said it sounded like “work stress and maybe reflux”, gave me antacids and a sheet on breathing practice. I tried. I cut coffee for a month, smaller meals, yoga at lunch. The pain kept coming. In August I asked again for tests. She asked about my mood, suggested SSRIs, told me to try a low FODMAP. I started to feel a little unhinged, like I was making it up with my brain.



Two weeks ago I had an attack after a very normal dinner, salmon and rice, and I threw up twice from the pain. My partner drove me to urgent care. The PA pressed under my ribs, I jumped. She said it might be gallbladder, ordered ultrasound and labs and wrote a short note for my GP. The ultrasound lady barely spoke but I saw her eyebrow go up. Next day the report said multiple stones, the biggest 9 mm, mild inflammation. I cried, partly from relief. I took that paper to my GP and she went very quiet, then said “good find”. I was polite, but inside I felt like a balloon that someone finally stopped sitting on.



I meet the surgeon next week to talk options. I am scared of surgery, but at least the pain makes sense now. Posting because I want to remind myself, and maybe someone here, that you can be calm and still ask again. You are not dramatic for wanting tests when your body is yelling. I wish I had pushed earlier. Also, if a doc only ever looks for anxiety in women, that is not a neutral pattern, that is a choice. I plan to switch clinics after this is done, I deserve a team that listens before writing a prescription for vibes.

1op5giw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1op5giw/the_dead_remembers/,The Dead Remembers.,"So, I never really believed in ghosts. Nothing paranormal to be exact, but my mother always told me ghost stories as a kid.

She’d whisper them in that low, warning tone, always ending the same way — *“The dead remember you if you look too long.”* I never understood what she meant, but I used to laugh about it. Now I can’t even think about those words without feeling cold.

It started a few months after she died.

I inherited her house — a sagging, two-story farmhouse in upstate New York that hadn’t been truly lived in since I left for college. I was there to clean it out, sell it maybe, but from the moment I pulled into the driveway, something about it felt wrong. Not haunted wrong. Just… off*.*

The air inside was stale in a way that felt alive. The floors creaked under my steps, not just from weight, but like they were reacting to me — like each groan was an acknowledgment.

The first night, I found her old mirror still hanging in the upstairs hallway. It was tall, framed in warped oak, and the glass had darkened around the edges. I remembered her using it every morning when I was a kid, brushing her hair, humming softly. 

I always thought that mirror looked really nice. Like something you would find out of an antique shop. But tonight, the sight of it made something uneasy twist in my gut, but I left it.

That was my mistake.

Around midnight, I woke up to a sound I hadn’t heard since childhood — that humming. Faint, distant, floating through the walls. It was unmistakably hers*.*

At first, I told myself it was the wind, or maybe the pipes. But as I sat up, the sound got louder, closer, like it was right outside my bedroom door.

Then it stopped.

The silence afterward was so complete it felt like pressure. My ears rang with it. I waited a long time before getting up, convincing myself I’d imagined the whole thing.

When I opened the door, the hallway light flickered — just once — and I caught a reflection in that mirror. A shape behind me, impossibly close. I spun around. Nothing. Just the dark stretch of the hallway and the open door to my mother’s room at the far end.

The mirror, though — it was *wrong.* The hallway reflected in it wasn’t the same. The wallpaper was peeling, the light dimmer, like I was looking a few decades into the past. And in the distance, in the reflection of my mother’s room, there was someone standing.

Not moving. Not facing me. Just *standing.*

When I looked down the real hallway, the room was empty.

I remember whispering something. Maybe her name. The figure in the reflection turned its head. Just the head. Slowly, like it had been waiting for me to speak.

I slammed my door and didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, I tried to be rational. Grief does strange things to people, and I’d been avoiding dealing with hers for months. The house was full of her things — her smell, her clothes, her photos. Maybe it was all just my brain breaking under the weight of it.

But as I went to make coffee, I noticed something that made my stomach turn: a strand of gray hair on the counter. Long. Exactly like hers.

I was alone.

That evening, I decided to cover the mirror. I took an old bedsheet and pinned it over the frame. The moment I did, I felt that awful, crawling tension lift just a little — like the air had exhaled.

But later that night, I woke again. The sheet was on the floor.

Not fallen. *Folded.*

There was a faint handprint in the dust on the mirror’s surface, like someone had pressed their palm flat against the glass from the inside.

And this time, I could see my reflection clearly — except, it wasn’t doing what I was doing.

I froze. My reflection blinked a beat too late, its expression slack, empty. Then its mouth started to move.

It was mouthing words, but there was no sound. I leaned closer, straining to read its lips, and though I couldn’t hear them, I knew exactly what it was saying.



The dead remember if you look too long.



The lights went out.

I don’t remember getting to the door. I must’ve run, but I have flashes — the sound of the humming again, the creak of the stairs as if someone was coming up behind me, that terrible awareness that I was not *alone.*

When I finally got outside, it was raining hard. I stood in the mud, staring up at that house, expecting to see her in one of the windows. But every one of them was dark.

Then, as lightning flashed, I saw movement behind the upstairs curtain — just a silhouette, head tilted, watching me.

I didn’t go back for two days.

When I did, the house was silent again. The mirror was uncovered, but this time the reflection looked normal. Just me, tired, pale, shaking. I almost laughed. Maybe the whole thing had been a breakdown.

Then I noticed something etched faintly into the glass — letters, carved so thin I had to lean close to read them.

It said: **“You shouldn’t have left.”**

That night, I dreamed I was standing in front of the mirror, but the reflection wasn’t copying me. It was facing away, its hands pressed against the glass like it wanted out. And then it turned, slowly, its face a blank stretch of skin where features should be — except for the mouth. My mother’s mouth.

When I woke up, the bedsheet I’d used to cover the mirror was on my bed, tucked around me like someone had draped it carefully in the night.

I moved out that morning.

That was two years ago. I thought I’d left it behind, but a few weeks ago I noticed something strange in my apartment. My reflection lags sometimes. Just for a second. When I blink, it doesn’t blink back immediately.

And a few nights ago, I woke up to that same faint humming coming from the bathroom — where the mirror hangs above the sink.

The sheet’s back on it now, but I know it won’t matter.

Because sometimes, when I walk past, I can see the outline of a hand pressed against the fabric, from the *inside.*",2,1762355522.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

In changing my ticket date there was no standard economy seats remaining, so i PAID for the premium economy ticket. this was about 4/5 days before the  new flight date.

Boarded the flight and right before dinner i was appraoched by the flight attendant for my side of the aisle and asked if i saw or had the menu, and what my meal option was. I said chicken, she then proceed to tell me that i might not get my first option so she suggested i choice another option just in case. I thought this was odd cause i travelled premium economy before but i said ok and went with the vegetarian option.

she came back with the food trolley and just for context IM SITTING IN ROW 11 the front row so idk why i would not have been able to get my chicken meal. She came with teh trolley and said she can offer me my chicken meal but i would have to wait until she served everyone in her aisle, again i'm in row 11 in the middle aisle which mean im the first person for my side that she would have to attend to. it felt like she was stringing me along but i still said yes i'll wait.

By this time alarms bells are going off because i dont just want to jumo straight to 'oh she's being racist' but just to safegaurd myself i took out my phoen and started recording becasue i needed to ask why i had to wait when i paid for my ticket just like everyone else.  When she came back down to me she said he collegue needed the chiken meal and she will check to shee if she still had it. Sigh!

Before she could ask her collegue i gently asked what was the reason for me not having my choice meal and why i had to wait. She said i upgraded my flight and so the other passesngers had priority over me. this woman said she could have checked back in standard economy for my meal (as though i didnt pay for my upgrade). I saidok but my blood was boiling at this point. she came back and said the chicken option was all out and i'd have to take the vegetarian option

i felt so humiliated because everyone else was eating and enjoying (well i guess) their meal lookign at me land probly wondering why i wasnt being served and i really did feel single out. I thought maybe that was their policy but after checking online adn speaking BA customer service, they said her actions were not  consistent with BA standards and they apologised and said i should file a complaint, which i did.

that whole experience made me feel small, teh way she stooped and to my sitting level and spoke as to say (listen here child) it was all too much. I thought i was over thinking until it was time for breakfast.

she came around with the trolley and said tea, coffee, juice? i dont drink coffee and dont drink tea so i asked for hot. She probly said 'sorry' like (what did you say) , then i repeated hot chocolate. I have requested hot choclocate before on BA even in standard economy and was goven hot chocolate. This lady looked me in the eye and and asked strirnly like shes speaking to a child 'TEA OR COFFEE!!'. I was so done, i just said apple juice then she smiled and poured me a cup of apple juice.

I wasnt the only black person in Premium economy but this encounter really shook me. Is this how they treat people they dont consider?? I think BA needs to do better with their staff . But am i wrong for feeling like there was something behind it, i still have the recording her explaining why I couldnt get my first option meal.",0,1762355483.0,BritishAirways,33,0.4,False

Genre: Romantasy","Heat bloomed beneath the fabric of her pyjamas, sharp and sudden, like spark catching skin. She gasped, her eyes flicking open. The room was dim, filtered in amber light through gauzy curtains and the air smelled faintly of cedar and cold rain. For a moment she forgot where she was, then the unfamiliar creak of the old ceiling reminded her. She had come to Delmoor with her aunt, where her mother used to live. It had been two days, yet the place had begun to feel like it as watching her. 
She lurched out of bed, staggering to her bedroom mirror as she carefully peeled off her pyjama top, wincing and gritting her teeth. As the fabric slid off, she turned, her back to the mirror, her stomach dropped. The mark had grown again. Last week it had been nothing more like a circular sigil on her left shoulder blade, but now, intricate, winding lines that looked almost like roots or veins, branching downwards along her spine.  The lines were darker, more defined, almost like letters, no not letters, symbols. Ancient ones. She traced it with shaking fingers, it was warm, alive. A tear scaped before she could stop it. She blinked it away, swallowing the lump in her throat. 
Three years of this, three years of watching the mark spread, of doctors shaking their hands, witches sighing at their failing spells and of Suzan crying when she thought Amari couldn’t hear. The only response she ever got was that an ancient witch had possessed her body. Four years and one month left, before her body is taken over and she dies.  
She turned back to the room and froze. Sheets of paper lay scattered across her bed like someone had thrown them in a fit. Her handwriting, jagged ink strokes, looping and uneven, covering every sheet. 
“What the hell?” She pulled one closer trying to read the text. The papers quivered slightly as, as much as she had no recollection of writing it, she lacked the ability to make sense of any sentence written. The structure though, resembled that of a witch’s spell, having spent enough time visiting them to recognize the writing. She snatched them up and shoved them into her drawer before her aunt could walk in and found her whispering nonsense to empty air again. 
A knock rattled on the door. “Amari? You awake?” Suzan’s voice was bright, forced. “Eira’s coming by soon remember? Malek’s daughter? She wanted to show you around.”
Amari sighed loudly. Right, the tour. The witch’s daughter playing welcome wagon for the dying girl. “Yeah, I’ll be ready.”
By the time she made it downstairs, showered and dressed in jeans and an oversized t-shirt that hid the mark, a girl was perched on the bottom step like she’d been carved there. She had her father’s sharp cheekbones and dark eyes, but where Malek moved with careful deliberation, his daughter vibrated with energy. She looked up from her phone and grinned. 
“You must be Amari Brown.” She extended her hand for a handshake. “Dad said you’ve been hiding upstairs for two days straight. Figured someone should drag you into sunlight before you turn into a vampire yourself.” 
Amari shook her hand, managing a smile. “I wasn’t hiding, Just tired.”
“Uh-huh. Come I’ll show you the parts of Delmoor that won’t kill you.” Eira stood and headed for the door. 
They stepped outside into the cool air. Delmoor sprawled before them. All narrow streets and old houses with peaked roofs, nothing like Mountain Hill’s suburbs. People walked past, some human, some definitely not, going about their morning like this town wasn’t the strangest place Amari had ever seen. She missed her brother; Riley would’ve loved this. He’d been taking notes, asking million questions, probably trying to befriend the first supernatural creature he met. Instead, he was back home finishing midterms while she was here chasing a maybe, a possibly, a witch who might buy her a few more years. If she was lucky. 
“So,” Eira glanced at her sideways as they walked. “You’ve been here two days and im guessing you’ve seen the inside of one bedroom and maybe the bathroom. That about right? 
“The kitchen too. Once.” 
“Living dangerously.” Eira chuckled. She looked as if she were trying to start a conversation with her but unable to reach through. “You always this much of a hermit or is Delmoor freaking you out?” 
Amari shrugged, it was a bit of both, but she wasn’t about to dump her anxiety on a girl she’d known for five minutes. “Just adjusting.” 
“Yeah well, adjust faster. If you stay cooped up much longer people are gonna think you’re scared of us.”
“Maybe I am.”
Eira laughed. “Smart girl.”
They turned down a wider street where shops clustered together, morning sun breaking through the fog. Amari caught scents she shouldn’t be able to identify, sulfer, ozone, something sweet and wrong that made her nose itch. The mark on her back pulsed once, warm, like it was paying attention. She ignored it. 
“There.” Eira pointed to a building trailing with ivy, warm light spilling from its windows. “The Grill. It’s where everyone hangs out. You want coffee? Food? Dad gave me money and im pretty sure it was guilt money, so we should spend it.”
“Guilt money?”
“For making you move here for the ritual. ”Eira’s tone went carefully casual. “He feels bad about that.”
Amari’s chest tightened. “He shouldn’t. It’s not his fault; I really am grateful to him.”
“Tell him that. He’s been obsessing over your case for months; said he owed you mother a favour.” Eira pushed open the door.  “Come on.”
The Grill was packed, students hunched over laptops, older folks nursing coffee, a group in the corner that had to be vampires based on how still they sat. The air smelled like espresso and something else, something Amari couldn’t name but felt in her teeth. 
Magic. The place hummed with it. 
They’d barely stepped inside when someone walked straight into Amari. 
“Shit, sorry-“ 
Hands caught and steadied her, warm and solid against her arms. Amari found herself looking up into a face that made her breath catch for some reasons she couldn’t immediately name. The man, he was tall, dark haired, dressed in black with eyes the colour of embers in a dying fire. For a split second, his gaze locked on hers and the mark on her shoulder blade flared suddenly, a pulse of heat so intense she gasped. 
The man’s jaw tightened, and he stepped aside, hands dropping. “My fault, I wasn’t watching.” His voice was low and deliberate. 
Then he was gone. Amari stood there, heart pounding, shoulder blade burning. 
Eira exhaled beside her. “Well, that was fun.”
“Who-“
“Kael Varin. ”Eira pulled Amari toward a table in the back, near the window. “And before you ask, yes, he’s a vampire. Trueblood, old family, old blood, dangerous.”
Amari sank into her chair. The mark still throbbed, a slow pulse that wouldn’t quit. “He looked… normal.”
“That’s the problem.” Eira flagged down a server. “Kael’s the nice one. It’s his brother you’ve got to worry about?”
“His brother?”
“Ilay Varin. He runs the southern quarter and by ‘runs’ I means controls with an iron fist. People go missing around him. Lots of people.” Eira’s voice dropped. “Dad says Ilay’s the reason most of the other Trueblood left town. But Kael stayed. Even though everyone knows Illay’s a monster, he’s loyal to the guy. Or he’s just stupid.”
Amari rubbed her arms trying to shake the lingering warmth of Kael’s hands. “Does Kael know about that…..”
“About supernatural stuff? ” Eira snorted. “He is supernatural stuff. But if you are asking if he knows about you specifically, probably not. Unless…” She tilted her head. “Did something happen just now? You look weird.”
“No,” Amari lied. “Just surprised. I’ve never met a Trueblood before.”
“Well, now you have. Try not to make a habit of it.”
They ordered coffee and pastries. Amari picked at hers, appetite gone. Across the room, she caught glimpses of Kael through the crowd, leaning against the far wall, talking to someone she couldn’t see. He hadn’t looked back at her once. So why did her shoulder blade still feel like it was on fire? 
“Do you ever get used to it?” Amari asked quietly. 
“Used to what?”
“The feeling that everything here is watching you?”
Eira was quiet for a moment, stirring coffee. “I am surprised you noticed, most humans, even the ones who were born here never notice. Delmoor’s different from other towns. It feels alive, like the streets have a pulse. You’ll get used to it eventually. Or you won’t and you’ll leave.” She looked up, meeting Amari’s eyes. ” Most people leave.”
“What about you? Are you going to leave?”
“Dad wants me to go to college. Normal life, normal education.” Eira’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. “I’m still deciding.”
“But you’re not like him, right? Not a witch?”
“Nope. Just a regular human. Got my mom’s genes, I guess.” Eira looked away. “She died when I was little. Cancer.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Thanks.” Eira drained her coffee. “Anyway. Tell me about you. Aunt Suzan said you’re in university?”
Amari welcomed the subject change. “Mh, nursing, this is my final year.” 
“Heavy. All that blood and people dying on you.” 
Amari shot her a look, but Eira’s expression was genuinely curious, not mocking. “Someone has to do it.” 
“I guess.” Eira leaned back. “Does my dad, has he told you anything about the ritual? What to expect?” 
There it was. The question Amari had been avoiding since she arrived. 
“He said it’ll buy me time. “She kept her voice level. “Not a cure… Just … time.” 
 “How much time do you have? Total?” 
Most people didn’t ask directly. Most people danced around it with soft voices and careful words. But Eira asked it like she was asking about the weather which Amari found it almost refreshing.  
“Twenty-five years from when the parasite attached. We found the mark three years ago, when I was seventeen, but we think it had been there for at least six months before that.” Amari did the math she’d done a thousand times, the numbers burned into her brain like a brand. “I turn twenty-one next month. Best case scenario, I make it to twenty-five. Worst case….” She trailed off 
“So you have maybe four years left.” Eira said quietly. “Five if you’re lucky.”
“Four years and one month.” Amari corrected then immediately wished she hadn’t. It sounded worse when she said it out loud, more real. “Give or take.” 
Eira drummed her fingers on the table. “My dad is one of the strongest witches in Delmoor. Big family history and lots of knowledge. He’s seen a lot of people die.” Her voice went soft. “Too many, probably, I think that’s why he can’t let your case go. He keeps thinking there must be something everyone else missed.”
Amari’s chest tightened. She’d spent three years hoping for that, for someone to find the thing everyone else had overlooked, the loophole in her death sentence. She wanted to live.  But the hope was exhausting, and she’d learned to live without it. 
“You’re, okay?” Eira noticed the drop in her expression. 
“Fine, just tired.”
“You keep saying that.”
“Because it keeps being true.” 
Eira studied her for a moment, then stood. “Come on. Let’s get you back before Aunt Suzan sends a search party. It’s getting late anyway.” 
Amari glanced at the window. The sun had shifted lower, fog creeping back through the streets. Had they really been here that long? They left The Grill, stepping into cool afternoon air. The streets had emptied, most people retreating indoors as shadows lengthened. 
“Shortcut’s through here,” Eira said, nodding toward a narrow street veiled in dim light. “It is faster than the main road.” 
Amari followed her, the stones slick under her feet. Halfway through the lane, the air changed, quieter, heavier. Then a voice cut through the silence. 
“Evening.” 
Amari froze. Kael stood a few paces ahead, one shoulder against the stone wall, the light catching in his dark hair. He looked perfectly at ease, like he’d been waiting for them.  
Eira stopped beside Amari, expression guarded. “Kael.” 
“Eira,” He inclined his head politely. “Didn’t expect to see you out this way.”
“Just taking Amari home,” her voice had gone carefully neutral. “I was showing her around.”
Kael’s gaze moved to Amari and for an instant, something unreadable crossed his face, curiosity? Recognition? It was gone before she could name it. 
“You are new,” he said, not a question. 
Amari’s voice came out steadier than she felt. “So I’ve been told.”
His eyes lingered on her and the mark on her back answered with a slow burn that crawled up her spine. She couldn’t hide the wince this time.  
Kael’s brow furrowed. “You’re hurt.”
“I’m fine,” The lie came quickly. “Just tired.”
“Delmoor does that,” he said quietly. “It doesn’t take kindly to outsiders.” 
“Maybe I’ll earn its kindness.”
“Or its attention,” he murmured, almost to himself. 
Eira cleared her throat, stepping slightly forward. “We should go, Aunt Suzan’s waiting.” 
Kael’s lips curved, something between a smile and a warning. “Then you shouldn’t keep her waiting.”
He moved aside, and they passed him. Cedar and smoke clung to him, sharp and wrong, and for a moment the fog seemed to bend toward his shadow. When Amari looked back, he was gone. 
They walked in silence until they reached the crossroads where the streetlights burned brighter, cutting through the mist. 
“Uhm,” She said coming to a stop. She pulled a sheet of paper from her pocket. “Do you maybe recognize this writing? I figured I should ask since your father is a witch.” 
Eira reached for the paper. “ Where did you get this? I can’t quite figure out the words but it is similar to my father’s spell.” 
“They were on my bed when I woke up.” 
“I’ll ask father for help when I get home.” Amari’s eyes flickered under the bright light to look at her. “I won’t tell him it’s yours if you don’t want to.” 
Amari sighed as she glanced over her shoulder one more time expecting to see nothing. A figure stood at the mouth of the alley. Kael, half turned toward her, not moving, not speaking. His eyes caught the streetlight, bright as embers. 
Then the fog swallowed him. 
Amari’s hands trembled. The mark on her back throbbed once, then settled, warm and quiet like a promise she didn’t understand.  
“Eira,” she whispered. “How do you know when a place has claimed you?”
Eira hesitated, her face shadowed by the streetlight’s edge. “When leaving stops feeling like an option.”
Amari didn’t answer. Somewhere deep in her chest, she suspected Delmoor had already decided.",2,1762355353.0,Romantasy,0,1.0,False

Naturally, it's more complicated than a single issue, but I've never heard anyone talk about this and I wonder what others think.

Before the 90's, smoking was everywhere. It's been stated elsewhere that nicotine can help manage ADHD symptoms. 

I wonder if there's a link between the way society largely stopped smoking and the rise of ADHD in adults.

It would also work with the idea that ADHD was something that kids grew out of. As kids grew up and started smoking and drinking coffee, a lot of symptoms would probably have improved.

It'd be interesting to see an actual study on this, I think.",0,1762355318.0,ADHD,4,0.5,False

Then I found the Super brand Rich, which was ok. But it has too become kind of sweet. I guess sugar is cheaper than coffee powder and someone wanted to earn more per packet.

I have also tried the Super brand version that says ""less sweet"", but I find it to be very similar in taste... still equally sweet somehow, just less powder per packet. 

I have tried a few others too that claim to be rich and strong and less sweet, but none of them tastes any stronger to me. Some of the less sweet seem to compensate with more milk powder instead of more coffee.

So, have you found any that are actually stronger (more coffee)? I still want a bit of sugar and creamer/milk powder, but mostly coffee powder.

1op58fm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1op58fm/what_a_day_looked_like_inside_a_cfd_broker_before/,"What a Day Looked Like Inside a CFD Broker, Before I Realized the Truth","When I joined the CFD broker, I thought I was stepping into the real world of finance. The office had that clean, corporate energy, glowing monitors, fast-talking dealers, and the constant rhythm of live markets. I was the Senior Business Development Executive, responsible for key clients, account performance, and communication between the sales team and the dealing desk. On paper, it was a prestigious role. In reality, it was an education I wasn’t prepared for.

Every morning started the same. Coffee in hand, I’d walk over to the dealing desk before the London session opened. The team would already be watching dozens of accounts across multiple screens. They weren’t watching the market, they were watching people.  
This guy’s going to blow up, one dealer would say, zooming in on a client over-leveraged on gold.  
Another would laugh, He’s adding margin every four hours. Revenge trader.  
There was always laughter, not out of cruelty, but detachment. After a while, the numbers stopped representing human beings. They became just metrics, risk percentages, exposure levels, probability curves.

I used to think traders were competing against the market. Inside the broker, I realized they were being watched, measured, and categorized, not as clients, but as risk profiles.

As Senior Business Development, I had one foot in both worlds, the client’s and the broker’s. I spoke with traders every day: dreamers, hustlers, people chasing freedom, others trying to recover losses. Many believed they were one trade away from changing their lives.

During day when someone performed too well, my inbox would light up with a message from Risk:  
Check this client, algo?  
This guy is having perfect entries, look up for his name on socials!  
Account ""452432"" is beating the spreads  


I’d pull up the account, see perfect entries, tight stops, identical lot sizes, consistency that looked machine-like. Then I’d send the classic, sterile email:  
  
Dear Client, we’ve noticed automated trading patterns on your account.  
Dear Client, please upload a document to verify your source of funds. ""This way we're preparing him to cancel his profit and refund his initial balance""  
Any excuse we could pull to put him out of our system.  
  
That was our polite way of saying you’re too good to be B-booked.

What the client never knew was how easy it was to switch them. One click in the back-office system, and their trades were now being routed out to the liquidity provider instead of staying in-house. We called it risk management. In truth, it was survival. The logic was simple: if you’re losing, we’ll keep you inside. If you’re winning, we’ll pass you out. Because the house only wants predictable losses.

By noon, the chat between departments was full of screenshots and sarcastic comments. Another one margin-called. Look at this guy averaging down on GBP/USD again. His SL on XAUUSD is about to get hit and we are going to watch it together and enjoy it.

On the sales side, the atmosphere was different but connected. When a client deposited a great amount, we reach out to him instantly to offer some fake advices and enforce the relation with him... A big deposit meant meant a great win for us. It sounds dark, but after a while, it became normal.

When a client requested a withdrawal, the account manager would immediately reach out. The message was always the same: stay a little longer, the trading team is expecting a major market movement, and this is confidential, don’t tell anyone I told you. The idea was to make them feel privileged, like they were getting inside information. Sometimes, it worked. Many canceled their withdrawals and even added more funds.

I’ve seen account managers go even further, offering clients personal signal services on the side and make them lose in order to increase their commissions. It was crazy. They’d promise them entry points, trends, insider hints, anything to keep them trading.

I do remember reaching out to a client who had just deposited 350k$. He was optimistic, sharp, and genuinely trying to approach trading with discipline yet he sounded like someone who's going to blow his account. I offered to help him structure his trading, to manage his account properly, guarantee that he’d be A-booked, follow a strict risk plan, and use a tight stop-out level with a fair profit split. Management found out and pulled me aside. They told me that doing so went against our interests, that the company could be making 350k$, and I’d get my commission anyway. You’d say I was greedy, maybe naive, but a few weeks later he lost one 132k$ and requested a withdrawal. 

The truly confidential part of the job wasn’t software or hidden tools. It was the data. The broker knew retail psychology better than anyone. We could predict when traders would overtrade, when they’d add funds, and when they’d give up.

Data showed that most clients opened positions during volatility spikes, exactly when spreads widened. So marketing timed campaigns around that behavior. When markets were quiet, we sent emails saying Top 3 assets to trade this week. When volatility rose, we sent Don’t miss the next big move. Every message was engineered to do one thing: keep people trading.

One Friday evening, I remember a client who had turned $8,000 into almost $50,000 in under two weeks. Clean entries, tight stops, no gambling. A rare disciplined trader. Risk didn’t like it.  
Switch him, the dealer said.  
Full A-book? I asked.  
Yeah. We can’t keep taking that hit internally.  
How about if we flag his account for suspicious trading activity?  
No, that's too obvious, based on the way he trades, he knows more than enough, he might file a complaint.

And that was it. One click. The next morning, that trader woke up believing everything was the same, unaware his trades were now being mirrored to the external market. He probably thought he’d leveled up. In truth, he’d just stopped being profitable for us.

Over time, I started noticing things I couldn’t unsee. The educational emails came from marketing, not analysts. The webinars on risk management were scripts for sales funnels. Discussions about client retention sounded more like casino strategy meetings than anything in finance.

It wasn’t that anyone was evil. Most people in that office were just following incentives. They believed in the idea of helping people trade. But the system itself was built on an unspoken truth: it only works if most clients lose. And they do, predictably, statistically, mechanically.

By evening, the office would quiet down. Screens flickered in the dark, floating P/L numbers glowing red and green. Somewhere out there, traders were staring at the same numbers, believing they were fighting the market. But often, they weren’t fighting the market at all. They were playing a game where the rules had already been writen against them.

This post isn’t meant to make you hate brokers. There are still A-book brokers out there, doing things the right way, even if they’re making 100 times less than a typical B-book operation. Those brokers actually need their traders to succeed, because their profits come from commissions and spreads, not from watching clients lose",19,1762355016.0,Daytrading,6,0.89,False

I had the Razor set on 3 for the entire shave.  got some mild feedback with the alum bock, not too bad, but I got a really close shave. Something I like about A&E in general is how pronounced  the fragrance of their soaps is.

I splashed on Thayer’s, Asian Plum ASL, and finally Zingari Man’s unscented after shave balm. I really like this scent and my wife helped me decide between this and Asian Pair when smelling samples.

Plum, dried fruits, tobacco, tonka bean, coffee, vanilla and a touch of Plumeria.


Good shaves to you!

Traveling with the wife in December staying at trs turquesa and had couple of questions if folks could help?

1) staying 5 days wanted to do one excursion is going to soana island worth it? Should I book through the hotel or independently? Any thing maybe that would be recommended?

2) any good cigar shops near that area? Or coffee shops as well?

3) worth buying an e-sim or just buying a SIM card at the airport?

4) how is the airport in general?  Way back we have a flight late so might need to spend some time there is there good duty free or restaurant?

Thanks in advance for any assistance!",1,1762354954.0,PuntaCana,1,0.67,False

I’m working on a special birthday present for my boss, who’s moving to Columbus soon. The idea: a “Tour of Italy (Olive Garden) experience” in local-gift form, picking up must-try/experience goodies from central Ohio shops and packaging them into a small but memorable welcome bundle (~$200ish budget).

Already locked in:

- Krema Nut Company (because who doesn’t love a classic nut & sweets stop?)

- The Book Loft coffee table book or Columbus themed item

- North Market item or gift card 

Now I’m looking for 2-4 other local “must-shop” spots that capture Columbus, feel fun, fit into the $200 total, and can provide a memorable gift item or two.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! ￼

So… I did a little experiment.  

I tried the **Fit To Be Pregnant Plan** for *30 straight days*, and let me just say — coffee who? My energy tripled, my brain fog lifted, and I stopped feeling like a walking nap request.  

I didn’t think a simple guided plan could have that much impact on how energized and *supported* I felt during pregnancy — but the results? Shocking (in a good way).  

Here’s what stood out:  

✅ **Consistency > Complexity**  
Instead of overwhelming routines or impossible nutrition rules, everything was doable. It’s like the plan *met me where I was*, not where an influencer’s imaginary morning routine exists.  

✅ **Nutrition That Actually Makes Sense**  
The plan breaks down food choices scientifically *and* practically. I finally understand what my body genuinely needs daily — not what some blog says will “magically boost energy.”  

✅ **Built-In Encouragement**  
Think accountability, but gentle. You’re reminded to listen to your body, not push past it. It’s a fundamentally different mindset — healing, not hustling.  

✅ **Results That Snuck Up On Me**  
About two weeks in, I noticed less fatigue, more mental clarity, and one day realized — “Wait, I haven’t had that afternoon crash in days.” That, for a pregnant human, felt like a superpower.  

Here’s the link if you’re curious to check it out for yourself 👉 [Fit To Be Pregnant Plan – find it here!](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b)  

And yes… I’m convinced more people need this. Especially if:  

- You’re tired of guessing what your body actually needs.  
- You’ve tried every “bounce-back” or energy-boost trend.  
- You just want steady strength and peace of mind.

Partially to get something I didn’t have to make myself, and also just to get out for a few minutes and interact with someone.

This morning there was a woman already waiting on her order when I walked in. Now to say was beautiful is almost an disservice to her, by every definition and opinion of the word, none would argue if it applied to her or not. At 6 feet tall myself, I found I still had to look up to make proper eye contact. I doubt there's a room she's been in that was not aware of her.

I'm naturally very friendly and have been told I give off that “vibe”, we made eye contact so I gave a small smile and a nod and she smiled back. She had to clarify her order preference and then made a joke about ""being that person now"", I followed up with another joke and we got to talking. I try to talk to anyone I can while I'm out, usually pretty lighthearted or even flirty without intent, but today I felt actual interest from her. Once she received her order, we exchanged names, a “finger shake” as her hands were full, and said our goodbyes, she hesitated a moment and then walked out slowly. My order was right after hers and as I was about to leave I realized if I was quick I could catch up to her, but I stopped myself.

She looked to be in the latter half of her 20's, enforced by the chat and giving the sense she’s early in her career. She made a joke about her future kids, which I took as a quiet way of saying she didn’t have any yet. I realized our lives are at different points.

I’m around 40, though anyone would guess younger. I’m a divorced father with a daughter who lives with me full time, her mom helps a little, but with no family and few friends my support network is nonexistent. Most of my time and energy go into trying to be a good parent and just making it through the day. After my divorce, I had briefly attempted to date but found that to be more difficult than I had expected. I read some personal experiences with dating from fathers who co-parent and a common problem reported was jealousy from their new partners towards the ex. I waved it away as unreliable narrators trying to explain away their failed relationships with a bit of sexism but in the end it’s exactly what happened for me.

Since then, I’ve avoided dating anyone without kids and, honestly, avoided dating altogether. With being busy, a lack of mental energy, and having to be hyper aware of depression trying to sneak its way back into my life, I know I wouldn’t be able to put in the work to be a good partner right now. Especially someone 15 years younger with all the energy and time in the world.

I’ve been single for years now, I’m not bad-looking and don’t have trouble meeting people, but I’ve stayed off dating apps and such by choice. Still, today was the first time in a long while I felt genuine interest from someone in an everyday setting, and it just happened to be someone who checked every superficial wish list item before you decide to try and get to know them better. Having this interaction, fighting internally, then ultimately walking straight to my car afterward just felt unexpectedly awful.",1,1762354908.0,Vent,8,0.56,False

So do I recommend the game? If I wanted to ruin your life I would say yes, but the 12 step of addiction I must say no, I do not recommend the game. Here is why.  

  
You will lose your job (because as I write this, I haven't slept and decided to take a break with a morning coffee, twice in a row I have missed work now, and they keep calling. I have not answered yet! I should of written them a formal notice, that I was out performing some court duties. 

Your family and friends will try to help at first but then, will leave you because of your addiction, my wife is mad at me and took the kids with her, and left the house.  

The product of EU5 is highly addictive right from the start, I mean the moment you click play, you enter this new world in less than 1 minute! I'm surprised!!!! (of course maybe if your file save becomes heavy mid to late game this might change, but so far with my PC the game loads fast, and the best no freaking launcher !!!!!)

  
On my 10 hour so far, I crashed once, but I might of been the instigator as I was running other stuff in the background. Noob mistake, close all application that you aren't using, to make sure you dedicate the entire CPU to the product, you don't want to mix the purity of EU5 with lesser additive. I love how the game takes the best feature of other paradox games and put it in EU5, and I love the hints, greats for new people who like a general direction of what to do or how to solves an issue. There is a lot of depth, I started as Holland because the mighty Dutch empire must be the best rag to riches story, you start small but can become a mighty powerhouse and also because TUTU TUU TUUUU (if you know my reference F1). 

  
Does the game has issues here and there? Yea but if has not prevented me from playing the game or enjoying or getting addicted. Do I wish the UI might be better for towns? YES, but and this is a big but, if you want to know what to build or the type of building available, click on the pop when in the town menu and it will give you the building that employ that pop, so if you have available pop to work, make those building, a pop that doesn't work, doesn't pay taxes, and I need taxes to pay for my addiction.

  
Anyways I wanna thank the devs for the amazing game, I was going through a rough patch as we speak, and this game is my salvation. (this is real), 

Of course my review is a bit dramatized, no I'm not losing my job or missing work, no my wife isn't leaving me. If you have a mid decent gaming PC I strongly suggest buying the game, if you have a potato or laptop that is 5 years old yea don't and save up to get a better PC or play it with Geforce Now.

1op52us,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreame_Tech/comments/1op52us/navigation_with_lidar_down/,Navigation with LIDAR down,"Hi, I have an Aqua 10 Roller and in general I am quite happy with it. I can live with some of its quirks but the one that drives me crazy is how poorly it cleans my Living Room.

My Living Room consists of several low areas. One of which is a couch which is in a corner,  diagonal to the room. I also have a coffee table which it can easily get under and another couch- these are both square to the room.

I find that it does a reasonable job of the first part of the clean with the LIDAR up, but then it lowers it to clean under the furniture.

If it starts with the square-on second sofa it will do a reasonable job for it, but for the the coffee table and diagonal sofa it is terrible.

I could cope with just the cleaning not being good, but what happens is that it gets totally lost thinking it is still under the furniture when it's actually in the middle of the room. It spends forever not being able to find its way out again (virtually) because it bumps into walls etc. that it doesn't think should be there. Nearly every time I have to end the clean and move it to make it reposition itself.

Below is a map of my living room. I have tried various configurations for adding the low lying blue boxes to cover the diagonal couch, including ones that don't overlap and follow the boards of the room.

Also notice that the diagonal sofa and coffee table are on carpet (I wonder if it struggles more to guess its position when moving on carpet).

Part of the problem is caused by it frequently not bothering to lift its turret between furniture which would correct its position.

I have tried remapping twice. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to help it navigate with the LIDAR down?

At this point I am considering a Saros 10R as its LIDAR isn't in a turret that lowers.

The first few days were rough, I kept catching myself unlocking my phone without even thinking. My thumb literally went to where Instagram used to be. 

After like day 4 something started to change. my brain wasn’t buzzing anymore. I actually sat through a full meal without checking anything. I started reading again, cleaned my room properly, even had longer talks with my family. My focus came back in ways I forgot were possible.

The funny thing is, I didn’t even realize how much I was drowning in noise until it got quiet. Those small moments morning coffee, a walk outside they started feeling different like I was finally there. I could actually think. And the cool part about Sheksiz is that other people were doing their own detox challenges too. Seeing that made it easier to stay in.

The interface is still evolving, and setting up demo data for every capture is a bit too much work right now.*)

**The Story Behind Journiv**

I got into self-hosting last year and like many here, this sub has been an incredible resource.

While exploring options journaling solution, I realized there wasn’t a truly modern, self-hosted equivalent to Day One or Apple Journal. Most alternatives were either general note apps or old abandoned projects.

I wanted something focused on journaling with:

* “On This Day” memories
* Prompt-based journaling
* A clean, minimal, distraction-free writing experience

So… I built my own: [Journiv](https://journiv.com/), a beautiful (at least I am trying to make it so), self-hosted, privacy-first journaling app with mood tracking, daily prompts, and meaningful insights.

**Tech Stack**

* **Backend:** Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL (Dockerized)
* **Frontend:** Flutter (web + mobile)

**Features**

* Clean, minimal writing interface
* ""On This Day” view
* Prompt-based journaling
* Mood tracking
* Multiple journals and tags
* Full-text search
* Insights & analytics
* Light / Dark mode
* Media gallery with full-quality uploads
* Export PDF & share entries (mobile)

For setup instructions check the [README](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app/blob/main/README.md) on GitHub.

**Coming Soon**

* Native iOS and Android apps (since the frontend is flutter it is ready but I need to figure out process and legalities of launching an app on App Store and Play Store)
* More refined UI / UX (as I level up in Flutter)
* Day One Import
* Quick audio notes (with transcription)
* Apple Journaling Suggestions integration
* Weather & health metadata
* Location tagging (map view)
* Immich integration
* Strava integration
* …and your next feature request!

I had 4 children before we got together and we are about to have our second together, as I am 31 weeks pregnant. We are both slightly above average in looks and both have our own struggles with mental health and past relationship issues. We got together not initially out of love, but more of convenience, loneliness, desperation. I loved his personality from the beginning and knew I could live with him forever, but the feelings weren’t there initially. We slowly began to trust each other and I grew very fond of him. When we had our first baby I fell so hard, emotionally, in love with him. He really stepped up as a dad and a husband and I think that was my biggest fear with letting someone into my heart.
I work full-time, enrolled in online college full-time, and I’m taking additional certification classes. All so I can get a higher paying job to support our large family. With that be said, I don’t make nearly as much as my husband does. I also care for the kids in the afternoon when I get off work, picking them up from school, taking them to the park, going to the gym, and occasionally taking them to their Dr.appts and I make dinner 5 to 6 days a week. My husband also works full-time but goes into work in the late morning so he cares for the kids till then. Making sure they are fed, taking them to school, taking them to Dr. Appts, occasionally meeting with the schools concerning the kids, and caring for our toddler. Our bedroom life is at night and before this issue, intimacy was 1-2 times a week. With me being overly pregnant it hasn’t been the most fun experience for either of us though. And I had felt that maybe I was living in a fantasy world and that this marriage isn’t as perfect as I thought. I even brought it up to him a couple months ago, in which he reassured me that my feelings were reciprocated. But I had also noticed he had been making way more sexual comments about other women than usual.
3 weeks ago we were laying in bed watching an anime and I playfully grabbed his phone in front of him as he got out of the bed, pretending like I was going to go through it and quickly scrolled through his messages, knowing me likes to delete everything to help with phone storage. But he missed a message. A random average looking stranger was texting him and sent a selfie, because of her looks and the selfie, I knew it wasn’t spam. He replied with “you look cute” and sent a selfie back. My whole world shattered. He quickly snatched his phone back and deleted everything in a panic and said “it’s spam! I blocked her! You don’t have to worry about it!” I walked out of the room, grabbed my car keys and took the kids to the park, where I then cried my eyes out in the car and called his mom. I knew this wasn’t an isolated incident. But I hadn’t gone through his phone extensively in 6 years, so I had no idea how bad it could be. I wanted a witness that wouldn’t hate my husband and I could confide in, so I turned to my MIL. He texted me while I was gone to say “I know it was stupid, but I promise I didn’t cheat.” After about an hour I returned home. Had a short conversation with him where he promised it won’t happen again and that it was the only time it happened and I left it at that. This happened on a Saturday afternoon.
That whole rest of the weekend I was having chronic BM from stress, super high anxiety, and everything was slowly sinking in. By Wednesday night the stress had caused my uterus to have frequent and slightly too strong of contractions for it to be Braxton hicks. The contractions woke me out of my sleep and I drove myself to the hospital. They confirmed the contractions however they were irregular and I was showing no signs of dehydration or infection and my cervix was not responding, so I was sent home. Friday night I was awoken in the middle of my sleep from anxiety and decided I was going to extensively go through his phone. Over the course of two nights I memorized all of his passwords and their variations which I had never known or cared to know before this. I found all of his past history and signed into every dating account and hook-up account I could think of, even if they weren’t in his history or saved passwords. I FOUND SO MUCH. 
Firstly, that he had been trying to cheat, unsuccessfully from what I saw, since 2 years into our relationship. And that it had he had been doing this off and on for 4 years.
Secondly, that while I was going on vacation to see my mom for a weekend while he had to work, he had posted an ad for someone to come over, that he could “host.” Then, he reposted it on Thursday after I had been in the hospital.
Third, he was searching ways to find and pay for intimacy, recently. From what I saw, he was unsuccessful in following through.
Fourth, he was playing a bunch of very NSFW games involving anime characters.
All of this behavior put together made me realize that there was something wrong. I thought it was my fault for not trying hard enough in the bedroom. But he clearly was feeling insecure about himself.
I talked to him about his feelings on Saturday where he stated that our bedroom life was boring since I can barely do anything and it’s always the same. I intiate foreplay with my mouth and climb on top. I told him I would work on it. He also told me he deactivated all of his accounts and deleted his passwords. So I decided I would put him to the test. I created an account on one of the sites, found that he did not in fact deactivate or delete his account, found his “ad” and replied to it pretending to be a stranger. He promptly replied. By late morning I guess his conscious had slightly gotten to him and he said “I’m sorry but I am on the verge of ruining my marriage…” I responded with “it’s alright, I understand.” An hour goes by and he says that he needs a gym partner and invites me to go to the gym with him… on a hook-up site. When I said “I don’t go to the gym” he then deleted the profile and posts. I didn’t reveal myself and by Sunday night after I had gathered more information from his phone, proving he did not delete half of the accounts, I prepared to file for divorce. I had everything ready by the morning, but I thought I needed to at least talk to him. I sent him a message when I woke up and he wasn’t in the room. “I think we need to get a divorce” he asked if we could talk. Not wanting to involve the kids in our drama, I suggested to go get coffee and talk. 
With logic, I ripped him a new asshole.

1. What were you expecting, a random girl to come over, give you the time of yourlife, and everything be fine and dandy?

2. Do you understand how unsafe it is for you to be with strangers and have them in our house? Considering, scams, diseases, and the kids safety?

3. How could you think of doing this to your overly pregnant wife?

4. If I can’t make you happy, then do you expect that some stranger can? Cause I pour every ounce of myself into this relationship, emotionally, physically, and financially.

5. If you feel this insecure then no one is going to be able to fix you, you have to work on yourself.

6. I don’t want you to be stuck in a marriage that doesn’t make you happy and I don’t want to live in a marriage that hurts. 

7. If the tables were turned, how do you think you would feel if I was actively trying to cheat on you because I was “bored?” You would have left me in the dust.

8. I am fully prepared for divorce. I’ve done it before, and I have no problem starting over again. You say you don’t want that, but I suggest you show it otherwise I will not hesitate to leave. 

9. I am willing to work through this if it is truly what you want, but I need the same from you.

10. You need to be absolutely completely honest with me. You are my best friend and we can work through anything as long as I know what is going on. You need to come clean about everything on Monday night. If you ever feel the urge to do something like this again, you need to talk to me.

With that being the conclusion to our fight, we continued to talk about our feelings over the past 3 weeks. We used a messaging app as a safe place for us to talk to each other without any judgement, using aliases. Where we could say inappropriate things to each other, express our deepest feelings, or share secrets.
Later that week after the fight, I asked him if he wanted to open the relationship. His answer was quickly “no” but I knew why… he’s heard the horror stories from Reddit about open relationships going entirely wrong. 
A few days later I asked him again but said we can come up with any rules we want to. We are life partners and I just want him to be happy as much as I want to be happy. He agreed. Hopefully I will have an update for how it goes. Maybe it’ll work out, maybe it won’t. But we made rules that will protect both of us and our children, and hopefully keep our relationship strong. What would you guys have done? Maybe, I’m obsessing too much over this and should have just left. But I can’t help but empathize with him and care about how he feels even if he didn’t care about me. I know what it’s like to feel unwanted by people, which was his main reason for this, but all I needed was him. So maybe I’m not enough for him, and maybe that’s ok, as long as we have rules and we both follow them. I hope for both our sakes he doesn’t screw this up. I wish he was a horrible husband and I had saw this coming so I knew what to do. ",0,1762354459.0,relationship_advice,17,0.33,False
1op4zgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1op4zgs/betterme_20hour_fasting_diet/,BetterMe: 20-Hour Fasting Diet,"The 20-hour fasting diet (often called **20:4** or the **“Warrior Diet”**) limits eating to a **4-hour window** and fasting for the remaining **20 hours**. Some versions allow small amounts of raw fruits/veggies during the fast, but the main calories are eaten in the 4-hour window.

This approach falls under **intermittent fasting**, which can support weight loss for some people by naturally reducing calorie intake. However, research specifically on the 20:4 pattern is limited, and it’s considered one of the **more extreme fasting schedules**.

**How to Try It More Safely**

* **Talk to a healthcare provider first**, especially if you have medical conditions or take meds.
* **Start with easier fasting** windows (12:12 → 14:10 → 16:8) and only progress if it feels sustainable.
* **Stay hydrated** (water, unsweetened coffee/tea).
* During eating window:
   * Choose **protein + fiber-rich meals** to stay fuller longer.
   * Aim for a **reasonable calorie deficit**, not restriction → binge cycles.
* Include **exercise**, ideally strength training + light/moderate cardio.

❔❔ Do you think strict fasting windows help structure eating — or lead to overeating later?

1op4yba,https://i.redd.it/5u8z5v7ccgzf1.png,"Straight from the ""Online H3rald"" as they asked the one and only: “Sir, is Ethan Klein single-handedly controlling the narrative of the entire internet?”","Donald Jimothy Trump:

""Let me tell you something, folks, this Ethan Klein guy is tremendous. Tremendous. People do not give him enough credit. They say, “Sir, you are not going to believe this, Ethan’s out there, he’s saying things, he’s talking about issues, he’s standing up to these phonies,” and I say, “Good for him.” Good for him. Because most people do not do that anymore. They are afraid. They are owned by somebody. They read from the teleprompter. They play it safe. Not Ethan. Ethan says what he thinks. He’s a real one. I respect that. Believe me.

I’ve seen him. H3 Podcast, huge numbers, incredible show, people love it. I know people who say, “Sir, we do not miss an episode,” and these are strong people, tough people, people who do not waste time. But they watch Ethan because he is authentic. He is not fake. He does not care about what the elites think. He does not bow down to the cancel mobs. And let me tell you, those mobs are vicious. Vicious. They would cancel your grandmother if they could. Ethan just keeps doing his thing. He is not afraid to make people uncomfortable, and that is very rare. That is leadership, folks. You might not think it, but it is.

And while we are talking about it, you look at these other guys trying to copy him, like Hasan Piker. Very sad. Very sad. Hasan thinks he is some kind of hero, sitting around pretending to fight for the people, while he is out there shocking his dog. Terrible. Really terrible. Who does that? Nobody with a heart, folks. Nobody. And he tries to act like he is this big moral guy, but you cannot be moral when you are electrocuting your dog. That is not progressive. That is psychotic. That is crazy. I have seen a lot of low moves in politics and media, but that one? That might be the lowest. Possibly the lowest of all time.

Now, folks, we have to talk about Ian Idubbz. Total character. Total chaos. I mean, you watch this guy, and you think, what is happening? It is like he looked at the instruction manual for the internet and said, “Nope, I do not need that.” Every video is a new adventure in confusion. People send me clips, they say, “Sir, are you seeing this?” and I say, “I am seeing it, it is incredible, unbelievable, absolutely tremendous confusion.” Like a fireworks show where none of the fireworks go off, but the smoke machine keeps running. Spectacularly ridiculous.

And let me tell you, it is much harder to deport somebody who already fled to Canada. Very hard, folks. Believe me. I have the best people, the best eyes, the best coffee, and we are still scratching our heads. Very complicated. Total mess. Nobody knows what to do. Incredible challenge. But that is why we are going to do the presidential quality control review, folks. Because somebody has to do it. Only me. Only Trump.

We are going to sit down, big screen, best snacks, maybe some Diet Coke, and we are going to watch every clip. Every clip. We are going to ask the tough questions: Why is this guy even doing that? What is going through his mind? Tremendous investigation. The kind of investigation nobody else is brave enough to do. We are going to file a report, the best report, called “Why Is This Guy Doing That.” People will talk about it for weeks, maybe months. Tremendous. Historic. Legendary.

And then there is Nancy SoulCycle. You know her, folks. The mysterious spinning lady who keeps showing up like a ghost in a very sporty cape. She pops up on H3, pedaling like she is training for the next Olympics, then poof, disappears. Is she real? Is she a phantom? Is she a secret agent from another time? Nobody knows. Incredible mystery. I say bring her back, live on the show, full spin class showdown. H3 versus Nancy SoulCycle, the ultimate cardio battle. Ratings through the roof. People love it. Beautiful television. Tremendous. Everyone will be talking about it. Everybody.

Meanwhile, Ethan’s out there with the biggest vape you have ever seen. I mean, folks, this thing is unbelievable. It is a monster. The greatest vape. The biggest clouds. VapeNation. The greatest nation. People say, “Sir, have you seen Ethan’s vape?” and I say, “Of course I have. It is incredible. Nobody vapes like Ethan.” The style, the power, the confidence. VapeNation forever. Absolutely forever. Tremendous clouds. You cannot believe it until you see it.

Ethan used to make funny videos, the best, really great stuff, and now he is running one of the biggest talk shows on YouTube. He took all the hate, all the criticism, and he turned it into success. That is what winners do. Total winner move. He cares about what is happening. He talks about the real issues, not fake talking points like the others. He stands up for creators, for normal people who get crushed by big corporations. I love that. That is what America was built on. Truly built on.

And Hila, by the way, fantastic woman. Strong. Brilliant. Talented. A great partner. Together they built something special. They took so much heat and they are still standing. Most people would have quit, but not them. They just keep going. Ethan understands the internet better than anyone. Maybe even better than me, and I know the internet better than almost anybody. Tremendous. Incredible.

You do not have to agree with him all the time, but you have to respect him. Because he is real. He is telling the truth in a world full of cowards. People say, “Sir, he is controversial.” I say, “Good.” That means he matters. That means he is doing something right. The only people who are not controversial are the ones who do not matter.

So to all the haters, the jealous ones, the phonies, the losers, the weak people, you can say whatever you want. Ethan’s laughing all the way to the top. Vape strapped on. Clouds in the sky. The people’s champion. The greatest vapor, the greatest talker, and honestly, one of the greats of our time. VapeNation, folks. The greatest nation.

1op4y2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1op4y2a/how_to_say_goodbye_to_a_family_relationship/,How to say goodbye to a family relationship?,"I have a pretty complicated relationship with my sister, who isn't a believer.  We got along in our early adulthood, but as she's gotten older, most of our interactions have been pretty stressful/hurtful for me.  I usually have just followed the pattern of our childhood, which was I just got over it without us addressing the issues, and we were back on friendly terms again.   Over the past ten years we haven't had tons of interactions (she lives out of state), but she seems to feel free to tell me that I parent incorrectly (her and her husband don't have children), that my political choices are wrong, and tries to argue with me on other personal choices (like whether or not I get a certain vaccine).  We have very different values, but I don't ever comment on her lifestyle or choices.   It all came to a head about 4 years ago when my dad passed away in a pretty traumatic fashion.  He married someone younger than me, with a criminal background, and he was dead a month later.  Some suspicious things took place right before he passed away, family members told me that he called them and he couldn't get his words out, he was slurring his speech, etc.   The day after he passed away, I went and saw a lawyer to figure out what was going to happen. (Reportedly the wife went through his fire safe box and was seen throwing documents away. . .so no will). When my sister found out that I saw a lawyer she lost it, told me I did a really bad thing.   I was in the depths of grief to really argue with her, I was just deeply hurt.  She basically avoided me for the most part the rest of the time she was here.  This woman who married my dad was horrible, asked (in front of the whole family) if she could put \*\*\*\*sucker on his grave stone, and yet my sister seemed to side with her just to spite me in the whole situation.    A few other hurtful things happened, like our dad's estate took forever to close (partly due to lack of will), but also because the lawyer we hired to help us figure it out was incompetent and wouldn't do his job.  When I tried to communicate with her about all of this, she basically shut it down and told me they weren't changing lawyers and I was basically making it all up (whereas we consulted a few other professionals who told us that the estate was being mismanaged).  If you've read this far, thanks so much.  I haven't seen her in a few years and she wants to meet for coffee today.   I'm struggling with Jesus' command to forgive over and over again, with managing a relationship with someone who I just feel is manipulative, always tries to see the worst in me, and just plain can't stand me.    As per usual, I expect our coffee date to be mostly her telling me more of what I've done wrong over the years and giving me a chance to make it ""right."" ",2,1762354352.0,TrueChristian,1,0.67,False

Today's meditation whispers softly of purpose, of being brought nearer to God, so that through us, His love may find expression in this world.

I once heard the saying, **""A focused fool can accomplish more than a distracted genius.""** It stayed with me. In our fellowship, I've often heard, **""You can be too smart for this program.""** And though that phrase brings a tear to my eye, I've come to see its meaning in a gentler light. It is not that the mind is our enemy, only that the mind, when untamed, forgets its Father. I've also heard the laughter when someone says, **""Welcome to Overthinkers Anonymous.""** And perhaps there's truth in that too.

For the real key is action, humble, steady, faithful action. Divine intelligence works not through our brilliance, but through our willingness. The greatest architect can never raise a house without a single stroke of the hammer. So it is with spiritual progress, one stitch at a time, one act of love, one quiet surrender.

Our Big Book reminds us, **""Upon awakening... ""** How simple, yet how profound. I remember when that instruction seemed nearly impossible. Mornings were a rush of noise, coffee brewing, clock ticking, duties waiting. My mind would race ahead into the day before my knees had even touched the floor. But with patience, and by following the example of another soul who shared their way, I learned to pause. Just for a breath. To offer the day back to the One who gave it.

And that, dear friends, is how the work gets done, not by might, not by intellect, but **by surrender.**

My AA joke today is, *I read that Amazon released its list of the top 100 self-help books, and the researcher remarked that their best customers were alcoholics trying to prove they were not alcoholics.* Oh, look at my book shelf! How many of us tried to fix ourselves before realizing there is a Power greater than self?

Let us go forth today as helpers of His children, instruments of His peace, doing the next right thing in faith and love.

1op4wws,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1op4wws/oh_no_the_coworker_crush/,Oh no: the coworker crush,"Before I jump in, Ive been taught not to “dip the pen in company ink”, and I also acknowledge the thousands of hurdles, and potential judgement that could get thrown at me, so… here it goes: 

I (34M) have developed a serious crush on a coworker (34F) and we’re both in long-term relationships.

Yeah, I know. WTF. 

It started about 15 months ago with a randomized coffee chat. We live in different states and work in different parts of the business. We got along: same humor, interesting conversation, it was super natural. Our chats became regular, and over time, she’s become one of the people I genuinely look forward to talking to most at work.

Additionally throughout the year, we have met a few times at offsites and events: grabbed coffee, had lunch, a cocktail. Nothing inappropriate, just being friends and colleagues. I mean sure, it’s crossed my mind that she’s attractive and I enjoy time with her, but I blew it off given that she mentions her partner a lot and that we’re literally hundreds of miles away. 

Fast forward to today, and rationale has flown out the window. Ironically enough we were both assigned to work the same conference. There are six others here, but we have had the chance to have more time together. We grabbed dinner, a few drinks, setting up for the event. But it’s clear there has been a shift. 

Specifically… body language, and comfortability. She started touching my arm or shoulder when we talked, walking closely (think 1-2 feet apart vs. colleagues). Sure, she’s expressive but it definitely threw me off. Even around the other colleagues she’s been very close, joking and flirtatious. What’s with the shift? 

Something that could definitely explain this shift is that both of us are in relationships that are, frankly, on the rocks. Our partners each want different things out of life, while we both seem to be craving the same things: action, stability, and a sense of direction.

So, am I going nuts or is there something mutual happening here? Is she just feeling more comfortable around me or is this something more? Also, what the hell do I do with all of this? I’m self aware enough to know crushes are fleeting, colleague crushes are asking for it, and I should probably just contact her less. 

What’s odd is that… I can’t shake the magnetic pull. What if like, I miss a shot I don’t take? What if this *is* something real? Do coworker crushes actually ever work out? Can a real-life Serendipity play out as it does in the movie? Lol. 

Even if it didn’t work, would I kick myself if I didn’t try?

Genuinely she is a great friend, intelligent, fun, beautiful. It’d hurt to be rejected or no longer friends. 

I’m very conflicted and no action is the best action. But I’m sure many of you have had that situation where that person gave you the fluttering feeling that makes you think twice. 

If you’re this far, thanks for reading. I don’t really know what advice or judgement I’m going to get, but at least it’s off my chest.

Genre: Romantasy","Heat bloomed beneath the fabric of her pyjamas, sharp and sudden, like spark catching skin. She gasped, her eyes flicking open. The room was dim, filtered in amber light through gauzy curtains and the air smelled faintly of cedar and cold rain. For a moment she forgot where she was, then the unfamiliar creak of the old ceiling reminded her. She had come to Delmoor with her aunt, where her mother used to live. It had been two days, yet the place had begun to feel like it as watching her. 
She lurched out of bed, staggering to her bedroom mirror as she carefully peeled off her pyjama top, wincing and gritting her teeth. As the fabric slid off, she turned, her back to the mirror, her stomach dropped. The mark had grown again. Last week it had been nothing more like a circular sigil on her left shoulder blade, but now, intricate, winding lines that looked almost like roots or veins, branching downwards along her spine.  The lines were darker, more defined, almost like letters, no not letters, symbols. Ancient ones. She traced it with shaking fingers, it was warm, alive. A tear scaped before she could stop it. She blinked it away, swallowing the lump in her throat. 
Three years of this, three years of watching the mark spread, of doctors shaking their hands, witches sighing at their failing spells and of Suzan crying when she thought Amari couldn’t hear. The only response she ever got was that an ancient witch had possessed her body. Four years and one month left, before her body is taken over and she dies.  
She turned back to the room and froze. Sheets of paper lay scattered across her bed like someone had thrown them in a fit. Her handwriting, jagged ink strokes, looping and uneven, covering every sheet. 
“What the hell?” She pulled one closer trying to read the text. The papers quivered slightly as, as much as she had no recollection of writing it, she lacked the ability to make sense of any sentence written. The structure though, resembled that of a witch’s spell, having spent enough time visiting them to recognize the writing. She snatched them up and shoved them into her drawer before her aunt could walk in and found her whispering nonsense to empty air again. 
A knock rattled on the door. “Amari? You awake?” Suzan’s voice was bright, forced. “Eira’s coming by soon remember? Malek’s daughter? She wanted to show you around.”
Amari sighed loudly. Right, the tour. The witch’s daughter playing welcome wagon for the dying girl. “Yeah, I’ll be ready.”
By the time she made it downstairs, showered and dressed in jeans and an oversized t-shirt that hid the mark, a girl was perched on the bottom step like she’d been carved there. She had her father’s sharp cheekbones and dark eyes, but where Malek moved with careful deliberation, his daughter vibrated with energy. She looked up from her phone and grinned. 
“You must be Amari Brown.” She extended her hand for a handshake. “Dad said you’ve been hiding upstairs for two days straight. Figured someone should drag you into sunlight before you turn into a vampire yourself.” 
Amari shook her hand, managing a smile. “I wasn’t hiding, Just tired.”
“Uh-huh. Come I’ll show you the parts of Delmoor that won’t kill you.” Eira stood and headed for the door. 
They stepped outside into the cool air. Delmoor sprawled before them. All narrow streets and old houses with peaked roofs, nothing like Mountain Hill’s suburbs. People walked past, some human, some definitely not, going about their morning like this town wasn’t the strangest place Amari had ever seen. She missed her brother; Riley would’ve loved this. He’d been taking notes, asking million questions, probably trying to befriend the first supernatural creature he met. Instead, he was back home finishing midterms while she was here chasing a maybe, a possibly, a witch who might buy her a few more years. If she was lucky. 
“So,” Eira glanced at her sideways as they walked. “You’ve been here two days and im guessing you’ve seen the inside of one bedroom and maybe the bathroom. That about right? 
“The kitchen too. Once.” 
“Living dangerously.” Eira chuckled. She looked as if she were trying to start a conversation with her but unable to reach through. “You always this much of a hermit or is Delmoor freaking you out?” 
Amari shrugged, it was a bit of both, but she wasn’t about to dump her anxiety on a girl she’d known for five minutes. “Just adjusting.” 
“Yeah well, adjust faster. If you stay cooped up much longer people are gonna think you’re scared of us.”
“Maybe I am.”
Eira laughed. “Smart girl.”
They turned down a wider street where shops clustered together, morning sun breaking through the fog. Amari caught scents she shouldn’t be able to identify, sulfer, ozone, something sweet and wrong that made her nose itch. The mark on her back pulsed once, warm, like it was paying attention. She ignored it. 
“There.” Eira pointed to a building trailing with ivy, warm light spilling from its windows. “The Grill. It’s where everyone hangs out. You want coffee? Food? Dad gave me money and im pretty sure it was guilt money, so we should spend it.”
“Guilt money?”
“For making you move here for the ritual. ”Eira’s tone went carefully casual. “He feels bad about that.”
Amari’s chest tightened. “He shouldn’t. It’s not his fault; I really am grateful to him.”
“Tell him that. He’s been obsessing over your case for months; said he owed you mother a favour.” Eira pushed open the door.  “Come on.”
The Grill was packed, students hunched over laptops, older folks nursing coffee, a group in the corner that had to be vampires based on how still they sat. The air smelled like espresso and something else, something Amari couldn’t name but felt in her teeth. 
Magic. The place hummed with it. 
They’d barely stepped inside when someone walked straight into Amari. 
“Shit, sorry-“ 
Hands caught and steadied her, warm and solid against her arms. Amari found herself looking up into a face that made her breath catch for some reasons she couldn’t immediately name. The man, he was tall, dark haired, dressed in black with eyes the colour of embers in a dying fire. For a split second, his gaze locked on hers and the mark on her shoulder blade flared suddenly, a pulse of heat so intense she gasped. 
The man’s jaw tightened, and he stepped aside, hands dropping. “My fault, I wasn’t watching.” His voice was low and deliberate. 
Then he was gone. Amari stood there, heart pounding, shoulder blade burning. 
Eira exhaled beside her. “Well, that was fun.”
“Who-“
“Kael Varin. ”Eira pulled Amari toward a table in the back, near the window. “And before you ask, yes, he’s a vampire. Trueblood, old family, old blood, dangerous.”
Amari sank into her chair. The mark still throbbed, a slow pulse that wouldn’t quit. “He looked… normal.”
“That’s the problem.” Eira flagged down a server. “Kael’s the nice one. It’s his brother you’ve got to worry about?”
“His brother?”
“Ilay Varin. He runs the southern quarter and by ‘runs’ I means controls with an iron fist. People go missing around him. Lots of people.” Eira’s voice dropped. “Dad says Ilay’s the reason most of the other Trueblood left town. But Kael stayed. Even though everyone knows Illay’s a monster, he’s loyal to the guy. Or he’s just stupid.”
Amari rubbed her arms trying to shake the lingering warmth of Kael’s hands. “Does Kael know about that…..”
“About supernatural stuff? ” Eira snorted. “He is supernatural stuff. But if you are asking if he knows about you specifically, probably not. Unless…” She tilted her head. “Did something happen just now? You look weird.”
“No,” Amari lied. “Just surprised. I’ve never met a Trueblood before.”
“Well, now you have. Try not to make a habit of it.”
They ordered coffee and pastries. Amari picked at hers, appetite gone. Across the room, she caught glimpses of Kael through the crowd, leaning against the far wall, talking to someone she couldn’t see. He hadn’t looked back at her once. So why did her shoulder blade still feel like it was on fire? 
“Do you ever get used to it?” Amari asked quietly. 
“Used to what?”
“The feeling that everything here is watching you?”
Eira was quiet for a moment, stirring coffee. “I am surprised you noticed, most humans, even the ones who were born here never notice. Delmoor’s different from other towns. It feels alive, like the streets have a pulse. You’ll get used to it eventually. Or you won’t and you’ll leave.” She looked up, meeting Amari’s eyes. ” Most people leave.”
“What about you? Are you going to leave?”
“Dad wants me to go to college. Normal life, normal education.” Eira’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. “I’m still deciding.”
“But you’re not like him, right? Not a witch?”
“Nope. Just a regular human. Got my mom’s genes, I guess.” Eira looked away. “She died when I was little. Cancer.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Thanks.” Eira drained her coffee. “Anyway. Tell me about you. Aunt Suzan said you’re in university?”
Amari welcomed the subject change. “Mh, nursing, this is my final year.” 
“Heavy. All that blood and people dying on you.” 
Amari shot her a look, but Eira’s expression was genuinely curious, not mocking. “Someone has to do it.” 
“I guess.” Eira leaned back. “Does my dad, has he told you anything about the ritual? What to expect?” 
There it was. The question Amari had been avoiding since she arrived. 
“He said it’ll buy me time. “She kept her voice level. “Not a cure… Just … time.” 
 “How much time do you have? Total?” 
Most people didn’t ask directly. Most people danced around it with soft voices and careful words. But Eira asked it like she was asking about the weather which Amari found it almost refreshing.  
“Twenty-five years from when the parasite attached. We found the mark three years ago, when I was seventeen, but we think it had been there for at least six months before that.” Amari did the math she’d done a thousand times, the numbers burned into her brain like a brand. “I turn twenty-one next month. Best case scenario, I make it to twenty-five. Worst case….” She trailed off 
“So you have maybe four years left.” Eira said quietly. “Five if you’re lucky.”
“Four years and one month.” Amari corrected then immediately wished she hadn’t. It sounded worse when she said it out loud, more real. “Give or take.” 
Eira drummed her fingers on the table. “My dad is one of the strongest witches in Delmoor. Big family history and lots of knowledge. He’s seen a lot of people die.” Her voice went soft. “Too many, probably, I think that’s why he can’t let your case go. He keeps thinking there must be something everyone else missed.”
Amari’s chest tightened. She’d spent three years hoping for that, for someone to find the thing everyone else had overlooked, the loophole in her death sentence. She wanted to live.  But the hope was exhausting, and she’d learned to live without it. 
“You’re, okay?” Eira noticed the drop in her expression. 
“Fine, just tired.”
“You keep saying that.”
“Because it keeps being true.” 
Eira studied her for a moment, then stood. “Come on. Let’s get you back before Aunt Suzan sends a search party. It’s getting late anyway.” 
Amari glanced at the window. The sun had shifted lower, fog creeping back through the streets. Had they really been here that long? They left The Grill, stepping into cool afternoon air. The streets had emptied, most people retreating indoors as shadows lengthened. 
“Shortcut’s through here,” Eira said, nodding toward a narrow street veiled in dim light. “It is faster than the main road.” 
Amari followed her, the stones slick under her feet. Halfway through the lane, the air changed, quieter, heavier. Then a voice cut through the silence. 
“Evening.” 
Amari froze. Kael stood a few paces ahead, one shoulder against the stone wall, the light catching in his dark hair. He looked perfectly at ease, like he’d been waiting for them.  
Eira stopped beside Amari, expression guarded. “Kael.” 
“Eira,” He inclined his head politely. “Didn’t expect to see you out this way.”
“Just taking Amari home,” her voice had gone carefully neutral. “I was showing her around.”
Kael’s gaze moved to Amari and for an instant, something unreadable crossed his face, curiosity? Recognition? It was gone before she could name it. 
“You are new,” he said, not a question. 
Amari’s voice came out steadier than she felt. “So I’ve been told.”
His eyes lingered on her and the mark on her back answered with a slow burn that crawled up her spine. She couldn’t hide the wince this time.  
Kael’s brow furrowed. “You’re hurt.”
“I’m fine,” The lie came quickly. “Just tired.”
“Delmoor does that,” he said quietly. “It doesn’t take kindly to outsiders.” 
“Maybe I’ll earn its kindness.”
“Or its attention,” he murmured, almost to himself. 
Eira cleared her throat, stepping slightly forward. “We should go, Aunt Suzan’s waiting.” 
Kael’s lips curved, something between a smile and a warning. “Then you shouldn’t keep her waiting.”
He moved aside, and they passed him. Cedar and smoke clung to him, sharp and wrong, and for a moment the fog seemed to bend toward his shadow. When Amari looked back, he was gone. 
They walked in silence until they reached the crossroads where the streetlights burned brighter, cutting through the mist. 
“Uhm,” She said coming to a stop. She pulled a sheet of paper from her pocket. “Do you maybe recognize this writing? I figured I should ask since your father is a witch.” 
Eira reached for the paper. “ Where did you get this? I can’t quite figure out the words but it is similar to my father’s spell.” 
“They were on my bed when I woke up.” 
“I’ll ask father for help when I get home.” Amari’s eyes flickered under the bright light to look at her. “I won’t tell him it’s yours if you don’t want to.” 
Amari sighed as she glanced over her shoulder one more time expecting to see nothing. A figure stood at the mouth of the alley. Kael, half turned toward her, not moving, not speaking. His eyes caught the streetlight, bright as embers. 
Then the fog swallowed him. 
Amari’s hands trembled. The mark on her back throbbed once, then settled, warm and quiet like a promise she didn’t understand.  
“Eira,” she whispered. “How do you know when a place has claimed you?”
Eira hesitated, her face shadowed by the streetlight’s edge. “When leaving stops feeling like an option.”
Amari didn’t answer. Somewhere deep in her chest, she suspected Delmoor had already decided.",1,1762354240.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Never ended up in a relationship but was exclusive and more serious towards the last couple months. The final week she started pulling away and i knew what was coming, she avoided me the entire weekend while i was in her city but fed little breadcrumbs such as feel so sick at my hockey but still excuses for why she’s too busy to meet for coffee. “I’ll let you know” but never did, then blanked my message from 10pm-11am (wonder why)

Finally she ended it the night i got back home without seeing her and did it over text (even though i had asked to phone tonight about the weekend), cited busyness, distance and feels guilty making me put in so much effort so not fair and just being realistic. I argued a bit, but softly. Like i was hurt and trying to be nice in hopes to fix things, saying shit like “it is what it is, i want to work on it not end it”. Deep down I knew it was over and felt i was going to end it but she pulled the plug first. Every time i’d argue her reasoning, she’d switch to a different reasoning and downplay my feelings. Ended up saying it wasn’t even that serious between us, she’s not ready to be someone’s girlfriend (after saying she’s my future gf for 2/3 months, and doing literally everything someones future gf would do). 

A few weeks on ive seen just how bullshit her way out was and it infuriates me, moreso how she got off so scot-free and i didn’t call out her bullshit and just went silent after she changed to her 8th reason for ending it lol (ended up being her anxiety and needing to focus on herself). I think she’s avoidant, 80% sure she is; 20% she was using me for attention. I really wish I called out every contradiction now I see it all clearly but at the time was blinded and so blindsided. I do understand i’d never change her mind, and for the best, but i wish she knew i seen through her rubbish; she probably thinks im still an emotional idiot. Anyone felt that way before?

2. Tonight i am thinking about you a lot
3. You can ignore me but you can't ignore a good coffee
4. I know it's too early to say I love you but i like you a lot
5. Good coffee will always find you

Asshole is still denying and claiming he did not send any of these. I am not stupid. He just replaced me with that woman. I even found her pictures and she is nothing compared to me.

Original post: My husband (31M) and me (31F) have been married for 7 years, 10 years of relationship in total. Recently he told me he is not attracted to me anymore and he needs to figure himself out (his started a new work and it's been stressful). He told me he wants to take a break and at first I wanted to be supportive and gave him the space he needed. But I can't. We have been very intimate, loved each other so much. When he was abroad, we were like talking 24/7, missed each other much. For the past couple months, we did not have sex and turns out he was stressing out about it in his mind. We don't have children, but we have a cat. He says he is not sure that he will love me ever again, and if his emotions toward me would come back. He says he ""loves"" me and cares about me and doesn't want me to be hurting. Also he didn't want to hide everything and lie to me or himself about his feelings and spilt it all out. I mean this is 10 years of relationship we are talking about. I was about to move abroad but he refused since he has a career here. I offered him to sacrifice all I have and stay with him and try to work on our relationship and be a better wife but he says he's sorry and wants to leave me. Do you think I have a chance? If we take a break, that means I am moving abroad. Then that's not gonna be taking a break, that means we are over. He claims there is no other women in his life. His friend suggested to let me go abroad and figure things out. He went to his friend first before talking to me. I feel like his friend made a decision on our relationship. What should I do?

1op4rhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1op4rhw/my_25f_boyfriend_23m_used_to_coerce_me_into_it/,"My (25F) boyfriend (23M) used to coerce me into it. Years later, my body still rejects him.","We got together pretty young, back in 2019. It’s been six years now. I was 19 and he was 17. I was a virgin and he wasn’t.

During the pandemic, my dad got very sick. He had cancer and later developed a brain disease. He spent months in the hospital, in the ICU. When he finally came home, he was bedridden and not fully lucid. Later, he got pneumonia and was close to dying. I was completely devastated. My dad was my best friend... I was *daddy’s little girl.*

Seeing him sick and later losing him was the hardest thing I’ve ever faced.

At that time, I was studying hard to get into law school and emotionally falling apart. My sex drive was low (not gone, just... low). One day, while I was sad and talking to my boyfriend about how scared I was that my dad would die, he started groping me, trying to initiate sex. Literally as I said, *“I’m afraid my dad will pass soon.”*

He was 17, so I told myself it was immaturity, hormones, lack of awareness. But that kind of behavior had already been a pattern. He would often try to “get me in the mood” after I’d said no... asking to touch me, to undress, to do things to me even when I said I wasn’t up for it. I often gave in because I didn’t want him to feel rejected or undesired. I thought that was what a good girlfriend was supposed to do.

The last straw was that day when I was grieving and he still tried to get off. I told him I was done. I even told him I almost fell in love with another person who used to be there for me., at the time. Said that I was falling out of love, that what he was doing made me feel coerced and violated.

He forgave me for emotionally cheating and I forgave him for the above.

To his credit, he stopped immediately and has somewhat respected my boundaries ever since. He almost never initiates sex and I do just because when I don't, I feel bad about it. It’s been four years, and he’s never crossed that line again. He uses to make little comments to see if I'm open to it or not.

But something inside me is still broken, even after all that time.

Ever since, I’ve never truly felt physical desire for him again. I'm almost repulsed, even. I fake it. The arousal, the orgasms, the interest. I say I need lube because of birth control, but the truth is, I just don’t get wet. I don’t want to be touched. Sometimes I wonder if I’ve become asexual.

Outside of that, we’ve grown apart too. I’ve become an adult. I graduated, became a lawyer, I work, pay bills, run errands, handle responsibilities. Meanwhile, he still lives like a teenager. He’s in an IT program, plays video games all day, and does his homework. That’s it. He doesn’t drive, doesn’t take public transportation, doesn’t cook, doesn’t clean his room, and has literally never been grocery shopping in his life. His mom takes him everywhere.

When I imagine living with him, I don’t feel excited . I feel anxious. The thought of sharing a life or a home with him feels exhausting. I know I’d end up carrying everything - emotionally, financially, practically - and I already feel drained just thinking about it.

So why do I stay?

I figured a miserable sex life was the price to pay for having a somewhat great partner, on the other areas?

I mean, he’s not a bad person. He’s caring, patient, gentle, affectionate, calm, is always there for me when I need him to. He’s loyal, and he genuinely tries to please me in bed (I promise, trust my word on that, so I don't have to get into too much details, TMI), even though I have to fake it. He’s calm and never pressures me anymore. He learnt how to cook rice, pasta and make coffee for me. He tries to make me feel loved by my love language (acts of service). I know he loves me and I do care about him... but it feels like brotherly affection, not romantic love.

I love hanging out with him for a short amount of time. Not the entire weekend.

I’ve realized I’m staying mostly out of guilt and fear: guilt for hurting him, fear of regretting it, fear of being alone. I keep hoping he’ll change, grow up, become independent… but when he takes small steps in that direction, I just feel nothing. Not pride, not attraction... just impatience.

I think I’ve already emotionally left the relationship, but my body and mind haven’t caught up yet. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I don’t want to marry him out of habit and spend the rest of my life pretending to want sex or affection. I don’t think this is how love should feel, even after years together.

I''m currently on therapy

  
TL;DR: About 4 years ago, my boyfriend would low-key coerce me into being intimate by groping me and asking me to strip even after I said I wasn't on the mood. I used to give in, but the last straw was when he did dad literally as I was talking about how afraid I was about my sick dad passing away. I talked to him about it and he hasn't done it ever since, but I still feel repulsed and obligated every single time... I just want it to end as soon as we start being intimate. I'm leaving him.

This creates an immediate disconnect between what's displayed on the map and what I've heard and I become flummoxed 90% of the time when in unfamiliar territory. I tried switching to Android Auto for Google navigation, but Android Auto's complete Infotainment takeover adds several taps to anything I'd like to do off-phone, such as switching from media to radio, which takes my eyes off the road for more than a beat.

They list out the 15 ingredients used for the scent and I'm wondering how many of those will appear in the Winter 26 bottled fragrance. I know the candles aren't made to be identical to the seasonal scent so it will be interesting to see which ones play a role in both.

We know from the seasonal sneak peek that the fragrance will be a coastal lighthouse theme containing: timut pepper, mimosa, violet leaf, oakmoss, and black tang seaweed, the rest of the ingredients have not been released yet. 

The candle scent heavily features coffee beans (something I hope does not appear in the bottled fragrance for a coastal theme) as well as peru balsam, frankincense, brown-eyed rock rose, tonka bean, cinnamon bark, gurjun balsam, chinese weeping cypress, clove, lavender, myrrh, nutmeg, red cedar, patchouli, and bergamot.

I'm fairly certain the bottled fragrance will contain the bergamot, lavender, red cedar, and probably brown-eyed rock rose. I'd like to see the myrrh, frankincense, and peru balsam return in this next season's scent as well.

I love that the artwork for this candle features the myth of Selkies!

I won't be trying the Winter 26 candle but I'm still very excited to see what's in store for the Winter 26 bottled fragrance!",2,1762353747.0,Ffern,0,0.75,False
1op4o8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1op4o8s/hello_everyone_can_you_please_check_out_my_first/,"Hello everyone, can you please check out my first chapter on the novel i am writing, i would greatly appreciate your feedback. Genre: Romantasy","Heat bloomed beneath the fabric of her pyjamas, sharp and sudden, like spark catching skin. She gasped, her eyes flicking open. The room was dim, filtered in amber light through gauzy curtains and the air smelled faintly of cedar and cold rain. For a moment she forgot where she was, then the unfamiliar creak of the old ceiling reminded her. She had come to Delmoor with her aunt, where her mother used to live. It had been two days, yet the place had begun to feel like it as watching her. 
She lurched out of bed, staggering to her bedroom mirror as she carefully peeled off her pyjama top, wincing and gritting her teeth. As the fabric slid off, she turned, her back to the mirror, her stomach dropped. The mark had grown again. Last week it had been nothing more like a circular sigil on her left shoulder blade, but now, intricate, winding lines that looked almost like roots or veins, branching downwards along her spine.  The lines were darker, more defined, almost like letters, no not letters, symbols. Ancient ones. She traced it with shaking fingers, it was warm, alive. A tear scaped before she could stop it. She blinked it away, swallowing the lump in her throat. 
Three years of this, three years of watching the mark spread, of doctors shaking their hands, witches sighing at their failing spells and of Suzan crying when she thought Amari couldn’t hear. The only response she ever got was that an ancient witch had possessed her body. Four years and one month left, before her body is taken over and she dies.  
She turned back to the room and froze. Sheets of paper lay scattered across her bed like someone had thrown them in a fit. Her handwriting, jagged ink strokes, looping and uneven, covering every sheet. 
“What the hell?” She pulled one closer trying to read the text. The papers quivered slightly as, as much as she had no recollection of writing it, she lacked the ability to make sense of any sentence written. The structure though, resembled that of a witch’s spell, having spent enough time visiting them to recognize the writing. She snatched them up and shoved them into her drawer before her aunt could walk in and found her whispering nonsense to empty air again. 
A knock rattled on the door. “Amari? You awake?” Suzan’s voice was bright, forced. “Eira’s coming by soon remember? Malek’s daughter? She wanted to show you around.”
Amari sighed loudly. Right, the tour. The witch’s daughter playing welcome wagon for the dying girl. “Yeah, I’ll be ready.”
By the time she made it downstairs, showered and dressed in jeans and an oversized t-shirt that hid the mark, a girl was perched on the bottom step like she’d been carved there. She had her father’s sharp cheekbones and dark eyes, but where Malek moved with careful deliberation, his daughter vibrated with energy. She looked up from her phone and grinned. 
“You must be Amari Brown.” She extended her hand for a handshake. “Dad said you’ve been hiding upstairs for two days straight. Figured someone should drag you into sunlight before you turn into a vampire yourself.” 
Amari shook her hand, managing a smile. “I wasn’t hiding, Just tired.”
“Uh-huh. Come I’ll show you the parts of Delmoor that won’t kill you.” Eira stood and headed for the door. 
They stepped outside into the cool air. Delmoor sprawled before them. All narrow streets and old houses with peaked roofs, nothing like Mountain Hill’s suburbs. People walked past, some human, some definitely not, going about their morning like this town wasn’t the strangest place Amari had ever seen. She missed her brother; Riley would’ve loved this. He’d been taking notes, asking million questions, probably trying to befriend the first supernatural creature he met. Instead, he was back home finishing midterms while she was here chasing a maybe, a possibly, a witch who might buy her a few more years. If she was lucky. 
“So,” Eira glanced at her sideways as they walked. “You’ve been here two days and im guessing you’ve seen the inside of one bedroom and maybe the bathroom. That about right? 
“The kitchen too. Once.” 
“Living dangerously.” Eira chuckled. She looked as if she were trying to start a conversation with her but unable to reach through. “You always this much of a hermit or is Delmoor freaking you out?” 
Amari shrugged, it was a bit of both, but she wasn’t about to dump her anxiety on a girl she’d known for five minutes. “Just adjusting.” 
“Yeah well, adjust faster. If you stay cooped up much longer people are gonna think you’re scared of us.”
“Maybe I am.”
Eira laughed. “Smart girl.”
They turned down a wider street where shops clustered together, morning sun breaking through the fog. Amari caught scents she shouldn’t be able to identify, sulfer, ozone, something sweet and wrong that made her nose itch. The mark on her back pulsed once, warm, like it was paying attention. She ignored it. 
“There.” Eira pointed to a building trailing with ivy, warm light spilling from its windows. “The Grill. It’s where everyone hangs out. You want coffee? Food? Dad gave me money and im pretty sure it was guilt money, so we should spend it.”
“Guilt money?”
“For making you move here for the ritual. ”Eira’s tone went carefully casual. “He feels bad about that.”
Amari’s chest tightened. “He shouldn’t. It’s not his fault; I really am grateful to him.”
“Tell him that. He’s been obsessing over your case for months; said he owed you mother a favour.” Eira pushed open the door.  “Come on.”
The Grill was packed, students hunched over laptops, older folks nursing coffee, a group in the corner that had to be vampires based on how still they sat. The air smelled like espresso and something else, something Amari couldn’t name but felt in her teeth. 
Magic. The place hummed with it. 
They’d barely stepped inside when someone walked straight into Amari. 
“Shit, sorry-“ 
Hands caught and steadied her, warm and solid against her arms. Amari found herself looking up into a face that made her breath catch for some reasons she couldn’t immediately name. The man, he was tall, dark haired, dressed in black with eyes the colour of embers in a dying fire. For a split second, his gaze locked on hers and the mark on her shoulder blade flared suddenly, a pulse of heat so intense she gasped. 
The man’s jaw tightened, and he stepped aside, hands dropping. “My fault, I wasn’t watching.” His voice was low and deliberate. 
Then he was gone. Amari stood there, heart pounding, shoulder blade burning. 
Eira exhaled beside her. “Well, that was fun.”
“Who-“
“Kael Varin. ”Eira pulled Amari toward a table in the back, near the window. “And before you ask, yes, he’s a vampire. Trueblood, old family, old blood, dangerous.”
Amari sank into her chair. The mark still throbbed, a slow pulse that wouldn’t quit. “He looked… normal.”
“That’s the problem.” Eira flagged down a server. “Kael’s the nice one. It’s his brother you’ve got to worry about?”
“His brother?”
“Ilay Varin. He runs the southern quarter and by ‘runs’ I means controls with an iron fist. People go missing around him. Lots of people.” Eira’s voice dropped. “Dad says Ilay’s the reason most of the other Trueblood left town. But Kael stayed. Even though everyone knows Illay’s a monster, he’s loyal to the guy. Or he’s just stupid.”
Amari rubbed her arms trying to shake the lingering warmth of Kael’s hands. “Does Kael know about that…..”
“About supernatural stuff? ” Eira snorted. “He is supernatural stuff. But if you are asking if he knows about you specifically, probably not. Unless…” She tilted her head. “Did something happen just now? You look weird.”
“No,” Amari lied. “Just surprised. I’ve never met a Trueblood before.”
“Well, now you have. Try not to make a habit of it.”
They ordered coffee and pastries. Amari picked at hers, appetite gone. Across the room, she caught glimpses of Kael through the crowd, leaning against the far wall, talking to someone she couldn’t see. He hadn’t looked back at her once. So why did her shoulder blade still feel like it was on fire? 
“Do you ever get used to it?” Amari asked quietly. 
“Used to what?”
“The feeling that everything here is watching you?”
Eira was quiet for a moment, stirring coffee. “I am surprised you noticed, most humans, even the ones who were born here never notice. Delmoor’s different from other towns. It feels alive, like the streets have a pulse. You’ll get used to it eventually. Or you won’t and you’ll leave.” She looked up, meeting Amari’s eyes. ” Most people leave.”
“What about you? Are you going to leave?”
“Dad wants me to go to college. Normal life, normal education.” Eira’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. “I’m still deciding.”
“But you’re not like him, right? Not a witch?”
“Nope. Just a regular human. Got my mom’s genes, I guess.” Eira looked away. “She died when I was little. Cancer.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Thanks.” Eira drained her coffee. “Anyway. Tell me about you. Aunt Suzan said you’re in university?”
Amari welcomed the subject change. “Mh, nursing, this is my final year.” 
“Heavy. All that blood and people dying on you.” 
Amari shot her a look, but Eira’s expression was genuinely curious, not mocking. “Someone has to do it.” 
“I guess.” Eira leaned back. “Does my dad, has he told you anything about the ritual? What to expect?” 
There it was. The question Amari had been avoiding since she arrived. 
“He said it’ll buy me time. “She kept her voice level. “Not a cure… Just … time.” 
 “How much time do you have? Total?” 
Most people didn’t ask directly. Most people danced around it with soft voices and careful words. But Eira asked it like she was asking about the weather which Amari found it almost refreshing.  
“Twenty-five years from when the parasite attached. We found the mark three years ago, when I was seventeen, but we think it had been there for at least six months before that.” Amari did the math she’d done a thousand times, the numbers burned into her brain like a brand. “I turn twenty-one next month. Best case scenario, I make it to twenty-five. Worst case….” She trailed off 
“So you have maybe four years left.” Eira said quietly. “Five if you’re lucky.”
“Four years and one month.” Amari corrected then immediately wished she hadn’t. It sounded worse when she said it out loud, more real. “Give or take.” 
Eira drummed her fingers on the table. “My dad is one of the strongest witches in Delmoor. Big family history and lots of knowledge. He’s seen a lot of people die.” Her voice went soft. “Too many, probably, I think that’s why he can’t let your case go. He keeps thinking there must be something everyone else missed.”
Amari’s chest tightened. She’d spent three years hoping for that, for someone to find the thing everyone else had overlooked, the loophole in her death sentence. She wanted to live.  But the hope was exhausting, and she’d learned to live without it. 
“You’re, okay?” Eira noticed the drop in her expression. 
“Fine, just tired.”
“You keep saying that.”
“Because it keeps being true.” 
Eira studied her for a moment, then stood. “Come on. Let’s get you back before Aunt Suzan sends a search party. It’s getting late anyway.” 
Amari glanced at the window. The sun had shifted lower, fog creeping back through the streets. Had they really been here that long? They left The Grill, stepping into cool afternoon air. The streets had emptied, most people retreating indoors as shadows lengthened. 
“Shortcut’s through here,” Eira said, nodding toward a narrow street veiled in dim light. “It is faster than the main road.” 
Amari followed her, the stones slick under her feet. Halfway through the lane, the air changed, quieter, heavier. Then a voice cut through the silence. 
“Evening.” 
Amari froze. Kael stood a few paces ahead, one shoulder against the stone wall, the light catching in his dark hair. He looked perfectly at ease, like he’d been waiting for them.  
Eira stopped beside Amari, expression guarded. “Kael.” 
“Eira,” He inclined his head politely. “Didn’t expect to see you out this way.”
“Just taking Amari home,” her voice had gone carefully neutral. “I was showing her around.”
Kael’s gaze moved to Amari and for an instant, something unreadable crossed his face, curiosity? Recognition? It was gone before she could name it. 
“You are new,” he said, not a question. 
Amari’s voice came out steadier than she felt. “So I’ve been told.”
His eyes lingered on her and the mark on her back answered with a slow burn that crawled up her spine. She couldn’t hide the wince this time.  
Kael’s brow furrowed. “You’re hurt.”
“I’m fine,” The lie came quickly. “Just tired.”
“Delmoor does that,” he said quietly. “It doesn’t take kindly to outsiders.” 
“Maybe I’ll earn its kindness.”
“Or its attention,” he murmured, almost to himself. 
Eira cleared her throat, stepping slightly forward. “We should go, Aunt Suzan’s waiting.” 
Kael’s lips curved, something between a smile and a warning. “Then you shouldn’t keep her waiting.”
He moved aside, and they passed him. Cedar and smoke clung to him, sharp and wrong, and for a moment the fog seemed to bend toward his shadow. When Amari looked back, he was gone. 
They walked in silence until they reached the crossroads where the streetlights burned brighter, cutting through the mist. 
“Uhm,” She said coming to a stop. She pulled a sheet of paper from her pocket. “Do you maybe recognize this writing? I figured I should ask since your father is a witch.” 
Eira reached for the paper. “ Where did you get this? I can’t quite figure out the words but it is similar to my father’s spell.” 
“They were on my bed when I woke up.” 
“I’ll ask father for help when I get home.” Amari’s eyes flickered under the bright light to look at her. “I won’t tell him it’s yours if you don’t want to.” 
Amari sighed as she glanced over her shoulder one more time expecting to see nothing. A figure stood at the mouth of the alley. Kael, half turned toward her, not moving, not speaking. His eyes caught the streetlight, bright as embers. 
Then the fog swallowed him. 
Amari’s hands trembled. The mark on her back throbbed once, then settled, warm and quiet like a promise she didn’t understand.  
“Eira,” she whispered. “How do you know when a place has claimed you?”
Eira hesitated, her face shadowed by the streetlight’s edge. “When leaving stops feeling like an option.”
Amari didn’t answer. Somewhere deep in her chest, she suspected Delmoor had already decided.",2,1762353703.0,writers,2,1.0,False

1op4mfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesForMyTherapist/comments/1op4mfr/one_of_the_strangest_findings_in_quantum_physics/,"“One of the strangest findings in quantum physics is something called the observer effect. Physicists have studied how tiny particles, like electrons, behave when no one is watching.","In experiments such as the famous double-slit experiment, these particles act like waves, spreading out and behaving unpredictably. But when scientists measure or “observe” them, they act like solid particles instead. In other words, the outcome changes depending on whether someone is paying attention.

This strange result suggests that consciousness, or awareness, has a direct influence on how reality works at the smallest level. If our act of observing can shape the physical world, it raises an unsettling question: could life and death also be influenced by consciousness in ways we do not yet understand? If observation matters that much, maybe death is not as simple as lights out, but instead tied to how awareness continues.


Dr. Robert Lanza, a respected scientist, developed a theory called biocentrism. Instead of seeing life as a small byproduct of the universe, he suggests that life is actually at the center of everything. According to biocentrism, space and time are not fixed structures outside of us. Instead, they are tools our minds use to make sense of the world.

Think of it like a video game. In the game, landscapes and timelines appear real, but they only exist because the program is running and the player is interacting with it. In a similar way, biocentrism argues that the universe exists because consciousness is there to experience it. If this is true, then death may not be a permanent ending. Instead, it could simply be a change in how our consciousness interacts with reality.

Quantum mechanics has also given rise to the idea of quantum immortality. This idea comes from the many worlds interpretation, which suggests that there are countless universes existing side by side. Every time an event occurs, reality may split into multiple versions, each one carrying out a different possibility.

For example, in one version of the universe, you spill your coffee. In another version, you do not. Both outcomes exist in different realities. When it comes to life-and-death situations, this idea becomes even stranger. Quantum immortality suggests that in at least one version of the universe, your consciousness always continues. From your own perspective, you never experience death because you only remain aware in the version where you survive.

Of course, this theory does not mean you live forever in the way people usually imagine. Instead, it points to the possibility that consciousness continues in some form, shifting into versions of reality where survival continues. It challenges our assumption that death is an absolute wall.

Albert Einstein showed us that time and space are not fixed and absolute, but relative. Time can move faster or slower depending on speed and gravity. This was a major shift from how people had always thought about the universe. Quantum physics pushes this idea further, suggesting that time and space may not exist outside of our perception at all.

If time and space are flexible, then death may not be a single final moment on a universal clock. Instead, it could be more like changing how we view reality, the way perspective changes when we look at an object from a different angle. What feels like an ending from one viewpoint could simply be a transformation when seen from another.”

Physicist David Bohm proposed another perspective known as the implicate order. He suggested that the universe is not made up of separate, isolated things, but instead is one flowing, interconnected whole. In this view, what we see as separate events- like the beginning of life or the moment of death- are only temporary appearances within a larger, unified process.

If Bohm’s theory is correct, then death may not be the absolute end of a person. Instead, it might be a change within the larger pattern of existence, a shift in how energy and consciousness flow through the universe. What we call “life” and “death” might simply be two sides of the same ongoing process.”

1op4kua,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1op4kua/which_one_of_these_guys_to_go_for/,Which one of these guys to go for,"I’m facing a bit of a dilemma.

 I(29F) have been hanging out as friends with this guy(28M) that I’ve met through a mutual friend.  We mostly hung out in groups, but sometimes we’d go out alone to eat or for a coffee.

To be honest I fancied him a bit from the start, he’s really good looking, tall, athletic with a full beard and thick set of hair. He kinda “doesn’t care” about his appearance, because he isn’t really into fashion nor does he take particular care of his hair, not that he doesn’t wash himself or anything, but just isn’t obsessed about his looks, which I honestly also kinda find attracting since I’m not really into guys which are “shallow” like that. 

He’s also successful, he’s used to be in the military, and still serves in the reserves, after finishing his military contract he finished college, worked briefly for a large international company before starting his own which now numbers about 15 employees.

Recently he called me for a  coffee, which wasn’t unusual, but then blindsided me with a confession that he had a romantic interest in me for some time now. As I found myself blindsided I just blurted out that I also felt the same about him, and told him that he should have asked sooner(jokingly off course). 

Now where the dilemma comes from is that there is another guy (29M) who I’ve been friends for years now. I always fancied him but most of the time either him or I have been in a relationship. He came out of a relationship few months ago, and I didn’t want to make my move immediately since I wanted to give him time to heal, but then he got involved with another girl, with whom he broke up recently. So I decided that this time I won’t wait, and I wanted to make my move in the coming days, but then the situation with the other guy occured.

The first guy is, on paper, better in every aspect than the second guy, but with the second guy I have a lot deeper emotional connection, and is somebody who I have been interested in for years now. The issue with the second guy is also that he lives back in my home country, but returning to my home country is something that I have been pondering for some time now. I’m pretty sure that he feels the same about me, and he did sort of make a move on me few years back which I for some reason rejected and have been regretting ever since.

Has anybody ever been in such a situation, do you have any advice for me?",0,1762353478.0,dating_advice,7,0.5,False

“The Translation Movement Between East and West, with a Special Focus on the Late Translation Movement”

A) Intro

From the earliest periods of recorded history until today, translation has played a crucial role in disseminating scientific knowledge. The translation movement has been one of the most important and powerful tools in the exchange of knowledge and in the development of science.

During the medieval period, as a result of the famous Graeco-Arabic translation movement, Arabic emerged as a ‘lingua franca’ of scientific exchange. For most of the medieval and early modern periods, Latin was the ‘lingua franca’ of scientific exchange. Then, we started to see the reverse translation movement from different European languages into Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman.

In order to shed light into this important aspect of the scientific exchange and cultural fusion between East and West; and

In light of the success of the previous symposium under the title “The Translation Movement Between East and West” (which took place in November 2023); based on the proposals that came out during that symposium; taking into consideration that there were some aspects related to this topic that were not covered; and, in order to focus more on the Third Translation Movement, i.e., from Latin / European Languages to Arabic, Ottoman Turkish, Persian and other languages in the pre-modern and early modern era…

We are organising this symposium under the title “The Translation Movement Between East and West, with a Special Focus on the Late Translation Movement”.

1op4icf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/1op4icf/question_about_paper_products_in_thailand/,Question about paper products in Thailand,"Hi!  First visit to Thailand and I'm noticing something very strange. No matter where I go,  finding paper products worth a darn is nearly impossible.   From tissues for your nose, to toilet paper for your bum, to paper towels to clean and even antiseptic and baby wipes...the quality is so THIN!.  Even in the most expensive hotels, restaurants and spas.  Does anyone know why this is?  

I've also noticed no one will voluntarily provide you these items either.  For example, in a restaurant, coffee shop or bar.  You never receive a napkin with your order.  You have to ask.  Often I get odd looks for asking too.  

There's never a place you can just grab what you need. Like in the USA.  You go into any venue that provides food or drink and they just provide napkins.  Generally thick ones that actually absorb wetness.   😆 

I've found many malls that had bathrooms so fancy they make Vegas Top Tier Venues look like truck stop pits.  But yet!  No decent toilet tissue or such.  Bum guns are everywhere.  Bathrooms are almost always staffed and kept immaculate.  Yet, the tp is so thin you need to create a mitten around your hand to prevent touching your own mess. And I've yet to see seat liners.  I see dispensers of antiseptic to clean the seat, but no means to apply it. Other than your hand????  😝  The inevitable wetness that happens in these areas leave you feeling a little ( or me, a lot) nervous and grossed out.

Is there a shortage?  Is there a cultural issue i'm not informed of?  I would truly love to understand.  Thank you kindly for any advice.

Please allow me to state, I absolutely love it here.  The people are warm and friendly.  Service is wonderful wherever you go.  In no way am I knocking the people or the country. I just want to understand.  Thanks! 🫶",3,1762353319.0,Thailand,11,0.67,False

1op4hd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1op4hd7/my_25f_boyfriend_23m_used_to_coerce_me_into_it/,"My (25F) boyfriend (23M) used to coerce me into it. Years later, my body still rejects him.","We got together pretty young, back in 2019. It’s been six years now. I was 19 and he was 17. I was a virgin and he wasn’t.

During the pandemic, my dad got very sick. He had cancer and later developed a brain disease. He spent months in the hospital, in the ICU. When he finally came home, he was bedridden and not fully lucid. Later, he got pneumonia and was close to dying. I was completely devastated. My dad was my best friend... I was *daddy’s little girl.*

Seeing him sick and later losing him was the hardest thing I’ve ever faced.

At that time, I was studying hard to get into law school and emotionally falling apart. My sex drive was low (not gone, just... low). One day, while I was sad and talking to my boyfriend about how scared I was that my dad would die, he started groping me, trying to initiate sex. Literally as I said, *“I’m afraid my dad will pass soon.”*

He was 17, so I told myself it was immaturity, hormones, lack of awareness. But that kind of behavior had already been a pattern. He would often try to “get me in the mood” after I’d said no... asking to touch me, to undress, to do things to me even when I said I wasn’t up for it. I often gave in because I didn’t want him to feel rejected or undesired. I thought that was what a good girlfriend was supposed to do.

The last straw was that day when I was grieving and he still tried to get off. I told him I was done. I even told him I almost fell in love with another person who used to be there for me., at the time. Said that I was falling out of love, that what he was doing made me feel coerced and violated.

He forgave me for emotionally cheating and I forgave him for the above.

To his credit, he stopped immediately and has somewhat respected my boundaries ever since. He almost never initiates sex and I do just because when I don't, I feel bad about it. It’s been four years, and he’s never crossed that line again. He uses to make little comments to see if I'm open to it or not.

But something inside me is still broken, even after all that time.

Ever since, I’ve never truly felt physical desire for him again. I'm almost repulsed, even. I fake it. The arousal, the orgasms, the interest. I say I need lube because of birth control, but the truth is, I just don’t get wet. I don’t want to be touched. Sometimes I wonder if I’ve become asexual.

Outside of that, we’ve grown apart too. I’ve become an adult. I graduated, became a lawyer, I work, pay bills, run errands, handle responsibilities. Meanwhile, he still lives like a teenager. He’s in an IT program, plays video games all day, and does his homework. That’s it. He doesn’t drive, doesn’t take public transportation, doesn’t cook, doesn’t clean his room, and has literally never been grocery shopping in his life. His mom takes him everywhere.

When I imagine living with him, I don’t feel excited . I feel anxious. The thought of sharing a life or a home with him feels exhausting. I know I’d end up carrying everything - emotionally, financially, practically - and I already feel drained just thinking about it.

So why do I stay? 

I figured a miserable sex life was the price to pay for having a somewhat great partner, on the other areas? 

I mean, he’s not a bad person. He’s caring, patient, gentle, affectionate, calm, is always there for me when I need him to. He’s loyal, and he genuinely tries to please me in bed (I promise, trust my word on that, so I don't have to get into too much details, TMI), even though I have to fake it. He’s calm and never pressures me anymore. He learnt how to cook rice, pasta and make coffee for me. He tries to make me feel loved by my love language (acts of service). I know he loves me and I do care about him... but it feels like brotherly affection, not romantic love.

I love hanging out with him for a short amount of time. Not the entire weekend. 

I’ve realized I’m staying mostly out of guilt and fear: guilt for hurting him, fear of regretting it, fear of being alone. I keep hoping he’ll change, grow up, become independent… but when he takes small steps in that direction, I just feel nothing. Not pride, not attraction... just impatience.


I think I’ve already emotionally left the relationship, but my body and mind haven’t caught up yet. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I don’t want to marry him out of habit and spend the rest of my life pretending to want sex or affection. I don’t think this is how love should feel, even after years together.
