Sure thing! Here’s your informal blog review using **""Harvard - Psychology of Leadership - Tal Ben-Shahar (2006)""** naturally as keywords, following your requested style — easy to read, 5W1H answered, with headings:

# What is ""Harvard - Psychology of Leadership - Tal Ben-Shahar (2006)"" All About?

If you’ve ever wondered what makes a great leader *tick*, you’re gonna love **Harvard - Psychology of Leadership - Tal Ben-Shahar (2006)**. It’s basically a full Harvard course that digs deep into the mind of a leader — from how they set goals to how they tell stories, inspire change, and drive motivation. Tal Ben-Shahar (aka the happiness professor) mixes psychology, leadership theory, and practical real-world advice, making it both brainy *and* super usable. Whether you’re dreaming of leading a company, a classroom, or a movement, this course dishes out the real-deal knowledge.

# Who Should Check This Out?

Short answer? Anyone who wants to level up their leadership skills. **Harvard - Psychology of Leadership - Tal Ben-Shahar (2006)** is perfect for entrepreneurs, managers, politicians, teachers — really, *anyone* who deals with groups of people and wants to do it better. Even if you’re just curious about psychology and leadership in general, there’s a ton to soak up here. And don’t worry if you’re not a ""textbook"" learner — Tal’s style is super relatable, not all stiff and boring.

# Where’s the Action Happening?

Well, the original magic happened at Harvard College back in 2005–2006. But thanks to the upload, now you can dive into **Harvard - Psychology of Leadership - Tal Ben-Shahar (2006)** from literally anywhere. Your bedroom, coffee shop, office... wherever you can fire up a screen and get comfy. Plus, the materials (videos, readings, slides, docs) are all bundled together nicely — just be ready for a few mix-ups since the course didn’t exactly stick to the original syllabus plan (but hey, real life isn’t perfect either, right?).

# When’s the Best Time to Start?

Honestly? Right now. Leadership isn’t something you magically learn when you get promoted or start a company. It's a skill you *grow* over time. **Harvard - Psychology of Leadership - Tal Ben-Shahar (2006)** gives you the kind of foundation you wish you had before stepping into any leadership role. Plus, the topics like transformational leadership, motivation, ethics, and peak performance are timeless. You’ll be able to use these ideas today, tomorrow, and years from now.

# Why is This Course Special?

What sets **Harvard - Psychology of Leadership - Tal Ben-Shahar (2006)** apart is the way it brings together *science* and *soul*. It’s not just dry leadership theory. Tal gets into the *psychology* — why people do what they do, how leaders inspire real change, and how emotions and ethics fit into leadership. Plus, it's not about being a ""boss"" — it's about creating environments where people actually thrive. Big difference, right? Also, Tal’s vibe is super positive and practical, which makes the whole thing way more fun and inspiring.

# How is the Course Structured?

You get 3 big pieces: videos of the lectures (24 in total), a ton of required readings (props to Veil for compiling them!), and some extra documents like PowerPoints and notes. Heads up: the course order in the videos doesn’t always match the official syllabus, but it’s not a huge deal. Just roll with it. If you’re the type who loves to *deep dive*, the readings give extra juice to topics not fully covered in the vids. Basically, you can binge it all Netflix-style or take it slow — whatever floats your boat.

An interesting thing I've noticed lately is that when I'm going through intense emotions and need to self soothe, I lean more into my Vedic moon placement. Here are some examples of things I do to distract/comfort myself and feel better when I'm deep in my Scorpio moon feels:

• Look at property listings and plan out how I would decorate them (search online for wall colors, couches, rugs, art, etc...i could spend hours doing this 😂)

• Google international flights, hotels, and excursions in visually stunning locations and plan a hypothetical vacation 

• Online shop for perfume/clothes/crystals/art for my apt (mostly just browsing Etsy lol)

• open up to my therapist (I feel like this combines my Libra moon's need to talk to someone with my Scorpio moon's need for privacy and emotional security)

• go out on a solo excursion, e.g. a coffee shop, the movies, the park, beach, etc. I like the feeling of being around other people by myself, if that makes sense.

• watch storytime YouTube videos 

I'm curious to see if anyone else resonates with this! What's your moon in Western and in Vedic, and does looking at your Vedic moon placement give you any insight into what your Scorpio moon needs (or vice versa if you normally look at your Vedic chart)? ",1,1744179177.0,scorpiomoon,0,1.0,False

M29, originally from France but spent the last 10 years in the UK. I’ve recently settled back in Paris, and I suppose I still see it a bit like a tourist — walking around with fresh eyes, soaking up the beauty, the architecture, the pulse of the city.

I work remotely in marketing part-time and spend the rest of my time on more creative projects. I’m quite independent and enjoy solitude, but I woke up recently thinking it might be nice to meet a few like-minded people: those who move fluidly between cultures and ways of thinking, and who are open, grounded, and kind.

Some of the things I enjoy: running, yoga, a bit of weightlifting (nothing extreme), time in nature, museums, historical walks, and long conversations. I’m a Buddhist practitioner, so kindness and respect aren’t just nice to have — they’re essential for me. I try to offer them in all my interactions, and I look for the same in return.

Oh, and just to get this out of the way: yes, I’m into spirituality. No, I don’t want you to save my soul. Some have tried. It was hopeless.

I’m not looking to build a huge circle. Just hoping to meet like-minded people who’d enjoy grabbing coffee, a bite to eat, or going for a walk from time to time.

(My days of drunkenly hugging the pavement are behind me. So when I say coffee, I mean coffee. Though tea is fine, too.)

Cheerio,
Tim

My personal favorite, Shirley Temple. 1/2 cherry almond, 1/4 coconut and 1/4 island nectar. If an employee fights that it's three scents, just say sunset getaway and cherry almond. Smells like the drink, at least to me 

Party in the sun is half apple mango or life of the party and half good morning sunshine. They're both fruity scents and they match each other super well.

Area 51 is commando and fruity loopy. Personally never liked this one but it was popular with customers. 

Spa Day is sitting on the dock and shore thing. Not a bad scent.

If they have it, Limone De Sol and Coconut was nice. 

Narcissistic Mirror is Muse and Narcissist, it kinda smells like a perfume. 

Vannilow and Coffee is.... Unique... To say the very least.
 
I can share more when I remember them but I definitely recommend the first two.

1juz0bw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1juz0bw,Hanoi + Sa Pa + Ha Long Bay Vietnam Trip (April 2025),"Travelled with my family (4 pax, mom is a senior)


Day 1 Hanoi

-	Lunch at Bun Cha Dac Kim 

-	Explore Old Quarter

-	St. Joseph Cathedral

-	Café Giang

-	Hanoi Train Street (under repair that time so sarado yung street huhu)

-	Dinner at Banh Xeo Tom Nhay

-	9pm bus ride going to Sa Pa

 

Day 2 Sa Pa

Arrive at 5am. Super lamiggg! Around 11-15 degC. 

-	Fansipan 

-	Hotpot lunch at Mon Ngon Tay Bac

-	Check In at Sapa Centre Hotel 

-	Rest & Shopping

 

Day 3 Sa Pa

-	Mong Village Alpine Coaster

-	Lunch at Lien Ton (nag crave as lechon na iniihaw sa labas haha)

-	Shopping ulit 

-	Foot Massage

-	4pm bus ride to Hanoi

 

Day 4 Ha Long

-	Ha Long Bay Cruise 

 

Day 5

-	Shopping ulit haha (Dong Xuan, Tasco Mall, Aeon Mall)

-	Bought Banh Mi for PH via grabfood na lang

-	Grab to airport


Here’s my takeaways and tips:
Sa Pa
-	We really enjoyed Sa Pa! Everything is just around the corner and ang sarap ng weather! 

-	April is not a good time to visit Fansipan kasi puro fog lang at walang makikita haha. Temp is 4 degC pero keri naman kasi walang gaanong hangin sa summit, mas malamig pa dun sa may cable car station haha.

-	Kung may kasama kayong senior or kids going to Fansipan, bili na rin kayo ng ticket sa monorail going down from Fansipan summit. Yung klook kasi one-way (going up) lang yung kasama sa ticket. Though mas madali naman na sya kasi puro pababa na, mahirap parin sa mga seniors kasi sobrang taas Talaga and ang steep minsan ng stairs

-	I recommend staying in Sapa Centre Hotel – walking distance lang sa sun plaza station with decent price. Got it for 4.5k php for family room

-	Shop at Lee Lee Sportswear Store. This is the most affordable price in town! No need na tumawad kasi super mura na compared to other stores. We bought north face jacket sa Hanoi for 500k vnd pero 250k vnd lang sa store na to. They also accept credit card kaya shopping pa more! hahaha

-	Best thing na na-enjoy naming aside sa shopping ay yung Alpine Coaster! They will offer a second ride for 50% off kaya get nyo na kasi mabibitin kayo sa isang ride lang! Medyo di lang maganda yung view kasi ma-fog tapos may under construction sa katabing site haha

-	Always take Grab kasi nananaga mga taxi drivers haha. If walang grab, check nyo muna yung price sa grab then sabihin nyo sa taxi drivers para di taasan yung presyo

 

Sleeper Bus

-	We got the Interbus Line from Klook

-	Medyo masikip yung sleeper & cabin nila for 2 pax. If you have the budget, get other bus line na more spacious for much comfortable ride

-	Don’t get the front seats! Ang ingay ng busina ng bus jusko haha 

 


Hanoi

-	Traffic is much better than HCM! Hahaha

-	**Don’t stay at Classy Holiday Hotel & Spa!** Nag check in kami around 11pm na and umalis din kami kinubakasan ng 8am for Ha Long Bay. Pag balik naming ng hotel, yung isang bag namin may ngatngat ng daga! Reported it sa reception and sinisisi nila na baka binuksan daw naming yung window pero di naman naming inopen. They only offered a refund of 500k vnd + free shuttle service to airport eh nasa 1.5k php yung bag na nginatngat plus yung food pa na kinain sa loob. Di na kami nakipag talo pa kasi ayaw humarap ng manager and wala rin naman magagawa yung receptionist kasi yun lang daw yung binigay na offer. 

-	Go to Dong Xuan market if gusto mala divisorial na bilihan

-	Go to Tasco Mall Long Bien if gusto nyo mamili sa supermarket

 

Ha Long Bay
-	We avail the Route 2 Ha Long Bay Day Tour by 5-star Hercules Premium Cruise from Klook. Maganda yung interior ng cruise and masarap din yung food. 

-	Medyo scam lang yung tour guide kasi sasabihin wag na dalhin yung free water bottle sa bus for environmental kineme, yun pala may extra charge yung drinks haha 

-	Hindi na naming pinuntahan yung Sung Sot Cave kasi ang taas ng aakyatin. You may check other route depends on your preference

-	For me, hindi worth it pumunta dito kung napunta na kayo ng El Nido or Phuket. They are way better that Ha Long Bay. Almost 4hrs din total travel from Hanoi kaya sayang din sa oras.

As Taking Flight progresses and the Nexus AU expands, expect to see more side stories like this from time to time that I hope you will still enjoy. 

Not a cloud in the sky today as the sun shines over Grace's Landing. The stretch of shops and inns cradled around the docks, where many vessels bob in the water while their owners are off. The Haven Inn stands proudly over its view of the docks. Within one of its penthouse suites, Thad is lazing about on the couch while Lizzy is freshening up in the bathroom. 

Lizzy: Everybody ready? We're heading out in five.

Thad peels himself off the couch and goes for a nice stretch. 

Thad: Just about. 

Lizzy emerges from the bathroom and is immediately displeased with Thad's choice of clothing. While he's still ""presentable,"" she is certain he's been wearing that exact same shirt since they got here two days ago.

Lizzy: Really? 

Thad: Hey! Don't fix what ain't broken. 

Lizzy: *sigh* Whatever. 

She turns her attention the scarlet dressed Boo Gal sitting in the corner, her red eyes scanning through the pages of another horror novel.

Lizzy: Doll? 

The girl quietly gets to her feet and stows the book in her purse. She then gives the two a nod of confirmation. Traffic was mercifully light today as Thad's car glided down the road. Lizzy is checking her phone as usual, Doll is sitting silently in the back seat, and Thad is just happily listening to some tunes while he keeps his eyes on the road. The folks are a lot more ""tame"" than most of the Omnia students he's run across, or that weird plumber he's seen robbing food stores on occasion. Grace's Landing was a far cry from Bricktown with its gorgeous waterside views and a healthy plethora of tourist traps and shops. He's been itching to go somewhere nice, relax, and have fun. All of this was a well needed breath of fresh air, especially after that ""incident"" at Spudsy's. He manages to catch another green light just in time, passing by an Inkling woman carrying a huge box roughly twice her size like it was nothing. 

Thad: *Damn, she must have one helluva routine. Maybe I should start going to the gym again.*

After a long drive, the three finally arrived at their destination. Just across from the beach was the lovely Paradise Mall in all its glory. Thad is the first to disembark and kindly escorts the ladies to the front door, where they are met with rows upon rows of various shops as far as the eye could see. The place wasn't empty by any means, but the hustle and bustle was surprisingly light, even for a weekday. Of course, that leaves more space for the three of them. 

Lizzy: I guess we beat the rush. 

And the three are off. Meanwhile, a familiar looking guard stands watch as he makes his rounds on the second floor, accompanied by his trusty partner.

Chris: Swag, what the hell are you doing? 

Swag pops out from behind a potted plant, binoculars in hand and everything as he scans for anything that may resemble a crime.

Swag: What does it look like I'm doing? I am fulfilling my sworn duty to the Mushroom Kingdom by keeping an eye out for any threats to this beloved mall and it's patrons! 

Chris: Does that REALLY warrant hiding in a bush and peeking around like a weirdo?

Swag: It's called being stealthy. The element of surprise can mean the difference between life and death. 

Chris isn't even surprised at this point. He would've just spared himself the trouble and just let this play out if not for the risk of some poor schmuck getting blown up with a rocket launcher. 

Chris: Swag....... I'm not saying you don't take your job seriously enough. You clearly do, and I respect that. That being said, this isn't an overseas deployment. We're in a God damn shopping mall. We're keeping an eye out for robbers, not hunting terrorists or busting gangs. Are you really gonna blow up a shoplifter for stealing some sandals? 

Swag opts not to answer that question, mainly because they both already know the answer. 

Chris: *sigh* Swag.

Swag: What?

Chris: Please don't blow up a shoplifter. 

Once again, his only reply is silence. 

Chris: SWAG, I SWEAR TO GOD- 

Rufus: Excuse me, um.......

The two snap their heads towards the jolly Australian man that just caught them screaming about blowing people up. Accompanying him is one of his friends from work, an Eliksni dawning a Mann Co. YLW cap and a name tag with the name ""Randal"" scribbled in High Speak. 

Chris: Oh! Don't mind us sir. We were just-

Swag: SHH! They still haven't seen me yet! 

Swag is once again hiding behind that potted plant in the hopes of evading detection. 

Chris: Um............ Anyways, is there anything I can help you with, sir? 

Rufus: We just wanted to know where to find the nearest sporting goods store.

Chris: Just make a right at the end of that walkway. You can't miss it. 

Rufus: Thanks, mate. 

The Eliksni chirps something along the lines of ""thank you"" as the two take their leave. Swag's head pops out from behind the tree the moment they're out of earshot. 

Swag: Holy balls, that was close. Anyways, you were saying? 

Chris: *long, exasperated sigh of annoyance* I need a coffee. 

As all of this is going down, Thad and Co have settled down at the local Grillby's for lunch. They aren't doing much else besides having a chat while they eat. Lizzy just has a milkshake, Doll has settled for a lemon-lime soda, and Thad is already halfway through his double barbecue bacon burger. 

Thad: Surprise surprise, two minutes later he's on the ground screaming ""AMBERLAMPS! AMBERLAMPS!"" to the top of his lungs. When he gets back from the hospital, the last thing he remembered was a faint nutmeg smell. 

Lizzy:  Wasn't that because he used cheese with BLACK MOLD on it?

Thad: That's what I said! So he thought he could use pepper spray to both kill the mold AND add a little spice. He couldn't taste anything for a WEEK after that.

Lizzy: I'm more surprised he's even alive.

Thad: Like I've been saying, the guy has IRL plot armor. 

Lizzy turns back to Doll, who's currently staring out to space again. It was like she was in a trance before Lizzy grabbed her attention. 

Lizzy: Hey. I wanted to say thanks for all this. Me and Thad both needed some space from all that crap in Bricktown. We promise we'll pay you back once we have a job that lasts more than a month. 

Doll just shrugs with a faint smile. It's not like she had any issue with covering for the trip. 

Thad: Yeah! Because that's what friends do. I know we don't really SAY it alot...... or at all..... but we can still feel it in our hearts, y'know? The friendship. Just the three of us having the time of our lives. 

Lizzy: Yeah, yeah. We all know. 

Thad: Right.

Once the bill has been paid, Doll gets up and flashes a peace sign to the other two before taking her leave to the bookstore. Thad is surprised to see Lizzy decide to go with Thad to the arcade.

Lizzy: Don't give me that look. You and I still have a score to settle on the track. 

Thad: I see. Best 3 out of 5 wins?

Lizzy: And the victor gets to decide where we go for dinner. I hope you still like sushi.

Thad: And I hope you're up for a little barbecue after I'm done ROASTING ya! 

Ah, petty rivalries. You love to see it. While our three amigos are off doing their thing, the evening sun is still beating down on the beach. A lifeguard watches a pair of Koopas playing some Volley Ball when she notices a shape on the horizon. She thought nothing of it at first, but a second look shows the object coming closer at an alarming rate. The life guard rises to her feet and brings out the megaphone upon realizing what's going on.

Lifeguard: EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WATER, NOW! 

Confusion gives way to panic as the crowd piles out of the water. Any slower and they would've been crushed beneath a metal hull violently running aground, churning up clouds of sand and seawater before its engine grinds to a halt. A crowd quickly gathers around the scene, and the Lifeguard calls in backup to secure the tugboat that stopped mere inches from her station.

Lifeguard: We have a boat run aground right in front of Paradise Mall. Please advise.

i've been living with my roommate for 11 months now. we met living in a different apartment and decided to move in just the two of us. we've been living in a 2 bed for almost 3 months now. we became friends thought living together and get along quite well. we are just as much friends as roommates.

here's the problem... she's a little too comfortable and takes liberties i'm not comfortable with. 

some examples:

* she drinks my diet cokes without asking and even shares them with friends.
* she ate part of a cake i brought back from dinner with my parents.
* she went into my room to go on the fire escape while i was away and didn't ask or tell me until days later. when i asked her the next weekend i was away not to go into my room, she still did and sat on the fire escape of my window with five of her friends. i also found dried pasta in my shoes and on my clothes?? which i still don't understand how that happened.
* she asked to share toothpaste, i said no. she used my toothpaste anyway but left her nearly empty tube in the bathroom to kinda make it seem she still had her own. i then agreed because i didn't see another way without a fight.

when we lived in a 5 man apartment i also had to set boundaries with her. she would take my speaker into her room and when i asked for it she would say no. i bought a cake for the whole house and we all had one piece then she finished the rest. i had a conversation with her about this 8 months ago and she apologized and got her own speaker. but now here we are again and i feel like i have no personal space.

i want to share things and have always been an amicable person, but i'm at the end of my rope. she also just comes into my room when i'm working. i was sick this week and she came into my room and sat on my bed while i was laying there with my eye's closed and she started watching a youtube video. she also consistently makes me feel guilty for leaving her at home. when i go away for a weekend she'll say, ""you're leaving me again?"" 

she's 23 and is living way from home for the first time (she's danish this is a normal age for them). but when she first got to NYC she would get upset that we all weren't waking up and having coffee and breakfast together like her family would. she also only leaves the house to go the class (part time) and doesn't go out on the weekend. she makes me feel responsible for her happiness (i'm 26 for reference and have taken on a 'big sister' role).

the problem is i'm at the point where i don't want to share anything because i feel like i give more than i get and i don't feel like i have any boundaries. i now feel like i don't know if she is going into my room when i'm not there (partially because she has now i don't know how much she does it).

how do i have this conversation but still have a comfortable open house? is it reasonable for me to tell her i don't want to share anything? how do i tell her i'm her friend but not her mother or family and i need space? her mom has told her she takes things and makes them her own and takes up too much space (which i know to be true. she took a pair of my shorts and just started wearing them even though i didn't say she could). i don't want to sound like her mom or trigger that but i'm one more stolen apple away from losing it.",0,1744178895.0,badroommates,0,0.5,False

I have switched from a full automatic system (Jura E80) to the The Sage Barista Touch. 

Beautiful machine but I struggle with it. 

First off, I bought this because I thought the pre-settings would be spot on when I want to make an espresso or a American or a flat white. This is definitely not the case for me. 

For example, making a single shot of espresso results in the following.

Grind setting to 14 (the recommended to start with that) give me way 2 much coffee so I can’t stamp it properly and making a complete mess. When I have removed the excess coffee and stamped it and want to brew, I get a espresso cup filled to the rim (2 much volume or ML). And the taste for me is between a espresso and Americano. 

Also with the milk drinks, they all are just saying heat milk to 65 degrees and there is no real difference between a latte or a flat what or anything. 

Is it me, or is the machine over-sold to me. If I need to fiddle with the settings I could have bought a cheaper machine without the display right? 

Any help in the right direction would be very appreciated.",1,1744178789.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

## ⁤A Head-to-Head Showdown: Bose QC⁢ vs Sony XM5

The Sony WH-1000XM5 vs ⁣Bose noise cancelling headphones debate is a long-standing​ one. Both brands‍ are renowned for their superior active noise cancellation ‌(ANC) and⁢ excellent sound⁢ quality,‍ but ‍nuanced differences can make all the difference⁢ depending⁢ on⁤ your⁣ priorities.Let’s break down the key aspects of these flagship headphones:

### Noise Cancellation Comparison: ⁣Silence is⁢ Golden

When it comes to noise cancellation comparison, both ⁣the Bose QuietComfort and the ⁤Sony ‍WH-1000XM5 deliver remarkable performance. They excel at blocking out a wide ​range of ambient ⁢sounds, from the low ⁤rumble of airplane engines to the chatter in⁤ a busy⁤ coffee shop. However, subtle differences exist.

Sony’s WH-1000XM5 frequently enough receives accolades for ​its ability ‍to aggressively attenuate low-frequency noise, making it a ​top choice for frequent travelers. ⁤The multi-microphone setup and advanced algorithms⁣ in the Sony XM5 allow it to ‌adapt to different environments more effectively.

Bose, ‌conversely,‌ has historically been‍ praised for its natural-sounding ⁤noise cancellation. The noise⁢ cancellation ‌feels less like a​ vacuum and more like a gentle muffling of the outside⁤ world. In some tests, the Bose quietcomfort may perform‍ slightly ⁣better at cancelling out mid-range frequencies, like human voices. This makes‍ them a strong contender for⁣ those working in shared office spaces ​or who simply want to minimize distractions at home.

ultimately, the​ best noise cancelling headphones​ for you will​ depend ⁣on ‍the⁣ specific‌ types‌ of ‍noise you're hoping ‌to eliminate.

### ​Sound Quality Comparison: Hear the Difference

Beyond just blocking out noise,‌ the‍ best ⁤headphones must deliver exceptional sound‌ quality. Both ‍the Bose QuietComfort and the⁤ Sony WH-1000XM5 aim to please even the most critical listeners.

Sony's WH-1000XM5 is⁢ known‍ for its balanced⁢ and detailed sound signature.‌ It delivers ​rich bass, ⁣clear mids, and crisp highs, making it⁣ well-suited for a‌ variety of musical ⁤genres. The‍ support for high-resolution audio codecs like LDAC ensures that you're getting‍ the most out of your digital music ‍library ‌when paired with a ⁤compatible device.many reviewers praise the sony xm5 ‍review sound reproduction fidelity.

Bose generally provides a more consumer kind⁢ approach to sound, ensuring a balance that favors no single genre. Bose's sound signature has typically been characterized by a slightly warmer, more relaxed sound. Some audiophiles may prefer the more neutral presentation of the Sony⁣ headphones, while others might find the Bose sound⁤ more enjoyable for casual listening.Consider your preferred listening style and the types of music you listen to most often when evaluating sound quality.

### Comfort and Fit: All-Day Wearability

Comfort and fit is critical especially for long flights ⁤or hours of work.⁤ Headphones‍ that‌ are‍ uncomfortable to wear can‍ quickly become‍ a source of ⁢frustration. Both the Bose QuietComfort ​and the Sony WH-1000XM5 are ⁢designed with comfort in mind, but their approaches ‍differ.‍ The⁤ earcup design is ‍noticeably⁤ different too.

The Bose QuietComfort line has been praised for its⁤ lightweight⁢ design and plush earcups. The⁤ gentle clamping ⁣force and well-padded headband make ‍these headphones ​comfortable to wear for extended‌ periods.

The Sony WH-1000XM5 has a slightly more substantial feel, and the earcup design ⁤fully encompasses the ear for some users which maximizes sound reduction.⁤ The headband is also well-padded. Comfort is a⁢ very subjective experience, so it’s always best ⁣to‌ try on both models⁢ if possible to see which feels better for you. Ensure the earcup⁣ cushions rest ​comfortably around your⁤ ears.

### Battery Life ⁤Comparison: Powering Your Listening

These models feature long lasting use, but knowing the battery life comparison is still crucial. In ‌this comparison the‍ number⁢ reflects how long the⁤ battery lasts while using⁣ the noise⁢ cancelling feature.

The Bose QuietComfort typically​ provides around⁢ 24 hours of battery⁢ life with ANC ‍on. While this is‌ less than the Sony, it is still sufficient for most users. A short 15-minute⁢ charge can provide up to ⁢3 hours of playback.

Consider how‌ often you'll ⁢be using your headphones and whether you'll ​have ⁢easy access⁣ to charging when‍ making your decision. For⁢ long haul‍ flights,the Sony XM5 boasts better mileage,though the‌ Bose quietcomfort option is enough for transatlantic travels.

I eat for dopamine, I mindlessly eat throughout the day because I’m stressed or bored. I actually don’t really care too much about eating junk food anymore. 

Anyways, I WFH which made me eat more since my kitchen is nearby. I realized that if I bring a bowl of raw cauliflower to my desk, I’ll start pecking on it. I don’t even love it, but it’s there. It prevents me from going to my fridge and grabbing something more calorie dense. 

Obviously cauliflower isn’t the yummiest treat. But lately I’ve bought packs of blackberries, strawberries or raspberries since they’re so low calorie. I eat them while watching tv. Bring the whole pack out. I make sure I savor each one. At the end of the day, when I do that, I’m not really adding that many calories to my diet. If you really want to make it a sweet treat add fat free Reddi Whip. 

Anyways, game changer to my weight loss journey. Snacking on berries veggies, low calorie sweet coffee from Sbux for breakfast and one meal gets replaced with tasty cabbage soup. It’s hard for me to go over 1200.

Watching the sun crawl up the land.

Frogs at night—I feel what they feel.

Insects buzzing like they believe.
I don’t need much, just this spot,
A chair, a view, the world forgot.  

Day rolls slow, from dawn to dark,
No rush, no noise, just a spark—
The trees, the sky, they talk to me,
A language I’m dying to set free.

A life where my soul don’t burn.

I've highlighted different areas so you can just read sections relevant to what you're attending. I'm also always happy to talk Vegas and can answer more specific questions.)  

Hi all. I'm a huge pro wrestling nerd and a Las Vegas geek. Although I don't follow WWE much anymore, Mania Week is still one of my favorite weeks of the year. With the amount of satellite shows and the greatest wrestlers from around the world descending on one city, it's Pro Wrestling Thanksgiving; everyone is there and there's going to be too much to consume. When WWE announced Mania coming to Vegas, I knew I was going to be there and cross a bucket list item off my list: spend 4 days consuming live pro wrestling from morning until late night. I've lost count of how many times I've visited Vegas. Hell, I lost count how many times I visited last year. I've stayed up and down The Strip, Downtown, and a couple of locals places. Yes, I play the slots enough that I have some status and get free rooms. I visit so often because my preferred choices of entertainment, big name concerts, wrestling shows, and sports events, don't happen at my home in Montana (also, I'd give anything for half decent dim sum here). But Vegas is a short flight and, despite recent changes, still relatively cheap for quick getaways. I get asked often for things to do and see, places to stay, what to eat, etc. So I thought I'd offer up some Mania week specific tips from a frequent Vegas visitor.

**Vegas Basics (you may have heard some of these:)**


**Shoes-**. Wear comfortable shoes that you've broken in. Ladies, think twice about the cute heels unless you're staying on/near your hotel. You will walk. A lot. ""Caesars Palace is right there!"" It's not, and it's huge when you get there. Keep your feet happy.

-**Distance**. Speaking of walking. Everything looks closer than it is. The WWE-centric stuff like WWE World at the Convention Center, isn't walkable to too many areas of touristy interest. Budget time to get where you need to be, whether walking, rideshare/taxi, or shuttling.

-**Buskers**. The Vegas Strip has become much like Times Square or Hollywood Blvd with the amount of buskers and street hustlers. Costumed characters, musicians, mariachi bands, shirtless buff dudes and groups of girls in showgirl outfits. They're not free. If you absolutely have to have your picture taken with any of them, negotiate a price up front before the pic is taken and the 2 showgirls are demanding $100 each.

""Monks"" will approach you and attempt to put a bracelet on you and then ask for a donation for the temple they're building. They're not munks, there is no temple. Completely ghost them.

I'm going to include timeshare people inside the hotels here. Mostly found in the cheaper properties such as Flamingo, Excalibur, Luxor, Harrah's, these people dress like hotel management and will approach you, especially if you're a couple, with lines like ""Have you got your free comps yet?"" They will offer, and give you, show tickets and dining vouchers. The price you pay is sitting through a ""90 minute"" (lol) timeshare presentation that turns into 4 hours and happens offsite. They drove you there and they're your ride back. And they've got your ""free"" show tickets held hostage. If you want to see Blue Man Group, just buy Blue Man Group tickets.

-**Porn Slappers**: Groups of people snapping playing card sized pictures of naked girls advertising direct to your room services. Unless you want to collect them all like Pokemon, don't even extend your hand out or you'll have all of them shove a handful at you. (If you do take a handful just for shits 'n giggles and recognize, by name, at least 3 of the girls on the card, you may want to curb the internet porn for a while. No, 2004 era Tera Patrick isn't available.)

(By the way, that ""$59 to your room"" is exactly that. A girl will show up to your room and collect $59 and then negotiate prices from there for everything from a strip show to....other things. You'll be lucky to see a calf, let alone anything else, for $59. Plus there's a big chance you're gonna get robbed. Don't do it. In fact, if you're in your YEET shirt and a beautiful, strange woman takes sudden interest in you, she ain't free.) Prostitution is illegal in Vegas.

-**Money**. You're going to spend it. Everything is more expensive and then you get fee'd to death. There are some islands of value, and the many Walgreens/CVS/ABC Stores are havens of decent value for drinks, water, snacks, alcohol, and any basics your forgot to pack. Watch out for things like ""venue fees"" or something similar tacked on to restaurant bills. Usually 3%-5% added on to the bill. You can ask for this to be removed and they don't put up much of a fuss. A party of 2-4 shouldn't be paying ""service fees."" Just some Vegas bullshit that's pissing regular visitors off.

-**Your Hotel**. This is probably too late but if you've booked some off Strip el cheapo hotel, you should reconsider and look into a low to mid priced Strip or Downtown property. Any money you save will be wasted to extra time, transportation expense, and possible frustration trying to get from an out-of-the-way hotel to the areas of interest and where the events are happening.

-**Airport Transportation**. Everyone hates cabs in favor of Uber/Lyft, but from the airport I find taking a taxi faster, more convenient, and depending on how many other travelers are also getting a rideshare, price comparable. Airport to Strip properties prices are set with no meter running, so you'll know your cost before getting in. There's signs around the pickup area. The taxi line is right outside the baggage claim doors and moves quickly even if there's a lot of people waiting. And with fixed pricing, they lost all incentive to long haul unknowing tourists. Bring cash to avoid the $3 card fee and give a nice tip if the driver made it pleasant. Also, the fixed pricing is good for trips to the airport, too, however Uber/Lyft are convenient and usually cheaper here since they can drop you at the terminal and your property has less of a chance for surge compared to airport pickup.

-**A Vegas Vacation**. Unless you're only going to the 2 nights of WrestleMania, I have to advise against trying to have a Vegas vacation while attending all the wrestling things. Even if you're only going to WWE hosted events, it's going to be a lot. Plan some extra days or come back some other time for ""Vegas, baby.""

I often hear ""2 days in Las Vegas is enough"" when anything less than 4 feels like I was barely there. Those people burn the candle at both ends (and there's nothing wrong with that, if that's your thing). Little to no sleep, all day binge drinking, maybe some substances. My advice: Sleep if you need to sleep. Enjoy your drink instead of pounding shots before 10am (and if you have to have one of those slushy drinks, get a smaller one). Plan for some relaxation times. Fit in some veggies in a couple of your meals. Do that and you'll be fine even if you're doing Wednesday-Tuesday with wrestling things from morning until midnight.

**The Venues**:

**Allegiant Stadium. History will be made!**

**Transportation**- Despite what I said above, Allegiant is surprisingly walkable from The Strip. I'm seeing round trip shuttle services for $66 or something and, depending on where you're coming from, that may not be necessary. The Hacienda Bridge will be closed to traffic hours before the event in preparation of foot traffic from The Strip. Get there just off the Mandalay Bay casino floor near the entrance to The Shoppes (the door is between the escalator and the sports bar). Getting to Mandalay Bay is easy from Luxor, Excalibur, New York New York, Park MGM, MGM Grand, Cosmopolitan, Vdara, and Bellagio via use of free trams and inner walkways, and the door to the walkway to the Stadium is really close to the exit of the tram at Mandalay Bay. And if you're further north but on the Monorail line, I'd consider taking that to MGM Grand, hoofing it over to outside Excalibur, tramming it to Mandalay Bay, and walking to Allegiant before paying for shuttles or rideshares. Free trams run from Bellagio (with Cosmopolitan and Vdara access) down to Aria/Park MGM with a stop at the Crystals bougie mall in between. There's also a tram from outside Excalibur to Mandalay Bay. It only stops at Luxor on the return trip from Mandalay Bay. Getting from Park MGM to the Excalibur tram stop is an easy walk through Park MGM and then through or around New York New York.

**The door-** There's one primary entrance almost everyone uses. It gets packed. Everyone piles into the nearest ones on the right, so move to the left to find some shorter lines.

**Stadium Amenities**- There's no shortage of food and drink options in Allegiant, including tourist favorites like Dirt Dog, Evel Pie, and Pinkbox donuts. I had a brisket burrito at BBQ Mexicana at the LSU vs USC football game last season that was amazing. Here's their food and bar options: https://visit.allegiantstadium.com/plan-your-visit/food-beverage-menu-guide  There's also an In-N-Out Burger on the opposite side of the main entrance. I've never been to that one but I imagine it gets pretty busy pre and post events. There's a few other places nearby as well.

If you're a Raiders fan, there's lots of Raiders photos and history on the main concourse.

**Food and Drink Prices**- I won't say it's cheap, however considering it's Vegas and a stadium that hosts NFL and major events, its...fine? I've never felt overly gouged by food/drink prices at Allegiant, like I needed to slowly sip my cocktail because it's the only one I'm buying. Bottles of water are actually cheaper than the prices in the hotel shops (you just have to drink it out of a Raider branded bottle).

**Merch**- WWE probably has their merch game more on point than most, however in the 1 football game and 2 concerts I've attended at Allegiant, there's been only giant merch stand and it's right inside the main doors. The line gets very long. I waited over an hour to get a Rolling Stones t-shirt. Now, I've only ever sat in the lower bowl area, so I don't know if there's smaller merch stands in the upper levels or down on the floor, but there's never been another one on the main concourse. I suggest getting the merch you want at WWE World or just ordering it. God forbid there's Mania exclusive merch only available at Allegiant. Get there early if merch is a must.

**Special Areas**- if you bought tickets in Sections 109-115, you're going to be in the Modelo Cantina Club. If you're in Sections 131-137, you're in the Twitch Lounge. I unknowingly bought a ticket here once and, oh my, it's the way to go. You go in a special entrance that opens up to an area with comfortable seating areas, bars, and multiple food options. And restrooms. These are only open to the sections listed, so you'll have shorter waits for concessions and a less crowded bathroom, as well as comfy seating areas if you need a break from the commotion.

**After Mania**- that walkway back to The Strip will be packed. In Vegas, the ushers don't give you any time to linger after the event and let the crowd clear out. You're not at a slot machine or overpriced lounge if you're just chilling in the stadium. All rideshares will be surge pricing. Those free trams and even the Monorail will be packed. I went to see Pink at Allegiant and walked to MGM Grand to catch the Monorail to Horseshoe, was the last sardine on the car, and even at Horseshoe had to wait for a few different elevators as other concert goers were heading up to their rooms, too. I highly recommend enduring the packed bridge back over, walking over to at least The Park (outdoor area between New York New York and Park MGM) and just chilling and talk about the show with your people, check online reactions, etc. Or just take a leisurely stroll to where you need to go. Or wait in a long taxi line or pay surge rideshare. For those of you paying for the shuttles, you're still going to be waiting a while to get on one and it'll have to deal with traffic leaving too. Be patient. 

**T-Mobile Arena. Go Knights Go!**


**Transportation**- T-Mobile is walkable from anywhere mid-Strip on south, especially if you make use of the free trams up from Mandalay Bay and down from Bellagio. If you're staying at Park MGM or New York New York, you can walk out the door and hit it with a tennis ball with a decent arm and only a couple of bounces. Again, if using the shuttle services, consider if you need to pay that price. A rideshare directly to the arena may trigger a surge, but one to New York New York or Aria might be cheaper and be a quick walk.

**The door**- the opposite of Allegiant Stadium. Everyone lines up behind the left doors. Walk over to the right and you'll find shorter lines to get in. If you're a T-Mobile subscriber, you'll find a door just for you over there.

**Arena Amenities**- Decent concession options, including a Shake Shack. https://www.t-mobilearena.com/arena-information/arena-dining

There's a bar/lounge area at the very top of T-Mobile on the east end. For Golden Knights game, this is a first come, first serve standing room only area open to anyone with a ticket. But I have no idea how it operates for something like WWE/NXT shows.

The Toshiba Plaza is the area outside the front doors. There will be bars set up, probably a merch stand or 2, and maybe some entertainment on the stage. Along with The Park leading up to the Arena, a great place to hang out before heading into T-Mobile.

**Concession Prices**- ugh. Over $20 cocktails. Way too much for a Bud Light tallboy. Plenty of great food options in the properties just outside the Arena. Eat before/after.

**Merch**- The main merch stand is right inside the doors, however there are multiple smaller merch stands on the concourses of all levels.

**Special Areas**- Sections 15 and 16 have access to the Bud Light Lounge. Sections 5 and 6 have access to the Ghost Lounge. Again, these are areas only available to those sections with multiple food and drink options and a restroom. As a bonus, I find those seats really nice for my large ass. And just like Allegiant, I didn't even realize I bought that section until I went to see Lady Gaga. Now, I always check if I can get one of those areas.

**After the show**- you're in the thick of the action. NYNY and Park MGM will be hopping, as will Aria, Cosmo, and Excalibur. Plenty of options to grab some food or a drink or just hang out after. If you're heading over to Palms for the late night Collective show, it's a quick rideshare or taxi ride from NYNY or Park MGM but traffic out might suck.

Now I have seen some comments here about going back to the room after NXT for a nap before Mania night 1 and....I don't know. If you're staying anywhere south of T-Mobile (NYNY, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay) or at Park MGM or Aria, this is possible. But if you have to take a ride back to your hotel, I think you're cutting it close. T-Mobile to Allegiant is walkable and you'll have plenty of time. I don't know, I guess I don't like to be in a rush and that's what I'd be if I had to go to a north property and then back the other way to Allegiant. If you're staying Downtown or anywhere off Strip other than Palms, Orleans, or Rio, forget it.

**Fontainebleau. You're staying at the Official WWE Hotel? You bougie motherfucker!**

Fontainebleau is the newest Strip property and, as of right now, the newest in all of Las Vegas. It is NICE. There's also not any cheap food or drink options on property. Even the food hall is not cheap. But it is pretty and the staff are great. Get a room facing south and you're likely to get a nice view down The Strip and of the Sphere. Rooms are very nice.

Washing Potato is great for dim sum and Chinese entrees. Mother Wolf is DELICIOUS Italian food (get the focaccia). If you like your steak with a side of Las Vegas night club, go to Papi Steak.

The main issue with Fontainebleau since the day it opened is that it isn't near anything. The North Strip is in the process of making a comeback but it's not there yet. It doesn't get a lot of foot traffic. For Mania Week purposes, it's a GREAT location for WWE World and, to a lessor extent, Wrestlecon at Westgate (10-15 minute walk), but it's not near most of things you think of when you think ""Vegas."" The Stratosphere tower looks close, but it's a bit of a hike. It is across the street from Circus Circus, which has cheaper food (including $2 hot dogs and beers at Slots-A-Fun) and some decent fun if you're bringing kiddos, including the Midway, Adventuredome, and the new Spongebob interactive ride thingy. There's also one of the surprisingly few Strip McDonald's across the street, as well as Resorts World not too far away, which has slightly cheaper and, in my opinion, better fast casual food options like Junior's and their Famous Food Food Hall, which has much better options than the Fontainebleau food hall (the Char Kuey Teow at Googleman may be my favorite dish in Las Vegas and you can get it and a beer for less than $30). 

I am morbidly curious how a wrestling crowd attending WWE events in LIV nightclub are going to mix with the normal crowd that shows up at LIV. I was personally fascinated sitting at a slot machine and noticing that, somehow, club girl's skirts have got even shorter than when that was my scene. Whole butt out and everything. Just remember, take your advice from the Bella's theme song, you can look but you can't touch.

**The Palms. Home of The Collective.**

I really like The Palms. This is going to be a great place for those of us who are going to a lot of the shows being hosted by GCW. Rooms are pretty basic but well appointed, clean, and comfortable. I think Palms has the cheapest mini bar prices I've seen in Vegas, although I'd still recommend staying away from the ""no-no bar.""

**The Pearl** is a great venue. TNA has had shows there before and they were great. Some of The Collective shows look like the tickets are slow moving, so I'm curious what it'll be like if it's a small crowd. Merch area? Sucks. Small and cramped. Hoping GCW has a bigger area set up, possibly just outside the venue.

Palms has some great food options, including some quick options for between shows. The food court has a McD's, Panda Express, Coffee Bean, and Earl of Sandwich, all with prices not much more than you'd get at the ones in your hometown. The McD's is 24 hours. I don't have an Earl of Sandwich near me so I always go there and a nice sized sandwich is $10 (the holiday turkey sandwich, my GOD, it's amazing). The noodle place, Send Noods, is good. Tim Ho Wan is good dim sum. Mabel's BBQ is okay. Big portions. A bit too pricey because it's a Michael Symon restaurant. The A.Y.C.E buffet has all you can eat whole lobster and crab on Wednesday and Thursday for $80 starting at 3pm. It's popular and the line is long. Prime Rib and crab on Friday night is $53. Brunch starts at 9am each day if you want to stuff your face before the 11am show.

Palms is off Strip but not way off Strip. Rideshares and taxis usually aren't too bad, especially if you're going to somewhere center Strip.

**UNLV Cox Pavilion- Cross The Line**

TNA is at the home of the Runnin' Rebels. I've only been there twice, once for a women's basketball game on Black Friday attended by less than 100 people, the other being a MC Hammer/Tone Loc/Young MC concert. That was fun. Not too far off Strip. Quick and not expensive Uber/Lyft over there. No frills venue. Basic college campus basketball arena concessions. Soda, popcorn, hot dogs, etc. Alcohol is served. 'Tis Vegas, after all.

**Downtown- Multiple Venues**

**Meet, The Nerd, Fremont Country Club, etc**, hosting Prestige, West Coast Pro, Stardom, Pandemonium, Pride Style, New Texas and lots others. All of these are near, but not actually at, the Fremont Street Experience, the big LED canopy. These are all small venues but will be perfect for the shows they're hosting (maybe except Stardom, seems like demand is there for a larger space). The vibe of these shows may be the best of the week because Downtown is such an amazing place. Besides the Fremont Street Experience, there's Fremont East, packed with bars and places to eat. There's a pro wrestling bar, DDT. El Cortez is nearby, which is old school Vegas. They've recently spend some money to add a whole new area with new bars, gaming space, and the new noodle place Hot Noods (what's with noodle restaurants and double entendre names?) Downtown is going to be the place to be late night Thursday and Friday. There's even a show at Container Park, which should be cool and is worth checking out even if you're not going to the show there.

**FSW Arena- So you're going to a show here?**

There's a lot of shows happening here, including a WWE ID tournament show. What can I say? In the most loving way I can say, it's a dump. Dumps can be great for indie wrestling but they're still dumps. There's no air conditioning, so if it's hot outside, it's hot in there. There is no space in there. There's barely space for fans. Merch? Never seen it. Concessions? I think they were selling those small bags of chips you can get a case of at Walmart once. Bring a filled water bottle if you want something to drink. There is nothing nearby to walk and grab some food or a drink. When you're getting your Lyft or taxi there, you may think they're taking you somewhere to steal your kidney. Your driver is probably wondering why a Strip tourist is wanting to go to some warehouse. That's what it is. A big commercial warehouse complex. One of them happens to be a wrestling school and the home of Vegas' local promotion, Future Stars of Wrestling. But that place has produced Solo Sikoa, Chris Bey, Karrion Kross, and others, so what do I know? I'm shit talking but it's fun. But it is the indiest of indie venues of Mania week.

**Silverton- Really, Stardom?**

The Thursday Stardom and Spark Joshi show are out at Silverton, a locals casino. In the grand scheme of things, it's not too far from The Strip, but it is a bit out of the way. Going to be a pricier ride there and back. And those are the shows you're seeing that day. Most everything else is off the table or you'll get there late because the start times don't sync up with other events.

I've never been to Silverton. I think there's a Bass Pro Shops there. There's an aquarium that has mermaids in it. I'm sure the food options are decent and cheaper than The Strip or Downtown. 

This location means I'm missing Stardom this Mania week. Silverton is too out of the way for Thursday and the Friday show Downtown is the most expensive non-WWE, non-full Collective ticket of Mania week.

**The Convention Center- WWE World**

Never been inside here either. It's HUGE. And looks really nice on the outside. If you're trying to get here from south or mid Strip, a good option is to take the Monorail to the Westgate stop. The Westgate has a Boring Company underground Tesla tunnel that has 2 different stops at the Convention Center (and also Resorts World, but that's it for now). It's Vegas' shitty, non-convenient solution to public transportation. Underground trains? Naw, Teslas. 

There is a great place for breakfast and lunch near the Convention Center. Siegel's Bagelmania. Fresh bagels that they can make breakfast sandwiches or pastrami, corned beef, or brisket at lunch. There's also a Pinkbox donuts inside for amazing, large donuts.

**Westgate- Home of Wrestlecon**

Another place I'm not that familiar with due to it's out of the way location. I know the sports book is legendary, as are the themed suites you can stay in. Westgate, under a different name, was the Vegas home for Elvis, and there's some Elvis stuff around. Westgate was also the long time home of Star Trek: The Experience. It closed long ago, however some of the theming is still there in their timeshare area if you want to see it. 

**The Westgate Monorail stop** is convenient if you're staying south/center Strip and want to get to Wrestlecon, WWE World, or any of the WWE Events/Hall of Fame at Fontainebleau, which is a quick 10-15 minute walk from the Monorail stop.

**The Cosmopolitan- Wrestling Observer Convention**

Old Big Dave, Alverez, or whomever planned this picked the gem of the Strip. I LOVE Cosmo. Great eats, including Block 16 Food Hall with Hattie B's Hot Chicken, Lardo, and District Donuts, Sliders, Brew, which has one of the best bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits I've ever had. China Poblano, a Mexican/Chinese fusion, is also good. And The Henry is great for late night and breakfast, opening at 10pm and closing at 2pm. Can you find Ghost Donkey or the Ski Lodge? Is the old school barber shop really just a barber shop? The centerpiece bar, The Chandelier, has the ONE cocktail I recommend everyone try once: an off menu drink called The Verbena. It has the ""buzz button,"" a flower that will numb up your mouth and tongue, giving the drink different flavor profiles each time you sip. 

The Cosmo casino is almost always a vibe. High energy. Most of the rooms have a balcony so you can sit outside. If you get a fountain view, you may never leave the room.

Yeah, great place to hang out with Uncle Dave.

**Must Do's in Vegas:**


I know I said don't try to fit in a Vegas vacation with your wrestling trip, but if it is your first time in Vegas, try to do a couple of things in addition to the graps:

**The Bellagio Conservatory-** everyone knows about the Fountains out front and they're spectacular. The sidewalk on The Strip can get crowded, especially with all the buskers and mariachi bands. There's a sidewalk that wraps around the lake leading into Bellagio, a viewing area just off Bellagio's porte-cochere, or an elevated walkway from the Strip to Bellagio just to the south that are better viewing spots, which have speakers to hear the music the water is synced to.

Less people seem to know about The Conservatory. Just inside Bellagio past the front desk lobby, it is a large atrium with seasonally changing displays made of plants and flowers. It's so beautiful and, if not overly crowded, serene. I find the best time to go there is between 1am to 7am. Lucky for you, with all the wrestling things, this will be the time you have available to go!

**Venetian/Palazzo Grand Canal Shoppes**- 

Just really cool. Take a walk through. They got rid of the street performers, unfortunately.

**The Sphere**-  Probably no time to take in any of the concerts/shows there, but if you've never seen it in person, just watching it can be mesmerizing. The pedestrian bridge between Palazzo and Wynn has become known as The Sphere Bridge. It has an amazing view of Sphere, especially nearer the Wynn side of the bridge. For a better, but less popular view, take the escalator down on the Wynn side, make a U turn, and walk up the sidewalk a bit for a stunning full view of Sphere without a plexiglass panel to look through. If you want to walk right up to it, take the escalator down on the Palazzo side, make a U turn, and take a 10-15 minute walk past the Venetian Expo Convention Center and walk right up to Sphere.

Okay, this was a lot longer than I intended. But I love Vegas and wanted to share some of the things I've learned over the years to my fellow wrestling fans. There's a couple of subreddit's, /r/vegas and /r/LasVegas, that have FAQ's for general info. If you have questions or want specific recommendations for where you're staying, please don't hesitate to reach out. I love talking Vegas.",4,1744177518.0,SquaredCircle,4,0.63,False

I have read if we are giving it as a gift, free of cost & it's not performance-based, then we cannot claim the GST input.

Subject: Emotional Damage through Unexpected Third-Party Entry.
Platform: Not Tinder, not Instagram… but real life.

It all started so well…
She smiled.
You smiled.
She liked chai. You said, “Chai is better than coffee.”
She said, “I love long walks.” You started walking 3 km daily (even though your house is next to the bus stop).

Slowly, things were building up.
Good morning texts.
Late night talks.
Spotify playlists shared.

You thought: “Bas ab toh fix hai. Shaadi ke liye band bajwa do.”

BUT… then came the twist in the love story.

Enter: Her “Best Friend” 🥲
She says: “He’s just my best friend yaar.”
You hear: “He’s the final boss you must defeat to win me.”

Suddenly:

She’s busy on weekends (picnics with ‘best friend’).

You send long messages. She replies: “LOL 😂”

She forgets your birthday. But best friend got cake and guitar.

And you? You're sitting with chai and shattered dreams.

Business Analogy: The Market Crash 📉
Imagine investing all your time, emotions, good morning texts, and data pack on one startup (her),
And then one already funded unicorn (the best friend) comes in and takes over the market.

That’s not love, boss. That’s hostile acquisition.

Emotional ROI? ZERO.
Effort? MAXIMUM.
Heartbreak? Delivered.
Status? “It’s complicated.”
Google search: “Can I sue someone for being her best friend?”

So What’s the Takeaway?
Just like in startups, in love also:

Never ignore competition.

Do market research (scan her Instagram).

Beware of silent stakeholders (a.k.a. best friends).

And most importantly — diversify your emotional investments.

Final Thought:
Love is beautiful.
But when her best friend enters,
It becomes an unpaid internship.

1juyfc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LoveCrispApples/comments/1juyfc6/better_late_than_never/,Better late than never.,"2 weeks ago, my ex-wife's AP's ex called me up out of the blue. Turns out we have a mutual acquaintance I wasn't aware of that finally grew a set and stepped up to talk to her. Now, for context, both our divorces were finalized 5 months ago. She was separated 2 months before my wife left me.

She had a piece or two to the whole nasty puzzle that I needed, and I had a couple of my own for her. Separately, we were pretty much following the same timeline we were imagining/dreading (which, naturally, differs GREATLY from the timeline our spouses were building) and were able to learn the truth together.

We both thought a great deal last summer about making a more concerted effort to get in touch with the other, but neither of us did for various reasons- and we both regret not doing so. At the time, we both decided against calling HR on the cheating co-workers...

Now that they are exposed, and know we are in communication, our exes are acting accordingly, rekindling the whole victimhood book of lies they were spinning last year, but only now they look utterly stupid doing it. No accountability from either of them, but their shame and true selves are shining through. It's interesting to watch.

I had a few choice words with AP, which left him meek and cowardly, and the text battle between the women? EPIC. Both disgusting infidels deserved every word they got from us. More is coming, but then we'll simultaneously go silent. For good; for our own individual mental health and for our own lasting recoveries.

A couple families of 4 sustained a ton of heartache in this grueling process. Nobody deserves to live a lie, and we did, sadly, with no say in the matter. In the end, we both trusted our gut and were proven right. Her call to me was long overdue and opened a few wounds, but I'm glad it happened. Vindication is sweet, even though the result doesn't change.

As we know, closure comes from within, but it sure helps to find an unlikely ally.

Oh, in case anyone is interested, a couple betrayed and partially broken ex spouses have discussed the idea of grabbing a coffee, and as she put it, ""swap some spit, and maybe more."" Will we? Maybe. Maybe not. But the thought that it could is driving the 2 dirtbags slightly mad.

If it doesn't?  Well, that would mean I have roughly 24 hours to put something together.  What I could use is suggestions for something, anything really, that could be used for an outfit of any sort.  I don't care if it's canon or a coffee shop AU image.  Anything that has Yasha vibes is welcome.

i’m actually his barber now lol. 

anyways, we started to hang out and he would invite me out to the mall, out of town events, lunch, coffee, etc. even would call me randomly just to hang out for 30 min before he had to go into work. 

it got the point where we would talk every day. 
i had slowly started to like him the more we hung out and i wouldn’t mind doing it more. but he brings up that his good friend thinks im attractive. 

i met the friend, we’ll call him J. i met J in a group setting and my friend helps J with getting my number and my socials. he begins to wingman him. J then starts to text me and so on, me constantly leaving him hanging. i start to get confused and eventually a couple weeks later i ask my friend straight up if he was into me. 

he replies with quote for quote: “i think you’re such a cool girl and i love hanging out bc ur energy definitely matches mine. but i’d be an idiot jumping into something with u after just getting out of a relationship. if i overstepped please lmk”

i took it as a no. i swallowed my pride and decided to not share my feelings for him. we remained friends but he still behaves the same way from before. before this post, we had grabbed tacos together and he proceeded to give me his jacket bc of how cold i was.

1juybz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1juybz8/varenicline_experience_bong_smoker/,Varenicline Experience - bong smoker,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my experience so far with Varenicline (Chantix/Champix) on my quitting journey for nicotine filled bongs (aka poppers/mole/mook/chops/etc) 

I was a popper smoker for 12-13 years, daily, at least 5-10 time a day; there were gaps where I’d go somewhere for a night or two without, and some days where I’d smoke waaaay more. My average was 2.5 smokes a day, weed always ranged (depending on its %/intensity) but average was about 0.75g of weed a day. 

I recently found out that my cholesterol is extremely high and im considered very underweight for my age (34) - long story short I was told I must quit smoking to aid my overall health or it would drastically get worse.. quick. 

I tried three different times over the course of a year (April 2024-Now) to quit cold turkey (nicotine/bong) to no avail. I continued to smoke weed from a pipe but felt it did nothing. I was also tapering down the overall percentage of the weed (going from store bought 22-25+% to home grown garden backyard stuff). 
Without the bong, I always found my brain would go into overdrive; I’d crave the brain fog really. I couldn’t figure out what to do with myself. It’s like my poppers became a part of my personality. With my last attempt cold turkey (nicotine), I lasted four days before I felt this incredible rage/sadness take over and realized I needed more help. I bought another pack and made a doctors appointment for the next day. 

Talking to my doctor, he said because of my consumption (bong and less than 5 smokes a day) he believed NRT would do me over and I’d become more addicted to that (Picture consuming a small amount of nicotine a day but then trying to replace that with more) and have a harder time quitting the nicotine. When we discussed the weed smoking, I was honest and told him I didn’t even enjoy smoking it on its own without my bong/nic mixed in.. it didn’t “hit” me the same anymore and felt so much less enjoyable. From there he suggested Apo-Varenicline (Champix/Chantix) on the 14 week program. I do have major history of mental health problems (including being on Form1), diagnosed with dysautonomia, among other health issues. We had a super in depth conversation about all of that and what potential risks are and decided the lowest dose to start for a longer period of time would be best. He even added it may help with the weed consumption but no guarantee and to watch my anxiety/stress/consumption levels of weed all together while taking it. I was so surprised at how easy and safe I felt with that conversation. 

When picking up the prescription I was told to cease my smoking by day 8. I had told myself my quit day would be day 6, so then felt some ease of anxiousness thinking I had an extra two days to smoke if I wanted to. 

I am currently on day three and I’ve never felt so… good?! 
Day one was a bit of a wild ride - I felt it hit my body within the hour of taking it. I had horrible stomach pains and nausea all day, extreme disorientation (I put milk in my cupboard and cereal in the fridge), extreme hot and cold flashes and some pretty angry mood swings. BUT I only smoked twice. I literally had no desire to smoke almost instantly. Not even the fav morning rip after coffee to get the day started. 
Day two was more mellow - still with the same nausea but I expected it so it was easier to manage. Less brain fog but it was still there. No rage or anger swings but damn was I ever tired. I smoked three times and the last rip before bed I almost GAGGED at the taste. It was the last of the weed I had so figured that may be it? (Since it was outdoor homegrown). I spit everywhere afterwards because of how nasty it tasted. When getting into bed I started to feel absolutely horrible.. I believe I had an insane anxiety/panic attack.. I had heart flutters, insane headache, panic mindset and overall intense body yuck. (I could tell it wasn’t my dysautonomia due to symptoms/feelings). It eventually passed after about an hour and I fell right to sleep, having my first set of vivid dreams. They were so realistic it’s kinda blown my mind.. 
Day three I woke up and had absolutely no desire to feel that way again and have gone all day without smoking, nicotine OR weed. I gave my pack to my partner and have only thought about it maybe twice all day. I did go to our local weed shop and bought some low dose edibles for those “just in case” feelings; but I knew walking in I didn’t want leaf to smoke in my pipe. I’ve had some pretty gross stomach pains/horrible gas/trouble eating but I know that’s all to do with the withdrawals/body working its way back to what it was before smoking regularly. 

I believe whole heartedly because of smoking weed with nicotine the entire time, I became addicted to the nicotine in the bong… not the weed. I barely smoked any weed, it was almost ALL nicotine by the end of it. Quitting the nicotine with this medication has so far helped me quit weed as well. It’s as if because I don’t have that experience/head rush from the bong, I don’t want anything else because it doesn’t compare? I’m really not sure how to explain it. But I’m also feeling like I should have done this years ago.. I can’t believe how great I’ve felt today. 

As I said, I am only on day three but I’m really excited to see where this all goes and how I hold out.. reading horror stories about this medication I was so entirely hesitant (I actually asked for Wellbutrin at first) and whole heartedly wish everyone who takes/took this feels/felt the same.. because a week ago I would have told you I was close to just getting whatever sickness was coming and would have smoked the rest of my life away. 

Just always remember you know your body best. It may take time to quit… but you CAN make it happen <3 with or without help.

For more stubborn stains, you can try using a specialized fabric cleaner specifically designed for luggage. Be sure to allow the bag to air dry entirely before storing it.

Hey there, mystery human,

If you've made it this far into the post, first of all—congrats on your attention span. That’s rare these days and already a green flag. Second—maybe you're like me: tired of surface-level chats, ghostings after a good convo, and the weird limbo between “hey” and “do you want kids?”

So I figured I’d throw myself out there and write something actually real. No frills. No filters. Just me, looking to connect with someone who’s also craving something genuine, whether it starts with memes, music recs, or midnight oversharing.

About Me (aka: Who’s This Guy?)

29 | Based in Europe | Functioning Adult™
I work with people (sometimes the tiny kind, sometimes the chaotic kind) and it’s a job that’s taught me empathy, patience, and how to survive on zero sleep and too much coffee.

I’m an introvert by nature but warm up fast. Once I feel comfortable, I go from quiet thinker to “here’s a playlist I made that accidentally tells you too much about me.”

Here’s what keeps me going:

Music – My playlists go from soft indie ballads to aggressive boss battle themes and then back to lo-fi in under 3 tracks.

Movies – I’ll happily dissect a masterpiece or watch the worst rom-com on Netflix just for fun. Bonus points if you can quote bad dialogue with a straight face.

Gaming – I lean toward story-rich single-player adventures, but if you want to team up for something chaotic and hilarious, I’m in.

Books & Writing – I love getting lost in good fiction or oddly specific Wikipedia holes. I write when I can, even if it’s mostly half-finished Google Docs for now.

Creative things – Drawing, brainstorming, daydreaming. I'm in my “figure-it-out” era and loving the process.

Curiosity – I will absolutely watch a 40-minute video essay on a topic I’ll forget by next week—but I’ll be very passionate about it in the moment.



---

Who I’m Hoping to Meet:

I don’t have a long list or a rigid “type.” Honestly, I just want to talk to someone kind, curious, and open-minded—someone who wants to connect beyond “wyd.”

Bonus points if:

You enjoy silly, deep, or totally random conversations (or all three in one sitting).

You’re a fan of movie nights, music swaps, or virtual hangouts.

You can handle sarcasm, witty banter, and occasional existential spirals at ungodly hours.

You’re open to a relationship if the vibe’s right, and maybe even the idea of a family someday (no rush, no pressure—just openness).

You’re cool with exchanging pics when it feels natural, not weird.

You’re down to move to another chat platform if Reddit starts feeling like a weird third wheel.



---

Why Message Me?

Because you’re tired of talking to bots, dry texters, or people who vanish mid-convo.
Because you want someone who actually reads your replies.
Because you want to connect with someone who listens, laughs, and is willing to see where things go.
Because you're secretly a cat in human form. Or you just like cats. That works too.

At the very least, we might have a fun, thoughtful chat. At best? Well... let’s not spoil the ending just yet.

Shoot your shot—I'm friendly, I reply, and I promise to bring good vibes (and probably a meme or two).

I finally got a chance to try Slodoco and was pleasantly surprised by how good and fresh the donuts were. They’re easily the best donuts anywhere in the Santa Barbara area—which isn’t saying much, but it was still enough to get me excited. They do the standards very well, have some interesting creations and importantly, are not overly expensive. 

The 90s coffee shop vibe is cool too. If I didn’t have a carload of Costco goods I probably would have stayed a while a read a book and ordered too many donuts.

So I’ve been on a prescribed dose of bromazepam (3mg in the morning, 3mg at night) for trauma-based + inherited generalized anxiety disorder that makes basic life stuff—like leaving the house or holding down a routine—weirdly hard. The bromazepam helps a lot, but I also have pretty pronounced ADHD, which makes things like reading a book, watching a show, or even doing stuff I love (like guitaring, boxing, or training my dog) feel like climbing a mental Everest. My brain’s just too loud or zoned out.

Coffee weirdly helps with that focus boost, and after checking with my doc, I’m okay to have 3–4 cups a day—as long as I cut it off by 5pm to keep my sleep clean.

For context, I am a 35 yr old F, about 157 cm in height (5 feet 2 inches). Prior to Ozempic, I’ve always been quite small, weighing about 54-55 kgs (so about 119 lbs).

That’s all changed ever since I got pregnant with two kids (three pregnancies if you count my miscarriage in between).

My pregnancies have messed up my hormones, insulin, and thyroid pretty badly, causing me to gain more than 20kgs over the course of my pregnancy journeys. 

Started on Ozempic last year in Sept when I was at my heaviest after I stopped breastfeeding my second child and having my physician put me on it has been the best decision we’ve made so far. 

It’s leveled my blood sugar level, and helped with my appetite management really well. 

For context, I don’t cut out any food groups from my diet. I just manage my portions very well and have stopped drinking my calories completely (I stick to black coffee and Coke Zero when I need a caffeine hit)

I also exercise very regularly. Intense cardio through tennis 3x a week (we do drills and rallies) and recreational padel 2-3x a week. 

As a result, my weight has gone down back to pre pregnancy weight! Being on Oz has also helped me cut down my alcohol intake by a lot! 

I’m still on the 1.0 mg shot per week, so I’m not sure if I should still continue this or start tapering off to a lower dose given I’ve reached my goal weight.

Anyone out here stopped taking the medication after you reach your goal? If so, were you still able to maintain your goal weight?

**I'm gonna ask the woman at the store next door out on Monday and I'm nervous for the first time since I was a teenager.**



I work IT for a few stores in the area. Next to my main office is a Bath and Body Works and the most beautiful woman I've ever met works there. I went in for the first time a few weeks ago to get my mom a gift and the woman that helped me find stuff for her was gorgeous. My knees almost buckled when we accidentally made arm to arm contact moving through the store. I don't know if it was her enchanting me or sensory overload from all the candles and lotion. Probably a bit of both.

We've run into each other a few times since then and made small talk outside. She's so easy to talk to and funny. Her laugh makes me wish I were funnier so I could hear it more. Like music to my ears.

Could be hopeful thinking, but I get the feeling she might be into me too. So on Monday I'm planning on stopping by and asking if she'd like to go out for coffee or something. I haven't been this nervous asking someone out since I was in high school over a decade ago.

I won't be asking her out while she's working. Just putting this here because it's almost every comment I am getting at this point.



**Comments**



**TheThirdStrike**

*Best of luck. Just remember, the worst that can happen is she says no, and you go on with your day.*

>OOP: I've had my fair share of rejections. A no would suck, but I'd survive. I'm hoping that my read on her is accurate and I have a shot though.



**Tanedra**

*I highly recommend making your pitch and then giving her your phone number and leaving, rather than putting her on the spot to give a response in the moment. She's there to work, not to get hit on, and being in customer service where you're required to be nice to people can make things complicated. I'm not saying she won't be interested, and I'm rooting for you, but this would make her more comfortable.*

>OOP: She won't be at work when I ask her out. Most of our interactions have been after her or both of us were off the clock.



**Spoonbills**

*Learning how to take a “no” graciously is a useful life skill.*

>OOP: Got plenty of practice in high school and college. No worries there my friend.

*How much have you spoken to her? Have you even asked her if she has a family? What she does with her free time? Just because a woman hasn't got a ring on it doesn't mean she hasn't got someone. I've been engaged for six years and barely wear my engagement ring. Women who work in shops already have to deal with a lot of men hitting on them. Mainly because they're at work and are being friendly because they are in customer service mode. At least you're not asking her at work, but please check she's single if you haven't already before asking.*

>OOP: Honest question. Did I describe these interactions in a way that makes me sound like some creep following a poor woman around because she was nice to me once in a shop? I just wanted to get this off my chest because I'm a bit nervous about asking her out, but this comment (and a few others like it) are really depressing.

>And to somewhat answer your questions. I know a bit about her family in the area and we've shared some of what we do in our free time together. None of that involved her mentioning a significant other of any kind. She has initiated these interactions each time.



**Update - 3 days later**



I posted here to shake off my nerves about asking someone out that works next door to where I work. Yesterday I planned on asking her out to coffee. Got busy and it slipped my mind though. Luckily she stopped by to talk anyway.

I was loading up the company van yesterday for today's tickets when she came over to chat while I worked. Mostly small talk while I loaded boxes and did my paperwork. She was on her way to her car to head home when she stopped by so before she left I asked if she'd be interested in grabbing coffee sometime and she countered with an offer to go try out the ice cream place down the road when I was done for the day.

She came back when my shift was over and we met for milkshakes and sat around talking for a good while. I was nervous at first, but she's remarkably easy to talk to. We talked about our families, hobbies, jobs, and had a rather passionate debate on the best trails to walk in the area. So I proposed an outing this weekend to get our steps in and figure out who is right. Numbers have been shared and even though she's off today and I don't get to see her we've been texting a bit.

Pretty boring update I'm sure, but that's it.

*milkshakes > coffee, this gal is winning*



**BodaciousVermin**

*Boring update? Nah. This is all good and normal. You offered a future coffee, and she countered with an immediate ice cream. Then it became a shake and long convo, with a follow-up long duration hike. You got this. Have fun.*

1juy0k5,https://i.redd.it/o5olwc93sqte1.jpeg,Savorworks Colombia Geisha,"I enjoyed the Savoworks Colombia N°5 Geisha Spirit, a premium single-origin coffee from the Bella Alejandria estate (1,890 MASL), processed via the semi-washed anaerobic method. Brewed with a pour-over method using a medium-fine grind and a 1:16 coffee-to-water ratio, it delivered an exceptional experience.

The aroma was enchanting, featuring vibrant gardenia, zesty orange peel, refreshing lemongrass, and creamy milkweed notes that intensified during brewing. The taste was a revelation—floral and citrusy with a silky texture, zesty freshness from lemongrass, and an exotic kaffir finish, all enhanced by the medium-light roast. The mouthfeel was smooth with a balanced medium body, and the long, sweet finish made it a joy to savor.

I loved the aroma and taste, rating it 9/10—perfect for pour-over fans, though I’m curious about other brewing methods. ",8,1744175112.0,IndiaCoffee,9,0.83,False

The police pulled up in a truck and very aggressively demanded we show them are ID's. We we're literally just walking down the street to get a coffee. My brother initially refused because the police were very aggressive and said we have to show them, but we complied and they took all our info. After 15 mins and a big scene, they let us go. What is the world coming to these days? I get it, we look like outsiders, but we did nothing wrong. Maybe we look different but that's no way to treat people, especially paying tourists. 

I've read similar stories about this happening in the U.S. to foreigners and figure maybe it's related to all the extreme global conflict. Regardless, it was definitely harassment. Don't they have anything better to do or did they just want to get off on harassing foreigners? I also wonder if it's even legal for the police to stop you and demand you show them your ID (even if they DON'T suspect you of committing a crime) just because they are nosey and want to know who you are in ""there"" town. 

Btw we've been here a long time and traveled throughout the country without any issues. I figured a beach town would be relaxed and people would be chill, but my God, who would want to spend money or time in a place where police behave like this? I can't even imagine what would happen if my brother didn't show them his ID, but surely they would have taken him in. All for what? Walking down a street? Talk about racism and harassment. I guess the cops do the same here as they do in America, except there I know you can refuse to show them your ID if you're not suspected in doing anything wrong. What a joke.

I’d really love to meet other Nepali around 20–25 who are also looking for genuine friendships, like the kind where you support each other through life, celebrate small wins, have real conversations, laugh a lot, and slowly build a circle that feels like family.

I enjoy going out for coffee, exploring the city, late-night talks, cracking jokes, sharing food, and all the little things that make life feel warm. If you’re someone who’s looking for long-term connections, not just surface-level hangouts, I’d truly love to meet you.

1juxtuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1juxtuq/red_flags/,Red flags?,"I (20f) started seeing this guy (28) on March 18th, so it’s been a couple weeks now. We had a lovely first date and have been seeing each other pretty frequently since, going on walks, getting coffee, watching shows, getting dinner. He’s so sweet, he bought me and my sick grandmother (who I live with) flowers, he brings us drinks (orange juice, soda, vitamin water) almost every time he comes over, pays for everything, opens car doors for me and carries me over puddles. 

BUT I have a few potential concerns. None are overtly concerning on their own, but when you stick em all together I feel more than a little strange about it. 

The first and biggest one: exes. This man talks about his exes a lot. And somehow, all of them seem to be “crazy”. Now, I’m not stupid. And I know women, okay? I noticed this immediately, and have been keeping my eye on it. He told me one of his exes sexually assaulted him and then said he did it to her, broke up with him over a beer (alleged alcoholic) and lied about being pregnant to get him back. I’ve had some shitty relationships, so I can understand that some people really are just wild like that, but I don’t believe in coincidences. Then he tells me about the next ex when I ask about a picture of a little girl in his room. His ex’s daughter. Who apparently, was ripped out of his arms right after she called him dada for the first time by his ex. But the point is, he’s referred to various different women as crazy.

Cool. Cool cool cool. 

AND THEN he tells me today that he’s had six stalkers. Six. Six. Separate. “Stalkers”. That he woke up one day to one sitting in his room, staring at his bed. And that he befriended another one. And more, but to be honest I started kinda tuning it out a little. It sounded like a load of horse shit. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, because he really is a very respectful and kind man, but like…hmmm. You know? It’s not like he has a reason to lie. I just…SIX STALKERS?!

He’s thoughtful and observant and I very heavily suspect undiagnosed autism, which isn’t a bad thing, and I mention it only because I feel like…I maybe excuse some of the things he says. He has very…strange timing with some of his comments. Like he catches me off guard. We’ll be watching a show together cuddled up and he says something like, “so, I’ll have to show you how to take a bra off as quick as I do…” I’m paraphrasing but you get the point. But he also says things like, “earlier today i pulled an eyelash out of my eye that had grown through my eyelid-“ I feel like you can see where I’m like…okay. He doesn’t exactly have the best social skills. Maybe he’s just blabbing about his exes because he doesn’t realize that it’s kind of rude. 

He also asked me to be his girlfriend already. I turned him down and said not yet. Because I had previously told him I wanted to take things slow, and a week later, he pops the question. 

He does usually listen to me though, and I excused it as him being excited, but I just…don’t know. 

I don’t know. But I’ve been having a lot of second thoughts. I feel like maybe my intuition is trying to tell me something that I’m actively ignoring because he is a very seemingly nice man. 

I am admittedly wary of men. I’ve also considered the possibility that I’m just overthinking or looking for a reason for him to not be as good as he seems, because in my experience, they rarely are.

I would love to meet up and form more friendships if anyone is going through anything similar!

Since cancer itself isn’t a full blown personality trait: I’m a crazy cat lady and love animals. I also have a little dog I love taking out and about with me - I really loved taking her to breweries in the past but I’m now sober because of the cancer - however, any dog friendly breweries that have non alcoholic options would be high on my list of fun things to do! I also love coffee/tea shops, farmers markets, and book shopping/reading/book clubs, horror movies and all things Halloween/horror related, and, I’m hoping to slowly get in to yoga soon (when my body is up for it).

My bf and I met and created a special connection when we were 16 but wewr not in any sort of relationship or never get intimate . 
4-5 yrs of no contact due to family reasons and I didn't knew if he was alive or not . And know  we willl never have a future together . 
Met again through social media ., felt like meeting a person I lost pr something , get in relationship. 

OUR PAST 

 About him :
 he was physically abused by the men of his family and used for money ( not sexually ) , constantly compared emotionally neglected , forced to drop school( after 10)  since he was 7 yrs old . Giving him extreme. Trauma . He said he abused animals like beatien them but has stopped. Now ( I'm an animal lover )  more bad things too  but he wasn't fully at fault . ( He was young ) 


About me :
 i always felt emotionally wounded and easily get attached of someone will be a little kind to me . At 16 I was emotionally neglected , manipulated and betrayed by my guardian , faced worst financial crisis , family falling apart .. It was so bad for a month I didn't knew what was happening and started doing self harm , became suicidal for other 2 yrs , had digestive issues due to it and stopped exercising ( I was in taekwondo and yoga ) 
Recently started again  ( after 6 yrs) 

IN SHORT,

In the no contact time I did slept with a guy and went on some normal coffee dates etc etc . I told everything to him for him to make a choice if he wanted to be in a relationship.
 I said getting with another guy wasn't a mistake back then 
6 months into it ( he didn't believe my past and shrug it off in starting ) . We were in long distance whole time of reading, he don't express much . 
I keep on teasing comparing him without realising . I feel being  very TOXIC 

For another 8 months he started becoming emotionally abusive and would interrogate me for hours over phone . He felt cheated betrayed being lied on and manipulated by me . But i have bad memory. So wve if I lie or tell him truth he gets angry . I felt saying weird things he thinks I twisted truth . 
He tells me it's his another personaly who says mean things to me not him 

Lot of time I told him fake things so he would break up bcs of my family and his family enmity in starting 6 months  ( I tried convincing him from the start though but he had a panic attack or cry so I would get stop everytime ) 

He gave threats saying it's his another personality, to hurt me my family himself , kill my ex or other guys I was involved with . 

He was mentally sick maybe, panic attacks and chest pain . I suggested therapy . He never took .

I don't know if he lied or what but he would emotionally abuse so badly saying my ex did this and that which he didn't but even I got confused at this part . 

I always felt I betrayed my family etc . 

DECEMBER 2024 

My mental health and sleep schedule bcs of him got so bad missed my final exam graduation  , and more bad . 
After this he came during exams after I missed one of them ., told him not to come

THE DAY OF 🍇

He got triggered on the evening before my last final exam , he said he can see me and my ex getting intimate etc , he was very angry , i complied .
He started doing that 🍇 , I felt no pain no pleasure , got numb , my hand was twisting so was my knee , asked him to stop for a moment atleast 4 times . , he didn't stopped 
, rather he gets very angry the 4th time .
He tightly hold my wrists while I started crying and he shouted that if I cry he will be more angry . 
Another 4 -5 mins what happened I don't remember that's how much scared I was 

So is this rape ? He didn't finished . I felt being at fault too . 


( He said later that my ex stopped when I told him to do why would he stop when I love him and uska poora haq hai mere pr.  He felt guilty said mera ego beech mai aa gya tha I'm sorry ) 

wanted to break up the same night 
 Obviously he wouldn't he gets sick or pretended don't know i forced him to take his medicines
I had to take care of him can't leave him anywhere , in a dangerous place ( other people staring sometimes ) 
I made my internship report the whole night crying starving in cold in pain .( Ate a little something ) 
( Gave the exam too by next day 5 pm) Only then was I able to eat something 
. Worst day and night 


AFTERMATH AND FIR 

 ( Forced to FIR about him giving threats of if break up after the sexual abuse . 

I shrugged the abuse . 
He and I get intimate a little after that why idk

I go home started having nightmares can't sleep my body changed . I asked him to break up on context of family ( bcs I could see how my family is going now as i came after 2 yrs at home ) 
Secondly I was scared of his another personality and also I felt loosing all feelings bcs of that night

He didn't , 
Abusing me and giving  death threats to me and telling me he would kill my ex my this bla bla  saying it's his another personality 
Gave it my bestie too ( make her sex slave etc ) ( his bf get to see that ) 

Came back to hostel ( scared can't even touch my phone ) decide to go back to I
Home and tell parents everything. As my two friends helped me , but the day I had train my ex came the same morning since I wasn't answering his calls for 3 days ( 500-700 messages and so many calls ) 
Situation escalated , my relatives came

Forced to file FIR against him for threatening me if I break up ( didn't include SA)

1juxmz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1juxmz7/he_drowned_because_the_lights_went_out_now_hes/,He Drowned Because the Lights Went Out… Now He’s Back Every New Moon.,"Have you ever had a job that just felt wrong? Not just the kind of wrong where you drag yourself out of bed and mutter about your paycheck or your manager under your breath—but the kind of wrong that settles in your bones. The kind that makes your skin itch and your gut whisper, “You shouldn’t be here.” That’s my job.

I work alone as the lighthouse keeper at a place called Blackridge Point. You’ve probably never heard of it, and honestly, that’s for the best. It’s not on any popular maps. No tourists ever come close. Even locals pretend it’s not there. And you know what? They’re right to. Because something about this place feels like it was never meant to be found—like the earth itself regrets making room for it.

Now, normally, a lighthouse is supposed to help ships—shine a light so they don’t crash into rocks or get lost at sea. That’s the idea I had when I accepted the position. I thought I’d be doing something good. Helpful. Maybe even noble. But here? At this lighthouse? The light doesn’t guide anything. It traps something. It holds it in. The beam isn’t a welcome—it’s a warning.

And tonight? Tonight’s not like the others.

Tonight, I found something I was never supposed to find.

I wasn’t even searching for anything unusual when I found it. It was just a routine night shift, one of the hundreds I’ve done in this cold, salt-bitten tower that groans with every gust of wind. You’d think after two years, I’d have seen it all. But this place… this place always holds something back, just long enough to make you think it’s safe.

That night, I had decided to clean the supply room. Just something to break the endless silence. The room was cluttered with old, forgotten things—cracked lanterns, rusted tools, thick manuals that hadn’t been opened in decades. It smelled like mold and old wood and something else… something sharp in the back of the throat.

I was moving a stack of unused logbooks when I saw it. A brittle sheet of yellowed paper, wedged between the back wall and a shelf support beam. I pulled it free. It crackled under my fingers. No title. No signature. Just seven rules, handwritten in a shaky scrawl that made it feel like the person writing it hadn’t slept in weeks.

And those rules? They didn’t feel like the kind of thing someone made up for fun. They felt… lived.

“Lock the door at exactly 11:00 PM. If you hear knocking after that, do not open it. No one you want to see would be knocking.”

That was the first line. Simple. But chilling.

“The light must stay on. If it flickers, you must turn it back on immediately. Even if it means going outside.”

My heart skipped. I had done that before. Gone outside when the power glitched in a storm. I thought it was normal. Necessary maintenance.

“Avoid looking directly at the water after midnight. If you hear something calling your name, it is lying. If the water tries to talk to you, —shut your mouth and don’t answer.”

My breath caught. I remembered the time I thought I heard someone yelling from the cliffs. I had almost shouted back.

“If you see a man standing at the edge of the cliff, do not acknowledge him. Do not speak. Do not approach.”

A cold sweat began to spread across my back. I had seen someone like that. Just once. A few weeks ago. I thought it was a trick of the light.

“You must leave at exactly 4:00 AM. Not a minute before. Not a minute after.”

I’d always left around 4, but never on the dot. Never knew it mattered. Maybe it does.

“When the fog rolls in thick, do not look outside the window. You might see something you wish you hadn’t.”

I thought about the nights when the fog came in so dense I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. I had stared out the window just to feel less alone.

“Every new moon, the ship will return. Do not acknowledge it. Do not try to stop it. Do not watch.”

That one hit me hardest. I hadn’t seen any ship. But the moon was a sliver tonight. A new moon was coming.

I stood there, staring at the list, my hands trembling slightly around the edges of the paper. It felt like the air around me thickened, like the room itself held its breath.

At first, I laughed. A weak, shaky laugh. Thought maybe it was just some old joke from a previous keeper. Some creepy tradition to mess with the new guy.

But the longer I held that paper, the more the silence seemed to lean in closer. Like the whole lighthouse was watching me.

And deep down, I realized something.

This wasn’t a warning left behind.

It was a dare.

A test.

And without knowing it, I’d already been following some of the rules.

I’d already been playing the game.

Whether I liked it or not.

I tried to distract myself. Really, I did. I paced around the main floor of the lighthouse. Picked up a dusty book from the side table, flipped through pages without seeing a word. I even turned on the little battery-powered radio, hoping to catch a fuzzy station from the mainland—but all I got was static. Through it all, my hands wouldn’t stop shaking. They trembled like I’d been out in the cold too long, even though the thick stone walls of the lighthouse kept the wind out. It wasn’t the cold. It was fear—cold, quiet, creeping fear.

The first rule had seemed simple when I read it. “Lock the door at exactly 11:00 PM.” Easy, right? Just turn the key and walk away. So that’s what I did. I walked over to the heavy iron door, the one at the bottom of the spiral staircase, and I turned the lock. Once. Then again, just to be sure. The metal groaned in protest, like it didn’t want to be locked. That should’ve been my first clue.

And then—at exactly 11:03—I heard it. The knocking started.

Knock.

A pause.

Knock.

Another pause.

Knock.

Three slow, deliberate knocks. Then silence. The kind of silence that presses against your ears, waiting to see what you’ll do.

I froze where I stood, eyes wide. I hadn’t expected it to actually happen. I hadn’t even remembered hearing knocking before tonight. But now that I was really listening, really tuned in, it struck me—I had heard this before. Maybe not consciously, but deep in my brain, the sound had been there. Buried. Like a memory you pretend isn’t yours.

And that’s when it hit me: this had been happening every single night.

I just hadn’t noticed.

Or maybe—I hadn’t wanted to.

I took a step back from the door. The lighthouse was on a cliff. It’s not like someone could just wander up here. There’s a narrow trail that leads from the shore, and the rocks down below are sharp and unforgiving. You’d hear someone climbing that path. Their footsteps would echo.

But tonight? I hadn’t heard a thing. 

And then—

“Hello?” 

The voice hit me like a slap across the face. It was male. Low. A little rough, like someone who hadn’t used it in a while. But there was something… wrong. Like a song sung by someone who knows all the words but doesn’t understand the meaning. Too steady. Too careful.

“I… I think I’m lost,” the voice said.

I didn’t move. My jaw clenched tight enough to hurt. I stared at the door like it might reach out and grab me.

Lost? Out here? In the middle of nowhere? At night? It made no sense.

I don’t know how I knew, but I knew—that voice wasn’t right. It didn’t belong.

“Please,” it said again, softer this time, like it was trying to sound weak. “I don’t have much time… you have to let me in.”

I almost—almost—reached for the door. Something in me twitched. Reflex. Instinct. That old human habit of helping someone in need.

But then, my eyes flicked to the paper I’d tucked into my coat pocket.

Rule #1: Do not open the door.

My fingers tightened around the coat fabric. I stepped back.

The voice kept going, pleading, begging, insisting. Each word more convincing than the last. It tried to sound scared. Then kind. Then angry. But I kept still. Kept my mouth shut.

Then, without warning, the voice just… stopped.

Silence. Not even a breath.

And then, the footsteps.

But they weren’t the kind of footsteps that echoed on a stone path. No. These were different. No crunch of gravel. No rustle of brush. Just a soft, steady rhythm—like feet padding over empty air.

They didn’t head back down the trail.

They didn’t fade into the woods.

They simply… walked away. Into the pitch-black night that stretched beyond the lighthouse like an endless sea of nothing.

I didn’t breathe.

Then—something slid under the door. A soft, scraping sound like paper across stone.

I stared at the bottom of the door.

A piece of paper.

Bloodied.

Not just smudged—but soaked in dark, rust-colored blotches.

I hesitated. My fingers hovered near it, unsure. It could be a trick. It could be a trap. But leaving it there felt worse.

So, carefully, I picked it up. The edges were sticky. The smell—metallic, sharp, sickening.

I turned it over and slowly unfolded it.

There were words. Shaky, handwritten lines like the rules, but smaller, messier. I began to read.

But I didn’t get far.

Because the moment my eyes hit the second line—

The lights flickered.

Not a soft flicker. Not a gentle dim.

A hard stutter. On, off, on.

And for the first time that night…

I realized I wasn’t alone.

When I glanced at the clock, it read 12:00 AM exactly.

Midnight.

The second my eyes registered the time, the lighthouse light—my only real protection against whatever nightmares this place held—flickered again. A single, sharp blink. Then another.

Once.

Twice.

And then—darkness.

The beam that usually swept steadily over the black ocean just vanished. Gone. Just like that. No warning. No hum of dying power. Just... out. And in that instant, something deep inside me knew this wasn’t a simple malfunction. This wasn’t normal.

The second rule. I remembered it clearly now.

""The light must stay on. If it flickers, you must turn it back on immediately. Even if it means going outside.""

A cold jolt of panic ripped through my chest. My throat tightened. My heart started hammering so fast it felt like it might crack my ribs. I fumbled for the flashlight on the nearby table, snatched it up with shaking hands, and bolted for the staircase. The old spiral steps groaned beneath my feet as I raced up toward the lantern room.

The cold hit me halfway up.

Not normal cold. Not just sea air cold.

It was wrong.

By the time I reached the top, I could see my breath. Thick white clouds spilling from my mouth like smoke from a fire. My fingers were numb already, the metal railing burning my skin like ice.

And then—the light above me dimmed to a soft glow… and died.

Everything went black.

Total.

Utter.

Black.

I turned on my flashlight. The weak yellow beam cut through the room like a knife, shaking with every tremble of my hand. I swung it toward the generator, heart thudding in my ears louder than the wind outside.

I hit the main switch.

Click.

Nothing.

Not a spark. Not a hum. Nothing.

My breath caught in my throat. I moved toward the backup generator, hope clinging to me like a lifeline.

But something stopped me.

Not a noise.

Not a touch.

Just a feeling. That crawling, skin-tightening sense of being watched. Of something out there.

And then—from the corner of my eye—I saw it.

Something was standing outside.

Still. Unmoving. Just at the edge of the cliff, past where the light usually reached.

It wasn’t a person.

It looked like a person if you were squinting from far away and had never seen one before. It had the shape. The form. But something was off. It was too tall. Too thin. Its arms hung in a way that made my stomach twist. And where its face should’ve been—there was just a smear of shifting black. No eyes. No mouth. Just a suggestion of a head, swirling like smoke held in a jar.

It didn’t move.

It just stood there.

Watching.

Watching me.

Or maybe the lighthouse.

Either way, the message was clear.

The light was off.

And it was waiting.

I turned back toward the generator, my hands nearly useless from the cold. They slipped off the knobs once, twice, before I managed to grip the ignition switch. I glanced over my shoulder.

The shape had taken a step forward.

I panicked. Slammed my palm against the ignition.

Come on. Come on. Come on—

With a loud roar, the generator coughed, sputtered, and finally roared to life.

The light above me flared. It didn’t flicker—it blazed, shooting out through the foggy night like a sword made of fire. The whole room filled with a warm, blinding glow.

I turned, heart in my throat, and looked back toward the cliff.

Gone.

The figure was gone.

Not a trace. Not a footprint. Not a whisper in the wind.

Just the night.

And that cursed, endless sea.

“What? What was that?” I whispered to myself, as if saying it aloud would make it real. My heart thumped wildly in my chest, loud and uneven like a warning drum. My mind spun in circles, refusing to settle. Every second that passed made the silence around me feel heavier, like it was pressing down on my lungs. I tried to distract myself, moving clumsily from one half-done task to another — checking oil levels, adjusting the beams, wiping already clean surfaces — anything to keep my hands moving and my thoughts quiet. But no matter what I did, that sharp edge of unease only grew sharper.

People don’t take lighthouse jobs for fun. No one dreams about spending months isolated in a cold, creaking tower by the sea, cut off from the world. You don’t wake up one day and say, “I want to be alone with nothing but foghorns and sea spray for company.” No. You end up here because you're running. Hiding. Escaping.

My reason? It was simple. I had nothing left. Nothing to hold onto. Nothing to keep me in the world I once called home.

I grew up in a small, quiet town built on the edge of a reservation. The kind of place where stories floated in the wind and people still nodded at things unseen. My grandfather was a proud, wrinkled man who’d survived too much and said too little. He used to sit by the fire and tell us stories that sounded more like warnings than tales. He spoke of spirits that didn’t stay dead, voices that called from the water, and fog that carried more than just moisture. As a boy, I laughed it off. I thought it was just a part of our culture’s way of scaring kids into behaving.

But then... the crash.

My wife. My little boy. Gone. One rainy night and a slippery highway and just... nothing.

After that, everything my grandfather said started sounding less like myth and more like memory.

All I wanted was to disappear. To stop hearing the echo of toys that weren’t played with anymore. To stop seeing her mug in the cupboard and his boots by the door. I needed silence. Distance. Emptiness.

So when the job at Blackridge Lighthouse came up, I said yes without thinking twice. The pay was good, the expectations were low, and best of all, no one asked questions.

But now… now I was starting to wonder if I hadn’t chosen this place — if it had chosen me.

I tried to shake it off. Told myself I was just tired, that grief does weird things to the mind. I sat back down with my coffee, the cup trembling in my hand. Then, the old grandfather clock ticked past 12:30… and I heard it.

A voice.

“Hello?” I called out, more habit than hope. But the hairs on my arms stood up.

It was outside. By the water.

And it said my name.

Clear. Soft. Familiar.

My whole body stiffened. My mouth went dry.

Rule #3 of the Blackridge Keeper’s Manual: Avoid looking directly at the water after midnight

At first, I joked about the rules.

Laughed them off like some weird initiation prank, when I first got here. But I followed them. Always. Until now.

Because that voice… that voice wasn’t just any voice.

It was my mother’s.

And she’s been gone for ten years.

“No, no, no…” I whispered. But even as I said it, my legs began to move. Like they didn’t care what the rulebook said. Like they belonged to someone else.

I made my way to the small circular window, the one that gave me the perfect view of the sea. I didn’t even realize I was crying until the salt from my tears stung the corners of my mouth.

“Come down here. Please. I need you.”

That voice — it was her. The gentle way she used to call me when dinner was ready. The way she used to soothe me when I cried after nightmares.

My hands clenched the windowsill. My knees locked. My brain screamed don’t, but my heart whispered what if?

Then, I saw it.

The water wasn’t calm. It was moving, twitching almost, like it was panicking.

Something wasn’t coming through the water.

Something was pushing the water away.

It churned, spun, and pulled back in slow, hesitant waves, as if it wanted nothing to do with what was rising from below.

I couldn’t breathe.

Because it began to take shape.

Not a man. Not a woman. Not any creature I’d ever seen or read about.

But a shape. Living. Wrong. Impossible.

It didn’t belong in this world.

“No. No, what the hell is that…” I whispered, my voice cracking.

And for the first time in my life, I realized that water — the very thing we need to live, the thing that brings life and peace and calm — could be horrifying.

Oh my God. Oh my damn God.

My survival instincts kicked in, sharp and fast. My eyes slammed shut without permission.

And then, the sound.

A scrape.

Right against the window.

Slow. Scratching.

Like fingernails.

One. By. One.

I froze. I didn’t breathe. The only thing I heard was the pounding of blood in my ears.

Then — silence.

No voice. No whispers.

When I dared to open my eyes, the window was fogged with thick condensation.

And written across the glass, as clear as daylight:

DON’T BREAK THE RULES.

By now, I was a wreck — completely drained, inside and out. My nerves felt like frayed wires sparking with every sound. My fingers wouldn’t stop trembling, even when I clenched them into fists. My chest was tight, like something heavy had settled inside it and refused to move. I kept telling myself that if I could just make it to morning, things would be okay. Maybe it would all seem like a dream. A horrible, twisted dream. I just had to hold on. But my body didn’t believe my thoughts anymore. I was tired. And scared in a way I hadn’t known a person could be scared.

I don’t even remember how the hours slipped away after that thing at the window. One moment, it was just after midnight. Then it was nearly four. My mind had stopped keeping track of time — like it knew it didn’t want to be awake for what came next.

At 3:45, the world changed again.

It started with a smell — wet and heavy, like rotting seaweed and damp rope. Then, the fog came in. Thick. Too thick. It rolled in like it had a mind of its own, curling around the lighthouse in heavy blankets, choking the light. I could barely see the edge of my own desk. It was the kind of fog that didn’t just block sight — it swallowed sound too. Everything became muffled. Still.

I tried to keep my eyes down. I really did. I stared at the floor, blinked fast, focused on the beat of my heart. But then… I heard it.

Creeeeak.

Wood. Old, splintering wood under pressure.

Then another sound — metallic, low and dull.

Clang. Clang.

It rang out in the distance like a bell being swayed by an unseen hand.

A ship’s bell.

I stopped breathing.

Carefully, like a child hiding under the covers, I turned my head just enough to look through the window again. The fog was so thick, I thought I’d see nothing. But then, faintly, like a memory rising from deep sleep… I saw it.

A ship.

Barely visible. Like a shadow in the mist.

It glided across the surface of the ocean — too smooth, too quiet. No splashing. No waves around its hull. It didn’t disturb the water at all. It was just… moving. Silently. As if it wasn’t part of the world we know.

Its sails were torn, flapping gently like old fabric left to rot. The wood of the ship was cracked, discolored, and yet it held together as if stubbornly refusing to sink. It was wrong. This ship didn’t belong to this time — maybe not to any time.

And then I saw the figures.

They stood along the deck. Still. Watching.

They were shaped like people… but not truly people anymore.

Some of them were missing arms. One had no face at all — just smooth, pale skin stretched over where features should be. A few stood with mouths open, wide and empty, their jaws slack in endless screams. But none of them made a sound. They just stared. Every single one of them… facing the lighthouse.

Facing me.

I froze, unable to tear my eyes away. My skin crawled. My legs locked up. I couldn’t run, couldn’t even blink.

Then, one of the figures moved.

It raised its hand.

Not in greeting. Not in peace.

It pointed.

Right at me.

I felt like throwing up. My stomach twisted in on itself. My mind screamed for an explanation, but deep down — somewhere I didn’t want to look — I already knew.

This wasn’t some forgotten ghost story passed down from drunken sailors.

This was real.

All of it.

The rules. The whispers. The scratching on the window. The voice that sounded like my mother.

The ship.

It wasn’t just floating through the mist for no reason.

It was coming back. Again. And again. And again.

And now I understood why.

The bloodied paper I’d found earlier this night — crumpled and stuffed behind the logs — it had told the truth. I hadn’t understood it before. I hadn’t wanted to.

But now it made perfect, terrible sense.

The last keeper — he had made one mistake. Just one.

He had let the lighthouse go dark, even if only for a minute. And in that minute, the sea took what it wanted. The ship had crashed. Lives were lost. Or maybe something worse than lives.

Now, every new moon, the ship returned. Searching. Yearning. Not for answers.

For vengeance.

And if it couldn’t find him — the one who had failed — it would take whoever had replaced him.

Me.

My legs gave out, but I caught myself on the desk. I turned away from the window. I didn’t want to see it vanish. I didn’t want to watch those lifeless faces melt into the fog.

But I knew it had disappeared.

Back into the sea.

For now.

And something inside me whispered the truth I didn’t want to say out loud:

It would come back.

And next time… it might not leave empty-handed.

I didn’t let myself breathe again until my boots touched the damp stone just outside the lighthouse at exactly 4:00 AM. The moment I stepped into the open air, my lungs filled with a sharp, cold breath that hit me like a slap. The sky had begun to change — not quite light, not yet morning — just that eerie shade of gray that makes everything feel uncertain. The mist still clung to everything, not as thick as before, but heavy enough that the world still felt muffled and far away. Like the fog didn’t want to let go of the night. Like it wanted to hold me there a little longer.

I turned around slowly. Behind me, the lighthouse stood tall and silent. The golden beam of its rotating light sliced clean through the mist, like a sword fighting back the darkness. It was steady. Reliable. A symbol of safety for anyone out at sea. But for me?

It didn’t feel like safety anymore.

It felt like a warning.

I had done what I was told. I hadn’t broken any rules. I’d kept the light going, kept my eyes mostly where they should be, kept myself from listening too closely to voices I shouldn’t have heard. I had survived the night.

But at what cost?

And for how long could I keep doing this?

I stood there, staring at the rotating light, as if it could give me answers. I had spent the last two years telling myself this place was peace. Telling myself I had found escape in the silence, in the isolation. I told myself that I had run here to find quiet after my life had been ripped apart.

But what if that was never the truth?

What if I hadn’t come here to escape anything?

What if I had been called here?

The idea slithered into my mind, slow and sickening. What if I wasn’t just hiding from pain… but being punished by it?

Maybe this wasn’t a job. Maybe it was a sentence.

Maybe Blackridge didn’t offer solitude. Maybe it offered a cage made of fog and regret — a place where men were sent to feel every mistake echo forever in the sea.

And suddenly, something became painfully clear:

No matter how closely I followed the rules…

No matter how loyal I stayed to the routine, how sharp I kept the light, how silent I kept my thoughts…

One day, the lighthouse wouldn't protect me.

One day, I wouldn’t be allowed to leave.",3,1744173673.0,nosleep,0,0.71,False

This episode showcases the crew in turmoil and getting antsy as Tony potentially doesn’t come out of his coma. 

Chris recklessly and immediately attempts to extort JT into a screenplay that will net him Hollywood approval. 

Bobby immediately (I believe at the behest of Janice), begins recklessly forcing himself in quick score ideas with the shooting of delux’s artist for a quick $7k. 

Lastly Vito begins pressing inroads towards a quiet coup. We see in episode Mayhem after hypocritical Paulie makes a massive score off Vito’s tip, he slow-plays paying Carmela with the hope/expectation Tony passes. Vito we see (who I believe is a NY mole the entire season but that’s another post for another day), attempts to get close to Phil to garner outward support for a coup. He also briefly pitches it to Larry Boy and he attempts to take over Eugene’s stops after his suicide. 

In a scene half way through the episode, Paulie stops by and graciously asks Carmela when can he see the “skip.” Carmela, who this same episode allows Father Phil, Artie, Sil, and others stop by and get a glimpse,  she reluctantly tells Paulie “hospital rules you know we’ll try to sneak you in.” This scene is right before she sees AJ on the news. 

Later, Sil due to his asthma and underlining inability to deal with the pressures boss, ends up in the hospital. It’s here Carmela senses trouble. The next scene she appears out of nowhere near Vito at the coffee table and asks about the healthy if Sil. Rather she states “what’s happening to us.” Here she is trying to get a feel for if Vito will follow through with her piece of the pie. 

Vito does the obvious and makes a statement regarding people watching them so they can’t get it to her. Her facial expression shows her quiet rage/discontent. 

She immediately after that scene allows Paulie to immediately go in and see Tony. Paulie states, “Now your mom says this is our big moment“ as Meadow leads him in to see Tony. 

Sil tells Carmela earlier in the show she has a significant package coming from Vito/Paulie. Once Sil goes to the hospital, that commandment doesn’t HAVE to be carried out because no one can enforce it but Sil/Tony who are on the canvass at the time. 

This scene gives a sneak peek into the future off screen. That once and when Tony is truly removed, Carmela will have nothing coming to her. ",1,1744173425.0,thesopranos,2,1.0,False

One coffee cup, one rocking chair, one garden, one dog. I've never really believed someone would want to share that with me or more aptly, that I would let them.

I'm a bit of a horny freak. Quick to comment on the beauty of a man, quick to try and sleep with him. Quick to drive him away, often quicker to discard him. I've always been a fan of the lumberjack types, always been the effeminate of the pair, always been comfortable with that. It's undoubtedly an expression of Patriarchy or  Misogyny or Homophobia what have you. To some degree I fear its inescapable. To a far greater degree I fear I won't be able to kill that part of me in time to be a good partner to A.

A is wonderful in every way I can think of. He's fierce, he's capable, he's intelligent, he's quick. I say an idea aloud and he runs with it as far as he can. I've never see him look at a problem and say anything besides ""I'll figure it out"". As soon as I start spending time with someone I feel my social battery fade. With him I barely feel the time pass. ""Talk like a Prince, Walk like a Soldier,"" was my mother's mantra, I've worked my entire life to uphold that facade (its usually worth the crushing weight). After knowing me less than a week he said ""You're insecure but you make it work,"" and I felt a weight fall off my shoulders. I still feel lighter when I'm with him.

I nearly kissed him tonight. I stood at arm's length so I wouldn't. I walked him to his door as we finished singing ""Hymn for Virgil"" By Hozier. Oddly enough my namesake. There's a line that always forces me to think of him.
""I wouldn't be seen walking through any door someplace you aren't welcome to,""

We planned a trip to see Hozier over the summer, had the opportunity to stay in my brother's motel outside the city, for free mind you, but I couldn't shake the feeling he'd be treated as anything other than A. Anything other than a man that is. So I changed the trip, the tickets, the rental pretended I got a deal on Groupon, that the flight was cheaper.

I never want to darken the door he can't pass through as himself. Though I'm terrified my internal prejudice will cause the same pain.

I don't typically think of him sexually despite the fact I do for most men. I want to be intimate with him but I've never been with anyone aside from the rather masculine (exclusively Cis) types. I'm worried the two are related. I'm worried my notion of masculinity and what I'm attracted to excludes him. I'm worried I wont desire him as he deserves to be. I'm afraid of how that would make him feel. To know that I, a person who cares about him a lot, don't see him exactly as I should, as he deserves to be seen.

When I imagine my future I'm always alone. I see my little cottage, my well trained dog, my well kept garden, my one coffee mug. Lately, I've been imagining two cups, two dogs, two chairs, two gardens. I want the second one to be his.

1juxh7b,https://i.redd.it/anzqu0kylqte1.png,Passed AT/AT/AT- What I did to study for in just over a month.,"**Study Plan**

I started studying on the weekend of March 1st. I followed the AR study plan to complete his course for the most part since I didn't want to rush through and overdo it with too many hours a day. I had done the class before, so it was a good review of ""mindset"" and great for building up my traditional PM knowledge. Between life stuff and the length of the course, this took about two weeks.

Once I was done with the AR course, I started reviewing the [Third Rock Notes](https://third3rockpmp.com/) I purchased after reading about them here. I sat down one day at a coffee shop and went through the whole thing (it's short- like 60 pages) and made careful notes, highlights, and flagged pages I found helpful for reviewing concepts. After that, I would review the notes every few days (not daily) and find it a good way to start studying or fit it in when a lot is happening and you don't want to do SH.

At the same time as I started reviewing Third Rock material, I signed up for [PMI Study Hall Plus](https://www.pmi.org/shop/us/p-/digital-product/pmi-study-hall-pmp-plus/dp017). In hindsight, Essentials would have been fine. As others have said, it's a great tool, and the questions here are more challenging than the actual test. I saw no question like an ""expert"" question you see doing SH.

The SH mini-tests and practice questions are excellent. They're a good way to get a snack-size portion of the tests. I wish the explanations for getting them wrong were better. I only took 3 full-length exams, scoring 65%, 74%, and 78% the week before the test. I took the last practice exam two days before the test.

In that latter two-week period, I also watched the videos below, making an effort to make watching one of these videos my main study goal when I watched it that day. I watched each only once.

[AR- 200 Ultra Hard PMP Questions 1-200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sWpc6765AI): GREAT for people like me who like his learning style. The questions are well done and just as hard as SH.

[David McLachlan- 110 PMP Drag & Drop Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwNUBe21jtM)— I liked this because it helped me become familiar with drag and drop and is a good way to review terms for people like me who don't like flashcards.

**Takeaways:**

\- Mindset, mindset, mindset, mindset, mindset. It's what will answer questions. Know what it means to think in traditional, agile, and hybrid.

\- Don't overdo it. I studied for 3 hours a day at most unless it was a full length exam day,

\- Regarding ITTOS, please don't memorize; you should know what they do and then review their functions. The test wants to see if you understand why and what goes with what.

\- I didn't memorize formulas because of any formula. Focus more on what the formula DOES- for example- know that in a situation with an SPI of 1.0 indicating on-schedule performance, >1.0 ahead, and <1.0 behind. When you get an SPI question- it'll be up to you to figure out what a number like ""0.8"" or ""1.2"" means in terms of being over/under. Any related math will be rough numbers like this.

\- Suppose you come from one background (i.e., agile or traditional) and invest study time learning the other. I went from an agile-heavy background, so for me, traditional was the thing to focus on and where I spent more time.

\- If you are a quick reader and get through questions quickly, use the review time. I tend to go through tests rapidly, so I used the time at the end of each section to review every question. In each section, I changed at least 2-3 answers.

\- Uss your break time! Stretch! GET BLOOD FLOWING

**Don't freak out if you can't get an in-person testing situation; do it at home!**

You can just be smart and prep your space. I cleaned my office and made it very tidy. I covered my bookcases and made sure there was visible writing anywhere. I also cleaned off my desk.  I used a laptop in a docking station with an external monitor and a camera. Since the laptop monitor is closed, I showed the proctor that the dock prevented the screen from opening.

If you test at home, make sure your room is dead quiet and that you look presentable to your proctor. You will speak to them on the laptop, and my proctor had me use my webcam to show him my room to make sure everything was okay.

BE NICE to the proctor. Don't be mean or weirdo; they will be friendly throughout check-in.

**Last thoughts-**

\- After the test, it took me just under 18 hours to get results. I know this is unusual; sometimes, it can take up to 48 hours.

\- The test was easier than I thought it would be.

\- Be practical, study smart, and UNDERSTAND MINDSET, and you will finish the test with complete confidence you passed.",4,1744173070.0,pmp,1,1.0,False

1juxgyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApoE4carriers/comments/1juxgyn/reducing_stress_without_overcomplicating_it/,Reducing Stress (Without Overcomplicating It),"I know it sounds basic—but honestly, these small habits helped me way more than I expected. Especially after finding out I carry APOE4, I went through a stretch where the stress felt… constant.

If you’re in that space—processing new health info and feeling a bit overwhelmed—these three things helped me re-center:

**1. Meditation + Journaling**  
Tried a few apps (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer) until one stuck. Even 5 minutes made a difference.  
Journaling wasn’t about being profound—it was just a brain-dump. Get everything out, no editing.

Then I’d finish with 2–3 things I was grateful for.  
Sometimes it was deep (“my brain still works”), sometimes tiny (“coffee tasted amazing this morning”).

Both shifted my perspective.

**2. Move Your Body. Lift Something Heavy. Break a Sweat.**  
Exercise became my reset button.  
Cardio helped clear the noise. Strength training gave me a sense of control over my health.  
And yeah—feeling stronger in the mirror doesn’t hurt either.

Everything got better:  
→ My sleep  
→ My mood  
→ My stress levels

There are truly no downsides.

**3. Walk in Nature**  
This one surprised me. I used to write it off as woo-woo.

But then I read about *shinrin-yoku*—Japanese forest bathing. There’s real science behind it: reduced cortisol, stronger immunity, improved mental clarity.

Even without the data, walking in the trees just… feels good.

Worst case: you got some fresh air and hit your step count. Best case? You came back lighter—mentally and physically.

No hacks, no silver bullets—just habits I wish I’d leaned into earlier.

If you're feeling that underlying stress, start small. But start.

Some basic info is that he is in my history class, I know his name, and I think he’s cute and am mainly just interested in getting to know him better. I don’t know much about him outside of him liking Warhammer. I like Warhammer mini-figs but don’t actually know much else about it. Regardless, I myself am pretty nerdy and would love to talk about nerd stuff with him and overall get his general vibe down to see if my interest grows. 

Since I don’t talk to him and just see him around class I wanted to know the best way of going about this. My main approach is going up to him someday and asking if he’d like to get some coffee or breakfast and get to know each other better, but I’ve never been in a relationship and would love to know if that approach is decent and if it’ll work! 

I’m also from a culture that sort of frowns upon women approaching men in relationships, so I generally feel awkward about it.

1juxa0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1juxa0k/i_wish_i_could_transfer_my_existence_to_someone/,I wish I could transfer my existence to someone who needs it more,"I have always had an internal wish that I could just transfer or give my life to someone who was passing on that desperately wanted to live; a flatlining mother who wanted to see her kids again, a child succumbing to a terrible rare disease that wants to be a baseball player when they grow up, A person with a trip to Paris on their bucket list, but didn’t get to see it in time.

In school, I remember reading this Sci-Fi book called *Unwind.* It was about the aftermath of a war fought over reproductive rights. A compromise was reached, where parents could sign their children off to be “unwound” at age 13, i.e. have their body parts harvested for future use. There was a quote that resonated with me at the very beginning of the book. “I was never going to amount to much anyway, but now, statistically speaking, there’s a better chance that some part of me will go on to greatness somewhere in the world. **I’d rather be partly great then entirely useless.**” That last part always got to me.

I was born 3 months prematurely, which led to a mild physical disability in one of my arms. It’s noticeably shorter than the other and much of the muscle mass that was in it had to be scraped away like fat trimmings. While it wasn’t unusable, I still couldn’t do some tasks like a normal child would. When I first learned to write, I did it on a slanted board almost like an easel. I couldn’t support my own weight if I hung from playground equipment, and there were some gym class activities that I had to sit out of.

Oddly enough, it wasn’t the physical stuff that affected me the most. It was the mental side of things most of the time. I always had an inkling that something was wrong with me since I was little. I either made too much eye contact, or too little, I often found myself daydreaming too often, and I was too sensitive. I remember my Kindergarten teacher being my first real school bully. I was belittled for every mistake, micromanaged, singled out, and screamed at to the point of tears.

 I always felt different, and I think others perceived me that way too. It was always, “that kid’s too quiet; he’s weird; he’s a complete idiot.” For a while, I believed them. I never really got the best grades, the teacher could’ve been writing math on the board in Mandarin, and it still wouldn’t have made a difference. My grades stunk until midway through my sophomore year of high school. I excelled in my English classes, and I had a math tutor that explained thing in a way I could understand. My GPA shot up from a 2.7 to a 4.0 my junior year. Many people were happy with me and supportive, but there were always the others that acted like “why does this conceited prick think he’s so smart all of a sudden?”

I went on to college and graduated with a 3.9 overall. I even had a job lined up in my field of study (Comm. and Journalism, that’s totally useful, right?). Finally, it felt like I proved all those classmates and teachers wrong. I *was* smart enough, and I *could* do it.

Things took a turn when that dream job became a nightmare. I made less there than at the retail job I’d left to take it. I was overworked, handling the duties of an entire media team while my efforts were constantly scrutinized. I stretched myself to the point of insomnia, stress nosebleeds, and burnout, but somehow, I wasn’t a team player because I couldn’t stretch myself out just *that* much further. I eventually left for a more relaxed customer service job, which led to a marketing internship. However, I was frequently pulled away from the internship to cover staffing gaps and help a manager that didn’t know mouse shit from coffee grinds. The promise of a full-time position was dangled over my head, so I figured I’d just embrace the suck for a while. When said full-time position finally came up, I was never notified about it. By the time I applied, it was given to someone else. I took that to mean they had someone else in mind from the get-go. If I did something wrong or was just shit at my job, I wish they would’ve just told me. I was expected that I’d just crawl back to the department that overworked me like a good little invertebrate. I put in my two weeks’ notice (with nothing else lined up), so both positions ended at the same time.

Since then, I’ve been working low-paying jobs. I ended up taking a job in a mailroom. They were the only job that said yes to me after months of applying and I needed the money.

 I spent a year doing an accredited Paralegal certification while working. It honestly hasn’t been worth the time or effort. I called various law firms inquiring about positions, even ones for secretaries, and I was turned down. The one that did have an open position, told me they were looking for someone that was bilingual, on top of having the cert. I almost threw my phone against the wall after the call ended.

So now I’m officially stuck. I’m hesitant to go back to school and just shell out more cash for a degree that’s going to leave me high and dry again. I could quit my job, but I’d probably end up in some call center or back in CS. That to me, sounds like trading a rough road for a rougher one. I can’t go into the military, because if my arm doesn’t keep me out, the anti-depressants that I’m taking sure would.

If I could give my life to someone who truly wanted to hold onto theirs, I’d do it. A kid, a mom, somebody who’s worth something gets to stay, and a classic fuck-up gets to leave. It’s an even trade. When all the small victories have led to a dead end and the pattern is likely to continue, it doesn’t seem worth it. It’s like a bowling pin getting knocked down and reset. If someone out there still had a bit of fight left in them, wouldn’t it make more sense for them to have this time instead?

1jux95l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jux95l/i_36f_thinking_of_leaving_my_44m_husband_is_there/,"I [36F] thinking of leaving my [44M] husband, is there something to salvage?","I'm just so goddamn tired. We both work, a lot. Like, a lot, a lot, a lot. And we have 2 young children. And a lot of other responsibilities. But I try to make a conscientious choice to carve out quality time for us as a couple, and as a family. We've been together for 9 years and married for nearly 6. 

We've talked a lot about love languages over the years, and mine, without a doubt, are quality time and acts of service. I feel loved when people do things for me (not even big things, but just like, bring me a cup of coffee when you think about it, or take the trash out without me asking). His is, without a doubt, physical touch. Trouble is, it's hard to feel like touching someone when your needs aren't being met right? Like you're getting left out in the cold?

I'm getting ahead of myself. He's missed multiple family vacations (1 per year) at the last minute for work. I haven't bothered trying to plan anything this year. I'm sure me and the kids will go somewhere, but here's the heartbreak:

When we met, we loved to go on adventures together. To travel, and explore new cities, and go out and do things. We don't go anywhere together anymore. We go to work and home and we're both exhausted all the time. I mean, he still travels a lot for work. I don't. The adventure is gone, and I wasn't made to sit at home on the couch or work 100 hours a week. It just isn't who I am, and I miss myself here. 

He's also incredibly spread thin and high stress; I don't feel like this life we have going right now is sustainable. I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells with him, and maybe that's not entirely his fault; I try to see things from an objective standpoint because I've been in therapy enough to know that I grew up managing other people's emotions and so me feeling like I'm on eggshells might be more on me than on his behavior BUT, when he gets all bent out of shape about something, he does the thing where he gets silent and leaves (which is super productive in dealing with a problem, right?); And again, with me in therapy, I know I have 'abandonment issues' which I guess I shouldn't air quote because that's a real thing, but here's the kicker, because of those issues, every time I feel like I'm on the verge of being abandoned (emotionally or otherwise) my brain goes straight to divorce. 

In the past, when this thought has come up, I've known deep down it wasn't the correct or 'real' solution, it was just traumatized me trying to escape discomfort (and by discomfort I mean, dealing with a problem or feeling). I'm very independent and that hyper independent soul of mine says ""you don't need him!"" ""You can live without him!"" 

But most recently something changed. He said something that pissed me off (told me how to clean something, it was just unnecessarily micromanaging), and I didn't respond. He asked if he'd pissed me off. I said yes. And then he started yelling about how he doesn't even know how to talk to me anymore and I realized it's because I've stopped taking his shit, and his judgement about everything. He flipped over in the bed in huff and went to sleep and I realized I didn't care that he was pissed. Like, I was just so empty. 

I know this post is so so long already but I have so much more to say...

Even when we've had a less than stellar period in the ebb and flow of our relationship, our sex life has always been good, but the last time he touched me I realized I was just.... waiting for it to be over. 

Years ago I begged him to go to couples therapy. I sent him quotes for an online service so we wouldn't even have to go anywhere and we could schedule it anytime, not just normal office hours. He ignored it forever, then finally agreed, then complained about the cost, and we never did it. I was so relieved during the brief period when he finally agreed to therapy that I sobbed with my entire body. Shaken. And it just....never fucking happened. 

I've asked for him to figure out ways to get more off of his plate. We've actually come up with some really great solutions for a lot of things to take things off his plate, but every time there's space, he piles more on. I've been the supportive spouse (while doing my own thing too) for so long, but I'm tired of asking for him to carve out space for me, and I've realized I will never be a priority for him, and if I stay with him I will always feel like I am drowning, I will always be pushed underwater by the turbulent waves of our life together, and I tired of struggling and gasping for air, and being kept alive by a few moments here and there. 

When I ask for time with him, the answer is always that, he works this much for us. And I know that's true. But I also know he works this much because he is driven to. I wouldn't go as far as saying he loves it or it makes him happy- I think there is happiness in moments of success, but I think he is driven by the need to achieve more, more, more.

Almost every day, we sit together and have the ""what's your day like tomorrow"" conversation, and tonight I dared mention something I'd like his help with and he about bit my head off because he 'already has too much to do tomorrow'- I just wanted to mention it. I told him he's been doing that a lot lately, and prefaced it with ""I know you're stressed, but I'm not the enemy"" He stormed off to bed and then sent me an apology text that he feels like the bad guy at every turn lately and wants it to stop.... I know this isn't entirely about me, some of that feeling is bubbling up from work things too, but ... yeah, I also want this to stop. I want to stop feeling like I can't have a simple conversation with the person I'm raising two little humans without him snapping at me. 

I sometimes worry about what they're learning of emotional intelligence in this house. I feel he rules a bit too much with an iron fist and not enough compassion for people so small, figuring things out. No, whining and tantrums are not okay, but I always want to get to the root of the problem and talk about ways to express ourselves and our wants and needs better, even while understanding we may not get the thing we are asking for - and I feel like he just shuts them down during their own meltdowns, which I worry is teaching them to bury their emotions and not deal with them properly. I wonder if consistently shutting down my own needs is teaching them that a relationship should look like this. But this could be a whole post unto itself, and I'm getting a bit in the weeds here with the rambling I'm doing. 

Lately I've begun fantasizing about life after him. Thinking if we had two households, how there might actually be space in mine for me to exist. That I would feel less lonely, because I do feel like I'm in the relationship alone, and I fear I've lost friendships to it because I've prioritized a person who isn't even present. I feel like I'd get more breaks from the kids and feel less like a single, working mom. I'm not thinking about anyone after him. I'm literally fantasizing about being alone. Is that weird? Am I okay?

This is obviously a throwaway account and I've been somewhat vague which has hampered my ability to convey some of the nuance of this story well, but I hope it's made a little sense. I wish I had someone in real life I could unload to but there isn't really anyone, and I don't want to demonize him to our friends. I still love him, I just don't know if I can live like this anymore.",0,1744172263.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False
