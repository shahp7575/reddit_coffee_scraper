1hn8ktf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hn8ktf/i_returned_to_my_childhood_home_and_now_i_cant/,"I returned to my childhood home, and now I can’t leave.","When I was a kid, I saw my father’s suicide. 

I know-heavy way to start this but I don’t have a lot of time and I cannot dance around the facts. It happened right in front of me. One minute, he was holding a gun, staring at me with this empty look in his eyes. The next, he was gone.

I can still hear the sound. Smell the gunpowder. See the way the room changed, especially the wallpaper behind where he sat. That moment is burned into my memory—the kind of thing you can’t unsee, no matter how much therapy you pay for. 

Speaking of my therapist, she said I’d carry that trauma forever. She was right. But she also said it would get better with time. Well, the thing is, no one ever tells you it could actually get worse with time.

So far, it has.

Why am I writing this now? Well, there have been some terryfying things happening to me these past few days. But let's back up a bit first so you have the entire context for the story.
 
About a year ago, my mom passed away. We hadn’t spoken in years. After my cancer diagnosis when I was younger, I’d gone into remission, moved out, and cut ties with her completely. She often used my cancer to make people feel sorry for her. She was a horrible mother. There was just too much baggage there, too much pain in that house. 

Then, out of nowhere, I got a letter from a lawyer telling me she’d left me the deed to her house. 

The house where I grew up. The house where my dad died. Where my mum would often swap my cancer drugs for sugar pills, keeping me sick.

I didn’t want to go back, but I didn’t have a choice. Since that letter a year ago, I’d lost my job, burned through my savings on various medical treatments, and couldn’t pay my rent anymore. I actually got an eviction notice, like you would see in a movie. Selling the house was the only way to get back on my feet.

When I pulled into the driveway, it was like stepping into a time capsule. The sagging roof, peeling paint, and overgrown lawn—it all looked just like I remembered. Inside, the air was stale and heavy, a mix of mould and mothballs, but every now and then, I caught a faint whiff of lavender. My mom’s old perfume. It made me sick. I immediately opened every window possible.

I spent the first night unpacking and clearing some of the clutter she had hoarded over the years. I guess she had gotten deep into weird cult ideology books. They were everywhere. 

When people are on their deathbeds as she was, it’s common for them to cling to, or ‘find’ religion,, a God or even cults that promise to be free. Well, that is what my therapist once told me when I too danced around the idea for a bit. 

Either way, I went to bed early, I was completely exhausted from the drive. But the next morning, everything changed.

When I walked into the kitchen, there was a Polaroid sitting on the counter.

It was a picture of me. 

Taken from outside the kitchen window.

I was standing there, holding a coffee mug, staring at my phone. But I hadn’t been in the kitchen yet that morning. And in the photo, I was wearing yesterday’s clothes.

Someone had taken that picture of me the day before.

I told myself it had to be some kids messing with me. Maybe someone from the neighbourhood who didn’t want the house sold—they’d made it clear to the lawyer they didn’t want developers tearing it down.

I stayed another night. I had to get this place ready to sell no matter how many people tried to scare me off. 

By that evening, my nerves were shot, but I decided to distract myself by tackling the mess in the attic. That’s when I found it.

The camera. 

It was an old Polaroid Land Camera, the same one that my dad used to carry everywhere. He loved that thing, and he was always snapping photos—me, my mom, the house, random things he thought were interesting, like his gun collection. Next to it was a dusty box filled with old pictures.

Most of them were harmless. Me as a kid, my mom waving at the camera-the cliche vintage Disneyland pictures. But near the bottom of the pile, the photos started to change.

One of my dad holding the gun.
Another of him pointing it at the camera.

And one of the aftermath—the couch, the wall behind him, stained dark.

Finally, there was one of me. A little boy, sitting on the floor, staring at Dad’s lifeless body.

I dropped the photos. My hands were shaking. I didn’t even know those pictures existed. I was the only one home when it happened. I dialled 911 for Christ's sake. Who the hell had taken them? 

I picked up the box and went downstairs to throw them in the bins outside, no one needed to see these ever again. That’s when I saw the fridge.

It was now covered in Polaroids.

Dozens of them taped haphazardly across the surface.

Each one was of me from the past 2 days. Brushing my teeth, alone. Eating dinner, alone. Sleeping in my bed, alone-or so I thought.

One was from that night. It showed me in the attic, looking through the box of photos.

Someone had been in the house, maybe even was still in the house at that moment. Watching me. Waiting. For what? I still don’t exactly know. 

I lost it. I ripped the pictures off the fridge, smashed the camera against the counter, and packed my bags. I wasn’t staying there another second.

I checked into a cheap motel in town that night. Locked the door, shoved a chair under the handle, and turned on every light in the room. For the first time in days, I felt a little safer.

Until the banging started.

It was just after midnight. Heavy, deliberate bangs on the motel door jolted me awake.

I unplugged and grabbed a lamp from the bedside and crept to the peephole.

No one was there.

I moved the chair, and when I opened the door, I found another Polaroid lying face down on the floor.

I flipped it over and froze.

It was me, in the motel shower, not four hours earlier.

I stumbled back, my heart was pounding. My vision was completely blurred, and I felt a wave of nausea hit me. I turned and there it was, sitting on top of my bag, the camera. 

Before I could think, my knees buckled. All I remember was hitting my head on the corner of the bedframe before it was lights out.

When I came to, I wasn’t in the motel anymore.

I was back in the house. Sitting on my father's old chair.

I don’t know how I got here. My bag is gone. My clothes are different. Everything feels... wrong. I’m scared. I dont know where my medication is and I feel sick to my stomach. Probably from the head knock.

I tried the doors and windows, but none of them would open like they had been glued shut.

I’m trapped.

Now I’m sitting at the kitchen table, typing this on my laptop. It’s the only thing I can think to do. Maybe someone out there will read this. 

Maybe you will figure out what’s happening. Maybe you have had the same experience and know how to get out.

But, as I write this, I can feel it. The hair on my neck is standing up. There’s a coldness behind me, a pressure like someone is watching. I know someone is.

I just heard it again.

CLICK.

The unmistakable sound of that Polaroid camera.

I can’t turn around. I won’t. Not just yet. My hands are trembling, but I just keep typing, as if finishing this will make it stop. Maybe it’s all in my head. Maybe it’s the fear. Maybe it’s all of it eating away at me.

And just now, a Polaroid has floated down from somewhere above me, it has landed right in front of my keyboard.

I am scared.

It’s a picture of me. Sitting in my father’s chair. There’s a gun in my slumped hand, the same one he used. And behind me, the wall is painted red.

Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to run, but I can’t move. My legs feel bolted to the floor. My pulse thunders in my ears, drowning out every sound except the next one.

CLICK.

The camera just went off again, and I heard the Polaroid fall out and hit the floor beside me. 

Don’t look down idiot. But how can I not?

I did-It is of me sitting here, right now. 

If you’re reading this, it means it’s too late. 

Please, don’t come here. 

Don’t try to help. 

Don’t even think about this place.

And whatever you do—
don’t turn around.

CLICK-CLICK.

I feel so exhausted trying to find avenues to get a relationship. I’m 20 right now and the last time I had a girlfriend was when I was 16 and it was a toxic shit show. When I was 18 I had a girl lead me on and ghost me. I don’t say these things for pity or to say I have angry against girl I say it to give a frame of reference for what I’m dealing with. 

I have been on and off with dating apps for the last year and a half with hardly any matches. Only one I ended up talking to and it never went past that. I have worked with only guys for the last 3 years so no meeting though work. College has had nothing for me. First 2 semesters absolutely nothing. Third semester I’m sat next to a girl with similar interests as me so I try to do what I can. Ask her out to coffee multiple times, study with her, text her, but she has not given me a hint of interest back. I don’t live in a city so other options are limited. Tried to see if the library/other social places had any clubs or events that interest me and there’s barely anything. Look online for meet ups, closest one is over an hour away. Online dating/relationship suck massive fucking ass so I can’t see my self looking for anything like that anytime soon. 

I understand that I’m not a great looking guy. At my current build if I lost 10 pounds I’d have basically no fat on me. Even if I did that and washed my face a little more often I’m not sure I’d even be all that amazing looking. I feel like I’m a decent enough guy which I know sounds cringe to say but fuck. 

What do I even do from this point. I want a relationship, I want some to care about, I want someone to care about me, I want all the happy little moments.",2,1735279570.0,Healthygamergg,2,1.0,False

I didn't want my story to go to waste because I was actually so proud of it, so I'm sharing it on here. 

Ah, let’s see how many little ones we’ve got looking up at the sky today. That’s one… two… three… oh- and four, including the young woman as well. It’s quite nice being this big. Tall, too. Makes it easy to see everyone, and everyone to see me. Even as I’m working, I can see the whole city from where I am. If I had arms, I’d be waving back at the little kids. Although I am slow, I am a sight to behold- just look at all the children that stop in their tracks to stare. If you still haven’t figured out what I am, that’s alright, I’ll tell you. The kids like to call me ‘tall thingy’- cute, I know- but the adults call me a building or tower crane. What’s that? You want my full name? Really? Alright… I suppose I could tell you- but don’t tell the children, I’d prefer it if they stick to ‘tall thingy’, heh. The name is Terex, Terex CTL 140-10 TS21. It’s a mouthful, I know, so just call me Terex. Hey- why don’t you stick around for a bit? It gets a little… lonely in the winter. Make yourself comfortable in the cabin, it’s warm in there, I promise. Be careful climbing down. There you go, much better in here than out on the jib- oh, just make sure not to press any buttons or pull any levers. 



Ah… this is what I like to see. The city night life in the winter. It’s beautiful, isn’t it? I like to look at each building and wonder what events and stories they hold. You’d be surprised at how much life goes on in each building. I’ll tell you one thing- I’ve been around since 2006, and since then, I’ve helped construct many, many buildings, and with each one, I’ve seen countless lives play out. What’s that? You want to know what kind of building I’m erected on? Well, it’s still in construction but this place is going to be a one of a kind office building, you know, the kind that makes people want to come into work every day, haha. But this is just one of the many buildings that I’ve come to love. I’ll tell you about the others that I’ve done in the past. Look out the window to your left. Do you see that little pink neon sign? It’s flickering a bit- yes, that one. The hospital right next to it, I helped construct that. Of course, I’m just an inanimate object, I can’t do nothin’ without an operator. In fact, all of my favourite buildings were constructed with the same operator each time. He and I got pretty close. His name was Sam. He was a good guy, young with a bright smile, and operated me like it was the most natural thing in the world. He was good at it, I’m telling you. Sam and I made that hospital together. It was built in 2013. Sam used to sit right where you’re sitting now, and he and I used to look at the finished work of the hospital, simply observing the life within it. We saw… lots of things. We saw a child with a pink bow beat cancer. We saw a wife say her goodbyes to her husband. We watched hundreds of new little people come into life. We saw someone's grandpa pass away with a smile on his face. A little boy's birthday was celebrated in the hospital room. Hah, that one I won’t ever forget. The smile on his face was priceless- I’d have a smile that big if I had a party like that. But Sam… Sam watched this couple lay together in the hospital bed every day at 6 pm. I always wondered why he had taken a liking to that couple. He always had a soft smile on his face, like he was reminiscing about something when he looked at them. I never pried, so I just let Sam stare. The hospital really was one of the good places… Oh, I should probably tell you about the apartment building Sam and I constructed on 7th street. You know where that is? Right beside Ben’s coffee shop- yes, that exact one. I’m sure you can see it from here… ah, would you mind turning me around? Yes- I know I told you not to press any buttons or pull any levers but this is important. Don’t worry, I’ll tell you what to do. First, you’ll have to engage my slewing mechanism- there’s a joystick on the left side of the control panel- no, not that one, the other one. Yes, that one, perfect. Now, pull it to the right- TOO FAST! Woah, easy there! The further you move the joystick, the faster I turn! What do you mean I should do it myself? Oh stop your complaining and pull the joystick… easy does it… ah, stop! Perfect. Good job. Hey, maybe you should be a tower crane operator, hehe. 



Ahem, now, as I was saying… ah, yes, the apartment. You can see it now, don’t you? Sam and I completed its construction in 2018. It’s a lovely building. Just like the hospital, we were able to see the life in that apartment thrive. I remember spotting several cats sitting in various windows. There was always a cat that was basking in the sun, summer or winter. I think it was an orange cat. It was cute, a little chubby too. I prefer cats, you know. They’re good companions, with excellent balance. I think they’re amazing creatures- beautiful, too. Sometimes, I think to myself, ‘if I can be any animal in the world, then I’d like to be a cat’. Why? Well, because a cat can go anywhere with ease! Plus, they’re lovely creatures. If you look opposite of the jib, you’ll usually find concrete weights to maintain my balance. But if I was a cat, I’d be able to balance just with the sway of my tail. Plus, I wouldn’t have to be stuck in one spot for so long. Fascinating, right? Oh- I’m getting distracted, where was I… oh yes, the apartment. Funny story, actually, Sam and I were constructing it and Sam accidentally fell asleep while operating. He fell asleep on the control panel in a way that he nudged the joystick just a tad. Then, I found myself spinning in slow circles. You should have seen the look on Sam’s face when he woke up and realized he was still on the job, haha. It was a lot of good memories. 



Don’t tell anyone, but Sam and his work buddies used to climb up and sit on my jib. It was dangerous- very dangerous and completely unsafe, sure, but it was… nice. I remember they used to eat their lunches there. Sometimes they would watch the sunset and just talk. They spoke about their families and their lives. I liked listening to their conversations. The more they spoke, the more… human they seemed. Sounds odd, I’m well aware, but I liked listening to the way that they talked and shared parts of their lives with each other. Sam especially. Sam used to talk the most, and always made everyone laugh. He was good at that, you know- making others laugh, I mean. He was good at telling jokes and putting smiles on other people's faces. It’s those moments that I miss the most… ah, sorry, I don’t know why I got so sentimental. I should show you the- hm? What’s that? You… want to know what happened to Sam? I… alright. I suppose I could tell you. You’ve been here the entire time, listening to me ramble on and on, you deserve it I guess. I’ll start from the beginning so that you can understand Sam’s story. It’s the least I can do for him. Sam was young when he got the tower crane operator job. He was excited, like a kid in a candy store. He was a good employee, always did the job and did it so effortlessly. Outside of work, Sam was a university student, very diligent in his studies and never failed a course- as far as I know, at least. Heh, I used to watch Sam sneak some of his textbooks and notes into the cabin to study when he was on break. It was quiet enough for him to study, and he was always striving to do his best. He was a good man, inside or outside of school and work. I-  I don’t know why I haven’t noticed, but Sam was struggling. Struggling with both school and with work. He had to work hard to have both. He couldn’t just leave school or leave his work. He was overwhelmed. Nobody noticed it. It was impossible to notice his depression when Sam was constantly smiling and cracking jokes and sharing his dreams. You never would have assumed that something was wrong. But there was something wrong. Something deeply, horribly wrong. Sam was overwhelmed to the point where he couldn’t take it anymore. 



And so, one day, Sam was supposed to finish the office building that we were working on, it was supposed to be the last day of work and then our job for this project would have been completed. But he did not come into work that day. I immediately felt as though something was wrong. Sam was always so diligent and punctual, there was no way he would just not show up. He didn’t even call in sick or let anyone know anything. He was just… not there. His coworkers just assumed that he was sick or had something come up. But as the days passed, and then over a week passed, and everyone was starting to get nervous. They eventually found out that Sam… passed away, in his room. He overworked himself to the point of exhaustion and his body just couldn’t take it anymore. Sam passed in winter, 2022 alone in his bedroom. I… I miss him. I miss him a whole lot. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if he was still here. Would we watch the people in the hospital together? What about the cats basking in the sun in the apartment? What would he say about the couple laying in bed together, still together after all these years… 



It gets hard sometimes, not having Sam around anymore. His co-workers felt the impact of Sam’s absence too. They stopped sitting together on the jib. They stopped hanging out and joking. The air felt heavy and thick, and everyone had their heads down. It was clear the kind of effect that Sam had left. Things have never been the same since. But as they say, life goes on, right? Everyone eventually picked up their feet and got back into the groove after a few months. But for me… I stayed here, just waiting for Sam to come back. It’s foolish and stupid, I know, you don’t have to tell me, but I can’t help it. Sam was my best friend. Nobody has operated me since Sam’s passing. I’ve been stuck here since 2022. In fact, nobody has sat in that cabin since Sam… except for you. Hm. Interesting. 



“Terex, you mentioned that this building you’re positioned on right now is an office building. Is it…?”



Is it the same office building Sam and I were supposed to complete? Yes. It is… you’re perceptive. It’s also why winters get so lonely. Not because I can barely be used in the winter but rather because winter is when we lost Sam. But, if it lightens the mood a bit, I’ll let you know that this is the warmest winter that I have had in a couple of years. Why? Because you’re here. Thank you, for keeping me company, and thank you for listening to me ramble on like this. 

The snow looks a little bit brighter tonight, doesn’t it?

1hn8eb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaphysicalWeather/comments/1hn8eb0/winter_day_6_christmas_day_walk/,Winter Day 6: Christmas Day Walk,"Christmas happened in April this year – I walk outside, expect the sycamores to start sprouting before they finish dropping leaves – leaves knotted in the canopy here and there like spittle at the corners of the mouth. The streets and sidewalks are wet, and as I walk, the rain comes and goes like the volume of something, which it is, but also as in sound rising and falling. The trees have me feeling like we tread among the ancients, we and our upstart civilization. I find myself dwelling on the late paleolithic – the era we dwell in now, plus in my own life, when I managed a commercial grocery after school and weekends. An experience of adulthood, based on a new tier of economic participation. Competence as a means of access to the world of adulthood – I was having surreal conversations with people 2-3x my age, about equity, real estate, sexuality.

Someone vandalized the sign out front – the place where we hang promotions and self-identify – the old glass nameplate for the subterranean vegan restaurant underneath the peace church was broken and taken. You can see a bare bulb in the display case now. Posters and manifestos were also removed – there’s hardly anything left, like we’ve been looted. A sign of the times – when a peace church that actively rebukes war should be targeted for trouble. Let it be known, among the nefarious and not keen to get caught – you earn no political points for taking swings at peace churches, considerable deductions if you connect. If peace churches become the site of violence, we should well start ringing all the bells that can ring, everywhere at once, agree to take to the streets collectively when the bells begin to ring. I make a note of the time, carry on.

Across the street, into the commons area, I’m walking through the sort of mild day that should be the occasion for celebration. Instead, among the few people I see – Asian students, keeping routines – the environment seems populated by intellectual refugees – kids 10K km from home and lonely over the holidays because transpacific airline tickets aren’t cheap. Literally everyone I see seems to be telling some version of this story but me, and then I get it – and me – and so I feel a kinship with 19-year-olds and their backpack plushies swinging behind them, out of place color palettes on their coats and pants. Walking to the north, I see a possible houseless person leaning against a wall, with a backpack or bedroll. I practice invitations to talk, practice smiling, at some point realize the guy is really an electric scooter plus a sheet of plastic caught in a tree.

Around the corner, I walk through a sort of breeze way west that passes beneath a lot of really old trees. The mild temperature and wetness confers a fundamental promise, and I stand there listening to it for a bit. Within seconds, squirrels come down to the ground and approach me – three then a fourth, each one stepping right up to the cuff of my pants, on the verge of tugging at it, I realize a more virtuous person than myself must have habitually fed the squirrels at this time of day, a bag of popcorn or something. Each of the squirrels has that look of one who sees something inside of me I don’t see in myself, courageous enough to step right up, one by one, making the same plea – brother, can you help me through this? I weigh the possibility that one of them might climb up the side of my body to get closer to my face. I am not literally a tree –

I hope they know this. I picture four staple removers racing up my body, searching for popcorn or hickory nuts. They all turn around peacefully, patrolling the area with their noses, searching for odors of germination, where the nut will have brewed up the most living sort of taste, a nut standing for the feast of the season’s culmination. Earlier this week, I received a walnut gift left on the concrete just before the east-side door of the peace church. There are no walnut trees on the property, none in the neighborhood in fact, but here was a black walnut, with a careful hole in the shell chewed away by the squirrel that left it there, such that I could clearly see the sweet germ of the walnut inside – it broke open the nut and left it for me to find. I admit I have been leaving food stuffs for the squirrels – I fret about their access to food at this time of year.

The president is playing the board game Risk in his head when he talks about Canada, Panama and Greenland of all places – he’s thinking about the so-called territories he needs to control to maintain security in North America, which earns the player five additional tokens per round. As board games go, Risk is obsessed with hegemony – the game only ends when everything in the world is controlled by a single player. When we used to play the game with actual dice, five or six competitive players, the final showdown could last fifteen minutes or more, with the player on the losing side being pressured to concede. Pedagogy of the Oppressed comes to mind, and I refute the banking model in deference to the critical act of problematizing one’s environment. Maybe the mystery squirrel benefactor used wavy potato chips. Maybe peanut butter pretzels.

I head to the south, consider the experimental results of group mindedness among carrier ants. Of the estimated 20,000 to 40,000 ant species, an estimated 1% are carrier ants, meaning they engage in coordinated behavior to carry large objects back to the hive. In a recent experiment, an oddly shaped capital letter I was dosed with an odor synonymous with a choice food treat, a bit of muffin or a daub of custard – something the ants would go crazy to drag back to the hive. The I-ish object must be negotiated around two obstructions that require spinning the object between walls – a problem requiring a solution. I picture a human 3-year-old solving a problem like this. The ants can do it, too – the video demonstrates them solving the problem, not with a sense of chaos but as deliberate as a singular mind, fluent at moving food around obstructions.

A mind can so completely transcend its circumstance, it is no longer recognizable to any of the principals involved. A metaphysical authority can arise from our intentions – this is what carrier ants are telling us. If the researchers employed a series of differently shaped courses against a series of differently shaped movable feasts, observed how the ants solved the problem without knowing anything about the shape as shape, the obstacles as obstacles, yet still arrived at the right conclusions – would they be able to assign individual psychological profiles to the species? Could they train a species to play tetris against a computer? Could they solve a rubik’s cube? A carrier ant chess league might be in the offing, hives competing regionally for the right to go to nationals, winning hive squaring off against Magnus himself, should he have the stamina for it. 

They’re near to completing the main structure of the residential adjunct to the local Lutheran church – seven stories, rough concrete poured for each of the upper six, a ground floor still dirt poor, earth moving equipment parked inside it. The white plastic sheets covering the insulation remind me of table coverings. Window sets are in the process of being fitted from left to right, like data being uploaded to a chart, everyone who will ever live there merely an observer of it – does this inspire hope or despair? I am seeing evidence of a project – funds were amassed, and cost-benefit analyses were approved by a bank, and an order of operations based on local and global supply chains was laid out, the subject of contract law after that, plus the vagaries of life as it is when cooperation is needed. A spacious wooden deck occupies a corner of the top floor.

Do Lutherans believe in penthouses? I spend a moment imagining myself living up there – free place to live, where I might take in the sunrise with a cup of hot coffee, oversee the world-class university buzzing below. Oh hive mind trying to carry the oddly shaped present into the future around obstacles unnamed – I’ll try my best to shout out hints while I can. A gantry runs up one side of the building, and a tower crane rests atop the building itself. I picture it lifting the HVAC equipment to the roof eventually, before launch can commence. A tall light post on the corner is noticeably leaning away from the new construction, like it knows its days are numbered, and something is bound to take its place. The light post was designed like a 19th century pole for oil lamps, so in a way it was satirizing its own obsolescence. Someday there will be no public light.

I return from my walk, decide to bag up some leaves before I head inside. Leaves have piled up under two of the four picnic tables in a way that implied a ratio, a deal in the works, and I drew them out from under the tables with a green rake made of flexible aluminum tines, first on the one side, then the other, then I stuffed great wads of leaves into a big brown lawn bag. Wetted leaves are especially good at clumping together, so I took up a boulder-sized bunch from a pile, stuffed them perfectly in the bag, the bag filling out like a mail bag at Christmas – the way they are depicted in twentieth century media at least, at least that. I cram two bags with the last of the leaves at the peace church, what’s left in the sycamores left to the wind. This is Christmas, I utter to myself, gaze in all directions – empty streets. Joy must be interior, I think, head inside.",1,1735279145.0,MetaphysicalWeather,0,1.0,False

1hn8cky,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hn8cky/my_32f_husband_35m_didnt_tell_me_where_he_got_our/,My (32F) Husband (35M) didnt tell me where he got our Daughter's (7F) name--how do I approach this?,"I'm just not sure how to feel about this, so I thought I'd check myself by hearing some other opinions on the matter before I ""confront"" him. Been really conflicted for the last few hours.

Up until now, me and my Husband have had a great relationship. Almost picture perfect. We met at a Coffee Shop--I worked there, he would come in every day and tuck himself away in a corner and do work on his laptop. Very polite, soft spoken, quiet man. Dressed in very simple, plain clothes and his hair was always very messy in a way I found very cute. I'd try to make small talk after he became a regular, but he wasnt very reciprocative--he'd answer questions and smile, but wouldn't do anything to further conversations. I was very surprised when he asked me out one morning after nearly two years of me first seeing him there, but I said yes and we really hit it off. He was a better talker on dates, and though he was a little odd, I really appreciated a lot of his oddities. He was very no-nonsense and blunt, but not in a rude way.

Early on in the relationship, he told me that he had no desire to hear about or know about any past relationships I had had, didnt care how many there may have been, just didnt want to hear about them, and asked the same courtesy be extended to him. It was a little strange, and I teased him a little about if he was jealous or if he had tons of exes, but he just said something like ""I dont see how any good would come from that topic of conversation and would prefer we dont waste our time on it"" (He always talks like that) so I shrugged it off and agreed. Ive always been curious since, and I tried to sneakily prod for info on past relationships now and again, but he's impossible to trick into saying things without thinking, so eventually I gave up. There was a few other 'rules' like that he requested early on. Didnt want to be asked about his family--""If I dont introduce a family member to you, they arent worth knowing about"". Didnt want me to ask about his work--""I'm not a criminal, government employee, secretely rich, or involved in anything nefarious or perturbing."" (Eventually told me he's an author, just very uncomfortable about people he knows reading his work. Publishes under a different name to avoid people knowing who he is, etc.. etc.. Doesn't write anything weird, so I don't really know why.). Basically, he just didnt like being poked and prodded about personal things. These requests werent an issue for me, but they always lingered in my mind.

Well, after about a year of dating, we got ""unlucky"" and, despite me being on birth control and him always wearing protection, I became pregnant. It was very scary for me, but when I went to him, he was just as calm as always. He made sure I was okay, hugged me, sat me down, and told me he loved me--the first time he said it. Held my hand, and asked me what I wanted to do. I was so scared at the time, and I didnt know what I wanted, so I asked him what he wanted. He said ""Kids are nice. We should have time to get married and get a house before its born. It's up to you."" He said it as if he was talking about what the weather was going to be next week, and I laughed. We spent the next two weeks making the final decision, but ultimately we ended up married with a beautiful, perfect little baby girl. My husband was never a 'cold' person, but after she was born he became so much warmer. Always wanted to be involved with her, never shyed about from the less glamorous parts of raising a baby, spent as much time with her as possible--I have an albums worth of pictures of him sitting at his computer with her on his lap while he writes. 

We've since had two more kids, a son (3M) and another little girl (1F), and things have been great. I look back at our entire relationship and I feel so fortunate that this is the life I ended up with. I really mean that--which is why Ive been struggling so much with this new development.

This all came about because today, my Husband had some friends over. A good group of guys he has known since Elementary and High School. I've met all their girlfriends and wives, been to some of their weddings, etc.. Several times a year, we'll all get together for a barbeque, usually at our house, and its always nice because my Husband really opens up around them. Laughs more, tells jokes, gushes about our kids--its really sweet. I've become good friends with their partners, as well. This has worked out especially nicely, because once every month or two for the last four or five years, my Husband likes to get together with his friends for a ""guys night"". They play cards, talk, that sort of thing. Their girlfriends/wives and I got kind of jealous of being left out after a while, though, so we decided to start doing a ""girls night"" too, meeting at one of their houses the same night. Its been really fun.

Tonight was one such night. My Husband had the guys over to our house this time, and I went to one of their wives houses with the other girls. I brought the two youngins with me, but our oldest stayed behind with her Dad like usual, always the Daddy's girl. About an hour into the night, though, I got a really bad migrain. Tried to wait it out, laid down for a bit, but eventually decided I had to call it a night and went home early. Walked in the door and found my Husband with our daughter asleep in his arms while he and his friends chatted away around the table. I told him what happened, and he was going to call the night early to take care of me, but I assured him I was okay and would just go to bed early after putting the youngins down.

Well, after I did so, I snuck down to get a glass of water, not wanting to interrupt them again. As I was going back upstairs, though, I hung back for a moment just to listen in on them as they talked. I dont really know why I did this--I'm not super nosy, I was just curious what he talked about when Im not around. I ended up standing there for a half hour, just listening. It was nice--he was a little more casual, less carefully articulated, even heard him cuss a few times, which he has never ever done around me in the decade Ive known him. It was really nice to get a glimpse of that side of him. At one point, the conversation shifted to our oldest daughter--none of his friends have kids over 3, so one of them asked how it is raising a girl that age. He gushed about her like he always does, how good she is doing in school, how talented she is, etc.. The guys teased him about it, and they all laughed. Then, his best friend asked him if he had told me who he had named our daughter after.

This caught my attention, because he had never said she was named after anyone. He had simply asked me several months into the pregnancy how I felt about the name ""Lily"" (not her real name) if it was a girl. I really liked it, so it ended up sticking when we found out it was going to be a girl, and that was that--until now.

My husband sighed really heavily and didnt say anything for a few seconds, then said something along the lines of ""I'm worried to tell her at this point. I suggested the name without thinking of the implications and she really liked it, and now.. I dont want her to get the wrong idea."" to which his friend replied ""I think it would be okay if you just sat her down and were honest with her. If you named her after an ex, that would be crazy, but.. I mean, I think its different. She's not really an ex if she passed away while you were dating, right?""

I think you can imagine how thrown for a loop I was. I knew immediately I had heard something I shouldnt have. My heart sunk in my chest and I quickly went back upstairs, but the damage was done. I've been sitting here for the last two hours just at a loss of what to do. He came up while I was typing this to put Lily to bed and check on me, and I felt so.. I could hardly speak to him. 

I am so, so lost on what I'm supposed to do and how I feel. We have never, ever had any secrets in our relationship outside the ""taboo"" topics of conversation. Ive respected his boundries and he has respected mine, but I dont know where this falls. He named our Daughter after a girl he dated who passed away, and he never told me? Not about the name, nor that that had happened to him--how could he just keep that to himself?

I really dont know how to approach this. Part of me is angry he didnt tell me, but I'm also so, so, so heartbroken at the thought that he went through that, and it so horrible, but theres also a part of me thats.. I dont know, jealous? The idea that theres another woman that still has a piece of his heart just.. It makes me upset, even if she's passed away. I know thats a terrible thing to say. The fact that our daughter has her name now, does he think of this woman every time he hears it? 

I dont know what Im supposed to do. I know I cant keep this from him--he is going to know something is wrong tomorrow. Nothing gets by him. But aside from all my feelings, I feel really awful for eavesdropping, too, and to overhear that.. I guess it makes sense why he didnt want to talk about past relationships now.

I apologize for being so wordy, I'm just beside myself trying to work through all of this. I dont even know what kind of advice I'm looking for--am I awful for feeling jealous? Is it terrible that he kept this from me? How can I bring this up to him? I'm not angry, really, I just don't know what to do or how to broach this subject. This is so far beyond anything I've ever had to deal with, and I dont want to overreact or be insensative, but I deffinitely feel like he should have told me this.",4,1735278963.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

**AIW for expecting my husband to shovel snow ( not me)?**

Throw away account as my husband is an active redditor

I (F, 26) have been with my husband (M, 37) for 5 years, married for 2. I’m currently pregnant (about 5 months). I’m a nurse and sometimes work night shifts. Usually, I come home, we eat breakfast together, then he goes to work, and I sleep.

We had a big dump of snow last night. In our building, each unit is responsible for shoveling. Our strata has a set schedule, and the shoveling is supposed to be done before 8 AM and again before 5 PM. They send us multiple notifications, so there’s no surprise.

When I came home early this morning, I saw that my husband was still sleeping and no shoveling had been done. I woke him up and asked him to shovel . He said he was too tired because he worked late last night and went back to sleep.

I asked him two more times within 5 minutes, but he kept saying he was tired. Finally, he asked me if I could do it this time, saying he would be so grateful. I told him I was also tired because I’d just come home from work, but I agreed and asked him to make breakfast while I was out. He said okay.

It took me a while, but I shoveled the whole area. When I came back inside, I found him still sleeping. I started yelling at him, and he said, “I told you I was tired! .”

I told him that next time, I wouldn’t do the shoveling, and I’d let strata fine us instead. He got mad and said it was for the house, that I live here too, and that I was making a big deal out of it. He left, and now I’m so angry!

Am I overreacting, or was he being a selfish jerk?

Added later : his argument was that I was gonna sleep all day anyways and I was already awake while I work during the day so “what’s the big deal?”..

Added later 2: we live in Canada . We had 15 cm of snow last night ..

Added later 3- yes ! He does had ADHD ( diagnosed as a teen ), and has terrible time management

**dognocat**

*That's a real dick move, getting your 5 month pregnant wife to shovel snow. you're not wrong I'm all for equality and sharing household tasks, but you're pregnant for effs sake and just finished work to cap that off.*

**Fairmount1955**

*For real. As much as people mistakenly say shoveling is good exercise, it's also dangerous.  Wild a bro would be so casual about risking harm to his wife and kid....*

**schirmyver**

*You are 5 mo pregnant.... You are not wrong and he's a lazy inconsiderate ass. What if you slipped and fell while shoveling? I've been married for 30+ years and have never asked my wife to shovel. She has come out and helped me a few times when it is really deep and heavy, but I take care of it.*

*Is this your first child? I worry how much he's going to help you once your child is born.*

>OOP: Yes this is our first baby. We have been together since I was in university ( I was 21) . We got married 2 years ago

**Minimum-Guidance7156**

*So let me get this straight, a 32 year old dude decided a 21 year old girl in college was his forever wife or an easy target to manipulate? Because no sane adult with a developed brain goes after someone without one. And this is NOT a single slight to you OP. You were 21, and he was old enough to know better. Just like at nearly 40 he should understand the dangers of forcing his first time pregnant wife to shovel snow after a long shift of taking care of people without food and nutrition after all of that work so her should be ex gets to sleep like a baby.*

**MamaBearonhercouch**

*You aren't answering what's already been asked: What did your lazy ass husband do before you moved in and took over everything? Did he live in his own filth with an empty refrigerator?*

*Neurodivergence doesn't give him a pass on taking part in doing the adulting for his household. If he has problems with being an adult, there are therapists who specialize in dealing with neurodivergent people. He can learn better time management. He can learn to understand a proper division of chores. He can learn that there are things he needs to take over because you're pregnant.*

*You need to stop making excuses for him and expect him to take action to become a functioning adult. Please - there are neurodivergent people in every profession on this planet, and they SUCCEED in those professions. You're married to a man-child who doesn't even want to succeed at being a responsible husband.*

*Put the bar higher and expect him to get over it. If you don't, you're going to be doing 100% of the household chores and 100% of the childcare chores, and you'll still be making excuses that he can't help because ""he's neurodivergent and that's a disability."" No, it isn't. Now pull up your big girl panties and hold his feet to the fire.*

>OOP: My apologies I missed it. When we were FWB he was coming over to my place . When we started dating he said he was cleaning his house and everything before I come over . He had one serious ex before me but they never lived together ( dated in college then she moved they did long distance and eventually broke up). We moved in together after we got engaged. I just assumed because he has demanding job he is just focused on it and it’s gonna get better eventually. Then we talked to our family dr changed his meds he got better . I started adding stuff to do on his calendar , making him task list every night and texting to him so he can follow the next day ,.. so many other things .. everything works initially then back to square one

>Well I can’t ask him that because our dr said do you tell a paralyzed man to get over it and walk ? No he can’t but you can give him a wheelchair to move around and be productive , so support him and help him find what works for him and love him the way he is .

**L---K----**

*You're going to have to make your stands now. If you don't , you can expect it to be worse when the baby is here. He should've shoveled. You're 5 months pregnant and just got off working a high demand job. Does he care about your rest and the health of the baby ? Or is he as selfish and entitled as this post makes it out to be.*

>OOP: Yes he normally does care a lot. He is just terrible about any deadline . I asked him to set up the crime we bought on Black Friday . He kept saying he will do it next weekend . Then I reminded him next weekend he said omg so sorry you are right ! I’ll it after I clean up the my work room. Then half way through cleaning his work room he got distracted reading some old book. It’s Christmas Eve his work room is still a mess and crib is in the box still. He said he will do everything by the weekend . We will see.

**Minimum-Guidance7156**

*OP I am severely ADHD like this, if I’m with people shopping expect lose me multiple times. If I need to complete one household task, I’m going to be doing at least 15 others along the way. I did this a lot as teenager and I had to learn coping mechanisms then to outgrow being so consumed by one task. Unfortunately more trauma ensued and now I have a lovely (untrained, so she stays home) service dog that happily distracts me when the hyper focus is too long, lays on me when the anxiety is bad, and literally remind me to be on a schedule. It’s not her responsibility to make sure I do my dailies, but she’s sure helps remind me to get in gear and get it done. I understand where your husband is coming from, but he’s 37 and old enough to know that these are very unhealthy habits he should have started to unlearn years ago. It would be fine if he was single and lived alone. But he has a wife and baby at home with responsibilities that need to be done.*

**Update - 1 day later**

Not an actual update. Hi, I’m Matty—the husband of the pregnant lady who shoveled snow yesterday. My wife showed me the post, and at first, I was really upset because she shared our private argument online to get validation. But then I asked if I could share my side, and she let me use her phone to post. She’s getting ready to head to my parents’ place for Christmas day together , and I’m bored, so here I am.

First off, yes I have ADHD ( medicated ) but my wife forgot to mention a few things: she has OCD ( not diagnosed). She needs everything cleaned, organized, and done right now. She can’t just leave a task for later—it’s not in her nature. I told her I’d shovel soon, but she wanted it done immediately. I get it, before 8 AM and all that, but we still had time. She kept reminding me, and finally, I said, “If you’re in such a rush, you can do it. I’d actually be grateful.” She said okay.

Yes, I forgot to make her coffee and toast, but I would’ve done it if she had just sat down and chilled. She didn’t. She wanted everything done now, like usual.

Also, I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been on meds since July—right around when I started working with a new team. My sleep schedule is a mess, and I was tired.

To everyone suggesting “exit plans,” thanks, but we talked it out. We both apologized. I said sorry for letting her down, and she promised not to shovel anymore. She also apologized for yelling at me and calling me a selfish, lazy prick.

Oh, and to the people calling me a groomer? That’s disgusting. You’re infantilizing my wife, and it’s gross.

Happy holidays, bye.

*Appreciate taking the time to put your side, but really, you’ve got no excuse. I’ve missed what time the conversation occurred, but I don’t think it was 4/5am… more like 7.30am.. You didn’t have time. You let your pregnant wife come off a night shift and shovel snow because you couldn’t arsed. It then didn’t occur to you to even make her some breakfast while she was out there cold, exerting herself in treacherous conditions, again because you couldn’t be arsed. You’d had the night to sleep. You should try growing a human and then you’d know what tired is. I feel sorry for your wife once this baby comes as I fear she’ll be doing a lot alone…*

**Initial\_Dish6682**

*There is nothing ocd about getting snow shoveled because it has to be done at a particuliar* [*time.You*](http://time.You) *know this and could had set an alarm to go out and do it.still the ass*

**TipsyBaker\_**

*Ok but it sounds like the apartments says it needs done by 8, not your wife, and you know that. Shoveling snow isn't a chore someone should be doing while pregnant, people die each year doing that task so why risk it? You're about to have a baby. You can't do whatever you want whenever you feel like it any more. Not if you want to keep relationships with your wife and your child.Your ADHD is your responsibility to address and it's not a crutchor excuse, so get on it.*

>OOP: Yes but I would have done it eventually before 8. My wife wants stuff to be done right away. She can’t just sit down and chill and let me figure shit up myself. That’s my point

**Minimum-Guidance7156**

*How’s that crib bought in Black Friday coming along, OP’s nearly 40 year old husband? Why are you infantilizing yourself? You know how to open a box and start a project. You need to open your eyes see what you’re doing. You and your wife literally not figuratively because we spoke, believe that she is your secretary. She’s your wife and this is your household. If she wants it done now it’s because you REFUSE to finish the task so she’s making sure you complete jt. You are a selfish lazy prick. I never told her to leave you or suggested it, but let’s be honest, forcing your pregnant wife to shovel snow and you promise her breakfast only for you to SLEEP instead? You don’t care about her or your kid and prioritize yourself pretty clearly.*

*Edit: since you have seen my comments OP, you know your wife and I spoke. Check her DM’s and read that link I sent her that made her so emotional from the relatability that it made her cry. For anyone else wondering* [*https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/*](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/)

>OOP: Ouch she mentioned the crib too ! Great ! More sharing private conversations . I’m gonna do it soon! It’s in my to do list . I still have time she is not even close to giving birth! Chill

**Late\_Education\_6224**

*Honestly, this doesn’t make you look any better. You’re admitting that you had your wife who is 5 months pregnant out shoveling snow after a long shift? Then you went back to sleep instead of making food for her and your unborn baby. We all have issues, but bottom line is you have responsibilities and pushed them off on your pregnant wife. You have a baby on the way, it’s time to get it together.*

**accidentally-cool**

*No, you don't understand! He's tired! He has depression! You have to know HE IS A PRIORITY, TOO! I rolled my eyes so far back in my head at this post*

I've yet to actually get a response from anyone on this sub so thought l'd go ahead and make my own post and see if my luck changes
Looking for my other half who is also someone I would consider to be my best friend.

I am in Las Vegas hispanic (both my parents are Mexican but I was born in the states, San Diego) 5'9"", 220lbs, brown eyes, No tattoos nor piercings (it's fine to me if you do, but those aren't things I want for myself).

I rarely drink, I don't smoke, I don't vape, and I don't do drugs. Tried them once or twice but never again. I can handle it if you drink so long as it is infrequent or for special occasions or something, but smoking, vaping, and drugs are absolute deal breakers.

Spent most of my 20s working a lot of jobs. I was trying to figure what I wanted and what I can be good for. Worked in construction, restaurants, coffee shops, welding, handyman, auto mechanic, school teacher, office jobs. I’m glad I did all of that because I learned just about anything in any field. 

I used to work on a ship for national geographic as a sous chef. I made breads, deserts, appetizers, crew meals. It’s more of a fill in job. I do have a fulltime job at another ship. Doing the exact same thing. I love it because I get to travel a lot and save a lot of money on rent and bills. 
Since I work on ships I’m almost never in Vegas. I’m always somewhere else. Either in San Diego or in Mexico with my parents. I do work 6 weeks on and 6 weeks off. So dating for me is hard, I understand many can’t do that. And that’s ok.

I am a dual Mexican/American citizenship. I am currently buying a house in Mexico with my parents. I plan to start up my own family style restaurant/ coffee shop in Mexico.
I do go to Mexico often because that’s where my parents live I go about 3-4 times a year. They can’t come to the US. So that’s like an important thing for me. 

I'm not too picky or into much about music, but mostly right now I listen to techno or Hans Zimmerman soundtracks. 

I listen to podcasts, usually educational or self improvement type stuff... usually as something to do while l'm out alone on a walk.

I do want kids/ family one day. 

I do ask you to be honest. For example If there’s something you don’t like about me, tell me and we can solve that problem. Vice versa. I’m not here to play games or anything. I just want to have a partner that is willing to go on trips with me and have a good time. 

I’m a very active person, hobby wise I like to go on hikes, and biking, I also like to go camping. I like to drive very far and go to new cities or parks and just explore and see what’s new to me. And photograph mountains, beaches, sunsets.
I have like 4 cameras so I really like to take photos of everything, even though I still forget to take them. I’m just enjoying the moment haha

Before I worked on a ship, about 2 years ago. I wanted to know more of my body, basically what it could handle. What I mean is I went vegan for 7 months and I lost 60lbs. I also sold my car and I was riding my bike 20-30miles a day. I also fasted a lot. Most I ever did was 5 days. It may not be super interesting but for me it was like a life changing time for me. 

I’m not really into politics, if I had to consider which way I’m leaning would be more on the right. I also believe in God. But I’m open to anyone. I have friends on both sides and atheists who are really close and good friends to me. 
we can go into deep into my views I’m sure it’ll be interesting.

I think I'm pretty funny and sarcastic, though I don't think that's really showing here... come chat with me though and maybe we will see

I am pretty introverted but I’m not a shy person. I only say what I need or want to say. I don’t talk just to talk. And I listen more than I talk. So if you’re someone who talks a lot I don’t mind that. I also like learning from other people. 
I open up a lot more the more comfortable I get.

I’m not really picky but I prefer someone 21-35, no kids, white, Hispanic, Asian someone who lives in the US or Europe, I’d love to go to Europe. 

If you've gotten this far, thank you & leave your age and location in your response, and a bit about you... let's see if we get along.

","While I was browsing in a popular home furnishing store in Pasay City. I saw a Caucasian man in his late 60s looking at frying pans. Behind him were three young boys with brown skin, around 8–10 years old. The Caucasian man was wearing cargo shorts, a polo shirt, and a fisherman’s vest, and he smelled awful—clearly not using deodorant or bathing regularly.

I was looking for a cooking-related gift for someone, but I felt something was off. Two of the boys were busy on their phones watching something, while the other one was scanning the surroundings. I overheard one of them tell them ""tumakbo na tayo hindi naman niya tayo mahababol"" but another replied, “magagalit mga mama natin kasi nabayaran na sila baka sapakin tayo.""

I left, unsure whether I should tell the guard to call the police or just mind my own business. I decided to leave and get coffee instead, but the incident bothered me. I called a friend of mine who’s a police officer at the NCRPO and told him what I saw. He said it would be hard to establish anything immediately based on what I overheard. It’s painful to admit, but the process is slow, and there are factors that could lead to immediate denial, especially if the parents are involved.

Until now, I feel sorry for the boys if my instincts were right. They were simply dressed in shorts, shirts, and slippers. I feel guilty that I couldn’t do anything…",13,1735278260.0,OffMyChestPH,3,1.0,False

1hn85c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisdomcollective/comments/1hn85c3/the_science_of_happiness_exploring_what_truly/,The Science of Happiness: Exploring What Truly Makes Us Happy,"Happiness is something everyone seeks, but what truly makes us happy? Is it wealth, success, or relationships? The science of happiness dives deep into these questions, offering insights from psychology, neuroscience, and sociology. Understanding happiness is not only about pursuing fleeting pleasures but finding deeper, more lasting fulfillment.

**What is Happiness?**

At its core, happiness is a feeling of well-being and contentment. Yet, for many, it's often elusive. Researchers differentiate between two types of happiness: *hedonic happiness* and *eudaimonic happiness*. Hedonic happiness refers to pleasure and enjoyment, like indulging in a favorite meal or spending time on a hobby. Eudaimonic happiness, on the other hand, is about living a meaningful life—finding purpose, contributing to society, and aligning your actions with your values.

Psychologist Martin Seligman, a pioneer in positive psychology, defines happiness as a combination of positive emotions, engagement, and a sense of accomplishment. According to his research, the happiest people are those who nurture their relationships, have a sense of purpose, and engage deeply with life.

**The Neuroscience of Happiness**

The brain plays a critical role in our perception of happiness. Neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins are the chemical messengers responsible for feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. Dopamine, for example, is often referred to as the ""feel-good"" neurotransmitter, activated when we accomplish a goal or experience something rewarding. Serotonin, which influences mood, is associated with feelings of contentment and stability. When these chemicals are balanced, we experience lasting happiness.

However, the brain is also wired to adapt quickly to positive changes. This is known as the ""hedonic treadmill."" When we achieve something or acquire something we desire—like a new car or a promotion—our happiness increases temporarily but soon returns to baseline levels. Understanding this phenomenon helps explain why chasing material possessions or external success alone doesn’t lead to long-term happiness.

**What Truly Makes Us Happy?**

1. **Strong Relationships** Research consistently shows that the most significant predictor of happiness is the quality of our relationships. Family, friends, and close connections provide emotional support, a sense of belonging, and joy. One personal experience stands out: I’ve always valued time spent with loved ones, but after a particularly tough year, I realized how crucial those moments of connection were to my happiness. Even simple activities, like cooking dinner together or sharing a walk, became sources of deep contentment. Studies show that social connections are more powerful in promoting happiness than any other factor.
2. **Gratitude and Positive Thinking** Practicing gratitude can have a profound impact on happiness. Keeping a gratitude journal, where you write down three things you're thankful for each day, can help shift your mindset from scarcity to abundance. A few years ago, I began a daily gratitude practice, and it completely transformed my outlook on life. I started to appreciate the small things—morning coffee, a smile from a stranger, or a quiet evening at home. Research supports this, indicating that focusing on positive aspects of life helps people feel happier and more resilient.
3. **Meaningful Work and Purpose** Eudaimonic happiness, or the pursuit of meaning, is another key contributor to long-term happiness. Having a sense of purpose, whether through work, hobbies, or volunteerism, provides a deeper satisfaction that isn’t tied to external rewards. Personally, finding purpose through my work and creative endeavors has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my life. It’s not always about the outcome, but the sense of contributing to something greater than oneself.
4. **Mindfulness and Living in the Moment** Mindfulness—the practice of being fully present in the moment—has been shown to reduce stress and increase happiness. I recall a time when I was constantly distracted, racing through tasks without fully appreciating the experience. After incorporating mindfulness into my daily routine, I began to notice a shift. I became more present with my family, more appreciative of nature, and found joy in simple moments. Studies have shown that mindfulness practices can enhance emotional regulation and overall well-being.

Happiness is not a one-size-fits-all experience, and it’s not something we can buy or achieve through success alone. It’s about nurturing relationships, practicing gratitude, finding purpose, and living in the moment.

Our moms knew one another and she moved to my area near high school. I was 16 and she was 14, (ex I was a junior she was a sophomore when she should be with the freshmen due to how her mom registered her for school as a kid). 

As a 16 year old I didn’t really party or ever try substances and some of the friends I had started to do that so we grew apart. I naturally got close with my best friend. We stayed close until college. When she suddenly just changed a lot, she now cared a lot about having a boyfriend and was never telling me what was going on in her life. I felt really left out. She also kept it a secret when she had other plans. Ex: we made plans for Friday, she’d tell me Friday morning she actually has plans with others. 



Also when we hung out it used to be more fun and stuff, I figured college is busy but she’d seemingly only hang out with me for 40 min, we’d walk and talk. And then she’d go. It was like clockwork and I didn’t really hang out with her that often anyway. I tried so hard to ask about herself. Wouldn’t tell me. Randomly I was scrolling TikTok and found her account where she posts these blogs. And she’s trying to get views and stuff because she tells people to share. So I said oh it’s cool you do that. And she said she didn’t want to tell me because she knows I do that too.. but I got sad because I share these things with her and she shuts me out of her life. 


Also I asked her to go to the movies recently, she said no. I asked her if she wants to grab coffee, she said maybe. It’s like she doesn’t want to follow through.

I actually got this as a gift... someone who knows I love peanut butter! It appears to be a bit of a higher end brand as it's priced above the staples. 

First things first... it's runny. 

OK, I've had experience with peanut butter that doesn't use hydrogenated oils. That's fine. It needs a little stir. It's supposed to be ""better"", right? It says non-GMO. Pollinator friendly. That must ensure that they're really trying here...

Well, it tastes like... well, nothing. It's a little gritty. A little peanutty. But really, it feels oily. Mostly without flavor. That's because I found that the typical added salt, sugar and occasional molasses have been omitted. OK, it must strive to be a healthier, bougie brand. The kind people pick up at Whole Foods holding a $7 coffee. I can fuck with that, maybe. Sure...

So with the omitted ingredients, you're left with peanuts and... wtf? Palm oil. One of the trashiest oils on the market. A low rent, environmentally unsustainable product that, really, I've only found with any regularity in Dollar Store food. 

So we've ditched ALL the flavor and used an oil that is used as the primary component of biodiesel fuel. But that's not all. 

With all of this strange formulation, at least the peanut content has got to be top tier... right? No. This clearly CANNOT be marketed as peanut butter due to the slightly smaller ""spread"" underneath the words ""peanut butter"". It can't be peanut butter if it's less than 90% peanuts. It's just a ""spread"". Justin's is not even true peanut butter and it doesn't come with the bonus of being ""honey roasted"". 

So, not only does it have a reduced peanut content over commercial brands, it costs a bit more. Not only did it eliminate salt and sugar, but it effectively increased the crappy palm oil level to the point that it not only took over the place of those 2 other ingredients but it went FURTHER with it and disqualified this from even being a comparable product to budget-level Peter Pan. This has likely more oil than any PB on the market and it's not better for it. 

I don't understand the reason for this formulation. Maybe it's good for diabetics? Idk, is this keto friendly? But it's not delicious. And it's not peanut butter. It's a flavorless oily mess.

1hn7z0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hn7z0f/confused_about_how_to_move_forward_after_an/,"Confused about how to move forward after an amazing date, but then being friend-zoned","1 week ago Wednesday, I (25M) matched with this girl (23F) on Hinge. After matching, we texted nonstop for nearly 8 hours each day for two days straight. I know that sounds crazy, but the conversations were amazing, with no dry moments or awkward pauses. They were genuinely fluid. We talked about each other’s interests, goals, reasons for being on the app, our backgrounds, etc.—things that I would usually skim over and discuss further on a first date. To me, it was clear that we should meet up to see if we had that chemistry in person, so I asked her if she was free on Saturday. She responded, “Yes.”

**Saturday – The First Date:**

Saturday came, and I planned to take her to a nice coffee shop connected to a mall. It was my idea so she could feel a sense of safety. However, we ended up walking around the mall for about 8 hours without ever going to the coffee shop because we were so distracted and deep into conversation. I’ve never felt such a strong connection with a potential partner before. At no point did anything feel forced from either of us—time just flew by, and we were both surprised by how quickly it passed (which seemed like a good sign).

At one point, she asked if I was talking to anyone else. I said “No” (which was true), and she then showed me her phone, which had over 400 matches from just 2 days on Hinge. She had only texted one other person, but she openly admitted she wasn’t interested in them and was interested in me.

**The Conversation:**

Some things she brought up on the first date were deeper than I’d usually get into so early on—insecurities, sexual experiences, deep family issues, and even how many kids I wanted. She asked if I would be okay if she got an IUD (in hindsight, that was probably a red flag to bring up on a first date). She also joked about things like whose last name the kids would take. It was all a bit overwhelming, but I just went with the flow.

When we got onto the topic of exes, she mentioned her last partner. She said that he played her by admitting, “I got what I wanted,” and that she wasn’t sure if she was fully over him. She also mentioned that she still follows him on social media but doesn’t believe in blocking exes. I’m the same way, but I don’t think I would still follow my exes. I took it as a red flag, but didn’t say anything, just kept going with the conversation.

**End of the Night:**

Later, we ended up going to a steakhouse because it was the only place open at 11 PM nearby, and I had a good feeling about the night, so I didn’t mind. After dinner (yes, I paid), we went back to my car, and I surprised her with flowers. She almost teared up and said no guy had ever given her flowers. I kissed her on the cheek, but I didn’t want to make her feel uncomfortable or forced.

We then sat in the car and started talking about the second date. I told her I wanted to surprise her, and she seemed excited. She even said she couldn’t wait to tell her friends about me and asked if I’d tell my family. I thought that was a bit too forward and definitely way too soon, but in the moment, I was “love-blinded” and felt like she was “the one,” so I told her, “Yes.”

At the end of the night, we shared a long hug, locked eyes, and I asked if it would be okay to give her a kiss. She said she would prefer to wait until the second date, and I completely respected that. She asked me to text her when I got home (it was 4 AM by this point). She felt bad about the late hour and said she’d invite me upstairs but that her place was a mess. I told her it was fine and texted her when I got home to let her know I made it back safely.

**The Day After:**

The next morning, I texted her “Good morning,” which she told me was cute, but I noticed her response times started slowing down. She was leaving me on read for hours at a time, so I took the hint and gave her some space. I had a feeling something was off, and while I tend to overthink, I’m usually not wrong when I do.

In the afternoon, I was surprised to receive a massive message—over 800 words. She said she didn’t want to lead me on because she didn’t feel the “attraction.” She told me I was the nicest guy, that she liked me, but wasn’t sure if it could become a relationship. She said she would be willing to go on another date, but she couldn’t guarantee that it would turn into anything serious. She wanted us to see other people while we worked on the “attraction” as friends. She reassured me it wasn’t anything I did or how I looked.

**Her Message and My Response:**

Reading her message was tough. I took about an hour to respond, thanking her for her honesty and telling her I must have picked up the wrong signals. I explained that I have never befriended someone I have romantic feelings for, and that I’m not the type of person who dates multiple people at once. I stuck to my values and made it clear that I wasn’t interested in just being friends.

She responded with another long message saying she really wanted to make it work and suggested that we take some time to be friends and see if the attraction could grow. She told me I could take my time to figure it out and let her know when I was ready.

**The Christmas Day Message:**

Two days after her paragraph, on Christmas Day, I posted a picture of myself at the gym with a “Happy Holidays” caption. She messaged me saying, “You don’t need to be going to the gym for me. Your physical appearance had nothing to do with it. I think you’re cute, but the attraction is missing.” I found this a bit odd and told her that I wasn’t going to the gym for her. This experience had just sparked a desire in me to work on my confidence, and I had been meaning to go to the gym. It wasn’t for her, but she did give me the push to start.

**Where I Stand Now:**

It’s been 5 days since our last communication, and I’m still really confused about what to do next. In the past, if I’ve ever been friend-zoned, I would just move on. But in this case, I wanted to come here for advice.

People around me are telling me to cut things off completely. Others are saying to be friends with her and see if the attraction grows over time, and some suggest not to pursue a relationship but to just be friends. I do really like her—or maybe it’s the idea of her. I want to see where this could go, but I also know I’m not the type of guy who can be friends with someone I have romantic feelings for, especially if she starts dating someone else in the future.

The conversation ended with her agreeing to wait to hear from me about whether I’m ready to be friends.

**Looking for Advice:**

I’m really stuck on what to do. Should I try to be friends and see if the attraction grows, or should I move on? I’m not sure I can handle being just friends, especially if she ends up dating someone else in a few months.

Any advice would be really appreciated!

How can I cope with the guilt of being the reason he no longer has a family?,"My husband (27m) and I (23f) have been married since August of 2020. (We met right after I started my sophomore year of college at 18, and after multiple health issues & surgeries on top of COVID taking over the world, we fell in love fast and hard. Met to dating to engaged to married in less than a year, I planned our wedding in 6 weeks) At first, his family absolutely loved me. I used to brag about how I would NEVER have to worry about the toxic MIL stereotype when we got married. We had coffee dates & girls nights & everything. There were a few red flags sure, but everyone has them. I brushed them off for the most part, my husband didn't seem to mind so neither did I. Until things took a nasty turn.

We decided to start our family very shortly after our wedding. With family history of infertility and multiple chronic illnesses on my side, we knew we truly only had a few years if we wanted to have our own biological children. (Yes, we had multiple conversations about all of our options, we ultimately decided on what was best for us.

I've wanted to be a mom as long as I can remember. I've had a list of baby names on my phone since I was 12, as I'm sure most of you women can relate to.) We go 8 months with absolutely no luck, so I see my obgyn. They recommend us to a fertility clinic, and since we had so much family history of miscarriages and infertility, we were seen right away. When I tell you they did every single test in the book, I am not joking. They did a full genetic panel on both of us, an HSG on me, multiple procedures, thousands of needle pokes and blood tests, countless ultrasounds, and thousands of dollars.

To sum our infertility journey up: We ultimately tried for over 2 years, some time with the clinic and some without. 4 lUls - one worked but ended in a miscarriage. The rest failed. My health took over, landed me in the hospital multiple times, and made the decision for us. I cannot carry a child anytime soon, if ever. We decided 2 months before our daughter's due date that we would not be actively trying for children anymore. If a miracle happens, we'll be so happy. But if not, we love being auntie and uncle to our massive amount of children in our lives. It was a very hard decision, but ended up being for the best. My side of the family were really supportive. My mom & stepmom always made me feel loved even when I couldn't understand why my body was failing in the one place it's literally made for. His family, however, completely ignored us. Or worse, they would make passive aggressive comments about how husbands sister should be having kids first, how we're too young for kids, how ""it's all in gods timing"", ""everything happens for a reason"" when I miscarried our daughter, and the worst, silence.
My husband counted the messages that went unanswered, it was over a dozen. My procedures, horrible news good news, anything in between - just ignored.

June 2022 will forever be burned into my brain. I am very vocal on my social media about my beliefs, and when Roe v Wade was overturned, I made a post. I was so devastated at the thought of never having children (the threat it made to IVF which is our only option to conceive), and felt the need to speak my voice. Husband and I were staying with his parents due to an issue in our house, and when his mother saw my post, all hell broke loose.

She took my post and used it to throw in my husband's face some of the foulest things I have ever heard in my life. I will not go into details because it makes me want to puke, but know she told her only son that his life was worthless (yes, she used those words), and told him that his wife is going to cheat on him (because of my sexuality, I am Pan not that it matters to literally anyone, l've been committed to my husband since the day he asked me to be his girlfriend), and many other cruel things. I was present out of eyesight for half of the conversation, but left for work in the middle of it. I heard with my own ears these things she said to him.
He stood up for me, our marriage, our daughter, and our future children, and walked away. After they went to bed, at 1 am he went to the room we were staying, packed all of our stuff in the ca' and left. We have been shifting between low no contact since then. I have been no contact since that day, but my husband is low contact with his parents at the moment. 

Every decision regarding his family has been made by him. I know I will always be the wicked woman who 'stole precious husband from his family' in their eyes, and l've learned to cope with it, but it is really hard when family members keep contacting me after blocking them constantly. There is a family member I have blocked on multiple accounts, multiple times, who will not stop messaging me on my BUSINESS account. I have gotten an 18 (yes, eighteen) page digital letter from this person, multiple messages calling me pathetic and a loser, threatening to reach out to my family because ""no sane person would act like this"". I'm honestly just sick of it. My husband is a grown man, he makes his own decisions. I don't know what goes on in other people's marriages, but I do know that in mine, neither controls the other. We have complete open communication, and he is free to contact literally anyone he wants. I have actually pushed him a few times in the last 2 years to meet with his parents, and every time he says no. He is very firm in his boundaries, and I am so proud of him for that. He stood up for me to his family, and because of that he lost all of them. He is the best partner, he takes care of me and the house, and is active in my family. My family adores him, and welcomed him with open arms. 

Someone who used to be very close to him just had another baby. With my own stuff going on, I cannot handle it. I am so happy for them, but devastated for myself. I have had to grieve a future that never existed. Every day I wake up and for just a second I look for my baby, until reality hits in and my arms are empty. My husband is the same way, and is hurting as deep as I am. He is seeing a family he hasn't been a part of in over two years, and I cannot imagine the pain he is going through.
I guess what I need is advice. I know I will forever be the villain in their story, and l've come to terms with that, but the guilt of being the reason my husband doesn't have his family is something that eats at me in the dark of night.
How can I cope with this? I know it's something I just have to get over, and with time it will get easier, but grieving the loss of my husbands family while they're still alive has been one of the hardest things l've ever done. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for your time.

1hn7xsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BarndosAndCabins/comments/1hn7xsh/simple_barndo/,Simple Barndo,"The Benefits of Choosing a Simple Barndo for Your Next Home
-----------------------------------------------------------

Choosing a home is one of the most significant decisions you’ll ever make. If you are looking for a unique and practical option, consider a simple barndo. This type of home combines the charm of a barn with modern living space, making it a stylish yet functional choice. Here is why you should think about a simple barndo for your next home.

### Affordability

One of the best benefits of a simple barndo is its affordability. Traditional homes can come with hefty price tags due to land costs and construction fees. On the other hand, building a barndo often costs less, which means you can put your hard-earned money to better use.

### Speed of Construction

Building a simple barndo can be faster than constructing a typical home. Since barndominiums are made from metal or other durable materials, the building process often requires fewer steps. This speed means you can move into your new barndo sooner and start enjoying your new lifestyle.

### Low Maintenance

A simple barndo is typically low maintenance. Many barndos are made with materials that resist weather damage, which means fewer repairs and upkeep for you. Here are some features that contribute to their low maintenance:

- **Durable Materials:** Metal and steel structures can withstand harsh weather.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Good insulation options keep utility costs down.
- **Easy Cleaning:** Smooth surfaces require less effort to maintain.

### Customization Options

When you choose a simple barndo, you have endless possibilities for customization. Whether you want a cozy, rustic feel or a sleek, modern space, you can design your home according to your taste. Some popular customization ideas include:

- **Open Floor Plans:** Create spacious and airy interiors.
- **Large Windows:** Allow natural light to flood in.
- **Outdoor Spaces:** Add porches or decks for relaxation.

### Space and Functionality

Barndominiums are often more spacious than traditional homes. You can have multiple bedrooms, large living areas, and plenty of storage without feeling cramped. This open layout makes it easier to entertain guests and spend quality time with family. The versatility of a barndo allows for a perfect blend between living space and workspaces, perfect for those working from home or pursuing hobbies like crafting or woodworking.

### A Unique Aesthetic

If you’re tired of cookie-cutter homes, a simple barndo offers a unique aesthetic that stands out in any neighborhood. The rustic charm combined with modern design elements creates a warm and welcoming feel. This distinct style can also boost your property’s value, making it a wise investment.

### Eco-Friendly Options

For environmentally-conscious homebuyers, many barndominiums can be designed with eco-friendly features. Consider options like:

- **Solar Panels:** These reduce energy costs and promote sustainability.
- **Rainwater Harvesting:** Collecting rainwater can help with irrigation and reduce water costs.
- **Energy-Efficient Insulation:** Keeps your home comfortable with less energy usage.

### Connection to Nature

A simple barndo often sits on large plots of land, giving you a beautiful connection to nature. Imagine waking up to serene landscapes and fresh air every day. With more outdoor space, you can enjoy gardening, outdoor activities, or simply lounging under the stars in your backyard.

Choosing a simple barndo for your next home provides numerous benefits, from affordability and speed of construction to low maintenance and endless customization options. The unique aesthetic and eco-friendly possibilities make it an attractive choice for many homebuyers today. If you're seeking a practical yet stylish living space, a barndo could be the perfect fit for your lifestyle and needs.

Creative Ways to Customize Your Simple Barndo Living Space
----------------------------------------------------------

Transforming your simple barndo into a personalized haven is not only exciting but also a great way to express your creativity. Whether you are starting from scratch or looking to enhance your existing space, there are many creative ways to customize your barndo living area. Let’s explore some ideas that can help you make your space truly yours.

### Embrace Open Spaces

One of the key features of a simple barndo is its open layout. To maximize this space, consider the following:

- **Use Area Rugs:** Adding area rugs can help define different areas within your open space. Choose rugs that match your color scheme and evoke the mood you want.
- **Design Zones:** Create designated areas for relaxation, dining, and work. This can be achieved by arranging furniture in a way that directs flow and purpose.

### Incorporate Natural Elements

Nature can play a huge role in customizing your simple barndo. Here’s how:

- **Wood Accents:** Incorporate wooden features, such as beams or reclaimed wood walls, to add warmth. They bring a rustic charm that compliments the barndo style.
- **Indoor Plants:** Introducing greenery can liven up your space. Choose easy-to-care-for plants that fit your decor style.

### Play with Color

Your simple barndo allows for bold design choices, especially concerning color. Here are some tips:

- **Accent Walls:** Paint one wall a vibrant color or use wallpaper to draw attention. This can serve as a fantastic backdrop for furniture or artwork.

--------------------------------------------------------

Water is the essence of life, crucial for our well-being and overall health. But have you ever paused to think about how much water you should actually consume each day? Understanding the science behind daily water intake can help you make better decisions about hydration, ensuring your body remains healthy and functions optimally.

Your body relies on water for almost every physiological process. From regulating temperature to aiding digestion and transporting nutrients, hydration plays a critical role. But the right amount of water varies from person to person. So, how can you determine your ideal daily intake?

### Factors That Influence Water Needs

Several elements can impact how much water you need daily. Here are a few critical factors:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise regularly or engage in physical labor, you require more water to replace fluids lost through sweat.
- **Climate:** Hot and humid weather can lead to increased sweating, requiring extra hydration. In colder climates, the body may also require more water to maintain warmth.
- **Health Status:** Fever, vomiting, and diarrhea can all increase your body’s need for fluids. Additionally, certain medical conditions and medications can affect hydration needs.
- **Age:** Children and older adults may have different hydration needs. While children often need more water due to their high energy levels, older adults may need reminders to drink enough.
- **Diet:** Foods high in water content, like fruits and vegetables, contribute to daily hydration. Conversely, consuming a lot of salt or sugar can increase your need for fluids.

### Scientific Recommendations for Daily Water Intake

The general advice is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, typically referred to as the ""8x8 rule."" However, research suggests that individual needs vary and can be more nuanced. Guidelines from health organizations recommend a fluid intake of about:

- **Men:** Approximately 3.7 liters (or about 13 cups) of total beverages per day.
- **Women:** Around 2.7 liters (or about 9 cups) of total beverages per day.

This includes all fluids consumed, not just plain water. While this is a useful starting point, listening to your body's signals is equally vital.

### Understanding Thirst and Hydration

Your body has a natural mechanism to signal when you need water: thirst. However, relying solely on thirst might not be enough, especially for those who ignore this signal. Some individuals might not feel thirsty until they are already dehydrated, leading to issues like headaches, fatigue, and concentration loss. Therefore, it’s crucial to proactively hydrate throughout the day.

Monitoring the color of your urine can also be an effective hydration indicator. Pale yellow urine typically signifies proper hydration, while dark yellow or amber tones may indicate dehydration. Remember, everyone's body is different, so pay attention to your personal cues.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

To help you maintain proper hydration throughout the day, consider the following strategies:

- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keep a reusable water bottle with you. This makes it easy to sip throughout the day.
- **Set Reminders:** Use alarms or apps to remind you to drink water regularly.
- **Infuse Your Water:** Add fruits, herbs, or vegetables to your water for flavor. This can make hydration more enjoyable.
- **Eat Hydrating Foods:** Incorporate fruits and vegetables like watermelon, cucumbers, and oranges into your diet.
- **Drink Before Meals:** Have a glass of water before meals to stay hydrated and aid digestion.

Exploring the science behind daily water intake reveals the complexity of hydration requirements. Factors like activity level, age, and climate all influence how much water you need. Instead of rigidly adhering to a one-size-fits-all recommendation, focus on your body's unique needs, stay alert to signs of dehydration, and adopt practical hydration strategies. By doing so, you can enjoy a healthier, more energized life.

Understanding Hydration: What Impacts Your Water Needs?
-------------------------------------------------------

Your body is a complex system, and hydration plays a critical role in how well it functions. But how do you know how much water you actually need? Your water requirements can be influenced by a variety of factors, including activity level, climate, and overall health. By understanding these factors, you can make better choices to keep yourself adequately hydrated.

### Factors Affecting Water Needs

Several elements influence how much water you should drink each day. Here is a closer look at some of these factors:

- **Activity Level:** If you are active or exercise regularly, your body loses more water through sweat. Therefore, you may need to increase your water intake to compensate for the fluid loss.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather can lead you to sweat more, requiring a higher intake of water. In colder weather, you might not feel as thirsty, but your body still needs hydration.
- **Body Size:** Larger individuals typically need more water than smaller ones. A general rule of thumb is to drink enough to maintain a good level of hydration, which can be gauged by urine color.
- **Diet:** The foods you eat can impact your hydration needs. Foods with high water content like fruits and vegetables can contribute to your daily intake. Conversely, a diet high in salt or sugar can increase your thirst.
- **Health Condition:** Certain conditions may require you to drink more water, such as fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, your hydration needs also increase.

### Understanding the Recommended Amount

Experts often recommend a guideline of drinking at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, commonly referred to as the ""8x8 rule."" However, this is a general guideline and might not apply universally. The amount of water each individual needs can vary significantly based on the factors mentioned above.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
For most adults, adequate hydration is outlined as:

- Men: Approximately 3.7 liters (or about 13 cups) of total fluids each day.
- Women: Approximately 2.7 liters (or about 9 cups) of total fluids each day.

Keep in mind that these recommendations include all beverages and food sources of water. hydration from a variety of sources is essential.

### Listening to Your Body

One of the simplest ways to gauge your hydration needs is to pay attention to your body’s signals. Thirst is an innate mechanism your body uses to indicate that it requires fluid intake. Following your thirst is a good guideline, but there are other signs to consider as well:

- **Urine Color:** Clear or light-colored urine usually indicates good hydration, while dark yellow urine can mean you need to drink more water.
- **Dry Mouth:** A dry mouth is a clear indication of dehydration. It’s your body’s way of signaling that you need more fluids.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired? Sometimes, dehydration can lead to fatigue, as proper hydration is vital for energy levels.

### Creative Ways to Stay Hydrated

If you find it challenging to drink enough water throughout the day, you can explore some enjoyable ways to increase your overall water intake:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Infused Water:** Add slices of fruits like lemon, cucumber, or berries to your water for flavor.
- **Herbal Teas:** Unsweetened herbal teas can provide additional hydration and come in various flavors.
- **Soups and Stews:** Enjoying meals that contain broth can also contribute to your fluid intake.
- **Water-rich Foods:** Incorporate fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as watermelon, cucumber, and oranges.

Ultimately, staying hydrated is essential for maintaining energy levels, cognitive function, and overall health.

By understanding the factors that impact your water needs and paying attention to your body’s signals, you can ensure you remain adequately hydrated. Remember, every body is unique, and finding your personalized hydration sweet spot can lead to a happier, healthier life.

Common Myths About Water Intake: What’s True and What’s Not?
------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding how much water you should drink each day is vital for your health. There are many common myths about water intake that can lead to confusion. Let's delve into some of these myths to clarify what's true and what’s not.

 Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 1: Everyone Needs to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

This is a popular mantra that many people believe. While it's true that staying hydrated is crucial, the idea that everyone needs to consume exactly eight 8-ounce glasses, or 2 liters, every day is misleading. Hydration needs can vary significantly based on several factors:

- **Body weight:** Larger individuals typically need more water.
- **Activity level:** More active people lose fluids through sweat and require extra hydration.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather can increase your need for fluids.
- **Health conditions:** Certain illnesses or medications may demand higher or lower fluid intake.

### Myth 2: You Can Hydrate Just with Water

Another common myth is that you can only hydrate with plain water. While water is an excellent choice, you can maintain hydration through various beverages and food. Here are some alternatives:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Fruits and vegetables:** Staying hydrated with foods like cucumbers, oranges, and watermelon is effective.
- **Tea and coffee:** Surprisingly, non-alcoholic beverages like tea and coffee also contribute to your daily water intake.
- **Soups and broths:** These liquid foods are great for hydration as well.

### Myth 3: If You’re Thirsty, You Are Already Dehydrated

Many individuals view thirst as a sign of dehydration. While thirst can indicate that your body needs fluids, it isn’t always the first signal of impending dehydration. You may be thirsty due to:

- Physical activity
- Hot weather
- High salt consumption

This suggests that you should not wait until you feel thirsty to drink water. Instead, hydrate regularly throughout the day.

 Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 4: Clear Urine Means You Are Always Hydrated

Although clear urine is often viewed as a sign of adequate hydration, this isn’t a foolproof gauge. The color of your urine can be influenced by various factors, such as:

- **Diet:** Foods like beets and berries may change urine color.
- **Medications:** Some drugs can alter urine pigmentation.
- **Health conditions:** Certain infections or diseases can affect urine color.

While light-colored urine can indicate hydration, it’s essential to consider the context. If you are feeling thirsty or fatigued despite clear urine, it may be time to drink more.

### Myth 5: Drinking More Water Can Help You Lose Weight

Many claim that drinking excess water will lead to weight loss. While staying hydrated does play a role in overall health and can sometimes help with feelings of fullness, simply drinking more water will not magically melt away pounds. Sustainable weight loss involves a balanced diet and physical activity. Water can be a helpful tool, but it should be integrated into a well-rounded lifestyle.

### Myth 6: High Water Intake Can Cure All Ailments

Some people believe that drinking more water can solve various health problems, from headaches to fatigue. While hydration is important for overall well-being, it’s not a cure-all. Many health issues require appropriate medical attention, so don’t rely solely on increasing your water intake. It’s important to listen to your body and consult professionals when necessary.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/

1hn7ttc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1hn7ttc/my_experience_and_tips_after_a_1_week_trip_in/,My experience and tips after a 1 week trip in Costa Rica,"My girlfriend and I spent roughly 7 days in Costa Rica (La Fortuna and Quepos/Manuel Antonio primarily). Our trip was in Early December and was probably the most amazing trip we have ever been on. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

I found so many helpful tips and info on Reddit before my trip to Costa Rica, I felt I had to share my experience here in hopes someone may benefit. This is my first Reddit post so bare with me.

PRE TRIP

Our phone service providers (Verizon and T Mobile) offer international data/text/call packages you can buy. We just bought those packages and had no issues with cell service. We still downloaded the areas we needed on google maps offline, so that we could use it in case our service cut out. We had no issues.

It was hard to determine what to pack, it rains off and on each day, but it’s also very humid and warm (near the equator). You want something that will keep you dry, but not something that will keep you hot. We ended up just bringing lightweight water resistant coats (which still totally soaked thru one day when it was pouring raining), pants for the hiking trails (to prevent bug bites, which we never seen bugs, likely due to all the rain), and then gym shorts and tank tops/t shirts (which I was the most comfortable in, even during the light rains). Make sure to bring your swim trunks/bathing suits! For shoes just hiking boots, tennis shoes, and flip flops.

The weather while we were there was unpredictable. The weather app each night would say that it is going to rain all day/all week. But then in reality it would rain a little in the morning, and a little at night, and was beautiful thru the day, or it was a pleasant/very light sprinkle thru the day. There was 1 day we got poured on, but we still had fun with it. When we asked some locals, they told us the weather is totally unpredictable. Good luck.

RENTAL CAR / DRIVING

We arrived at the SJO airport early at 6 AM,  the airport was small and easy to navigate. We decided to rent a car, because it was not very expensive (compared to paying for private drivers each time you need one), and it allowed us WAY more freedom to be able to go out and about and do activities whenever/wherever we wanted. We rented a car from a company called “Vamos”, which was excellent. They picked us up from the airport and shuttled us across the street to their rental car office. They charge a $2000 deposit that gets refunded when you return the car. 

We rented a small car that did have 4x4, however we never needed to use the 4x4. I sure felt reassured having it just in case though! It was a little car and struggled on some of the steep inclines, but nothing we couldn’t manage. 

There was about a 3 or 4 hour drive from San Jose to La Fortuna area. Then was about a 5 or 6 hour drive from La Fortuna to Manuel Antonio. Then about another 5 hours back to SJO airport from Manuel Antonio (through the middle of the night) So, I had my fair share of time behind the wheel. Here are the main takeaways.

- All of the traffic signs are in Spanish (obviously), but I consider myself to be a good driver and I was able to adapt just fine. 

- I was warned about police pulling you over if you speed at all. Initially we did the speed limit/kept with the pace of traffic around us, which felt very slow. However there were a bunch of times where other people were speeding and/or passing right by us. Also there were many times where we would get stuck behind a motorcycle or a big truck that was going waaay too slow. We just got around them whenever it was safe. As I got more comfortable I kind of made my own speed limit based on what seemed normal from the other drivers I seen on the road. We never seen any police cars or had any issues.

- The roads are narrow and very curvy in some parts. Nothing completely outrageous, but not as big as what I was used to in the US. My girlfriend gets car sick but with some Dramamine she was fine. The roads were all paved just fine, occasionally there were roads that were in less than ideal shape, or full on dirt roads. Usually these were short lengths or totally avoidable. We stuck to paved roads 95% of the time.

- The potholes pop up on you quickly and out of nowhere. And also it rains often, so it will look like a small puddle, but actually will be a big pothole. Avoid these. Also definitely be cautious when it rains because some lanes on the road can become mostly or completely flooded, which you will have to briefly cross over into the opposing traffic lane to get around. We did see evidence of previous landslides that had been cleaned up off the road. At one point we there was a traffic stop because of construction crew cleaning up a landslide on the freeway which (fortunately) held us up only about 15 min until they let our lane move on. 

- On the freeway you will see traffic signs that say “Ceda” which means yeild. This is a sign to merge lanes. It is a very abrupt merge, so be ready. Also there will be times where you have to cross over bridges that are only wide enough for 1 car. You have to wait your turn and allow the opposing traffic to pass, then you go. Kind of a “whoever got here first” type of situation. Use caution.

-  We used google maps the whole time and never had any issues with it. We downloaded the google maps offline to our phone so that we could use it without service or WiFi  if we needed to. There was only one time where google maps tried to take us up onto a weird rocky treacherous dirt road, which just looking at it there was no way we were going to last on. I just took a different route and there was no time difference in our ETA. 

- We ran over a nail and got a flat tire one of the days in La fortuna. We discovered the flat in the morning when we were ready to head out for the day. We changed the tire to the spare that was in the trunk, and were told to go down to the gas station and they will fix the tire. The first gas station we stopped at said they couldn’t help us, but sent us to another gas station where they did fix the tire. Costed about $5 USD. Less people really spoke English as we got to the outskirts of town, but still everyone was very helpful.

- Driving at night was not as scary as I had read online. There were definitely stretches of road that was very dark, but you throw your brights on and just be careful. Also there always seemed to be other cars on the road around us, even on our drive from midnight to 5 am from Manuel Antonio to SJO. 

- There were a handful of toll roads along the way on our travels. It had to be like 2 or 3 bucks USD to get thru. We used cash at some and card at others. 

ITINERARY 

The La Fortuna was our first stop. The area is not very big, but there is so so so much to see and do, which is amazing, because you can pack so much into each day without worrying too much about travel times.

Day 1 - breakfast and coffee at Red Frog coffee roasters, explore the little town area, settle into and get set up in Airbnb, and Baldi Hot springs, which was just the first hot springs we found (was awesome, until we found The Springs). Got some bomb quesobirria tacos at “Mexicah Taqueria”. Just relaxed today because we were tired from the flight and the drive. 

Day 2 - coffee at a random coffee shop (there’s so many), Zip lining and ATV tours at “Go Adventure Arenal Park” (this was the day where we got totally rained on, we kept a good attitude, to be honest it added to the experience), lunch at “Soda el Arenal” (these people that own this place are so nice!!!!!) then we got a 2 day pass at “The Springs” to enjoy the hot springs (this place was next level amazing, better than Baldi IMO), massage at Arenal Natural Spa, which is the best massage we ever had.

Day 3 - Mistico hanging bridges, which is kind of like a big nature reserve with paved walkways and like 10 bridges, was pretty cool. It was raining on us pretty hard while we were here as well, but we got some plastic ponchos and were fine. We decided not to do any more hikes because of the rain, and felt like the Mistico bridges park gave us what we wanted for hiking. We stopped for food on the way there and on the way back at random Sodas. Then we chilled at The Springs for the rest of the day, which was amazing being in the hot springs with the light rain. 

Day 4 - breakfast and coffee, Travel to Manuel Antonio (but we stayed in Quepos, which is a 10/15 min drive to Manuel Antonio). Stopped in Jaco for food at “El Chicano Mexican Food” and walked on the beach for just a little bit to stretch the legs. Finished the rest of the drive and settled into our Airbnb in Quepos. Explored the Quepos town area, then got back to our place for some sleep.

Day 5 - Manuel Antonio National park. You have to make a reservation in advance online. You are not allowed to bring food/water into the park (unless in a non disposable water bottle). We got there early and were there for probably 8 hours. It was incredible. Think of awesome jungle hikes and a beautiful beach together in the same place. On the way in there will be multiple spots where people try to get you to park, just drive right by them. We parked in a lot nearby “Restaurante Donde Alex” (which we ate here after the park), and paid $20 cash for parking for the day if I remember correctly. It is as close as you can get to the park entrance. On the walk from the parking lot to the park entrance, there will be a bunch of people that try ask you if you need a guide inside the park, which may be helpful if you are into that type of thing and especially if you want to see wildlife. We decided not to get a guide. We were able to make our way all around the park no problem, and we seen all types of wildlife, monkeys, sloths, iguanas, birds, etc. we hiked around the park and hung out by the beach and it was awesome. Make sure you keep an eye on your bag if you leave it by the beach, the monkeys stole one or two other peoples bags.

Day 6 - We were so beat up tired from our trip that we just relaxed all day. Got massages, ate food (a good spot was “Coffee Stop”), did some gift shopping to bring stuff home for friends, hit the farmers market that was nearby (where we got the best hot sauce ever), and just took in the culture.

We left Quepos at Midnight to make it in time to return our rental car and get back to the airport for our 6 am flight back to LAX (I didn’t think this part though with the timing of everything, but we made it happen!). We got there a bit early, and had to wait for Vamos to open (which we called ahead and for a small fee they met us there early at 5 am and shuttled us to the airport). We got there early, and hung out at the Denny’s next door until the Vamos people got there. We returned the car and they took us to the airport no problems at all.


ADDITIONAL TIPS

- My girlfriend and I are big Foodies. The best part of the trip, was not the food. You can find good food definitely! But most places the food was just OK. I would not consider these areas to be “Foodie Destinations” by any means. “Sodas” are local casual dining spots. Eat at the sodas. The food is cheap, the people are nice, and you get a real genuine vibe of Costa Rica people. “Soda el Arenal” in La Fortuna was our favorite spot, the best food, and the nicest people running the place. I tried to mention the spots that we got good food above.

- The Coffee, Chocolate, and hot sauces were amazing!!!! We brought a bunch home and we wish we had brought home more.

- We are not the types to do certain kinds of tours, as we can feel constrained and slowed down sometimes. We like to run around and do our own thing. We got to see a bunch of wildlife throughout our trip. We never went out specifically on any kind of tour or event to go see wildlife. It just happened naturally while we were doing other things. And it was raining, which usually keeps the animals from being out and about. I’m not sure if we just got lucky, or if that’s common. However I will admit, at Manuel Antonio national park, the guides there are next level. They are able to see things you would never see. If this is super important to you to see animals, get a guide at Manuel Antonio. As I stated above, there are people outside the park that offer to be your guide, there are also people INSIDE the park who actually work at the park, that  are available to be your guide.

- We did not get to do Tabacon hot springs in La Fortuna. We did not know that we needed reservations, and they were booked like a month or 2 out when I looked. Everyone talks about it being so legendary, which I’m sure it is. However, “The Springs” was incredible, I can’t imagine how much better it can be. And they offer a 2 day pass that wasn’t very expensive, so it worked great for us to be able to pop in and out of the hot springs between our activities whenever we wanted.

- Obviously, you always have to be aware of your surroundings and watching out for anyone trying to jack you when you are traveling. We didn’t leave anything in the car unattended, and we didn’t bring anything around with us that we didn’t need to have. With that being said, I felt safer walking around Costa Rica in the middle of the night than I do walking around some parts of Los Angeles in the middle of the day. The locals in Costa Rica are all so nice. Everyone is very helpful. Even if they didn’t speak any English, they would still try to help point you in the right direction.

- We did not convert and cash (USD) to Colones (Costa rican currency). We used card most of the time, and cash some of the time. When I got home I realized that each time I swiped my card, there was a small “international transaction fee”. Not crazy, but worth mentioning. Also, I believe that at some spots, you are charged more if using CC or USD vs using Colones. We didn’t have any issues, but worth mentioning.

- In all the main touristy areas, most people spoke English either very well, or OK enough. As you get away from the touristy areas, don’t be surprised if people look at you with a blank stare if you are not speaking Spanish! Even still, everyone was very helpful. We used google translate to get us by where we needed to.



10 out of 10 would recommend anyone go to Costa Rica. We only seen a fraction of the country, but we were blown away. The vibe, the people, the environment, the activities… truly something special. 

I hope that this was helpful for anyone out there planning a trip. I am happy to answer any questions you may have or elaborate on anything as well. 

Cheers, and safe travels!",8,1735277084.0,CostaRicaTravel,2,1.0,False

My partner (m/22) and I (f/30) are together for 7 months now. I have this problem that I sometimes start crying when he tells me about something and I realise I didn't know that (e.g. something about philosophy). Childhood trauma lets me think that I have to be smart and know everything to be loved (working on  that already...).

This thing is usually only triggered within relationships and in this one, it is very extreme (also because he loves to talk about nerdy things for a long time and, when I try to say something about a topic I am knowledgeable in, such as renewable energies, he does not really listen). 

Anyways, we attended a conference on energy transition (my PhD topic) and I asked three questions to the panel. In the coffee-break he approached me and said: ""Three questions; you are trying to appear smart? Perhaps, you are smart even?"" This hurt so much, like a knife hit my chest. I had to go to the restroom and cry for a bit. After the second panel, I asked another question to the panel and he texted me ""You are holding a lecture..."". This hurt so much but this time, also made me mad, because, typically, it is him who is taking the space to talk about smart things and doesn't care, if the ""audience"" enjoys...

After that incident, we had a serious conversation. Many others signs made me think he was a narcissist. When I told him that, he admitted, that it might be true and that he had the same issues with his first relationship. He admitted he wanted to hurt me during the conference because he was annoyed by the fact that he knows that I actually do not read books (according to him), that I feel stupid and that, based on my questions, everybody is ""deceived"" thinking I am (and feel) smart.

During the conversation, he dropped many other things that really disturbed me such as, that sex was the center of the relationship to him (he was surprised I did not notice that), that he sometimes felt bored because sometimes I was apathic, that he likes people who are passionate and I do not seem to have interest nor passion (because I do not like to watch movies with him all the time; because I am not acting super interested in what he has to say saying ""whoa, I did not know that, tell me more!"" but, on the contrary, sometimes start to cry; etc.). 

Some other red flags are that I noticed him checking my phone (when I asked him what he was doing he said, he wanted to see, whether I was writing with other men); he pushed me into sex (by repeatedly asking, until I gave in - even though I warned him that it will kill by mood in the future; that his acting is egocentric and I do not like that, etc). He even said he doesn't see a future with me if I do not read... 

Anyways... I almost broke up after this because my trust in him and the faith in a future was gone. But then he texted that he thought that I was the ""most intelligent and interesting person he met"" and wants another chance, wants to work on his issues, and so on. I think, I am only hesitant because a small part within me thinks that maybe he just has a very low self-esteem and has to prove something. What are your thoughts; has the ""red line"" been crossed or should I give him another chance?

TL:DR: I almost broke up with my partner after he repeatedly undermined my confidence and belittled my contributions at a professional event, but now he wants another chance, leaving me torn.",3,1735277067.0,abusiverelationships,3,1.0,False
1hn7tbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1hn7tbh/am_i_being_unnecessarily_annoyed_by_a_rescue/,Am I being unnecessarily annoyed by a rescue organization taking credit for finding a dog that I actually found?,"So, yesterday my husband mentions to me that someone posted in a local Facebook group that a dog was missing and was last seen not too far from our house. So he says to me that we should go out and help look so I said ok. We go out at like 7-730pm drove around for a while stopped off for coffee, drove around a little more and didn’t find him so we head home. I pull into the drive and the missing dog is in my driveway (I know, how weird is that). Anyway, I have a long driveway, I stop when I see him, he runs over to the side bushes, I reverse my car, he comes out again, I stop, get out of my car and he runs to the side again. My husband calls the number on the post, the family says they’re coming. They come we can’t find the dog, it’s really dark and my neighborhood is very wooded and the houses are spread apart. So the dog rescue organization the family was in contact with comes and said ask if they could put a feeder with a camera on my property and we said yea of course. They never put up the feeder. The family and the rescue people are in my neighborhood until 2am looking for the dog.  My husband and I go to sleep hoping they find him. My husband contacts the owner today to ask and they still didn’t find him. The family and rescue people come back sporadically during the day to look for him. They even asked to go into my backyard to look and I said of course but they still could find him. Anyway, I have this funny feeling the dog is going to come back, the previous night I threw treats all around my driveway, this morning all the treats are gone. So I take a large box put a blanket in it with more treats and buy a $100 ring camera and set it up in the box. At around 7ish pm I went out, I come back an hour later and the dog is in my driveway again. My husband calls the owners and while I’m sitting in my car trying to keep an eye on the dog but it’s hard because it’s really dark out. I pull up the camera in the box and the dog  comes by a couple times but I lose sight of him. The owner comes with the dogs sibling. She looks around, the dog doesn’t come out. A good 20 minutes later me my husband the owner and the sibling are standing in the street and the dog comes out of the bushes. Family is reunited, everyone’s happy. The owner offers us the reward, we decline, just happy the dog is safe. Anyway, the rescue organization makes a post on Facebook not specifically saying they found the dog but the post makes it seem like they were responsible for finding the dog. Which is misleading, but wouldn’t bother me except in the same post they’re asking for donations. Ultimately the most important thing is the dog is safe because it’s really cold outside but I am a little salty that the organization is kind of taking credit for finding the dog and asking for donations. And I’m pissed off that they didn’t put up a feeder with a camera like they said they would, and I had to do it. They probably would have found him faster because they knew the dog was staying in the area of my house. Anyway, like would you be annoyed too?",4,1735277029.0,Pets,8,1.0,False

I'm currently making my way through Tusalaanga's courses in Inuktitut, South Qikiqtaaluk Dialect. I'm on the third unit currently. 

I love the grammar focus! I'm a huge grammar and language nerd so I feel right at home. 

However, I have one question. I've seen two distinct forms of the present tense -  t-ending and j-ending.

ex. Nirijunga (I eat) vs Kaapituqtunga (I drink coffee) 

I assume this difference must be based on the ending of the root - But I don't think Tusalaanga explains when to use which one and I don't know enough verbs yet to draw definitive conclusions myself. 

Is there a rule to know when to use which one? Right now, my theory is that it is an ending-in-a-vowel vs an ending-in-a-consonant thing. Is that correct?

I've been drinking Yerba Mate for 8+ years now, though I am in the States and our research on the effects of Yerba Mate on Pregnancy and Breastfeeding is very limited, as most people in the States consume coffee and not yerba. So when I became pregnant, I was a bit cautious about continuing to drink Yerba daily. After careful consideration, I decided to continue drinking it, and I found it helped with my nausea surprisingly.

Now, I am 3 months postpartum and I'm still drinking Yerba mate a few times a week, but I'm worried about continuing to drink it daily as I used to. Are there any negative effects? I only fill my mate up once a day and cycle through that yerba until it loses flavor. I haven't noticed that it interferes with my son's sleep or daytime activities even when he breastfeeds after I've had a bit of yerba mate. 

I am curious to know if women in Argentina and in South America continue to drink Yerba Mate throughout their pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Is it generally safe? ",0,1735276726.0,yerbamate,2,0.5,False

Possessing the cape was a figure so dark not even the glow from the stores unveiled the face. But he could tell it was a man from the offset, and the way he was slouched in the motorbike.

That vision stayed with Block for three days, and when he heard it on the news, the events were not connected; mysterious death of a baker and appearance of a similarly mysterious stranger in his little corner of the world. Even if you strung together the clues for him to follow, he would not see it. After all, much happened in Grrenfeld. The name might have been a bit gruff, but that was how the founders, all those ages ago, made it. And that's how it would stay, despite dispute from The Witches Council. Well, they were The Ladies Association of Feld, but the way they acted, up in everyone's business, and meetings at odd hours and places. Don't get him started on their odd shops with jewels and crystals, and...I digress.

The point was that Grrenfeld was Grrenfeld, nothing more nothing less. There was a peace in the air, a harmony that was yet lined with a tension so veiled you may yet miss it. Just like he almost missed the stranger this evening coming out of Mrs. Harrow's shop. Quickly, Block left the coffee he'd been nursing at Anna's Emporium of Thought at the table to follow this riveting stranger.""Should have gotten the paper cups,"" he lamented.

A quick detour around the block to collect his bike, an elegantly fashioned beauty, while keeping the magnetic yet undefined man in sight later, Block was revving slowly, and THEN, nothing. ""I swear he turned down this stree-,"" Block's speech was cut off when he registered a sudden presence behind him, an alarming feeling of danger pervading his senses. The overload was so great he forgot to fear. Or maybe he knew he had nothing to fear from the man behind him.

""Why do you follow me, Block?"" The mysterious presence asked.

""I don't know, curiosity, I guess?""

""What if I was a murderer? Didn't you see about that baker?"" The voice was certainly drawing.

""You're a magnetic presence. I didn't know the guy that well anyway. Never came into my shop.""

""You don't like your life. Oh well, I guess this is it.""

""What is this?"" Block turned, inquiring. His confidence had spiked, especially since the pressure had eased, and just a sense of mystery remained.

""I have to tell you my life story now. For you to understand."" The face is revealed, and it is tired. He could be from anywhere, anywhen. But it was a face olden, with a story carved unto it. But not in the fashion of the stories in Hallow's Grove by teenagers and daring lovers. It was carved by experience,



And when he spoke, the experience shone through. The tales told were those of a moon seen meteors with each crater meaningful. Block burst into a laugh, ""Wait, what? You can't be serious!""

""What,"" perplexed, ""How can I not? This is my life, here. I think I'm very serious, here.""

Wiping tears, block replied, ""It's just that I can't believe you exclusively hunt werewolves, bro. Like, dude. You're so cool, you know? I feel like you should be a vampire hunter or something. You've even got a cool name and all. A bit corny, but still cool.""

Brimm sighed, ""How many vampire hunters have you heard about?""

""What? Like, so many. There's the dude that went viral in China, and..."" he cited many examples. More than I care to remember.

""That's the point.""

""Huh?""

""There is a large demand for our skills, werehunters. Every amateur hunter seeks to do away with 'vamps', and the occasional Mage. But werehunting? Different ballgame. We have to craft our skills, and I have to be in top form to even be considered for a contract.""

""Okay, then. If the market is large, don't you need to still be the best to get a job? Why are you here? I still think you could be a vampire hunter if you're so good.""

His eyes clouded over, for a brief moment, ""Vampires are in my past, boy. They made me see this market. And it's so easy it's child's play. I could indenture you, if you like. Seeing as you seem to alternate between childish joy and disbelief.""

""What! No way dude! Don't I need some special training and stuff?""

""Normally. But, I am the best in the game, and hunting gets a little boring when you go to so many jobs alone. Some excitement would do us both some good.""

""So what do I need? And where will we go? I haven't heard about werewolves in this town, at least.""

Brimm's lips upturned a fraction of an inch, ""You've got that silver body motorcycle, and your apartment and place of work both have cornerstone plaster made of crushed silver and bane. That's enough to cloud you temporarily.""

So that's why Arfield the now-dead werewolf baker always sent someone for orders and deliveries.

""But what about the fighting part?""

""That's easy. I could lend you my spare set of silver weapons. You will need a personal effect, though. Ownership is a key part of the protection part. My client has some wolfsbane we can borrow.""

""Who's the client anyway?""

Brimm smiled, a proper one, ""In due time, Block. We'll need them to finish the indenture process. You can find out then.""  
""Please. Just so I don't look a fool in front of them?""

Another proper smile, ""The Witches' Council.""",1,1735276576.0,62stories,1,0.99,False

I'm not expecting much, reddit does seem to disappoint and conversations have a way of petering off...

But I'm hopeful.

I know what I'm looking for--I'm looking for a connection, someone I can laugh with and cry with and hold close no matter the day or the month or year. Someone who will support me in my endeavors, just as I will do for them. A person that enjoys exploration in the bedroom and has sexual interests of their own. Someone I can be honest and open with, and who will hopefully feel the same about me. I want a companion, a friend, and a lover.

Let's get the details out of the way. At this point I think I'm a little emotionally damaged--fifteen years of rejection and being ignored will do that, but I am loving and I do care. I'm relatively successful, all things considered: Master's, work as an engineer, own a home, expect to retire at some point in my life (yay). I have two children, and I'm very separated from my ex and working through a divorce. I like cooking, I don't like baking for the most part. I love bread but hate what it does to me, I really have to keep it out of the house. I make a giant pot of chai probably once a week. I hate coffee--for all you coffee snobs out there, you're crazy.

I enjoy walks, I think I'd enjoy hiking, though I haven't 'officially' done that any time in recent memory, but I love nature. I recently joined a crossfit gym, and the community is great as it helps with the loneliness--the workouts are killer and I think they're working. I'd love to be more active in life in general, whether that be traveling or working out or sports. I love to dance but haven't done it in public for years, unless you consider me secretly dancing as I listen to music while I walk the trails. I'm generally up for anything at least once, just ask and I'll probably do it. 

Writing is a passion of mine, I like reading but don't do it nearly enough, and I enjoy most games, whether that's video, board, or otherwise. I'm a fan of the NFL, but I can't be bothered to watch other sports, and my favorite TV series is Boston Legal.

Let’s talk about a stereotype that’s been bugging me lately: the idea that ENFJs are “manipulators.” It’s not just inaccurate but also diminishes the real strengths ENFJs bring to the table. (They're like superpowers, every hero/villain has different abilities) So today, I’m diving deep into **why this stereotype is wrong** and how we can better understand ENFJs through the lens of the different cognitive types: Thinkers, Sensors, Feelers, and Intuitives. 

Grab a coffee (or tea 🍵), because we’re about to have a long, heartfelt, and intellectually brain picky discussion. (lol)

# Why Are ENFJs Misunderstood as Manipulators?

ENFJs are often described as:

* **Charismatic**: We connect with people naturally.
* **Empathetic**: We sense emotions, even the unspoken ones.
* **Visionary**: We dream big for people, systems, and the future.

But also:

* **Charisma** can be mistaken for *“fakeness.”*
* **Empathy** can be mistaken for *emotional exploitation.*
* **Visionary leadership** can be mistaken for being *pushy or controlling.*

Although, these misinterpretations aren’t about who ENFJs actually are—they’re about how these traits are perceived through different lenses. Let’s break it down one type at a time: (I really tried my best, please be kind ❤️)

# For the Thinkers (T): Logic Lovers and Debate Champions

Thinkers, really are all about clarity, reason, and evidence. So, if someone seems too focused on feelings, it might make them wonder: *What’s their angle?* So, here’s why ENFJs aren’t manipulators but rather collaborators who respect their logic:

1. **We don’t exploit emotions—we clarify them.** When an ENFJ says, “You seem upset,” it’s not a tactic—it’s an observation meant to help *you* understand yourself better. We’re not trying to bypass your reasoning; we’re giving you more data to work with. Think of it this way: Emotions are just another form of input. Ignoring them leads to incomplete conclusions. ENFJs aim to integrate feelings with facts, not override one with the other.
2. **We value autonomy.** ENFJs are all about empowering others to make their own choices. Manipulation is about control, but ENFJs thrive on shared growth. If we suggest something, it’s because we believe in its potential—not because we want to win an argument or sway you unfairly.
3. **We respect your need for clarity.** Manipulators thrive on ambiguity and hidden motives. ENFJs? We’ll lay out our intentions plainly: “Here’s why I think this approach will work.” We actually appreciate when thinkers challenge us—it sharpens our vision.

# For the Sensors (S): Realists and Practical Minds

Sensors, value straightforwardness and tangible results. When an ENFJ talks big-picture or seems overly enthusiastic, it might feel like they’re not being genuine. But here’s why our intentions are grounded in authenticity, not manipulation:

1. **We’re consistently authentic.** Fake people change their demeanor depending on who’s watching. ENFJs? We’re the same person whether we’re talking to our best friend or a stranger. If we’re enthusiastic, it’s because that’s who we *are*—not an act. Were simply nice?
2. **We listen to your practical wisdom.** While ENFJs love envisioning a brighter future, we respect your ability to see what’s realistic right now. We’ll ask for your input because it keeps us grounded. What might seem like “pushiness” is just optimism—we believe in balancing hope with pragmatism, and we need your help to do it.
3. **We communicate transparently.** Manipulators hide their true intentions, but ENFJs lead with openness. If we have an idea or suggestion, we’ll tell you exactly why: “I think this might help because…” Our goal is collaboration, not deceit.

# For the Feelers (F): Empathetic Souls and Harmony Seekers

Fellow feelers, I know ENFJs can sometimes feel *too much*—too eager to help, too attuned to what you’re feeling, or too involved in your personal growth. But here’s why we’re not manipulators—we’re allies:

1. **We honor your boundaries.** Healthy ENFJs understand that support doesn’t mean overstepping. If we ever seem overbearing, it’s not because we’re trying to control—it’s because we care deeply. But we’re quick learners: Tell us your boundaries, and we’ll respect them.
2. **We thrive on mutual trust.** Manipulation creates distance. ENFJs? We want closeness, built on honesty and shared vulnerability. We’ll open up about our struggles because we value relationships rooted in trust, not power.
3. **We see your potential and want to nurture it.** When an ENFJ says, “I believe in you,” it’s not a tactic—it’s the truth. Our ultimate goal is to help others grow into their best selves, and that’s something you can feel in your gut.

# For the Intuitives (N): Visionaries and Abstract Thinkers

Intuitives, we share your love for ideas, connections, and future possibilities. But if our enthusiasm feels “too much” at times, here’s why it’s not really manipulation:

1. **We’re collaborators, not competitors.** Manipulators hoard power, but ENFJs thrive on shared success. If we’re passionate about an idea, it’s because we want to see it flourish *together*. We’re not trying to control the vision—we’re trying to build it with you.
2. **We’re adaptable, not dogmatic.** ENFJs are open to change when a better idea comes along. Manipulators cling to control, but we’ll pivot if it means the team benefits. We genuinely value your creative input.
3. **We lead with purpose, not pretense.** When we rally people around a goal, it’s because we believe in its potential. Manipulators lead for selfish reasons, but ENFJs are driven by a deep desire to create positive change—for people, communities, and the world.

# Final insights: 

Labeling ENFJs as manipulators doesn’t just hurt us—it damages the potential for meaningful relationships and understanding between all types.

1. **It diminishes trust.** If people assume ill intent, they won’t engage with ENFJs authentically, which creates unnecessary distance and suspicion. (A big no no)
2. **It devalues emotional intelligence.** ENFJs bring a rare gift to the table: the ability to connect deeply and inspire growth. Calling that “manipulation” undermines the importance of emotional insight in relationships and leadership. 
3. **It creates unnecessary division.** Stereotypes oversimplify complex personalities, making it harder for people to appreciate and learn from each other. (I'm more than my mbti, everyone is!)

# What ENFJs Want You to Know

We’re not perfect—no type is! But here’s the truth about ENFJs:

* **We thrive on authenticity.** Manipulation goes against our core values.
* **We build trust through openness and empathy.** Not control.
* **We lead with hope and collaboration.** Not selfishness.

1hn7fos,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/1hn7fos/another_death_valley_itinerary_check_25_days/,Another Death Valley Itinerary Check: 2.5 Days,"Spending 2 full days in Death Valley with my gf in January.  While I have spent several hours researching activities, hikes, etc., I'd still like some thoughts on the following ideas:

**Day 0**

9am: Pick up rental at LAS

11am: Lunch in Pahrump; pick up some supplies (extra water, snacks)

1pm: Check into The Ranch hotel; check out visitor center

3-5:30pm: Mesquite Flat Dunes for the short hike, sunset, then stargazing.  3pm Dunes Ranger Talk is occurring.

5:30-6:30pm: Dinner at Toll Road Restaurant (this would be an early dinner for us, but the timing here is such so that we can get to the night sky event below)

7-7:45pm: Night Sky Ranger Talk at the Furnace Creek Visitor Center

  
**Day 1**

6-8am: Arrive at Zabriskie point; stay for sunrise

8:30-9:30am:  Golden Canyon Ranger-led Hike

10-11:30am: 1hr horseback riding tour (this one is a must, since the tickets are already purchased)

12-1pm: Lunch at the 1849 Restaurant

\~3:15-5:30pm: Dante's Viewpoint for the sunset, stargazing

\~7-8pm: Harmony Borax Works for stargazing (\~30min hike)

\~8:30pm: Dinner at the Last Kind Words Saloon

  
**Day 2**

7-8am: Devils Golf Course

8:30-9:30am: Artists Palette for a scenic drive

10-11:30am: Badwater Basin (there may be a ranger talk, but it is not yet confirmed)

12:15-1pm: Lunch at The Inn on Death Valley

Rest of afternoon: Catch up on activities/ideas mentioned above but didn't get to.  Or if no catching up is needed, we go for another hike, such as a longer version of the Golden Canyon, or perhaps a hike at the Mosaic Canyon?  Or detour further out to Panamint Springs, or perhaps the Ubehebe Crater? Need ideas!

  
**Day 3**

\~6-6:30am: Be checked-out from Ranch hotel (grab some coffee); drive to LAS airport for 11am flight (dropping car off by 9am)



Questions:

How does the overview look?  I don't want to rush things, so I tried to make some buffer.  However, I worry that we really don't have enough ""real"" hikes.  We are game for a good hike or two, it's just the timing that I'm more concerned with.

Also, will the Golden Canyon ranger tour take us to the Red Cathedral?  And if not, is it worth coming back and continuing on to that location?  And will the tour end at the visitor center, meaning we can get to the stables in time for the 10am ride?

Last, is the Mosaic Canyon ""real"" hike worth it for the Day 2 afternoon, or perhaps someplace else?  Or a different activity altogether?

Thank you in advance!

1hn7cyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1hn7cyx/it_turns_out_our_new_rescue_is_reactive_and_its/,"It turns out our new rescue is reactive. And it's making everything brutal. I feel awful and don't know what to do or if it'll get better (Advice, Vent, etc.). ","In early December my girlfriend and I rescued a 10 month old puppy. I found him in my city's control center website and followed the shelter that scooped him up. He's a medium size wire coat mix who was a stray. Not totally sure of the breed. In October, we lost our beloved dog of 8 years due to a sudden exacerbation of his pancreatitis. Life felt empty without a dog and we wanted to give that love again. And it was important to me to try and help a dog in need. 

In short - it's been a disaster. This wasn't unexpected. I have had dogs and know this isn't an easy time to train them. And I know every shelter dog has their issues. But he needs so. many. things. ASAP. When I spoke to the shelter, I told them we live in a small city apartment, but we are near many parks and many dogs. I expressed reactivity would probably be an issue because it would be hard to exercise him in that environment. Conversely, it'd be a great environment for many dogs.  The second I leave my apartment, there's dogs all over. They assured me he was not reactive and he did well on our test walk. I think they misunderstood me, in that they thought I was just referring to aggression. Which he's definitely not, thankfully. 

And again, I know that a dog's nature in the shelter isn't their true personality. I'm not blaming them for anything. But he's reactive. Our first few walks at home were awful. He lunges hard on his harness, cries, bites his leash, bites hard on my hand / arm when seeing dogs. I immediately contacted a trainer because he's an escape risk. We've had two sessions with the trainer since - mostly assessing and working on impulse control. He's sort of gotten better? He no longer bites his leash unless he's extremely frustrated.  But the trainer also basically said we can't walk him as is. We need to build some sort of recall. So we've worked on whiplash training (""with me"" command), the up-down game to ""center"" him, and 1-2-3 leash training method to get him used to loose leash walks. Indoors, he's a champion. So then we worked our way to the gangway outside our building (small city apartment) and he's doing better there too. But other dogs just still completely make him lose his mind. People and rats / squirrels get to him as well, but not as bad. He loses all control so the build up to getting him on the street has been excruciating. We take him out when nobody is around and just go up and down our block (one small street). He does fine uninterrupted and has shown improvement, but any dog pulls him way past his threshold and he regresses. As i train him on the street, everyone with dogs gives me a disgusted look. I feel defeated. We think he just honestly wants to say hi and gets really excited. The family ahead of us in line for him didn't adopt him because he had so much puppy energy. He's just not socialized with dogs in-depth and I don't think dogs have showed him how to play, making him extra mouthy. 

I'm not blaming him one bit either. He's a dog. He has no impulse control. He's learning. I mean, it at least sounds like improvement? But this all leads to him being improperly exercised. As of now, we use half of his meal portions and some high-value treats mixed in for his training. He gets about an hour a day of this outside. But he's not burning energy. He's mentally working. It's something, but it's not enough. So, he gets destructive. Being inside is a nightmare. He goes after our furniture and all of our blankets. We try to play with him and he, again, has no impulse control. So if we play fetch or tug, he play bites hard. If he gets zoomies, he's gone in his own world. It must hurt to be that overwhelmed. He's not in control. He also knows that going for the couch and blankets gets him attention. So that's gotten worse. 

We do have ways to stimulate him inside. We have his crate, a separate bed to relax in, Kongs, several lick mats and puzzles. It's all high quality and healthy. It doesn't fully burn him out, but it doesn't seem to really soothe him much. It does something, but it's temporary (5-10 minutes). And we also do crate training. He just clearly doesn't love the crate. Leading to an entirely different issue. I basically haven't left home since bringing him home. Again, apartment living - and he's not comfortable in there. We do everything the trainer told us - feed him in his crate, place him in there and give treats periodically, play something on the TV, desensitize him to sounds like doors unlocking. He's just not a fan. Our last dog had the same anxiety and I felt like a prisoner at home. I had workarounds i.e., daycares and sitters, but it was needed every single time we left. For long outings of course we'd put him in daycare, but I couldn't even run across the street to the grocery store without noise complaints. I couldn't go on a coffee date with my girlfriend next door for an hour. >3 hours my dog will always be in someone's care - but less than that, I'd like my dog to be able to handle. And with the way this dog is acting in his crate (very quickly  batting at the crate door and barking once he's done with his Kong), I fear it'll be even worse when he's alone, and therefore, impossible to leave home. But anxiety has made me really afraid to try honestly. We don't have the best of neighbors either - one has routinely been digging through the garbage outside lately to see who isn't properly recycling. I'd like to avoid enemies. 

It's just...hard. And it's also winter in Chicago. I was ready to really burn him out on walks when he came home. I work from home and can put a lot of time into training. Of late, we've begun trying to establish a routine for him. But the reactivity is hard and breaking my spirit. The crate anxiety was a nightmare for years with my last dog (who was my absolute best friend) and I want to live a normal life. And with these issues piling up, he's destructive. He's very food motivated, which is a blessing and a curse. If he knows we have no food, he tests us more by going to tear my couch until we get some to begin training. If we have food, he knows it and demand barks. A lot. We ignore him, but he also knows desired behaviors we want. For instance, if he lays in his relax mat, he knows he gets treats. So now he kind of fakes being relaxed for a treat and if we go too long between treating him on his relax mat, he bursts up and starts barking. And if we continue to ignore, he starts zooming around and really play biting hard. We kind of have to scurry away from him without exciting him. And this all goes without mentioning the impact on housetraining. As well as trying to get him to learn to be brushed for maintenance, brush his teeth, etc. 

This is all to say, he is a sweet dog with a big heart. He's very cuddly and nothing feels better than when he just comes over, plops next to me, and extends his arm at me like he's giving me a hug. But, are these issues salvageable? Am I even the right person for him. Sometimes I just get so angry and so upset and he just play bites and play bites and play bites and I explode. He sees the trainer weekly, he has high quality toys, I can put real time into training him. But there's a lot working against me. The other day we finalized adoption papers after being foster-to-adopt for his neutering (was neutered on Thanksgiving week) and I just wanted to feel joy and pride. This big day of finalizing this dog coming home. To be embraced with warm and love after being on the street. And he just destroyed and barked and pooped all on the floor. I felt regret, I didn't feel love, I felt disappointment and anger, completely at myself. I know he was going to be work and I know its early, I just wonder if it gets better or if I'm truly not a fit. I love him in our calmer moments, but they're not even once a day. He doesn't know how to rest himself, so when he's not under-stimulated, he's overtired and equally destructive. I just don't know. I don't want to give up. But we can't even clean the house up without all of the barking. We can't go outside anymore without him. And we can't take him beyond 10 feet of our building to test his walking. I'm following everything I'm told, I can spend money to  help him (not tons but weekly training for a month or so), I try to be patient. I'm just upset. I don't know what to do. And I feel like a horrible person for feeling regret. I just want to know if this will get better or if he's incompatible with me. I want a companion and a buddy for my work from home job and around our beautiful neighborhood. I just don't want to be in this constant fear and constantly mouthed at as he just doesn't listen or as he constantly demand barks. I don't know what I need.

Absolutely get this one if you want a fresh fragrance that is subtle but performs for 7-8 hours !! It's been my daily driver since November (note the liquid amount of the peeled out bottle - had to take them off cos the black ink got smudged)



**Chill by the Pacific** \- from the opening notes of mint to a straight up tropical fruit punch. Definitely satisfies the itch if the OG is out of your budget !! Longevity is insane - can smell on my clothes even the next day 



**Plumilicious** \- Straight up plums with an oriental mix of oud and booze and cinnamon in the background. A winter banger for sure ! Again, really good performance. 



**Akro Awake** \- I had bought a whole bottle after falling in love with it. Colour me surprised when this is basically the same, maybe a little more wearable than the OG. It's the smell of medium roast coffee that is freshly ground and you put it on for a French Press. 



**LV Afternoon Swim** \- having a decant of the OG, its a no brainer to go for Al Maham's, considering the subpar performance of the OG. Imagine being spritzed with the chilled and fizzy orange Fanta on a hot day.. or the smell of the juice that sprays while peeling a straight up cold orange..  get around 5-6 hours easily. And much better performance than the brand with good cover art !!!

The best part of all these is the performance. Was putting my shirt for laundry from yesterday and it still  had Chill by Pacific lingering strongly on it. After more than 24 hours!!

1hn7bnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1hn7bnt/i_adopted_a_dog_and_now_im_wondering_if_im_good/,I adopted a dog and now I'm wondering if I'm good enough or equipped for this. I feel awful and defeated. ,"In early December my girlfriend and I rescued a 10 month old puppy. I found him in my city's control center website and followed the shelter that scooped him up. He's a medium size wire coat mix who was a stray. Not totally sure of the breed. In October, we lost our beloved dog of 8 years due to a sudden exacerbation of his pancreatitis. Life felt empty without a dog and we wanted to give that love again. And it was important to me to try and help a dog in need. 

In short - it's been a disaster. This wasn't unexpected. I have had dogs and know this isn't an easy time to train them. And I know every shelter dog has their issues. But he needs so. many. things. ASAP. When I spoke to the shelter, I told them we live in a small city apartment, but we are near many parks and many dogs. I expressed reactivity would probably be an issue because it would be hard to exercise him in that environment. Conversely, it'd be a great environment for many dogs.  The second I leave my apartment, there's dogs all over. They assured me he was not reactive and he did well on our test walk. I think they misunderstood me, in that they thought I was just referring to aggression. Which he's definitely not, thankfully. 

And again, I know that a dog's nature in the shelter isn't their true personality. I'm not blaming them for anything. But he's reactive. Our first few walks at home were awful. He lunges hard on his harness, cries, bites his leash, bites hard on my hand / arm when seeing dogs. I immediately contacted a trainer because he's an escape risk. We've had two sessions with the trainer since - mostly assessing and working on impulse control. He's sort of gotten better? He no longer bites his leash unless he's extremely frustrated.  But the trainer also basically said we can't walk him as is. We need to build some sort of recall. So we've worked on whiplash training (""with me"" command), the up-down game to ""center"" him, and 1-2-3 leash training method to get him used to loose leash walks. Indoors, he's a champion. So then we worked our way to the gangway outside our building (small city apartment) and he's doing better there too. But other dogs just still completely make him lose his mind. People and rats / squirrels get to him as well, but not as bad. He loses all control so the build up to getting him on the street has been excruciating. We take him out when nobody is around and just go up and down our block (one small street). He does fine uninterrupted and has shown improvement, but any dog pulls him way past his threshold and he regresses. As i train him on the street, everyone with dogs gives me a disgusted look. I feel defeated. We think he just honestly wants to say hi and gets really excited. The family ahead of us in line for him didn't adopt him because he had so much puppy energy. He's just not socialized with dogs in-depth and I don't think dogs have showed him how to play, making him extra mouthy. 

I'm not blaming him one bit either. He's a dog. He has no impulse control. He's learning. I mean, it at least sounds like improvement? But this all leads to him being improperly exercised. As of now, we use half of his meal portions and some high-value treats mixed in for his training. He gets about an hour a day of this outside. But he's not burning energy. He's mentally working. It's something, but it's not enough. So, he gets destructive. Being inside is a nightmare. He goes after our furniture and all of our blankets. We try to play with him and he, again, has no impulse control. So if we play fetch or tug, he play bites hard. If he gets zoomies, he's gone in his own world. It must hurt to be that overwhelmed. He's not in control. He also knows that going for the couch and blankets gets him attention. So that's gotten worse. 

We do have ways to stimulate him inside. We have his crate, a separate bed to relax in, Kongs, several lick mats and puzzles. It's all high quality and healthy. It doesn't fully burn him out, but it doesn't seem to really soothe him much. It does something, but it's temporary (5-10 minutes). And we also do crate training. He just clearly doesn't love the crate. Leading to an entirely different issue. I basically haven't left home since bringing him home. Again, apartment living - and he's not comfortable in there. We do everything the trainer told us - feed him in his crate, place him in there and give treats periodically, play something on the TV, desensitize him to sounds like doors unlocking. He's just not a fan. Our last dog had the same anxiety and I felt like a prisoner at home. I had workarounds i.e., daycares and sitters, but it was needed every single time we left. For long outings of course we'd put him in daycare, but I couldn't even run across the street to the grocery store without noise complaints. I couldn't go on a coffee date with my girlfriend next door for an hour. >3 hours my dog will always be in someone's care - but less than that, I'd like my dog to be able to handle. And with the way this dog is acting in his crate (very quickly  batting at the crate door and barking once he's done with his Kong), I fear it'll be even worse when he's alone, and therefore, impossible to leave home. But anxiety has made me really afraid to try honestly. We don't have the best of neighbors either - one has routinely been digging through the garbage outside lately to see who isn't properly recycling. I'd like to avoid enemies. 

It's just...hard. And it's also winter in Chicago. I was ready to really burn him out on walks when he came home. I work from home and can put a lot of time into training. Of late, we've begun trying to establish a routine for him. But the reactivity is hard and breaking my spirit. The crate anxiety was a nightmare for years with my last dog (who was my absolute best friend) and I want to live a normal life. And with these issues piling up, he's destructive. He's very food motivated, which is a blessing and a curse. If he knows we have no food, he tests us more by going to tear my couch until we get some to begin training. If we have food, he knows it and demand barks. A lot. We ignore him, but he also knows desired behaviors we want. For instance, if he lays in his relax mat, he knows he gets treats. So now he kind of fakes being relaxed for a treat and if we go too long between treating him on his relax mat, he bursts up and starts barking. And if we continue to ignore, he starts zooming around and really play biting hard. We kind of have to scurry away from him without exciting him. And this all goes without mentioning the impact on housetraining. As well as trying to get him to learn to be brushed for maintenance, brush his teeth, etc. 

This is all to say, he is a sweet dog with a big heart. He's very cuddly and nothing feels better than when he just comes over, plops next to me, and extends his arm at me like he's giving me a hug. But, are these issues salvageable? Am I even the right person for him. Sometimes I just get so angry and so upset and he just play bites and play bites and play bites and I explode. He sees the trainer weekly, he has high quality toys, I can put real time into training him. But there's a lot working against me. The other day we finalized adoption papers after being foster-to-adopt for his neutering (was neutered on Thanksgiving week) and I just wanted to feel joy and pride. This big day of finalizing this dog coming home. To be embraced with warm and love after being on the street. And he just destroyed and barked and pooped all on the floor. I felt regret, I didn't feel love, I felt disappointment and anger, completely at myself. I know he was going to be work and I know its early, I just wonder if it gets better or if I'm truly not a fit. I love him in our calmer moments, but they're not even once a day. He doesn't know how to rest himself, so when he's not under-stimulated, he's overtired and equally destructive. I just don't know. I don't want to give up. But we can't even clean the house up without all of the barking. We can't go outside anymore without him. And we can't take him beyond 10 feet of our building to test his walking. I'm following everything I'm told, I can spend money to  help him (not tons but weekly training for a month or so), I try to be patient. I'm just upset. I don't know what to do. And I feel like a horrible person for feeling regret. I just want to know if this will get better or if he's incompatible with me. I want a companion and a buddy for my work from home job and around our beautiful neighborhood. I just don't want to be in this constant fear and constantly mouthed at as he just doesn't listen or as he constantly demand barks. I don't know what I need.

An Enjoyable Combination Right from the initial sip, I was pleasantly taken aback by the nuanced and rich flavor of Nagano Tonic. The berry sweetness is beautifully balanced with earthy hints, creating a delightful combination that is both invigorating and relaxing. The smoothness of the texture means there’s no unpleasant grit, a common issue with many tonics. Whether sipped solo or blended with water or juice, it’s an easy and enjoyable choice for everyday use.

Effectiveness:

[✅ OFFICIAL WEBSITE](https://bit.ly/NaganoTonic-2024)

Is it an Energizing Elixir or merely a Placebo Potion? Being someone who often struggles with midday fatigue, I was eager to try Nagano Tonic. For several weeks, I made it a part of my morning routine, replacing my typical cup of coffee. The initial effects were quite subtle, but gradually, I noticed a consistent increase in my energy throughout the day. Unlike caffeine, which can sometimes lead to jitters and crashes, the tonic offered a smooth uplift without any negative side effects. I felt more alert and focused, ready to approach my tasks with a fresh burst of energy.

Long-Term Benefits:

Promoting Wellness from Within Beyond its short-term effects, Nagano Tonic asserts that it can deliver lasting benefits with ongoing use. It seeks to enhance the body’s natural defenses against stress and fatigue, thereby encouraging overall health and energy. While I haven't observed significant improvements so far, I remain positive about its potential to boost my health over time. As with any natural supplement, patience and regularity are crucial, and I look forward to my continued journey with Nagano Tonic.

Backed by Scientific Research

Nagano Lean Body Tonic’s formulation is supported by extensive scientific research conducted in the USA. Studies have confirmed the effectiveness of its key ingredients. For instance, EGCG, found in green tea, has been shown to enhance fat oxidation and improve metabolic rate. Ashwagandha has been demonstrated to lower cortisol levels, which helps reduce stress-related weight gain and cravings. Additionally, Inulin has been proven to improve gut health and promote feelings of fullness, aiding in effective weight management. These studies underscore the tonic’s strong scientific foundation, ensuring users benefit from a product backed by evidence-based health advantages.

Price and Accessibility:

A Smart Choice for Your Health? When it comes to pricing, Nagano Tonic is considered mid-range among wellness products. While it is more expensive than typical energy drinks, the superior ingredients and potential health benefits make it a justifiable expense for those who prioritize quality and eco-friendliness. Additionally, its online presence allows a diverse audience to find this alternative to conventional energy boosters with ease.

I had been Six for as long as I could remember, curled up behind steel bars.

I used to find comfort in the walls surrounding me.

I didn’t have hair anymore, but when I did, it was thick and red, hanging in my eyes.

I had a routine, and I stuck to it.

I woke up every morning starving.

I allowed myself to be dragged for testing. The man asked me if it hurt when he ripped off my arms and legs, cutting me open.

I stared at the ceiling and wiggled my toes to communicate.

I was asked questions like, “What do you feel when I do this?”

Numb.

Especially when my muscles spasmed, and I couldn’t control my mouth.

When I was taken back to my cage, I ate my breakfast, stuffing it into my mouth, enjoying the squishy feeling of my food slipping between my fingers.

“Hey.”

I didn’t know Ten was awake.

Ten was different. I didn’t know how to speak. I tried, but my vocal cords were shredded and tangled, and all I could really do was grunt. But Ten could.

Despite him being more alert, his eyes wide, I could still see the ugly stitches gluing his head to his body. I remember his eyes used to be the color of coffee. 

Now, I was staring into a milky white nothing, a slow spreading splodge that had spiderwebbed into his pupils. 

But his hair was growing back, curly and dark, glued to his forehead.

Ten held up a key, lips curling into a smile.

“We’re getting the fuck out of here, Six.”

I dazedly watched him unlock his own cage before slowly making his way over, careful not to set off any alarms.

Ten unlocked my cage with a satisfying click, the door swinging open.

He helped me to my feet, smiling widely. ""You're okay, Six.""

Ten grabbed my arm, helping me stumble out. I could barely walk, but Ten was quick to lift me onto his shoulder, the two of us ascending the stairs.

We were inside a normal suburban house. 

I tried not to notice my old belongings dumped in a trash bag.

My clothes, my ID, my phone…

I glimpsed One’s letterman jacket.

Two’s sneakers.

Four’s destroyed iPhone and her shredded jeans.

The girl who I used to be, who used to be whole. 

I think she was friends with them. 

Ten pulled open the door, sunlight bathing my face. He was already running towards a guy on his phone.

“Can you help us?” Ten’s voice was hysterical. “Look, we’ve been held captive by the guy across the street, and—hey! Dude, where the fuck are you going? We need help!”

The guy with the phone was screaming.

Ten’s head jerked violently, nostrils flaring. 

He lunged, suddenly, taking a bite out of the man’s shoulder.

Then, I smelled it.

Food.

Just like the food I was given. The rich, coppery sludge I stuffed myself with.

There was a woman standing on the sidewalk, and already, I was… running, unable to control my spasming muscles, my snapping mouth, my hunger…

So hungry. I dived onto the woman, knocking her onto her back and biting down on her arm. She tasted so good…

So hungry.

I dug in deeper, my body twisting and contorting, my vision blurring, my mind whirring, thoughts growing stagnant. 

More screams. 

The woman I attacked jerked underneath me, her eyes flying open, white and lifeless. 

In the corner of my eye, Ten was running, sprinting towards a family. 

I could hear the sound of his teeth tearing into flesh, starving, so fucking starving. Kneeling over his meal, he dove inside the cavern in their chest, feasting on entrails slipping through his fingers. 

Gunshots. 

Someone was trying to stop me. 

But I kept going, diving from person to person, crawling on my hands and knees, slurping mutilated guts from my hands. 

""Six!"" 

Ten was screaming. 

""We need to get out of here,"" he grabbed me, choking on sobs. 

""We did a bad thing, Six. Fuck. We did a bad thing, and we need to get out here.""

Across the street, normal people were suddenly diving onto each other. 

Blood was spilling, seeping across warm concrete. 

But I was smiling. Because this was better than the shitty food I was given. 

This was... fresh. 

And I was...

I have a ZP6, a C40, and an Ode with V2 burrs at home and I brew mostly light roasts - and all 3 grinders all get used, so I’m aware of the difference flavor profiles that each grinder contributes to the brewed cup. I’m planning on buying another hand grinder to take to my in-laws’ home that’ll live there permanently - that way I don’t have to carry a grinder with me every time I visit. I’ve narrowed it down to the X-Ultra and the K-Ultra. Cost isn’t an issue so take that out of the equation. I should add that my in-laws live in Costa Rica, so practically all of the coffee I can buy there is medium roast at best. Doesn’t mean I can’t bring my preferred types of coffee with me when I visit, but given the coffee options I get when I’m there, I suspect I’ll be brewing more medium roasts. I want something that’s different from the grinders I have at home (rather than a duplicate of what I’ve got), and I want it to be able to handle whatever I throw at it.

From spelunking through Reddit and YouTube for reviews on both grinders, I can’t tell if I should be considering the X-Ultra since it seems like it might offer a little more clarity in some cups than the K-Ultra (for any light roasts that I bring with me)… or if I should just go with the K-Ultra and not look back. I do worry about the magnets in the X-Ultra’s catch cup being too weak but as far as I can tell, the build quality on both grinders is solid.

ASAP. When I spoke to the shelter, I told them we live in a small city apartment, but we are near many parks and many dogs. I expressed reactivity would probably be an issue because it would be hard to exercise him in that environment. Conversely, it'd be a great environment for many dogs.  The second I leave my apartment, there's dogs all over. They assured me he was not reactive and he did well on our test walk. I think they misunderstood me, in that they thought I was just referring to aggression. Which he's definitely not, thankfully. 

And again, I know that a dog's nature in the shelter isn't their true personality. I'm not blaming them for anything. But he's reactive. Our first few walks at home were awful. He lunges hard on his harness, cries, bites his leash, bites hard on my hand / arm when seeing dogs. I immediately contacted a trainer because he's an escape risk. We've had two sessions with the trainer since - mostly assessing and working on impulse control. He's sort of gotten better? He no longer bites his leash unless he's extremely frustrated.  But the trainer also basically said we can't walk him as is. We need to build some sort of recall. So we've worked on whiplash training (""with me"" command), the up-down game to ""center"" him, and 1-2-3 leash training method to get him used to loose leash walks. Indoors, he's a champion. So then we worked our way to the gangway outside our building (small city apartment) and he's doing better there too. But other dogs just still completely make him lose his mind. People and rats / squirrels get to him as well, but not as bad. He loses all control so the build up to getting him on the street has been excruciating. We take him out when nobody is around and just go up and down our block (one small street). He does fine uninterrupted and has shown improvement, but any dog pulls him way past his threshold and he regresses. As i train him on the street, everyone with dogs gives me a disgusted look. I feel defeated. We think he just honestly wants to say hi and gets really excited. The family ahead of us in line for him didn't adopt him because he had so much puppy energy. He's just not socialized with dogs in-depth and I don't think dogs have showed him how to play, making him extra mouthy. 

I'm not blaming him one bit either. He's a dog. He has no impulse control. He's learning. I mean, it at least sounds like improvement? But this all leads to him being improperly exercised. As of now, we use half of his meal portions and some high-value treats mixed in for his training. He gets about an hour a day of this outside. But he's not burning energy. He's mentally working. It's something, but it's not enough. So, he gets destructive. Being inside is a nightmare. He goes after our furniture and all of our blankets. We try to play with him and he, again, has no impulse control. So if we play fetch or tug, he play bites hard. If he gets zoomies, he's gone in his own world. It must hurt to be that overwhelmed. He's not in control. He also knows that going for the couch and blankets gets him attention. So that's gotten worse. 

We do have ways to stimulate him inside. We have his crate, a separate bed to relax in, Kongs, several lick mats and puzzles. It's all high quality and healthy. It doesn't fully burn him out, but it doesn't seem to really soothe him much. It does something, but it's temporary (5-10 minutes). And we also do crate training. He just clearly doesn't love the crate. Leading to an entirely different issue. I basically haven't left home since bringing him home. Again, apartment living - and he's not comfortable in there. We do everything the trainer told us - feed him in his crate, place him in there and give treats periodically, play something on the TV, desensitize him to sounds like doors unlocking. He's just not a fan. Our last dog had the same anxiety and I felt like a prisoner at home. I had workarounds i.e., daycares and sitters, but it was needed every single time we left. For long outings of course we'd put him in daycare, but I couldn't even run across the street to the grocery store without noise complaints. I couldn't go on a coffee date with my girlfriend next door for an hour. >3 hours my dog will always be in someone's care - but less than that, I'd like my dog to be able to handle. And with the way this dog is acting in his crate (very quickly  batting at the crate door and barking once he's done with his Kong), I fear it'll be even worse when he's alone, and therefore, impossible to leave home. But anxiety has made me really afraid to try honestly. We don't have the best of neighbors either - one has routinely been digging through the garbage outside lately to see who isn't properly recycling. I'd like to avoid enemies. 

It's just...hard. And it's also winter in Chicago. I was ready to really burn him out on walks when he came home. I work from home and can put a lot of time into training. Of late, we've begun trying to establish a routine for him. But the reactivity is hard and breaking my spirit. The crate anxiety was a nightmare for years with my last dog (who was my absolute best friend) and I want to live a normal life. And with these issues piling up, he's destructive. He's very food motivated, which is a blessing and a curse. If he knows we have no food, he tests us more by going to tear my couch until we get some to begin training. If we have food, he knows it and demand barks. A lot. We ignore him, but he also knows desired behaviors we want. For instance, if he lays in his relax mat, he knows he gets treats. So now he kind of fakes being relaxed for a treat and if we go too long between treating him on his relax mat, he bursts up and starts barking. And if we continue to ignore, he starts zooming around and really play biting hard. We kind of have to scurry away from him without exciting him. And this all goes without mentioning the impact on housetraining. As well as trying to get him to learn to be brushed for maintenance, brush his teeth, etc. 

This is all to say, he is a sweet dog with a big heart. He's very cuddly and nothing feels better than when he just comes over, plops next to me, and extends his arm at me like he's giving me a hug. But, are these issues salvageable? Am I even the right person for him. Sometimes I just get so angry and so upset and he just play bites and play bites and play bites and I explode. He sees the trainer weekly, he has high quality toys, I can put real time into training him. But there's a lot working against me. The other day we finalized adoption papers after being foster-to-adopt for his neutering (was neutered on Thanksgiving week) and I just wanted to feel joy and pride. This big day of finalizing this dog coming home. To be embraced with warm and love after being on the street. And he just destroyed and barked and pooped all on the floor. I felt regret, I didn't feel love, I felt disappointment and anger, completely at myself. I know he was going to be work and I know its early, I just wonder if it gets better or if I'm truly not a fit. I love him in our calmer moments, but they're not even once a day. He doesn't know how to rest himself, so when he's not under-stimulated, he's overtired and equally destructive. I just don't know. I don't want to give up. But we can't even clean the house up without all of the barking. We can't go outside anymore without him. And we can't take him beyond 10 feet of our building to test his walking. I'm following everything I'm told, I can spend money to  help him (not tons but weekly training for a month or so), I try to be patient. I'm just upset. I don't know what to do. And I feel like a horrible person for feeling regret. I just want to know if this will get better or if he's incompatible with me. I want a companion and a buddy for my work from home job and around our beautiful neighborhood. I just don't want to be in this constant fear and constantly mouthed at as he just doesn't listen or as he constantly demand barks. I don't know what I need. Words of encouragement, a realistic conversation, what. I'm just so sad.  ",4,1735274269.0,rescuedogs,1,1.0,False

But seriously, I can’t be the only one who’s had these thoughts, right?

","[Fresh and Trendy – Discover the Hottest New Products!](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=gsi outdoors infinity backpacker mug&s=date-desc-rank&tag=smartymode-20)

In the realm of outdoor gear, a reliable and versatile mug can significantly enhance your enjoyment of the wilderness.  The GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug is specifically designed to meet the needs of hikers, campers, and backpackers who value durability, lightweight design, and eco-friendly materials. This in-depth review will explore its features, benefits, and how it compares to other options on the market, helping you determine if it’s the ultimate outdoor drinking companion for you.

<h2>Design and Key Features: A Closer Look at the GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug</h2>

The GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug distinguishes itself through a thoughtful design that addresses common pain points experienced by outdoor enthusiasts.  Let's break down its key features:

<h3>The Secure and Convenient Strap Handle</h3>

The integrated strap handle is a game-changer.  Unlike many mugs that rely on flimsy handles or require awkward carrying methods, the Infinity Backpacker Mug’s handle is robust and designed for easy attachment to backpacks. This ensures your hot coffee or refreshing cold drink stays secure even on the most challenging trails.  The handle is also strategically positioned to allow for comfortable gripping, even with gloves on.

<h3>Insulating Sleeve:  Keeping Your Drinks at the Perfect Temperature</h3>

The cloth-wrapped foam insulating sleeve is more than just a stylish addition; it's a crucial element in maintaining your beverage’s temperature. This sleeve provides a comfortable grip, preventing accidental slips, and significantly enhances the mug’s insulation capabilities.  Whether you’re enjoying a steaming cup of tea on a chilly morning or a chilled drink on a hot afternoon, the sleeve helps keep your drink at its ideal temperature for longer.

<h3>Spill-Proof Design: Say Goodbye to Spills on the Trail</h3>

Accidents happen, especially during outdoor adventures.  The Infinity Backpacker Mug's spill-resistant top and sealable spout minimize the risk of spills and messes. This is a critical feature for backpackers, as spilled liquids can add extra weight and create unwanted cleanup during a hike.  The secure lid ensures your drink stays put, even if your pack takes a tumble.

<h2>Materials, Durability, and Eco-Consciousness</h2>

The Infinity Backpacker Mug is built to last.  Its construction uses durable, non-leaching clear polypropylene, a material known for its strength and resistance to breakage. This makes it ideal for withstanding the bumps and knocks of outdoor use.

<h3>Lightweight Design for Effortless Carrying</h3>

Weighing in at a mere 3.5 ounces (approximately 100 grams), the Infinity Backpacker Mug is impressively lightweight.  This is crucial for backpackers who prioritize minimizing weight to reduce fatigue and improve overall comfort on the trail.  The lightweight design doesn’t compromise on durability; it simply prioritizes efficiency.

<h3>Eco-Friendly Construction with Recycled Materials (RPET)</h3>

GSI Outdoors demonstrates a commitment to sustainability by incorporating RPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate) in the mug's construction.  This eco-friendly approach reduces reliance on virgin plastics, lessening the environmental impact of your outdoor adventures. This aligns with the growing preference among outdoor enthusiasts for sustainable gear.  Choosing this mug contributes to a smaller carbon footprint.

<h2>Ease of Use and Portability</h2>

The Infinity Backpacker Mug is designed for effortless use, even in challenging outdoor conditions.  The non-slip features on the insulating sleeve provide a secure grip, preventing accidental drops, even when your hands are wet or cold.  Its cylindrical shape allows for compact packing, easily fitting into most backpacks without taking up excessive space.

<h2>Maintenance and Cleaning: Keeping Your Mug in Top Condition</h2>

Maintaining your GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug is simple. Hand washing with mild detergent is recommended, and it’s crucial to dry all components thoroughly before storing to prevent the growth of mildew or bacteria.  Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, and definitely avoid microwaves and dishwashers, as these can damage the materials and shorten the mug's lifespan.

<h2>Real-World Experiences and User Reviews</h2>

Numerous user reviews highlight the Infinity Backpacker Mug's performance in various outdoor settings.  Many users praise its durability, lightweight design, and effective insulation.  While some users have mentioned the mug occasionally slipping out of its cloth holder, the overall feedback emphasizes its robustness and reliability.  These positive experiences underscore the mug’s suitability for long trips and frequent outings.

<h3>Case Study: Appalachian Trail Thru-Hike</h3>

One hiker used the Infinity Backpacker Mug during their Appalachian Trail thru-hike, subjecting it to daily use under challenging conditions.  Despite the rigorous nature of the trek, the mug remained intact and reliably delivered hot drinks throughout the journey.  This real-world example demonstrates the product’s resilience.

<h2>Comparison with Other Insulated Backpacker Mugs</h2>

While the GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug stands out, it's beneficial to compare it with other options in the market.  Let's look at a direct comparison with the GSI Sipper Mug:

| Feature          | GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug | GSI Sipper Mug                     |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Insulation       | Excellent, with foam insulating sleeve | Good, but less robust insulation   |
| Spill Resistance | Excellent, with sealable spout       | Moderate, depending on lid closure |
| Handle           | Strap handle for backpack integration | Integrated handle, less versatile   |
| Weight           | Lightweight                          | Slightly heavier                    |
| Price            | Slightly higher                     | Slightly lower                      |


As you can see, the Infinity Backpacker Mug offers superior insulation and spill resistance, making it a more robust choice for challenging outdoor adventures.  However, the Sipper Mug might be a more budget-friendly alternative for those who prioritize cost over some features.


<h2>Conclusion: Is the GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug Right for You?</h2>

The GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug is a compelling choice for hikers, campers, and backpackers who prioritize durability, lightweight design, and eco-conscious manufacturing. Its thoughtful design, robust construction, and effective insulation make it a reliable companion for any outdoor adventure. While slightly more expensive than some alternatives, the enhanced features and longevity justify the price for those seeking a premium outdoor mug.  Its ease of use, coupled with its eco-friendly materials, makes it an excellent investment for environmentally conscious adventurers.  If you're seeking a durable, lightweight, and reliable mug that will withstand the rigors of the trail, the GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug is a strong contender.

Also thank you, Charlotte, for making your videos so entertaining, it really makes me feel less alone and time fly by while waiting for doctor appointments.

So let me start off with me( f 23)and my partner, (trans f 24 )have been engaged for 5 years out of 6 years of knowing each other after casually hitting each other up on a dating app after failed long relationships.

She just gets me like no other relationship I've ever had before and it feels like I have truly met my best friend.

Let me make a few points.
One in the beginning, my partner didn't open up to me about being trans as she was not transitioning yet and was still kind on the fence about how she would like to present herself.
Two she has never been, nor ever will be ashamed of herself or her sexual identity.
Three I'm pansexual, so whatever way that she wants to go, I am down for because I fell in love with the person, not the parts, as long as she's, healthy and happy, I could care less and have been very vocal about this to other people who have tried tare her down.

I have been VLC to NC with my biological dad, since I was 13, after years of emotional and mental abuse and him Weaponising the Bible as an answer to everything.

But I have been regular contact with my step mom as she is always wanted a daughter and was very upset with how my dad treated me, where she comes from women and girls are queens and princesses and should be treated as such. But also to keep in contact with my 2 half brothers, who I basically helped raise on the weekends during my visits, because that was what was expected of me since they were born because I was a girl.

Another pair of characters who I have kept contact with are my grandparents (his parents) because they've always told me, no matter what I have decided, they will love me because I am their granddaughter. ( that, and they both have told me multiple times when I was little that they always wanted a girl, but ended up with 3 boys, so they have doubted on me as if I was just a daughter, not just a grand daughter since I was born.) 

Well, they called me up asking if I would like to join them for Christmas Eve dinner, because my Grandpa is not doing so well health wise, the doctors have told him that he doesn't have much longer to live, and that it's a matter of when, not if he has another stroke that he will most likely not survived from it.

 So of course, I said yes, except I did express that I was not sure how I was going to get there, they live on their own property, they are farmers and live in the middle of nowhere out in the sticks, due to my own medical issues, I am not able to get a license and due to my financial state not being so good, right now, I can not even afford a car, let alone the insurance, so public transportation has been my best friend.

To which my grandmother said as long as she has her keys to her car, she is more than willing and able to come and pick me up and drop me off afterwards. 

Now comes Christmas Eve morning, I wake up to a number I didn't recognize, however, I thought for some reason that it could be my new doctor or my insurance. Trying to call me back. I've been battling trying to get in to see a new primary care that was in my area that would be covered by my insurance. (Also please forgive me, I had not yet had my coffee, so my brain wasn't fully aware that it was Christmas Eve and no random number from the doctor's office would be calling me that morning.) 

And could you guess who was on the other end of the line?
Yep, that's right, it was my bio dad, he doesn't even say hello he gets straight to the point that my grandmother had some sort of emergency at the church that she had to attend to this morning, so he would be the one picking me up with my step mom in tow to bring me to my grandparents place for Christmas Eve dinner and that he was almost to my house and to please be outside and ready to go as he wants to get to my grandparents place and then hung up on me.

Now I know this is where I should have called him back and told him to get lost, or that I'd find another way to get to my grandparents place without him having to come pick me up at 8 am when dinner was scheduled at 1pm.

However, I hesitantly gotten his car with my step mom because I really wanted to see my grandparents that, and I really wasn't fully awake.
The first ten minutes go by and it was a pleasant conversation, mainly between my step mom and I, how are things going with wedding planning? How are you liking your apartment etc. 

And then the topic I was really hoping we wouldn't be bringing up my partner, and where was she now, my step mom was calling her by her preferred pronouns and her preferred name, asking how she had been to which my bio dad stops my step mom dead in her tracks and starts berating me about he has a problem with the fact that I am dating someone who thinks that ""his God is wrong"" and that ""it's disgusting and that I am clearly mentally ill if I believe that I could have a happy life with my partner being the way that she is.""
Then went on to dead name my partner and use the wrong pronouns, telling me that that's the way my partner should live her life and that I should be forcing her to go back to her dead name and wrong pronouns if I wanted to live a ""real life. "" 

Let's just say I blew up tears streaming down my face with anger and sadness and I was about ready to jump out of the car on the highway, while he's going 75mph my step mom tried to come to my aid and tell him to shut the fuck up and that it was Christmas and to please stop making me upset, she didn't want to see me cry or hear me upset, and that today was supposed to be a happy day.

By the time we got to my grandparents place, he started telling me that he could never support my mental illness, and the way that my partner is trying to present herself is immoral and that it's not a real wedding if that is the road that we are willing to go to which I told him. I didn't want him in my wedding to begin with and that, yes, my partner is going to be at our wedding in a fucking wedding dress, and there was nothing he could do to stop her or me from going through with the marriage, and that if he was so unhappy with the fact that I am gay, he could not attend and that I would not be sending him an invitation.

Apparently my family members over heard all of what he was saying to me in my grandparents driveway, most of them agreed with me that it was disgusting, the things that he was saying, while others were telling me that it would be an asshole move if I decided to not have my father in my wedding and that they would not attend.
My grandma and my grandpa told me that they will come, no matter what, if they are still alive by then.

So would I be the asshole if I chose not to invite him and the family members who are agreeing with him to my wedding? ",4,1735273794.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,0.84,False

Instead she asks me to drive 3 hrs out of the way to some place out in the middle of nowhere to swim in a lake with gators etc and be around her husband and kids. 

The older I get I don't like justifying my choices to people. I also don't think I'm responsible for telling her of things she has done to offend me. I struggle because I care about her a lot.

Renting out your home on Airbnb can be a rewarding experience, both financially and socially. If you’re considering becoming a host, there are essential steps to ensure you set yourself up for success. From understanding the basics to creating a welcoming environment, here’s how you can navigate the Airbnb landscape with ease.

### Understand Local Regulations

Before you start listing your home, it’s crucial to check local laws regarding short-term rentals. Different cities have unique regulations that must be adhered to.

### Prepare Your Home for Guests

First impressions matter! Preparing your home involves more than just cleaning. Here are some effective strategies:

- **Deep Cleaning:** Ensure every corner of your home is spotless. Pay attention to kitchens and bathrooms, as they are areas where guests usually scrutinize cleanliness.
- **Declutter:** Remove personal items and excess clutter to create a welcoming space. This allows guests to feel comfortable and helps them envision themselves in your home.
- **Home Amenities:** Equip your space with essential amenities like fresh linens, toiletries, cooking utensils, and a coffee machine. These small touches can enhance the guest experience.

### Set the Right Price

Pricing can be tricky. You want to attract guests but also earn a fair return. Here’s how to set an optimal price:

- **Research Comparable Listings:** Look for similar properties in your area on Airbnb and observe their pricing strategies.
- **Seasonal Adjustments:** Adjust your pricing based on demand fluctuations during holidays or local events.
- **Special Discounts:** Consider offering discounts for longer stays or last-minute bookings to entice travelers.

### Create a Compelling Listing

Your listing is your first opportunity to impress potential guests. Focus on these elements:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **High-Quality Photos:** Invest in professional photographs that highlight your property’s best features. Natural light and clean spaces will make your listing pop.
- **Detailed Descriptions:** Write a clear and engaging description of your home. Mention nearby attractions, your home’s unique features, and your hosting style.
- **Catchy Title:** Craft a title that captures attention. Use keywords that describe your space, such as “Cozy Cottage with Garden View.”

### Provide Excellent Customer Service

Creating a positive experience can lead to great reviews. Make customer service a priority by:

- **Responding Quickly:** Be prompt in replying to inquiries. Quick communication can set you apart from other hosts.
- **Welcoming Guests:** If possible, greet your guests in person. A warm welcome sets a friendly tone for their stay.
- **Offering Assistance:** Provide a guidebook of local attractions, restaurants, and emergency contacts to help guests feel at home.

### Get Feedback and Adjust

Feedback from guests can be invaluable. After every stay:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Ask for Reviews:** Politely request reviews at the end of their stay. Positive reviews can boost your listing’s visibility.
- **Implement Suggestions:** If guests provide constructive feedback, consider it seriously. Making small changes can significantly improve future stays.

### Stay Legal and Protected

Ensure you protect yourself as a host. Consider these protective measures:

- **Insurance:** Check if your homeowner’s insurance covers short-term rentals. If not, consider specialized Airbnb insurance.
- **Clear House Rules:** Establish clear rules to avoid misunderstandings with guests. Provide guidelines on smoking, pets, and parties.

By following these essential steps, you can set yourself on the path to becoming a successful Airbnb host. Embrace the journey, and enjoy the benefits of sharing your home while welcoming travelers from all over the world.

Creating a Welcoming Space: Tips for Airbnb Interior Design

### Understand Your Target Audience

Before diving into design, get to know your target guests. Are they families, solo travelers, business folks, or couples? Each group has different needs and preferences, which can influence your decor choices. For example, families typically appreciate kid-friendly spaces, while business travelers might prioritize efficient workspaces.

### Prioritize Comfort

Comfort is key when it comes to your Airbnb. Start with the essentials:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Quality Bedding:** Invest in a good mattress and soft linens to ensure a restful night's sleep.
- **Functional Furniture:** Choose sofas and chairs that are both comfortable and visually appealing.
- **Temperature Control:** Make sure your space has good heating or cooling options. A fan or heater can make a world of difference!

### Create an Inviting Color Palette

Your color choices influence the overall mood of the space. Aim for warm, inviting colors that feel relaxing. Soft blues and greens promote calmness, while earthy tones create a cozy atmosphere. Limit bold colors to accents, such as throw pillows or artwork, to avoid overwhelming the senses.

### Incorporate Local Touches

Adding elements that reflect local culture can provide a unique experience for your guests. Here are a few ideas:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Local Artwork:** Hang pieces by local artists to give your space character and charm.
- **Decorative Objects:** Incorporate souvenirs or handmade crafts from the area.
- **Information Guides:** Provide books or pamphlets about local attractions, eats, and activities.

### Focus on Functional Decor

Your interior design should not only be pleasing to the eye but also functional. Consider these practical elements:

- **Smart Lighting:** Ensure adequate lighting for all areas. Use a mix of overhead lights, lamps, and natural light to create a bright, energetic atmosphere.
- **Clutter-Free Spaces:** Keep decorations minimal and organized. Too much decor can make a space feel crowded.
- **Storage Solutions:** Provide drawers or cabinets for guests to stow away their belongings comfortably.

### Optimize Outdoor Spaces

If your property has outdoor areas, make the most of them. Create a relaxing space out there by:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Comfortable Seating:** Invest in quality outdoor furniture like lounge chairs or a patio set.
- **Greenery:** Add potted plants or flowers for a refreshing touch.
- **Inviting Lighting:** String lights can create a magical ambiance in the evening.

### Maintain High Standards of Cleanliness

Cleanliness speaks volumes to guests. Ensure your home is sparkling clean before check-in. Consider hiring a professional cleaning service to maintain high standards, especially between guest stays. Always provide fresh towels and disinfect high-touch areas to enhance your guests' experience.

### Gather Feedback and Adjust Accordingly

After hosting a few guests, seek feedback on your space. Pay attention to their comments concerning comfort, amenities, and overall ambiance. Use this feedback to make necessary adjustments, whether it's adding more storage space or rethinking your decor. This ongoing process will help you refine your space and enhance the guest experience.

Creating a welcoming space for your Airbnb is both an art and a science. By incorporating thoughtful design elements, prioritizing comfort, and paying attention to your guests' needs, you can transform your home into a desirable destination. As your Airbnb success grows, you'll find that these changes not only enhance guest satisfaction but also contribute to your reputation as a fantastic host.

Navigating Local Laws and Regulations When Hosting on Airbnb
------------------------------------------------------------

Becoming an Airbnb host can be an exciting venture, but before you start welcoming guests, it's essential to navigate the local laws and regulations that apply to short-term rentals. Each city and state may have different rules, and understanding these regulations is crucial for your success and compliance.

First, you need to do your homework. Research your city's specific laws regarding short-term rentals. Some areas may allow you to rent out your entire home, while others may only permit renting a room. Here are some common regulations to look out for:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Licensing Requirements:** Many cities require you to obtain a license or permit to operate a short-term rental.
- **Occupancy Limits:** Local laws may restrict the number of guests you can host at one time.
- **Insurance Policies:** You might be mandated to have specific insurance coverage for your rental property.
- **Tax Collection:** In many areas, you may need to collect and remit a lodging tax from your guests.
- **Health and Safety Codes:** Local regulations may require you to meet health and safety standards, including smoke detectors and fire exits.

After gathering information on local regulations, the next step is to check your homeowners' association (HOA) rules, if applicable. If you live in a managed community, the HOA may have its own policies regarding short-term rentals. Violating these rules could lead to fines or even eviction.

Don’t forget to consult your lease agreement if you're renting your home. Some landlords have clauses that prohibit subletting without permission. If you are renting, it’s imperative to get written consent from your landlord before listing the property on Airbnb.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
As you navigate these regulations, consider joining local host groups or forums. Connecting with other Airbnb hosts in your area can offer valuable insights and support. They can help you understand how to comply with local laws and share their experiences, successful strategies, and challenging situations.

Sometimes local regulations can change rapidly. To stay informed, regularly check city council meetings or local government websites. Sign up for newsletters or alerts that provide updates on short-term rental laws. Making sure you are informed about any changes can save you from potential issues down the line.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
It’s also wise to familiarize yourself with the Airbnb platform’s policies. Although Airbnb provides some guidance on local laws, it ultimately rests on you to ensure compliance. Read through Airbnb’s resources on regulations and follow the best practices they recommend.

In some cities, you'll find that regulations have been put in place to protect local communities. Consider these actions you can take to foster good relations with neighbors:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Communication:** Inform neighbors about your short-term rental plans. Creating a good relationship can go a long way.
- **No Party Policy:** Establish clear house rules regarding parties and noise to reduce disturbance in your neighborhood.
- **Review Feedback:** Regularly read your guest reviews to ensure you're maintaining a high standard of service, which can also reflect positively in your community.

As you get started, it’s essential to keep organized records. Document any permits obtained, taxes collected, and correspondence with your city or HOA. This will not only help you stay compliant but will also provide you with important data for future adjustments to your rental strategy.

Remember that being a responsible host goes beyond just following regulations. You have an impact on your community, so consider how to rent out your home with integrity. This approach will not only benefit you in avoiding fines and issues but will also contribute to a positive reputation as a host.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
By thoroughly understanding and adhering to local laws and regulations, you can set the foundation for a successful Airbnb hosting experience. This attention to detail will ensure that you provide a welcoming environment for your guests while remaining a good neighbor in your community.

Setting the Right Price: Strategies for Competitive Airbnb Listings
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting the right price for your Airbnb listing is critical. It can make or break your success as a host. If the price is too high, you might scare away potential guests. If it’s too low, you might miss out on maximizing your profits. Here are several effective strategies to help you find that sweet spot.

### Understand Your Market

First, research your local market. Look at similar listings in your area. Pay attention to:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Location:** How close is your property to major attractions or transport links?
- **Size and amenities:** What facilities do competitors offer? Pools, Wi-Fi, or free parking can significantly influence pricing.
- **Seasonality:** Tourist seasons can impact demand. Prices might soar during holidays and local events.

You can use Airbnb’s built-in pricing tools to compare your listing against others. This will help you understand the going rates and what guests are willing to pay.

### Consider Your Costs

You should factor in all your expenses when setting your pricing. This includes:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Mortgage or rent:** Make sure this is covered by your earnings.
- **Utilities:** Water, electricity, gas, and internet costs should be considered.
- **Maintenance:** Keep a budget for repairs and cleaning.

Understanding your baseline costs is crucial in ensuring that you earn enough through your Airbnb listing.

### Set a Competitive Daily Rate

Once you know the market and your costs, it’s time to set a competitive daily rate. Consider the following:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Dynamic pricing:** Adjust your rates based on demand. Higher prices can be charged during peak seasons while offering discounts during slower periods.
- **Minimum stay requirements:** Set a minimum night stay during busy times to maximize your earnings.
- **Special offers:** Offering discounts for longer stays can attract guests looking for extended vacations.

Tools like AirDNA can provide valuable insights and help you decide on the best pricing strategy based on real-time data.

### Engage with Guest Reviews

Guest reviews can also influence your pricing strategy. Take note of comments about value for money. If guests consistently rave about your space and mention that they would pay more, you may want to consider a price adjustment. Alternatively, if feedback indicates that your listing is lacking in certain aspects compared to competitors, it may be wise to lower your price until improvements are made.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Seasonal Adjustments

Seasonality plays a pivotal role in pricing. During peak travel seasons, you might increase your rates by 20-30% compared to the off-season. Additionally, consider local events that could impact your area’s popularity. Set calendar reminders for these events and adjust your prices accordingly, ensuring maximum reservation potential during busy times.

### Test and Learn

Don’t be afraid to experiment. Start with one price point, then adjust based on occupancy rates. If you find that your listing is booked consistently, consider increasing the price incrementally. Conversely, if you’re not getting inquiries, it’s time to lower your rates.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Offer Unique Value

To stand out, consider adding extras that justify a higher price. Offer personal touches like:

- Local recommendations for dining and activities.
- Free bicycles or beach gear.
- Complimentary snacks or drinks upon arrival.

These small perks can enhance the overall guest experience and justify your pricing.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Utilize Airbnb Tools

Airbnb offers various tools designed to help you manage pricing effectively:

- **Smart Pricing:** Automatically adjusts your rates based on demand and competition.
- **Price tips:** Provides insights on optimal pricing based on real-time data.
- **Promotions:** Create discounts or special offers to increase bookings.

Using these tools can save you time and potentially increase your bookings.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
By employing these strategies, you can set the right price for your Airbnb listing. Remember, constant monitoring and adjustments based on market conditions, guest feedback, and cost changes are vital for ongoing success.

Managing Guest Relations: Best Practices for Communication and Reviews
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Managing guest relations effectively can make your Airbnb hosting experience both rewarding and smooth. Open communication and proactive guest management are crucial for creating positive experiences that lead to great reviews and repeat bookings. Here are some best practices to enhance your guest relations:

### Be Proactive with Communication

From the moment a guest books your property, start setting the tone with clear communication. Acknowledge their booking right away, and provide essential details. This fosters confidence and lets them know you’re a reliable host. Consider including:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- Check-in instructions
- Your contact information
- House rules
- Local attractions and tips

When guests know what to expect, they are less likely to feel anxious or overwhelmed upon arrival.

### Be Responsive

Timing is everything. Respond promptly to inquiries, whether it’s a booking request or a question during their stay. If a guest messages you, aim to reply within an hour if possible. This shows that you care about their experience.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
If a problem arises during their stay, acknowledge it quickly. Addressing issues with urgency can often turn a negative experience into a positive one, leading to better reviews. Regardless of whether the issue is major or minor, your quick response will leave a positive impression.

### Encourage Feedback

After your guests check out, don’t shy away from asking for feedback. Send them a thank-you message and request their thoughts on their stay. You can phrase it in a friendly manner, such as, “I hope you had a wonderful time! If you have a moment, I’d love to hear your feedback.”

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
Not only does this show you value their opinion, but it also gives you insights to improve your hosting experience for future guests.

### Manage Reviews Gracefully

Reviews play a central role in attracting future guests. Aim to achieve a high rating, but remember that not every guest experience will be perfect. If you receive negative feedback, respond professionally and thoughtfully. Thank the guest for their review and acknowledge their concerns. Offer a solution or clarify any misunderstandings. This demonstrates that you care about your guests' experiences and are willing to improve.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
Here are some strategies for effectively managing reviews:

- **Stay Calm:** When faced with criticism, take a moment to breathe before responding.
- **Be Professional:** Avoid arguing or getting emotional—maintain a friendly tone.
- **Acknowledge the Issue:** Let guests know you appreciate their feedback and will work on their concerns.
- **Encourage Positive Reviews:** After a great stay, suggest guests leave a review. They may need a little nudge!

### Personal Touches Count

Adding personal touches can enhance guest experience and encourage positive feedback. A handwritten note or a small welcome gift can go a long way in making guests feel special. Consider local snacks or a guidebook with personalized recommendations. These thoughtful gestures make guests feel valued and appreciated.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Follow Up After Their Stay

Once your guests have checked out, a follow-up message can solidify their positive experience. Ask how their journey went and if they need anything else. You can also ensure they received your thank-you message for staying at your property. This open line of communication keeps you fresh in their minds for future trips.

### Stay Professional at All Times

Remember that while you want to be friendly, you also need to maintain professionalism. Create boundaries to ensure that communication remains respectful and efficient. Guests appreciate hosts who are approachable but also know how to keep things organized.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
By following these best practices for managing guest relations, you can enhance the overall experience for both you and your guests. Keeping communication open, being responsive, and handling reviews gracefully will not only lead to positive outcomes but also increase your chances of becoming a Superhost. Success in the short-term rental business lies in your ability to manage relationships, creating memorable stays for guests from around the world.

### Conclusion

Successfully renting out your home as an Airbnb host can be a rewarding venture, both personally and financially.

In 2022 I found myself in $4k of CC debt (started with medical bills I was dumb enough to put on a card, then Christmas gifts, then spiraled from there), so I completed a 0% balance transfer which only covered about 2/3 of my total debts. I didn’t stop spending on my cards for very long after that, and I didn’t pay off the 0% card in time to take full advantage of the zero interest. The total CC debt stayed around $4k with my spending habits despite paying more than the minimums every month.

So then in 2023 I decided to refinance my car and expand it to add in the $4k in CC debt. I thought that would take care of it, but here I am now in $6k of CC debt a year later. The worst part is that my money was spent on little dumb things like groceries, coffee, and work lunches, with frivolous spending on clothes/personal items very infrequently. Like, wtf?

I truly feel like I have had a wake up call that is different than the last two. I told my partner about these debts for the first time (it didn’t go over well), to add some more accountability and to finally get it off my chest as it was really keeping me so ashamed. I have made a habit to look at my bank account every single day, which is big for me as I avoided it out of anxiety. I froze all my credit cards, cut up the physical cards (all except the Apple Card because it’s made of metal - how do I destroy this thing?!), picked up a third job, I have a detailed budget for the first time in my life, and I’m excited to pay off this debt with nothing but my hard work and income - not utilizing another get-out-of-jail-free card like the 0% or the refi. 

All of this does signal some real change in me, but I’m still so afraid that this spending behavior will happen again. I’m not sure yet of my spending triggers, if it’s emotional spending or just because I was too dumb/dissociated to budget until now. I didn’t have this fear the last two times I bailed myself out, so maybe that’s a good sign? Any encouragement or helpful advice is great. TIA!",7,1735273246.0,personalfinance,7,0.82,False
1hn6qd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateDayFasting/comments/1hn6qd2/one_week_in_and_there_has_been_no_change_in_my/,"One week in, and there has been no change in my weight.","I did intermittent fasting before, mostly for 18–22 hours, to lose a few pounds. However, this year was quite tough, and I went through the worst time, which led to gaining 20 pounds.

I am 32 years old, female, weighing 154 lbs, and I want to lose 24 pounds. I started Alternate Day Fasting (ADF) last Friday but kept the weekends as non-fasting days since I usually have outings or get-togethers planned.

I have been checking my weight daily. On day one, I lost 2.5 pounds, but the weight came back after the weekend. After two fasting days (Monday and Wednesday), I see almost no change in my weight—maybe a 1-pound loss at most.

I’ve been having coffee with non-fat milk and one boiled egg at the 24-hour mark because it gets too tough to control my hunger at that point. What should I do? Why am I not losing weight faster? The only reason I started ADF was to achieve fast weight loss.",1,1735273243.0,AlternateDayFasting,0,0.99,False

But from time to time, I don’t feel like giving a dissertation to justify a post, I just want a quick casual post with some back and forth banter from like-minded individuals. So, in that spirit, are any of you doing the Trade subscription? We’ve been using it for about 7 months now, more hits than misses, this was Good Citizen, Ceiba. We’ve really enjoyed it, used it for an eggnog cappuccino on Christmas yesterday.

Beginning with making the Panthers into a nice taxidermy before exposing them Cowboys as frauds will have any team looking good. Unfortunately, you then had to play some real teams. 3-10 after a 2-0 start is quite putrid. Injuries have crippled your team, especially at quarterback. You know it's bad when SPENCER RATTLER is starting games. As a final send-off after your elimination, the Packers goose egged you and extended the NFL's streak of never having a season without a shoutout. You have to blow it up at this point, but it won't happen because your executives suck. Enjoy your stay in hell.

San Francisco 49ers (FULL FUCKING SHANAHAN!) \[recommended audio: California Dreamin'\] - WHY?! FUCKING WHY?! You fuckers knew this was likely your last chance before Big Cock Brock's massive payday. And for what? Brandon Aiyuk held out for a big payment, did jack diddly squat, and was then struck down by the football gods. CMC was broken for most of the year, injuries have crippled your roster, and Purdy has been left running around like a cock with its head cut off. Gone absolutely flaccid. The Kyle Shanahan cycle has repeated itself. He's fucking snake bitten, forever cursed to either come up short at the last moment or be unable to get out of first gear. Conglaturations, 49ers. Prepare for cap hell when you give Purdy that massive truckload of money.

Arizona Cardinals (You Can Fire A Fraud, But That Doesn't Mean You're Not The Fraudinals) \[recommended audio: I'm Like a Bird\] - Remember when the Cardinals were leading the NFC West for a cup of coffee? Football is hilarious sometimes. We then remembered that they are still, in fact, the Fraudinals. Kyler Murray just can't carry this team to relevance, no matter how hard he tries. The coup de grace? Losing to Carolina in overtime to kill your playoff hopes. Fucking pathetic. Get out of my sight.

Dallas Cowboys (HOOOOOOOOOOOOW BOUT THEM COOOOOOOOOWBOOOOOOOOOYS!) \[recommended audio: ""Dallas"" intro music\] - HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! YOU FUCKERS ARE ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC! ALL IN PUSH? MY ASS! WHAT A FUCKING DISASTER! GETTING ABSOLUTELY CREAMED BY THE SAINTS, COMMITTING SUDOKU AGAINST THE EAGLES, DAK GETTING INJURED AGAIN, YOUR OLD GUARD DISOWNING YOU, FUCKING HILARIOUS! THE BEST PART? YOU ACTUALLY DECIDE TO PLAY TO YOUR POTENTIAL AFTER YOU GOT ELIMINATED! FALCONS FANS ARE THANKING YOU FOR FUCKING OVER TAMPA BAY! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW BOUT THEM COOOOOOOOOOOOOOWBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOYS!",2,1735272956.0,UrinatingTree,0,1.0,False
