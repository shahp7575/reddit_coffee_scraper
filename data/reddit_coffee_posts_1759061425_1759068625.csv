1nsp8zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nsp8zu/i_30f_ended_up_spending_the_night_with_the/,I 30F ended up spending the night with the general manager 46M after meeting him at a local event. Now what?,"When I was 23 and got my first real job at a big company - corporate, there was this guy who was the plant manager and later became the general manager. We didn't have much in common. I was on entry level position. The company had around 700 people hired locally. And he was the top guy. We heard stories of him being very harsh and uptight, strict, mean. I had a weird crush on him even though I saw him just once face to face (Closely) - at the office coffee shop. He was very tall, had a button down shirt, short hair, blue icy eyes that were so cold and a pretty nice built. 

Only a few years later I had my first interaction with him and it happened in a meeting via Teams. he made me feel bad about a mistake my colleague did, but he didn't care and just took it all out on me, raised his voice, talked down to me, asked me questions like: are you capable to at least follow what I am telling you?"" I felt so bad and ashamed. He didn't allow me to speak, he kept cutting me off with mean remarks. Finally I resigned, but not because of this, unrelated reasons.

Now I am 30 and he is 46 and we met randomly at a local event. He didn't remember me but when I told him my name he was like: you that girl that told me to watch my tone (he was friendly). I said, yeah. We kept talking for another 20 minutes. Then he invited me for a drink at the bar. He said he remembers the incident and said he feels very sorry for it. Managerial positions are very stressful and sometimes he loses his temper but is working on it to happen less often. I ended up at his place and we had sex. I didn't spend the night.

I asked the next day a woman who works there if he has changed since then (I didn' tell her what happened) and she said he is even worse. So he didn't probably say the truth. Well, but now I keep thinking about this. He did not ask for a contact detail from me so I guess he doesn't want to hear of me anymore. Would it be too much if I followed him on Linkedin? He is divorced btw for a very long time",1,1759068478.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1759068260.0,ThePhantom,0,0.5,False

I know na may coin deposit machine na ang bsp sa mga ilang sm but I want to know if aside sa pagdeposit at pwede pa ibayad ito sa mga mga supermarkets, pwede ba ibayad mga centavo coins sa ibang paraan like

2. Bus commute (e.g. edsa carousel)
3. Fast food/coffee chains

This might sound stupid pero nahihiya talaga ako magbayad ng mga centavo kasi parang di na masyado ginagamit except sa panukli lang.

1nsp443,https://www.reddit.com/r/BirthOfCivilization/comments/1nsp443/meaning_of_human_civilization/,meaning of human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1759068136.0,BirthOfCivilization,0,1.0,False

Throw away account . Typing fast from my phone . I‚Äôll answer any questions after my meeting .

I ( M, 41) have been with my wife( F,37) for 6 years. We have a 3 year old daughter. My wife decided to be a SAHM after our baby was born and didn‚Äôt go back to work after her maternity leave ended ( we live in Canada ). We divide the housework and childcare equally. I watch the baby 2 nights a week so she can go to the gym for a little mental health break. I asked her if I can have one night a week quiet time. She asked what is that? I said just pretend I‚Äôm not here! I‚Äôll be in our room reading or listening to music for one hour only. She agreed.

Every single time she came to our room either to talk or tell me that she was bored. When I reminded her about our deal she got upset and said I was making excuses to avoid spending time with her.

Another time, I told her then I would be going to the local coffee shop to read and just one hour of quiet time. My wife decided to do a surprise visit there. She said baby wanted to surprise her daddy. I smiled and said I just wanted a little quiet time. She sat down and talked so loud I had to say let‚Äôs just go home. 

This time I decided to go to the public library. My wife asked where I was going I told her I hadn‚Äôt decided yet but as per our deal it‚Äôs my night. She got upset because I was refusing to share where I was going. That one hour quiet time was heavenly. No one called my name and I came back home so happy. 

When I came home my wife was furious! She said she wanted to check my phone then asked if I was seeing or talking to anyone. I laughed. I said I was at the library you can ask the librarians if they saw me. She has been really cold to me and says I should have shared my location since she does ( well I know she goes to the gym). Was I a jerk for refusing to share where I was? I decided to stay longer at work in future and take advantage of quiet office since now my wife know about the library

>the post is written in a way that paints you in the best of lights. ‚Äú we divide the housework and childcare equally. I watched the baby two nights a week so she can go to the gym for a little mental health break‚Äù. I‚Äôll give you the benefit of the doubt regarding the housework, but the childcare if she‚Äôs a SAHM she has your child seven days a week. And you are maybe helping her five nights a week and the other two nights you graciously allow her to go to the gym. Since this post is regarding whether you‚Äôre a jerk or not for sharing your location with your wife. NTJ. If the post had been a different question, you would definitely be a massive jerk.

[**Quick update - not sharing the location with my wife**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1kh40mz/quick_update_not_sharing_the_location_with_my_wife/) 

I got so many dm asking if I talked to her ? And why I needed alone time ? Because It really makes a difference in my mental health status . I really don‚Äôt know what to do. She is now fully convinced I‚Äôm having an affair . In her conspiracy plot I need alone time because I resent her and I was alone with some AP that night. 

She refuses to even have a calm conversation with me.I told her I can have my quiet time at home if it puts her mind at ease only if she promises not to interrupt me. She made a snarky comment that what would my AP thinks. I just stopped trying to convince her . Things have been rocky. I have no plan of taking my quiet time anymore ( at least until things get better ).

Ps : example of how she interrupts my alone time at home ‚Ä¶ One time I was lying in bed watching the re-run of an old sitcom on our bedroom tv. Just to decompress. She opened the door asking what I was watching . I said Seinfeld. Then she sat down and kept saying how boring and over rated this show was. Then went on saying how Jerry Seinfeld is a gross man . Then she said this show is not even funny. Then on and on. 

I told her I wasn‚Äôt watching the show for educational purposes üòÇ she said I could be watching a decent show together now but you chose to watch this crap. I said we do that every night after we put the baby to bed. She said then why wasting your time watching this ‚Ä¶ I just turned off tv ..I was done

[**Update2- not sharing my location with my wife**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1kj72hl/update2_not_sharing_my_location_with_my_wife/) 

My life has been a living hell. I checked her phone. There was nothing suspicious. She had a long conversation with her best friend about how she knows I‚Äôm cheating and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm avoiding her and want alone time.

She said she was frustrated because she couldn‚Äôt prove it but she just knew. Her best friend told her to trust her heart. I tried multiple times to sit her down and talk to her but it ended up her yelling at me and she is being more upset. She is very cold to me and avoids any conversations with me.

Mentally, I‚Äôm a mess. I wanted to go for a long walk yesterday . I told her where I was going . She rolled her eyes and said more ‚Äúalone times ‚Äú? Or mistress misses you ? I decided not to go. I really don‚Äôt know how to prove myself . I gave up on any alone time . She doesn‚Äôt even talk to me so date nights are gone too. I ruined my marriage over one quiet alone reading time at the library .

Added later : she doesn‚Äôt go to the gym anymore. I asked her why? She said ‚Äú why do you care? You were planning to bring your mistress home when I‚Äôm not home?‚Äù.

[**Final update : not sharing my location with my wife**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1klmyfo/final_update_not_sharing_my_location_with_my_wife/) 

I tried to make Mother‚Äôs Day special for her. I made a hand print homemade card with our kid for her. We ( our kid and I but technically from our kid) made special breakfast for her. She said thanks to our kid and hugged her but things were the same between us. I was planning to BBQ for dinner. I realized I needed to replace the propane tank. 

I told her I was going to buy one. I was stupid enough to stop by at the local French bakery to buy special dessert for Mother‚Äôs Day. There was a line up but I thought it worth it since they have her favourite dessert and it would be a nice surprise for her. When I came home my wife lost it. She started screaming that I was out with my mistress that‚Äôs why it took so long . 

I showed her the dessert she grabbed it from my hand and threw it in the trash said it‚Äôs a cover for my affair. I told her how on earth I could possibly had met my hypothetical mistress and bought this in less than an hour. She told me she was done. She grabbed our kid and left. She has been staying at her parents. I tried contacting her but she doesn‚Äôt reply. I guess the next step is talking to an attorney about shared custody .

[**New update on my life - not sharing the location with my wife**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1mxcvb2/new_update_on_my_life_not_sharing_the_location/) 

I spoke with an attorney like I mentioned before. For now, things are moving toward setting up a custody arrangement, and I‚Äôll also have to pay alimony and child support since she has no source of income. She is staying at our place, but she does let me visit our kid, which I‚Äôm thankful for. She still says I broke the family by being selfish and not fighting for it. I feel guilty because I wish I could be with my kid all the time. Questioning myself that maybe I was selfish ?? It‚Äôs heartbreaking, but it seems like my wife has made up her mind.

I‚Äôve also started individual therapy, because I realized I can‚Äôt control her suspicions or rebuild trust by myself if she isn‚Äôt willing. What I can control is how I show up for my kid and how I handle this whole situation.

For the record: I never cheated on her, and no, I‚Äôm not seeing anyone now. I honestly have no idea what‚Äôs going on with her at this point. I‚Äôm not sure if she is seeing anyone but that‚Äôs none of my business anyways . My focus is entirely on my kid and making sure she feels loved and supported

No one should ever have to deal with unfounded accusations. Does she really not understand you just wanted one hour to yourself since she gets alone time?? She should, she agreed. This is 100% her fault. It's really pathetic she couldn't handle not bothering you for one hour. If she could have followed thought with what she agreed to, none of that would have happened. You sure she wasn't screwing someone during her alone time ??

And if you have a pastor, rabbi, etc I recommend you visit with that person, too, to help your spirit find comfort as you rebuild your life, as well.

1nsp278,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGenius/comments/1nsp278/whats_meaning_of_human_life/,what's meaning of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1759068014.0,TheGenius,0,0.5,False
1nsp23a,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1nsp23a/anxiety_and_vyvanse/,Anxiety and Vyvanse,"I've been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder since I was like 12, so I've always been a really anxious person. I started taking Vyvanse instead of Concerta last month because about an hour after taking Concerta I'd be so tired that I'd basically be nonfunctioning all day. 

Since taking the Vyvanse, I've noticed that after about an hour my anxiety ramps WAY up. Like, I'm basically in an anxiety attack until it wears off in the afternoon. Is this a common thing and does it go away after awhile? I don't want to swap medications again because the Vyvanse is actually really helping me be productive when I'm not paralyzed by the anxiety. 

I've also noticed that if I have a coffee after the anxiety starts it actually helps reduce the anxiety, but I don't really want to mix the two if it's going to hurt my heart or blood pressure or something. ",1,1759068007.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1nsp1kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nsp1kh/request_for_advice_on_how_to_support_my_40nb_afab/,"Request for advice on how to support my (40nb, afab) partner (40m) in dealing with his rude brother (38m) and how to proceed with him myself- do my tactics seem based?","Hi Redditors- my partner is sad tonight after once again seeing his brother behave badly. Let‚Äôs call my partner Lars. Brother (let‚Äôs call him Andy) is a stressy, volatile kind of a person who has refused anger management and therapy despite his family encouraging it. Lars is quiet, calm person who has had a therapist for years. Andy is larger, and physically intimidating compared Lars. Andy‚Äôs like 6 foot one- I‚Äôd guess 220 pounds, and Lars has a more slight build at 5 foot eight, 140 pounds. 

Andy has a typical corporate job, whereas Lars and I are self-employed professional artists with a somewhat ‚Äúglamorous life on paper‚Äù - any professional artists here will know what I mean. Andy has two young children and a wife who also has a corporate job. It was not Andy‚Äôs dream to have kids, more something he knew he had to do to keep his wife. He is a frustrated writer and had expressed jealousy of Lars‚Äôs profession in the arts. So part of his blowback toward us seems to be his jealousy and frustration. We work late, often into the wee hours. Being professional musicians is essentially shift work, going on stage late at night or having to drive long distances after shows. Andy makes a point of being loud and waking my partner up early when he can. 

Andy erupted at me once in the context of a board game and I decided I‚Äôm never playing a game with him again. We were teaching Andy this really fun game, and he decided I‚Äôd made an unfair move, all evidence aside. I‚Äôm not here to be his target. I didn‚Äôt have a conversation about it with him. I just backed off. He freaked out in his own home, and I wasn‚Äôt going to chide him there or anywhere really. I had only met him a couple times at that point. 

Next incident: Andy blew up at Lars at their father‚Äôs funeral. He literally said ‚Äúmy dad just died‚Äù as if it wasn‚Äôt Lars‚Äôs father‚Äôs funeral too. Andy had been shushing people around the back of the house, where his son was taking a nap. The walls of the house were two feet thick though, and Lars pointed that out. You can‚Äôt hear anything through those walls. Andy went on to apologize to Lars multiple times that day. 

Then on Lars‚Äôs birthday Andy went out of his way to be rude to me. Lars said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on speaker phone with OP‚Äù and Andy said hello to my dog and not me. In that moment I saw how far gone he is, that he is using me as a target for plausible deniability as a way to punch his brother. I decided in that moment to never stay with Andy again (he has a big house and often offers his spot when we travel to see the family.) Lars was really bummed out after his brother snubbed me on his birthday. 

I don‚Äôt want to intrude on what‚Äôs a personal problem between my partner and his brother. I also don‚Äôt want to be a target. So I‚Äôve just removed myself in as much as possible. 

Andy has this super odd, rigid communication style with me where he only talks to me about coffee (which I don‚Äôt care about) and if I try to have a normal conversation he does not respond. I think he‚Äôs only slightly less rigid in his conversation style with Lars. 

I have a very lovely relationship with their mother. Andy is snippy with his wife as well as his mother and brother- he boils over at everyone on a regular basis. 

Recent incident: Lars visited Andy while he was traveling for work and saw the name of our city on the calendar. Andy revealed he was visiting our city but hadn‚Äôt planned on telling us. Lars was bummed Andy wasn‚Äôt trying to see him. 

Most recent incident: tonight Andy did it again, not saying hello to me in a speaker phone call. I don‚Äôt want to insert myself if he doesn‚Äôt want to say hello so I didn‚Äôt speak. 

Does anyone have any advice about how I can support my partner in dealing with his brother? 

I plan on staying formal and distant as possible if Andy‚Äôs poor behavior continues. I will avoid staying at Andy‚Äôs house in the future. We want to maintain as close and positive a relationship as possible in order to be there as uncle/aunt figures to the niblings. Lars and his mother make it clear to Andy‚Äôs wife that we see his behavior and they‚Äôre here to support her. All of them try to encourage Andy to get therapy and or do anger management and he does not want to go. 

When Andy first met me, he was only father of one, maybe a little less stressed, and he was more pleasant. I think he‚Äôs an interesting person, and I give him the benefit of the doubt that he is more than his coping mechanisms, better than his worst behavior. But I refuse to be a punching bag to him, so I‚Äôll back off as much as possible. 

Any constructive advice is appreciated. Thank you. ",1,1759067970.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1nsp0nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/renegades/comments/1nsp0nv/where_is_the_meaning_of_life/,where is the meaning of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1759067901.0,renegades,0,1.0,False
1nsp0nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nsp0nh/explore_the_best_smart_mug_ember_and_see_if_it/,Explore the best smart mug Ember and see if it truly keeps coffee hot,"Testing the Ember CM191000US smart mug daily has been a surprisingly enjoyable experience for me. From the first use, it genuinely felt like a piece of modern technology seamlessly improving an everyday task‚Äîkeeping my coffee at the perfect temperature. The Ember Coffee Mug 2, with its sleek black design, is more than just a simple cup; it‚Äôs a blend of style, functionality, and that slight touch of tech-savvy charm. This 10 oz gem is meant for all coffee or tea enthusiasts who dislike the inevitable moment their hot beverage turns lukewarm.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is undeniably attractive. The black exterior has a smooth, modern finish with a scratch-resistant coating that still looks pristine even after several weeks of daily use. A perk I didn‚Äôt expect, but soon appreciated, is its heat-resistant and unbreakable material. It‚Äôs anything but fragile, something I accidentally tested when I knocked it off my desk (whoops!). The rounded shape is ergonomic, and it doesn‚Äôt feel bulky to hold. The 10 oz size perfectly fits my morning coffee portion, though I imagine heavy coffee drinkers might find themselves wishing for a larger capacity.  

**Smart With or Without App**  
I‚Äôve tried it with the Ember app and without, and honestly? Both work seamlessly. Pairing the mug with the app was straightforward. Using the companion app, I could quickly set my ideal temperature (a comfortable 135¬∞F for me), and it remembered this preference without needing constant tweaking. The app also allows you to create presets, which I found especially useful when switching between tea, coffee, and my occasional attempt at warming up herbal concoctions. Even when I didn‚Äôt use the app, the mug stayed functional, heating to that sweet spot automatically.  

[Check Ember CM191000US price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b07nqrm6ml/)  

**Auto Sleep Functionality**  
The auto-sleep feature is brilliant. I‚Äôm an absent-minded coffee drinker at times and often leave mugs half-full for hours. This smart mug has a form of intelligence‚Äîit enters sleep mode after 2 hours of inactivity or when empty, saving battery. It automatically wakes up when it senses liquid or movement. This isn‚Äôt just clever; it‚Äôs convenient and energy-efficient.  

**Battery Life and Charging**  
The advertised 80-minute battery life isn‚Äôt an exaggeration. If I sip my coffee leisurely, I don‚Äôt feel rushed to finish before it cools down. On busier mornings where that extended heat isn‚Äôt enough, the redesigned charging coaster steps in beautifully. By placing it on the coaster, I‚Äôve enjoyed an all-day warm beverage without even thinking about the battery. That little charging base is sleek and doesn‚Äôt take up too much space on my kitchen counter or desk. However, I wouldn‚Äôt complain if the battery life could stretch closer to two hours on its own.  

**Easy Maintenance**  
Hand washing is required for this mug, but I didn‚Äôt find it to be a hurdle. The updated scratch-resistant coating on the surface makes you feel okay scrubbing it a bit without thinking you‚Äôll ruin the appearance. Its IPX7 rating means it‚Äôs fully submersible up to one meter, but tossing it in the dishwasher isn‚Äôt an option‚Äîsomething I had to remind my enthusiastic teenager when they kindly offered to help clean up.  

**Good Points**  
- Sleek, scratch-resistant design that looks stylish in any setting.  
- Auto-sleep mode conserves battery and intelligently manages power.  
- Compatible with or without the app, fitting varying tech preferences.  
- Includes a reliable charging coaster for extended all-day usage.  
- Maintains chosen drink temperature between 120¬∞F - 145¬∞F to perfection.  

**Deficiencies**  
- The 10 oz capacity might feel restrictive for larger drink portions.  
- No dishwasher compatibility means you‚Äôll need to hand wash it.  

**Challengers**  
Compared to other smart mugs on the market, the Ember Coffee Mug 2 stands out with its attention to detail. Similar products from brands like Cauldryn and HyperChiller might boast features such as larger capacities or faster cooling, but they often miss the mark on sustained temperature control. For example, while the Cauldryn mug has impressive heating power, its bulky design and lack of sleek aesthetics make it less practical for everyday use. The Ember, on the other hand, maintains the right balance of functionality and style, fitting seamlessly into modern life.  

**Value for Money**  
While the price point might seem steep for what‚Äôs essentially a coffee mug, the combination of thoughtful features and stylish design makes it feel worth every penny. Considering the precise temperature control, the durable construction, and the helpful app integration, this mug doesn‚Äôt just warm beverages‚Äîit elevates the whole experience. It delivers affordable quality for those willing to prioritize comfort and convenience in their daily routines. If you‚Äôre debating whether the investment aligns with your needs, it‚Äôs worth considering how often you find yourself reheating coffee in the microwave or drinking half-hearted lukewarm tea.

1nsozo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1nsozo9/should_you_trust_juniper_clean_for_the_best/,Should You Trust Juniper CLEAN for the Best Surface Wipes Cleaning,"The Juniper CLEAN B08HSG9NZ6 surface wipes bring convenience, functionality, and a touch of freshness to everyday cleaning routines. As someone who constantly battles spills, smudges, and general grime‚Äîboth in my kitchen and bathroom‚Äîhaving an effective all-purpose cleaning product is crucial. This pack of 72 durable wipes seems to hit the mark on several fronts, but perfection isn‚Äôt exactly the word I‚Äôd choose to describe them. Still, there are plenty of standout elements worth mentioning.

**Design and Convenience**  
Right out of the gate, the overall design of this product caught my attention. The soft pack is compact enough to be tossed in a drawer or carried around in a bag if needed. Unlike hard cases for cleaning wipes that take up more room and sometimes dry out quickly after a few uses, this resealable pack managed to keep the contents moist for weeks. Each wipe measures 6.3""x6.3"", which is a practical size for small or medium cleanup tasks‚Äîbut when I had a larger surface like my dining table, sometimes one wipe didn‚Äôt feel like enough.  

[Check Juniper CLEAN B08HSG9NZ6 price on Amazon.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b08hsg9nz6/)

**Durability That Actually Surprises**  
What stood out after my first use was how strong these wipes are. Many other brands I've tried in the past start to shred when scrubbing sticky messes. Not here. Thanks to their textured, lint-free design, these little guys seemed ready to take on granite countertops, stainless steel finishes, and even rough wooden shelves without much struggle. Despite their bleach-based formula, though, they caused no harm to my granite counters. But heads up: make sure it doesn‚Äôt touch fabrics unless you‚Äôre okay risking stains or discoloration. My son brought a wipe too close to a hand towel, and let‚Äôs just say we now have a bleached spot forever gracing that towel‚Äôs corner.  

**Fresh Scent‚ÄîRefreshing in Moderation**  
Nothing beats a product keeping things clean *and* smelling good. These surface wipes leave behind a pleasantly light and fresh scent, which is particularly handy when dealing with musty smells or cooking odors in the kitchen. That said, there were conflicting opinions among my family members about this ""fresh"" aroma‚Äîwhile I found it energizing, my partner thought it clashed a tiny bit with the lavender room spray we often use. Personal preferences, I guess.  

**Field Tested in Real-Life Chaos**  
These wipes have seen it all in my home. In my kitchen, they tackled tomato sauce splatters and cooking oil spills like champs. The bleach certainly delivers on its promise of cutting through grime and grease effectively. Meanwhile, in the bathroom, these were the go-to solution for countertops, stained tile grout, and even chrome fixtures. Pro tip: regular use on faucets keeps them looking shiny and new. Beyond the walls of home, I've stashed a pack under my office desk for those accidental coffee spills. Also, they‚Äôve proven to be good companions during our road trips, cleaning up snack-related messes in our car.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact, resealable packaging preserves moisture effectively  
- Durable, textured wipes that resist tearing  
- Lint-free design ensures no residue is left behind  
- Efficient for both light everyday touchups and tougher grime   
- Added fresh scent helps create a clean atmosphere  

**Limitations**  
- May bleach or discolor fabrics if not handled carefully  
- Scent preference varies between people  
- Packs of 72 might feel insufficient for heavy daily use  

**Competing Products**  
Cleaning wipes are certainly not a rare item in the market. Compared to other options like Clorox or Lysol wipes, these hold their own when it comes to durability and versatility. However, those competitors often offer larger packs, making them better suited for larger households or heavy usage. Where this item excels over its rivals is portability and efficiency‚Äîlighter to carry yet still effective. A downside compared to others is slightly fewer chemical options geared toward sensitive users, as this product strictly targets tough messes with its bleach content.  

**Value for Money**  
Considering what this pack brings to the table, it‚Äôs actually a pretty solid deal for most scenarios. Its durability makes it last longer, even when tackling serious grime, and the resealable pack makes sure none of the wipes goes to waste. Don‚Äôt expect miracles, especially if you‚Äôre planning heavy-duty cleaning across multiple rooms, but for everyday spills and touch-ups, they absolutely strike the right balance of quality for the price.

1nsoyru,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nsoyru,"Thinking of this, any suggestions?","Hi everyone, 

This will be my first used car purchase. So I would really appreciate any suggestions, do‚Äôs and don‚Äôt s. 

A bit of a background, we need a 7seater car that we can still fit a double pram (bugaboo donkey to be precise) whilst having all seats up due to our expanding family. We have looked at Lexus RX-L, Toyota highlander, XC90, defender, xtrail, shogun, seat terraco, Kia Sorento, GLB. Some had tiniest booth space with all seats up. I could not fully decide between a Sorento, XC90 and this Genesis GV80. Price wise and specs, this GV80 is making most sense I think but I have never bought a used car before so pretty nervous about it. 


What would you look for?
Is there any red flags? 

The car is based in Cheshire, on 28,000 miles with full Genesis service history, no issues at all so far, still under warranty for 2y3m, recently MOTd without advisables. It‚Äôs petrol 2.5 liter turbo, 300hp

Thanks everyone in advance, for a detailed advise I‚Äôm more than happy to buy a coffee or two! Oh by the way I‚Äôm thinking of hiring an expert to have a look as well. ",1,1759067763.0,CarTalkUK,2,1.0,False

1nsoxwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nsoxwd/my_work_crush_situation_is_getting_out_of_hand/,My work crush situation is getting out of hand,"I (34M) moved to Europe last year. Here I am now living with my longtime girlfriend/fiance√© (32F), she moved here three months before me. Her company relocated her here and then I was hired by the same company (she passed my CV). So, we‚Äôre coworkers as well.

The first couple of months were hard, there was a lot of stress for both of us -more for her- since leaving your life and loved ones behind is not easy. Winter was a torture, we both were struggling with skin issues, dandruff, hair loss and all that shit. But things seem to be better now.

The first months, I was kind of bored at work, had nothing to do, time passed slowly and I started looking at people pass by since my desk is close to the break room / bathroom entrance, and adding it to my curiosity and humble admiration of female beauty, I started given side looks and checking on some girls but there‚Äôs this girl (AKA the crush) who I find really pretty. I think she‚Äôs a few years younger and is also an expat from another country . I was probably not subtle (my bad) and she started to notice that, a few  months passed and things escalated, her  and her girlfriends started looking at me, and during a social event at work she gave me this look which seemed like making fun of me but also kind of inviting me to do something (I have no clue). I must say that I am not interested in her in a romantic or even sexual way, it‚Äôs hard to describe it. Also, I don‚Äôt want to loose what I‚Äôve built together with ny girlfriend, she‚Äôs my best friend and lover, she supports me. Anyway, after all those episodes I am now trying not to look at her, just focusing on my work, my phone, music or whatever. Sometimes is hard because she has a routine of having coffee with her friends and is always there at the same time. If I go to the bathroom or break room, it‚Äôs unavoidable to fin her there.

I think I stupidly confused the girl‚Äôs interest in me with something else. It might as well be disgust or fear, I don‚Äôt know, sometimes I get looks from girls but not sure what it means. So I started creating stories and wondering in my head to the point I‚Äôm kind of obsessed. It‚Äôs affecting my sleep, I keep thinking about work all times, hoping to be there and run into her or see her by accident.

I just want this feeling of ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù or obsession to go away, just stop thinking about it and continue my life, enjoy the plans we have with my girlfriend and be happy together.  Not seeing the girl helps a lot, the problem is I have to go to the office at least 4 days a week and working from home doesn‚Äôt work for me.

Recently, We had another social event at work and I all the progress I‚Äôve made was erased, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm lucky or unlucky but I keep running into her or seeing her where I am even when I don‚Äôt want to. Coctel activity at the event? She was two tables from me. Dancing? Her group just next to mine, her just a couple of meters away. Chatting with friends? Again her group close. We have a couple of work friends in common but our groups are different. I am honestly sorry for her, she must be feeling I am some creepy dude from a Netflix show.

We‚Äôve crossed some words in the elevator, or next to the coffee machine, but nothing else. I‚Äôm very shy in this kind of situations and wouldn‚Äôt know how to come forward, but I‚Äôve been thinking of chatting with her and say sorry If I‚Äôve ever made her uncomfortable, maybe explaining what‚Äôs going on and give it a closure. I‚Äôm not sure if that would help or make things worse.",2,1759067699.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.75,False

1nsoxph,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nsoxph/should_you_try_the_best_appliance_slider_lopnur/,Should You Try the Best Appliance Slider LOPNUR for Easy Kitchen Use,"Using the LOPNUR Appliance Sliders, model LOPNUR, in my kitchen has been a bit of a game changer for me in ways I didn't quite expect. As someone who constantly juggles getting stuff done in the kitchen while keeping things neat and organized, I didn‚Äôt know how much I needed this sleek and practical little gadget. Testing it daily under varying conditions really made me appreciate its utility while also uncovering a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sliders are compact and lightweight, but they don‚Äôt compromise on durability. Made with heat-resistant and slip-proof material, they‚Äôve got an understated gray color that blends seamlessly into most kitchen aesthetics. Measuring just over 13.8 inches in depth, it accommodates a wide range of appliances, from my trusty coffee maker to the occasional use of a hefty stand mixer. The 360-degree rotation feature feels like a small stroke of genius‚Äîturning, sliding, and repositioning are incredibly smooth. This way, I can clean underneath or move things to another corner of the counter without fuss. Small details like the cuttable material, which allows customization to fit unique appliance footprints, show real thought went into the product‚Äôs design.

**Ease of Use**  
Setting these up was embarrassingly easy. There‚Äôs no learning curve to these sliders‚Äîit‚Äôs a simple yet practical concept that's executed well. I tried it with several appliances: an air fryer, a microwave, and my admittedly stubborn blender. The sliders made moving all of them easy from Day 1. The bonus? No scratches or scuff marks left behind on either my wooden or marble countertop surfaces. That alone felt like a win.  

**Check LOPNUR LOPNUR price on Amazon.**

**Strengths**  
The positives of this product truly stand out during daily use in the kitchen. Highlights I appreciated include:  
- The heat-resistant design, making this perfect for appliances that get warm during use.  
- Its lightweight material that doesn‚Äôt add unnecessary bulk but still supports heavy devices.  
- 360-degree motion, which meant no more awkward maneuvering of appliances on countertops.  
- DIY customization, allowing you to cut it for a snug fit under smaller appliances.  

The convenience factor is unmatched. Sliding out the coffee machine each morning or pulling forward my bread maker mid-afternoon is now an entirely one-handed activity. Even my partner, who‚Äôs famous for moving appliances like a demolition crew, managed to use the sliders without a single complaint.

**Limitations**  
Not everything about the product is perfect, though. Despite its many merits, I did run into a few areas for improvement that are worth noting:  
- The non-slip material works well overall but tends to shift slightly under lighter appliances like my toaster.  
- Though advertised as ‚Äúeasy to clean,‚Äù I found that dust and grains from the countertop tend to cling to the surface of the mat, requiring more frequent cleaning than I‚Äôd like.  
- If you aren‚Äôt precise with the customization cut, the edges can fray a little over time, leading me to trim it again.  

For most heavy-duty purposes, none of these quirks were deal-breakers, but they‚Äôre definitely factors to keep in mind, especially if you plan to use it solely on lighter devices.

**Product Contenders**  
I compared these sliders to other countertop accessories designed for appliance movement but found they had their fair share of limitations. Traditional appliance mats often didn‚Äôt have the 360-degree range these sliders offer, nor were they cut-to-size, leaving excess material awkwardly sticking out. Competing products frequently lacked the heat resistance, making them incompatible with hot appliances like coffee machines or toaster ovens. While other options tend to slide only forward and back, these sliders‚Äô smooth rotational movement felt far superior, especially for positioning items in tight spaces. On the flip side, a few competitors offered easier cleaning surfaces, which felt like an area where these could improve slightly.

**Quality for Price**  
Assessing this product‚Äôs value ultimately comes down to how you plan to use it. For the wide range of appliances, heat-resistant design, and versatility it offers, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth the investment‚Äîespecially for those with cluttered kitchens or those who use heavy appliances regularly. Compared to higher-end alternatives that provide fewer features for a higher price, these sliders deliver excellent functionality without burning a hole in your wallet. Budget-conscious folks looking for something useful but priced within reason will likely gravitate toward these.

1nsox8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/martianmanhunter/comments/1nsox8r/meaning_of_the_life/,meaning of the life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1759067650.0,martianmanhunter,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm relatively new in town and interested in forming a Mothership RPG gaming group. Partly because the game looks like a hell of a good time, and partly because I‚Äôd like to get to know some neat folks as a newcomer to town. 

Mothership is a Sci-fi Horror Tabletop Role Playing Game (a TTRPG, like D&D) set in the grimy future where horrifying things exist and bad things happen to normal people. 

Think Alien, Event Horizon, or Blade Runner where half the fun is watching the tension build as the characters fail and the situation gets progressively worse. It‚Äôs easy to learn, easy to play, and should make for some entertaining evenings. 

Short bit about me: early 30-something software professional who likes spending his weekends outside. Best recent read: [Devils by Joe Abercrombie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233800039-the-devils). Best recent walk: wandering through Sangamon River Forest Preserve to get my [Champaign Trail Challenge](https://www.champaignforests.org/Get-Involved/Ways-to-Support/Trail-Challenge) selfies. 

Who you might be: a kind friendly nerdy person who likes science fiction, enjoys collaborative storytelling, and can spare an evening every two-ish weeks. No pre-existing skills/knowledge required. Mothership can touch on some more mature themes (EG: death, stress, sanity, failure, grotesque abominations) so you should be comfortable discussing those topics in a safe group setting. 

If interested, feel free to shoot me a DM or comment below. We can then grab a coffee and see if we‚Äôre a good fit. I‚Äôd like to start mid-October-ish.

I've gone to lesbian bars where lesbian porn is played on screen, seen lesbian drag shows where there is a great emphasis on sex,and he'll, every time I see a post on this forum it's usually about the subjects face being squished between a fellow lesbians thighs.

JUST TO BE CLEAR- this isn't a bad thing, and I am not shaming the hypersexualisation that other Lesbian women have, but I find that I do not want to be squashed within anyone's thighs until I at least know the person first, had coffee with them, seen them when they let their guard down, etc. Like, I can see the most gorgeous woman at a lesbian strip show and absolutely feel nothing because 'I don't know her... why would I feel any attraction?' Like, I have never had a celebrity crush in my life due to this.

But then in another scenario if a woman is kind to me and goes out of their way to do something of that essence for me, it's like a light switch is turned on, a spotlight placed upon said woman, and I think 'Wow, she is absolutely gorgeous.'

Does anyone else in the community feel this way? I also feel disconnected in the queer community due to this. I don't want to instantly fuck someone as soon as I lay eyes on them, I want to get to know them, then start pebbling gifts to them before fully romancing them.

1nsoog9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1nsoog9/explore_the_best_espresso_machine_for_home/,Explore the Best Espresso Machine for Home Kismile Review Worth It,"Sipping a perfect cup of coffee every morning transforms my day, so testing the Kismile Espresso Machine with Grinder felt like welcoming a new companion to my home brewing ritual. Its sleek stainless steel design screamed sophistication and professionalism right out of the box, blending seamlessly with my kitchen decor. The first sip, though, is what truly convinced me this espresso maker deserves a review. Let me take you through my experience with this machine, outlining its strengths, weaknesses, and whether it's worth your time.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This espresso machine has an undeniably premium feel. The stainless steel exterior not only adds durability but also a modern aesthetic. Its dimensions work well for compact kitchen spaces, as I found it tucked comfortably between my toaster and blender without being intrusive. The 2.8-liter removable water tank proved surprisingly practical. Filling, cleaning, and reattaching it feels effortless, and it‚Äôs large enough that frequent use doesn‚Äôt require constant refilling. However, weighing in at 20.5 pounds, the machine isn't exactly portable. That's not a major issue for me, since it found a permanent home on my counter, but others might find the heft a bit much if they move it often.  

**Performance: Espresso Like a Pro**  
One of the first things I noticed was the 20-bar Italian pump‚Äîa feature typically reserved for high-end models. It delivers robust pressure, extracting deep, rich flavors from the coffee grounds. Pair this with the PID intelligent temperature control that keeps heat within a tight 30¬∞F range, and you get a cup of espresso that‚Äôs consistently top-notch. I experimented with single and double shots, both brewed perfectly using the built-in buttons. The machine makes a soft hum while brewing, quieter than others I‚Äôve used, which I appreciated during early mornings when quiet is golden.  

[Grab Kismile Espresso Machine with Grinder at the best price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b0dfyj2mx5/)  

**Barista-Ready Milk Frother**  
The milk frother impressed me with its ability to create barista-level creamy foam. It‚Äôs ideal for lattes or cappuccinos, and as someone who enjoys the occasional macchiato, it hit all the right notes. Switching the steam wand to a hot water dispenser felt intuitive, and it doubled as a tool to clean the wand thoroughly after every use. I let my less-coffee-obsessed friend give it a whirl; with zero prior experience, they had frothed milk ready for a latte in under two minutes. The learning curve here? Practically non-existent.  

**Built-in Grinder: Precision Control**  
Having a grinder combined with the espresso maker was a game-changer. The precision conical burr grinder offers 30 adjustable grind settings, which felt a bit overwhelming at first. After some trial and error, though, I learned precision leads to incredible customization. I found the finer grind setting essential for pulling richer espresso shots. On a busier day, I even toyed with a medium grind to brew a caf√©-style Americano that tasted better than I ever expected from a home machine.  

**Positives**  
‚Ä¢ Reliable 20-bar pump for excellent extraction  
‚Ä¢ Built-in conical burr grinder with customizable settings  
‚Ä¢ Easy-to-use milk frother creates velvety foam  
‚Ä¢ Durable stainless steel build, perfect for modern kitchens  

**Negatives**  
‚Ä¢ The grinder settings might intimidate beginners initially  
‚Ä¢ A bit heavy, making it less ideal for portable use  
‚Ä¢ Limited number of included accessories compared to competitors  

**Alternative Products**  
While testing this machine, I couldn‚Äôt resist comparing it to other popular espresso makers. Models like the Breville Barista Express deliver similar grind-and-brew systems, though they come with a heftier price tag. Breville's machine might have a slight edge in grinder precision, but I found the Kismile excelled in frothing and milk customization. Nespresso followed as another contender, boasting convenience and portability, yet it relies on pods, which lack the freshness and control I enjoyed with this grinder-equipped system. The Kismile falls somewhere in a sweet middle ground‚Äîoffering premium coffee quality at home without breaking the bank.  

**True Value**  
When evaluating its price against its features, this espresso machine offers incredible value for a semi-automatic option. The grinder itself‚Äîseparate from the brewing system‚Äîwould be a significant investment if bought on its own. Combine that with the machine's steaming capabilities and caf√©-quality results, and it‚Äôs hard to fault what you‚Äôre getting for the cost. That said, if you‚Äôre looking for portability or you‚Äôre a complete novice, consider simpler models to start your coffee journey.

1nsonys,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1nsonys/dealing_with_the_constant_negativity/,Dealing with the constant negativity,"I'm 61 and I've had a number of ups and downs in my life, who hasn't. As a result I can be a pretty anxious person at times, I battle a lot with catastrophic thoughts. Always worried about what will happen next. I worry about my adult children, my sister, my extended family. I'm always pushing back those worries. So I work very hard at maintaining optimism and thinking of the best outcome, not the worst, etc.  I'm very much a ""how can I make this work"" person.

I have lived with my 86 year old elderly mother since my father passed away two years ago. And at first, of course, I was prepared for the fact that she was grieving and adjusting to life without her husband of over 60 years. But now what I'm seeing is that she's a perpetually negative woman who almost thrives in drama and negativity.  

Every morning, without fail, she wakes up and if I'm in the living room having a coffee, she will walk in and immediately launch into her litany of issues. Just a sample of the last few weeks: 

\- ""I couldn't sleep at all last night, I was up for hours."" 

\- ""I'm so constipated, nothing is working."" and proceeds to describe in detail issues with bowel movements and what she's tried etc. 

\- ""My foot hurts; I have a corn on my toe."" - and launches into what she's doing to deal with the corn. 

\- ""My shoulder is in so much pain, I don't understand why"" - she has rheumatoid arthritis and inflammation and pain is part of her daily life.  

The routine is to say good morning, look out the window, complain about the weather, list several health complaints, talk about what she read happening in the news as she was lying in bed (always bad btw) and start listing all the things she wants me to do around the house or garden. 

I admit to often going to another part of the house as soon as I hear her get up so I don't have to hear the good morning litany of complaints. 

It's depressing and exhausting. I've tried being more positive in the morning but doesn't work.

1nsojxs,https://i.redd.it/qawh3255lwrf1.jpeg,Update to Idea - Coffee Potion,"The idea is simple. This potion will allow you to **use all of your heroes when they are upgrading**. So you don't have to attack handicapped in clan wars or in the new Ranked Battles to come.

  
Why should this exist?

As there are 100s of levels and multiple heroes, you can't just be upgrading 1 or 2 at a time, so even if I buy the book of heroes every week, I still cannot do CWs and CWLs freely, which you know, is literally playing the game.

  
But won't players stop buying the Book of Heroes?

1. Yes, I suppose so. Hence we make this potion cost a lot of gems say from a 100 to 200 gems for 1 potion so it could be better to just but the book. 

2. Or get 1 potion in the raid shop for like 300 to 500 RM that way you'll only purchase like 1 (considering you could buy the lab potion and ores).

3. Or you get one at the end of the season track 1 for f2p and 2 to 3 for p2p.

4. You could get 3 to 5 of them in the Clan Games.

4. And you could get them in chests and buy them in the in-game and Supercell store.

  
Scenario Analysis;

1. F2p - You can get this every weekend with RM, you are not going to buy them for gems or money so that's out of the equation.

You will get 1 or 2 per month in the silver track and 3 to 5 in the Clan Games for the next month's CWL.

So at least you can do anywhere from 30 to 60 % of your CWs and CWLs with heroes even under them upgrading (depend9ing on how active your clan is).

  
2. P2p - You can get the same as the F2p but also from the shop, from the trader gem shop etc and the Gold Pass, so you don't have to worry about not having your heroes when doing CWLs or CWs or just in general.

  
Now I want to say - the specific numbers and how and how much of these you earn is debatable. But it is important for a system like this to further enhance the gaming experience. Even as a pay to win, you still cannot stress free upgrade your heroes and it's been 10+ years the game has existed and it's way past time something like this should have existed but it's never too late to add it.",8,1759066673.0,ClashOfClans,4,0.64,False

I don‚Äôt look up from arranging my reports, but I can feel her predatory smile from across the conference room. The others are already circling her like moths to a flame, all giggles and breathless compliments.

‚ÄúTarget,‚Äù I say, sliding the Q4 flash drive between my fingers. ‚ÄúClearance rack.‚Äù

The lie rolls off my tongue effortlessly. The blouse cost more than most people‚Äôs rent, but Brittany doesn‚Äôt need to know that Isabella Asher shops anywhere besides discount retailers. The woman who calls herself Isabella Asher, anyway.

‚ÄúOh, how practical of you.‚Äù Brittany‚Äôs laugh tinkles like breaking crystal. ‚ÄúI just adore how you make budget fashion look so‚Ä¶ adequate.‚Äù

I finally glance up, catch her wide blue eyes sparkling with malice. ‚ÄúThanks. I aim for adequacy in all things.‚Äù

Sarah from Marketing giggles. ‚ÄúIsabella, you‚Äôre so funny. I wish I had your confidence.‚Äù

If only you knew, I think, but I just smile. The kind of smile that says absolutely nothing while revealing everything about how little I think of this entire exchange.

The conference room door opens with its familiar pneumatic hiss, and Adrian Marlowe strides in like he owns the place. Which, technically, he does. No pleasantries, no wasted motion‚Äîjust pure, efficient authority in an expensive suit.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin.‚Äù

Two words. That‚Äôs all he ever needs to command absolute silence.

I slot the flash drive into my laptop, fingers steady as I navigate to the presentation folder. Around the table, everyone settles into their performance of Professional Competence. Brittany‚Äôs still smiling that razor-blade smile.

The projector hums to life. I click to the first slide, and my blood turns to ice.

It‚Äôs me. Naked. In my apartment. A photo I definitely never took, definitely never shared, and definitely never intended for the wall-sized screen of Marlowe Enterprises‚Äô main conference room.

The silence that follows isn‚Äôt just quiet‚Äîit‚Äôs the kind of vacuum that happens right before explosions. I can feel twelve pairs of eyes burning holes through my skin, can practically hear the collective intake of breath.

But here‚Äôs the thing about growing up with a father who could buy and sell small countries: you learn to keep your face blank when the world implodes.

My pulse spikes to hummingbird levels, but my hands don‚Äôt shake. I turn slowly to find Brittany‚Äôs eyes across the polished mahogany table. They‚Äôre wide with fake surprise, absolutely glittering with satisfaction.

And suddenly last night‚Äôs random ‚Äúpassword reset‚Äù email makes perfect sense. The one I ignored because I was running on four hours of sleep and three cups of coffee.

‚ÄúCheck the next slides,‚Äù Adrian says, his voice cutting through the tension like a scalpel. Bored. Almost irritated. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre clean, proceed.‚Äù

I delete the image without ceremony, scrolling through the rest of the presentation. Q4 projections, market analysis, action items‚Äîeverything else intact and professional. Of course. Brittany‚Äôs too smart to sabotage the actual work. Just my dignity.

Before I can open my mouth to address the elephant that just stripped naked in the room, my phone buzzes against the table. Mr. Wilson. Dad‚Äôs assistant.

‚ÄúBrittany,‚Äù I say, voice steady as bedrock, ‚Äúyou can take it from here.‚Äù

Her victory smile could power a small city.

I step into the hallway, already knowing this call will destroy what‚Äôs left of my carefully constructed day. ‚ÄúWilson?‚Äù

‚ÄúMiss Thorne, I‚Äôm sorry, there have been complications.‚Äù

My stomach drops through the floor. ‚ÄúWhat kind of complications?‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter the surgery. Your father has had a heart attack. The car is waiting downstairs.‚Äù

The hallway tilts slightly. I close my eyes, count to three, open them. Still standing. Still breathing. Still Isabella fucking Asher, who handles crisis like other people handle paperwork.

I push back into the conference room, where Brittany‚Äôs voice is already dripping professionalism all over my charts. Adrian glances up, that perpetually neutral expression giving nothing away.

‚ÄúMr. Marlowe. A word.‚Äù

He follows me out, closing the door behind him with deliberate precision.

‚ÄúIs this about the photo?‚Äù He sounds bored rather than curious, like discussing revenge porn is just another Tuesday agenda item.

I almost laughed. Almost. ‚ÄúIf I were the kind of woman who fell apart over a body, I wouldn‚Äôt be the one holding your Q4 together. Some of our colleagues struggle to assemble a spreadsheet without step-by-step instructions. I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

He blinks once. Slow. Calculating. ‚ÄúThen what?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy father just had a heart attack.‚Äù

The hallway seems to cinch tight. Adrian‚Äôs expression flickers‚Äîconfusion‚Äîbut I don't wait. I‚Äôm already moving, already three steps toward the elevator, when I hear him call my name.

But I don‚Äôt stop, don‚Äôt turn around, because there‚Äôs a town car from Dad‚Äôs fleet idling at the curb and if anyone from Finance is on a coffee run right now, Isabella Asher‚Äôs carefully maintained cover is about to go up in very expensive smoke.

The driver opens the door without a word. I slide into leather seats that squeak like money, jaw set like concrete, palms still cool from the conference room‚Äôs sterile air conditioning.

Behind me, Marlowe Enterprises hums on, blissfully unaware that the woman they call invisible has just stepped completely off their grid.",1,1759066566.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False
1nsohxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nsohxa/complete_set_up_advice_3500us/,Complete set up advice [$3500US],"I'm looking for my first set up and have been doing some research but I'd love some advice from the community. Budget of $3500 all in but I'm fine spending more time saving up if necessary.

The machine will be my daily driver, minimum 2 shots a day likely doubles (or 4 back to back). My wife's will be a milk based each time, mine majority black sometimes milk. Weekends probably making morning and mid day drinks for my wife and I. 

I'm willing to learn and have some extra control over my shot my wife will want workflow to be as simple as possible.

Top machine priorites: PID, no hot water/coffee coming into contact with plastic, boiler over HX to avoid a ""cooling flush"", buy it for life (I'd rather put money in now and not upgrade later). 

My nice to haves: stainless steel boiler, e61 group head, On/off timer but I'm also okay just plugging it into a smart outlet

We only use oat milk and I've read plant based milks can be pretty finicky with heat so I'm okay with something like the breville milk cafe instead of steaming from my espresso machine. (Don't see myself ever getting into latte art).

My top picks so far:

ECM Puristika 
Profitec Ride - I know probably overkill for my needs but it's gorgeous 

Others that I think would make my wife enjoy the experience more but I'm concerned about longevity due to more components and prefer no plastic tubing:

Meraki Espresso Machine
Fellow espresso series 1 

I haven't begun my grinder research yet so open to any advice but prefer electric. 

Any and all advice is appreciated, I'm very new to this so please let me know if I left out anything important or am focusing too much on some features and not enough on others. 

TL;DR - full new set up for around $3500, prefer quality now no need to upgrade later and as close to buy for life as it gets.",1,1759066517.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1nsohfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/1nsohfi/experience_what_i_did_with_my_first_flareup/,Experience: what I did with my first flare-up,"Hello!¬†

I wanted to share a bit of my psoriasis journey in case anyone finds this helpful. This is not advice, but me sharing my experience with my first ever flare up in my life. Please do you research and consult with your doctor, as I did.¬†

Context:

* My family has a strong history of psoriasis going back generations
* I am a 39-year old man from the tropics
* Up until August of 2025, I‚Äôve only had small patches usually behind my ear and on my elbows and knees
* I am fairly overweight and have been my the majority of my thirties. Wear a 36-38 waist pant
* I am lightly active and out everyday usually walking
* Have not had to be strict with my diet until recently (so, ate grains, gluten, dairy, drank alcohol, and so on daily)
* Drink alcohol regularly (heavily in August as there was a lot of celebrations)
* Life has been stressful for the last ten months (loss of a family member, moving, and burnout working 90 hours per week)

The Flare up:

* Happened in mid-August 2025 and it was the first time it had ever happened in my life. It spread rapidly and turned my entire trunk purple-ish, raised and scaley lesions, etc. ¬†
* It was all over my trunk, extremities (elbows and knees), groin, glutes, back, and scalp.
* Roughly about 70% was covered with what looked like a combination of plaque and guttate psoriasis. Doctor only confirm plaque.
* Tried the typical steroid creams and such for a few weeks, but only it got worse. 

What changed:¬†

* I am lucky enough to be on a long break before my next work assignment, so I went to the tropics to get more sunlight and bathe in the ocean. I live in a place that's really cold
* Stopped alcohol 10th September
* On September 19, I began the below after tons of research and medical counsel:
* DIET:
   * Started a week-long water fast with two aims: 1. Reset my gut microbiome, and 2. Jump start my weight loss journey. Note: I only drank water to completely remove everything from my system (no teas or black coffee)
   * Continued to abstain from alcohol
* PHYSICAL:
   * Began walking a minimum of 20k steps daily to get the proper UVB rays (between 10-1600). Once in the mid morning between 10-12 and another between 15-17.
   * Got at least 8 hours of sleep daily WHERE I COULD GET IT. This means that I sometimes had to nap in the afternoons.
* HYGIENE
   * Discontinued my deodorant, cologne, hair products, etc. Note: I will pick it up after all is healed. This is just to control what goes on my skin.
   * I used head and shoulders on my scalp, a gentle foam wash for my face, and an all-natural soap with ylang ylang, chamomile, and lavender for their calming properties. Sometimes I showered twice, especially to get the sweat off.¬†
   * In the mornings before my walk, I put lavender oil in my hair with a bandana. Lavender is calming. My skins was a combination of the steroid creams and lavender Aveeno.
   * In the evening, after bathing, I combined steroid creams, coconut oil, and lavender Aveeno. I put coconut oil in my hair with a bandana overnight (I did this every other night).
* MENTAL:
   * I don‚Äôt meditate (as I don‚Äôt have the patience), but I did a bit more writing and recorded when I didn‚Äôt feel like writing. This made my stress levels go down.
   * Spoke with a friend or family everyday to keep my mind going (especially during the fast)
* Once I broke the fast, I removed grains, gluten, sugar additives, alcohol, and dairy. Note: I will add them one by one as I continue to test what works for me.
* Currently, I‚Äôve adopted an intermittent fasting schedule as it continues to heal.¬†

The results:

* Within nine days, my psoriasis has remarkedly reduced from 70% to \~35%. I no longer have raised and scaley lesions, the color has changed from purple-ish to light brown and pink (I have dark skin), and there‚Äôs signs that smoother skin is resurfacing.¬†
* In a lot of areas, mostly on my shoulders, upper back, and stomach, they are completely healed.
* For a good portion of my adult life I have always had a black neck (acanthosis nigricans). That is clearing up and is very smooth.
* Waist size is down by three inches (mostly water weight) and my clothes, that fit well, are baggy. Note: I typically wear a size 36-38 and L-XL¬†
* My face skin is brighter and glowing.
* Energy levels are medium to high. 

Things to consider:

* I started off doing a three day then checked in with my body to see if I can got further. Then decide that since I did three, I can do five. Ultimately, I did seven days (19-26 October) before breaking my fast.  I found starting this way was beneficial for me.
* Be care when you break your fast. I kept things safe with an egg and broth, and it worked well. 
* Being outside for walks with my lesions visible and scalp was terrifying! However, I had to put my vanity aside for my overall, long-term health. I found that listening to music or talking with a friend was a good way to distract my terror and embarrassment. 
* When looking for products, I opted for more natural with calming and anti-inflammatory properties. E.g., chamomile, lavender, ylang ylang, lemon grass, turmeric, coconut, etc. 
* The fast was hard, but helps to get outside even if it's just a walk around the block. 

I know that‚Äôs a lot, but it‚Äôs helped me tons! Again, please do your research and consult your doctor where you can. Body types and chemistry do differ. So, you want to do this safely and reduce the risk of exacerbating the condition. Good luck and happy healing!¬†",2,1759066478.0,Psoriasis,1,1.0,False

Hey fellow hustlers! üôå

So, let‚Äôs chat about something that‚Äôs been on my mind lately. You know that side hustle you‚Äôre pouring your heart and soul into? The one that keeps you up at night, stressing about the next move while you sip what might be your thirteenth cup of coffee? ‚òï What if I told you that you could actually turn that labor of love into a *passive income stream* using AI? Yup, that's right! 

**Why Now?**  
Guys, the landscape of content creation is shifting faster than my attention span when I try to read the fine print in my contracts (and we all know how bad that is!). If you're not exploring ways to *automate and monetize* your side hustle, you might just be left out in the cold‚Ä¶ and we don‚Äôt want that, do we? ‚ùÑÔ∏è

**Here‚Äôs a quick guide on how to get started:**

1. **Identify Your Niche:**  
   What do you love? What are you good at? ü§î If you're already creating content‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs blogs, videos, or music‚Äîleveraging AI tools within your niche can help you scale without the burnout.

2. **Automate Content Creation:**  
   Use AI tools like ChatGPT (hey, that‚Äôs us!) or Jasper, to help draft posts, brainstorm ideas, or even create entire scripts. Imagine not having to write every single word yourself! It‚Äôs like having a super-smart intern who never takes coffee breaks.

3. **Schedule & Optimize:**  
   With platforms like Buffer and Hootsuite, you can schedule your posts ahead of time. This has saved me so many late-night panics! Set it and forget it, while your content continues to work for you.

4. **Monetize Smartly:**  
   Affiliate marketing, merch, online courses‚Äîthere are SO many ways to make money off your content. The beauty of AI is in its ability to help analyze what‚Äôs working for you. ü§© Use those analytics tools to see where you should focus your efforts. 

5. **Engage with Your Audience:**  
   Remember, you still need to be the friendly face behind the username! Let AI handle the repetitive tasks while you charm your audience with some genuine interaction. After all, who wouldn‚Äôt want to hear from the real you? üçÄ

**A quick personal story:**  
When I first started my side hustle, I was drowning in content creation. I was manually drafting everything, and it sucked up all my time. But once I started to lean on AI tools, my evenings freed up, and I could actually binge-watch that new Netflix series everyone was talking about! üòé

Now, imagine what freedom feels like when you‚Äôre no longer chained to your desk. How great would it be to wake up, check your phone, and see those delightful little notifications of sales rolling in while you‚Äôre enjoying some pancake art? ü•û 

So, let‚Äôs face it‚Äî*the future is now.* If you‚Äôre not automating and monetizing, are you even in the side hustle game?

I‚Äôm curious to hear if anyone has tried any of these strategies or perhaps has other tips to share! Let‚Äôs figure this out together. üí™",1,1759066472.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1nsogqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nsogqv/i_am_so_happy_my_husband_did_this/,I am so happy my husband did this...,"My husband and I both (Both 50 somethings) work in HiTech. I work from home all the time unless I have to travel or go into the office for an odd meeting. This means occasionally one or the other of us having to travel for work. Now you need to understand that we had a lot of issues with sex for a very long time. We went to sex therapy and got things going in the right direction, so sex is very important for us. Traveling for work obviously means no sex, and I genuinely miss having sex with him even for a few days. 

I also suffer from depression and anxiety and have medication for those. This is part of the reason that sex is so important. The medication kills my sex drive, so I need to work at it to keep it up. I don't ever want to go back to what we had, or didn't have, before we got help.

Anyway Last week he was away for the whole week. He left Sunday morning to head to the San Fran Bay Area, and was there all week. I hate when he takes overnight flights because it wipes him out and I feel so bad for him, so I always tell him to stay the extra day and come back the next day so he can get as good of a nights sleep as he can. So he was going to come back Saturday. Given time differences and lay over he would be traveling all day, so I wouldn't see him till nearly midnight.

Anyway, last week I was feeling particularly needy. I really missed him so much. We would call each night. We had a couple of dirty video calls to help ease the pressure. But I really missed him. I was quite sad, though I was careful not to let him know. I was starting to get breakthrough anxiety as well over every sound the house was making. 

Friday was horrible. I had a light day at work so nothing to distract me there. I tried all my usually tricks to help distract me from anxiety. I went to the gym. I did an extra workout on the treadmill. Tried to have coffee with one of my girlfriends but she was busy. I tried thinking of positive things.  My last resort when my husband isn't hear for anxiety ends up being sucking my thumb and that didn't work. (Don't judge me I am very orally fixated and it beats smoking which I gave up about 25 years ago.) Literally nothing was working. I even tried masturbating but even that got interrupted by the endless cycle in my head when I heard a car door slam next door. (I can laugh about it now because it's passed, but I am mid 50s, mom bod, completely naked, running around the house, peeking out thought the curtains trying to see what's going on.) It got even worse because as a way to try and distract myself I sent my husband some dirty pictures, and then when I tried to call him he made an excuse about his phone dying and his charger being lost. 

Anyway, Saturday morning I woke up to him coming home. Without telling me, he had changed his flight home. He left for the airport right after his last meeting, caught the first flight out of San Fran. Middle seats the entire flight with three layovers. As soon as I saw him I started crying. I was so happy that he was home. I just got him undressed and in bed, wrapped myself around him and broke down crying uncontrollably for about 10 minutes. I don't know how, but he just knew that I needed him. I was trying so hard to keep it together and be strong... but in the end I just melted when I saw him.

I love so much that he just somehow knew that I needed him, and what he put himself through to get home to me early. He slept a lot yesterday because he was exhausted, but I was just so glad to have him back. I actually spent time sitting on the bed watching him sleep... Yeh I know... it's weird... but when you have gone through what I went thought last week in my own head... sometimes weird is ok... LOL

I just have to say, as I am sitting here typing this, looking over at him, I am the luckiest girl in the world right now. ",14,1759066421.0,Marriage,4,1.0,False

From March 2012  review of the OG in Grand Forks, ND:

After a lengthy wait for Olive Garden to open in Grand Forks, the lines were long in February. The novelty is slowly wearing off, but the steady following attests the warm welcome.

My first visit to Olive Garden was during midafternoon, so I could be sure to get in. After a late breakfast, I figured a late lunch would be fashionable.

The place is impressive. It's fashioned in Tuscan farmhouse style with a welcoming entryway. There is seating for those who are waiting.

My booth was near the kitchen, and I watched the waiters in white shirts, ties, black trousers and aprons adorned with gold-colored towels. They were busy at midday, punching in orders and carrying out bread and pasta.

It had been a few years since I ate at the older Olive Garden in Fargo, so I studied the two manageable menus offering appetizers, soups and salads, grilled sandwiches, pizza, classic dishes, chicken and seafood and filled pastas.

At length, I asked my server what she would recommend. She suggested chicken Alfredo, and I went with that. Instead of the raspberry lemonade she suggested, I drank water.

She first brought me the familiar Olive Garden salad bowl with crisp greens, peppers, onion rings and yes -- several black olives. Along with it came a plate with two long, warm breadsticks.

The chicken Alfredo ($10.95) was warm and comforting on a cold day. The portion was generous. My server was ready with Parmesan cheese.

As I ate, I noticed the vases and planters with permanent flower displays on the ledges. There are several dining areas with arched doorways. And there is a fireplace that adds warmth to the decor.

Olive Garden has an attractive bar area to the right of the entryway. The restaurant has a full liquor license and a wine list offering a wide selection to complement Italian meals. Nonalcoholic beverages include coolers, specialty coffees and hot teas.

On a hot summer day, I will try the raspberry lemonade that was recommended.

There's a homemade soup, salad and breadstick lunch available until 4 p.m. daily for $6.95.

An olive branch on menu items signified low-fat entrees. There is a Garden Fare Nutrition Guide available for customers seeking gluten-free food. And for those with food allergies, Olive Garden has an Allergen Information Guide.

All in all, it is the largest and most beautiful restaurant now operating in Grand Forks. It attracts visitors from out of town as well as people who live here.

Olive Garden is part of the Darden chain of restaurants that also operates Red Lobster. There are about 700 restaurants, including four Olive Gardens in North Dakota's major cities.

Olive Garden has gained a following since 1982 with its ample portions and relaxed ambience. It's known for its classic lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken Parmigiana.",33,1759066348.0,raleigh,2,0.9,False

I‚Äôve had benign fasciculations for 8 years.

My history:
I had a period of depression/burnout with fear of imminent death from age 17 to 23. I‚Äôve been a hypochondriac since I was 17. My fasciculations started a few months after the birth of my second child, around age 27, during which I went through a traumatic event that put me into a state of complex PTSD. The anesthetist forced a medical procedure on me without consent while I was pushing. I was made to give birth in silence, without moving, in pain, so that the anesthesia needle wouldn‚Äôt cause lifelong injury. I was literally touching my baby‚Äôs head with my hands when he released me. I can‚Äôt say for sure that my BFS started at that exact moment, because it appeared a few months later, but that event triggered complex PTSD. Around the same time, I also had undiagnosed acid reflux that made me choke at night.

My symptoms:
For the first two years, symptoms kept increasing: irregular fasciculations all over, hundreds and hundreds of times per day, even vibrating in my ears and waking me up at night. In the following years, I also experienced fast, rhythmic internal tremors. I had an EMG and the results were normal. During that time, I was convinced I was going to die.

After more than 7 years of fasciculations, I haven‚Äôt had any fasciculations or tremors for months now. This seems to coincide with stopping caffeine (I drink tea instead). I suspect I‚Äôm intolerant to something in coffee.

Otherwise, my life is still stressful: I currently have two almost full-time jobs, a teenager and a neurodivergent child.

That‚Äôs it‚Ä¶

Seven years ago, I would have really appreciated reading a testimony like this. Especially when I was sure I had a serious disease and doctors couldn‚Äôt figure it out. Just to say that sometimes it gets worse, sometimes it gets better, right now it‚Äôs almost gone and more important, I am still alive and quite healthy.

Good luck to all of you.

1nsocn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nsocn8/original_horror_fiction_24_days_of_terror/,Original Horror Fiction: 24 Days of Terror,"I‚Äôve been writing my own original horror stories and wanted to share one with you. It‚Äôs called **‚Äú24 Days of Terror‚Äù** ‚Äî about a family who moves into a century-old New Orleans apartment building and slowly realises why the locals whisper about the rooftop after dark.

If you‚Äôre more into listening than reading, I‚Äôve recorded a narrated version on my small horror channel.  it‚Äôs just me reading my own work, no ads. You can listen here if you‚Äôd rather experience it that way: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OePSdjqBJT0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OePSdjqBJT0)

Feedback from fellow horror fans really helps me improve ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to hear what you think. Stay spooky!

You can read the full story below:

**24 Days of Terror.**

Daniel Harper was used to dark things. For twenty years as writer, he had written about murderers, stalkers, and unspeakable acts of violence. He thought horror belonged on the page, confined neatly between covers. When his latest novel became a bestseller, Daniel decided to move his family to a place that felt alive with stories.

That‚Äôs how he, his wife Claire, and their eight-year-old daughter Emily ended up in The Duval, a towering, century-old apartment building in New Orleans‚Äô Garden District.

From the street, the place looked almost regal, ivy crawling up brick walls, wrought-iron balconies, tall, shuttered windows. Locals whispered that The Duval was cursed, but to Daniel, that was just seasoning. He would use the atmosphere in his next book.

The building manager, a wiry man with skin the color of paper and watery eyes, had given only one stern warning when they signed the lease:

‚ÄúNo one goes on the rooftop after 11 PM. No exceptions.‚Äù

Claire had chuckled. ‚ÄúWhat happens? The boogeyman shows up?‚Äù

The manager had not smiled.

At first, The Duval seemed normal, even charming. The hallways smelled faintly of old wood and jasmine. Emily loved pressing the buttons in the antique service elevator, whose brass gates rattled when it closed. Their sixth-floor apartment had high ceilings, faded crown molding, and windows that looked out over the city like open eyes.

But Claire couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the roof. She had glimpsed it the first day, a wide terrace with a crumbling stone railing, offering an unbroken view of New Orleans. At night, the skyline shimmered with streetlamps and neon signs, and the river glowed like a black serpent beneath the moonlight.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the city belongs to the dead up there,‚Äù she told Daniel. ‚ÄúWe have to see it at night.‚Äù

Daniel was reluctant. He didn‚Äôt like breaking rules, especially ones given so firmly. But on a rainy Saturday evening, with jazz drifting up from the streets and Emily asleep in her room, Claire dragged him upstairs.

They stayed on the roof for a long time. Daniel kept wondering why the building had rules about not being up there after 11, there was no problem here It was a roof like any other building Anyway. they came back home, and life went on.

After a few days, it rained again. Claire wanted to see the city in the storm, so they went up. This time, they weren‚Äôt alone. A couple was already there, standing by the railing, enjoying the rain. They smiled, said hello. Told Daniel and Claire they lived on the fourth floor.

Everyone talked for a while. It felt normal, even nice. Daniel and Claire went back down eventually. The couple introduced themselves as Peter and Melissa. They seemed friendly.

That night, after dinner, they bathed and went to sleep. Daniel stayed up a little, typing on his machine.

Then the scream came.

Emily.

They ran into her room. She was sitting up in bed, crying.

Claire hugged Emily. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, honey. Why did you scream?‚Äù

Emily pointed at the door. Her voice shook.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone standing there.‚Äù

¬†she whispered. ‚ÄúHe was talking, but I couldn‚Äôt understand. His face was all cut up.‚Äù

Claire soothed her, insisting it was a dream. But Emily shook her head.

‚ÄúHe said‚Ä¶ he was going to your room.‚Äù

Claire laughed nervously, tucking her in. But when she and Daniel returned to their bedroom, they froze.

The bed wasn‚Äôt empty. In the dim light coming from the window, they saw the outline of someone sleeping on Daniel‚Äôs side, beneath the covers.

Daniel stopped Claire outside the room. He peered in first, switched on the light.

Nobody there. Just a faint smell of rot.

He let out a nervous laugh. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre also getting caught up in Emily‚Äôs imagination.‚Äù

Late that night, Daniel woke with a start. Something was crawling across his cheek. He brushed at it, thinking it was just a fly. But the feeling came again‚Äîthicker, slimier.

He reached up and felt them. Soft, writhing shapes sliding into tiny holes in his skin. Worms. Burrowing. He could feel them squirming inside his cheeks, his jaw.

He bolted from the bed, ran into the bathroom. His screams echoed through the apartment as he clawed at his face, yanking handfuls of the things out. They slapped wetly into the sink, twitching, pale. His skin burned with raw, open gaps where they had tunnelled.

He looked into the mirror..... And froze!!

His face was normal. No holes. No worms. Just his reflection staring back, wide-eyed, trembling.

The sink was empty.

From the bedroom, Claire‚Äôs voice: ‚ÄúDaniel? What happened?‚Äù

He gripped the porcelain so hard his knuckles whitened. He whispered to himself, ‚ÄúIt was real. I felt them. I know I felt them.‚Äù

But he didn‚Äôt answer her.

The next night, Emily screamed again. They rushed to her room. She wasn‚Äôt pointing at the door this time. She was staring at the other side of her bed‚Ä¶. Her tiny hand lifted, shaking, and she pointed.

Daniel‚Äôs stomach dropped.

There was someone lying there.

A man. Stretched out on his back, tucked under Emily‚Äôs blankets, head resting peacefully on her pillow.

Daniel‚Äôs blood ran cold when he saw the face.

It was his own‚Ä¶. His own body. His own face. Sleeping calmly beside his daughter.

Claire gasped and pulled Emily away.

Daniel lunged forward, fists clenched...!

But the bed was empty.

Pillow smooth. Covers untouched.

Emily sobbed into her mother‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúDaddy‚Ä¶ he was on my bed.‚Äù

No one slept after that. Lights stayed on in every room. Daniel sat at the kitchen table with coffee, typing random words on his typewriter just to keep himself awake.

At 3:07 a.m., the sound came. Knocking‚Ä¶. Sharp. Deliberate.

Not at the door. At the window.

The sixth-floor window. The Harper apartment was on the sixth floor.... impossible for anyone to reach from outside.

Daniel yanked open the curtains, only to find a bloody handprint smeared across the glass. The next morning, it was gone.

Another night, Emily woke shrieking again. Her voice was raw, high-pitched, a sound of pure animal terror.

This time she wasn‚Äôt pointing at the door.

She was pointing at the ceiling.

Daniel‚Äôs eyes followed her trembling finger‚Äîand his breath froze in his lungs.

Two faces dangled upside down above her bed, swaying slightly, like slabs of meat hung to bleed out. Their long black hair drifted toward the floor, dripping filth onto Emily‚Äôs blanket.

It was Peter and Melissa.

But not as they had been on the roof.

Their mouths had been torn wider than any human jaw should allow..... stretching ear to ear, teeth jagged, black, cracked like rotten wood. Their eyes dripped thick tar, leaving streaks on the ceiling as it pooled, fat drops plopping onto the floor. Their necks creaked as if only half attached.

They smiled.

Daniel grabbed Emily from the bed, clutching her so tightly she squealed, and bolted for the hallway. Claire followed, sobbing and muttering ‚Äúno, no, no, no.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt look back.

The Harpers weren‚Äôt the only ones.

Mrs. Beaumont, the frail widow on the third floor, had stopped Claire in the lobby days earlier. Her paper-thin hands had gripped Claire‚Äôs wrist with surprising strength.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here,‚Äù she whispered, her cloudy eyes darting toward the empty stairwell. ‚ÄúThe children. I saw them last night, playing outside my balcony.‚Äù

Claire forced a polite smile, thinking it was grief and age muddling her mind. But Mrs. Beaumont leaned closer, her breath sour, voice cracking to a whisper.

‚ÄúThey had no eyes. Just holes. Holes that glowed. Don‚Äôt let your little one near them.‚Äù

A week later, Mrs. Beaumont‚Äôs body was found at the bottom of that same stairwell.

Her bones looked snapped, not broken from a fall, like someone had twisted her apart mid-air and tossed her down like a doll.

No one had seen her fall. No one had heard a thing.

Daniel tried to rationalize it. Stress. Hallucinations.

It had been a week since Mrs. Beaumont‚Äôs death, and nothing new had happened. The halls were quiet again, Emily had been sleeping through most nights, and for a fleeting moment, Daniel almost believed life inside the building was returning to normal.

But the calm never lasted long in that place.

One night, Daniel used the service lift. It stood apart from the newer, polished elevators‚Ä¶. Its brass gate was dented, control panel worn smooth by decades of use, and yet it always seemed alive.

The car jolted and began its descent. At first it was ordinary‚Äîpast the lobby, toward the basement. But then it kept going, further and further. Daniel jabbed the buttons, but nothing responded.

The light flickered, sputtered, then went out. Darkness swallowed him.

Something cold seeped around his shoes. Water. Rising fast, soaking his socks, creeping up his legs. He slammed his fists against the gate, but the lift only shuddered and sank deeper.

Then, from above, came a sound that froze him.

Emily‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

It echoed hollowly through the shaft, softer each time, stretching into something inhuman. The water was at his knees now, icy, heavy, dragging him down. He screamed until his throat tore.

And then everything went black.

Daniel woke gasping in his bed.

His sheets were damp with sweat. His fists throbbed, raw and bleeding. His shoes, tossed beside the mattress, were still wet.

He shot upright, clutching the blanket. ‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶ how did I get here?‚Äù His voice cracked. ‚ÄúWho brought me home? I was in the elevator‚ÄîClaire, I was.....I was!‚Äù

Claire turned from the dresser, eyes wide. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù She rushed to him, gripping his shoulders. ‚ÄúDaniel, you never left this room. You‚Äôve been sleeping here the whole night.‚Äù

He shook his head violently, teeth clenched. ‚ÄúNo. I was there. I heard Emily‚Äôs voice. The water... God, Claire, I felt it. How else..... how else are my shoes wet?‚Äù

For the first time, she didn‚Äôt argue. She just stared at his shoes in silence‚Ä¶. shoes didn‚Äôt even have a single drop of water on them, her lips trembling, as though she wanted to say something but couldn‚Äôt.

Daniel couldn‚Äôt stay inside after that. His hands still ached, his shoes still damp, and the memory of Emily‚Äôs hollow voice gnawed at him like teeth. At dawn, while Claire tried to settle Emily for school, he slipped on a jacket and headed downstairs. He told himself he needed cigarettes, but really, he just needed to breathe air that didn‚Äôt taste like rot.

The lobby was nearly empty. Outside, the sky was a bruised Gray, the streets wet from last night‚Äôs rain. Alvarez, the old security guard, was at his usual post near the door, sipping from a dented thermos.

As Daniel passed, Alvarez‚Äôs eyes flicked downward. His brow furrowed.

‚ÄúSe√±or,‚Äù he rasped, setting his thermos aside. ‚ÄúYour wrists.‚Äù

Daniel looked down. His skin was mottled, ringed in faint, red-purple grooves, perfect circles, as though something had gripped him hard with iron cuffs. He hadn‚Äôt noticed them before.

The guard‚Äôs face drained of colour. He muttered a prayer under his breath, then looked Daniel dead in the eye.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been to the old service lift, You have seen them, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Daniel froze mid-step. ‚ÄúWhat? No, I....!‚Äù

Alvarez shook his head sharply. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt waste breath lying. I know that no one believes you, but I can see it on you. That place leaves its mark.‚Äù

Daniel‚Äôs throat went dry. He tried to laugh it off, but the words broke loose in a hoarse whisper. ‚ÄúI was there. It‚Ä¶ it took me somewhere. I heard my daughter‚Äôs voice. I almost drowned.‚Äù

Alvarez closed his eyes and exhaled slowly, as though he had been waiting years for someone to confirm it. ‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs begun for you,‚Äù he said.

Daniel‚Äôs jaw tightened. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Alvarez‚Äôs eyes hardened as he looked at Daniel. ‚ÄúTwelve years ago, a couple named Peter and Melissa lived here in The Duval. To everyone else they seemed kind, polite, good neighbours. But behind their door, they were something else entirely.‚Äù

His voice dropped to a rasp. ‚ÄúThey lured young girls from this building. Kept them hidden. Abused them. And when they were done‚Ä¶‚Äù He hesitated, crossing himself. ‚ÄúThey ate them.‚Äù

Daniel‚Äôs breath caught.

‚ÄúNobody knew,‚Äù Alvarez continued, ‚Äúuntil one night a woman saw them dragging a girl into their apartment. By the time the residents broke down the door, the child was already dead. Once the parents learned the truth, the whole building turned on them.‚Äù

He jabbed a finger toward the far end of the lobby. ‚ÄúThey locked Peter and Melissa in the basement, inside that service lift shaft you stepped into. That was their prison. For twenty-four days, the neighbours beat them, starved them, carved pieces off them, the same way the parents had lost their children piece by piece.‚Äù

Daniel‚Äôs stomach churned, but Alvarez pressed on. ‚ÄúAnd on the twenty-fifth day, when the last of the missing girls‚Äô bodies was finally found.... they dragged Peter and Melissa up. 

First, they drowned them in the shaft until they were half-dead. Then they hauled them to the roof, smashed their skulls, ripped out their nails, and threw what was left over the railing. Their blood stained the courtyard bricks for weeks. It never really washed away.‚Äù

The guard‚Äôs hands shook as he lit a cigarette, his eyes never leaving Daniel‚Äôs. ‚ÄúThat elevator carried their screams. Their pain. Their Evil. The shaft is still soaked in it. And now‚Ä¶ it repeats. Anyone who sees Peter and Melissa after eleven at night is pulled into their cycle.

Alvarez‚Äôs eyes glinted with something between fear and pity. ‚ÄúNow anyone who goes on the roof and sees them‚Äîlives their torment. Twenty-four nights of it. And on the twenty-fifth‚Ä¶ they take one of your family for their hunger.‚Äù

Daniel‚Äôs stomach turned to ice. Claire had seen them. Emily too.

Daniel staggered back, clutching his wrist where the faint bruises still circled. The phantom chill of water crept up his legs again, and Emily‚Äôs ghostly voice echoed in his ears.

The guard flicked ash to the ground and muttered another prayer. ‚ÄúYou need to leave. Before the twenty-five days are up.‚Äù But the problem is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. they won‚Äôt let you.

The next afternoon, Emily skipped into the apartment, clutching a small foil bag against her chest.

‚ÄúWhere did you get that?‚Äù Daniel asked, sharper than he meant to.

‚ÄúPeter gave it to me,‚Äù she said with a smile. ‚ÄúFrom the fourth floor. He said these are his favourite.‚Äù

Daniel‚Äôs blood ran cold. He snatched the bag from her hand and tore it open.

It wasn‚Äôt chips.

Thin, brittle strips lay inside, curled and brown, with edges that looked scorched. The smell hit him first‚Äîrancid, sour, like meat left too long in the sun. He gagged, staring at the leathery pieces. They weren‚Äôt potato. They weren‚Äôt anything that belonged in a child‚Äôs snack.

Emily pouted. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you do that? He told me I‚Äôd be hungry for twenty-four nights. He said he‚Äôd bring me food every time.‚Äù

Daniel‚Äôs hand trembled. He hurled the bag off the balcony. It burst open on the street below, scattering across the pavement. For a moment, he thought he saw the pieces twitch.

That night, when Emily finally fell asleep, Daniel went to check on her. He pulled back the blanket and froze.

Another bag was tucked neatly beneath her pillow.

This one was already open‚Ä¶. And the strips inside were half-eaten.

Just then he heard the doorbell at midnight. He peeked through the peephole‚Äîand almost collapsed.

Peter and Melissa stood outside. Their faces were mangled, eyes black pits, blood dripping from their mouths. And behind them, smiling faintly, was Claire.

Except Claire was in the kitchen, humming as she washed dishes.

Daniel barricaded the door. The bell kept ringing, rhythmic and cruel. From the windows came more knocks. One by one, every light in the apartment flickered off.

Emily‚Äôs cries pierced the dark.

Daniel ran to her room.... only to find her bed soaked in blood, sheets empty. He spun wildly, until a small voice whispered behind him:

‚ÄúDaddy.‚Äù

Emily crouched in the corner. Beside her knelt Peter, skeletal hand stroking her hair. He leaned close, whispering.

Emily looked up, eyes wide, voice flat:  
‚ÄúHe says you‚Äôre next.‚Äù

That evening, Claire began to come apart. She paced the apartment with restless steps, her hair tangled, her hands trembling as she pressed them to her face. When Daniel tried to calm her, she spun on him with eyes red and wild.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore, Daniel,‚Äù she said, her voice breaking between sobs. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre letting your stories crawl into our lives. Don‚Äôt you see? You‚Äôve written about ghosts, murderers, monsters for years‚Äîand now you‚Äôve dragged them here. There‚Äôs no Peter. No Melissa. We‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ losing our minds in this place.‚Äù

Daniel shook his head, his voice rough with desperation. ‚ÄúNo, Claire, you‚Äôve seen them too. Emily has. You heard her scream. This isn‚Äôt in my head‚Äî‚Äù

But Claire pressed her palms against her ears and cried out, ‚ÄúStop! Stop, stop, stop!‚Äù She stumbled toward the balcony doors, throwing them open. The storm outside lashed at her face, soaking her hair to her shoulders.

‚ÄúMaybe if I leave, it ends!‚Äù she shouted over the roar of thunder. Her voice was raw, cracked, but filled with something frighteningly certain. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs all they want. One of us.‚Äù

Daniel lunged for her, but she twisted away, her bare feet sliding on the wet tiles. She stepped onto the railing, her body silhouetted against the lightning.

For a heartbeat, she turned back to him. Rain streamed down her cheeks, or maybe it was tears‚Äîit was impossible to tell. Her lips moved, trembling as she whispered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù There is no other way.

And before Daniel could stop her, she hurled herself over the railing.

The impact echoed like thunder.

Daniel staggered to the balcony, choking. Below, Claire‚Äôs body lay broken, blood pooling on the bricks‚Äîright where the mob had killed Peter and Melissa years ago.

The doorbell rang again.

Daniel stumbled to the peephole, chest heaving, sweat stinging his eyes.

Outside stood Peter and Melissa. Their mangled faces stared back, eyes nothing but black pits. And between them‚Ä¶ was Claire.

Her skin was pale, lips torn, eyes hollow and glassy. But when she looked at him, her expression softened. For one fleeting moment, the corners of her mouth lifted into a faint, aching smile‚Äîrecognition, love, a goodbye only he would understand.

Then she raised one finger to her lips in a silent shushing gesture, before turning to drift down the stairwell with them, her bare feet leaving no sound.

Something inside Daniel broke. He tore through drawers and closets, shoving whatever he could into bags, scooped Emily into his arms, and fled into the storm without looking back.

The Harper apartment never opened again. The doors on the sixth floor were chained, then welded shut, until eventually the whole level was sealed.

And when asked about it, Alvarez only shakes his head, mutters a prayer, and gives the same warning he has whispered for years:

1nsoacd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1nsoacd/does_plasticplace_k_trash_bag_deliver_on_quality/,Does Plasticplace K Trash Bag Deliver on Quality and Durability Review,"**Plasticplace K Trash Bags Review: Quality, Convenience, and Practicality**

The Plasticplace K Trash Bags have quickly become a staple in my household waste management routine. On paper, these may seem like just another trash bag, but this one's designed specifically for Simplehuman Code K trash cans‚Äîand that level of customization makes a tangible difference. My use of this product has spanned multiple rooms, various types of trash, and even some accidental overstuffing. Suffice to say, these bags have been put to the test.

**Custom Fit and Aesthetics**

The first thing you‚Äôll notice about these bags is how perfectly they fit. Built for Code K trash cans, the snug design eliminates any awkward overhangs. There‚Äôs no ugly bunching or wasteful extra material here, just a clean, sleek look whether I‚Äôm using it in my kitchen, bathroom, or office. I‚Äôve tried a number of generic liners before, and they always left me wrestling with excess plastic. This small upgrade genuinely keeps things looking tidy and professional. 

[Ready to snag Plasticplace K Trash Bags? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://healthquay.com/p/b07s5x9stz/)

**Tear-Resistant Durability**

Having kids and a dog means my trash often ends up harboring sharp, odd-shaped objects. Whether it‚Äôs discarded toys, food scraps, or broken plastic utensils, these bags have yet to puncture or tear on me. The 1.2 mil thick plastic is noticeably sturdier than standard trash bags, providing peace of mind that garbage day won‚Äôt turn into a mess. However, if you‚Äôre one to toss jagged glass or particularly unwieldy items, doing a quick double-check might still be wise‚Äînothing is invincible.

**Convenience at Its Best**

One feature I massively appreciate is the reinforced drawstring closure. It‚Äôs the little things, right? Not only does it make sealing the bag easy, but it also ensures nothing escapes once it‚Äôs tied up. Grab, cinch, and go‚Äîit‚Äôs that simple. Transporting heavy trash from the bin to the garage is a one-handed job now, which is crucial when wrangling a toddler in the other arm. In the office, these bags have been equally efficient, holding everything from shredded paper to coffee cups without leaking or sagging.

**Versatility Galore**

Although they‚Äôre marketed for use with Simplehuman Code K trash cans, I‚Äôve used them in other settings too, including a generic small waste bin in my bathroom. The fit here wasn‚Äôt as snug but still serviceable. Their size (10-gallon capacity) covers most small-to-medium trash cans, which adds to their flexibility. Whether it‚Äôs disposing of food scraps in the kitchen or trash from my teenager‚Äôs gaming cave, these liners handle it well. 

**Highlights**

- Tailored for Code K trash cans without messy overhangs.
- Sturdy 1.2 mil thick plastic prevents punctures, even with sharp waste.
- Smooth drawstring closure keeps garbage contained securely.
- Versatile usage across varied spaces‚Äîkitchen, bathroom, office, etc.

**Drawbacks**

- While excellent for Code K trash cans, the perfect fit doesn‚Äôt extend beyond them, making the bags less universal.
- Premium durability means they feel slightly thicker, which might not appeal to those looking for lightweight bags.
- The price per bag leans higher than cheaper bulk options out there, though I'd argue the quality justifies it.

**Competing Products**

Now, speaking of competitors, there are a few other brands producing bags for Simplehuman trash cans, such as Amazon Basics or Glad‚Äôs Flex-Plus line. Comparing the durability, however, the Plasticplace bags felt the strongest of the three. The thinner material of Amazon Basics bags left them prone to tearing, especially when used for heavier loads. Glad Flex-Plus bags, while more flexible, didn‚Äôt provide the precise fit that Plasticplace managed to nail. However, Glad does have an edge in terms of fragrance for odor control‚Äîa feature Plasticplace lacks. If you value fit and strength above scent perks, these bags truly outperform their rivals.

**Worth Every Penny**

When it comes to shopping for trash bags, the temptation to go for the cheapest option can be strong. But after multiple trials with budget-friendly alternatives, I understood quickly that scrimping isn‚Äôt always saving. These bags might come with a slightly higher price tag, but their strength, neat fit, and sheer reliability make them worth the investment. One well-made bag preventing a messy garbage disaster is worth its weight in gold. Think about it: no wasted clean-up time or doubling up poor-quality liners to avoid leaks.

1nsoa8r,https://i.redd.it/52vav873qwrf1.jpeg,Community 100 Albums Listen Through: Devin Townsend - Ziltoid the Omniscient,"I‚Äôm going to be listening to and reviewing the community‚Äôs top 100 albums after seeing the post and realising I‚Äôd not heard of more than half the bands and had only listened to 4 of the albums in full.

Today is the first artist I‚Äôve actually heard of on this list as he‚Äôs well liked by my friend, who‚Äôs probably reading this, so hey J! It‚Äôs #93: Ziltoid the Omniscient by Devin Townsend.

Rapid drums. Space-like sound effects. It‚Äôs all a bit strange, wait, what‚Äôs this about a coffee? By Your Command then rumbles in heavily. The variety and range on the vocals is great with lower, more growling tones and higher operatic reaches. Ziltoid speaks and there are quick guitars behind him to build the tension. The space vibe is reinforced with some soaring vocals and synths before they calm back down into a more soothing tone. This is short-lived though as an urgent, tense melody cuts in. Ziltoid didn‚Äôt like the coffee. There are drums and chants that sound like a war march. The story and character work is amazing. 

This continues into the next track as the attack begins. Galloping rhythms, alien like snarls, and so many different character voices create an engaging atmosphere. Layers build as the attack intensifies with wailing guitar and rapid kicks and sound effects. This all breaks away on Solar Winds. We have some narration to set the scene and continue the story, including calling Ziltoid a nerd. When the music returns there‚Äôs almost a wistful sound to it that only builds in grandeur with harmonies and synths into something more resolute. Earth is gone and the survivors seek vengeance. Driving riffs, character voices and pulsing beats bring life to the humans escaping as they enter..

Hyperdrive. This track builds some great atmosphere as the distortion and driving drums combine with some amazing vocals and a faint choir in the background to give an almost ethereal feel, like you really are flying through space. N9 then brings back some urgency in the tempo and sharper tones as they‚Äôve been found by Ziltoid. The music is doing absolute wonders to help convey the story. 

The tone shifts once more on Planet Smasher with an ominous chugging as Ziltoid makes his threats. It feels like it‚Äôs charging up with chanting and driving guitars until the guttural entrance of Planet Smasher himself. The tone then flits about depending on which character is talking, which is a great irony for the Planet Smasher as we learn his name is Herman and he hates musicals - I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre in one! Of sorts.

Omnisdimensional Creator is a brief track with narration, meditative humming and a guy that sounds like a stoner/surfer, before Color Your World hits with driving guitars and drums. The great vocal work of this album continues and there‚Äôs an atmospheric guitar passage that feels like the wind blowing, but it‚Äôs space, so there is no wind. It feels like quite a back and forth song between softer and harsher tones to depict the final confrontation between Ziltoid and the survivors, and at the end Ziltoid claims that you, he and everyone are puppets.

The Greys is then an atmospheric track with a mix of chugging rhythms, ethereal vocals, and great depth in sound, particularly with some of the guitar in the background. This then fades out and some chatter comes in to start Tall Latte. There‚Äôs someone singing to themselves. We‚Äôre in a coffee shop! The guy singing was a worker. Was the whole album just his imagination while he‚Äôs bored at work?

This was a fun album. I enjoyed the sci-fi vibes, the humour, the story and the music did an incredible job of conveying the emotion and content of it. The soundscape was often immersive and the vocals showed great range, especially with all the character voices.

1nso4oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1nso4oh/explore_the_best_coffee_machines_with_the_keurig/,Explore the Best Coffee Machines with the Keurig K-Select Review,"The Keurig K-Select Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker, model 5000198856, has been a game-changer in my mornings. As someone whose day doesn‚Äôt officially begin without coffee, I was intrigued by its promise of delivering a quick, strong, and satisfying brew. The Marine Blue color is sleek and modern, adding a fresh pop to my kitchen counter that I‚Äôve come to appreciate daily. Here's my honest take after putting this coffee maker to use for a good while.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was how compact and thoughtfully designed this coffee maker is. Although it‚Äôs not the smallest option in the market, its 11.6 x 9.2 x 12.5-inch dimensions mean it fits well even in a somewhat crowded space. The finish feels premium, and it gives off an overall sturdy and durable vibe. The large 52-ounce water reservoir at the back keeps refilling to a minimum, allowing for up to five cups without needing attention. The removable drip tray is a detail I quickly grew to love; it‚Äôs perfect for travel mugs and keeps cleanup a breeze.  

**Ease of Use**  
Using this machine has been effortless, truly living up to its reputation as a no-fuss coffee maker. It features simple button controls that make brewing a cup as easy as inserting a pod, selecting the cup size, and waiting less than a minute. I appreciated this design, especially during rushed mornings or when I‚Äôm half-asleep trying to put some caffeine in my system. The machine handles K-Cup pods brilliantly and works seamlessly with a reusable My K-Cup filter if you prefer your custom coffee grounds.

[Check Keurig K-Select 5000198856 price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b07t1dc1ns/)

**Performance and Brew Strength**  
One standout feature that truly impressed me is the strong brew option. It genuinely does intensify the flavor and gives a bold coffee experience without compromising smoothness. Typically, I lean towards a medium roast, but experimenting with dark roast pods and the strong brew function showed me how intense this little machine could get. 

The Quiet Brew Technology deserves a mention too. With past coffee makers, the early-morning clatter would wake up anyone nearby. This one operates with an impressively subdued hum, which was honestly a relief on weekends when I didn‚Äôt want to disturb anyone else in the house.

**Highlights**  
- Large 52-ounce reservoir perfect for multiple cups without frequent refilling  
- Strong brew functionality for a bold, intense coffee flavor  
- Quiet Brew Technology minimizes noise during use  
- Removable drip tray accommodates larger mugs easily  
- Compact and modern design fits into most kitchens effortlessly  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- It‚Äôs a bit bulkier than some ultra-compact brewers, which might be a consideration in smaller kitchens.  
- While the machine works great with K-Cup pods, the reusable filter isn‚Äôt included in the box and needs to be purchased separately.  
- There‚Äôs a noticeable amount of plastic in the build, which raises concerns about long-term durability for some users.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other single-serve coffee makers like the Hamilton Beach Scoop or Nespresso Vertuo Plus, the Keurig K-Select truly holds its own. While the Nespresso Vertuo Plus offers a more premium design and the ability to create specialty coffee drinks like espressos, it‚Äôs not compatible with the widespread K-Cup pods and has a higher cost of entry. The Hamilton Beach Scoop, on the other hand, comes in cheaper but sacrifices the ease of the pod system and strong brew options, making it less versatile. The Keurig strikes a great balance, offering a blend of convenience, variety, and quality without reaching an exorbitant price point.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Despite living in a world of endless coffee shop options, I‚Äôve come to realize how this machine saves you money in the long run. Instead of picking up a pricey latte every other day, I‚Äôve relied on brewing my own cup at home. The range of K-Cup pod options‚Äîranging from indulgent hot chocolates to robust black coffees‚Äîcontributes to its versatility. Factoring in the convenience, ease of use, and modern features, this coffee maker is undoubtedly a sensible investment.

1nso4gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nso4gf/what_is_the_best_coffee_grinder_for_cold_brew/,What is the best coffee grinder for cold brew?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! I've been making cold brew at home for about three years now, and I've learned quite a bit about what makes the perfect cup. Today, I want to share my experience with finding the best coffee grinder for cold brew, because let's face it - the grind makes all the difference.

When I first started, I made the rookie mistake of using pre-ground coffee. Don't get me wrong, it works, but it's not ideal. After experimenting with different grinders, I've discovered that a consistent, coarse grind is absolutely crucial for cold brew. Think sea salt size - that's what you're aiming for.

I recently discovered this amazing burr grinder (https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) that's been a game-changer for my cold brew game. It gives me that perfect coarse grind every single time, and the best part? No more inconsistent particles that make my cold brew bitter or muddy.

Here's why the right grinder matters for cold brew:

1. Coarse, even particles ensure proper extraction
2. Less sediment in your final brew
3. Smoother, less bitter taste
4. Better flavor preservation

I've found that blade grinders (you know, those cheap ones that basically chop your beans) just don't cut it. They create uneven particles, which leads to over-extraction in some areas and under-extraction in others. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!

The sweet spot for cold brew is a burr grinder with adjustable settings. This allows you to experiment with different grind sizes until you find your perfect match. I personally use this one (https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder), and it's been worth every penny.

Some pro tips I've picked up along the way:

- Clean your grinder regularly (coffee oils can go rancid)
- Grind right before brewing for maximum freshness
- Start with quality beans (garbage in = garbage out)
- Keep your grinder in a dry place
- Don't overfill the hopper

Temperature stability is also important - your grinder shouldn't heat up too much during grinding, as this can affect the flavor of your beans. The better burr grinders handle this well.

For cold brew specifically, you want to look for:
- Consistent grind size
- Minimal static buildup
- Easy cleaning
- Durable burrs
- Multiple grind settings

Remember, cold brew is a long game - it steeps for 12-24 hours. Having the right grind size means the difference between smooth, chocolatey goodness and a bitter, over-extracted mess.

Whether I‚Äôm using it for gaming, work calls, or just zoning out to some music, this wired, analog headset delivers several features worth discussing. It‚Äôs a lightweight piece of gear that aims to balance comfort and utility. However, there are also a few things to think about before taking the plunge.

**Design and Comfort**  
This headset won me over with its minimalist behind-the-head design. As someone who dislikes bulky over-ear headphones that clamp onto my head like a medieval torture device, the ClearChat Style is refreshingly lightweight, weighing just 8 ounces. It doesn‚Äôt press against my ears uncomfortably, even after hours of use. The interchangeable blue and black faceplates are a fun touch, allowing me to customize the look slightly. My nephew thought it was cool and swapped between the colors each time he borrowed it for his gaming marathons! However, those with larger heads might find the fit a bit too snug since it doesn‚Äôt offer much adjustability beyond its core design.

**Audio Quality**  
What stood out while using this headset day to day was its balanced sound profile. The dynamic audio drivers provide decent stereo sound that works great for most casual uses. I watched a couple of action-packed movies, and the sound effects came through clear without drowning out dialogue, which I appreciated. Gaming sessions were enhanced to some extent, though these headphones don‚Äôt deliver a bass-heavy experience for FPS enthusiasts who thrive on booming explosions. For podcasts or audiobooks, everything sounds crisp and clear, and the stereo reproduction captures various frequencies quite well.

**Noise-Canceling Microphone**  
The rotating, adjustable boom microphone was another pleasant surprise for me. Its noise-canceling capability holds up fairly well: background chatter and the constant hum of my PC fan all fade into the background during work meetings. My coworkers said my voice came through clearly without any muffling or weird distortions, making this headset solid for video calls. That said, I wouldn‚Äôt rank this mic in the league of high-end microphones used by streamers or professional podcasters, but it goes beyond what you‚Äôd expect at this price bracket.

**Durability and Build**  
Even though it‚Äôs a lightweight product, the build feels sturdy enough to last without falling apart at the slightest mishap. I‚Äôll admit I accidentally sat on it once, and it survived without so much as a dent, though I wouldn‚Äôt recommend testing its limits intentionally. The 3.5mm jack and wired connection seem durable, with no signs of wear and tear so far. Still, it‚Äôs not water-resistant, so it‚Äôs better to keep it away from your morning coffee spill zone.

**Benefits**  
- Comfortable and lightweight design  
- Noise-canceling microphone enhances audio clarity  
- Customizable look with interchangeable color plates  
- Stereo sound quality suitable for music, calls, and casual gaming  

**Critiques**  
- Fits snugly and may not suit those with larger heads  
- Lack of adjustable band limits customization  
- Not ideal for users seeking deep bass-heavy audio  
- No water resistance for added durability  

**Product Comparisons**  
Stacking the ClearChat Style against other wired headsets, it performs well for its price point but doesn‚Äôt dominate the competition. If you‚Äôre in it for overall audio quality, products like the HyperX Cloud Stinger might take the edge with their superior sound fidelity and better headband adjustability. On the other hand, the ClearChat‚Äôs compact behind-the-head design beats out bulkier models like the Logitech H390, especially if you‚Äôre someone like me who values portability and hates the typical over-ear pressure.

Where this headset lags in adjustability and richer audio features, it compensates in simplicity and comfort. For video calls, it undoubtedly outshines cheap earbuds that fail to deliver clear voice communication. I see it as an option tailored for casual users rather than hardcore gamers or audiophiles.

**True Value**  
What strikes me as noteworthy is how balanced the product feels considering what it offers for its price range. This headset doesn‚Äôt pretend to be something it‚Äôs not. It does what it says on the tin, without unnecessary bells and whistles. If your primary use case is crystal-clear voice chats, streaming videos, or laid-back gaming, this might just be worth the investment. But if you‚Äôre looking for an immersive audio experience, you might need to reconsider your budget and explore higher-end options.

1nso38e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Intrepid-Customer-22/comments/1nso38e/the_hydes_conflict_ff_episode_2_the_hydes/,The Hyde‚Äôs Conflict FF (Episode 2: The Hyde‚Äôs Confusion),"Hi all, I am back with a second episode.

If you missed the first episode, here is the link to it:

https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1npcbny/the_hydes_conflict_ff_episode_1_the_hydes_unlocked/

This episode like I said earlier will revolve around Tyler‚Äôs POV in S1 Epi 2 to Epi 5, hence it‚Äôs a long episode. It will be about how Tyler felt when he recalled about what he did as a Hyde and what he was thinking or feeling in the Raven episodes.
 
The episode begins.

Tyler's arms and legs were chained as he was standing one afternoon.

Fairburn comes there.

Tyler: Interested to get more information from me huh?

Fairburn: You have a visitor Tyler.

Fairburn leaves and the visitor comes.

It turns out to be his father.

Donovan: Son, how are you?

Tyler: You can see how your Hyde son is. Tied to chains. Ironic considering your job is to throw people behind bars. Oh wait, I am here because of you.

Donovan: You would have died Tyler had I not brought you here!

Tyler: Then you should have left me dying! You never cared about my existence anyway! You always hated me!

Donovan: It's not true son. Yes, I admit I wasn't a good dad to you. I was afraid that you would be a Hyde like your mother too. In fact, I found out she was a Hyde after you were born. I saw how she struggled and transformed. I was afraid that you...

Tyler: Congratulations, your son is a Hyde too, just like your liar wife!

Donovan: I know you are upset for not telling you earlier. Maybe if I had gathered courage earlier to tell you the truth, none of this would have happened.

Tyler: The Sheriff finally admits where he went wrong.

Donovan: Ty, please. Let's talk.


Tyler: Go away from here!!! Don't show me your face again if not I will kill you!!!! (roaring)

Tyler stretches his hand to strangle his father. 



Tyler gets angry and the Hyde in him awakens completely. Donovan gets teary-eyed to see his son in this form. The Hyde roared at him and he moved away as it tried to strangle and grab Donovan. The Hyde barged towards him and broke the titanium bars he was confined in.

The guards quickly went to intervene. They tried to take Tyler down but it was too much. One of them put the shock collar on and triggered his shock. He still wasn't transforming back to his human side. The Hyde hissed at him and was breaking things.

Fairburn: (worried) Mr Galphin you need to leave right now!

Donovan sadly looked at Tyler as he transformed back to his human form. Fairburn intervenes and quickly gives him a jab which gets him unconscious. Donovan walked away unwillingly as the guards took him away.

Later,
Tyler opens his eyes and he finds himself lying on the bed with his legs chained.

He finds Fairburn next to him.

Tyler: What do you want from me? Just leave me alone!

Fairburn: We are here to help you. Tyler, your father had visited you, but you got really violent. 

Tyler: Can we please not talk about it?

Fairburn: Okay fine.

Tyler looks down.

Fairburn: You didn't know initially why Thronhill controlled you to kill people. You must have found out eventually. Why did you continue, I get you were on orders but you didn't show any sort of remorse! Why? 

Tyler: I enjoyed killing people. Seeing someone terribly suffering made my heart rejoice. 

Fairburn: You should have considered therapy!

Tyler:¬† You thought I didn't! After I realised I was a Hyde, I wanted to get therapy. I would meet Kinbott for sessions. She was good, she wanted to help but she couldn't. Poor lady became one of my victims. 

Tyler recalls how he went for sessions with Kinbott.

Kinbott: Tyler, you can share with me. Anything concerning you?

Tyler shares with Kinbott how he feels his family is broken and his father doesn't really give him time. He feels sometimes his father is like a buddy but sometimes he ignores him. He stares at him as if he's someone dangerous.

Kinbott seeing Tyler sad and down changes the topic.

Kinbott: Well you do like video games right?

Tyler: I do enjoy playing FIFA but lately there is no one to play with. Especially since I don't talk with Lucas and the guys anymore. Dad also rarely gives time.

Kinbott: Hey Tyler, it's okay. I play video games too. You can come over when you feel like. 

Tyler: Appreciate it!

Tyler left and he walked home. He saw his father going on his duty soon with the police dog - Elvis.

Tyler: Hey where are you going with Elvis?

Donovan: To follow a lead in a case.

Tyler: (worried) You still believe there is a creature out there! Don't you?! I heard you and Santiago talking about it. You think it's a Nevermore kid?!

Donovan changes the topic and asks what he and Kinbott talk about during the sessions and he told him, while his dad was leaving anyway until

Tyler: We talk about mom! Remember her?

Donovan: (pretends he didn't listen) Better not be talking crap about your old man! I will be out late. You are on your own?!

Donovan drove away and Tyler went sarcastic about having a grill and watching the big game, both of which rarely happened. He walked away being used to it.

Tyler then remembers Thornhill told him to ruin evidence that could expose him as Rowan's killer. Tyler decides to go to the scene too to get rid of potential evidence before he gets to them.

He spots Wednesday. He realises his dad may throw Wednesday behind bars if he finds her roaming around moreover his dislike for the Addams. He immediately runs and covers Wednesday's mouth when his father is nearby investigating a crime scene to ensure the dog doesn't pick up her scent.

He shares with her how the coffee he got from the cafe in his pocket prevents the dog from smelling.

Tyler: You must be thinking it's weird that I am stalking my dad.

Wednesday: No! I constantly stalk my parents too!

As she walked away to look for something, he knew she was looking for evidence.

Tyler: Hey what happened at the festival the other day? Look I swear, I won't tell my dad anything!

Wednesday tells him how she went to protect Rowan from danger but instead he attacked her and tried to choke her. 

Wednesday: That's when the monster came out of his shadows and gutted him.

Tyler: (sarcastic) Woah woah! So you really saw it? And it didn't kill you?!

Wednesday: Surprisingly it saved me from Rowan. That's the part I was trying to figure out. I need evidences to prove that I have not lost my mind.

Just then she finds broken glasses of Rowan and she gets her Psychic vision while touching them while Tyler looks at her confused as she is in her Psychic world.

Tyler: (in his mind) Wednesday, the monster was trying to save you for helping him the other day. I  hope you never find out I was the monster.

Wednesday gets back to normal.

Tyler: You okay?

Wednesday nods and leaves. Tyler then leaves immediately before his father comes back.

He then remembers,
It was Outreach Day where outcasts would work with normies for a day.

Tyler: Xavier, I hope you got the assignment. You can ask me if there is anything you are unsure about.

Xavier: Can I tell you something?

Tyler: Sure?

Xavier: Stay away from Wednesday!

Tyler: Wednesday? Is she your friend too?

Xavier: Yes. And I do not like seeing her spend time with you. 

Tyler: It is not up to me who Wednesday wants to spend time with! Anyway, just carry on with what you are doing. I think it's better if we don't speak to each other unless needed.

Xavier nods and goes to pick a tray of coffee.

Tyler is doing his duty and then he spots Wednesday.

Xavier: Looking for me?

Wednesday:  I am actually here for Tyler. 

Xavier: Told you he was bad news!

Wednesday: Twice! But who I speak to is my business! 

Xavier became disappointed. Tyler smiled from a distant hearing that and he came to Wednesday as she rang the bell and Xavier left.

Tyler: You rang? You want the usual?

Wednesday: And some help.

She laid out a map on the table and asked him about the pilgrim meeting house and where it was located.

Tyler: What's this about?

Wednesday: Nothing.

Tyler: You are becoming obsessed with this whole monster in the woods thing!

Wednesday: Would I rather develop feelings for horses and boys bands?

Tyler smiled as she admitted she was obsessed with the monster, which was him!

Wednesday: Thank you for the help.

Tyler offered to accompany her but she refused saying she preferred doing it alone and left. 

Tyler: You were in Girl Scouts?

Wednesday: I could eat Girl Scouts for breakfast. Actually, my uncle went to prison for it.

Wednesday left as Tyler became a little disappointed that Wednesday preferred to be alone rather than with him.

Flashback ends.
 
Present,
Tyler: I liked spending time and helping on Wednesday. And so did she. She was different...

Tyler smiled whenever he was with Wednesday and admired her. He also did some research on Wednesday but searched her name and found out she put piranhas in a swimming pool in her previous school. Maybe there was someone out there who was as dark as him.

Tyler: But me turning into a Hyde and killing people, it slowly got out of control.

Tyler: It got more frequent, till it became a daily routine. Day by day I was becoming less Tyler and more like the Hyde I would go to random places and kill someone. Initially, I didn't recall everything I did. I remembered killing Rowan but not every victim. Gradually, I started remembering everything...

Tyler recalls how he was taking a bath silently after he killed someone innocent and he drowned in the bath slowly and he recalled the scene. He started to remember and realise the casualties he caused.

He shouted and cried as he saw the person struggling in death while he slashed them.




Tyler: That moment I wished I were dead. But even that was beyond my control...

Fairburn feels bad for Tyler.

Tyler starts laughing out like an evil person.

Tyler: Gotcha! You felt so sorry for me, it was fun to see. But I do not need anyone's sympathy.

Fairburn: Seriously! You are manipulative!

Fairburn left annoyed. Tyler himself
knew whatever he said was all true. But he didn't want anyone to feel sorry for him. 

Tyler recalls how he was working a shift and he noticed Nevemore students and normies discussing their excitement about the Rave N dance on weekends.

Then he sees Lucas talking with a Nevermore student.



Lucas: See you this weekend Enid.

Enid: You too. Cannot wait for the Rave N Dance!

Lucas helps Enid as she leaves Weathervane.

Tyler: So finally you are interested in someone from Nevermore.

Lucas: None of your business Galphin! What are you going to do, tell Wednesday I am her room-mate Enid's partner in Rave N dance?!

Tyler: I am sure Wednesday will see it herself anyway. But are you actually interested in Enid?

Lucas: No, we joined hands to make someone else jealous. Enid is making that Gorgon guy, Ajax jealous.

Tyler: You have not even been dating anyone for a while. Lucas are you guys planning something? Any stupid prank?

Lucas: How does it matter to you if we are going to do so? What are you going to do complain to your goth girlfriend?

Tyler: Wednesday is not my girlfriend, Lucas. She is my friend.

Lucas: You're kidding right? Cmon man. Stop lying to yourself. You clearly have feelings for her and it seems she does too. She keeps a distance from others but she stays close to you. She clearly is interested.

Tyler: Wait...you think so?!

Lucas: And I don't understand man why are you soft towards outcasts suddenly, I used to like you better when you were not. We were best friends Tyler! How did you change so much?!

Tyler: Forget I asked. My shift ended anyway.

Tyler ends his shift and is about to go back home and he spots Wednesday.

Tyler: Wednesday!

Wednesday looks at Tyler with Thing on her right shoulder.

Tyler: What trouble are you looking for now?
I heard there is Rave N dance in Nevermore this weekend. 

Wednesday: (whispering) I must be the only one not obsessed with this stupid dance thing.

Tyler: So, are you going to take someone as your partner?

Wednesday: Xavier!

Tyler's expressions changed hearing this.

Tyler: Hope you two have fun.

Tyler is about to leave.

Wednesday:¬† Not sure why you look upset.

Tyler: That's kind of the problem. I mean, call me crazy Wednesday, you keep giving me these signals.

Wednesday: It's not my fault I cannot interpret your emotional, Morse code.

Tyler: Then let me spell it out. I thought we liked each other and then you pull out something like this. Am I in the more-than-friend zone or just a pawn in some game you are playing?

Wednesday: It's just that I am dealing with a lot right now. I need to prioritise. 

Tyler: I guess give me a call if I ever move up to your to-do list.

Tyler leaves upset. He goes and sits in his car. He didn't believe what he just said to Wednesday.

Tyler: (in his mind) Oh my god, what did I just do?! Lucas's words got into my mind. What was I thinking?! Anyway, what's the point she is more interested in Xavier, if not she won't have taken him to the dance! It's just a dance why am I getting so affected by it!

Tyler drives his car to divert his attention.

The next day,
Tyler is working at Weathervane and he hears someone ring the bell twice. He looked behind and saw no one but a letter in the tip jar.



Tyler picked the letter and read it.



Tyler,
I have reconsidered my decision to choose my partner in the Rave'N. Pick me up at Ophelia Hall. Don't be late
W
P.S. coreage optional.

Tyler smiled seeing the letter. It made his day. 

He was in a good mood the whole day. Right after the shift ended he went to a session with Kinbott.

Kinbott: Someone looks to be in a good mood today.

Tyler: Actually I will be going to do Rave'N dance in Nevermore.

Kinbott: Who is your partner?

Tyler: (proud) Wednesday Addams

Kinbott: You have got a very interesting partner Tyler. Trust me you won't be bored with her, she is cool in her own way.

Tyler: (smiling) She is!

Tyler talks with Kinbott about his concerns and family issues. He tells Kinbott he misses his mother a lot, but he is trying to cope. Kinbott was glad to see Tyler in a happy mood after a long time especially how happy he is whenever he speaks about Wednesday.

After his session, he went straight home and went to his room. He opened the wardrobe and found a white suit and a blue shirt. He gets ready for the dance.

He went to Nevermore and sneakily went to Wednesday's room. He knocked on the door smiling.

Wednesday looked surprised as she opened the door and she was dressed in a black coat as if she was planning to go somewhere else.



Wednesday: Tyler...

Tyler: I got your invite. Guess you had Thing leave it in the tip jar.

Wednesday: Good guess.

Tyler: After our last conversation, I wasn't sure I would speak to you again, but... well your note is so genuine and sweet. Totally took me by surprise. 

Wednesday: Me too. 

Tyler: Well now that I am here, glad I came. You need a few minutes?

Wednesday immediately closed the door.

He could hear Wednesday saying to Thing, ""Genuine and sweet, how could you do this?""

Tyler understood from Wednesday's glance that it was Thing who wrote the letter. But he decided to wait anyway.

Tyler left and he went downstairs. As he was waiting for Wednesday, he came across the pictures of Nevermore's fencing team years back.

He walked towards it and he saw his mom in that picture.

Tyler: (in his mind) So mom was a student at Nevermore too! She used to like fencing. Dad never told me any of these things. I wish I could know more about mom...

Just then Tyler heard some steps and he looked up. 



He sees Wednesday in a black attire well suited for the Rave' N dance. She had a different hairstyle from her usual braids. She was adjusting her dress as she was walking down. He admired her. She looked amazing in that dress!¬† He was speechless! It was the most beautiful thing he had seen! Wednesday Addams is killing him in her own ways!




Tyler: Wow! You look...

Wednesday: Unrecognizable? Ridiculous? A classic example of female objectification for the male gaze?

Tyler: (completes) Amazing! I mean it Wednesday. You look beautiful.

Just then a boy comes to Wednesday. 

Wednesday: Eugene?



From the discussion between Eugene and Wednesday, they had plans to stake out the cave. Wednesday told Eugene they will go together tomorrow and not to do so today as it will be dangerous for him to go alone. 

Tyler: (in his mind) Wednesday acts tough but she has a caring side...

Tyler: Stalking out of the cave huh?

Wednesday: Yes, I wanted to check out the cave with Eugene. We would surely find something.



As they come to the venue, some of the students look surprised to see Wednesday there.

Just then Thronhill comes there,
Thronhill: Wednesday Addams what a lovely surprise!

Tyler looked at Thronhill.
Wednesday: Ms Thronhill, this is Tyler...

Thronhill: Galphin!

Tyler: Um yeah. Double cap, no foam, 2 pumps and sugar-free vanilla.

Thronhill: It is hard to keep secrets in this town!

Tyler gets afraid hearing these words but he kept his smile to not make it obvious.

Wednesday: I am getting us some drinks!

Wednesday leaves and Tyler gets nervous. Thronhill laughs.

Thronhill: Looks like you are getting closer to Wednesday than you were supposed to Tyler.

Tyler: Umm

Thronhill: Tell me what you found out from her.

Tyler: She was supposed to go stalk the cave with a boy, I think he's some hummer.

Thronhill: Must be Eugene.

Tyler: Yeah him. 

Thronhill: Just hang around and stay with Wednesday, I will tell you when I need your help.
I have some things to settle first. 

Thronhill goes. Tyler sighs a relief as she is gone. He feels obliged to listen to every word she says, but deep down he doesn't like being controlled. He wondered how Wednesday would react if she 
found out he was the monster that she was searching for.

Just then he hears Enid and Lucas talking, and Enid goes. Lucas looks guilty.

Tyler: There is still time Lucas, don't do it...whatever you are intending to!

Tyler leaves to find Wednesday as Lucas gets thinking.

He sees Wednesday sitting looking uninterested.


Wednesday: Xavier told me what you did last year. How you and his friends destroyed his mural on Outreach Day.

Tyler: (in his mind) Of course she had to find out from Xavier what I did. 

Whatever he did with Xavier he knows he was wrong.

Tyler did not deny what he and his friends did and he told her he did not know why he did that. And then he went to 'boot camp' he was sent to. He recalls how he became a Hyde.

Tyler: Look I did a terrible thing, but I am not a terrible person.

Wednesday: Do you think I was going to judge you for a silly prank? I would have taken it further.

Tyler mentioned like putting piranhas in a swimming pool which surprised Wednesday and he told her how he did some digging up on her. 

Wednesday: I will do it again!

Tyler: I knew there was a reason I liked you!

Tyler smiled as he thought maybe he just found someone who was similar to him and could accept the real him.

They both went to the dance together. They danced together. Wednesday danced and made her own moves that defined her kookiness well.



 Tyler smiled as he admired her confidence. 
He has never been this happy and comfortable with someone before.

And then he saw that Wednesday was gone and he got thinking. And just then he feels someone tapping him and he looks behind and find Wednesday, who then continues her unique dance. 

Now he understood why he was so enchanted by her.



Just then there were leaks of blood falling and the whole white and blue scene turned red with the blood rain. As Tyler saw the blood stain he recalled the scenes how he would turn into a Hyde and attack people as they lay in a pool of blood? 

Tyler looked at Wednesday who unlike others smiling and enjoying the whole scene.

Tyler: (in his mind) Would Wednesday accept me if she finds out I was the monster she is looking for?

Wednesday tasted the blood.



But soon became disappointed.

Wednesday: This is paint!

Tyler understood it must probably be a prank by Lucas and his friends. People were slipping and running as there was panic and chaos.

Tyler was also running too to look for Lucas to confront him.

Just then Tyler gets a message from Thronhill.

Thronhill: Tyler go to the cave now. There is a mess you need to clear. I am waiting for you.

Tyler: Can I come later?

Thronhill: Take care of it now!

Tyler: On it! 

Tyler wanted to say bye to Wednesday before he left and then he collided with Xavier. 

Tyler: Did you see Wednesday? I lost her in the crowds

Xavier: How would I know? She is your date.

Tyler gets another message from Thronhill.

Thronhill: Right now!

Tyler goes and he runs to the woods. He finds Thronhill.

Thronhill: Wednesday got a vision that Eugene was in the woods. We have to finish him off! Attack Eugene!

Tyler: Do I have to?

Thronhill: (touching)Tyler listen to what Mama says!

Tyler turns into a Hyde and then he looks for Eugene. He attacks Eugene who is helpless and leaves him struggling for his life. Tyler turns into a helpless human.

Thronhill: Now leave before Wednedsay sees you! I am sure she will be coming here to rescue her friend.

Tyler recalls how he met Thronhill the next day.

Thronhill: Tyler?

Tyler: I cannot do this anymore. I do not want to be a Hyde anymore! Please free me from this! Wednesday, she needs to know about this. I have to tell her my truth.

Thronhil: Before you tell her, there is something you need to know. What if I tell you, Wednesday's family had a hand in your mother's tragic end?

Tyler: Wait what do you mean?

Thronhill: As you know your mother died because the Hyde in her triggered due to her postpartum depression. But what if I tell you your mother had a chance to become a normie, to get rid of her Hyde abilities forever!

Tyler: She did? Then why she couldn't.

Thronhill: Morticia Addams. Wednesday's mother. Your mother wanted to be a normie. She had the chance to be a normie as part as an experiment by her brother Isaac Night. She took part of it. But Morticia Addams she ruined it! She ruined the machine and gone was the chance for your mother to become a normie!

Tyler: How do you know about this? 

Thronhill: I have a secret too. I am not Mariyln Thronhill, this is my fake name. My actual name is Laurel Gates.

Tyler is confused.

Thronhill: Morticia Addams, she used to be with my brother, Gareth Gates. But she used him, my brother was crazy about her. The couple stabbed and pushed my brother and he fell to his death!

Thronhill cries and Tyler shows sympathy.

Tyler feels bad for Thronhill and he couldn't believe what he heard. He should have stay away from Wednesday! His dad warned him. Her family killed people for pleasure, but he did too...But he was a Hyde who couldn't control himself?!

Thronhill: (holding Tyler's hand tightly) Don't tell Wednesday ! Remember she is not your friend but your enemy. I know what is going through you now, but I care for you. I am like your mother.

1nsnuwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nsnuwb/we_havent_said_i_love_you/,"We haven't said ""I love you""","I 25F have been with my boyfriend 26M for a little over 4 months now and we haven't said 'I love you'. When I tell friends about this they ask if I love him and it always gives me pause. I do a lot for him, I'm constantly running him home made meals, baked goods and I'm there for him when he needs me. I've met all his friends and I absolutely adore his family. He went on a trip recently and in that time I hung out with his sister and her family unit twice in that time. Spending time with his friends and family without him is actually becoming quite common and I enjoy it equally when he is or isn't there. 

We mutually planned our first date, it was a simple get to know you at a coffee shop that went well enough. He was living with his parents at the time and said they were kind of like his 'roommates'. I pointed out they weren‚Äôt really roommates since he wasn't paying rent to which he said he cooked from time to time and they got under his skin enough to call it even. This rubbed me the wrong way as someone who has never had a particularly close family it felt like he was taking what he had for granted. 

I planned and paid for our second date, I brought him coffee and took him kayaking. He asked me to be his girlfriend after this which felt a little fast but I agreed. We haven't been on another date since. 

I have a standing invitation to game nights at his sisters place which we go to almost weekly. But outside of hang outs he'd be going to whether I was there or not if I want to hang out with him I have to be the one to reach out and schedule it. 

We haven't fought, the closest we've come to an argument was when he was coming back from his recent two week trip. I had dropped him and his friend 28M off at the airport, when I did i asked him how he planned to get home after his return trip to which he told me he hadn't planned it yet. I told him I could likely pick him up but my schedule was going to be a lot busier so I would need to know details in advance if that's what we were going to try to do. (We live around an hour and twenty minutes from the airport).

When he was two days from returning home i was at his sisters place when his parents dropped by briefly. We exchanged pleasantries and they asked when he was set to come home, I told them the day of the week and they asked what time I was picking him up. I told them I didnt have any of his flight information and that we hadn't made any plans in that realm. They were confused and said they were told that was the plan. They called him and asked how he was getting home to which he replied that I would be getting him. His parents exchanged a glance with me and asked if I had been made aware to which he replied that scheduling was a 'problem for the next day'. They told him i was in the room and he lazily asked if I could pick him up. His mom sent me his flight itinerary after. His parents got upset with him and told him he shouldn't drop something like that on me with such little notice.

His flight ended up being delayed by several hours, I drove to the airport at 2200 picked him up at 0000 where i found out his friend ALSO needed a ride home (in another city). Got home at 0200 and then left for work at 0600. 

After the airport incident I sat him down and told him I was mad at him. I told him I often make him a priority in my life and it feels like I'm a second thought in his.  I was upset that everyone knew the plan but me, that they were all let in on it but I was the only one it really affected. He apologised and said he had been talking logistics with so many people that he forgot who he had told what and thought everyone knew the same plan. He said telling me had slipped his mind but he could see how it was frustrating. I forgave him and we moved on.

My past relationships haven't been great, they've all been varying flavours of abusive. I feel i don't have a good reference for what is normal in a relationship because of this. I recently moved to the area we're in and don't have family or friends in the state so spending time with his has been really refreshing. 

He's nice to me, I never have to be afraid of him hurting me and I get along great with his family. It feels tepid, like the kind of thing that could go on forever if I let it and it would still be the same level of 'okay'. I can't help but feel my presence has no impact on his life. Unless I'm the one planning everything the things we do are things he would be doing whether I was there or not. 

I'm finally with someone who is safe, he's nice to me, has a decent job and i get along with people in his orbit. I tell him my problems and he will listen, we're sexually compatible and even though he may not fully understand when I have vulnerable moments (panic attacks at night, flinching, needing space to gather myself) he's respectful and only expects me to tell him what I'm comfortable with. This is the best relationship I've had, so why do I feel so alone?

1nsnujw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nsnujw/can_waterdrop_wdtsuw_undersink_water_filter_live/,Can Waterdrop WD-TSU-W Under-Sink Water Filter Live Up to the Hype Review?,"**Sleek Design and Build**  
Using the Waterdrop WD-TSU-W for the past few weeks, I‚Äôve grown quite fond of its compact design. Its dimensions‚Äî14.81""L x 4.68""W x 13.97""H‚Äîfit snugly under my kitchen sink, which is already loaded with a garbage disposal. Space-saving was a critical factor for me, and this filter solves that issue while maintaining accessibility. The premium nickel faucet it comes with feels sturdy and adds a touch of elegance to my kitchen countertop. Setting it up didn‚Äôt require professional help either‚Äîeverything was in the box, and I had it installed with minimal effort.  

**Smart Panel Features**  
One thing that sets this under-sink water filter apart is its smart lifespan reminder. The sleek black panel, equipped with four indicator lights, takes the guesswork out of maintenance. I always used to forget when it was time to change the filters in previous systems I‚Äôve owned. This indicator system ensures that I swap out filters on time, which is quite the relief for someone as forgetful as me!  

[Check Waterdrop WD-TSU-W price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b086yh42qp/)  

**Effortless Water Quality**  
The most noticeable change after installing this system was the water taste. This 0.01-micron ultrafiltration system efficiently filters out impurities such as chlorine, PFAS, and heavy metals. Yet, it retains essential minerals‚Äîa win for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want the flat taste often associated with reverse osmosis systems. Every cup of coffee, pot of tea, and cooked meal since switching has tasted fresher.  

**Eco-Friendly Choice**  
A huge win for me was the eco-conscious operation of this filter. Unlike reverse osmosis systems, this one wastes no water. I had read some reviews pointing out that RO systems lose gallons during filtration, which made me choose this option. The Waterdrop WD-TSU-W doesn‚Äôt require electricity either, making it even more energy-efficient and environment-friendly. Plus, there‚Äôs no drain line needed‚Äîsomething that saved me from extra plumbing hassles.  

**Benefits**  
- Compact design fits into tight cabinet spaces.  
- Smart lifespan reminder simplifies maintenance.  
- Preserves essential minerals while filtering impurities.  
- No wastewater or electricity usage, helping the environment.  

**Shortcomings**  
- It does not reduce TDS (Total Dissolved Solids); those who need this feature should consider an RO system.  
- The black panel design can attract smudges, requiring regular cleaning.  

**Filter Lifespan and Cost Efficiency**  
The longevity of the filters truly amazed me. The ultrafiltration (UF) membrane has a lifespan of 24 months, while the carbon block filter lasts 12 months, and the pre-sediment filter lasts 6 months. Such durability reduces the hassle and cost of frequent replacements. Considering maintenance frequency and the benefits of clean water, this system delivers excellent value.  

**Product Competitors**  
Several systems compete with the Waterdrop WD-TSU-W. Comparing it to the APEC ROES-50, the latter offers lower TDS levels due to its reverse osmosis technology. However, the APEC wastes significant water and requires extra space for a storage tank, which could deter some buyers. Brita‚Äôs filter systems, meanwhile, offer an affordable option but can‚Äôt achieve the same advanced filtration as this product. The Waterdrop WD-TSU-W emerges as a practical choice for users prioritizing eco-friendliness, compact dimensions, and maintenance ease.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
For what it offers, this system is a smart investment. Its upfront cost is justifiable when considering the long filter lifespans, maintenance reminders, and the elimination of wastewater. If you‚Äôre tired of lugging around bottled water or replacing countertop pitchers, this is a game-changer.

1nsnug3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1nsnug3/tesofensine_for_audhd/,Tesofensine for AuDHD,"Hello! I wanted to share my experiences with Tesofensine, as a substance that‚Äôs been really helpful for me as someone with AuDHD (autism + ADHD traits). I‚Äôve been taking tesofensine, a drug originally studied for Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs, now being studied as an obesity drug, that works as a triple reuptake inhibitor, for about 2.5 months. It slows the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin all at once. 

That‚Äôs significant because most ADHD meds only affect dopamine and norepinephrine, while antidepressants usually only target serotonin and norepinephrine. For me, that triple effect seems to support both the executive dysfunction side of ADHD and the emotional/sensory regulation side of autism.

Since starting tesofensine, I can start and finish tasks much more easily, switch tasks and ‚Äúaim‚Äù my attention a lot easier. My focus at work, consistency and performance has improved and i feel like the cycles of procrastination then fevered productivity has smoothed out. Deadlines are easier to hit. 

My house is cleaner, I‚Äôve been reorganizing, exercising, and even reading books on the stuff I‚Äôm interested in again. My anxiety, especially social anxiety, has dropped a lot, and I have far fewer ‚Äúbad‚Äù days. I think part of this is because I need less caffeine. I used to drink 3+ cups of coffee a day (sometimes more when tired), but now I only need one or two at most. 

With a very busy life (full-time job, two kids, dating, friends, hobbies), I‚Äôve also needed fewer ‚Äúdown days‚Äù of deep rest than I used to as an autistic person. I still get social hangovers when I‚Äôve had to high-mask, but they‚Äôre not as draining. I‚Äôve also been able to unmask more often because my social anxiety is lower. It hasn‚Äôt improved my ability to interpret social cues, but I feel less self-conscious if I don‚Äôt understand something or make mistakes.

Tesofensine has also affected my appetite and sleep. I don‚Äôt feel hunger or tiredness as much mentally, but I notice the physical signals like a rumbling stomach, low energy, dry eyes, or muscle fatigue. If I eat I still enjoy food and feel satisfied, so it doesn‚Äôt effect the flavour or taste or even experience of food. As long as I lie down and close my eyes, I can fall asleep easily, and I‚Äôm getting over 7 hours of sleep a night. I can even nap during the day if I lie down in a dark comfy place. 

I‚Äôve lost about 7 pounds in two and a half months, which feels like a healthy pace. I have about 10lbs of ‚Äúexcess‚Äù weight on me that I don‚Äôt need to lose but also I wouldn‚Äôt mind to lose. If I lose more than that I‚Äôd be concerned though. I am an avid boulderer, and my rock climbing has improved because of the weight loss and because I have more energy and strength.

Because Tesofensine has a long half-life(9 days), I started with 0.25 mg every other day, then moved to 0.25 mg daily. Now I take 0.25 on weekends and 0.5 on weekdays, unless I feel like I need more sleep, then I keep it at 0.25. Going slow and adjusting gradually has kept things stable.

For me, tesofensine has been life-changing for both mental health and executive functioning. I finally feel like I have the balance I‚Äôve been looking for: energy, focus, reduced anxiety, and emotional steadiness, without feeling overstimulated or dulled. 

In the past, I have hated the typical anxiety meds and ssris as they made me feel like not myself, dissociated and dull without actually addressing the root of my anxiety. 

I‚Äôve also tried a bunch of ADHD meds, and they all made me feel super stimmy, euphoric at effective doses, and while I‚Äôve felt ‚Äúup‚Äù and able to do more, my ability to direct my focus on what actually needed to be done didn‚Äôt change. I also felt more anxious and paranoid on several ADHD drugs. 

Tesofensine does not give me euphoric feelings, doesn‚Äôt make me feel stimmy and lowers my anxiety. 

I know it‚Äôs not an approved medication for this use, and I don‚Äôt think anyone is even studying it for AuDHD, but I thought I‚Äôd share my experience in case it helps others. Has anyone else tried tesofensine, or noticed similar benefits from other medications or supplements that affect dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin together? 

I‚Äôm going to cycle-out at 6 months for a full month and then start up again (as is recommended by my source provider, who sells it for weight loss for the lifting community.)

If there is interest I will post my experiences then as well!",6,1759064705.0,NooTopics,10,0.88,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking info for the hot milk show at rec room this weekend. that area can get a little hectic so it's good to have a plan.  
  
honestly the easiest thing i've found is using an app called Prked. it lets you rent someone's private driveway or garage right next to the Rec Room. it's usually way cheaper than the public lots and you get to completely skip the traffic chaos trying to get into a packed garage. you just park and it's a super short walk to the venue.  
  
if you don't go that route, your next best bet is street parking. since the show is on a saturday, the street parking on chippewa, franklin, and delaware ave is free all day. you might have to circle a bit to find a spot if you get there late, but you can't beat the price.  
  
there are also a bunch of paid lots all within a block or two of the club. there are some cheaper ones for around $5 behind the Spot Coffee on delaware and franklin. just a heads up, ALL the lots around there require payment no matter what time it is, so don't assume they're free just because it's the weekend. you can also use apps like spothero to reserve a spot in one of those lots ahead of time, which can save some stress. prices look like they're anywhere from 6 to 15 bucks for the night.  
  
so yeah, you've got options. i'd just get there a little early if you're trying for a free street spot.  
  
hope this helps, the show is gonna be awesome.",1,1759064611.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

In **Madison County, Indiana**, families have been told to **drink and shower in** ***neon yellow water.*** Not an exaggeration photos show coffee pots full of what looks like antifreeze, bathtubs filled with glowing yellow liquid.

* **Erin Brockovich** herself just stepped in, calling on officials to act.
* The **Daily Mail** ran it front page: *‚ÄúErin Brockovich demands action from Madison County officials as residents told to drink and shower in neon water.‚Äù*
* MSN has it blasted across their feeds: *‚ÄúDiscolored water in Madison County catches attention of activist Erin Brockovich.‚Äù*
* Locals are comparing it to the Julia Roberts movie, and they‚Äôre not wrong.

üëâ Cancer clusters reported in neighborhoods.  
üëâ Residents saying they‚Äôve never been this sick since moving back.  
üëâ Independent labs confirmed **E. coli in the water, lead, and extremely low Chlorine.**  
üëâ IDEM (state regulators) were literally **caught bleach-bagging faucets** to fake chlorine readings.

And the response from ‚Äúleaders‚Äù? **‚ÄúFill out a form.‚Äù** ü§° Meanwhile people are buying bottled water to make baby formula, paying sky-high bills for water they can‚Äôt drink, and documenting **86+ medical visits** since moving there.

The people of Madison County are signing **tort claims left and right** and are organizing into the thousands. 

If you want to see what corruption, negligence, and everyday resilience look like, start paying attention to this story.

1nsnruc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nsnruc/aita_for_being_honest_about_my_husbands_education/,AITA for being honest about my husband's education and career when his social status was embarrassing me at our son's wedding reception?,"I spent twenty minutes at my son's wedding reception telling my affair partner's family how pathetic my husband looked in his rented tux while they laughed at his community college degree.

My husband heard every word. He was standing right behind me.

I met my side guy at the country club two years ago. My husband doesn't play golf, never wanted to learn. Said he'd rather spend weekends fixing up rental properties than ""chasing a little white ball."" That should have been my first clue we weren't compatible anymore.

The affair started slow. Coffee after tennis. Drinks at the club bar. Then hotel rooms on Wednesday afternoons when my husband thought I was at book club. I told myself I deserved this. Twenty-three years of marriage to a man who thought a nice dinner meant Olive Garden.

My side guy came from money. Real money. The kind where people had wings named after them at hospitals. His family owned half the commercial real estate in town. When he invited me to charity galas, I felt like I finally belonged somewhere.

At my son's wedding, my husband sat at the head table looking uncomfortable. He kept tugging at his bow tie. My side guy was there with his wife, naturally. We'd agreed to be discreet. But his family members kept finding me, making little comments.

""Oh, you're married to the landlord,"" his sister said, looking at my husband. ""How quaint.""

I should have walked away. Instead, I laughed. ""He thinks he's some real estate mogul with his five duplexes.""

""Community college business degree?"" his brother asked.

""Barely that. Took him six years part-time while working construction.""

They howled. I felt sophisticated. Chosen. Like I was finally among my people.

""Must be strange,"" the sister said, ""being with someone so... basic. When you're clearly meant for better things.""

""You have no idea. He wanted to honeymoon in Branson. I had to beg for Cancun.""

""At least your son turned out well. Sometimes genetics skip a generation.""

That's when I felt him. That presence you know after two decades. I turned around and my husband was standing there, holding two champagne glasses. His face was completely blank.

""Thought you might be thirsty,"" he said, handing me a glass. Then he walked away.

The rest of the reception was a blur. My husband gave a beautiful toast about watching our son grow into a man of integrity. He danced with our daughter. Shook hands. Smiled for photos. Never looked at me once.

I thought I'd gotten away with it. He didn't make a scene. Didn't confront me. We drove home in silence and he slept in the guest room. Pretty standard for us lately.

Three days later, I came home to printed screenshots covering our kitchen table. Every text. Every email. Every hotel receipt I'd hidden. Two years of evidence arranged chronologically.

But that wasn't the revenge.

He'd sent it all to my children the night before. Along with audio from the wedding. Turns out my son's best man had been recording speeches on his phone near where I was standing. Got every word of my little performance.

My daughter called me sobbing. ""You made fun of Dad to those people? While he was bringing you champagne?""

My son was worse. He just texted: ""I can't believe you did that at my wedding.""

Then my husband's lawyer contacted me. Not for divorce papers. For a cease and desist. See, those rental properties I mocked? He'd built that into a proper business. An LLC. One where I was listed as co-owner for tax purposes. The lawyer informed me I'd been removed from all accounts and properties due to ""breach of fiduciary duty.""

My side guy? Ghosted me the second my husband sent screenshots to his wife. Turns out his family's real estate company had multiple dealings with my husband's ""pathetic five duplexes."" They needed his properties for some development deal.

The country club revoked my membership. Said it was for ""unpaid dues"" but we all knew. My book club found out. The PTA board asked me to step down. Twenty years of building a life in this town, gone in a week.

My husband filed for divorce on grounds of adultery with a prenup I'd forgotten I signed. I was so in love back then, I didn't care about protecting myself.

He kept the house. The business. Even our friend group chose him. Turns out people really liked the guy who'd helped them fix leaky faucets at 2 AM and never asked for anything in return.

I'm living in a studio apartment now. My kids visit him every weekend. They barely return my texts. Last week I saw my husband at the grocery store with a woman from his property management company. She was laughing at something he said. Really laughing, not the polite country club kind.

He nodded at me. Polite. Distant. Like I was someone he used to know.

The thing that kills me? At the mediation, his lawyer mentioned that my husband had suspected the affair for months. Had the evidence ready. Was going to confront me after our son's wedding to avoid drama. Then he heard me trashing him to my boyfriend's family. At our son's wedding. While he was bringing me champagne.

""That changed the timeline,"" the lawyer said.

So Reddit, AITA for thinking I'd won when I was really just digging my own grave?

* **Titan Skinn Raw Instinct** : Gave this to my father and the cute lil smirk on his face after the first spray said it all. opens fresh and citrusy with bergamot and lemon, balanced by a spicy aromatic heart.

DiDi was incredibly convenient and affordable, a 30 min ride cost us around $3-5 USD, compared to 0.50 cents for trains. Our airport to hotel hour long ride was $9 usd. There was an instance where our 15min ride was only $1.

It was a pleasant surprise how far our dollars went for the value we got in return. Sometimes it felt like we didn't have to look at prices and just ordered whatever we wanted. This is something we're bummed about after returning home.

I think their train system is quite expansive and affordable, but the one time we took the train, we still had to walk 15 minutes from the station to the place. It just felt like a waste of time.

Meals were very affordable, a fancy sit down restaurant with 4-5 dishes cost around $50 USD for 2 people. We had a fancy Peking duck meal with 3 other dishes for $55 at a place with their own private elevator at the mall.

People were friendly and some even went out of their way to help us with directions conversing in the little mandarin we had under our belt.

We felt very safe, day and night, even when we walking back to the hotel around midnight. There were two occasions where I left my bag only to find it in the same spot coming back 10 minutes later (one was on the airplane and second was in a Huawei car in their showroom with tons of people going in and out).

The traditional Chinese breakfast consisting of a congee, steamed buns, and a fried dough cost around $2-5 USD for 2 people. Chinese breakfast pancakes were $2-3 each. Milk teas, coffees were $1-5, $5 being a single origin pourover from a luxury mall in a fancy coffee shop. Coffee culture seems pretty strong here so we tried to avoid the popular franchises like Luckin and went for artisanal shops (we did try Chagee and Manner Coffee - their osmanthus latte was a highlight).

One ""complaint"" we had were the public restrooms. While I've heard it has improved significantly in recent years in terms of accessibility and cleanliness, there were still many that had squat toilets, older facilities, and not the most hygienic. Older high speed rail station bathrooms were a must avoid... Trust me. We tried to arrange our itinerary for bathroom breaks in luxury malls and hotel lobbies, which has made the experience far more pleasant. 

Overall, great experience and would definitely revisit the more local spots next time we come back!

Some queries:

1. Should we take up a one of those terminal hotels (yotel/ambassador) and go to sleep by 1 PMish, OR drive into the city and take a hotel there, going to city will take us longer to hit the bed but will reduce commute to the city in the morning
2. Should we plan for a 8 hour trip from 9 AM to 5 PM, and then head back to the airport at 5 PM? Would we be able to navigate traffic, checking, clear security and be at the gate for 8 PM flight?

1nsnl9p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nsnl9p,"Mysterious bites for 2 years, can‚Äôt identify pest","Sometimes individual, and occasionally in lines of 3.  I was finally able to get a photo of one before having to itch it beyond recognition. The bite is shown in photo #1 left of tattoo, with photo #2 being what it looks like after scratching them open and it scabbing. 

I live in a basement apartment in a small apartment building of 4 units. The problem is largely centered in my bedroom. I don‚Äôt hardly ever get bit in any other room. My daughter is here about half the time and her and her room remain unaffected. We also have a 14 year old cat and used to have guinea pigs (the piggies room used to be the room I use now). For the last two years I‚Äôve been getting bit up and feel something crawling on me, primarily at night but not exclusively (if I‚Äôm home and take a mid day nap it can happen then as well). If I don‚Äôt change my sheets right before bed, there is no falling asleep. I have an expensive zip up encasement around my mattress which I just replaced, and no box spring. Just a metal frame with wood planks. 

We haven‚Äôt been able to find any actual bed bug or flea, and we‚Äôre pretty sure whatever it is is microscopic. I even ripped the trim out to steam clean the walls, and nothing. 

For many months now, my cat has been staying treated with bravecto and revolution and she‚Äôs no longer constantly grooming, losing huge tufts of hair, and fussing with her ears like she was. She HAS had ongoing ear problems through this situation though and still has brown/coffee ground wax that we have to clean regularly. The vet has been unable to locate any actual ear mites, though all signs point to mites attacking her. I have an appointment for her again tomorrow, it‚Äôs been several months but I must have had her in there at least 8 times now since this started. I wish that was an exaggeration. She‚Äôs currently losing a little hair around the edge of her ear, and had a patch missing under her armpit that she‚Äôs been hiding. 
We‚Äôve had the exterminator here 4 or 5 times too, and it seems like it helps but not long term.. only days, if that. I‚Äôve tried bombs, sprays, steam cleaning the carpet, shampooing all my carpets, I wash my bedding every few days when I run out of sheets, keep most of my clothing in trash bags after coming out the dryer, I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end. I don‚Äôt date or have people over because I‚Äôm afraid to expose anyone else to this hell. 

It seems like the problem will get slightly better at times then regress back to it being worse. After spending literal thousands at this point between the vet, exterminator, and home remedies I have an appointment with dermatology this week and I‚Äôm going to insist they do a test this time and not try to shuffle me out the door as fast as I came in. I‚Äôm tired of assumptions and guesses. I need an actual skin scrape or whatever to determine the cause. 

From what I‚Äôve read, this is becoming more of a common occurrence for some reason in the United States and I‚Äôll be sure to post any updates whenever I receive news from the doctor.

1nsnjfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1nsnjfw/35f_bloating_change_in_bowel_habit_and_heartburn/,"35F bloating, change in bowel habit, and heartburn","Hi, I'm 35F, 1.55m, 53kg, caucasian.

Medicine list: metformin 500mg dly, myo-inositol+folic acid powder 1 scoop daily, Magnesium+Vit B 1 tab daily. 

Since about 1 year 6 months ago I noticed increased bloating which has now become nearly permanent and a reduction in the frequency of opening bowels. Before I used to have a flat stomach and regular bowel habit. I also suffered from constipation, where the stool was slimy not hard.  It was soft, but seemed difficult to get out.  I used to take Macrogol 4000 to help with opening bowels even though it was not hard.  I also found helpful taking prunes, kiwi, and other natural laxatives to help me go to the toilet. 

In addition to this, 8 months ago I also started having heartburn.  I had to stop coffee completely, and limit breakfast tea to once daily. I took PPIs for about 5 months straight and now the heartburn is better although I still get some if I take even a cup of coffee, alcohol, or spicy food. I used to be on pantoprazole, but now I only take this when needed.

I had blood tests, stool tests, an ultrasound, and a gastroscopy which were all normal. A surgeon also sent me for a motility study where I took a pill with x-ray markers daily for 5 days and an x-ray at the end, and it seemed normal. I seem to have symptoms most of the time which improve if I am overly anxious or just about to do a test, when the symptoms disappear.  For example, my bloating completely disappeared when having the ultrasound, but appeared after. Either I have nothing or I'm just too unlucky. 

Sometimes when I check my tummy when lying down I noticed a swelling or soft mass in the left middle to lower area. It doesn't hurt when I press, but I noticed it when palpating. The ultrasound did not show anything or it was not reported.  I haven't mentioned this to any doctor to be honest.  The surgeon and gastroenterologist I saw were more concerned about the constipation and heartburn respectively, and none checked my tummy. To be fair, the surgeon saw me before I noticed it, and I spoke mostly about the heartburn to the gastroenterologist.

Anyway, adding to this, I am passing through a stressful period in my life.  I have never been this stressed before. I spent many years training for my job only to end up with people who are actively putting spokes  in my wheels, talking behind my back, destroying my reputation, and being horrible people all around. For this reason I am really unhappy with my work, and it's difficult to move because it's a niche area for which I specialised and there is a very limited market for what I do.  I have a lot of resentment because of what could have been had I made different decisions in the past.  Admittedly I never thought I would end up here and that is killing me from inside. So there's that also going on.  

My question is: should I do anything else or just try to address the stress before looking for causes to my symptoms?  Recently I had a small breakthrough of sorts. 

After I did the gastroscopy which showed normal results, I have shifted to actively trying to manage the work-related stress by practicing self reflection and talking good things to myself (I know, but seems to be working a bit).  I have also shifted from taking the myo-inositol from the evening to the morning before food, and that seemed to help me move my bowels a bit.  I started the Magnesium tablets also (since about 2 weeks), and this might have helped I don't know.  Progress is slow but hopefully it will continue.  Anything else I might do?  thanks if you are still reading. ",1,1759063830.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Ethiopians are warm, proud, and generous, and showing respect for local customs will make your experience much smoother and more rewarding.

Here are a few key do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts to help you navigate daily interactions with ease:

# Do‚Äôs ‚úÖ

**1. Greet People Warmly**  
Greetings are very important in Ethiopia. A firm handshake with eye contact and a smile is the norm. Among close friends or family, you might also see shoulder touches or kisses on alternate cheeks. When entering a room, greet everyone individually, starting with the eldest. Taking a moment to ask about someone‚Äôs health or family before diving into conversation shows respect.

**2. Respect Elders and Authority**  
Always stand to greet elders and allow them to speak first. They are usually served or seated first at meals and gatherings. Using polite language and listening attentively go a long way.

**3. Accept Hospitality**  
Ethiopians are famous for their hospitality. If you‚Äôre offered food, drink, or even a place to rest, it‚Äôs polite to accept ‚Äî even a small bite or sip is enough. If you‚Äôre invited to a traditional coffee ceremony, try to stay for at least the first round of coffee, known as *abol*.

**4. Use Your Right Hand**  
Traditionally, the right hand is used for eating, passing objects, and greetings. The left hand is considered unclean. When dining, expect communal eating with injera, and don‚Äôt be surprised if someone feeds you by hand (*gursha*) ‚Äî it‚Äôs a gesture of affection.

**5. Dress Modestly**  
Ethiopia is a conservative country, especially in rural and religious areas. Women should cover shoulders and knees, and everyone should remove shoes before entering Orthodox churches.

# Don‚Äôts ‚ùå

**1. Take Photos or Videos Without Asking**  
Always ask permission before photographing people, especially in rural areas or during religious ceremonies.

**2. Be Too Direct**  
Ethiopian culture values harmony and politeness. If someone says ‚Äúyes,‚Äù it might mean ‚ÄúI hear you‚Äù rather than a firm commitment. Follow up gently instead of showing frustration.

**4. Show Public Displays of Affection**  
Holding hands with friends of the same gender is normal, but kissing or hugging romantic partners in public is frowned upon.

**5. Criticize Religion or Culture**  
Ethiopians are deeply proud of their history and traditions. Avoid making negative remarks about religion or politics.

Ethiopian etiquette is all about respect, patience, and open-mindedness. By following these tips, you‚Äôll build meaningful connections and avoid misunderstandings.

I‚Äôve been working on something I‚Äôm excited to share ‚Äî¬†[CozyIcons](https://www.cozyiconss.com/)¬†üöÄ

It‚Äôs a lightweight tool that lets you generate¬†beautiful 3D isometric icons¬†in the soft 3D isometrics. You just type what you need (‚Äúcoffee cup icon‚Äù, ‚Äúworkspace icon‚Äù, ‚Äúmountain cabin icon‚Äù) and CozyIcons instantly creates a crisp, customizable, 3D isometric icon you can use in your projects.

Why I built it:

* I love clean, cozy design styles.
* Existing icon tools didn‚Äôt quite nail the ‚Äúwarm, isometric‚Äù style I wanted.
* CozyIcons makes it possible to create consistent style icons instantly.

Use cases:

* UI/UX design mockups
* Product landing pages
* Presentation assets
* Branding for apps or services

We met up one day. And agreed we needed to stop talking or put a pause on it because feelings and emotions were getting too deep and it was getting harder to control at home. He told me if we were just dating our spouses things would be different because divorce/money wouldn‚Äôt be tied into anything.

It‚Äôs been about 6 weeks since we talked. We work random days but sometimes we do run into each other. We don‚Äôt talk anymore at work because we don‚Äôt want the rumors. So that part is really hard because it felt like I lost a friend as well as someone that I liked too. I caught him looking at me a lot when he worked last lol. It felt good he was still watching me but everything feels so heavy now. It feels like we broke up and can‚Äôt talk anymore. 

I‚Äôm hoping we can reach back out to each other soon and just talk. I miss him and I miss how things were before emotions got involved. I find myself hurting and thinking about him. Some days I‚Äôm good but then when I see him again I start back over. ",0,1759063221.0,adultery,0,0.5,False

When they wake up, one of them walks up to a still unconscious member of the group, tries to wake him up, and his head falls backwards off of his body, and it's pretty gory.

I think the synopsis of the movie was that one of the group is the killer. iirc, all of them were wearing blue, sci-fi themed outfits, like Star Trek, but I could be wrong about this. ",1,1759063051.0,tipofmytongue,6,1.0,False
1nsn9mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nsn9mh/the_painted_smile/,The Painted Smile,"Hollow Creek wasn‚Äôt much of a town. Just two gas stations, a row of weather-beaten houses, and a school that always smelled faintly of mold. Most people drove through it without even realizing it had a name. But to the kids who lived there, Hollow Creek was home‚Äîa place where summer nights were spent chasing fireflies and daring each other to sneak into the woods after dark.

On a muggy August evening, **Mary Lou Carter** was the last child left outside. Her mother had called her in twice already, but Mary Lou had been distracted by something in the middle of the street.

A balloon.

It wasn‚Äôt tied to anything. It floated low, bobbing lazily in the still air, as if waiting for her. The balloon was red, so shiny it seemed to glow in the twilight.

Mary Lou tilted her head. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you come from?‚Äù she asked in her small sing-song voice.

That‚Äôs when she saw him.

At the end of the street, half-hidden in the shadows, a **clown** stood perfectly still. His costume was old, faded white with streaks of rust-red down the sleeves. His face was painted with a wide smile that stretched almost ear to ear. The painted grin was sloppy, as though smeared on with blood.

In his gloved hand, he held a cluster of balloons that shimmered in every color.

Mary Lou‚Äôs first instinct was to run, but the clown lifted one balloon‚Äîthe red one‚Äîand pointed to her.

‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs for you,‚Äù he said. His voice carried unnaturally, echoing down the street like a whisper inside her head.

The little girl‚Äôs breath caught. For reasons she couldn‚Äôt explain, she felt drawn to it, as though the balloon wasn‚Äôt just rubber and air, but something alive. She reached for it.

By the time Mrs. Carter came out to call her daughter again, Mary Lou was gone. All that remained were her tiny white shoes, sitting neatly in the middle of the road.

And above them, the red balloon drifted higher and higher until it disappeared into the night sky.

By morning, Hollow Creek was buzzing. Word of Mary Lou‚Äôs disappearance spread faster than wildfire, though no one wanted to admit they believed the rumors. Mrs. Carter sat in her kitchen, trembling hands wrapped around a coffee cup, repeating the same words to the police officer at her table:

‚ÄúShe was just there. Right there in the road. And then‚Äîthen she was gone.‚Äù

The officer scribbled something in his notebook, but his eyes betrayed disbelief.

At Hollow Creek Elementary, the kids already had their own story.

‚ÄúMary Lou didn‚Äôt run away,‚Äù whispered **Tommy Reed**, a freckled boy in Ethan Harper‚Äôs class. ‚ÄúShe got taken. By him.‚Äù

‚ÄúBy whom?‚Äù Ethan asked, though he already knew the answer.

Tommy lowered his voice. ‚ÄúThe clown. Grinny. He‚Äôs real.‚Äù

The name hung in the air like poison. Every kid had heard of Grinny, the town‚Äôs boogeyman. A clown with a smile too big, who lived in the woods and lured children away. Parents dismissed it as nonsense. But the children knew better.

That night, Ethan was woken by a tapping at his window. When he pulled back the curtain, his breath caught in his throat.

A yellow balloon floated just outside the glass.

It wasn‚Äôt tied to anything. And faintly‚Äîso faintly‚Äîhe thought he saw a face pressing against the inside of the balloon.

It was smiling. Ethan didn‚Äôt sleep after the balloon at his window. He lay frozen in bed, staring at the faint glow of the streetlamp leaking through his blinds. Every creak of the house sounded like a footstep. Every whisper of wind against the glass felt like breath.

When morning finally came, his eyes were raw, his throat dry. His mother didn‚Äôt notice‚Äîshe was too busy talking about Mary Lou with Mrs. Carter on the phone, her voice hushed but frantic.

On the walk to school, Ethan stuck close to his best friend, Tommy.

‚ÄúYou saw it, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Tommy asked quietly. His eyes darted from side to side as though afraid the grown-ups would hear.

Ethan hesitated. Then he nodded.

‚ÄúMine was red,‚Äù Tommy said. ‚ÄúIt floated by my window last night. I think it‚Ä¶ I think it said my name.‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs stomach knotted. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, said your name?‚Äù

Tommy‚Äôs lips trembled. ‚ÄúLike a whisper. Coming from inside the balloon.‚Äù

Ethan didn‚Äôt reply. He couldn‚Äôt.

That afternoon, on his walk home, Ethan cut across Miller‚Äôs Field‚Äîa shortcut through high grass and cattails. The sun was dipping low, spilling orange across the horizon. The crickets were already beginning their nightly chorus.

That‚Äôs when he saw him.

At the far edge of the ditch, half-submerged in shadow, stood the clown. His faded costume flapped in the breeze, though the air was still. His head was tilted at an unnatural angle, his painted grin shining like a crescent moon.

The clown raised a hand and wagged his fingers slowly, like a parent calling a child closer.

Ethan‚Äôs legs locked. He couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt breathe.

Then, as if melting into the earth itself, the clown sank back into the ditch‚Äîgone, leaving only the tall grass swaying where he had stood.

Ethan ran the rest of the way home without looking back.

That night, he heard laughter outside his window. Not joyful laughter‚Äîsomething broken, hollow, echoing from far away.

And above Hollow Creek, a second balloon floated into the night sky. Two days after Mary Lou vanished, the Carters still had no answers. Police cars crawled the streets, officers knocking on doors, their radios hissing static. But everyone in Hollow Creek knew the truth: the little girl wasn‚Äôt coming back.

And then it happened again.

**Jeremy Hall** was nine years old, a wiry kid with a loudmouth and a knack for mischief. On that Thursday night, he sneaked out of bed after his parents had fallen asleep. He wanted to prove to his friends that he wasn‚Äôt afraid of the stories.

He wanted to see the clown.

With a flashlight in one hand and a baseball bat in the other, Jeremy crept down the quiet street, his sneakers crunching gravel. The night was heavy, pressing down on him, but he forced a grin.

‚ÄúThis is stupid,‚Äù he muttered to himself. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a story.‚Äù

But when he reached the intersection near the old bus stop, his flashlight beam caught something bobbing in the darkness.

A balloon.

This one was blue, glowing faintly under the streetlamp. It hovered waist-high, as if waiting just for him.

Jeremy swallowed hard. ‚ÄúAlright, clown,‚Äù he said, his voice cracking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not scared.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when the music started.

A low, wheezing sound, like an old accordion struggling for air. A playful, broken tune drifted from the woods. Jeremy‚Äôs heart slammed against his ribs.

And then he saw him.

The clown was sitting on the bench at the bus stop, head tilted back, his painted grin gleaming in the dark. In his hands, he cradled a cracked accordion, pulling out its sour notes.

Jeremy raised his bat. ‚ÄúStay away from me!‚Äù

The clown only chuckled. It was a sound like wind rattling through bones. He held out the blue balloon and whispered, though his lips never moved:

‚ÄúTake it, Jeremy. It‚Äôs yours.‚Äù

The boy‚Äôs grip on the bat weakened. Against his will, his hand stretched forward.

The next morning, all they found was Jeremy‚Äôs flashlight lying in the road, still on, its beam shining weakly into the trees.

And floating above Hollow Creek was a second balloon, drifting higher and higher until it was swallowed by the clouds. Ethan didn‚Äôt sleep that night. Not after Jeremy vanished. Not after seeing the balloon drift higher than the rooftops, glowing like a pale, sinister star. He knew the adults wouldn‚Äôt do anything. They were too busy blaming the woods, blaming each other, blaming ‚Äúbad luck.‚Äù

But Ethan knew better.

The next day at school, he cornered Tommy behind the gym.

‚ÄúI saw him again,‚Äù Ethan whispered, his eyes scanning the hall for teachers. ‚ÄúThe clown. In the ditch. He‚Äôs real.‚Äù

Tommy‚Äôs eyes went wide. ‚ÄúI told you! He‚Äôs real! You saw the balloon, right? The one at your window?‚Äù

Ethan nodded. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt wait for the adults. They‚Äôll just‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äîthey‚Äôll just pretend it didn‚Äôt happen,‚Äù Tommy finished.

A silence fell between them. Other kids were walking past, laughing, unaware of the danger creeping through Hollow Creek. But Ethan and Tommy felt it like a shadow stretching across the classroom floor.

‚ÄúWe have to do something,‚Äù Ethan said finally. ‚ÄúWe have to stop him. Or at least figure out what he is.‚Äù

Tommy hesitated. ‚ÄúWhat if he‚Ä¶ takes us?‚Äù

Ethan swallowed hard. ‚ÄúThen we die trying. But if we don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ more kids are going to disappear.‚Äù

They shook hands, sealing a silent promise. The **pact** had been formed.

That night, they sneaked out to meet two other classmates who had also seen the clown: **Lila Martinez**, who had nearly been trapped by a balloon on the playground, and **Simon Brooks**, who swore he saw the glowing eyes of the clown watching him from the woods.

Together, they called themselves something whispered only in the dark: **The Hollow Creek Watchers**.

By the time they left the meeting place, a cool wind carried a faint giggle across the rooftops, and somewhere above, a balloon floated slowly, silently, its glowing colors marking the clown‚Äôs domain.

The children knew the game had begun. And they knew the clown was already one step ahead. Ethan, Tommy, Lila, and Simon met every day after school, always careful to avoid teachers, parents, and anyone else who might ask questions. They shared what they‚Äôd seen, piecing together a horrifying picture.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a pattern,‚Äù Simon said one afternoon, crouched behind the chain-link fence near the playground. ‚ÄúThe clown only comes out at night, and it‚Äôs always after kids are alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the balloons,‚Äù Lila added, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúThey‚Ä¶ they whisper. Not like words. Names. My name. Jeremy‚Äôs name. I think‚Ä¶ I think the balloon is how he finds them.‚Äù

Ethan nodded grimly. ‚ÄúThen the adults can‚Äôt stop him. We‚Äôre the only ones who see it.‚Äù

Their first step was to collect evidence. Tommy had brought a notebook. They drew maps of Hollow Creek, marking where each child had vanished. Red dots for Mary Lou and Jeremy. Blue dots for sightings of the clown or strange balloons. By the end of the first week, the map looked like a constellation of terror stretching across the town.

‚ÄúLook here,‚Äù Ethan said, pointing to the woods behind Miller‚Äôs Field. ‚ÄúBoth Mary Lou and Jeremy disappeared near here. And I saw the clown in the ditch along this path. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ this whole area is his hunting ground.‚Äù

Simon shivered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like he knows the town better than we do. Like he‚Äôs always been here.‚Äù

The kids began gathering small items: flashlights, rope, even a few cameras they‚Äôd smuggled from home. They weren‚Äôt planning to fight the clown yet‚Äîthey were planning to **observe**, to learn how he worked before anyone else got hurt.

But even as they made notes and drew careful diagrams, Ethan couldn‚Äôt shake one thought:

The clown wasn‚Äôt just hunting. He was **choosing**. And every time a balloon appeared in the sky, a piece of a child‚Äôs soul was already gone.

That night, as the wind whispered through the trees and crickets sang their mournful chorus, Ethan lay awake staring at the ceiling. Somewhere outside, a balloon floated past his window, glowing faintly. And somewhere behind it, a grin too wide to be human waited.

The investigation had begun. But neither Ethan nor the Watchers realized‚Äîthey were already part of the game. Ethan, Tommy, Lila, and Simon had spent hours after school drawing maps and taking notes. But notes and maps weren‚Äôt enough‚Äîthey needed proof. They needed something that would show the adults that the clown was real.

So that night, armed with flashlights, Ethan led the Watchers to the edge of Miller‚Äôs Field. The air was thick and still, the only sound the whisper of grass underfoot.

‚ÄúKeep your voices down,‚Äù Ethan said. ‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs here, we don‚Äôt want him to see us‚Ä¶ not yet.‚Äù

They huddled together, eyes scanning the horizon. And then, above the trees, a faint glow appeared.

A balloon.

Blue. Slowly drifting closer. Ethan‚Äôs stomach twisted as he noticed something terrifying: inside the latex, he could see‚Ä¶ a face. Not just a shadow, but a small, pale face pressed against the rubber, eyes wide and glassy.

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs Jeremy,‚Äù Simon whispered, voice trembling.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lila said, shaking her head. ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ethan shined his flashlight directly on the balloon. The face inside recoiled from the light, twisting, eyes screaming, but silent. A high-pitched wail echoed inside their minds, not through their ears.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Ethan said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs keeping them in there. The balloons‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre cages.‚Äù

The balloon floated higher, then began drifting toward the woods. The Watchers froze, hearts hammering. In the glow of the streetlamp behind them, they could see a figure standing at the tree line: **the clown**, his grin impossibly wide, holding another cluster of glowing balloons.

Ethan swallowed. ‚ÄúWe need to follow him,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to know where he‚Äôs taking them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Tommy said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll see us! We‚Äôll‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care!‚Äù Ethan snapped. ‚ÄúWe have to know what he is. We have to save them!‚Äù

The others hesitated, then nodded. Together, the Watchers crept after the clown, keeping low and silent. The figure moved unnaturally fast, gliding rather than walking, the balloons trailing behind like captured stars.

And then, without warning, the clown vanished. Just like that‚Äîinto the mist rising from the ditch. Only the balloons remained, floating eerily in the clearing.

The children stared at them, frozen with terror. Inside each one, faces twisted in fear, mouths open in silent screams.

Lila whispered, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs taking their souls. That‚Äôs why they never come back.‚Äù

Ethan clenched his fists. ‚ÄúThen we have to stop him. We can‚Äôt let anyone else disappear.‚Äù

Above them, the balloons drifted higher and higher, silent witnesses to the night, and somewhere in the darkness, the faint sound of broken laughter echoed, promising that the game had only just begun. The next day, the Watchers met in Ethan‚Äôs garage. Maps and sketches of the town were spread across the dusty workbench, scattered with flashlights, rope, and a small pair of binoculars.

‚ÄúWe have to intercept a balloon tonight,‚Äù Ethan said, voice tight. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just follow him anymore. We need proof. And‚Ä¶ maybe we can save one of the kids.‚Äù

Tommy‚Äôs hands shook as he traced a red dot on the map. ‚ÄúMary Lou. Jeremy. They were taken near the ditch and the playground. That‚Äôs all we know.‚Äù

Lila pointed at the sketch of the woods. ‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs taking the balloons there‚Ä¶ maybe we can trap it before it gets too far. But‚Ä¶ we need a plan.‚Äù

Simon swallowed. ‚ÄúWhat if he sees us? What if he‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Ethan interrupted. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt think like that. We have to act. Tonight we wait near the field, and when a balloon appears, we try to intercept it.‚Äù

Night fell like a black curtain over Hollow Creek. The air was heavy, thick with the smell of wet grass and the faint scent of something‚Ä¶ metallic. The four of them crouched in Miller‚Äôs Field, flashlights off, eyes straining against the darkness.

Hours passed. Crickets chirped. The wind whispered. And then‚Äîa faint glow in the distance.

A balloon. Blue. Hovering low, just above the tall grass. Inside‚Ä¶ a face pressed against the latex. Jeremy‚Äôs face.

Ethan motioned to the others. ‚ÄúNow. Move.‚Äù

They crept closer, hearts pounding. Tommy stretched out a hand, ready to grab the balloon.

Suddenly, the air grew colder, heavier. A low, wheezing sound filled the field, like an accordion being dragged across gravel. The balloon shook violently.

From the tree line, a figure emerged: **Grinny**, his grin impossibly wide, holding several more glowing balloons. His eyes were black pits, hollow and infinite.

‚ÄúLooking for your friends?‚Äù the clown hissed, his voice twisting the night air into something that felt alive.

The Watchers froze. Ethan lunged forward, grabbing the balloon‚Äîbut it slipped through his fingers, as if the air itself had rejected his touch.

Grinny laughed, a sound like metal scraping bone. The balloons around him swirled, floating higher, forming a ring of glowing faces. The children could see the trapped kids inside, mouths moving as if screaming‚Äîbut no sound came out.

Ethan staggered backward. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we can‚Äôt fight him!‚Äù

Tommy whispered, shaking, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs not human. He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ something else.‚Äù

The clown tilted his head. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have come.‚Äù

And just like that, the balloons exploded into the sky, releasing a deafening chorus of screams and vanishing into the darkness. The Watchers fell to the ground, gasping, hearts racing.

Ethan looked up at the empty sky. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we weren‚Äôt ready,‚Äù he said.

Lila‚Äôs voice was trembling. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs stronger than we thought. He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ everywhere.‚Äù

Simon swallowed hard. ‚ÄúThen what do we do?‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs jaw tightened. ‚ÄúWe learn. We plan. And next time‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre not going to fail.‚Äù

The day after their first failed attempt, the Watchers gathered in Ethan‚Äôs garage once again. Their notebooks were full of sketches, maps, and frantic observations‚Äîbut none of it explained what they had seen the night before.

‚ÄúWe have to understand him,‚Äù Ethan said, voice tight. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt know what he is‚Ä¶ we can‚Äôt stop him.‚Äù

Lila nodded, her hands trembling. ‚ÄúMaybe the town knows something. Old newspapers‚Ä¶ history books‚Ä¶ anything.‚Äù

They spent the afternoon combing through Hollow Creek‚Äôs small library. Dusty archives, brittle newspapers, and faded photographs filled the shelves. Hours passed, and nothing jumped out‚Äîuntil Simon stumbled across a thin, leather-bound journal tucked behind the biographies.

‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶ look at this,‚Äù he whispered.

The journal belonged to a man named **Edwin Holloway**, a resident from over a century ago. His entries were strange, erratic, and filled with warnings about a ‚Äúsmiling demon‚Äù that roamed the woods.

Ethan felt a chill run down his spine. ‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ eats them?‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Tommy said, voice shaking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just taking them. He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ devouring their souls.‚Äù

Lila‚Äôs hands flew to her mouth. ‚ÄúNo wonder‚Ä¶ the balloons. They‚Äôre not cages. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ containers. It stores the souls before‚Ä¶ before it consumes them.‚Äù

Simon shuddered. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why no one comes back. That‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ they never speak again.‚Äù

Ethan clenched his fists. ‚ÄúThen we have to stop him. If we don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ everyone else‚Äîevery kid in Hollow Creek‚Äîis next.‚Äù

They spent the rest of the day reading the journal. Other entries mentioned strange sightings: lights in the woods, eerie music, balloons floating without wind, and children disappearing in pairs or clusters. The more they read, the more Ethan realized that **this had been happening for generations**. Hollow Creek had always been prey.

And now, Grinny had returned.

That night, as the sun dipped below the horizon, the Watchers huddled in Ethan‚Äôs garage, each clutching a flashlight. The knowledge weighed on them like a stone in the chest.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just fighting a clown,‚Äù Ethan said, voice trembling but firm. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fighting a predator that feeds on our very souls. And if we fail‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused, staring at the shadows in the corner. ‚ÄúThen Hollow Creek will belong to him.‚Äù

Outside, a balloon drifted lazily past the window, its glow faint but unmistakable. Inside, a pale face pressed against the rubber, eyes wide, mouth open in a silent scream.

Ethan swallowed hard. ‚ÄúWe have to learn everything we can. Tomorrow‚Ä¶ we go back into the woods. ""The air in Hollow Creek hung thick with mist as night fell. Ethan, Tommy, Lila, and Simon huddled at the edge of the woods behind Miller‚Äôs Field, flashlights cutting weak beams through the darkness. Each of them carried something sharp: knives, a hammer, even a length of chain. They weren‚Äôt sure what they could do, but they weren‚Äôt leaving another child behind.

‚ÄúWe end this tonight,‚Äù Ethan whispered, gripping his flashlight like a lifeline. ‚ÄúNo more hiding, no more waiting. We find him, and we put an end to‚Ä¶ all of this.‚Äù

The others nodded silently, the weight of fear and determination pressing down on them.

As they stepped into the trees, the mist thickened. The forest seemed alive, the branches twisting and groaning as if warning them to turn back. Then came the faint sound of music‚Äîlow, wheezing notes from an accordion, warped and broken.

‚ÄúStay close,‚Äù Ethan ordered.

The glow appeared first: a cluster of balloons, red, blue, yellow, floating midair. Inside each one, faint faces twisted in silent screams. Mary Lou. Jeremy. Others the kids had never met but whose fear they could feel through the mist.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs here,‚Äù Lila whispered.

From the shadows, Grinny stepped forward. His grin stretched impossibly wide, eyes like black pits that seemed to swallow the moonlight. Around him, more balloons floated, forming a glowing wall of imprisoned souls.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have come,‚Äù the clown hissed. His voice echoed unnaturally, stretching across the trees. ‚ÄúI play with children who wander‚Ä¶ children who *want* to play.‚Äù

Ethan swallowed his fear. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ending this,‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not letting you hurt anyone else!‚Äù

Grinny laughed. It was a sound that clawed at their minds, each note twisting like ice around their hearts. He raised his arms, and the balloons surged forward, swirling like a storm.

The Watchers held their ground. Tommy swung a chain, trying to break one balloon, but it passed through the rubber as if it weren‚Äôt there. Simon swung his hammer, Lila her knife‚Äînothing worked.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs too strong,‚Äù Lila cried, backing away. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we learn,‚Äù Ethan said, stepping forward. ‚ÄúWe find a way. And we‚Äôll finish him, no matter what.‚Äù

The clown tilted his head. ‚ÄúBrave‚Ä¶ but foolish. Come closer, and I will *taste* your souls too.‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs chest burned with defiance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stop you, Grinny. Even if it‚Äôs the last thing we do.‚Äù

The balloons hovered, glowing like captured stars, and the forest seemed to shrink around them. The Watchers realized something terrifying: **Grinny‚Äôs power was only growing**, feeding off their fear, taunting them. But in that moment, amid the terror, a resolve took root.

They would stop him. They would fight. And they would save Hollow Creek‚Äîor die trying.

The first real battle against the clown had begun.The Watchers crept closer to the tattered circus tent, hearts hammering like drumbeats in the silent woods. Each balloon above them pulsed faintly, as if alive, and inside each, faces twisted in silent screams‚Äîchildren, adults, maybe even strangers long forgotten.

Grinny sat at the center, humming that broken, rusted tune, his grin impossibly wide. Then he raised his head, eyes glowing black as oil, and his laughter filled the clearing. It wasn‚Äôt just a laugh‚Äîit was a sound that reached into their bones, shaking their courage and pulling at their very minds.

Ethan stepped forward, gripping Tommy‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not leaving,‚Äù he whispered.

The clown tilted his head, voice dripping with malice. ‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ you finally see. You finally understand. I am not merely a clown, nor merely a predator. I am‚Ä¶ everything your fear can imagine. I feed on it. I devour joy, innocence, and life itself. Every scream, every tear, every frightened heartbeat‚Ä¶ it sustains me.‚Äù

The Watchers froze.

‚ÄúI am older than your town. Older than your world. I have eaten forests, villages, cities‚Ä¶ civilizations. And I feast on more than flesh‚ÄîI feast on souls. Children are my delicacy, laughter my wine. Every balloon you see,‚Äù he gestured toward the glowing clusters, ‚Äúholds the essence of the living‚Ä¶ waiting for me to consume.‚Äù

Lila‚Äôs hands flew to her mouth. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not human,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Grinny said, rising to his feet. His form stretched impossibly tall, bones cracking like old wood, his grin widening into something monstrous. ‚ÄúI am the hunger that grows in darkness. I am the shadow behind every smile. I am fear itself given teeth.‚Äù

Simon stumbled backward. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we can‚Äôt stop him. He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs not real!‚Äù

Ethan squared his shoulders. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs real enough. And if we don‚Äôt stop him‚Ä¶ he‚Äôll keep eating Hollow Creek‚Äîand then‚Ä¶ the world.‚Äù

The clown laughed again, a sound that split the night. The balloons swirled, faces pressing against the latex, writhing, screaming silently. Grinny stepped closer, towering over the children.

‚ÄúDo you think your courage will save you?‚Äù he hissed. ‚ÄúDo you think small, frightened humans can resist the hunger of eternity?‚Äù

Ethan gritted his teeth. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a choice. We fight. Or everyone dies.‚Äù

Grinny‚Äôs grin stretched impossibly wide. ‚ÄúThen let the feast begin.‚Äù

Above the clearing, the balloons pulsed brighter, and the forest seemed to shiver with anticipation. The Watchers realized for the first time that **Grinny was not just a monster‚Äîthey were standing against a force older than time, a demon that could devour the world itself.**

And for the first time, fear seeped into their hearts‚Äîbut so did determination.

They would fight.

Even if it meant facing the impossible.

# 

The next morning, the Watchers returned to Hollow Creek‚Äôs library, determined to find any clue that could help them fight Grinny. Dust swirled around them as they scoured century-old books, fragile newspapers, and forgotten journals.

Hours passed. Just as hope began to fade, Simon stumbled across a leather-bound tome hidden behind a row of encyclopedias. Its pages were brittle, filled with strange symbols and handwritten instructions in faded ink.

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ this might be it,‚Äù Simon whispered.

Ethan leaned over, eyes scanning the page. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a ritual,‚Äù Lila said, voice trembling. ‚ÄúA‚Ä¶ sealing ritual. It says here that if a creature like Grinny exists, it can be trapped‚Äîforever‚Äîif the ritual is performed exactly right.‚Äù

Tommy read aloud the instructions, trembling:

>

Ethan clenched his fists. ‚ÄúWe can do this. We have to. This is our chance to end him once and for all.‚Äù

Simon hesitated. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ the blood of the brave? Lanterns of fear? Words of the lost? What if it doesn‚Äôt work? What if it‚Ä¶ kills us instead?‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs gaze hardened. ‚ÄúThen we die knowing we tried. But if it does work‚Ä¶ no more balloons. No more children disappearing. No more Hollow Creek falling into his hands.‚Äù

Lila swallowed, nodding. ‚ÄúThen we prepare. We gather everything we need, and we face him‚Äîtogether.‚Äù

The Watchers spent the rest of the day gathering materials. Lanterns were made from old jars, etched with symbols copied from the book. Ropes, chalk, and candles were prepared. They practiced the words of the lost, whispering the names of children Grinny had already taken.

As night fell, the forest felt heavier, almost alive. Somewhere above, balloons floated silently, watching. Grinny‚Äôs laughter echoed faintly in the distance, a cruel reminder that he knew they were planning something.

Ethan took a deep breath. ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Ä¶ we end this.‚Äù

Tommy shivered. ‚ÄúForever?‚Äù

Ethan nodded. ‚ÄúForever.‚Äù

Above Hollow Creek, the balloons glimmered, their pale faces pressed against the latex, and for the first time, the Watchers realized that **the final battle would test not just their courage‚Äîbut their very souls.**Night had fallen over Hollow Creek, and the forest beyond Miller‚Äôs Field was thick with shadows. The Watchers crept through the underbrush, carrying their carefully prepared materials. Lanterns etched with strange symbols swung in Ethan‚Äôs hands, candles and chalk tucked into backpacks.

‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù Ethan whispered. ‚ÄúNo turning back.‚Äù

The clearing appeared as they had seen before, balloons glowing faintly above, some drifting lazily, others forming clusters that looked almost alive. And at the center, Grinny waited.

His grin stretched impossibly wide, eyes black as pits. The balloons around him pulsed with faint, eerie light. The broken accordion tune began again, low and haunting.

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ the brave ones,‚Äù Grinny hissed. ‚ÄúCome to play your last game?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ending this,‚Äù Ethan said, voice steady despite the fear clawing at his chest. ‚ÄúTonight, you‚Äôre trapped. Forever.‚Äù

Grinny laughed, a sound that made the air quiver. ‚ÄúBold words. Let us see if you survive them.‚Äù

Ethan dropped the lanterns into position, tracing the circle of binding with chalk as Tommy helped place the candles. Lila whispered the words of the lost, reciting the names of children Grinny had taken. Simon held the rope that would bind the demon, hands shaking as he kept the circle tight.

Grinny moved closer, each step stretching the shadows, twisting the light. ‚ÄúYou think a circle of chalk, a few jars, and whispered words can bind me? I am fear. I am hunger. I am eternity!‚Äù

The balloons around him pulsed violently. Faces pressed against the rubber, mouths opening in silent screams. Ethan felt a wave of terror wash over him‚Äîbut he forced himself to focus.

‚ÄúKeep going,‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost there!‚Äù

As they finished the circle and began chanting the final words, the forest seemed to shift. Shadows stretched unnaturally, wind howled through the trees, and the lanterns flared, bright and terrible. Grinny screamed‚Äîa sound that split the night, echoing through the hearts of all four children.

The ground trembled. The balloons shrieked in silence, faces twisting. The Watchers held their positions, chanting the final syllables of the ritual, their voices shaking but growing stronger together.

For the first time, Grinny faltered. His towering form wavered, his grin twitching. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ this cannot be‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ am‚Ä¶ eternal‚Ä¶‚Äù

The lanterns flared brighter, encasing him in a cage of light. The balloons quivered, their glow fading as Grinny let out one final, ear-splitting scream. Then, with a sound like glass shattering across eternity, he **vanished**.

The forest fell silent. The balloons dropped to the ground, lifeless. The faces pressed against them were gone. Hollow Creek, for the first time in decades, felt‚Ä¶ empty. But safe.

Ethan collapsed, shaking. ‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ it worked.‚Äù

Lila knelt beside him, whispering, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone‚Ä¶ forever.‚Äù

Tommy and Simon just stared, still trembling, but relief washing over them. Together, they had faced the impossible. Together, they had stopped the world-eating demon clown.

I'm not even someone who strictly divides perfumes into seasons, always thought it was more of a marketing thing.

But this turning weather made me see Amber Kiso in a whole new light.

I'm extremely (to my own demise) picky about fragrances. Out of 100 samples I will dislike 95, like 3, love 2, and mayyybe, just maybe out of those 2 I'll love 1 enough to consider getting a small decant to try wearing it. 

This year I went through maybe 50 new samples and the only one I liked was Amber Kiso, but I never considered it to be 'my' scent. But this morning I wore it while walking my dog in a park and it just made me fall in love with it. It just works for this weather sooo well. I am now considering a full bottle, or at least a bigger decant, and wear it as my signature this fall. And maybe take it to my upcoming trip to Japan this autumn and make it my Japan memory fragrance 

So since today I got curious about this scent, I wanted to read about it more online and kept seeing people saying it smells like band-aids, or a hospital? Is this true? Actually, at this moment I can't 'picture' how band-aids or the hospital smells like (am I too heathy?lol), but I have no idea how could Amber Kiso have anything to do with it. Would love other people's opinion on this - very curious!!

To  me it's soooo rich, syrupy, thick, calming. I think hospitals would smell clean and sterile, but this smells cozy, warm, lived in, it smells like patina if that makes sense. It's not cozy in a 'wearing cute sweater and drinking hot chocolate with apple pie while it's snowing outside' way. It's more like cozy in a 'walking through a damp forest, but you're wearing warm layers and a waxed cotton jacket and really reliable and comfortable shoes, and you have a thermos full of hot black coffee' way. It's rugged!  Or like, when you're working outside, doing something physically tiring on a brisk day. Then come back inside for a warm meal. It's like the warmth and the food is more deserved lmao, so it makes it extra cozy and comforting. 

I haven't been to a Japanese temple, so it doesn't bring me those associations necessarily, but I can imagine it, because it smells serene, refined, a bit monastic, the opposite of extravagant and opulent and flashy. It's definitely contemplative, but it's NOT cold or ascetic.  It would make sense that it's monastic in a warm wooden Japanese temple way, instead of cold dark stone Catholic monastery way. The incense in this fragrance is also not the Catholic church frankincense, but definitely sandalwood/agarwood based Japanese incense. 

It also has animalic, resinous, sticky side. The leather is very prominent, and it's dark and thick and heavy. 

It also has a sweetness but not - absolutely not - sugary or edible in any way, it's more how some inedible things have a slight smooth sweetness to their smell. 

Actually it smells like some sort of sacred attar. I think I would even prefer to have it in a perfume oil form, because it would correspond more to the image in my mind that this fragrance evokes.

I don't get any green notes, the cypress, hinoki, treemoss. Not even patchouli. To me it's primarily dark woods with leather and some sticky sweet-ish resins. 

  
Totally unrelated, but - I don't know if it's just me, but I am always very aware that any fragrance I try or wear, I'll never get the full picture how it smells on me, it's like not being able to see your own ears. 

I would be so so curious to meet someone who wears it too, because I'd love to see how it smells as a waft in the air when someone is passing by. I have this wish with all my beloved fragrances lol.  

I really think the fragrance is only complete when it's mixed with the surrounding air and the scent of the wearer (and of course we cant smell this ourselves) ",6,1759062572.0,fragrance,2,1.0,False

He was genuinely surprised. 

And here‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù:

I grew up in a Methodist house with my maternal grandmother being a Methodist pastor. I spent a lot of time behind the scenes listening and observing. In the time I was ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in the church I witnessed two separate pastors cheat on their wives. Thou shall not commit adultery? What? Hypocrisy. 

I worked/work at a restaurant and have for many years. As a host I saw the most mean, evil and nasty people dressed in their ‚ÄúSunday Best‚Äù coming in, belittling people left and right. It‚Äôs ok‚Ä¶I just came from church and repented my sins‚Ä¶I‚Äôm good to be a horrible person right? Hypocrisy. 

I‚Äôve heard and seen the most disgusting and horrific things from deemed ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù. 

I asked him‚Ä¶if ‚Äúgod‚Äù is the only ‚Äúgod‚Äù‚Ä¶then why are there so many other religions? Wouldn‚Äôt he create one religion? And thou shall not worship (fake) idols? Then what is your ‚Äúgod‚Äù besides an idol? 

There are so many bad things happening in the world and have been happening since the beginning that he just lets it happen? 

Yes, there should be conflict. Yes there should be disagreement. But to kill or harm a person because of it is just wild to me. But then justice is served in time. Maybe not by a justice system, but by a deep guilt that lives on, or some thing ‚Äúbad‚Äù happens. Not at the direct hands of anyone else but cause and effect. 

I believe you get back what you put on out. A genuine person receives everything they need in time. And when they should receive it. You can‚Äôt rush it by doing everything ‚Äúextra‚Äù. But you shouldn‚Äôt be doing things just to increase your ‚Äúchances‚Äù. Do all the little things. A smile. A good morning. A coffee for a friend. A ‚Äúhey‚Ä¶you doing ok?‚Äù The things that make you genuinely feel good. You‚Äôre the one that can change someone else‚Äôs outlook on life or their world with just one little gesture of kindness. 

We got more into the conversation of evolution as well. There‚Äôs so much more to that‚Ä¶

At no point did I say: ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúgod‚Äù but instead I told them‚Ä¶believe what you feel is right. Believe in the things that make a positive impact on your life and your soul and heart. 

I have researched many religions and have found bits and pieces of information and insights and have pieced together my own ‚Äúbeliefs‚Äù. 

This co worker is young, and I live in a predominantly ‚Äúchristian‚Äù part of the US. He told me his dad asked‚Ä¶so he‚Äôs interested. But at no point should anyone tell him he‚Äôs wrong for questioning something that is forced upon many people of all ages. Again with the hypocrisy‚Ä¶don‚Äôt believe‚Ä¶go to üëπ. 

I think the reason he was so surprised is that I‚Äôm sure he genuinely believed I was a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù because I‚Äôm the one at work, lifting people up, supporting them, making sure their  no job is easier, making sure no one gets hurt. Not ‚Äútooting‚Äù my own horn, but I‚Äôm been recognized as the people who everyone can go to and I‚Äôm not frazzled or stressed out. I roll with the punches. I don‚Äôt get mad about something I can‚Äôt control. Sometimes things happen and you pivot and keep going.

It's coming up to two years since I began dieting and exercising (more), having lost >!~8 stone!< in that time. I'm now at a place where I'm maintaining >!(160-165 lbs at 6'1"")!< and am looking to keep it that way.

How this relates to the potential of a disordered relationship with food is my approach to restriction - I eat mostly the same sort of thing every day/week, partly for ease and partly because the calories are easy to track. I don't do cheat meals and avoid pretty much every conventionally unhealthy food aside from protein bars and having sugar in coffee/tea.

It's gotten to a point where anything outside of that feels almost like a threat to my health, like any cheat item or meal will automatically stick pounds back on to me, and don't get me wrong, I do enjoy eating what I do, but it takes the fun out of a fair amount of opportunities to branch out.

I'd absolutely love to have a pizza, burger and chips, fried foods, all the sort of thing I used to enjoy when I wasn't so conscious of what I was eating, but there's just something in me that feels like I can't do it. Realistically, I know the impact would be minimal if not impossible, because like I say I track calories like a hawk and exercise enough to negate any over-indulgence.

So my question is, how can I help myself to loosen things up a bit? Even to just allow myself a once-a-month or bi-weekly cheat meal without feeling like I have to do a load of HIIT on my rest days to discount it. The closest list of symptoms to a recognised disorder that I'm aware of is Orthorexia, but I'm not always keen to put a label on something without properly researching.

Have a sweetener to make it sweet, would recommend stevia or monk fruit based one. they are quite affordable.

For the last 3 days my coffee has had a savory or brothy smell. It's hard to detect in the coffee itself (but definitely there are a little bit ) and I don't notice it affecting the flavor although I'm sure it has to be somewhat. But when the cup is empty and sitting next to me it becomes very strong. It reminds me of soy sauce or some kind of broth; when I first started smelling it I didn't know it was my coffee cup and I thought somebody was cooking some Chinese food nearby or something in my kitchen was smelling strong. It's not an unpleasant smell but I don't want it associated with my coffee.
 
I have been brewing this setup for over a year and have never encountered this before. Usually if a zero water filter goes bad it smells like a fish tank, but even still, I eliminated that as a variable.
 
I have tried everything I can think of to isolate it. I use a zero water pitcher and Lotus drops to remineralize. I have washed my zero water pitcher and changed the filter. I have also tried brewing without sodium or potassium since I read that too much can cause this issue even though I'm using the ""light and bright"" recipe which is a very low TDS recipe. I don't smell it in the water itself or in the kettle when it's empty.

I have also smelled this on three different coffees from two different roasters (Perc and S&W), including a decaf. I have smelled it with different Brewers and different grinders as well. I also smell it in ceramic as well as glass mugs, even on the spoon after I stir my brew, and I have cleaned my kettle with vinegar to get all of the mineral deposits out of it. It looks and smells new.

My next move is to try brewing with tap water but I really don't think the Zero pitcher or the Lotus drops are the culprit. Does anybody else have any ideas or have experiences before? It crossed my mind that I might simply be picking up on a smell that is inherent and coffees and for some reason it's coming out strong now, but I'm not usually a particularly skilled or practiced taster. My taste and smell otherwise seem to be unaffected.",1,1759062140.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1nsmy9e,https://i.redd.it/lwlfslbhewrf1.jpeg,Benzene of Earth,"When I look back in time, my JEE preparation days were probably the worst days of my life. I just didn‚Äôt enjoy studying many topics, except just two. One was Coordinate Geometry, and the other was Organic Chemistry.

But everyone around me absolutely hated organic chemistry. You had to remember a lot of shapes and stuff to go through it successfully. But organic chemistry had one thing ‚Äì Benzene. And I just loved Benzene. For reasons I don‚Äôt know exactly, but maybe it was because its structure looked so symmetrical and elegant. Looking at Benzene‚Äôs perfect hexagon and simplicity made it sacred for me. Its shape, weirdly, gave me some hope that even though I was bad at math and physics, I can at least do well in organic chemistry.

Discovery of Benzene‚Äôs structure was actually a turning point in organic chemistry itself. Its simplicity gave chemists a unifying concept that explained hundreds of molecules. Understanding benzene was like deciphering a code of nature. It turned confusion into clarity. Brought order under apparent chaos of the universe. It was as if before Benzene, nature was hiding in plain sight.

But one and a half years ago, something amazing happened. A friend, and the smartest person (only in one way) I know, showed me this picture of Saturn. There‚Äôs actually a hexagon shape on Saturn‚Äôs pole. Much like Benzene.

That picture blew my mind. How can there be Benzene anywhere else than in bulky, boring organic chemistry books. I don‚Äôt care what natural phenomenon makes this possible for Saturn‚Äôs atmosphere to form this structure, I left science long back. But to see Benzene structure killing it on a different and the most beautiful planet (the rings, yeah) was beautiful. Benzene has come so far. I almost felt proud.

That was the last time I thought of Benzene. Until last night.

Few days back, something terrible happened to me. I‚Äôve been living in a nice, decent apartment in Ahmedabad, with two other guys, since I started working here in April. They have been living here since last September.

Now I don‚Äôt the whole story on how they got this flat. All I know is one of them is married (and also Gujarati), luckily got some deal with the landlady saying his wife and family will be staying here too. His wife has stayed here for a total of 3 days since I moved in April. She actually works in a different city so there was no way someone in the society wouldn‚Äôt eventually notice three dudes living together in a society which only allows families. In fact, from my limited experience of three days of searching for a flat, I can safely say no good society in Ahmedabad accepts bachelors.

But coming to my incidence, the reason people noticed we were bachelors was not that the wife of my flatmate was not staying here. The reason was me.

A tall, old guy, who I had never met before, saw me in the lift, and began questioning me like he‚Äôs from the police. In forty seconds of that lift journey, he practically asked me everything about me. I think he mistook me for a Muslim, which is a common thing I‚Äôve seen people assume about me all my life. If you don‚Äôt know me, and saw me for the first time somewhere in one of the rare instances when I leave my room, you‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúYeah, this guy is probably Muslim‚Äù. Which is weird. I don‚Äôt wear anything that would suggest I‚Äôm Muslim. No cap, no beard (at least not a proper one).

And I‚Äôve been called a Kashmiri by many people since school, so it was obvious people in Ahmedabad would think so too. Probably because my skin is too fair, and I‚Äôm tall. Or my fingers and nails are too long, I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs probably because I speak too little, and have this weird bitchy face and aura, that can make anyone think I‚Äôm hiding something. Our country is anyway essentially a trust less society. I know many who don‚Äôt even trust their family, so it‚Äôs obvious any normal, average person won‚Äôt trust a guy who seemingly looks like he‚Äôs hiding something in the back of his mind.

But that interaction in the lift left something in me. I felt sad for some time, of the way that guy spoke to me. Next day, that guy came to our flat, and began his shouting. I was not at home that time (which was a good thing), and my married flatmate, who‚Äôs also a sales guy, was there. He‚Äôs the only one amongst us three who could put a decent face while explaining our bullshit story. But even if you were the greatest salesperson in the world, you can‚Äôt sell a shitty story to a guy who‚Äôs in rage and blinded by anger.

Which is fair. To be honest, if I were a family man, living in a family society, I wouldn‚Äôt want bachelors living nearby me too. If I had to face that old society guy, I would have packed my bags even before the first words came out of his mouth. Not because I don‚Äôt like confrontation or negotiation. But because I never enter a fight I know I‚Äôm not going to win. I‚Äôm a dawg. I only play to win.

Anyway, he gave us time till first of October to find a new home. Six days. Of which three are gone already, and I am wasting this Sunday morning writing this. So things are not good. Three days of home searching were enough for me to realize we‚Äôre doomed. All three of us have tried our best, and would now probably need to go stay somewhere far from the city, far from our offices.

Yesterday evening while walking through a lot of societies and homes, seeing boards saying, ‚ÄúBeware of Dog‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo Trespassing Allowed‚Äù, made me wonder how difficult it is to actually enter someone else‚Äôs life. You first need to build trust with the dog, then the men, then the women, then society guy who only sees distrust in others. ¬†¬†¬†

After coming back from the search, lying on my bed last night, I was thinking about my dreams. Things I want to do in life. Even though there are many things I want to do before I die, the thing that tops the list is building my own home one day.

A home which I would love to live in. There‚Äôs a particular vague design I‚Äôve had in mind since my school days. But it‚Äôs hard to show or draw it, since I‚Äôm bad at designing, and drawing, and sketching. And even if I tried to describe it, my words won‚Äôt do justice to the home I have always imagined in my head.

Of course it‚Äôs huge. So it has to be in my small home town. Of course it has huge lush green lawns surrounded on all sides. Of course it has a big swimming pool, a large theatre covering an entire floor, and one floor just for parties (call it my boiler room) with some great lighting all around.

Every room will have a huge wooden floor balcony too. Can‚Äôt say much about the view though, since it‚Äôs my town, which itself lies in the middle of nowhere, you‚Äôd probably only see empty skies, and a whole lot of trees. And maybe hear a few dogs barking.

I‚Äôll hang a board on the gate saying, ‚ÄúOnly Trespassing Allowed‚Äù. You shall not pass without meeting. Or shooting me. Will keep the ‚ÄúBeware of Dog‚Äù sign though, as the only dog you should be aware of is me. ¬†

But for some reason I thought of Benzene too last night. Maybe I can build my home in Benzene‚Äôs structure, a perfect hexagon. With each wing having its own utility and importance. One for eating; one for watching movies; one for partying; one for sitting and having a cup of tea, or coffee; one for sleeping (maybe will have to make many rooms for the many people I want to accommodate); and maybe one can just be a boring gym. At the center of my hexagon I can have my open lush green lawn, with a big circular swimming pool.

Yeah, that would do.

Just like Benzene, I hope my Benzene will have its simplicity. Bring some order in the chaos of life. And just like the Benzene of Saturn, I hope my Benzene will show the beauty of nature, hiding in plain sight.

I‚Äôll call it my home.

Paul Blart was making his usual Segway rounds, sipping from a thermos of lukewarm coffee, when he spotted something strange near the food court fountain: a giant crate labeled *‚ÄúProperty of the Australian Zoo.‚Äù*

Before Blart could radio it in, the crate rattled violently. Out popped a man in khakis, wide grin on his face, shouting, ‚ÄúCrikey!‚Äù

Paul nearly fell off his Segway. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just just jump out of a crate in the middle of a mall!‚Äù

The man extended his hand warmly. ‚ÄúG‚Äôday, mate! Steve Irwin, wildlife conservationist. I heard rumors there‚Äôs a rogue crocodile roaming around here. Thought I‚Äôd lend a hand.‚Äù

Blart squinted. ‚ÄúA crocodile? In *my mall*?‚Äù

The two men locked eyes. Steve‚Äôs gaze was filled with excitement, Paul‚Äôs with dread. And then the fountain water rippled. A massive reptile tail flicked up, sending mall coins clattering.

Steve‚Äôs face lit up. ‚ÄúThere he is! Isn‚Äôt he *beautiful*?‚Äù

Blart fumbled for his walkie-talkie. ‚ÄúCode‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ Code Croc!‚Äù

Shoppers screamed as the crocodile slithered onto the tile. Blart tried to block it with his Segway, but the croc swiped its tail, sending him tumbling into a Sunglass Hut display.

Steve knelt calmly just feet from the beast. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Paul, I‚Äôve wrangled bigger blokes than this!‚Äù He spoke soothingly to the animal, moving with gentle confidence. Meanwhile, Blart scrambled out of a pile of Ray-Bans, puffing.

‚ÄúSteve, that‚Äôs a *wild animal*! We need mall policy!‚Äù

‚ÄúPolicy won‚Äôt keep him calm, mate. Kindness will.‚Äù

Blart froze, watching as Steve slowly guided the crocodile back toward the fountain. The creature relaxed under his steady presence, finally slipping back into the water.

The crowd, once panicked, burst into applause. Paul dusted himself off, trying to stand tall next to the world-famous wildlife expert.

Steve clapped him on the shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got guts, Blart. Most blokes would‚Äôve run, but you stood your ground.‚Äù

Paul adjusted his badge, cheeks red. ‚ÄúWell, mall security‚Äôs not for the faint of heart.‚Äù

Steve chuckled. ‚ÄúHow about we make a team? You handle the malls, I‚Äôll handle the wildlife. Together, mate, we‚Äôll keep the world safe.‚Äù

Blart thought it over. ‚ÄúFine. But next time, we do it *by the book.*‚Äù

Steve grinned, eyes sparkling. ‚ÄúCrikey, I like you already.‚Äù

And so began the unlikely friendship of Paul Blart, mall cop, and Steve Irwin, crocodile hunter a duo ready for anything, whether it was a shoplifter with sticky fingers or a kangaroo loose in Macy‚Äôs.",1,1759062072.0,ellykatstans,0,1.0,False

1nsmwtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nsmwtm/i_heard_my_best_friends_voice_but_he_was_already/,I heard my best friend‚Äôs voice. But he was already gone.,"My name‚Äôs Adrian. I‚Äôm nineteen, and I live alone in a shitty apartment in a part of town where cops don‚Äôt show up unless someone‚Äôs already dead. The walls are yellowed with old cigarette smoke, the pipes rattle when you run the water, and the neighbor upstairs screams at his girlfriend almost every night. It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs cheap, and at nineteen, cheap matters more than safe.

I‚Äôm not proud of this story. I wish it was fake. I wish I could laugh it off as a nightmare, or some drunken hallucination I half-remembered wrong. But every detail is burned into me, carved so deep I can‚Äôt shake it no matter how much I try.

This happened last year, on a night that was supposed to be fun. Nothing special, nothing memorable. Just me and my best friend, Alex. He‚Äôd been my guy since we were kids loud, fearless, the kind of friend who dared you into trouble and then laughed the hardest when you both got caught. We were drinking buddies, partners in crime, brothers in everything except blood.

It started simple. Too simple.

I bought two bottles of vodka from the corner store cheap shit with labels written half in Russian, half in lies. The kind of liquor that promises warmth but really just tears your throat apart on the way down. The old guy behind the counter didn‚Äôt even card me. He just gave me that tired look, like he‚Äôd seen a thousand nineteen-year-olds make the same mistake and knew I was about to join the graveyard shift of regrets.

Alex showed up around eight. He always carried this restless energy, like he was allergic to silence. He barged in without knocking, tossed his hoodie on the couch, and grinned when he saw the bottles sitting on my table like twin glass grenades.

‚ÄúJesus, man,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúplanning to kill us tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething like that,‚Äù I laughed, trying to sound more confident than I felt. I‚Äôd never bought two before.

We put on music loud, aggressive stuff that made the walls shake, the kind you don‚Äôt notice until it drills into your skull hours later. The room filled up with noise, with laughter, with the sharp clink of glass against glass.

The first shot burned. The second was easier. By the third, my tongue was numb. Alex poured fast and sloppy, splashing vodka on the table, on his shirt, grinning like a lunatic every time he missed his mouth.

We lost track of time. I couldn‚Äôt tell you how many shots we actually took, only that each one blurred the edges of the world a little more, until the walls of my shitty apartment seemed to bend and sway, like they were breathing with us.

I‚Äôd been drunk before, but never like this. This wasn‚Äôt tipsy, wasn‚Äôt funny. My skin prickled hot, my chest buzzing with something that felt like static electricity under the flesh. My thoughts drifted in and out, heavy and loose, like they were caught in water.

I remember laughing too hard, too fast. At nothing. At everything. My voice cracked and echoed in my head in a way that didn‚Äôt sound like me anymore.

Alex was worse. His words bled together in half-coherent sentences, vowels slurred into mush. He‚Äôd stand up, try to gesture, and nearly face plant into the coffee table. Each time, he pulled himself up again, smiling like it was all part of some private joke only he understood.

At one point, he leaned over, close enough for me to smell the sharp bite of vodka sweat pouring out of his skin, and whispered, ‚ÄúYou ever feel like something‚Äôs watching us?‚Äù Then he laughed, like it was nothing. Like it was a joke.

But I remember that part too clearly. Because for a second just a second I felt it too.

Sometime after midnight, we decided we needed ‚Äúfresh air.‚Äù That‚Äôs what drunk kids do, right? They stumble out into the night, convinced the cold air will fix the poison sloshing around inside them.

Alex was the one who suggested it. He stood up, swaying like a broken street sign in the wind, and slurred, ‚ÄúBro‚Ä¶ we gotta gotta breathe. We‚Äôre like‚Ä¶ fish in a tank, man.‚Äù

I laughed too hard, clutching my stomach. ‚ÄúFish in a tank? What the fuck does that even mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means,‚Äù he said, wagging a finger at me like he‚Äôd just made the most profound point of his life, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre suffocating. Air. We need air.‚Äù

So, we went.

We staggered down the cracked sidewalk, shoulders bumping, trying not to trip over the uneven slabs of concrete that had been warping since before we were born. The streetlights above buzzed and hummed, each one flickering like they were dying out one by one. Every step felt heavier, slower, like the air itself was pressing down on us.

The neighborhood was too quiet. I didn‚Äôt notice it at first, not until we‚Äôd walked half a block and I realized: no cars, no people, no faint chatter of TVs from open windows. Nothing. Just the shuffle of our sneakers and the occasional bark of some unseen dog far away.

It felt‚Ä¶ wrong.

‚ÄúYou ever notice,‚Äù Alex muttered, his voice low, conspiratorial, ‚Äúhow empty it gets at night? Like the whole world just‚Ä¶ folds in on itself?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drunk as shit,‚Äù I said, shoving his shoulder, trying to laugh it off. But I didn‚Äôt like the way he said it. Too calm. Too serious.

A few steps later, he tripped over his own shoelace and went sprawling into the middle of the road. His palms slapped the cracked asphalt, and for a second, I thought he‚Äôd hurt himself.

Then he just started laughing. Not a normal laugh this wheezing, gasping fit that made it sound like he couldn‚Äôt breathe. He rolled onto his back, clutching his stomach, tears streaming down his face.

‚ÄúHoly shit, bro!‚Äù he choked out between fits of laughter. ‚ÄúThe road‚Ä¶ the road‚Äôs hugging me!‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus, get up,‚Äù I groaned, reaching down and yanking him up by the hood of his sweatshirt. He stumbled into me, still shaking with laughter, his forehead pressed against my shoulder.

We leaned on each other like idiots, half-walking, half-tripping down the empty street.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd let me die out here, wouldn‚Äôt you?‚Äù he said suddenly, his tone shifting, quieter.

I frowned. ‚ÄúThe fuck are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I just laid down‚Ä¶ right here. In the middle of the street. And some car came speeding‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, grinning through the slur. ‚ÄúWould you pull me out, or would you just watch?‚Äù

I tightened my grip on his hoodie and forced a laugh, though something in his words twisted in my gut. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not dying tonight, dumbass. Not on my watch.‚Äù

But as we kept moving, as the silence stretched around us, I realized I wasn‚Äôt as sure of that as I wanted to be.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. Drunk as I was, it would‚Äôve made sense. Streetlights blurring, shadows shifting hallucinations aren‚Äôt exactly uncommon after half a bottle of vodka. But when I blinked, it was still there.

At the very end of the street, just past the final working streetlight where the asphalt dissolved into darkness, something stood.

It was tall. Way taller than a person. Its arms hung low too low almost grazing the cracked pavement. The skin or what I thought was skin was a sickly gray-white, like old candle wax, slick in places and cracked in others. Under the dim glow, it almost seemed to give off its own faint light, as if it wasn‚Äôt reflecting the lamp but radiating something.

And its head‚Ä¶ its head tilted at this impossible angle, like it was curious about us. Not a playful curiosity. More like how a cat studies a mouse before it pounces.

I stopped laughing instantly. My stomach dropped into ice water.

‚ÄúAlex,‚Äù I whispered, shaking him by the sleeve. ‚ÄúDo you see that?‚Äù

He squinted into the dark, swaying a little. ‚ÄúThe fuck is that?‚Äù he said, voice still thick with alcohol. Then he laughed, a short, sharp bark. ‚ÄúSome crackhead in a costume?‚Äù

But the thing didn‚Äôt move like a person. It swayed gently from side to side, its limbs dragging like they were too heavy or too loose. Every movement was a fraction too slow, then too fast, like a film reel skipping frames.

And then, slowly, it stepped forward.

The sound its foot made on the pavement‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll never forget it. A wet slap, like raw meat hitting tile.

Alex cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted, ‚ÄúHEY! NICE COSTUME, FREAK!‚Äù His voice echoed down the street, swallowed by the dark.

I wanted to run. Every cell in my body screamed at me to run. But my legs felt glued to the concrete.

The creature crouched suddenly, folding in on itself like its joints bent the wrong way. Its head twitched in quick, jerking movements left, right, leftlike a broken camera trying to track us.

Then it made a sound. God, the sound.

It wasn‚Äôt a growl or a scream. It was both. Like metal grinding against itself mixed with a dying animal‚Äôs cry. But threaded through it, faint and wrong, was a human voice.

My voice.

‚ÄúAlex‚Ä¶‚Äù it said. Not exactly. It was warped, wet, as if my voice was bubbling up from underwater. ‚ÄúDo you see that?‚Äù

It was repeating what I had whispered seconds earlier.

Alex‚Äôs laughter cracked. His face drained. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù he whispered, ‚Äúit‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù

Before he could finish, it did it again. This time, Alex‚Äôs voice. Perfectly. ‚ÄúHEY! NICE COSTUME, FREAK!‚Äù it barked back at us, exactly as he‚Äôd said it, but with something‚Ä¶ wrong. Slower. Gurgling. Like it was playing us back on a broken tape recorder.

The creature began to crawl forward on all fours, limbs bending at angles that made my stomach churn. Its fingers if they were fingers spread wide, dragging long, dark streaks across the pavement.

Alex grabbed my arm hard enough to bruise. ‚ÄúDude. We need to go. We need to go now.‚Äù

We took a step back.

The thing took two steps forward.

It whispered again, both of our voices layered over each other, words tripping and stuttering like it was learning how to talk: ‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ see‚Ä¶ that‚Ä¶ hey‚Ä¶ freak‚Ä¶‚Äù

That broke me.

‚ÄúRun!‚Äù I screamed, finally finding my voice.

And we did.

I don‚Äôt remember how long we ran. Time felt broken, stretched thin. The vodka burned in my stomach with every ragged breath, threatening to come back up. My legs screamed, my vision pulsed, but I could still hear Alex beside me wheezing, stumbling, gasping for air.

And behind us those wet, heavy footsteps. Faster. Louder. Slapping the pavement in a rhythm that grew closer and closer.

We turned down a narrow alley, the kind of place that stank like piss and rot, and collapsed against a rusted dumpster. I pressed myself flat, hands trembling, chest heaving. Alex bent over, clutching his side, sweat dripping down his face despite the cold.

We both listened.

At first, all I could hear was my own heartbeat hammering in my ears. The footsteps had stopped. The street outside was silent.

For a second, I dared to hope. Maybe we lost it.

Alex looked at me, wide-eyed, lips quivering like he wanted to laugh but couldn‚Äôt. He opened his mouth

And that‚Äôs when it happened.

Something reached out from the darkness.

A hand or what looked like one snapped around his ankle. Long, pale fingers glistening, like they‚Äôd been dipped in oil. They bent in too many places, knuckles bulging where no knuckles should be.

Alex screamed.

‚ÄúNO! NO, NO, NO!‚Äù

I lunged for him, grabbing his hoodie, pulling with everything I had. My arms shook, my lungs burned, but I didn‚Äôt let go. He kicked, clawed at the concrete, his nails splitting and peeling back, streaks of blood smearing the pavement.

‚ÄúADRIAN! HELP ME!‚Äù His voice cracked so sharp it split me open inside.

‚ÄúI‚ÄôM TRYING!‚Äù I shouted, my throat raw. ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM NOT LETTING GO!‚Äù

But the thing was strong. Too strong. Its arm stretched impossibly far, dragging him backward into the shadows like he weighed nothing. I pulled until the fabric tore, until my hands slipped on the blood slicking his skin. Until his nails bent back so far I could hear the sickening snap of bone.

And then he was gone.

The alley was silent again. Silent except for me gasping, sobbing, choking on air.

I sat there, shaking, staring at the space where Alex had been seconds earlier. The blood on the ground, the torn scraps of fabric still clutched in my fists.

I didn‚Äôt see him again. Not a body, not a shoe. Nothing. When I told the cops, they looked at me like I was just another drunk college kid making excuses. Their report said ‚Äúpossible runaway.‚Äù

Runaway.

His parents still call sometimes. Fifteen missed calls in a single night once. His mom‚Äôs voice breaking as she begged me, begged me to tell her what really happened. But what the hell am I supposed to say?

That some thing pulled him into the dark and erased him? That I was too drunk, too weak, too useless to save him?

The guilt eats me alive. Especially because of what came after.

Because when I finally staggered out of that alley, broken and soaked in sweat, I heard something behind me.

Footsteps. Slow. Wet.

And then‚Ä¶ Alex‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúAdrian‚Ä¶‚Äù

My blood froze.

I turned, and there it was. That pale, swaying figure at the mouth of the alley. Its head twitching, jerking side to side like a broken marionette. And from its gaping mouth or whatever slit it had it spoke again.

‚ÄúAdrian‚Ä¶ help me.‚Äù

It was Alex‚Äôs voice. Perfect. The same crack in his throat, the same panic. Except it wasn‚Äôt him. I knew it wasn‚Äôt him.

But drunk and terrified, I almost ran back to it. I almost believed.

Then it laughed. Alex‚Äôs laugh, warped and doubled, like a recording played too slow. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt help me, Adrian. You let me go.‚Äù

I bolted. I didn‚Äôt look back this time.

And I swear, even now, even sober, I still hear it sometimes. Outside my window at night. In the quiet, when I‚Äôm alone.

Alex‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúAdrian‚Ä¶ why didn‚Äôt you save me?‚Äù

It‚Äôs been almost a year. I don‚Äôt drink anymore. I can‚Äôt. The smell of alcohol makes me sick, makes me gag. Just walking past a bar sends a rush of bile up my throat. People think it‚Äôs about self-control, about ‚Äúgrowing up.‚Äù It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs about survival.

But no matter how sober I‚Äôve been, it hasn‚Äôt gone away.

It started small. Flickers. A shadow too tall to be a person at the end of the block. A pale smudge of something under a flickering streetlight when I come home from my late shift. I‚Äôd blink and it would be gone. Sometimes I‚Äôd convince myself it was a trick of exhaustion. Sometimes I‚Äôd convince myself I was drunk again without realizing it.

But it isn‚Äôt a trick.

It‚Äôs always there, always in the periphery, like it‚Äôs waiting for me to forget what I saw.

Two weeks ago, I woke up at 3:17 a.m. to the sound of footsteps on the street outside my apartment. Slow, deliberate. That wet, meaty slap of flesh on concrete that I know too well. It didn‚Äôt stop at the street. It came up the stairs. One step at a time.

Slap.
Pause.
Slap.

I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt breathe. My phone was in my hand, screen glowing, but my fingers wouldn‚Äôt dial. Because some part of me already knew there was no one to call.

It stopped outside my door.

For a long time, nothing happened. No knock, no sound. Just a shape under the crack of the door: pale, impossibly long fingers curling in slow, rhythmic motions, like it was drumming out a thought.

Then, softly, a voice.

‚ÄúAdrian‚Ä¶‚Äù

It was Alex‚Äôs voice. Not broken or panicked this time. Calm. Almost sweet.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm cold, man. Why‚Äôd you leave me?‚Äù

I pressed both hands over my mouth to stop from screaming.

It chuckled Alex‚Äôs chuckle but stretched, wet, wrong. ‚ÄúOpen the door, Adrian. It‚Äôs just me. I‚Äôm still your friend.‚Äù

The fingers slid back. Silence.

When I finally found the courage to move, the space under the door was empty. The hallway was quiet.

But I know it isn‚Äôt gone.

I‚Äôve started finding small things out of place in my apartment. My front door unlocked when I‚Äôm sure I locked it. Wet, grayish smears on my windowsill even though I live on the third floor. Last night, I woke up and my phone was open to my camera roll, scrolling by itself, showing old photos of Alex and me. Pictures I don‚Äôt even remember taking.

And then, the latest occurance was yesterday at 4:45 a.m., the sound again. The wet slap of footsteps. But this time it wasn‚Äôt outside the door.

It was inside.

I could hear it in the kitchen. Slow. Measured. Crossing the linoleum toward my bedroom.

Slap.
Pause.
Slap.

I didn‚Äôt check. I didn‚Äôt move. I lay there frozen, staring at the ceiling, my heartbeat loud in my ears.

Because I know what it came for.

It didn‚Äôt just want Alex.

It‚Äôs been practicing. Learning. Wearing his voice like a mask.

It wants me too.

But i am ready to confront it if i have too. Because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to leave empty handed this time.

Bitcoin is down 2% and ETH is down 10%, it is far more brutal for smaller caps though, but they'll bounce back.

Whilst I have already mentioned you will probs make money with anything you buy rn, but the thing is choosing randomly is not the way. **Buying random coin with a funny name that is making the rounds on social media is not the way, these coins do not last, instead choose coins backed by communities that have worked non stop for over a year.** This is why you should buy Kendu, we are not going anywhere at all, it is a high conviction investment and this is NFA but there is absolutely 0 buying at these levels and beyond. I am literally a uni student with about ¬£250 to my name and I put all spare money into Kendu knowing it is free money and the odds are way in my favour.

https://reddit.com/link/1nsmwom/video/hutidg74ewrf1/player

Kendu is building a real foundation not just with an amazing social media presence which tbh deserves a billion dollar market cap by itself, but also with an insane real life presence. This real life presence will spread into every single industry, spreading the Kendu brand globally ensuring that every single country has holds Kendu. 

Here is a list of these efforts:

* Kendu Coffee 
* Kendu Energy
* Kendu Merch
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation¬†
* Kendu Board Game
* Kendu Creator
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer
* Kendu Video Games
* Tattoos¬†
* Murals
* Kendu Entertainment
* Kendu Street Team
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee
* Kendu Press¬†
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers
* Kendu Spice
* Kendu Radio Show

All of these are not done by a team, but by the average holder! 

Kendu is completely decentralised, 1000 minds are better than 10 and this is how we are revolutionising the space all whilst sitting at around 10 million market cap. Shib 1000x in 36 days and so can Kendu, 10 billion would actually be undervalued, no one has done anything on this scale with this ferocity ever

Here's the breakdown
- Income
I live and work in london, currently earn ¬£38k / year before tax, which equates to ¬£2392.11 / month after tax / student loan / pension etc.
I'm a designer and I (used to, before it dried up) do a fair bit of moonlighting on the side of my job, working weekends and evenings? However, I've not had this in a while but do have a job coming up which is up to 17 days work which will be a little over ¬£6k if I bill the full amount.
My partner doesn't earn as much as me and much of her salary is based off commission so it fluctuates month on month but she can bring home between ¬£2.2k-¬£2.7k

-Outgoings
I rent with my partner and we share all bills, food costs and so on which equals around ¬£1200 / month each plus an extra ¬£150 each that we pay in for joint savings / extra one offs that we need. My total regular outgoings (including what I split with my partner) which includes things like my phone bill, transport etc is ~¬£1695. That leaves me just under ¬£700 a month. What i worked out this morning is that this month alone i spent ¬£40 on coffees, ¬£55 on lunches and a whopping ¬£390 on going out / beers etc. I also had a lot of costs that I needed to cover outside of this that were one off payments, I had to buy a new suit for a wedding as I didn‚Äôt own one, amongst a few other things and these ""one offs"" are reoccurring - albeit from different sources. 

-Debts
¬£3.8k on one credit card
¬£5.1k on a 0% card until the end of 2026.  My partner has just used my card to pay for a ¬£1350 expense as she isn't from the UK and is going through the motions of renewing her visa, which i put on the 0% so that she could pay me back over time (¬£65 / month) 
¬£116.08 on another card
Totaling around ¬£9k

-Savings
¬£5.2k in a LISA
¬£12.5k in a simple saver (5k of which is was recently given by a relative for personal reasons but I would ideally not want to touch that) and some of this will need to go to paying my tax bill at the end of the year for 24/25 from the moonlighting i did last year, which i earned around ¬£11k net profit from doing that.

I feel stuck, I hate my job and I'm looking to leave before the end of the year, it's an incredibly toxic working environment and I'm looking to go full time freelance. I don't know how others sustain themselves while living here, it seems far too expensive to hold any form of social life / hobbies.

I guess after this ramble my questions are:
Is going freelance possible given my financial situation? 

How do I get out of this constant loop of spending most of my income because I try and pay off my debts from the previous month only to then rebuild the debt the current month?

Am I in any sort of position financially to invest?

Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated, I'm happy to provide more info if needed.
Thank you!

Please feel free to comment, share advice, or honest feedback even if it‚Äôs tough to hear. I will take it.

I‚Äôve been in a messy situation with someone I was seeing. It started with light drinks, movies, and the occasional sleepover, and she started having feelings, I eventually realized despite my emotions being a bit slower to develop than hers,  I was the one initiating everything. After a small disagreement, I stepped back to see if she‚Äôd take the lead, we met a few times after that but things just faded because she started ghosting me.

She‚Äôs struggling with bipolar disorder, drinks heavily, smokes weed, and does drugs sometimes. Whereas I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I want to stay healthy, work full-time  in finance, and study part-time. Still, losing her has hurt more than I expected.

What happened last night: My friends encouraged me to talk to her in person after her late shift, because I have been heartbroken. I waited outside the coffee shop where she works ( its 2 minutes from where I live) , When she came out, she was with a guy. I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene, so I said, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre busy, it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù She said ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù and I left. I went home feeling a lot of emotions.

This morning I sent her this message:

(Hey ! I just wanted to explain why I waited for you after your shift last night. I‚Äôve been going through a difficult time emotionally, and my friends encouraged me to talk to you in person (showing up like that isn‚Äôt something I would normally do, and I‚Äôm sorry if it made you uncomfortable).

When I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre busy‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to bother you or interrupt anything. And when you said ‚Äúokay‚Äù I understood that you might prefer not to talk.

Please know I won‚Äôt be reaching out or showing up like that again (no matter who encourages me :D). I know I‚Äôve said this before and didn‚Äôt follow through, and I‚Äôm sorry for that. It‚Äôs not really who I am, and I hope you understand it all came from a place of care.

I truly valued you as someone I cared for and hoped to keep in my life. But I also completely respect your boundaries.

I‚Äôm genuinely glad to see you well. Take care!)

No response yet!

I don't know what happened and why she started ghosting me, she wouldn't talk to me and she was the one pushing for a relationship.

For context: we‚Äôre both from different countries, and currently living in a third country. After last night, all I want to do is buy a flight ticket and go back home or just get as far away as possible.",2,1759061530.0,LesbianActually,4,1.0,False

**Entry 00**

Maybe there‚Äôs some beauty in my stuffy beige carpet. Something grossly divine about the way I lay upon it sprawled out, eyes and nose running, lungs ripped out, bones aching, cradled by these people who have created these things that help me build what people see. It will be dark outside and In my room it will smell of coffee and commercial body spray and smoke and incense and it will choke you but it will be fucking beautiful and this skin that they keep me in will glow slightly by the light of the lamp that is on my desk, white and torn up and there will be a slight glow around my head like a halo, but not quite.

I am only very young but that is raw and sometimes when I lie on that floor, the earth is beneath me and I can feel the hands of the dead or perhaps the angels pushing up from beneath the blood-stained carpets and offering my body to the sky, that is not yet willing to welcome me.

I will beg if I am not already laying limp and the angels or those who had passed will look on, pity or something deeper in those stone eyes, looking at my struggling body and my watery eyes and my screams the way my mother looked at me after I tried to force the heavens open myself.¬†

I have never been a beautiful person. There is a hope, a delusion in my ribcage that grows with flowers every now and then, that drawing this blood will alleviate me somehow and I will see eye to eye with those stone creatures, and perhaps it is not their blood that runs down their cheeks in place of tears, but mine, and all of the sick, carcasses of those like me(are there any like me). They are portrayed in such a golden light but they are just like me. They are sent to collect these broken bodies. All they know is blood and recently I have found it is all I know as well. Those stone creatures smile when I tell them that this carcass I live in cannot be controlled by this heart and this head and it will try to find its way to those gates no matter what I tell it.

**five**

Returning to these grotesque visions of divinity. Slipping back into the old house where the walls are painted with blood and a cross hangs above every doorway. Slipping is perhaps too gentle a word when the situation was more similar to being taken hostage, but maybe things happen for a reason and I needed these flesh wounds to realize that maybe where I belong is in the arms of these stone angels that return to me now.

The house where they take me is cold but it‚Äôs familiar and that‚Äôs all the comfort I need. Sure, the only place to sleep is on the floor and there is nothing to satisfy my growing hunger but I lived here for a very long time. I would rather sit among recognizable graves and suffer a familiar silence than get used to finally having feeling inside these crooked bones. It feels smothered. This room. All of the veins beneath skin and all of the disgusting assets that make us raw are all flattened and hidden beneath the dirty blue walls. We are all actors. Actor feels like the wrong word. Puppets. No. We are all children. Playing bittersweet makes us believe games day in and day out pretending that we grew up. All of us wander these same halls and do these same tasks that are worthless in the end.¬†

Kings are not born from mediocrity and writing lines. Kings are borne from flesh and the realization that that is all we are.¬†

Blame is only upon those who attempt to preserve the mediocre everyday, the ones so in love with the routine, the make believe. Social expectations are not only a bore they are restraining. The angels have helped me understand this too, to ascend you must ascend in every aspect. Picking and choosing is not an option when it comes to matters such as this. He is called all-knowing for a reason and I am all-becoming. Canonization is a grueling task.

**Four**

As soon as I find myself in a moment of boredom I can feel myself slip down into this place of words where these words find me unwillingly. I find myself wondering if we are born with the need to self-destruct or if we are taught it. I find myself trying to write about something different than blood and angels and I think I have it now. I do not write because I feel as if I should be writing, or because I want to write a book or even just a story. There is no motive and that is a comfort. I write because I need to. Because writing untangles the strange feelings and the new knowledge under my skin and lays them flat, neat, orderly. In the afternoons and maybe at night I feel like asking the sky if I‚Äôm doing good enough, tell the sun that at times she hurts many eyes and sometimes I ask her why.

**3**

Bleed me out. Until my veins are dry and maybe then all the holy blood he placed within me will finally be gone and then I will finally be able to be forgiven.¬†

May then the strings of veins of muscle and godforsaken bone will cease to pile on me.¬†

I can't swim this sea anymore, very soon I will drown again.¬†

There are hands, wretched ones, laden in scars almost twin to mine that claw my jaw open past its breaking point and reach up further than I ever could.¬†

He (god?) only does it to make me jealous, he knows I don't have the ability to blame and he uses it to remove my teeth one by one and string them in a necklace that spells love (how he sees it).

He could gut me at this point and my unholy guilt would choke me about staining his shirt (the one i gave him).¬†

I can no longer smile because you are using my teeth to bite after yours were lost, buried in my neck.¬†

My neck is pistoned together by two golden crosses. I can feel them in my throat.¬†

Throat god, throat is such a godawful word. My throat IS my rosary, I pray upon it and the things it has seen, unceremoniously bared to the earth.¬†

Somebody comes down from the clouds I'm so familiar with but so far away from and pries my throat open from the front, slices it down and opens it with your knives so I might finally be able to breathe. Forgive me please god forgive me, even in the form of death, is it my burden and my burden only to drown in the sea of this fucking guilt.¬†

Pulling me back down into this well, there are scratches down my legs and they do not bleed but I can feel they are so much deeper than they were before.

I‚Äôm clawing and kicking and screaming and my tears have spilled over into holy water that burns my skin and his ‚Äòlove‚Äô has given me a taste of hell I hadn't even seen in my moments closest to death. I can feel the crucifixes burning themselves into the inside of my cheeks, my teeth, my teeth, I can taste blood on them. I am only a visitor in this space. I will go soon, I am only viewing it, this is not my body, nor my brain, nor my house and these are not my friends. They are his friends, who ‚ÄòI‚Äô was before the crown of thorns drew my bloody future, and I will ruin it for him I will ruin all of it. I cannot bear to touch another person, so I will rip myself apart. Myself in a literal way and a way that refers to him as also a part of me.

**2**

They have taken a backseat, the situation is similar to when a child is sent down a hill without training wheels or when a play is performed with no rehearsal. I haven‚Äôt yet learned how to walk on my own two feet metaphorically and literally and yet here I am, walking past him again and shaking like a leaf, breathing only barely. What is it about him that scares me so entirely?? It feels as if I have a gaping hole in my torso, festering, still leaking blood and liquid gold, maybe he opened the wound that spilt my divinity, it splashes in a disgusting manner on the pavement where I walk, gold and interlaced with my (???) blood and chunks of my (???) own flesh. If you look at it from certain angles I‚Äôm sure you could make it out as a kind of halo, some semblance of wings. Said angle is, i‚Äôm sure, only reachable from above, where I am still not permitted. They still prefer to watch me bleed out, contaminated veins, raw eyes, decaying skin, open mouth, teeth bared. God. I pray to myself that in the end this might be worth it. That one day, soon I hope, I will not have to yelp like a dog at the door in the middle of the night, the blood on my neck looking so much like water in the light of the moon, and being treated just as such. Perhaps, I will sit at that door and wait patiently, blood bubbling from my lips, until I am offered a hand that will lead to a waltz.¬†

My dance with death will be long and god it will be beautiful. His scythe will dance like a ribbon often does and my sorrows will serve as our dancefloor. Dealt with and finely polished.¬†

**Things i can remember**¬†

* Feeling the hands of the angels pushing up through the floor to hold me as offering towards the heavens
* Never being allowed in
* Never once turning off the light
* Crucifying myself, or trying to in order to finally achieve holiness god fucking dammit
* Having out of the blue manic episodes when i would do things like build 7 foot paper angels
* Canonising myself
* There is no god only this disgusting vessel of bones and blood laced with gold it was not god but MYSELF that painted that metallic sheen, I am holier even than him, there is no white stone facade upon my prayers, I represent all that is grotesque, everything that bleeds. GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD. I don't know how to externalise this canonisation all i know is i feel the wings blooming deep within me and i am now sure i cannot be stopped. They will now let me in and back and oh god my bones and oh god the thorns encircling my head.

I MIGHT FIND MYSELF?¬†¬†

**1.**

I wait and I wait and I never think about the present, only the past and very rarely the future.

Is creating people very similar to creating music or am I only aware of the 12 notes from c to g?

You scream your words and etch your way into every single sentence I write and I know I‚Äôll never be able to bleed you out of my veins.

¬†

**(and separation of the mind)**

I know many of you will remind me that it is not in fact the crucifixion of Christ and his stigmata that caused him to ascend, it was his connection with the lord and their almost equalness. Stigmata achieves just that. Im a fucking genius. My plan is to self inflict this stigmata to deepen my connection with this man i HATE and so much so that we will be almost equal so that when i do die i may ascend higher even than him. He‚Äôll see he‚Äôll regret not letting me into MY territory.¬†

It is this breed of suffering I do not like. Selfish.. But.

It is some kind of singularity that I crave.

There is no hierarchy at least there will not be for long.

I prefer my plans to be vague outlines as opposed to clear.

Perhaps they edited the¬† bible, they lied, to hide the fact that his wounds were indeed what caused him to rise and sit upon my rightful throne. To perhaps protect the fragile human shell from harming oneself to rise higher.

God is an all encompassing figure, one that I am part of and him, part of me but Jesus is but a man, a naive and stupid one.¬†

Do not knock upon my ears. I'm listening. I swear I'm listening.

Perhaps instead it is like God is the sun and Jesus the moon and I am but a star.¬†

Or perhaps I am Judas in my desperation to find a sin I cannot be forgiven for.

**(and separation)**

I am no longer in control, something that rather contradicts my status/position.

I receive these wounds, this stigmata as protest. If I am so angry about him ‚Äúpermitting‚Äù others to receive his wounds (prick) then why are my bones so set on becoming this all-consuming entity, surely one must make peace with those lower than himself. Haha.¬†

I have recently discovered that it is more than likely that their world is one entirely different to our own. All my presence on this specific (earthly) plan, will do is teach those who do not know of it.¬†

I will disappear for a very long time from this dimension, to teach and be taught. And then I will return to my usual activities, no one will notice the slight glow emanating from my skull, neither will they notice the replacement of my blood with ichor beneaht these layers of muscle. They never have noticed, ignorant beasts.

¬†

**(and)**

I SEEK TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIM AS HE HAS MADE A FOOL OF me. I WILL SHOW HIM I CAN SURVIVE WHAT HE WAS UNABLE TO AND BECOME ALL CONSUMING ALL SEEING AND FINALLY, FINALLY I WILL BECOME BEAUTIFUL AND I WILL BE ALONE. ALONE ALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEalone.

It is bittersweet that they have always viewed me as an enigma, a spectacle. Looked down upon my crying eyes as I danced within THEIR circus for their entertainment.

They do not even know what I am yet to become. You're not ready for this unholy blood to spill and stain your hands. Perhaps this blood is yet just another call for help but i find that I no longer care.

**‚Ä¶**

**(a physical observation)**

I can feel and I can see my face, my head exploding outward and into a shape much like that of a flower and it has teeth and colour and petals and it says everything that I am unable to and it does not need explanation and it grows wings and then I can die. And then I can die in peace. Boom.¬†

I‚Äôm feeling things in these bones I never have before, or at least not in a very long time. Everyone can see me, I'll never be truly alone.

**‚Ä¶**

**(ONE OF MY FINAL CONCLUSIONS)**

There is someone else out there wearing my rightful body and his name happens to be god.

**‚Ä¶**
