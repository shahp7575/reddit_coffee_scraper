1n6hygc,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1n6hygc/do_heartbreakers_even_care/,Do Heartbreakers Even Care?,"I'm currently in a new relationship that's been rocky to start. I care about this girl a lot, and things started out well. We had a lot of passionate feelings, but shes recently scaled back and even said she no longer wants to remain exclusive with me. She's considering a future with me, but has gotten red flags as her girlfriends have accused me of love bombing. This isnt the first time I've been called this either. 

It had me thinking why does this keep happening? Why do I latch onto a partner with intense feelings? Is it because I wear my heart on my sleeve? Is it because im a hopeless romantic? After some reminiscing, and talking with life long friends, ive decided its due to all the traumas in my life around dating. For context, my upbringing wasnt the best. A chaotic childhood with parents fighting, a nasty divorce, homelessness, and being abandoned by one of my parents. Even with all that childhood trauma, the events that stick out to me the most are the heartbreaks. Those hurt the most. 

My first girlfriend who took my virginity was playing me and my friend at the same time. She told me she loved me for over a year as we were dating. The whole year she was sleeping with my friend behind my back. Another girlfriend who I grew very close with in my late teens ghosted me completely out of the blue. I found out she left me for my best friend who she had been talking to behind my back. I lost my best friend and my girlfriend on the same day. I had another girlfriend after whose parents hated me just because I wasnt wealthy enough to be with their daughter. I fought for 12 months to be with this girl, just for her to end it because he parents couldnt come to terms with us being together. I had a high school crush who I absolutely adored. I was best friends with her, but I could never tell her how I really felt. One day we were hanging out in my car when she kissed me. I was dumbfounded, but I went with it. We had a moment for a few weeks until she ghosted me. I saw her driving around with another one of my friends a few days later. In my 20s, I dated a really nice girl who I found was chatting with other men on a dating app. Naturally, I ended the relationship which hurt a lot, but it hurt even more when she sent me a self harm video saying this was all my fault. Fast forward to more recently. Last year I met a great girl. We hit it off, had a deep connection, and were building a tight bond. Then she texts me one morning to meet for coffee where she tells me she's been working on relocation at work thats been accepted. She's moving away and we wont be able to work long distance. This particular experience was so traumatic that SHE was crying while I had to console HER. The person who made this decision felt so badly about it that she was hysterically crying. So why make this decision??

Fast forward to today. I'm with someone new. We start out strong, but I'm quickly met with ""the talk"" where im told this needs to cool off and maybe we can rekindle later. Was I love bombing? Maybe, but if anyone gave a shit, they would get to know why I do this. A lifetime of traumatic experiences in relationships that were so bad that my childhood trauma pales in comparison. Do I have trust issues? Sure. But I think my trust issues are warranted. ",1,1756815642.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

1n6hwnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1n6hwnm/my_review_of_various_brewing_equipment_i_own/,My review of various brewing equipment i own,"I started my journey few years back with a Drip machine. Own like 4 different equipment now, so thought of writing a comparison post as most people on this forum are one team or the other...


1. Agaro Drip Coffee Maker: 3 years old, still fills the whole kitchen with amazing coffee aroma in the mornings... Beginner friendly, only variable is amount of coffee vs water. Little to no skill required. However, the coffee flavor is not as great as say French Press.

2. French Press: I use the Hoffman recipe here... brews a great coffee. The best Black coffee among the ones have tried. Also use this for cold brews, so another +. Only catch being, due to brewing time... coffee is ready at slightly lower temperature than the earlier method. So if am working and drinking, it often gets less warm by the last sip. If you are drinking immediately, it's a wonderful option. Some basic skill is required.

3. SIFC: The best coffee according to me (Am south indian, so kinda biased as I enjoy this since childhood). Easy to make. Can tolerate mistakes, low skill required. Can also brew chicory Blend coffee. Thanks to slow brewing, it extracts way more flavor than a Moka pot. Except the brewing time which is one of the longest... there's nothing you can complain here (~30 mins for 2 cups). 

4. Moka Pot: The most difficult to brew for a beginner and the most expensive setup among the four. It honestly punishes you if you make any mistake. It took me approx 10+ attempts to finally get the recipe right. E.g. most suggest using hot water in the bottom chamber, but I prefer dark roasts... so the coffee often comes out tasting just bitter. The solution was to use room temperature water instead. Makes a great cup of milk coffee in under 5 mins. So preferred if I want to drink coffee sooner than later.


Coming to my fav beans... Yet to buy a grinder (cost constraint)

100% Robusta Medium roast from Mercara gold estate at coorg. Used with both sifc and moka pot.

Cothas Hotel Blend, the OG filter coffee powder.

BT Vienna Roast for black coffees (i love bitter over acidic coffee) but currently overpriced.

Araku Signature for black coffees, recent purchase based on forum recommendation. Kinda enjoying it.

Note: I often purchase coffee from lower end of price segment,  so most fancy coffee brands haven't been tested yet.

1n6hwgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n6hwgv/wiring_problem_la_pavoni_eurobar_de_luxe_edl/,Wiring problem [La Pavoni Eurobar de luxe EDL],"Hello!

I've been trying to restore my la pavoni eurobar 'de luxe' to full functionality. Bought it 5 years ago at a second hand (kringloop) shop in Amsterdam for 15 euros. It is the same as shown in this post of a guy who beat my price [https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1abxeh6/999\_thrift\_store\_find/](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1abxeh6/999_thrift_store_find/)  
Worked fine for years so all I have done so far is replace the shower screen - i.e the piece with little holes from which the coffee pours out- and the portafilter itself, a little o ring of the steam wand. Lately though it had been leaking slightly whenever the pressure got too high, seemingly directly from the boiler. so I took it apart and saw intense corrosion not in the boiler but in the lower alluminum part that holds the portafilter in a bajonet lock, attached underneath the boiler. Assuming that that could have caused the leak, I have replaced that lower portafilter-holding part. Initially managed to find it nowhere on the internet  but finally did find it here in Amsterdam (credits to Duikelman).  
Now I'm putting everything back together and realize the pictures of the wiring I took before disconnecting everything were not detailed enough, and I can't see where every wire should be reconnected to. Have been looking for diagrams but no luck so far. Feel kind of stupid, not an electrician at all. Does anyone have a diagram or maybe know another more intuitive way to safely reconnect everything...?

Worth trying again?,"I used to drink a lot of coffee for over a decade, around 4–5 cups a day. I felt very dependent, had gut issues, and poor sleep. I decided to quit caffeine. I tapered down with tablets, from 400 mg to 12.5 mg in 2 months.

I stayed off coffee for 3 months, but honestly didn’t notice many positive effects:

Sleep quality was still poor, no real change

Frequent brain fog

Even some depressive moods, no motivation


The only clear improvement was reduced excessive sweating – I sweated much less in the summer, which was a big plus - maybe this means less anxiety?

I went back to coffee after a tough situation (poor sleep + a long car drive), and now I’ve been drinking again for 2 weeks. Back to caffeine wasn't also nothing spectacular, just felt more awake. 

I have mixed feelings – no major negative or positive changes, apart from the sweating and reduced compulsive urge to drink coffee, plus saved lots of money for takeaway coffees.

Do you think 3 months is too short to reset the nervous system after so many years of heavy caffeine use?

For context: I live healthy, don’t drink alcohol at all, and I train regularly. I was hoping to see the big benefits people often describe here after quitting caffeine, but it didn’t really happen.

Walking out, it's a runt leaping at all corners, wanting breakfast. Her siblings use another one to do something borderline illegal. Only one of them is a nice, quiet and obedient one.

Of course, she's a victim of their bullying.

""STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER!""

Peace, just for a moment. And it isn't completed with a warm hug from the back.

Seokjun and Yongjin jumped Kang In, with Seokjun using his overwhelming technique and speed to land attacks in his blind spot, repeatedly.  
His movements were sharp, surgical—like a blade slicing at seams only he could see. Kang In flinched too late, reacting to pain already delivered.

Even a raindrop can erode a stone away. But if it wasn’t enough... then a hammer was needed.  
The hammer came flying.

**KAPOW!**

Yongjin’s fists crashed forward, each one carrying the weight of pent-up fury. They weren’t just strikes; they were detonations, pounding Kang In’s stance into rubble. He staggered, feet skidding, arms too slow to keep up.

What once looked like a monster, unstoppable, untouchable, was now reduced to a glorified punching bag. The terror had cracks. The aura had thinned. Every blow dragged him further down from the pedestal he’d built for himself.

*“Grrr…”*  
A knee shot up, cracking against his nose. The sound was wet, sharp—like branches snapping underfoot. Blood burst out in a fine spray.

*“RAGGGHH!”*  
He lashed out wildly, claws where fists should have been. Desperation made him faster, but not cleaner.

Yongjin slipped in.

***BOOM!***

A straight punch that knocked him sideways. Kang In’s jaw twisted, his body staggering like a tower hit at the base. For a moment, he wasn’t a monster. Just a man reeling.

It wasn't that Kang In was weak. He was an absolute novice who relied solely on brute strength and endurance.

To him, fighting was just taking people down 1 by 1. A punch and a kick meant the same to him. Both made the men against him fly away.

Grabbing was fun, but it ruined any fun. Their bones would shatter and fall. No more fighting.

It wasn’t that Kang In was weak. No—he was a monster of flesh and bone, carved wrong by nature. Seven fingers curling into fists too wide for normal grips. Blackened bones that could take a crowbar’s kiss and not crack. Muscles packed so tight with the MSTN curse that every move felt like a cannonball.

But he was still a novice. Fighting, to him, was just… breaking things.  
A punch.  
A kick.  
No difference. Both made people fly.

And grabbing? Oh, he loved grabbing. To feel bones splinter under his grip—snapping like twigs, warm in his palm. But it always ended the game too soon. Broken toys don’t fight back. No more fun.

*“Grrr…”*  
He lunged, knee spiking up—only for Seokjun to slip aside, flowing like smoke. The strike cut nothing.

*“RAGGGHH!”*  
Seven-fingered fists swung wide, fast, furious.  
But Yongjin’s punch hammered into his ribs, blowing him sideways.

**\[Kang In Cheon's potential is rumbling!\]**

*Stap... hi...*  
*yuo... grrr...*

He reeled, teeth clattering as Seokjun’s kick snapped across his jaw. Kang In swung back, wild, but Seokjun was gone again—vanishing, twisting, kicking from angles he couldn’t track.

**\[Kang In Cheon's potential is rumbling!\]**

*'e no com fornt...*  
*snek... all tim... grrr*

Yongjin stepped in, his fists like piledrivers, battering Kang In’s chest and chin. Each strike shook his black bones, made his dense muscles groan.

**\[Kang In Cheon's potential is rumbling!\]**

*agai?!?!?!?!*

But the duo worked like gears in a machine. Seokjun cut him low, Yongjin crushed him high. Every time he roared forward, one stole his balance, the other slammed him down.

Kang In’s fury mounted. He couldn’t catch them. Couldn’t grab. Couldn’t smash. His power meant nothing if he couldn’t land it.

**\[Kang In Cheon's potential is rumbling!\]**

*COM ME COM MI COM MI!*

The child’s simplicity was still there, but now it was raw rage, pure frustration. Every miss, every counter, ground his pride into dust.

People had praised him for his talent, and others were envious, but he didn't understand any of it. He was just Kang In. 

The Kang In who fought people.  
The Kang In who beats the invaders.

Yet these guys... were pushing him back?  
They were daring... to make the sun set?  
Kang In didn't understand it, but a feeling of rage and hatred was building up in him...

People had praised him for his talent.  
Others had whispered envy, muttered fear.

But Kang In never understood any of it.

He was just Kang In.  
The Kang In who stood, solid, unshaken, reliable, like the sun in the sky.

And the sun never sets. The sun never loses.

Yet here they were.  
Two men.  
Two gnats.  
And still… they were pushing him back?

*I... fal?*

**\[Kang In Cheon's potential is growing!\]**

Each strike drove the thought deeper, cracked it open. His teeth bared, his breath came ragged. Something hot and foul boiled in his chest, not fear, not pain—something older.

They dared.  
They dared to make the sun set.

Kang In didn’t understand the words for it. But the feeling of rage, hatred, raw hunger, was clawing its way out of him. His seven-fingered hands curled tight, bones groaning under the strain. His muscles swelled with the effort of holding it in.

The air around him seemed to ripple, like heat from a furnace. His eyes burned red, veins crawling dark across his skin.

**\[The Crimson Ogre is angered!\]**

The child’s simplicity was warping. His fury was taking shape.

**\[The Oni within Kang In Cheon is taking shape!\]**

Kang In roared and lashed out, his seven-fingered fists hammering down. The floor split beneath him, tiles cracking like eggshells under a sledgehammer. Dust leapt into the air with every strike. He moved like a wild beast, no rhythm, no restraint—just violence spilling in every direction.

“Haaa… now he’s desperate?” Seokjun hissed through clenched teeth, twisting aside as a fist cratered the ground where he had stood. His movements stayed sharp, controlled—but his eyes narrowed. This was no longer the same fight.

Yongjin sidestepped another furious swing, his knuckles flexing, ready to punish the next opening. “Hurt his pride,” he muttered, gaze steady.

Because Kang In wasn’t fighting them anymore.  
He was fighting *everything*.  
The walls. The floor. The very air.

Every blow screamed frustration, rage made flesh. His childlike pride, once unshakable, was now a storm, and the storm was trying to tear the world apart.

""Yuo... yuo...""  
""Yuo...!""

Losing again?  
AGAIN?!

He couldn't accept it.  
He was losing to people who were taking his home away.

No... losing... because they...  
Why...? Lose?

**\[Kang In Cheon's potential is fighting its limits once more!\]**

“Yuo… yuo…”  
His voice cracked, spit flying with each syllable.  
“Yuo…!”

Losing?  
Again?  
**AGAIN?!**

The word rattled in his skull like a stone in a tin can. He couldn’t accept it.  
Not to them.  
Not to people who were trying to take his home away.

*no… no los... i stron...*

His seven-fingered fists shook, nails biting into his palms. The floor groaned beneath his stance, as if it, too, felt the strain.

No… losing… because they—  
Because they…

*wy? why? wy...?!*

His vision blurred red, every vein crawling like fire under his skin. His breath heaved in short, ragged bursts.

**\[Kang In Cheon’s potential is fighting its limits once more!\]**

**\[Red Ogre is burning!\]**  
**\[Indiscriminate Violence is raging on!\]**  
**\[Kang In Cheon's personality is being tainted.\]**

Kang In roared, the sound bestial, shaking the dust from the cracked walls as he hurled himself toward the duo once more.

“The juggernaut’s coming again,” Seokjun spat, bracing.

**\[Kang In Cheon’s potential is fighting its limits once more!\]**

“Same game then,” Yongjin replied, grit flashing in his grin.

They darted sideways, zig-zagging in tandem. Seokjun spun, his heel snapping like a whip—  
*CRACK!* The kick slammed against Kang In’s temple. The monster’s head twisted—yet even as it did, his arm lurched outward, swinging blindly toward Yongjin.

“Yong!”

“On it!”

Yongjin slipped to the side, dodging as the punch scythed down from above—

Yet this time…

**\[Kang In Cheon’s potential is overcoming its limits!\]**

The fist wasn’t just a strike—it was a paw, a slab of fury that tore the air apart. It grazed him, ripping cloth like paper, and Yongjin’s shirt was shredded clean off his body.

“Haha! Looks like—”

But the laugh was cut short.

*KRAAASH!*

A sweeping uppercut carved across Yongjin’s chest, leaving deep crimson lines where flesh split under the raw density of Kang In’s strength. Blood flecked the air in sharp arcs.

“Yuo…” His voice cracked, guttural, somewhere between a word and a growl.

**\[Kang In Cheon’s personality is being corrupted!\]**  
**\[Kang In Cheon’s potential is struggling to keep up!\]**

“tink… u al dat?” His grin tore wide, lips curled with blood.

**\[Kang In Cheon’s personality has completely corrupted.\]**

Ever since Kang In first picked up fists… it was to protect, wasn’t it? Right?  
A home.  
A place.  
People he didn’t want to see broken.

But somewhere, along the way, things had changed.

Protecting was fine. But the *fights*—the blood in the air, the screams in his ears, the rush pounding in his veins—  
That was better.

*so gud… so fun… so alive…*

They called him a monster. A freak. A genetic mistake wrapped in muscle and black bone. A fighter whose talent others would never touch.

And little by little… he believed it.  
Breaking them wasn’t just survival anymore. It was proof. It was joy.

Bit by bit, he built an ego.  
Bit by bit, he shaped a pride.

He was talented.  
He could win.  
He *would* win.

And losing?

No.  
Impossible.  
That word did not exist.

*I need win.*  
*I WIN.*

Beautiful blond girl with ice blue eyes who was hooking up with a guy friend of mine. One night we all got drunk and had a threesome. It happened a couple more times later and I also met her myself a couple time and we had sex but eventually became just good friends and stopped hooking up other than an occasional bj. We saw eachother alot and became good friends. We used to make funny stickers for each other, for example she sent me a sticker of a cropped pic of her ass and thighs with googly eyes on the buttocks saying ""Thank you!"" And I sent her one of my cock with googly eyes and the shaft as a nose saying something like ""mr penis wishes you a lovely afternoon"" maybe im paraphrasing lol. It was all good fun and had no identifiable details. After a while she met a guy who was super good to her and they became serious and I was supportive and understanding when we drifted appart.
 Anyways I was with a friend a week ago and we bumped into this guy she were into and we all had coffee and he said he's meeting a friend who shortly after joined us. So this guy, Jim, comes and joins us. Jim is a really cool guy, covered in tats, blond haird with beautiful ice blue eyes. I'm bi and i was immediately attracted to him. He had a calming energy about him, and somewhat familiar face... we were talking for hours, about music and life and habits and memes, at one point he asked for my number cause he wanted to share some meme stickers we talked about and he started bombing me with stickers, many of them with a sexual flare to them. I naturally sent him my funniest ones and as I grew short, I added the one with Nina's ass. Which he said 'niiiiiice' to. I did not understand if it's flirting or he's straight and it's just a mutual connection but he really opened up and told me all anout his life and childhood and eventually he talked about his sister, which also lives in the city hut he barely gets to see, and just describing her... it hit me. I asked to see a pic of her. He happily showed me a pic of him and Nina in a family wedding. My heart fell to my underpants. I know her! I told him she's a good friend, and he asked a couple normal question that I really had to work around instead of telling him yea I f++ your sister. I felt the energy was kinda off from that point, and I felt bad but I didnt really know what to do. The next day I suddenly remembered the sticker, and it was too late to delete for both, and I think I remember him saving it anyway. Fuck, I hope she never sees it somehow.

I’ve been lurking here for a while, reading all your flipping success stories, and finally decided to give it a try myself. A few weeks ago, I picked up a used coffee table off Facebook Marketplace for $25. It was a solid piece, just needed a good clean and a bit of polish.
I spent maybe 30 minutes cleaning it up and taking better photos, then relisted it on Marketplace for $80. Got a few lowball offers, but ended up selling it to someone for $75 cash within 4 days.
Not a huge profit, I know, but turning $25 into $75 with barely any work felt amazing. It honestly gave me the confidence to start looking for more items to flip. Already eyeing some used electronics and furniture in my area 👀

The idea is simple: each month, we’re inviting people to explore, record and create music from everyday noises (footsteps, coffee shop conversations, wind at the window, the sounds of a forest path or city street).

It’s completely open—no rules, no experience needed and no fancy gear required. You can use your phone, found sounds, your own voice or instruments. Each week, we’ll share prompts and downloadable sample packs, plus tips for beginners and deeper dives for seasoned creators. You’re welcome to dip in and out, collaborate or just listen.

If you’re curious about field recording, experimental music or are just looking for a community of people who love discovering music in unexpected places, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

* Anyone here ever tried using field recordings in your own music? What’d you make?
* What sounds inspire you most in daily life?
* Would you be interested in weekly music prompts or sharing your recordings?

If you want to know more or get involved, drop a comment or DM me. New challenges start this week.

Looking forward to wandering with you!

1n6hcxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/1n6hcxx/is_there_a_reason_induction_coffee_makers_have/,Is there a reason induction coffee makers have rounded bottoms?,"Hi.

I've been looking to buy an italian-style coffee maker for my induction stove, and every model I've seen has a curved bottom, with no angles at all.

This by itself is not surprising, maybe that's just how modern coffee makers tend to be aesthetically. But what surprised me is that some of them had rounded bottoms but angular tops, [like this](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.thenile.io%2Fr1000%2F8006363007764.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=629209f45fc4f9014e90bd9cf330d3103d9c415b6f19248781e3583b978c2f35). This did surprise me, because it looks quite ugly imho, and it's weird for an appliance of any kind to change style halfway through it. And when I looked again I realized that there were many cases of angular top with a rounded bottom or rounded top and bottom, and there was never an angular bottom.

So of course I'm asking myself, is there a reason for this? Would the EM field of the induction oven bunch up in the vertices or something, and heat the water unevenly or inefficiently?

I know for sure I am not straight. I know my desire for men is real and much much stronger than women. I am a very *emotionally oriented* person, almost demisexual and also due to years of pushing my feelings down I fear I have some level of *health anxiety* too. I never had any sexual connection with men or women. I’m 33 now, in the closet and the problem is despite knowing these things about myself and the fact that I want to explore, I can’t.

The easiest way is hook-ups, but I don’t feel comfortable with that. Finding a more serious relationship also feels difficult.

Ideally I want someone who has the patience to let me learn how things work at my own pace. But I know that’s kind of idealistic and not very likely to happen. I have Tinder and my profile says I’m looking for new friends, and I mention I don’t want to rush into anything. Among the few matches I get, most fade away without even messaging. The ones who do chat quickly ask for my number or social media. I don’t want to stay on the app forever, but I’d like to get to know someone a bit before moving off it. For me, chatting for 2–3 days and then meeting in a coffee shop feels right, and then if it goes well, we can exchange numbers or socials.

I feel like I have two options:

1. Stick to my boundaries and wait until I find the right person.  
2. Change myself, which I don’t even know how to do. Just putting my real pictures on Tinder was already a huge step for me and took me some time to do it.

To be fully honest, sometimes I feel deep down I’m still afraid of being gay. I see a guy who’s cute and lovely and I can imagine being with him, but if it starts to feel real, I panic. **But** when I set my Tinder to women, it’s different. I see their faces and, while they’re pretty and nice, I feel scared in another way, like I can’t do it, like it would be strange.

With men, I feel more excited, more interested, more sexual, but I can’t get close. With women, I do feel some sexual attraction (very dependent on the person) , notice their beauty, or feel the energy, but I don’t know how to relate to it. I’m afraid that if I keep denying my true self and I probably somehow find a woman I can connect with, one day my desire for men will blow everything up.

That probably sounds like overthinking, but it’s all over my thoughts.

***So I’m kind of stuck. Do I dive in blind and risk hurting myself? Or do I wait for the rare person who can walk with me at my pace? Or is there some middle ground I can’t see right now?***

*Btw*, I am originally from the middle east (with all the traditional family and religious society challenges ) but moved to the EU for my PhD about a year ago. Since then, I tried reddit and Tinder to chat with guys and kinda fit myself in the community somehow, or at least not to stand idle. I realized there are very few guys online with mutual interests who are willing to be just friends (at least at first) and I can’t blame them. 

Also, I am living in a small student town, there is no gay bar and the university has limited LGBT activities and those are usually filled with teens. I would probably feel alienated there, IF I can convince myself to go! also that affect the apps too! 

**TL;DR:** I’m in my 30s, closeted, emotionally cautious, and have never had sex. I know I’m primarily attracted to men, but fear, past suppression, and a small social circle make exploring difficult. Hook-ups feel wrong, serious dating seems rare, and I don’t know how to start building gay life at my own pace. I would appreciate advice for safe, gradual explorations.",2,1756813511.0,askgaybros,2,1.0,False

With its promise of being a heavy-duty cleaner as well as a disinfectant, it seemed like the ideal product to tackle stubborn spots and sanitize surfaces. Naturally, I went straight to the kitchen and bathroom for a real test drive. Let’s just say I got a good sense of how well this product performs in some of the most challenging spots in the house.

**Impressive Cleaning Power**

The first thing I noticed was the remarkable effectiveness of this disinfectant spray. After spraying it on greasy kitchen counters and letting it sit for a minute or two, I wiped the surfaces clean with ease. It didn’t just smudge the grime around; it eliminated it entirely. Even those weird, sticky stains under the coffee maker that seem to resist every other cleaner disappeared like magic. It’s clear that this product was designed for tough jobs, and I didn’t have to go over problem areas multiple times to see results. Honestly, it cuts through grease better than any generic spray I've used before. For someone who cooks a lot, that’s a game-changer.

[Check ITW Global Brands 26832 price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b07p1ckgsh/)

**Versatility Across Surfaces**

One of the highlights for me was how many surfaces this spray can handle. I tested it on stainless steel, tiles, plastic, and even my kids’ muddy sports gear, and it performed consistently well. It didn’t leave streaks on shiny surfaces, which is usually an issue with many other cleaners. The best part? It’s also effective on car interiors, so I gave our family car's dashboard and seats a thorough wipe-down. Now everything looks and smells fresh. That level of versatility saves me from buying separate cleaners for different areas, which is a big plus for minimalists like me.

**Ease of Use and Packaging**

The spray nozzle on the bottle makes application convenient, and the 32-ounce size feels generous without being so bulky that it’s hard to handle. Several products I’ve tried in the past either have poorly designed nozzles that make spraying uneven or bottles that are too heavy, but this one had none of those issues. It’s a well-thought-out design that makes the cleaning process straightforward. However, I did notice that the bottle can drip slightly if tilted too much, which isn’t ideal if you're trying to get into tight spots.

**Strengths**

- Exceptional at cutting through grease and grime  
- Works well on multiple surfaces, including stainless steel, plastic, and tile  
- Eliminates odors effectively, leaving a clean, fresh scent behind  
- Large 32-ounce bottle lasts through many cleaning sessions  

**Areas for Improvement**

- Nozzle may drip if tilted too much during use  
- The scent, while clean, might be a bit strong for those sensitive to fragrances  

**Competing Products**

When comparing this spray to other well-known disinfectants, like Lysol or Clorox sprays, its versatility and cleaning power definitely stand out. For instance, while Lysol is excellent for general disinfecting, it doesn’t always handle grease as effectively. Clorox often leaves streaks on mirrors and glassy surfaces in my experience, which Spray Nine doesn’t do. However, both competitors typically have more ergonomic bottles that are less prone to dripping, which is an area where this product could improve. That said, if you’re tackling a combination of grime, germs, and stubborn stains, this cleaner is probably more reliable than its alternatives.

**Affordable Quality**

Looking at how many purposes this one spray fulfills—cleaning, degreasing, and disinfecting—it offers fantastic cost-efficiency. This single product replaces at least two or three cleaners I would typically have to purchase separately. If you’re someone who values practical, multipurpose cleaning solutions, it’s worth every penny. Plus, considering how little product is needed for heavy cleaning, the 32-ounce bottle is likely to last months. It’s not just budget-friendly; it feels like a long-term investment in easier cleaning routines.

We shop, work, and socialize online, often without a second thought. But with this convenience comes a growing need to protect our personal information. Your digital footprint—the trail of data you leave behind online—can be a roadmap to your life. The good news is that taking control of your digital privacy isn't a complex task. By implementing a few simple habits, you can significantly reduce your risk and gain peace of mind.



# Your Digital Privacy Checklist: 6 Essential Steps



1. Strengthen Your Passwords

Your passwords are the first line of defense for your online accounts. Stop using the same password for multiple sites. Instead, create strong, unique passwords that are at least 12 characters long and include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. A password manager is an excellent tool to securely generate and store these complex passwords for you.

2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second piece of information (like a code sent to your phone) in addition to your password. Even if someone steals your password, they can't access your account without that second code. Enable 2FA on every account that offers it—especially for your email, banking, and social media.

3. Be Smart on Social Media

Social media is designed for sharing, but you have control over how much you reveal. Take a few minutes to review your privacy settings on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Limit who can see your posts, photos, and personal information. Also, be cautious of accepting friend requests from people you don't know in real life.

4. Review App Permissions

When you download a new app, it often asks for access to your camera, microphone, contacts, or location. Many apps request more access than they actually need to function. Go into your phone's settings and review which apps have permissions for your data. Revoke access for any app that doesn't need it.

5. Be Wary of Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks in coffee shops, airports, and hotels are often unsecured. This means your data is vulnerable to being intercepted by others on the same network. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts (like your online banking) when on public Wi-Fi. If you must use it, consider a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which encrypts your internet traffic.

6. Watch Out for Phishing

Phishing is a cybercrime where scammers send fraudulent emails or text messages that look legitimate to trick you into revealing personal information. Be skeptical of messages asking for your password, account details, or banking information. Never click on suspicious links or download attachments from an unknown sender.

Taking control of your digital privacy is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix. By making these few simple habits a part of your routine, you can build a more secure digital life and protect the information that matters most.",1,1756813248.0,u_iwaachghadir,0,1.0,False

But I'm sick of paying higher and higher prices. So I've started going to McDonald's and Greggs. Atmosphere is a little ghetto but the coffee is the same but half the price.

1n6h39i,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamerPals/comments/1n6h39i/33_f_pst_looking_for_a_duo_with_a_sleeping/,33 F PST - Looking for a duo with a sleeping schedule as messed up as mine.,"Hello, (possible?) new friend! Now first, a quick disclaimer:

**Before you message me, please know that I am looking for someone who is up late at night (or maybe in another area where the night here is day there or something), like I am. It's harder for me to retain friendships with people that are up during the day and want to play at that time or the early evening because I usually work those hours and take naps and/or time for myself during that time. It's nothing against you, and I am sure you are lovely, I just know that we will have a harder time building a friendship and I don't want to waste your time or make you feel neglected. <3 Take care of yourself, drink your water and enjoy life! I'm rooting for you.** 

I am PST time zone, but honestly if you're from overseas or like, just have a real terrible sleeping schedule, we should get along great! I'm up and alone in the middle of the night for hours, so it'd be nice to find a fellow gremlin of the night. 

**A lil' bit about me, the boring stuff**:

I'm 33, from California, hate it here. I do tech support during the day for work. How do I manage it with my sleep being this terrible? Celsius, coffee and pure spite. I live a pretty boring life, and I mostly like it that way. But I'm pretty lonely, so that's why I'm posting here. <3 

**A lil bout the games I play**:

I mostly play co-op survival games these days, sometimes something cozy, sometimes a lil' Rivals or Overwatch to get my aggression out, but usually, I'm a pretty wholesome gamer. I have PC, PS5 & Switch. 

**Some games I'd love to play with you**: 

No Man's Sky, 7 Days To Die, Once Human, Palia, Enshrouded, Valheim, V-Rising, Core Keeper, Don't Starve Together, Palworld, Terraria, Minecraft, Luma Island, Coral Island, Stardew Valley, The Forest, Sons of the Forest, Phasmophobia, Abiotic Factor, Project Zomboid, Peak, Dead By Daylight (I've barely played but would play it if you help me learn the ropes!). 

I also play this game called The First Descendent that hardly anyone plays, but if you do, that'd be great!

I'll try other games too! I am pretty open minded, I just usually avoid FPS and Moba (No CS, Valo or League, I'm afraid) 

**Music, Anime, etc**:

For music, I love EDM, Metalcore, Hyperpop, K-Pop and just about every other genre besides Country. 

For anime, I would like to watch more, and am pretty open to most kinds so long as it can make me laugh.

I also enjoy films a lot, really a huge fan of horror, thriller and suspenseful films, but I like a wide variety of stuff here too. (We can trade Letterboxd accounts if you'd like!)

Thank you for reading, and I hope to hear from you. If not, good luck to you!

1n6h133,https://rynk.app,Ever wished you could grab coffee with that witty redditor from this sub? Built something for that...,"Hey r/BangaloreMeetups !   
  
Like many of you, I've had amazing discussions here and often thought ""I wish I could grab coffee with this person."" Turns out, many interesting Redditors are probably living just a few kilometers away from us.   
  
So I built Rynk - think of it as a way to connect with fellow Redditors in your neighborhood for real-world friendships.  
  
How it works:  
• The app analyzes your Reddit history to create a genuine personality profile  
• Shows you compatible people nearby (Bangalore area to start)  
• Send connection requests to people who seem interesting (also view them by age group)  
• Chat securely on the platform if they accept  
  
Privacy first:  
• Only uses your first name and general location  
• End-to-end encrypted messaging (WhatsApp level security)  
• Your Reddit username stays anonymous unless you choose to share  
  
I'm launching the beta today and keeping it free while gathering feedback. Would love to hear what you think - especially from fellow Bangaloreans who've wanted to turn online connections into real friendships.  
  
Anyone interested in trying it out? Happy to answer questions here or via DM.

We were together since we were 15 and I’m 22 now. Seven years. For seven years, he was my first and only love, and now he’s gone.

It wasn’t a healthy relationship, I’ll be honest about that. We were both carrying way too much. I’ve been dealing with chronic pain, fatigue, and mental health issues like BPD, depression, autism and most days I was barely holding myself together. It made me lash out, push him away, snap at him, or just shut down completely. He had his own issues too. He struggled with anger, he had an attitude, and when he felt overwhelmed he’d shut down on me or throw things back at me in ways that really hurt. Neither of us knew how to handle it and it was a constant cycle for the last 2 or 3 years.

We had these huge blowout fights at least once a month. They’d get loud, messy, full of all the worst things we could throw at each other. And yet, after every fight, we always found a way back to each other. Until this time.

The last fight was brutal. We screamed, said awful things, hit each other (We had both done this before, I just think I was the worse about it most times) and instead of cooling off, he called his parents. Before he left, he told me he hated me and didn’t like me anymore. Then he walked out and blocked me everywhere. And just like that, our seven years together were gone in one night.

I can’t stop replaying it. Not just that fight, but all of them. And the good moments too. The nights we laughed, the times I felt like he was the only person in the world who understood me. He had these hazel eyes I can’t get out of my head. He wanted to be a teacher because he genuinely wanted to make a difference. I know he cared, even if we didn’t show it right.

Since he left, I can’t function. I can’t eat. Everything makes me sick. I’ve been living off water and sips of coffee. And sleep doesn’t help, I just wake up every couple of hours, and when I do sleep, I dream about him. Sometimes we’re happy, sometimes I’m begging him not to walk away, but he always leaves at some point. I wake up heartbroken every time and have to take the next few hours crying.

I know we weren’t good for each other in the end. I know I hurt him, and he hurt me. But he was still my only person. My first, my only. And now I don’t know how to picture life without him. People say time heals, but right now it feels endless and infinite.

I’ve been trying to make friends, because I literally had no one but him. I’m trying to leave the house more and find a job that I can do with my health issues. I want to become my own person. But, right now, my heart is just begging for him to come back even if my head knows that’ll never happen and probably shouldn’t.

Hair, makeup, clothes, even the way you drink your coffee can become part of an “aesthetic.”

I don’t really get it. Why is there always this push to belong to a style, instead of just living the way you want? Is it about identity, status, or just wanting to look put-together? Sometimes it feels like people spend more energy curating an image than actually enjoying their lives.

But I’m having a serious issue with him constantly crossing my boundaries.","We have been broken up for almost 10 years. No matter how many times I tell him no, whether calmly or cussing him out, he still tries to be sexual with me, hugs me too long, kisses me, or overstays his welcome when he drops my daughter off. It is very annoying and disrespectful.

Lately it feels like he is also putting ideas in my daughter’s head. She will ask if he can spend the night and they both laugh like it is funny. Yesterday he helped me move the last bit of my stuff, and even though we were done at 6 PM, he did not leave until almost 9. Later, I found out that while I was outside having coffee, he and my daughter were laying in my bed taking pictures together like it was some kind of joke. That made me really upset, but they brushed it off.

I feel like he is trying to paint this “big happy family” picture in her mind when that is not the reality. She does not know the history between us, all the turmoil, the messy breakup, the custody and child support battles, and she should not. She is just a kid. But she is old enough to know that some things are not okay.

I have explained to her that we are a family because we both love her, but not in the way she is imagining. He will never live with me, we are not together, and he is not my boyfriend. I do not want to bash him to her or drag her into grown folks’ business, but I also need her to understand boundaries, like people not being in my bed without permission.

Part of me feels like he is only doing this because he is single now, grieving his mom’s recent passing, and has nowhere else to go. Back when he had a girlfriend, he treated me badly and was not friendly at all. It was only after his breakup and his mom’s death that he started being extra persistent, but at the point of being disrespectful.

It is frustrating because it took us years to get to a point where we could even be friends after everything we went through. And now he is making it impossible to even have that friendship because he keeps crossing the line.

So why would the crypto space be the same?

At the end of the day:

**For time and the world do not stand still.** **Change is the law of life.And those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future - JFK**

The greatest performers this cycle will not be those who have stood still and failed to build on the foundations laid before us by the greats(Shib, Doge etc). They will be those who have revolutionised the space like those before them, those who have made unprecedented progress in new and more diverse directions.

Kendu is not ignoring social media, in fact we are easily top 5 projects in terms of social media output, our Reddit efforts are unparalleled, our X efforts are up there with very best and we are also the leader on Stocktwits.

Certik also agrees...Certik is a very reputable organisation and rates Kendu's community strength at 92/100, whilst other projects like SPX, MOG, Giga, Fartcoin,PNUT, Apu and Pepe... are all below 90. The only other community I have seen over 90 is Shib.

Kendu is doing all of this below 20 million market cap, in terms of future price action I believe that we are pre pump Shib, the pressure is building and we are dying to shoot off.

**Social Media efforts alone would make Kendu special but we do not stop there...**

Kendu has evolved into a brandcoin, yes we started off as just a memecoin but thanks to Kendu Energy and Kendu Coffee, we started infiltrating real life industries. These had a massive knock on effect and we have expanded to way more than just 2 IRL efforts, we now have over 15!

These are all done by the average holder which is even more insane. Imagine how crazy things will get when our market cap is in the hundreds of millions or the billions, there will be a tsunami of efforts as people have more and more money to invest into their passions.

Whilst AI is making pretty scary progress, Kendu is using IRL efforts to show **Proof Of Humanity**, this cannot be replicated and is very important imo.

1n6gl4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_iwaachghadir/comments/1n6gl4l/the_power_of_connection_a_guide_to_authentic/,The Power of Connection: A Guide to Authentic Professional Networking,"For many, the word ""networking"" conjures images of forced conversations in a crowded room, exchanging business cards with strangers, and the uncomfortable feeling of ""What can this person do for me?"" But true networking is the opposite of this transactional approach. At its core, it is the simple, human process of building genuine relationships with people who share your interests, passions, and professional goals. A strong network is a safety net, a sounding board, and a source of endless opportunity.



# Your Foundational Principles for Authentic Networking



**1. It's About Giving, Not Taking**

The most common mistake in networking is to approach it with a ""what can I get?"" mindset. The most successful networkers operate with a ""what can I give?"" philosophy. Offer to connect two people you know, share an article that might be useful to a contact, or simply offer a word of encouragement. By being a valuable resource to others without expecting anything in return, you build a foundation of trust that is far more powerful than any a favor you might ask for.

**2. Quality Over Quantity**

You don’t need a network of thousands of LinkedIn contacts. What you need is a core group of a few dozen people who know you well and genuinely want to see you succeed. Focus on building meaningful, deep relationships. This means investing your time in a few conversations where you can truly get to know the other person on a personal and professional level, rather than trying to meet as many people as possible.

**3. Be Prepared to Listen**

The best way to build a connection is to show genuine curiosity. Instead of talking about yourself, ask open-ended questions about the other person’s work, their challenges, and their career path. Active listening—really hearing what the other person is saying—shows respect and makes the conversation a two-way street. People are naturally drawn to those who are interested in them.

**4. Nurture Your Connections**

Networking is not a one-time event; it is a continuous practice of nurturing relationships. Don't wait until you need something to reach out. Send a simple message to check in, share a relevant article you found, or congratulate them on a recent accomplishment. These small acts of communication keep your network active and your relationships strong over time.

**5. Find Your Comfort Zone**

Networking doesn’t have to happen at formal events. Find places where you can connect with people in a way that feels natural to you. This might be through volunteering for a cause you care about, joining an online community related to your industry, or simply asking a colleague for a brief coffee chat. Authentic connections are often formed in comfortable, low-pressure environments.

Networking, at its best, is simply a commitment to being a good human being who is genuinely interested in others. By shifting your mindset from a transactional chore to an act of building community, you will not only grow your professional opportunities but also enrich your life with meaningful connections.",1,1756811382.0,u_iwaachghadir,0,1.0,False

Hello everyone! I'm a junior EE student attending a university in Massachusetts. I recently started my internship search, but I can't help but feel like my resume is so weak. I've been mostly targeting hardware, validation, and embedded roles but I feel very unqualified for any internship I apply to whether its a start up or a fortune 500 company. Most of the jobs have been local in the Boston area. I've also have been applying for Co-ops, this is actually what I would prefer to have. I really want the opportunity to be more hands on, and have someone mentor me.

What can I do to improve? I know my resume has weaknesses, but I have no clue where to start improving. I would love some feedback! Also, I wanted to know if I was behind? I look at other peoples resumes and I get a sense of inferiority. People with ""better"" resumes than me are having so much trouble finding internships. Really stressing me out :p

I’m curious about how these tools, especially humanizers, tweak AI text to feel more natural. Let’s chat about what’s out there and how they fit into the writing process, e?

**Why it matters right now:**  
  
With AI writing becoming a go-to for brainstorming or first drafts, a lot of us are noticing that raw output can feel stiff or get flagged by automated classifiers. Humanizer tools aim to smooth out that robotic vibe while keeping the core ideas intact. It’s handy for blogs, social posts, or even just internal docs.

Tactics to understand AI humanizers:

* **Purpose Check:** Most humanizers focus on adjusting sentence rhythm and word choice to reduce patterns that trip up screening models. They’re not magic, just a polish layer.
* **Workflow Fit:** Pair them with a base AI writer like ChatGPT or Claude for raw content, then run a refinement pass to add a more conversational touch.
* **Manual Backup:** Even with tools, a quick read-aloud pass can catch awkward phrasing that tech misses. If it doesn’t sound like something you’d say over coffee, tweak it.
* **Tool Variety:** There’s a growing list of options, each with a slightly different spin on refining text. I’ve come across a few worth exploring (see below).

Quick List of AI Humanizers I’ve Found:  
  
Here’s a rundown of tools that aim to naturalize AI-generated text. I’m not endorsing any, just sharing what’s out there based on my research and some trial runs:

* [GPT Scrambler](https://gptscrambler.com/en): A straightforward option that keeps formatting like paragraphs intact while focusing on cadence adjustments.
* [Undetectable AI](https://undetectable.ai): Claims to rework text to lower the likelihood of being over-labeled by pattern scorers.
* [AIHumanize](https://aihumanize.com): Offers a range of tone adjustments to make drafts sound less mechanical.
* [StealthWriter](https://stealthwriter.ai): Focuses on long-form content with an emphasis on maintaining context during refinement.
* [HumanizeAI](https://humanizeai.io): Another player that tweaks phrasing for a more lived-in feel.

Mini Example:  
  
Before: The product offers benefits to users by improving efficiency.  
  
After, post-humanizer +quick manual edit): This tool saved me a good 10 minutes on my last report by streamlining the workflow.  
  
Just a small shift, but it feels less like a template, right?

But for the future I'd like to focus on building more muscles and overall health.

My workout routine:

3-4x per week, in a day I do 5 exercises, 3 sets per each.

Day 2: Back, shoulders, biceps, 6% incline walk 45min  
Day 3: Core, 6% incline walk 45min  
Day 4: Legs

I manage to get at least 10k steps per day (my average monthly is 12k - gym cardio is included here). In mid September I plan to start running back again 1-2x per week, as in the summer it's too hot to run outside.

I eat quite healthy - plenty of veggies and fruits, eggs, chia, oatmeal, meat (chicken, beef), a lot of cottage cheese. I also eat 20g of dark chocolate every day and go out for an ice cream scoop 1-2 per week. I only drink water, coffee and natural lemonade. I do struggle to eat over 60g of protein per day...

The key question is: just show up, or use every opportunity to expand your network and gain maximum value?

Conferences are not just about booths, speeches, and afterparties. They are a concentrated source of opportunities: a place to collect dozens of contacts, insights, and ideas for growth. The main thing is to understand the rules of the game and make use of every opportunity. That’s why the [N1 Partners](https://n1.partners?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=link_building&utm_campaign=generic&utm_term=global&utm_content=english) team has put together this guide — to help you stand out among hundreds of participants, build productive connections, and turn meetings into real business opportunities.

# Event Must-Have List

To make your day productive, you need to be ready for a busy pace:

\- smartphone and charger  
\- comfortable shoes — you’ll be walking a lot  
\- power bank (better two, to last the whole day)  
\- water and a snack — sometimes you won’t have time for a proper meal  
\- business cards and your meeting list  
\- mobile internet (eSIM), since Wi-Fi at events is often unreliable

Back then, I really thought it was the right decision, but now I see that instead of running away, I should have looked inward, pulled myself together, and made you the happiest partner in the world. Of course, I saw even back then how much you meant to me, and I loved you, but this is different now. This time I really lost you, and the emptiness you left is unbearable.

Now I love you in the way you always wanted me to. Every little thing about you has become priceless to me – even the smallest gesture or silly move. Your sleepy little mornings, your sad call for coffee, everything. You once told me that you would silently listen to my stories – now I crave to hear yours: about your game characters, about what your horoscope said, or why your friend scolded you that day.

Right now, I would throw away everything just to sit with you again, even for the worst movie ever, just to blow out the candle and wish each other good night in that cocoa-lotion scent on a cold November evening. I’d love to hear about your first university days, your classes, to introduce you as my girlfriend at a Christmas dinner, to have you at my graduation, to come home from work to you and just hug you.

I wanted to take you to the zoo, to mini-golf again, to the movies, restaurants, etc. So many places. But I had no motivation, and now I see that I didn’t recognize how strong the bond between us really was. I thought maybe this was about my ego, or that I was bothered by the type of guy you’re with now – but no, this is about you.

You had everything I wanted, but I couldn’t value it. Maybe I was afraid of committing fully and being left behind. Now I feel anger at the world, at myself, and deep longing for you, all mixed together. You’re wonderful, and I wish we could both start over, with new trust and forgiveness.

I understand everything you did, and I don’t hold it against you. I know I got lazy in the relationship, I messed it up. I just needed to let this out, like you once let your feelings out in a long message. If I tell you all this and you reject me, I won’t try again, no matter how much I want you back.

I’m sorry for hurting you so much. I once said I wished I could take some of your pain – I feel that even stronger now. I couldn’t deal with my problems, so instead I pushed you away. I’m sorry for leaving you that day, with tears on your face.

You’re the best thing that ever happened to me, despite all the bad. Thank you for teaching me how to love, how to value the smallest things – like when you made me toast at 2am – things I should have given everything for.

I love you. If our paths never cross again, know that you’ll always be a memory I’ll never forget. You’re wonderful, never let anyone convince you otherwise like I sadly did. I wish you happiness, with or without me.

Anything I said or did recently was out of anger at myself, not at you or him. Please forgive me if this sounds overly cheesy – it’s not my usual style, but it’s still me, and I can’t hold it in.

Day 2:
This is the second message I’m writing. I’m afraid the impact of these will wear off, but last night it helped me a lot to bring my emotions to the surface, so I’m trying again.

I feel like a little kid, honestly, I’m completely falling apart. I’m so confused, my emotions keep changing constantly. Sometimes I’m angry – not at you, but at myself, for leaving you. Sometimes I’m angry at my environment, for the patterns I learned that kept me from realizing sooner how much I loved you, how deeply I was attached to you, even if it wasn’t in the way I thought love was supposed to feel.

One thing is certain: the feeling I have now is the same as before, maybe even stronger. You’d probably be glad to hear that.

My first message and this one are very different. I’m writing this one because it helps me accept that my emotions are all over the place. I can accept that it’s natural, but it’s very painful. I feel torn between losing you, realizing I couldn’t see your true value, and facing how unstable I am. I thought I could handle anything on my own. Now I see I can – but it’s so hard. I’m disappointed in myself, I thought I’d handle this pain better.

At the same time, I’m broken over how little I love myself, how average I see myself, how empty I feel without you. I wish you were here, but I feel like you’ve truly moved on. Maybe you’re angry at me, or annoyed, or maybe it was just the influence of that guy being around yesterday – but still, your coldness hurt me badly.

It hurts that even though I left you, I was always there for you with love, and now you’ve completely abandoned me. I know it’s justified and understandable, but it’s very painful, and I’m trying to accept it.

I still feel like I won’t find another girl like you (though not much time has passed, haha). I’m not going to start over – I’ve already said everything. I know there are so many amazing girls out there, but for a while I won’t be able to connect. I feel emptiness inside me, like a piece of me is missing.

I don’t want to keep punishing myself, but now I understand what I did to you. This pain feels like someone ripped a piece out of me and left me to bleed.

I’m sorry. I love you so much. I wish you the greatest happiness. That’s all I can do.",0,1756810603.0,letters,1,0.33,False

	•	Dad jokes (the good and the groan-worthy)
	•	A solid plan for a porch, a fishing spot, and a simple life that’s still full of fun

1n6gc5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1n6gc5p/tweaked_things_and_seeing_changes/,Tweaked things and seeing changes!,"So I started my weight loss and Loseit journey in December 2023. Lost 35 pounds by January of 2025. Then had major work stress and it took me down, or I should say up 12 pounds. I finally got my head on straight and have started over. 

What I used to do was loosely follow Mediterranean plan but allow some small sweets most days. That worked but slowed to a crawl. I had to adjust my calories at the original midpoint to keep losing but it did slow quite a bit.

I have changed up everything now and getting great results this first two weeks!  Still tracking and still using Loseit but here is my new plan:

I eat 30-50 grams of clean protein for breakfast such as; eggs, egg whites, turkey bacon w no nitrates, minimally processed, whey protein that is no casein, and berries or melon. 

At least three times a week I eat sardines, salmon or skipjack tuna in olive oil for the omega 3 for lunch or dinner. 

I eat ground turkey chicken and grass fed beef and lots of veggies and fruits small amounts of rice or hero bread.

My afternoon snack is either a whey shake w organic coconut milk or rice cakes w natural peanut butter, and everyday I eat an unreal chocolate for my sweet tooth. 

I have my two cups of coffee w real grass fed half and half in the morning and drink 104 oz of water daily and have decaf hot tea the rest of the day.

I have lost five pounds, sleeping better, arthritic pain is almost gone, and what’s odd is my food noise has tamped down considerably. 

The heavy protein in the morning keeps me satiated and crave free unless I eat something processed. This was tested because I bought my husband a gorgeous birthday cake. I had also gone on an errand in another town and didn’t bring a snack so I got very hungry in the afternoon , I went to McDonalds and got a filet of fish, fries and an apple pie. 

While I did the McDonalds, I didn’t overeat and had I not eaten anything else that day would have stayed in a deficit. But oh you know I did eat more!

The food noise came back with a vengeance and that birthday cake was screaming in my head! I managed to eat a small sliver of a piece and went to bed. My stomach was upset over it all too. 

What was the difference? 
Processed McDonalds food. Eating rich birthday cake when I had gotten all that mess out of my system. 

 I’m Back to my clean eating and everything is calm again. Not being harsh or terribly restrictive but 1200-1400 calories for me eating this way is not hard at all. 

Just wanted to share what is happening for me.

Are you still manually...

Sorting through hundreds of emails?

Copying and pasting data into spreadsheets?

Spending HOURS researching for a single blog post?

Imagine having an AI assistant that does it all for you, 24/7, without ever needing a coffee break. 🤖

I build custom AI ‘employees’ that handle the tasks you hate, so you can focus on growing your business.

For example, I built two AI agents that are complete game-changers:

1️⃣ The ""Get It Done"" Personal Assistant:
It works from a simple chat message. You can tell it to:
✅ Find the 3 cheapest flights for your next trip and put it on your calendar.
✅ Read your emails and write a reply.
✅ Log your business expenses automatically.

2️⃣ The ""Deep Research"" Agent:
Give it a topic, and it will:
✅ Scour the internet for expert-level info.
✅ Write a fully researched report with citations.
✅ Save it all in a Google Doc for you.

This means you can get back HOURS every single week. More time for clients, more time for strategy, more time for YOU. 🚀

So, my question for you is…

What’s the #1 task you would give to an AI assistant RIGHT NOW? Drop your answer in the comments! 👇

1n6g96c,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1n6g96c/the_last_shift_at_black_hollow_diner/,The LAST Shift at Black Hollow Diner,"That night at the Black Hollow Diner started like any other, but from the moment I stepped onto the greasy floor behind the counter, something felt off. The wall clock read 2:47. I washed dishes, poured coffee, wiped down tables, but when I looked up again, the hands hadn't moved. I blinked, rubbed my eyes, even gave the glass a light tap, but time seemed frozen inside that dusty circle.

The silence in the restaurant was suffocating. The deep fryer, which always sizzled without stopping, seemed to have fallen asleep, as if someone had turned down the volume of the world. The neon lights flickered, casting fractured shadows across the peeling walls. In the corner, the old jukebox, unplugged for months, let out a low hum, so constant it sounded like a slow breath. I met its gaze more than once, certain that if I looked for too long, I’d see someone reflected in the glass.

Outside, the highway cutting through the Nevada desert was deserted. On other nights, I’d see headlights passing, trucks rolling along, but that night there was nothing. Just darkness. The parking lot was empty, and the desert’s silence seemed to have swallowed even the crickets.

I pulled my apron tighter around me and took a deep breath, but the feeling wouldn't go away. It was my last night there, my final shift at the Black Hollow Diner, and yet I felt like the clock, the jukebox, and even the lights knew something I didn't. Everything was still at 2:47. As if time had chosen to trap me forever in that place.

\*\*\*

I always knew working the graveyard shift wasn't for everyone. When I arrived in the States, fresh out of London with a cheap suitcase and an English accent so thick you could cut it with a knife, the job at the Black Hollow Diner seemed like a quick way to pay the bills. It wasn't glamorous, but it was simple: pour coffee, heat up stale pies, and listen to the stories of tired truckers. For someone still adjusting to a new country, it seemed almost too easy.

The Black Hollow Diner had the air of a place forgotten by time. The tables were covered in stained plastic tablecloths, the blinds rattled when the wind blew, and the neon sign hummed with an irritating buzz, repeating the phrase Always Open over and over. I used to laugh at that—""always open,"" as if anyone would actually want to stop there in the middle of the night. But the truth was, somehow, people always showed up.

The routine was predictable. Around midnight, a few drunk college kids would stumble in, laughing loudly and ordering greasy burgers they almost never finished. Later, around 1:00 AM, the truckers would arrive. They’d take up the counter seats, order black coffee, and say little. The sound of silverware on plates and their low, drawn-out conversations would break the heavy silence of the night. After 2:00 AM, it was almost always just me, the manager, and some lost soul.

The manager, Mr. Daley, was a man who seemed to have been born tired. His face always had the same haggard expression, and he limited himself to smoking behind the counter and counting cash. My first week, I tried to make conversation with him, but the only thing I got was, “Kid, if you wanna last here, learn not to ask too many questions. Especially between 2 and 3 in the morning.” I laughed it off, thinking it was just dry humor, but he didn't smile.

Despite the exhaustion, there was something reassuring about the repetition of that routine. The creak of the door when a customer entered, the jingle of the bell above the entrance, the constant smell of reheated coffee... it all created a sense of stability. A normality that, however tedious, made me feel like I'd found some kind of footing in a strange country.

But even this normality had its unsettling details. The lights in the hallway leading to the bathroom would fail every night, always flickering as if someone was passing by. The jukebox in the corner, unplugged for years, would emit low noises, as if it held music trapped inside. And sometimes, when the restaurant was completely empty, I'd swear I heard the scrape of a chair coming from the booth by the window, even though no one was ever sitting there.

I tried to ignore it all. I told myself it was just exhaustion, loneliness, or my imagination. The problem was that in the last week, those small details had begun to repeat with a disturbing precision. And on that night, my final one, the routine that once seemed so ordinary would transform into something I could never forget.

\*\*\*

The night was dragging on, and the wall clock still showed 2:47. I tried to ignore it, but with every glance, I felt a pang of unease. Mr. Daley had gone to the back, probably to sleep on a pile of boxes like he usually did, and I was alone in the dining area. The Black Hollow Diner seemed quieter than ever, as if the air had become too heavy to move.

That's when the door opened. The bell jingled, but the sound echoed in a strange, prolonged way, as if it wasn't just a regular warning. A man came in and paused for a moment in the doorway, as if he wanted to size the place up. I'd never seen him before. He wore simple clothes, like any trucker, but his jeans were too worn, and his flannel jacket looked like it was from another decade.

He didn’t say anything. He just walked to a corner booth by the window. Many customers had sat there over the months, but this particular booth carried its own strangeness, as if it were waiting for someone specific. The man settled in, and I, trying to be professional, grabbed my notepad and approached.

“Good evening. What can I get for you?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

He slowly raised his gaze. His eyes were dark and deep, but there was no light in them. Just emptiness. “Black coffee,” he replied in a low voice, almost a whisper.

I nodded and went to the machine. When I came back with the steaming cup, I realized he hadn't taken his eyes off me for a second. I placed the coffee on the table and stepped back. He didn't even move to touch the cup. He just sat there, still, watching.

I went back to the counter and tried to distract myself by wiping glasses, but the feeling of being watched wouldn't go away. After a few minutes, I risked a glance at the booth. The man was still there, motionless. The coffee was untouched. I looked at the clock, and my stomach churned: it was still 2:47.

The silence was broken by a sound that made me freeze. The jukebox, unplugged and covered in dust, let out a solitary note, as if someone had pressed a button. I looked at the machine and then at the booth. The man hadn't moved, but his lips curled into what looked like a smile—a joyless smile, just a strange reflection.

I tried to convince myself it was fatigue, that I was imagining things. But when I looked at the coffee again, I noticed that the steam had vanished, as if the drink had been there for hours. And still, the man hadn’t touched it.

I backed away, trying to stay calm, but something inside me was screaming: this night had changed. I couldn’t explain how or why, but the Black Hollow Diner wasn't the same since that man had walked through the door.

\*\*\*

That night, the man's presence in the booth seemed endless. I moved around the diner, trying to act normal, but every time I looked at the clock, it was still 2:47. I could wipe down tables, scrub the counter, even wash the pile of greasy dishes in the kitchen—and when I came back, the hands were in the exact same place. It was as if I were trapped in a single moment that repeated without rest.

I thought about talking to Mr. Daley, but when I knocked on the back door, there was no answer. I pushed the door open and saw only an empty chair and a forgotten mug. It was as if he had simply vanished. My chest tightened, but I went back to the dining area, telling myself he was probably outside smoking. Still, I never heard the door open at all.

The man remained motionless in the booth. The coffee in front of him looked cold now, but not once did his fingers move toward the cup. He just watched me. Not in a hostile way, but with that disturbing calm, as if he had an infinite amount of time to wait.

It was then that I noticed another strange detail. The window glass next to him reflected the diner's interior. I could see the reflection of the lights, the chairs, even myself behind the counter. But his booth was empty in the reflection. There was no body, no face. Just the cup on the table.

My heart pounded. I blinked several times, rubbed my eyes, but nothing changed: the reflected booth was empty. When I looked back at the real table, there he was, in the same way, staring at me.

Suddenly, the jukebox screeched, as if someone had dragged a needle across a record. And then it began to play an old song, something from the 50s, but the voice was distorted, too slow, almost unrecognizable. The melody filled the air like a high-pitched buzz, making the windows tremble. I ran to the jukebox and yanked the plug out of the wall, but the music didn't stop. The machine kept vibrating on its own, spitting out broken notes that echoed through the empty hall.

The air inside the diner felt heavier, suffocating. I walked to the door to go out and get some fresh air, but when I pushed, it wouldn't give. I tried again, with more force, but the doorknob turned loosely, as if it wasn't connected to anything. I looked through the door's window, expecting to see the parking lot lit by the neon sign, but all I saw was darkness, a black void that seemed to stretch on forever.

I stumbled back to the counter, my heart hammering against my ribs. The corner booth was still occupied. Only this time, the cup was no longer on the table. It was in his hand. The man slowly raised it, not to drink, but just to bring it closer to his sealed lips, as if to taunt me.

I wanted to scream, but my throat went dry. In the suffocating silence, only the distorted music continued to play, and the motionless clock still insisted on reading 2:47.

It was at that moment that I realized I wasn’t just dealing with a strange customer. I was trapped in something that didn't follow the rules of the real world.

\*\*\*

The human mind always seeks a logical way out, even when everything has stopped making sense. As I watched the motionless man in the booth, I repeated to myself that it was just exhaustion, that I was caught in a shift that was too long. Maybe the clock was broken, maybe the jukebox had short-circuited, maybe the manager had left without telling me. That's what it was, it had to be.

I took out my phone to check the time. The screen lit up, and my stomach lurched when I saw that it also read 2:47. The number seemed etched, fixed, as if time had given up on running. I reset the device, turned it off and on again, but the screen always returned to the same time. As if the world had decided to stop at that specific minute.

I clung to the idea that I was suffering from a sleep-deprived breakdown. Maybe I had dozed off standing up and was sleepwalking. I rested my hands on the counter, took a deep breath, and tried to focus on the sound of my own heart. But then I noticed something strange: the echo of the beat wasn't in time with my rhythm. I looked at the floor and saw the shadow of my body on the tile. Only it didn't move at the same time as me. When I raised my hand, my shadow took a few seconds to repeat the gesture.

I wanted to believe my mind was playing tricks on me, but everything around me seemed to insist otherwise. So I did what anyone would do: I looked for answers. I opened the browser on my phone and typed ""Black Hollow Diner history."" To my surprise, the connection worked, but the results were disturbing. Old news reports talked about truckers found dead on the nearby highway, always around 3:00 AM. Some were found inside the diner itself, passed out in that very same booth.

I nervously swiped my finger across the screen, and a detail made the air catch in my throat. One of the photos showed police carrying a body wrapped in a white sheet. The caption read: ""Man found in a strange state, coffee cup untouched in front of him.""

I swallowed hard and looked up at the booth. The man was in the exact same position as in the photo. There was no denying it anymore: he wasn't just a customer. He was part of something that had been trapped in the Black Hollow, something that repeated night after night, dragging in whoever was unlucky enough to be on the wrong shift.

Even so, I held on to the idea that if I could just hold on until dawn, everything would go back to normal. I just had to resist. I just had to not break the routine... not go near that booth again.

\*\*\*

I knew I shouldn't look at the booth again, but something seemed to control me, as if an invisible rope was forcing me to stare. The man was still there, motionless, but this time his head was tilted slightly to the side, as if he were observing a curious detail. When our eyes met, I felt my body stiffen, as if I had lost control of my own muscles. The air became thick, too heavy to breathe, and the feeling was that every breath sank me deeper into a living nightmare.

I tried to run to the door. I twisted the doorknob so hard my fingers hurt, but nothing moved. I banged on the glass, screamed for help, but outside there was only darkness. It wasn't the usual desert night. It was an absolute void, as if the diner were suspended somewhere outside of the world.

The sound of the jukebox started up again, but it was no longer music. It was a mixture of static and layered voices, as if several people were talking at once in a language I didn't understand. I covered my ears, but the cacophony continued inside my head.

It was at that moment that the man stood up. The booth bench scraped across the floor with a sharp noise that made my teeth grind. He walked slowly to the center of the room, and I could see his face better. There were no eyes... just a sewn mouth, as if thick black threads had sealed off any chance of words. Still, I swore I could hear his voice echoing in my mind: ""The eternal shift has begun.""

I ran to the counter and tried to reach the landline phone. The device fell to the floor, and when I picked it up, there was no cord connected to the wall. Just a dead plastic tube. I threw it against the wall, but the sound that echoed was muffled, as if it had fallen into a hole.

The man was advancing, and with each step, the floor trembled slightly. I looked at the wall clock, hoping the hands had moved, that the nightmare had an end, but no: it was still 2:47. The ticking that should have been there was absent. It was as if even time had been swallowed by the silence.

Suddenly, I felt something cold touch my shoulder. I turned with a scream, but there was no one there. When I looked down, I saw my own shadow cast on the floor. Only now it wasn't just delayed: it was standing, beside me, raising its hand to me. Terror took over my body, and I stumbled backward, hitting the counter.

The faceless man stopped near me. He held out one hand, and in his palm a cup identical to the one I had served appeared. The black liquid inside it was bubbling as if it were alive, as if it were calling to me. I refused with a shake of my head, trying to resist, but I felt my legs weaken. The floor seemed to be pulling my feet towards the empty booth.

I ran toward the kitchen, but when I pushed the door, I found myself back in the main dining area. The same counter, the same tables, the same booth. I tried to run to the bathrooms, but the door led to the empty parking lot, where there was only more darkness and the neon sign flashing Always Open. It was as if the diner had transformed into a self-contained labyrinth, a place with no exit.

I returned to the center of the room, panting. The man was closer now, and I could hear the snap of the threads on his mouth moving, as if they were taut strings about to break. The voices from the jukebox got louder, repeating a single phrase between the static: ""The booth is waiting... ""

My entire body was trembling. I knew, with a certainty that was destroying me from within, that there was no more rationalization possible. This wasn't fatigue, it wasn't imagination. The Black Hollow Diner wasn't just a restaurant. It was a prison, and I was the next convict to take the empty seat.

\*\*\*

I was trapped. There was no use in running, or in trying to find a way out. The Black Hollow Diner had turned into a labyrinth with no doors, a stage set only for me and the thing that was walking toward me. The faceless man stopped in front of the empty booth, as if he were about to sit down again, but instead he raised the cup. The black liquid inside bubbled like flaming tar.

He held the cup out to me. He didn't speak a single word, but I heard his voice, firm and sharp, echoing inside my head: ""The seat is empty. The shift must continue.""

I took a step back, shaking my head. With each refusal, my body seemed to get heavier, as if invisible ropes were pulling me to the floor. The jukebox repeated the same distorted melody, getting louder, more and more unbearable, as if it wanted to bury my thoughts. The wall clock still read 2:47, and I realized that no matter how much time passed, I would never get to 2:48.

I felt a force dragging me toward the booth. My feet were moving on their own, shuffling over the greasy floor. I fought against it, but it was like being caught in quicksand. When I got closer, I saw that it wasn't empty. There was a figure sitting there, and my heart almost stopped when I realized what it was.

It was me. My distorted reflection, sitting with its body slumped over like a lifeless puppet, with blank eyes and a mouth marked by a stitched scar. The sight paralyzed me. I didn't know if it was a warning, an inevitable future, or just an illusion, but the feeling of being replaced was overwhelming.

The faceless man placed the cup on the table, in front of my copy. The shadow of myself slowly raised its head, as if it had just awakened. A grotesque smile formed under the stitched line, and in that instant I understood: the diner didn't just kill, it would turn me into part of it. Every eternal shift needed someone trapped, someone willing to occupy that seat so that the routine could go on forever.

My knees gave out. I put my hands on the nearest counter, trying to stay on my feet. The jukebox shrieked in inverted notes, and the sign outside flashed so fast it looked like it wanted to explode: Always Open.

Then the man finally broke the threads of his own mouth. The sound was dry, like guitar strings snapping. When his lips opened, there were no teeth, no tongue. Just a deep, dark hole, from which the voice that had so far only been in my mind now echoed.

""Sit down. It's your turn.""

Terror took hold of me. I wanted to scream, but I realized my throat couldn't make a sound. An intense burning sensation shot through my mouth, as if invisible threads were stitching me from the inside. I brought my hand to my face and felt the skin throb beneath my fingers. The scar was already there, even without me having touched the cup.

The sight of my copy sitting in the booth solidified. It was no longer a shadow, no longer a reflection: it was flesh. It was me, but with hollow eyes, willingly accepting the cup that the faceless man offered. When the other ""me"" drank, even with the sewn mouth, I felt the liquid burning my own throat, as if we were connected.

I collapsed to the floor, suffocated by the sensation of being swallowed by the diner. The floor vibrated as if it were breathing, every table seemed to lean toward me, and the lights pulsed like a frenzied heart.

It was then that I realized: there was no choice. With every refusal, with every resistance, I was only delaying the inevitable. The Black Hollow Diner didn't just want my life. It wanted my identity, my presence, my body to be seated in that booth forever.

\*\*\*

When I opened my eyes, there was no sound at all. The silence was so absolute that even the blood rushing through my veins seemed to have disappeared. The Black Hollow Diner was immersed in an unreal calm, as if everything that had happened was nothing but a fever dream. The jukebox was silent, the lights were still, and the corner booth was empty.

For a moment, I thought I had passed out and the nightmare was over. But when I brought my hand to my face, I felt the familiar burning and the jagged line of a scar on my mouth. I almost jumped out of the chair I was slumped in, but my legs barely obeyed me. I supported myself on the counter and forced my body to stand.

I looked around, searching for the faceless man, but there was no one. The coffee on the table had disappeared. The cup, too. Only the booth was there, solitary, waiting. The clock on the wall now read 7:00. Time, suddenly, had started to run again.

Tired and limping, I walked to the door and pushed it slowly. This time, it opened without resistance. The morning light blinded me for a few seconds, and I took a deep breath of the cold desert air, as if I had just emerged from under water. The parking lot was full of trucks. Several, lined up as if they were waiting. But there were no drivers. The cabs were empty, the doors ajar, and not a single engine sound broke the morning silence.

I looked back at the diner's sign. The neon lights flickered irregularly, as always, but the phrase seemed even more ironic now: Always Open. It was as if those two words weren't just an advertisement, but a sentence.

With heavy steps, I went back inside. I don't know why. Maybe because something inside me had already accepted that I would never really leave this place. The floor was clean, as if nothing had happened, but the reflection in the window glass made me freeze. I was standing beside the counter, but my shadow... it wasn't following me. It was sitting in the booth, motionless, like a customer who waits eternally.

I tried to look away, but I couldn't. It was like looking at a distorted mirror that revealed not only my image, but the destiny that awaited me. And for a moment, I swear I saw my reflection smile.

I went home that morning, exhausted, with the promise of never setting foot in the Black Hollow Diner again. But even from a distance, something remained. Every time I look in the mirror, I feel the scar throb, as if it’s alive, reminding me of the coffee I never accepted, but which is now, somehow, a part of me.

I try to convince myself that it's all in the past. But when I pass by any storefront, any glass, any reflective surface... I see someone sitting in a booth that doesn't exist. Waiting. Waiting for me.

And deep down, I know that sooner or later, the final shift will call me back.",1,1756810285.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa have gained great popularity, and users' search habits have been significantly changed. Not long ago, a user was typing. Now he is talking directly into his device, using conversational queries such as ""Hey Siri, find the best restaurant close to me"" or ""Ok Google, what is the nearest hospital that is open right now?""

For businesses, this change has completely redesigned the SEO strategies. At FDA Solutions, we realize how imperative it is for brands to adjust and proactively navigate their way through this new search behavior. As a reliable [**Digital Marketing Agency in Pune**](https://www.fdasolutions.in/), our goal is to help businesses harness the power of voice search and get more visibility where their potential clients are looking for them.



# Why Voice Search is Growing So Fast

Voice search adoption is not a fleeting trend anymore — it is becoming the standard. Some main reasons why:

* **Convenience:** People can talk to their devices without using their hands, for example, while driving, cooking, or doing several things at the same time.
* **Speed:** It is much faster to create a query through voice than to type it.
* **Accuracy:** The solutions that AI-supported assistants give are becoming increasingly accurate and suitable to the context.
* **Mobile-first habits:** The majority of voice searches are done on mobile devices, which matches the users' preference for quick answers.

According to the study, almost half of the internet searches are voice-initiated. This trend is predicted to ascend.

# How Voice Search Changes SEO

Voice searches differ from traditional ones in that they are more lengthy, conversational, and usually put in the form of questions. To illustrate:

* Traditional search: “best coffee shop Pune”
* Voice search: “Hey Siri, where’s the best coffee shop near me right now?”

Ranking for voice queries simply means that companies have to change their SEO strategy.

What sets voice search optimization apart is next:

* **Conversational Keywords –** People talking normally, so the content has to be in the same style. Long-tail and question-based phrases are indispensable.
* **Local Search Focus –** The majority of voice searches are location-based (“near me” searches), hence local SEO becomes very important.
* **Featured Snippets –** The assistants can take the answers very quickly from the snippets or direct answers; therefore, the organization of the content for easy access is the main point.
* **Mobile Optimization –** As voice queries are mobile-heavy, websites need to be mobile-friendly, load fast, and give the user a great experience.



# How to Rank for “Hey Siri” and “Ok Google” Queries

Understanding the landscape is right, but to improve your chances of ranking in voice search results, you have to delve into some strategies.

# 1. Optimize for Conversational Keywords

After having a clear picture of the landscape, it would be nice to acquaint ourselves with some golfing strategies that will help us get a good voice ranking.

Try to picture the general public and how they might ask questions. Rather than putting all your attention into brief keywords, consider elongated-tail inquiries such as:

* ""How can I be the most successful in voice search optimization?""
* ""What digital marketing agency in Pune is the best for voice search?""

At FDA Solutions, we develop content strategies that match these conversational queries, which in turn makes your brand show up in the voice results that matter.

# 2. Improve Local SEO

Voice search is the main source of local queries in most cases. Therefore, the most important activities are setting up your Google Business Profile correctly, including location-based keywords in your content, and creating citations.

If a user says, ""Ok Google, find a dentist near me,"" then you ought to be the one that appears first on the list of results.

# 3. Create FAQ Pages

People naturally speak in a way that is mirrored by FAQs. Your website can become more visible through the inclusion of question-and-answer style content, as it can be picked by Siri or Google Assistant for voice responses.

# 4. Focus on Mobile Experience

Mobile controls voice search. In fact, a website that is responsive, mobile-optimized, and fast-loading is not only a necessity but a must-have.

# 5. Secure Featured Snippets

Intelligent systems working in the sphere of voice control appreciate answers that are well-organized and brief. To be able to get your answer displayed in one of the featured snippets (the best place through which one can have direct access to voice results), it is recommended to write straightforward, unambiguous answers and apply schema markup.



# Why Work with FDA Solutions

At FDA Solutions, we do not just trend the same way as others, but we take the lead and help our customers to be a step ahead of the trend. Being the Top Digital Marketing Agency in Pune, we are mainly focused on what kind of SEO strategies that built to make us suitable for today's people's search habits. Our team makes sure conversational queries, local intent, and mobile-first experiences are part of your website optimization so that you can get more voice-driven traffic.

We blend traditional SEO practices with contemporary methods such as voice search optimization, local SEO, and mobile performance to make your business stand out. It does not matter if you are seeking visibility growth, authentic lead driving, or digital presence future-proofing; FDA Solutions is always there to take you to your destination.



**Final Thoughts**

Voice search isn't just the future anymore—it's already here. More users are turning to Siri or Google Assistant for their daily questions, so businesses that don't adjust will gradually become obsolete. You can place your brand ahead of the search revolution by targeting conversational keywords, local search optimization, enhancing mobile performance, and aiming for featured snippets.

At FDA Solutions, we are ready to guide brands through the transformation and ensure their success in the voice search era. The point is: will your business be the next one that gets recommended if suddenly someone asks ""Hey Siri"" or ""Ok Google"" about services like yours?

If you’re someone who’s building something meaningful, whether it’s a startup, an expanding business, or a team that needs serious fuel, I might just be the person you’re looking for.

I’m a sales and marketing professional with 4+ years of experience and with a strong grip on communication, operations, and the kind of problem solving that actually moves the needle. Over the years, I’ve consistently taken up roles where not only was I expected to deliver, I was trusted to understand the business, take ownership, and scale it. And I did.

I’m not here to just “do a job.” I’m here to add value, think like an owner, and build something that matters.

So if you’re: •	Hiring for your company or team, •	Know someone who’s looking for a go-getter, •	Or just believe in connecting great people to great opportunities…

Let’s talk. DMs are open. Happy to send over my profile or meet for a quick coffee if you’re around.

Because sometimes, finding the right person makes all the difference.

Looking forward to a fruitful conversation ahead.

He is a leader and true gentleman in everyway that you could imagine. As we’ve gotten to know each other. I’m realizing that he overthinks ALOT of things, even the smallest of details. I’ll give you an example. When he was meeting my aunt, we stopped at a flower shop to Buy her some flowers. We were then going to meet her at a coffee shop. We pulled up to the coffee shop and I said “You can bring the flowers inside so as soon as you see her you can give them to her.” He was like “Are you sure? I don’t know if I should leave them in the car because I’m not sure if the table is gonna be big enough maybe she wants to put her purse on the table maybe there aren’t gonna be enough chairs so she’ll have to put her purse on the table then where the flowers gonna go?” And I just said “babe don’t worry it’s OK she’ll appreciate the flowers. She’ll even keep them on her lap if she needs to she’s just gonna be so excited that you brought them.” And like I mentioned before the more I’ve gotten to know him the more I’m realizing that even with the tiniest of details, he almost gets very stressed out. If we’re going out for a night out on the town, it’s usually in the city and when I bring it up, I can immediately see his mind shift and get stressed. He starts thinking about what time we need to be out of the house, parking and driving and traffic and it’s a lot so I just wanna know is he just an Overthinker? Does he have anxiety?

I got some fun responses to this post a few months back,  but they haven't gone anywhere,  so let's try again! Previous respondents need not reapply.  

I’m emotionally available, caffeine-fuelled, and occasionally inappropriate. I’d love to meet someone open to real connection – flirty, thoughtful, maybe a little indulgent – that doesn’t need to fit a template to be meaningful.

Life’s beautifully chaotic and deeply lived. I’ve got a pre-teen who keeps me on my toes, a wild job I adore, and a chosen family that fills my heart. Most days my cavoodle is curled up at my feet while I wing it with quick wit, offerings to old gods, and not nearly enough sleep. I sit pretty comfortably in the world of ENM & poly – my relationships make life richer, not messier.

I swing between philosophical rabbit holes, ridiculous memes, and late-night confessionals. I prefer voice chats/notes (text has its limits), and love conversations that stretch between desire and depth – curious, present, and a little bold.

If you’re poly/ENM and open to something grounded in honesty, attraction, and emotional availability – let’s talk. I’m not looking for perfection. Just presence.

I’m mostly around evenings AEST, but if we click, I’ll make time. Bonus points if you’ve got a voice I’ll want to lean into (Irish accents have my heart), emotional presence, and wit that makes me laugh out loud.

Flirty banter? Yes please.
“wyd” energy? Hard pass.

My Spanish is around B1-B2 (my listening/reading skills are strong, but speaking is my weakest), and I'm looking for someone to practice with! Preferably a native speaker or an intermediate learner. Please be very patient since I'm not used to speaking in Spanish.

English is my second language, and I'm happy to help you practice. :) In fact, I'll probably end up speaking more English than Spanish, but I'll do my best to speak more Spanish as we go and as we get comfortable.

**A few things about me:**

* I love languages and reading!
* I also really enjoy learning, and I'm always trying to learn something new, especially outside of work. My current fixations are Japanese and astronomy.
* I'm also a creative person and love cozy things (i.e. gaming, tea, coffee, journaling, yoga, crafts, music, gardening, baking, etc.).

I'm not usually on my phone, so I'm not big on texting. I *am* okay with it at the start, but it'll be an asynchronous exchange (in other words: expect very late replies, but I'll try my best while we're still getting to know each other a little). I prefer voice calls on Discord.

I prefer someone aged 25+.

Please please please introduce yourself when you send a chat, tell me what you're looking for, and your timezone.

Not in the traditional way though. Backstory, I didn't even want a wedding and I just wanted to elope or have a small courthouse wedding. I never dreamed of the big party I was mostly focused on the marriage aspect of it. However my fiance wanted a wedding and so I decided to do it. We planned on just paying for it ourselves with the little money we had set aside for it which was $6,000. I was just going to do it at a public park with a speaker, coolers, an Amazon dress and cater tacos (90 people). However when I started planning, my mom and grandma got involved and basically said that what I wanted wasnt good enough and wouldn't let it go until I did what they want. Fast forward, now we are still at a public park but with cloth tablecloths a DJ, an expensive dress, and I needed to take a week off to prep before the wedding. I told my grandma last week that we don't need to have coffee for the dessert bar because we don't have anyone working at the wedding and I didn't think the extra stress of brewing coffee for 90 people . She ignored me and now she is making coffee that day. My mom guilt tripped me yesterday about not having assigned tables because she knows nobody will sit by her if we have open seating. Now we have assigned tables . And my coworker said last week that she would be offended if I didn't make rounds at every table and say hi to everyone at the wedding. ( I snapped on her too and told her to ""be offended then"") I have hated this wedding planning process and I was ready for it to be over months ago. My grandma has given me a little bit of money (only for upgrades to the wedding that she insisted on having...that again, I didn't want.) My mom has again like my grandma, only bought things for the wedding that I didn't really want/need, but she insisted on having. Neither one of them really paid for it and I'm frankly sick of everyone's opinions. They turned it into something I neither wanted, nor wanted to plan. Now it's so big and Ive spent so much money, I have to make it nice and perfect. I've basically been snappy at everyone for months, telling them I don't want to hear their opinions, and have complained about this wedding the whole time.

1n6g194,https://i.redd.it/98al294qcqmf1.jpeg,"$ATYR – Pre-Catalyst Radar: What the Float, Options, and Shorts Signal for the Next Two Weeks","Hi folks,

Hope everyone had a restful Labour Day long weekend. With trading resuming this week, we’re right on top of what is almost certainly the high-stakes window. The EFZO-FIT Phase 3 readout could drop as soon as the 15th or 16th, so it’s fair to say we’re deep in the binary zone now - there’s very little runway left, you could say it’s crunch time.

If you’ve been following StockTwits or X or any of the other forums, you’ll know just how much noise there is right now. Bulls are digging hard for every little of real-world data (more of that in a coming post), and bears are obviously out in force as well - sometimes with good points, but by my observation much of the time it’s just drive-by posts, bullying, or low-effort jabs. The short side, in particular, seems to be doubling down on volume and negativity, and honestly, it’s hard to take a lot of it seriously. On the long side, I’m seeing far more fact-based posts, people genuinely trying to dig up trial clues, patient stories, and actual market mechanics. In my view, the level of conviction and the depth of research from the bulls is pretty striking compared to the noise coming from the other direction.

With so much back-and-forth, and all sorts of little “leaks” and speculation flying around, I thought it was a good time to do a structural audit - to lay out the real landscape as I see it. This isn’t about picking a side in the ‘war’, it’s about setting a clear baseline for the week (and possibly two) ahead. In this post I’ll break down the mechanics, the float situation, the options chain, the catalyst calendar, and all the structural forces actually shaping the tape, so you can put all the forum chatter in proper context.

There’s definitely going to be more speculation, more digging, and almost certainly more volatility as we get closer to the binary.

Let’s get into it.

**Market Structure & Ownership Landscape**

The first thing I always look at in a setup like this is the actual ownership and supply dynamics - who owns what, how much is really available to trade, and how “locked up” is the float. The numbers here are, frankly, extraordinary, and they shape everything about how $ATYR trades into the readout.

Let’s break down where things stand as of now:

- **Institutional ownership is sitting above 70%** of the float (over 70 million shares held by nearly 200 institutional filers, per Fintel and recent filings). That’s not just ETF flow, either - it’s a mix of big index funds (BlackRock, Vanguard, FMR, Russell 2000/IWM, etc.), a cluster of long-only mutual funds, and a surprising number of specialist and crossover biotech allocators.
- **Retail ownership has continued to climb.** My best estimate, based on public data and community intel, is that retail is holding at least 10% of the float, and possibly more, given the degree of “diamond hands” conviction that’s been building up in the sub, CountryDumb and on StockTwits. This doesn’t look like fast money - most retail here is in for the binary, not flipping day-to-day.
- **Short interest remains at extreme levels** - well over 28 million shares short, which is more than 29% of the float. The borrow market is tight, days to cover is high, and the short side has not meaningfully reduced their position, even as we move into the catalyst window.
- **Insider ownership is in the low single digits** - not massive, but steady, with no meaningful selling. Insiders have mostly sat tight through the recent volatility, which is always a tell.

**Why does this matter?**  
When I add up institutional, retail, and insider ownership, it indicates a situation where well over 100% of the float is “spoken for” (if you include the shorts, who still need to source stock to settle their trades). This is classic synthetic shorting/rehypothecation at work - ETFs and brokers recycling the same shares through the system, allowing more to be shorted and “owned” on paper than actually exists in the free float.

For context, this kind of float situation reads as:

- The **actual supply of shares available to buy is minimal.** There are days when it really seems like almost nobody is selling outside of market makers/arbs or very tactical players.
- Every push lower in price appears to be absorbed - by either institutions adding, retail “diamond hands,” or just the mechanical effect of ETFs rebalancing and locking up more shares.
- Every time shorts try to increase pressure or raid the tape, it looks like it gets met with real buying, not forced liquidation. That’s probably why we haven’t seen any true capitulation or breakdowns in the chart.
- The risk of a short squeeze, or at least a violent re-rate, is very real if we get a positive readout. With so much float locked up, even modest buying pressure could move the tape much faster than most expect.

**How does float lock and synthetic shorting impact trading?**  
This is where the market microstructure gets interesting. When more than 100% of the float is spoken for, you get the following dynamics:

- **Dealers and brokers are constantly trying to “locate” stock** for both covering shorts and fulfilling options exercise. In a true squeeze, this can lead to “buy-ins” - forced purchases at the market price to meet obligations.
- **Price discovery gets much more sensitive** - because actual liquidity is so thin, any large market order, especially on the buy side, has to “pay up” to find shares, causing sharp moves.
- **Mechanical buying from index/ETF flows** continues, especially with Russell 2000 and other index additions, providing what seems to be a steady bid under the stock regardless of news or tape noise.

**Educational note:**  
A lot of people talk about “float lock” or “float trap” as if it’s a meme phenomenon, but in real event-driven setups, it’s a hard market mechanic. When the vast majority of stock is held by institutions and high-conviction retail, the market can stay illiquid and range-bound right up until a catalyst—at which point things can move dramatically, for better or worse.

**The way I see it,** the current ownership and float landscape is about as asymmetric as you’ll ever see in a small-cap biotech heading into a binary event. If the data is positive, the tape can move violently - there just doesn’t seem to be much stock to be found. If it’s negative, the air pocket on the downside is equally real. But for now, the deck seems stacked in favor of those who own shares and can hold through the event, rather than those trying to game volatility on the short side.

---

**Options Chain & Volatility Mechanics**

The options setup in $ATYR heading into this binary is about as primed as you’ll ever see in a micro-cap biotech. I can’t overstate how unusual this level of open interest and implied volatility is for a company of this size. It’s not just a curiosity - it’s likely to define the price action over the next couple of weeks.

Let’s dig into the numbers and what they might mean.

**Open Interest & Key Strikes (Sep 19, 2025 expiry):**

Below is a table showing some of the highest open interest and most relevant strikes for the upcoming options expiry on September 19. This is where most of the “real money” positioning is concentrated - meaning these are the levels where market makers, dealers, and anyone who’s short options are most likely to be forced into action if the stock moves.

| Strike | Type  | Bid   | Ask   | Last  | Volume | Open Interest | IV (%) | Delta | Gamma |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|---------------|--------|-------|-------|
| $3.00  | Call  | 3.20  | 3.50  | 3.40  | 46     | 1,795         | 527.5  | 0.87  | 0.03  |
| $5.00  | Call  | 2.45  | 2.55  | 2.50  | 501    | 23,146        | 490.2  | 0.75  | 0.05  |
| $7.00  | Call  | 1.85  | 2.05  | 1.97  | 196    | 9,451         | 476.8  | 0.65  | 0.06  |
| $10.00 | Call  | 1.20  | 1.55  | 1.45  | 137    | 1,698         | 479.4  | 0.53  | 0.06  |
| $12.00 | Call  | 1.20  | 1.25  | 1.20  | 328    | 23,192        | 476.4  | 0.46  | 0.06  |
| $2.00  | Put   | 0.50  | 0.55  | 0.53  | 3,004  | 31,944        | 565.7  | -0.08 | 0.02  |
| $3.00  | Put   | 1.00  | 1.05  | 1.05  | 2,673  | 30,820        | 551.8  | -0.13 | 0.03  |
| $4.00  | Put   | 1.50  | 1.60  | 1.53  | 450    | 14,260        | 523.4  | -0.19 | 0.04  |
| $5.00  | Put   | 2.05  | 2.10  | 2.05  | 1,314  | 9,140         | 486.0  | -0.25 | 0.05  |
| $6.00  | Put   | 2.65  | 2.85  | 2.80  | 93     | 7,128         | 482.0  | -0.31 | 0.06  |

**How to read this table and why it matters:**

- **OI (Open Interest):** The standouts are the $5 call (23k contracts), the $12 call (23k), and puts at $2 and $3 (over 30k each). These are enormous numbers for a biotech of this size. OI this high means that if price starts moving through these levels, dealers who are short those calls or puts may need to buy or sell shares to hedge, amplifying moves.
- **IV (Implied Volatility):** With IV sitting well above 500% on most strikes, the market is clearly pricing in a major move. IV of this magnitude is rare and only happens when there is true uncertainty around a massive binary event.
- **Gamma:** Highest at strikes like $5, $7, $10, $12, which means those levels are the most sensitive to rapid price changes - if the stock pushes through them, forced dealer hedging can create feedback loops (the “gamma squeeze” scenario).
- **Delta:** Shows how much the option price moves with the stock; the deeper ITM calls have higher delta, as you’d expect.

**What does this setup mean for the next two weeks?**

- **Upside:** If the readout is positive and price runs through $7, $10, $12, market makers and shorts may be forced to chase stock, driving disorderly upside. With so much call OI stacked at those strikes, there’s a genuine risk of a squeeze, especially since float is tight and there are few willing sellers.
- **Downside:** If the binary is negative and price falls through $4 or $3, all those puts light up and forced selling could accelerate to the downside. Still, with so much float locked up by institutions and strong hands, it’s unlikely to be a total collapse, but price could easily trade down to $3–$4.
- **Chop/IV Crush:** If for some reason the catalyst doesn’t hit before options expiry, or the data is underwhelming, IV will collapse and both sides of the chain get smoked - so this is not a time to be reckless with options if you don’t fully understand the risk.

**Educational framing:**  
It’s worth repeating that this options market structure is a big reason why $ATYR can move far more sharply than its market cap or daily volume would suggest. Dealers and market makers have a direct incentive to hedge their exposures, and with the float so tightly held, even small moves through these critical strikes can trigger much larger follow-on buying or selling.

The way I see it, the options chain is absolutely primed for an explosive move, one way or the other, as soon as the catalyst drops. The tape will likely follow the path of least resistance - and with this kind of setup, that path can get disorderly very fast indeed.

---

**Short Interest & Borrow Market**

If you want to understand what could really drive price action in $ATYR over the coming days and weeks, I think you have to look closely at the short interest, borrow market, and how the float is actually held. These mechanics tend to be underappreciated by most retail traders, but in my opinion, they matter just as much as any scientific or clinical readout - especially when a stock is set up the way this one is.

**Here’s how I see the current setup:**

- **Short interest sits at roughly 28.2 million shares, or 29.4% of float.** For context, anything above 15–20% is generally considered elevated for a micro-cap. This puts $ATYR among the most shorted names in its peer group.  
- **Days to cover is 9.5,** which is unusually high. This means that, on paper, if shorts all decided to cover at once, there’s not enough daily liquidity to exit smoothly - at least not without moving the price substantially.
- **Off-exchange short volume ratio is consistently around 65–70%.** From my experience, that’s a strong indicator that most of the shorting is happening in non-displayed venues - either from quant shops, structured product desks, or large funds hedging derivatives positions. In these cases, it’s often not “pure” directional shorting, but it still has the same market impact.
- **Shares available to short at brokers are highly variable and currently thin.** I’ve seen swings from 35k to 150k available, but for a name with tens of millions of shorted shares, that’s not much. When borrow dries up, shorts have limited choices: either hold their nerve and hope for new supply, or start buying to cover into strength.
- **Borrow rates, while not yet “hard-to-borrow” levels, are ticking up.** At 0.5–0.7% annualized, it’s not expensive to be short, but in this market structure, rates can change rapidly if we see any squeeze dynamic, broker recalls, or margin desk tightening.
- **Fails to deliver have cropped up occasionally** (sometimes >250k shares in a day), which to me suggests there’s real friction in the back end—at least on certain days when demand for borrow outpaces supply.

**Float mechanics and the “trap”**

If you add up institutional (70%+), retail (10%+), and insider (~3%) holdings, and then overlay nearly 30% of the float being short, it seems pretty clear that there’s more “ownership” of the float than there is actual float. This is textbook synthetic shorting - where the same shares are lent, sold short, then relented, often multiple times, because of ETF and margin account mechanics. In practice, this can create the illusion of more liquidity than really exists.

**What does this mean for the tape, especially around a binary event?**

In my opinion, this setup doesn’t guarantee a short squeeze, but it creates the conditions for one - especially if we see a surprise or a readout that strongly favors the long case. When borrow availability drops and borrow rates start to climb, it often acts as a warning sign that shorts may need to cover into illiquid conditions. On the flip side, if the readout disappoints, shorts might find it easier to work out of positions, but in such a tightly held name, even selling can be absorbed faster than expected.

**Things I’m watching for (as “tells”):**

- Sudden, sharp drop in shares available to short at prime brokers (especially if they flash “zero available” during the day)
- Borrow rates jumping 2x or more in a matter of hours/days
- Block trades printing at or above the offer, which often signals covering shorts getting aggressive
- An uptick in out-of-the-money calls trading on heavy volume, as market participants hedge for a possible squeeze
- Option IV moving sharply higher, especially in the days leading up to readout

**Psychology and market behavior**

Something I find interesting here is the way this kind of structure affects both sides of the trade. Shorts, especially those running larger books or managing risk systemically, tend to be more mechanical - hedging, adjusting borrow, rolling positions as needed. But in a tape like this, there comes a point where the system itself gets stressed - borrow dries up, settlement becomes uncertain, and short holders are forced to react in real-time rather than on their own timetable. That’s when price can overshoot.

From a long’s perspective, what often happens in these “trap” situations is that strong hands get reinforced by seeing forced buying. You get a classic “reluctant rally” - one where the upside is not necessarily retail chasing, but shorts unwinding under pressure, and market makers adjusting delta hedges rapidly.

**Why it matters right now**

As we approach the binary, I think the risk/reward for both sides becomes more extreme. If the readout is positive, the setup is there for a very disorderly upside move, simply because of supply/demand mechanics. If it’s negative, there’s room for downside, but the tight float may mean less follow-through than you’d see in a weaker setup. In either case, these plumbing dynamics are going to be the hidden engine underneath whatever headlines we see.

Bottom line, in my view: the short and borrow market landscape is as “coiled” as I’ve seen in any micro-cap biotech pre-catalyst. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but it does mean you want to be watching the borrow screens and tape for tells as we get closer to the main event.

**Catalyst Calendar & Scenario Timing**

The next two to three weeks will define the $ATYR story for years to come, and timing is front and centre. Here’s how I’m looking at the event calendar, why the exact dates matter, and what we can actually infer about when and how news is likely to drop.

First, let’s just lay out the calendar as it currently stands:

- **Phase 3 Topline Readout (EFZO-FIT):** I think most likely to land sometime between 12 and 19 September, with my best guess still in the 16–18 September window (especially if management follows their usual Tuesday/Wednesday PR cadence).
- **Options Expiry:** The September monthly (Sep 19) is the major inflection, with a record open interest stacked up at key strikes ($5, $7.5, $10, $12 calls, and $2–$6 puts). This expiry matters for market mechanics: if the readout drops before expiry, it could spark a violent repricing and dealer-driven moves.
- **ERS Congress, Vienna (Late-breaking Abstracts):** The embargo on late-breaking abstract data runs until **30 September, 3:00pm Vienna time**. However, in my view, only the *detailed data* is embargoed; there is nothing preventing the company from releasing *headline topline results* (i.e. whether the primary/secondary endpoints were met, and headline safety signals) prior to that date. I’m reasonably sure that’s the way medical congress embargoes actually work in practice, but happy to take advice.
- **Market Holidays:** 1 September was a trading holiday so ALL eyes will be back on the tape starting 2 September.

There’s a real debate going on in the community (and, from what I gather, even among some professionals) as to whether management will wait until after the options expiry or the ERS embargo to drop news. Here’s my read:

- In my view, management is highly likely to announce topline as soon as they have a validated, locked dataset and have completed the necessary disclosure review. I don’t think there’s an obligation to wait for ERS or expiry, and in fact, waiting could be seen as intentionally disadvantaging certain market participants (which brings its own legal/regulatory scrutiny).
- Most likely: A headline binary (did it hit or miss the primary/secondary endpoints) comes pre-market in the week of Sep 16-19, with a more complete narrative and KOL-driven deep dive at the ERS congress on 30 September.
- If the data are truly “clean,” expect management to want to get the news out as soon as possible and let the market begin to reprice the stock. If there’s any ambiguity, it could theoretically be a bit slower, but given the high profile, I think that’s less likely.

**Key educational takeaway:** In biotech, timing around major readouts is never just about science. It’s about how information gets digested, who is positioned where, and how market mechanics can accelerate (or blunt) the reaction. With this much open interest, and with the tape this tightly wound, *when* the news drops is as important as *what* the news is.

A few things to keep in mind:
- If you see unusual volume, price action, or options activity in the days just before expected catalyst dates, it can signal “leakage” or participants front-running an anticipated announcement.
- The days immediately after expiry (if no news drops) often see a sharp reset in volatility and OI - dealers no longer need to hedge, which can make the tape a bit sloppier and more erratic until the next catalyst.
- If the readout lands *during* options expiry week, be prepared for some of the most violent tape moves you’ll ever see in a micro-cap biotech.

**Tape Read & Recent Trading Behaviour**

When it comes to short-term price discovery around catalysts, it pays to watch the tape as closely as you do the news. Over the past week (through Aug 29 close), here’s what I’ve observed:

- **Price:** Closed at $5.36 on August 29, basically unchanged on the week, with a range between ~$5.10 and $5.60. No sign of “capitulation” or forced selling.
- **Volume:** Elevated, but not “blow-off” high. A notable step up in block trades >50k shares, which to me suggests institutional hands are still active on both sides - accumulating on dips and taking advantage of forced sellers, but not hitting bids aggressively.
- **Options Volume:** Remained heavy at key strikes, with large call buys at $7.5/$10 and some put flow at $3/$4/$5 - mostly institutional hedging rather than speculative bets, in my view.
- **No evidence of weak hand liquidation.** In fact, every time shorts tried to raid the tape or push the price lower, buyers stepped in and absorbed the move. That’s not something you see when there’s panic or a breakdown in confidence.

**Signals to watch this week and next:**
- *Unusual block prints at or above the ask* (often signals aggressive accumulation or short covering)
- *Sharp upticks in options volume at OTM strikes* (could signal dealer positioning or event-driven traders)
- *Spread widening or sudden bid/ask volatility* (market makers protecting themselves ahead of possible tape fireworks)
- *Tape “stickiness” above key levels ($5, $5.50, $7.50)* - if the price holds these levels easily, it suggests ongoing demand and reluctance to sell

In my opinion, the tape is acting exactly the way one might expect when most of the float is locked up and the market is waiting on a major binary event. I’m not seeing any signs of exhaustion or forced liquidation. If anything, the structure looks like it’s primed for a major move - one way or the other - once news breaks.

**Key Scenarios for the Next Two Weeks**

With the binary event window opening up as soon as mid-September, the next two weeks are likely to define $ATYR’s near-term story. Here’s how I’m looking at the possible scenarios, why each is plausible, and what I think would signal each one playing out.

- **Scenario 1: Sideways/Range-bound Trading**
    - This would look like the stock trading between $5 and $6.50 as institutions and retail “hold their line,” shorts defend their ground, and the options market pins the tape with open interest at major strikes.
    - We often see this type of price action when neither side has new information, and everyone is waiting for the catalyst. Tape tends to feel tight, with low liquidity, bid/ask spreads widen, and blocks print mostly within the prevailing range.
    - **What to watch:** Declining volume, a steady IV, and open interest that doesn’t budge. You might also notice dealers selling volatility to collect premium if they feel confident the event is still a week or more away.

- **Scenario 2: Squeeze / Upside Acceleration**
    - If credible rumors leak, or if a news event breaks (even a small one), the setup could trigger a move into the $8–$12 range, possibly higher. In my view, this is because the combination of trapped shorts, locked float, and heavy options open interest creates an environment where even moderate buy pressure forces rapid dealer hedging and short covering.
    - **What to watch:** Sudden spikes in volume, price moving quickly through $7.50/$10 levels (where OI is dense), options IV surging, borrow rates rising, and short availability dropping to near zero. Dealers will often have to buy stock to hedge deep ITM calls, which can fuel more upside.

- **Scenario 3: Institutional Re-Rate**
    - If the readout drops and is meaningfully positive, the most likely institutional play is an immediate, large-scale re-rating of the stock. We could see rapid repricing to $15–$25 if top holders hold or add, and new money enters on the news.
    - **What to watch:** Unusually large block trades at the offer, multiple consecutive up prints, and a sharp reset in put/call OI as positions close or roll. Analysts may also quickly revise their price targets and upgrade the name, which tends to feed further institutional inflows.

- **Scenario 4: Shakeout / Bear Raid**
    - It’s always possible for shorts to attempt one last push to force weak hands out, especially if there is a perceived lull or lack of news. This could drive the price briefly toward $4 or even below, but with the float this tight, I think any such move would be short-lived and quickly absorbed by longer-term holders.
    - **What to watch:** Sudden drops on high volume, lots of small-lot selling, and a short-lived spike in borrow availability. Tape will often show aggressive offers being hit, but unless institutions are also exiting, these moves rarely stick for long.

**Educational Notes:**
- Most big moves around catalysts are driven by positioning, not new information.
- Options market makers and shorts can be forced to act at the same time, driving outsized moves.
- The best tells are always in volume, borrow stats, and block trade prints - watch these for early signs of which scenario is unfolding.

**Strategy & Educational Takeaways**

In a setup like this, where the float is locked, short interest is high, and everyone is positioning for a major event, I think the most important thing is to avoid getting caught up in noise and to focus on the signals that matter.

**How I approach it:**

- **Risk management comes first.** No binary event is a guaranteed win, and I think it’s important for everyone to size positions based on what they can truly afford to risk. That means not overextending, not using leverage you can’t handle, and having a plan for both upside and downside.
- **I read the tape and data, not just opinions!** Much of what you’ll see on social media is noise - drive-by comments, rumors, and speculation. Instead, I try to ground my thinking in hard numbers: short interest, borrow rates, volume, block trades, options open interest, and who’s really holding the float. That said, every bit of information is a piece of the larger puzzle.
- **Look for structural signals, not headlines.** The best clues tend to be in the structure of the market: are dealers hedging aggressively? Are borrow rates spiking? Are institutions adding or holding? These are usually more predictive than what any one person says, even management.
- **Be ready to act, but also to do nothing.** In my experience, the best trades often come from waiting for the structure to reveal itself, rather than trying to front-run a move. Having cash on hand and being mentally prepared for all outcomes is as much a strategy as taking a position.

**What retail can learn from this setup:**

- Pay attention to float and positioning - these drive outcomes around binary events.
- Learn to read the options chain, block prints, and borrow market - it’s a critical edge most retail doesn’t use.
- Avoid being reactive to every new rumor or tape move. If you have a thesis, stay disciplined, but be flexible enough to change your mind if the data shifts.
- If you’re in a community like this one, use it to sharpen your process and test your thinking, not just to look for “hot tips.”

In my view, this is the kind of setup where being methodical and forensic really pays off. There are a lot of moving parts, but if you focus on what actually matters, you can navigate even the most volatile periods with confidence.

**Summary & Key Levels**

To bring it all together, we’re heading into the most pivotal two weeks in $ATYR’s history, and the structural setup here is about as tight as you’ll ever see for a micro-cap ahead of a binary catalyst. The float is essentially spoken for between institutions, retail, and a persistently high short base. The top institutional holders (Federated Hermes, BlackRock, Vanguard, FMR, Octagon, Fidelity, plus a series of index and ETF funds) have not only held firm but, in some cases, have accumulated more shares in the lead-up. Meanwhile, retail conviction has grown steadily - unique for a company this size - and there’s little sign of “weak hands” exiting.

Short interest remains above 28M shares, well over 29% of the float by latest filings, and borrow rates are at their highest levels year-to-date. The data says days-to-cover is still high, borrow availability is tight, and synthetic shorts (from ETF/rehypothecation effects) likely mean the “real” float is even less than headline numbers suggest. Practically, this makes new shorting costly and squeezes the available float even further, which is why every test of $5 support has quickly been absorbed.

The options chain is a standout feature here. September 19th expiry has record open interest: massive call positioning at $5, $7.50, $10, and $12, and huge put open interest at $2–$6. Implied volatility is extremely elevated, with front-month options trading at >400% IV, and some contracts north of 500%. What this means in practice is that market makers and dealers are exposed to large “gamma” risk - if price starts to move, particularly above $7.50 or $10, they’ll be forced to hedge by buying underlying shares, which can create a feedback loop and accelerate upside moves. On the flip side, large put OI and high IV means downside volatility is also expensive—market is pricing a real binary outcome.

Looking at the **catalyst calendar**, all the major action is expected between September 12–19. The most likely scenario, based on management cadence and prior PR practice, is that the topline readout comes before September 19th options expiry - potentially as soon as Monday 15th or Tuesday 16th. That sets up a scenario where a clean readout could trigger a squeeze in both the underlying shares and the options market. The ERS embargo only covers the full dataset and KOL commentary (until September 30th), not the initial binary topline, which can and almost certainly will be released beforehand. This has been confirmed by prior market precedent and the company’s own disclosures.

**Tape action and block trade analysis** over the past two weeks confirms that there has been no sign of large-scale exit from top holders. Friday’s tape, in particular, showed elevated volume but no capitulation, with closing prints near the midpoint of the range and clear evidence of accumulation on dips. Block trades at and above $5 suggest institutional players are still defending this level.

**Key levels to watch for the week ahead:**
- **$5.00:** Major structural support; repeatedly defended and psychologically important.
- **$5.50:** Range midpoint; price frequently gravitates here in absence of fresh information.
- **$7.50, $10.00, $12.00:** These are high open interest call strikes and critical for gamma dynamics. If price moves through these levels on volume, hedging and short covering could drive much sharper upside.
- **$15.00+**: Institutional re-rate territory if readout is strongly positive. On a “clean” win, could see rapid moves toward $15–$25, per multiple sell-side models and peer analogs.

**Risks:** There is real risk on both sides. If the readout is disappointing, or if there is any negative signal, the options chain could invert and drive downside, with puts moving ITM and volatility unwinding. High IV means options premium could collapse post-catalyst, so anyone holding options needs to factor that into risk management. As always, in binary events, do not overextend and be prepared for sharp, potentially disorderly price moves.

In my view, the biggest opportunity here is not just in catching the move, but in using this moment to really sharpen your process - focusing on structure, float, tape, and positioning over hype and narrative. This is exactly what the community is about: closing the information asymmetry gap, developing better frameworks, and learning to read between the lines.

# This is a story of resilience and persistence. For almost four months, I battled not scammers this time, but the very platform I had once championed — [**Buy Me a Coffee**](https://buymeacoffee.com/dehek).

# My account was suddenly suspended with no warning and no explanation beyond a vague “risk concerns” email. I had no chance to respond, no examples of wrongdoing, and no transparency. Just silence, delays, and frustration.

What follows is a timeline of what happened, why it matters, and what it says about the inconsistency of platforms that claim to support creators while simultaneously giving scammers a free pass.

# The Bigger Context: Fighting Defamation Online

Before we dive into Buy Me a Coffee, let’s zoom out.

I’ve been the target of smear campaigns for years. Right now, there’s a blog on Google’s Blogger platform — [**dannydehekfacts.blogspot.com**](https://dannydehekfacts.blogspot.com/) — falsely claiming to be authored by me. I reported it.

Google’s response? They asked me to provide company shareholder documentation. Then they told me to “contact the author.” But the so-called “author” is impersonating me.

So, I’m stuck. Even if I manage to get that blog removed, scammers will just spin up another one.

This highlights a paradox:

* Some platforms refuse to act, hiding behind bureaucracy.
* Others act too quickly, punishing the wrong people.

And that brings us back to Buy Me a Coffee.

# The Timeline: Suspension to Reinstatement

Here’s the **sequence of events**:

* **June 17, 2025** – Out of nowhere, I got the email: *“Our moderation team has suspended your account due to risk concerns.”*
* **June 16–25, 2025** – I appealed, explaining my mission to expose scams and protect everyday investors. *“I’m not promoting anything illegal. I’m not attacking innocent people. I’m trying to stop criminal deception.”*
* **June 25, 2025** – Response: *“We’ve reviewed your appeal, and for now, the ban on your account will remain due to the volume and nature of the reports we received.”*
* **June 27, 2025** – I sent further evidence, pointing to my features in *The New York Times* and *Bloomberg*. *“This is classic coordinated behaviour: scammers weaponizing your reporting tools to silence an investigative journalist whose work has saved people tens of millions of dollars.”*
* **July 3, 2025** – Another reply: *“While the ban remains in place for now, we’ll follow up once we’ve completed a more thorough assessment.”*
* **August 25, 2025** – After weeks of silence, I followed up: *“The freeze of my account has cut off resources that enable me to continue publishing this work. Could you please let me know where things currently stand in your review?”*
* **September 1, 2025 (morning)** – Buy Me a Coffee finally confirmed a re-review: *“We understand the urgency you’ve highlighted and the importance of your work, and we’re giving this matter the attention it deserves.”*
* **September 1, 2025 (later that day)** – Victory at last: *“Your Buy Me a Coffee account has been reinstated. You can now access your page and continue receiving support from your audience.”*

# Lessons Learned: Platforms Act Inconsistently

For nearly four months, I was left in limbo. No details. No transparency. Just vague answers and endless waiting.

That’s one extreme: **acting too quickly**, suspending accounts without proof.

The opposite extreme is [**Trustpilot**](https://www.dehek.com/general/ponzi-scheme-scamalerts/trustpilot-exposed-how-a-review-platform-protects-scammers-and-silences-the-truth/). They seem hell-bent on letting scammers rule the roost. I’ve seen them leave up pages for obvious Ponzi schemes, crypto frauds, and recovery scams, while burying or deleting reviews from actual victims.

So we have two extremes:

* Buy Me a Coffee: too fast to suspend the good guys.
* Trustpilot: too slow to stop the bad guys.

Meanwhile, creators like me are stuck fighting battles on both sides.

# From Endorsement to Silence, and Back Again

Here’s what makes this sting even more.

Not long ago, I published a blog called [***Why Every Business Should Set Up a FREE Buy Me a Coffee Account Today!***](https://www.dehek.com/general/health-wellness/why-every-business-should-set-up-a-free-buy-me-a-coffee-account-today/). In it, I praised Buy Me a Coffee as a game-changer for creators and encouraged others to sign up.

At the time, I had **Buy Me a Coffee deeply integrated into my ecosystem**:

* Listed on my website
* Linked at the bottom of every YouTube video
* Promoted on social media
* Embedded in over **150 blogs**

When my account was suspended, I had to strip it all out. I went through every blog and removed every reference. I edited my website. The only place I couldn’t erase it was my **historical YouTube videos**, where I still mention Buy Me a Coffee — but for months, I couldn’t benefit from those mentions.

Now, with my account reinstated, I’m grateful to finally reopen that door. If you’d like to test it, my page is live again, and your support genuinely helps me keep exposing scams.

# Bigger Than Money

This was never just about donations. Yes, I raised about **$3,000** through Buy Me a Coffee and had a base of **125 subscribers**. But the platform also gave me reach — another footprint online to share my work, connect with supporters, and strengthen my community.

Scammers like to call me a “beggar on the internet.” The reality is the opposite: **if I can make a living exposing fraud, I can save far more people from losing their life savings.**

# Conclusion: Persistence Works

This blog isn’t just about one platform. It’s about the bigger struggle of keeping investigative content alive while under constant attack from scammers and inconsistent platform policies.

* Some platforms move too slowly (like Google and Trustpilot).
* Others move too quickly (like Buy Me a Coffee did).
* The only way through is persistence.

If you believe in what you’re doing, don’t give up. Keep appealing. Keep pushing. Keep demanding common sense.

I’m grateful that my Buy Me a Coffee account is back. But I also hope platforms learn from cases like mine. When scammers abuse reporting tools, silencing journalists should never be the outcome.

**Because every time a journalist is silenced, scammers win.**

During our month long stay we were traveling Europe and gone for almost two weeks total. The house was newly renovated and the host was great at communicating throughout our time. Everything changed once we checked out. 

Within hours of checking out we started to receive messages and tons images of damages to the property. Slight scuffs on walls, scratches on floor under the dining table, small marks here and there. I understand their concerns but I’m not sure it was even us as we weren’t the first person to stay there. He is claiming the walls are dirty, we scratches his floor with the chairs at the dining table, damages to bathtub, etc.

I told him to be straight forward with us as to what he wanted but that these images were so close we couldn’t even tell where in the house they were. After about a day he started sending every little scuff and mark he could find. I started to get frustrated as he wouldn’t respond as to what he wanted. He then sent an image of coffee stains on the downstairs couch. This was the last straw as we never drank coffee or even went to the downstairs. I told him that we need to go through Airbnb as there is no proof any of this was us and that we were now being sent every little mark he could find. 

To make matters worse doing our stay he had a delivery scheduled for something to be brought in the house that we would need to sign for. His daughter also needed to come in and take a look at some cleaning job they had done prior to us arriving, I reluctant said it shouldn’t be issue as we were not going to be at the house. A third time a craftsman was going to come do some repairs while we were away for a few hours, again I stated wouldn’t be home and shouting be a problem. 

I contacted Airbnb first but there is nothing they can do yet since there isn’t a case from the host. He is saying he wants an Airbnb personal to come inspect the damages now. 

Can we really be held liable for this when we have no idea if these scuff marks, or scratches or anything we’re even us? We even know some of these are not us. ",2,1756809214.0,AirBnB,2,0.67,False

Hahaha) Lesson learned,I'll use card in future ;) Peace Out xoxo


Warning: EXTREME PETTINESS. 

In fact, SO “Petty” it should have “Tom” as a prefix. 

This was just one of those stupidly, irrationally infuriating things that has really boiled my blood for some bizarre reason. Like, steam coming out of my ears raging. I need to know if I’m the only one who’d be sent into a fury over this or if I just need to build a bridge and get over it. (Which I will, I just need to vent first.)

As a little “Back to School” treat I decided to pop in to my local coffee shop for what is now an extremely rare treat (thanks economy, not. lol), for a proper takeaway coffee that isn’t just insta-swill made by me in the sad little work canteen. 

Thus began my tale of woe.

Girl behind the counter says the coffee is €5.41 (after a local discount). I go “Oh grand! Here’s €20.40” - doing that thing my mam always does where she manages to get rid of coins AND get some nice paper money back. (It’s like magic!) So I’m expecting to get €15 back.

Girl looks at me funny when I say the “forty” part of the money I’m giving her. 

Then, instead of getting a tenner and fiver back in change (whole point of me giving her the extra coinage), the barista girl gives me back… €14.99 in change. Like. COUNTS OUT NINETY NINE CENT - most of which is in pennies and twos. 

Like, part of me is thinking, okay, I technically “short-changed” them 1 cent, but… Now SHE’S short-changed ME 1 cent? And my brain was saying “Would ya not just give me the fifteen, ya petty moo?” But of course my innate Irish-ness and fear of confrontation just had me smiling like a dope, gritting my teeth all the while and walking away in a Bishop Brennan Post-Up-The-Arse-Kick state of shock. (Also, trying to work out maths pertaining to one whole cent on the fly is surprisingly difficult! Hahaha)

I know ones and twos are still legal tender, and as someone who did a ten stretch in retail before being a corporate slave I’m always apprehensive about confronting retail staff who may just be acting out stupid orders from stupid managers/higher-ups. However, most of my retail experience also involved us ROUNDING. ROUNDING. IT’S ONE CENT. WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR MALFUNCTION, MADAM!? 

And also, never in my entire history of being a consumer - going back to pocket money-penny sweets from the cornershop days - have I EVER EVER EVER been handed NINETY NINE CENTS IN COINS!? Even before rounding officially came in, people just did it automatically. I'd rather have something round down to the five cent than a one cent.

Would you have been infuriated by this??? Was she just being weirdly petty cos I rounded up - thus “shortchanging” her first??? Is my anger righteous??? What would you have done???

1n6fugf,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1n6fugf/self_improvement_journey_1st_month/,Self Improvement Journey (1st month ),"Hey everyone! I’m 19 yr old and a second-year student at a tier-2 college, diving headfirst into my self-improvement journey. I’m posting here monthly to stay accountable and share my progress. I’d love your feedback, tips, or encouragement as I work on becoming my best self. Here’s what I’ve accomplished in my first month:

* **Fitness & Diet**: Dropped 5 kg by hitting the gym consistently and cleaning up my diet. It’s been a grind, but the results are motivating. Any tips for sticking to healthy eating long-term?
* **Reading & Mindset**: I’m reading daily to sharpen my mind and stay curious. It’s boosting my mental growth, though I’d love recommendations for impactful books to keep me inspired.
* **Studies & Productivity**: I’m focusing better in class and during self-study, using Pomodoro with a coffee kick to power through. I’m grinding Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) daily and just started learning full-stack development. Balancing both is tough—any advice for a newbie juggling tech skills?
* **Mental Health & Overthinking**: I tend to overthink and analyze everything to improve my thinking, but it’s been draining. I’m working on cutting back to stay present and productive. Anyone have strategies for managing overthinking?
* **Controlling Urges**: I’m tackling habits like po\*n and Fap to replace unhealthy urges with positive ones. As a dopamine boost, I bought a guitar and started learning it for dopamine replacement. Otherwise i try to do pushups or engage with friends when urge hits. Any other creative hobbies you recommend for staying disciplined?
* **Time Management & Habits**: I’ve got a daily to-do list for short-term goals, which gives me a dopamine hit and builds my self-esteem. It’s keeping me on track while I work toward bigger, long-term goals.

I’m pumped about my progress this month, but I know there’s a long way to go. Posting here keeps me accountable, and I’ll be back next month with another update. Let’s keep pushing to be better—any tips, book recs, or accountability buddies out there? Let’s roll!",1,1756808861.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

They were friends before he and I (25F) started dating. Early on, he was honest with me and told me that she liked him, but he didn’t feel the same way and nothing ever happened between them.

A little while after we got together, we all ended up on a night out with a group. That’s when I noticed the way she looked at him. It wasn’t super obvious, but you know when you can just tell someone has a crush? Later I asked him about it, and he confirmed that she does like him but reassured me that nothing would ever happen from his side.

Now, he’s asked if I would be okay with him going out for food or coffee with her. I trust my boyfriend completely, but I don’t trust her. It feels like she might just be waiting for an opportunity.

So I’m torn: I don’t want to be controlling, but I also don’t feel great about the idea. What’s a reasonable boundary here? Has anyone else dealt with something similar?
