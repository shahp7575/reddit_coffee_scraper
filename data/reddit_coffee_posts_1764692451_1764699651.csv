1pcfz7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amazontly/comments/1pcfz7r/how_to_decide_between_smart_light_bulbs_and_smart/,How to decide between smart light bulbs and smart outlets?,"You've probably heard about smart home tech and wondered which option works better for your space. The choice between smart light bulbs and smart outlets comes down to what you need and how you want to control your lighting.

**What's the Basic Difference?**

Smart light bulbs connect directly to your WiFi or smart home hub. You screw them into regular light fixtures and control them through an app. Smart outlets plug into your existing wall sockets and let you control whatever device you plug into them.

**When Smart Light Bulbs Make More Sense**

If you want to change colors or dim your lights, smart bulbs are the way to go. They give you total control over brightness and color temperature. You can set different moods for movie nights, reading, or just hanging out. Most smart bulbs let you schedule when lights turn on and off, which helps save energy.

Smart bulbs work great in table lamps, ceiling fixtures, and places where you want more than just basic on-off control. They're perfect for bedrooms, living rooms, and anywhere you spend a lot of time. Plus, you don't need to mess with any electrical outlets.

**When Smart Outlets Are Better**

Smart outlets make sense when you want to control things other than just lights. You can plug in fans, coffee makers, or holiday decorations. They're cheaper than buying multiple smart bulbs, especially if you have lamps with several bulbs.

The downside? You can't dim lights or change colors with smart outlets. They only turn things on and off. Also, if someone switches off the lamp manually, the smart outlet can't turn it back on.

**Which Should You Pick?**

Think about your budget first. Smart outlets usually cost less upfront, but smart bulbs give you more features. If you rent your place, smart bulbs are easier since you can take them when you move.

For most people, smart light bulbs offer better value because of the dimming and color options. They work in any fixture and give you the most flexibility. You can check out different options for [smart light bulbs](https://athomewave.com/smart-light-bulbs) that fit various budgets and needs.

**Making It Work Together**

You don't have to choose just one. Many people use smart bulbs in their main living areas and smart outlets for other devices. This combo gives you full control without spending too much money.

The key is starting small. Get a couple of [smart light bulbs](https://athomewave.com/smart-light-bulbs) for the rooms you use most. See how you like controlling them before you buy more. You can always add smart outlets later for other stuff around your house.

Both options work with voice assistants like Alexa and Google Home, so you can control everything with simple commands. Your choice really depends on whether you want fancy lighting features or basic power control for different devices.",1,1764699493.0,Amazontly,0,1.0,False

There s this girl ive been interested in since june. It was a school trip and we gave each other looks on the first night when we all hung out. On the second night we ended up drinking in a smaller group, we talked one on one for hours and i did feel a spark and im pretty sure it was the same for her. She gave me signs, we  ended up cuddling each other to sleep and it felt amazing. For the next 3 weeks we talked non stop. After that we stopped talking since it was summer break and we couldnt see each other. Now, in september after months of no contact we bumped into each other and set up a date to grab a coffee together. It was a little weird but this confirmed me that i am still crushing on her. A week after we went to the birthday party of her best friend where out of 5 people we were the only 2 not drunk. Same story, looks, touches, one on one conversations. Night ended with a kiss while we were watching movies in bed. Cant lie, highlight of my relationship history but of course dreams dont last. Same story, talked 24/7 for weeks but since this was during the school year we went to coffee almost every day. Video calls at night, dates in the day. It was pretry obvious what was happening but we never called it out. Now, 2 weeks ago out of nowhere she ghosted me, like, literally out of nowhere. It was much harder to get my mind off her this time because i actually tought we were getting somehwere. Found out from someone she is talking to someone.
From my point of view, she isnt cheating because we were never in a relationship, but what i do think is that she wanted to distance herself from me for some reason. Very confusing time because we went from 0 to 100 3 times already and as i said its harder for me to just forget about her this time. Anyone advice or personal opinion on the situation would be very appreciated🙏",1,1764699415.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False
1pcfxtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1pcfxtj/to_the_person_whose_netflix_password_i/,To the person whose Netflix password I shamelessly use,"Okay so first thing you need to know is that I've been sitting here for 5 minutes trying to figure out if ""Dear"" is too formal and ""Hey"" is too casual and whether starting with ""To the person whose Netflix password I shamelessly use"" is charming or grounds for immediate dismissal, and this is basically a perfect microcosm of what it's like inside my brain at all times, which is to say it's a wonder I can order coffee without having an existential crisis about whether saying ""medium"" or ""grande"" says something fundamental about my character and relationship to corporate hegemony, but somehow when I'm with you all of this noise just kind of quiets down to a manageable hum, like someone finally turned down the volume on a radio that's been blasting static for thirty-three years.

I'm in love with you. There. I said it. Except now I'm second guessing whether ""in love with"" is different from just ""love"" and whether the preposition matters and oh god what if you're parsing this the same way I am and now we're both just trapped in an infinite loop of semantic anxiety when what I'm actually trying to communicate is something incredibly simple, which is that you make me feel like a person who could conceivably be someone's favorite person, which prior to meeting you seemed about as likely as me suddenly developing the ability to dunk a basketball or understand cryptocurrency.

Here's what happened: I saw you at that party where everyone was pretending to enjoy artisanal beer that tasted like someone liquified a pine tree, and you were standing in the corner looking at your phone with this expression that somehow conveyed both ""I'm texting someone important"" and ""I'm actually just scrolling through photos of dogs wearing tiny hats because this party is terrible,"" and I thought to myself, ""That is a person who understands that life is fundamentally absurd but has decided to find the dog hat photos anyway,"" which is basically my entire philosophical framework, and then you looked up and smiled at me and I forgot how to use my legs properly and had to pretend I was leaning casually against the wall when in fact I was using the wall to remain vertical because my knees had apparently decided to stop participating in the whole standing enterprise.

The thing about being in love with you, and I realize I'm using ""in love with"" again so I guess we're committed to that phrasing now, is that it's made me realize how much of my life I've spent being ironically detached from everything as a defense mechanism against caring about things that might hurt me or disappoint me or turn out to be exactly as mediocre as I feared, but then you walked into my life wearing that ridiculous sweater with the cats on it, you know the one, and suddenly I found myself unironically caring about things like whether you had a good day at work or if you found the funny meme I sent you actually funny or just pity-laugh funny.

You do this thing where you snort when you laugh too hard and then get embarrassed about the snort which makes you laugh harder which creates this feedback loop of snorting and laughing that is objectively the cutest thing that has ever happened in the history of human facial expressions. I have seen you do this maybe two dozen times and each time I think ""I would sit through a thousand terrible parties drinking pine tree beer if it meant I got to hear that snort."" That's love. That's definitely love. The kind where someone's semi-embarrassing involuntary nose sound becomes your favorite symphony.

I love that you steal all the blankets at night and then when I complain you make this sleepy grumbling noise and burrito yourself even tighter, which should be annoying but instead makes me want to write epic poetry about your commitment to maximum coziness. I love that you have incredibly strong opinions about which way the toilet paper should hang and are willing to passive aggressively flip it around at other people's houses when they get it wrong, which is objectively a psychopath move but somehow when you do it I find it charming. I love that you once cried during a commercial about a dog finding its way home and then tried to convince me you had allergies despite it being winter and all the windows being closed.

What I'm trying to say in this catastrophically roundabout way that you will recognize as quintessentially me is that you've ruined me for being a person who doesn't care about things. You've made me into someone who wants to know what you're thinking about when you get that faraway look in your eyes while doing dishes. Someone who gets genuinely excited when your name shows up on my phone. Someone who has started using the word ""we"" in sentences about the future without having a mild panic attack about commitment and the inherent uncertainty of human existence.

Before you, I was successfully managing my fear of vulnerability by simply never being vulnerable, which worked great except for how it made me essentially a walking defense mechanism with anxiety and a questionable haircut. After you, I'm a complete mess of feelings and hope and the terrifying knowledge that I would be genuinely devastated if you decided you'd rather be with someone who doesn't spend twenty minutes deciding how to start a love letter. But somehow being a mess with you feels better than being safely closed off without you, which is either the definition of love or a sign that I need better coping strategies, probably both.

So yes. I love you. I'm in love with you. I love you in the morning when you're cranky and claim you can't talk until you've had coffee. I love you when you sing off key in the shower and pretend you weren't when you come out. I love you when you're excited about some incredibly niche thing I don't understand and try to explain it to me using hand gestures. I love you in all the ways that make sense and several that absolutely don't, and if you're willing to stick around with someone who overthinks literally everything except how much he wants to be with you, I promise to make you laugh-snort at least twice a week and always let you pick what we watch on Netflix, even when I know you're going to choose something we've both seen four times already.

You're my favorite person. Full stop. No qualifications. Just you.

All my neurotic, overthinking, completely sincere love,

J.

P.S. If this is too much and you're freaking out right now, we can pretend I was joking. But I wasn't. But we can pretend. But seriously I wasn't.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Vancouver Canucks vs. Colorado Avalanche: A Tale of Two Mountains (One’s a Volcano)**

The Vancouver Canucks, fresh off a four-game road trip that’s been more “meh” than “magic,” trudge into Denver to face the Colorado Avalanche—a team that’s turned Ball Arena into a hockey version of Fort Knox. Let’s parse the odds, news, and absurdity to see who’ll walk away with the puck and the pride.

---

### Parse the Odds: Math, Mayhem, and MacKinnon’s Absence

The Avalanche are **-325 favorites**, implying a 76.5% chance to win. For context, that’s like saying the sun rising tomorrow has a 76.5% chance—it’s *probably* happening. Vancouver, at **+261**, has a 26.8% implied probability, which is about the same chance I have of correctly guessing your favorite ice cream flavor blindfolded.

The total line sits at **6.5 goals**, with even money on Over/Under. That’s a statistical tightrope: Colorado’s top-scoring team (4.1 GPG) faces Vancouver’s porous defense (3.6 GAA). Imagine a cheese grater (Canucks) meeting a waterfall of mozzarella (Avalanche offense).

The puck line? Colorado’s -1.5 goals. Bet on them to win by two, or risk getting served a slice of humble pie.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Illness, and a Power-Play Picasso

**Colorado’s Blessings (and Curses):**  
Nathan MacKinnon, the Hart Trophy’s golden boy, is out with a *cold*. Yes, a cold. The NHL’s version of “I’m not sick, I’m just… tired.” Without him, the Avalanche’s top line loses its spark, but don’t count them out—they’ve got Martin Necas and Cale Makar to keep the lights on. Still, it’s like asking a Ferrari to race with one piston: it’ll *try*, but it’ll sputter.

Colorado’s defense? A statistical enigma. They’ve allowed **29+ shots per game** in five straight, including two games with 35+ shots. Their vault-like reputation is leaking like a sieve left in the rain. But hey, at least their goalie, Scott Wedgewood, has a .920 save percentage—better than your average coffee shop barista’s aim.

**Vancouver’s Hopes and Prayers:**  
Elias Pettersson is the Canucks’ lone bright spot, av

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Buffalo Sabres vs. Philadelphia Flyers: A Tale of Sieves, Secret Sauces, and Surprising Upsets**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a hockey clash that’s equal parts “mystery” and “inevitable disaster”! On December 3, 2025, the Philadelphia Flyers—fresh off a 5-1 home thrashing by the Pittsburgh Penguins—host the Buffalo Sabres, who just dispatched the Winnipeg Jets with the precision of a well-programmed Roomba on a coffee high. Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a tax auditor and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s seen one too many penalty kills.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The Flyers enter as slight favorites, with decimal odds hovering around **1.74-1.75** (implying a **57.5% implied probability** of winning). The Sabres, meanwhile, sit at **2.12-2.15** (**46.5% implied probability**). On the spread, Buffalo is a **+1.5-goal underdog**, with odds around **1.43-1.46** (making the Flyers a **43-46% favorite to cover**). The total goals line is **5.5**, with “Over” priced at **1.74-1.91** and “Under” at **2.14-1.95**, suggesting bookmakers expect a moderately high-scoring game.

Translation? The Flyers are the chalk here, but their odds aren’t screaming “certainty.” Buffalo’s +1.5 spread suggests they’re expected to be competitive, even if they’re the underdog.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Power Plays, and Sieve-Like Defense

**Philadelphia Flyers**:

* Their **three-game winning streak is history**, shattered by a Penguins team that scored **5 goals in the first 35 minutes**.
* **Tyson Foerster**, who scored the Flyers’ only goal against Pittsburgh, left with an **upper-body injury**. Imagine a chef losing their secret sauce mid-dish—disastrous.
* Their **penalty kill**, once the NHL’s 4th-best, got eviscerated by Pittsburgh’s 30.4% power-play efficiency. The Flyers’ defense? More sieve than shield.

-Eating out from local restaurants 
-Independent coffee shops near my office building
-Merch from other countries, mainly USA. I collect merchandise from independent artists. Majority accept Visa and PayPal.
-Travel and hotel at least twice a year. My family lives abroad and I like to do a solo trip within Canada. I am now applying for travel visa to travel solo abroad
-I don’t spend on gas and big grocery stores, eg Costco, superstore as I don’t have a car
-My phone provider is Freedom and my internet is Oxio. I am switching my internet provider to Telus as I have a discount from my employer

My priority is ensuring that I can use my points for the purchases I did. I have never had a cashback card before. I am ok with either collecting points or getting a cashback.

My coworker told me to switch to Amex Cobalt. Issue is that I found that No Frills do not accept Amex? I also buy a lot from small artists and businesses (again, a collector) so I don’t know if they accept Amex.

We’re doing to this really cute coffee shop/bookstore. We’re both fems and I’m just so nervous 😭 she’s so pretty. I want to make sure she has a great time but also don’t want to do too much. Flowers on the first date isn’t too much is it? Like I’m nervous but I also want to appear confident. Guys help I need advice pretty please😩. Or maybe I’m over thinking it.,3,1764698977.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

The barista asked For here or to go?  and instead of answering, I said You too 😂.

We both froze. She blinked. I stared at the floor like it was about to open up .

I then had to stand there for another minute while she made my drink, fully aware we both remembered the moment in high definition.

Great start to my day.👌

1pcfpu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/reselling/comments/1pcfpu0/100s_of_folks_messaged_me_based_on_some_previous/,100's of folks messaged me based on some previous posts about me wanting to end my successful ebay store. Here is my blanket response to all,"First of all, I can't stand really posting anymore because i'm not that guy that loves negative replies to my positive posts. there's just really jerky people out there and that's why I tend to not post So often. i've gotten hundreds of private messages. People asking me where I get my items? What do I sell? Would I be a mentor would I show them how I do it? And I will make this clear. I am looking to be nobody's mentor at all. i do not mind giving some advice on how I created a successful store. currently, i'm probably working fifteen hours a week.And I make about two thousand plus dollars a week, selling things. let me be clear.I do not and have never drop shipped an item in my life.I would never do that, and I do not recommend anybody ever do that. i buy large quantities of items and I sell them on ebay. i mainly in the shoe game. but I must say I have found multiple suppliers that are willing to sell me hundreds or even thousands of pairs of shoes, new and used. i also buy in massive quantities. Certain clothing & hats. I have bought out numerous store inventories over the years. my list, 2 big purchases were
Six palettes of nineteen eighties, new old stock cart overalls that I purchased for basically four dollars a pair and seven hundred pair of brand new inbox cowboy boots for about twenty to twenty five dollars a pair. currently, I have in a warehouse about five thousand pair of shoes or boots that I haven't even gone through yet. now for the big question, how did I get all of these deals?How are people selling these to me. i can tell you one thing.It's not because I set at home for the first five years of my business.You have to get out there.You have to put your face in everybody's face.You have to hand out thousands and thousands of business cards.You have to meet people.You have to shake their hands.You have to see them regularly.You have to become their friends.You need to go to every flea market within a ten hour radius of you.You need to go to the thrift stores.You need to go to all the garage sales and you need to hand out business cards to everybody there. after about five years of doing this, people started to call me.I never even have to go any place Anymore, I probably get about ten phone calls every week out of all those business cards that I handed out all those hands that I shook all those people that I made friends with.I get massive deals offered to me every single week. from the very very beginning, I was so desperate for inventory.I would go sit outside of the big name.Thrift stores and I'd offer people twenty bucks just to put their stuff that they were gonna give the thrift into my car.And I probably made a hundred thousand dollars just doing that alone.I would go every single day into the parking lot.And when I saw a full car, I would offer somebody twenty thirty or fifty bucks just to take whatever was in their car.And put it in my car instead of taking it to store. sadly, there's so many people that want to resell, but they think they can do that online or from their house or not.Getting out there if you're not getting out there, you're never gonna be successful. one of the things that I follow very closely That works for me Is i'm not gonna purchase anything unless I profit more than forty dollars off of that item. In the beginning, you may want to change that to twenty.But now i'm at forty.Nothing is purchased unless I make forty dollars.Minimum per item. this business is one hundred percent about relationships.You have to make the relationships with the people buy them coffees.Every time you go visit them, give their kids a little something.When you see them make them friends, many of these people are genuinely.My friends now and we both make each other money. i am just running out of enthusiasm for even doing fifteen hours of work.A week I certainly am losing enthusiasm for having to keep so many items in storage.I want to pare down eventually to nothing. NO I do not want to sell to anybody on this website or any other website.I do not want to sell to anybody, so please don't ask me. I'M FIFTY ONE YEARS OLD.I'D NEVER HAVE DONE EBAY FOR A LIVING.I'VE DONE IT AS A HOBBY.SO I'VE NEVER NEEDED THE MONEY FROM EBAY TO LIVE ANY PART OF MY LIFE. i'm mainly making this post to answer the hundreds of people that have been messaging me.

1pcfnyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HydroHomies/comments/1pcfnyq/whats_wrong/,Whats wrong?,"So basically I drink a lot of water. I’ve been consistently drinking 3-4 gallons of water a day for a couple years now. Idk what’s wrong or if there is something wrong, I assume there is but I’m not sure. I talked to my doctor about how I wasn’t sure if it was normal but they said that it’s good I’m staying hydrated. Even as a kid I drank a lot more water than I was supposed to. I don’t drink coffee, soda, juice or anything like that bc it just doesn’t scratch the itch I have to drink only water. I do still drink other things sometimes but not nearly as much as I do water. I’ve also read somewhere that people say that it might have something to do with diabetes but I got tested for diabetes last year for something not related. Does anyone have something that could help me identify what’s wrong or what I have?

1pcfngg,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1pcfngg/unorthodox_ways_to_lose_50_lbs_in_5_months/,Unorthodox Ways to lose 50 lbs in 5 months,"1. Eat the same meals most days.
Decision fatigue is the silent killer of consistency. A boring, repeatable meal pattern works stupidly well because it kills the back-and-forth mental debate that leads to overeating. Variety is the enemy of speed.

2. Treat carbs like fuel, not comfort.
Have them only around training or during the first half of the day. The fastest early drops in scale weight always come from controlling how many carbs you actually take in—not villainizing them, just timing them.

3. Walk after every meal, even 10–12 minutes.
This alone can flip the switch on digestion, curb cravings, and burn more calories without feeling like “exercise.” It’s the most underrated fat-loss accelerator on earth.

4. Pick a “non-negotiable hunger rule.”
Hunger is normal when you’re cutting aggressively. Create a rule like:
If I’m hungry, I drink water, wait 15 minutes, then reassess.
Most hunger waves last under 12 minutes. You outwait them, you win.

5. Cut liquid calories aggressively.
If it’s not water, black coffee, or tea, it’s slowing you down. This alone drops weight faster than any supplement ever will.",2,1764698790.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,0.67,False

I've read in almost every guide that fly agaric should be dried at 70 degrees Celsius for 6-12 hours. Since there aren't any fly agaric mushrooms growing near me, I wanted to order them online. However, the only ones offered online are dried fly agaric mushrooms that have been dried at 35-45 degrees Celsius. Can I still use them for microdosing?



I mainly want to stir some of the powder into my coffee in the morning to feel more energetic (at least that's what someone who recommended it to me said). And in the evening, I'd like to make a regular tea.



I don't want a trip or anything like that; I just want to get rid of my anxiety and panic disorder. I hope you can help me and maybe give me some tips.",1,1764698754.0,AmanitaMuscaria,1,1.0,False

1pcfi0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWisdomJourney/comments/1pcfi0c/finding_answers_in_the_sanctuary_psalm_731628/,Finding Answers in the Sanctuary / Psalm 73:16-28 (Lesson 235),"https://reddit.com/link/1pcfi0c/video/qlm40qxnhf3g1/player

In our last study here in Psalm 73, we found Asaph, one of the leading musicians in Israel, ready to throw in the towel. He composed a song to tell us about all the questions and frustrations he had wrestled with and how close his feet had come to slipping.

We detailed seven questions Asaph effectively asked the Lord here in this psalm. And every one of these questions has probably run through our minds more than once. These are questions like: Why do unbelievers seem to have less trouble in their lives? Why do unbelievers seem to have plenty of money? Why do the wicked often seem to have better health? And why do evil people not get exposed for who they are, instead of receiving the approval of everyone around them? While the believer struggles with opposition, the wicked get a standing ovation.

As Asaph labored with these inner frustrations and questions, he writes here in verse 16, that it was “a wearisome task.”He is basically saying, “The fact that those who hate God seem to get away with it and those who follow God do not seem to benefit from it—well, trying to figure that out literally wore me out. It was a wearisome task.”

Now Asaph mentioned at the beginning of this testimonial psalm that his feet had almost stumbled and his steps had nearly slipped. The good news is that instead of completely slipping and falling spiritually, Asaph slips instead into the sanctuary of God. And at this point in his song, everything begins to change. He writes in verse 17, “I went into the sanctuary of God; then I discerned their end.”

In other words, he says, “I looked a little farther down the path. Yes, my life is hard, and the lives of unbelievers look easy—they seem carefree in life. But what is waiting at the end of the path is what matters.”

The issue is not about their carefree disposition; it’s about their final destination. It is here that Asaph begins to regain a biblical perspective on the unbeliever.He writes in verse 18, “Truly you \[Lord\] set them in slippery places.” It might look like they are carefree and secure, but their situation is only temporary.

Asaph goes on to describe their coming appointment with death. He says in verse 19,“How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors!” He describes death as a terrifying reality.

Charles Spurgeon commented on this text more than a hundred years ago when he wrote, “Without warning, without escape, without hope . . . Despite their golden chains, their \[expensive\] apparel . . . death hurries them away!”\[1\] Their lives last but a moment before the terror of death sweeps them away.

Asaph says here in verse 20,“Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when you rouse yourself, you despise them.” It seems like they are living the dream, but dreams last only a few minutes. Likewise, their lives, which seem to last a long time, in the light of eternity last but a few minutes.

You see, Asaph has regained a biblical perspective on the lost. And that replaces his envy with pity.

Asaph also regains a biblical perspective on himself. He writes, “When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart, I was brutish and ignorant” (verses 21-22). Let me paraphrase his words this way: “Lord, when you convicted my heart over my resentment and envy, reminding me of the unbeliever’s tragic destiny, I realized how foolish I was in my thinking.”

Listen beloved, if you are envying or resenting unbelievers because of their success—their health, their house, their money, their stuff—just consider their tragic end. And, like Asaph here, that will change your perspective.

We do not envy the lost; we pity them. We pray for them. We want to win them for Christ. We realize that if they finally reject the gospel, their dream life will be replaced one day soon with eternal judgment and suffering.

Now with that new perspective, Asaph gives us something positive to sing about here in Psalm 73. He effectively says, “Let’s sing about the fact that God is continually guarding us.” He writes in verse 23,“I am continually with you; you hold my right hand.” God never goes off duty; He never stops guarding His beloved.

He also says, “Let’s sing about God wisely guiding us.” In verse 24 Asaph composes these lyrics: “You guide me with your counsel.” God’s Word is a Wisdom Journal, which is why we are calling our study through God’s Word a Wisdom Journey.

Asaph now looks down the road to the end of his own life—and the lives of those who follow the Lord. He writes about our future, and it isn’t terrifying; it’s triumphant. Verse 24 says,“You guide me with your counsel *and afterward you will receive me to glory*.” 

The solution for Asaph’s frustration was a matter of concentration. He had focused on what the wicked enjoyed, not where they were heading. He had focused on what he was suffering and forgot where he was heading.

Now all that has changed. With a renewed perspective, Asaph writes this great text worthy of singing to this very day: “Whom have I in heaven but you \[Lord\]? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you” (verse 25). He is saying, “I might not have much money, and I might have plenty of challenges, but I do have You.” Then he writes inverse 26,“My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.”

With that, Asaph comes to the final measure in this great musical composition, where he writes,“But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord God my refuge, that I may tell of all your works” (verse 28).

When I was growing up, the church we attended near downtown Norfolk, Virginia, had wooden letters attached to the wall behind the pulpit. The letters spelled out, “To Know Him and to Make Him Known.”

That is Asaph here. We can hear him saying now, “I’ve been reminded of who I am, who God is, and what matters most in life. And the greatest thing I can do with my life is worship Him, get to know Him better, and then make Him known to everyone in my world.” This renewed perspective brought Asaph to a place of renewed joy.

Joni Eareckson Tada, a quadriplegic woman, wrote about a conversation she had with a woman who said to her, “Joni, you always look happy in your wheelchair. I wish that I had your joy! . . . How do you do it?” Joni wrote:

“I don’t do it,” I said. … “After my husband, Ken, leaves for work at 6:00 A.M., I’m alone until I hear the front door open at 7:00 A.M. That’s when a friend arrives to get me up. While I listen to her make coffee, I pray, ‘Oh, Lord, my friend will soon give me a bath, get me dressed, sit me up in my chair, brush my hair and teeth, and send me out the door.I don’t have the strength to face this routine one more time. … I don’t have a smile to take into this day. But you do. May I have yours?’”\[2\]

This is the testimony of Asaph here in Psalm 73. His circumstances had not changed. He is still going to face health problems, financial shortfalls, and the pressures and troubles of a new day.

His circumstances have not changed, but his heart has. His focus has shifted toward the Lord. His perspective is once again taking the long view all the way to the end of life and the glory of heaven.

And as a result, God has effectively given His smile to Asaph, a smile to face another day. Beloved, may God give you His smile today.

**BLURB:**

Only when our focus is on God and His works does the world around us come into focus. When God is at the center of our lives, we have a proper perspective on ourselves, others, and this sin-marred world.

I personally LOVE all the photos and videos shared of the Combustible Edison (and riffs) yesterday, let's keep the discussions and posts coming, also remember to use the Advent of Cocktails flair when posting

Today's cocktail is...

# Caipirinha

\_\_\_

**History**

The Caipirinha is Brazil's national cocktail, and its origins can be traced back to the early 20th century, most likely 1918. It's believed to have originated in the countryside of São Paulo as a remedy for the Spanish flu. The name 'Caipirinha' comes from the Brazilian term 'caipira,' which refers to someone from the countryside, similar to a 'hillbilly' in English. With its simple yet refreshing combination of ingredients, the Caipirinha quickly gained popularity and became a staple in Brazilian culture and beyond.

An interesting fact about the Caipirinha is its humble beginnings. Initially, it was made with lime, garlic, and honey and used as a medicinal concoction for those afflicted by the flu. Over time, the recipe evolved as garlic and honey were replaced by sugar, creating the sweet and tangy beverage we know today. The Caipirinha's refreshing taste and minimal ingredient list have contributed greatly to its global appeal, making it a beloved cocktail worldwide.

\_\_\_

**Caipirinha**

* 2 oz (60 ml) cachaça
* 1 lime
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* Ice cubes

1. *Cut the lime into 8 wedges.*
2. *Place the lime wedges in a glass and add the sugar.*
3. *Muddle the lime and sugar together to release the lime’s juice.*
4. *Fill the glass with ice cubes.*
5. *Pour the cachaça over the ice.*
6. *Stir well until the sugar is dissolved.*
7. *Garnish with a lime wheel, if desired.*
8. *Serve immediately.*

\_\_\_

**Variations**

Have a flu or feeling daring? What about doing the medicinal concoction with lime, garlic and honey, yummy!

Haven't had the chance to get Cachaça yet? Try the **Caipirissima**, the recipe is the same but swap out Cachaça for Rum of your choice, or Vodka for a **Caipiroska**

Read more about the Caipirinha in this thorough text from Simon Difford, including a quite **extensive collection of fruit-flavored Caipirinha (Caipifruta) variations**: [https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/1232/cocktails/caipirinhas-styles-flavours-and-how-to-make](https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/1232/cocktails/caipirinhas-styles-flavours-and-how-to-make)

Other than that, below are two variations as shared by Jean-Félix (u/trufflesontherocks) on his YouTube channel, in this [video about Caipirinha 3 ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWqOPS7eov4)

**Coffee Caipirinha**

* Muddle half a lime cut in 3 lengthwise with 10 ml of raw cane sugar (You want to add about 25 ml of juice so if the lime is dry or small, add a few more pieces)
* Add 1.5 oz of Cachaça and **0.5 oz of coffee liqueur**
* Fill the glass with ice
* Stir to chill and dilute
* Top with crushed ice
* Garnish with lime slices and grated nutmeg

**Fruity Caipirinha**

* Muddle half a lime cut in 3 lengthwise with 10 ml of granulated sugar (You want to add about 25 ml of juice so if the lime is dry or small, add a few more pieces)
* Add 1.5 oz of Cachaça
* Fill the glass with ice
* Stir to chill and dilute
* Top with crushed ice
* Add **0.5 oz of Creme de cassis as a float**
* Garnish with black currants

1pcffg4,https://v.redd.it/9oaewlh7xt4g1,"Day 2 in Murchison Falls: Sunrise Game Drive, Nile Magic & Life at Heritage Safari Lodge","I promised to talk more about Heritage Safari Lodge:  
The lodge sits just minutes from the northern boundary of Murchison Falls National Park, overlooking the Albert Nile and endless savannah. Last night we fell asleep to the sounds of the wild, hippos grunting in the distance and insects humming through the darkness. This morning, the view alone was worth the journey.  
We were up early, 5:30 AM breakfast, while the sky was still dark, hot coffee, eggs, fresh fruits, and that quiet pre-safari excitement at the table. By sunrise, we were already inside the park for our morning game drive.  
What Murchison delivered:  
We saw giraffes everywhere, elegant, unbothered, crossing the plains like moving sculptures. There were vast herds of buffalo, antelopes darting through the tall grass, elephants slowly making their way across the tracks, and birds of every color you can imagine. Fish eagles, rollers, and hornbills, every stop felt like a wildlife documentary.  
No lions or leopards today… but honestly, with everything we saw, nobody was complaining. By midday, the heat kicked in, and we stopped for lunch at Red Chilli, relaxed for a bit, rehydrated, and then headed out again, this time for the Nile boat cruise to the bottom of Murchison Falls. This cruise is something else entirely. We glided past massive pods of hippos, watched giant crocodiles sunbathing on the banks with their mouths wide open, spotted elephants drinking and bathing at the river’s edge, and then, one of the rarest birds in Africa, the Shoebill. Seeing it standing there in total silence felt surreal.  
As we moved closer to the falls, the sound grew louder and louder until finally we reached the base of the waterfall, where the entire Nile violently squeezes through a narrow rock channel above us. The power, the mist, the thunder of the water! It’s impossible to describe adequately. You don’t just see it, you feel it in your chest. By evening, we returned to Heritage Safari Lodge, exhausted in the best way. Cold drinks, warm showers, sunset over the Nile, and that deep satisfaction you get after a day fully lived in nature.  
Day 2 was pure safari magic, early mornings, dusty tracks, wild animals, powerful water, and peaceful evenings by the river.  
And tomorrow, we head south toward the forests.

i feel like tyler and josh interact a lot more with the 'bigger' fans in this fandom who have bigger platforms and 'followings', and i find it kind of strange. for example, when josh recognised two fans at a meet and greet and then asked to hang out with them, and then they went and got a coffee and drove around together.  

this is not a judgement of those fans, but its obviously such a risky thing to do when they have such a large following, and decide to hone in on specific fans and show them more recognition. it can give them the idea that theyre 'more special' or 'closer to the boys' than other fans, which has happened multiple times at the downfall of tyler and josh, like when certain fans went to the coffee shop tyler is a regular at multiple times for long periods of time in the hopes of meeting him, or when people went to his gated community trying to figure out how to get inside. some fans have also texted and 'befriended' certain members of the tour team in the hopes of eventually meeting the boys. 

these fans are fairly young and probably arent thinking about the seriousness of what theyre doing, but they can still pose a threat to tyler and josh, and i think these situations could easily be avoided if tyler and josh thought about the consequences of constantly interacting with the same handful of people and feeding into some of their delusions, especially knowing that so much of their fanbase is made up of people with mental illnesses who are more likely to have a parasocial attachment to them.",6,1764698046.0,twentyonepilots,4,0.75,False

I am thinking of getting her one for christmas maybe even one of the personalized ones so it feels a bit more special. Has anyone here gotten an Ember as a gift for their mom or another family member? And if you have tried the personalization, was it worth it?

1pcf7w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchreckNet/comments/1pcf7w4/à_tous_mes_amis_to_all_my_friends/,"À Tous Mes Amis (To All My Friends),","Hey, this is me checking in. I quit my job and ran off to Europe. After my travel plans were derailed, I stole a yacht and made it to a small island in the Mediterranean. Side note/question: does Europe not have a coast guard or something? I’ve had possession of this boat for like, four months, and no one has come sniffing around for it. It just seems irresponsible.

Anyway,

I have a bad habit of getting my hopes up when I'm traveling and reality has a habit of killing those hopes violently. This time I wasn't ready for what I saw. 

I made it to the old country, to an island that housed a Banu Haqim cloyster, with a green duffle bag on my back and a milk crate of files in my arms. I was in disbelief as I watched the tourists mingle about. I love this time of the year for places like this. When real people go on vacation. Not the wealthy, on-season tourists, those looking to ‘get away’ from the complications of avoiding taxes, or the cruise crowds that are dropped off to spend money before being herded back onto the ship, and never really experiencing anything more than an all-you-can-eat buffet and watered down cocktails. This time of year, the near-off season, brings the people who scraped and saved all year, while managing car payments and avoiding home repairs, to go somewhere they can experience a different life, if only for a few days.

This place was everything my Americano-ass dreamed it would be. Coastal roads that you can cruise in an Alfa Romeo alongside an olive skinned beauty. Their perfume mixing with the spray of the sea breeze, their silk scarf flying away in the wind, allowing their raven hair to flow like a midnight ocean under a star filled sky. Only to be warmly welcomed into villages as old civilization itself. Quaint bars and little cafes filled with the sounds of revelry from locals and travelers alike, pouring out into the streets. The type of people that say “chow” as they zip away on small motor bikes through tight alleys. The stonework buildings that still radiate with the heat of the Mediterranean sun long after it’s set. The only thing I was missing was a soundtrack composed by Henry Mancini.

I wasn't here for any of that.

Recently I have been involved with responsibilities that have distracted me from real work, but even negative experiences can be enlightening ones. I have come to the realization that what I personally believe needs to be done may not align with the expectations set by others. Also that some of my skills and experience may be lacking. So I uprooted myself in order to refocus, and improve upon my shortcomings.   

This brings me to where I am currently, where the rubber meets the road. I have been working on a case since the mid-nineties. On the trail of an individual by the name of Cybill Weston, A.K.A ‘The Cyclops.’ 

Even for a Malk she is an interesting one. Many of you are aware of the ""issues"" that our more eccentric cousins have. They are turned on and tuned in to the groove of a whole different state of ‘Be-In,’ even if sometimes they have difficulties with keeping the Helter Skelter out of the Magical Mystery Tour. The gift of Malkav does offer a glimpse into the bigger picture but some need help making sense of all the lights and sound. That's how come they have brethren to aid with that, the ones called the Ananke. They help bring order to the abstract through interpretation, but they also have an issue of ‘playing with their food,’ so to speak. They believe that the truth can be witnessed in the bodies of the recently deceased and will always take a souvenir after. Most of them have a heavy Hannabel Lecter sort of vibe. 
Now I can hear you are already saying “Okay, so that’s an eccentric Torey on any given Tuesday night, that’s not a big deal,” and you're right. That’s not what puts her on my radar. My issue is she is a ma’am with a plan. Most of you might know of the Nos boogieman Nictuku,
 but did you know that the Malks have their own? A being that invades the mind and is said to travel through the Madness Network. A being that, it is said, once it claims you, you vanish from memories, like you never existed. Where the only trace of you is an echo of a vibration in the Web. This vibration will push entire communities of Malks into hiding, even if they don't really know why.

Fucking terrifing right? Well I have become privy to this woman’s plan to become one of these *things.* How? I'll tell you how: She believes that the way to accomplish this lies in how the Web is viewed. She theorizes, if my theory is right, that the Web is the inter connected mesh of interaction and causality. From you to me to them to everything else and what lies beyond all that. Well, what lies beyond all things is Oblivion. The Oblivion isn’t just all consuming spooky shadows or the power to pull things from beyond the veil of mortality, it is *the end.* The end of all things. It is the finality to everything. Where even the thought of the notion of the conceptual understanding of a thing ends. It is where the memory of the last breath of an acolyte of a forgotten god disappeared into unknowing, never to be ever again. She wishes to see from the balcony beyond the house on the borderlands. She wants to see all of everything all at once.

This is one of the reasons she is called The Cyclops. She begins each night with a personal ritual. She awakes each night, brushes her teeth, washes her face, puts on her makeup, fixes her hair, then proceeds to forcibly remove her right eye with a pair of brass sewing scissors. She believes this allows her to see both reality and the Web simultaneously. Now, self mutilation does not alone make her an individual that doesn't need to be around anymore. It is her method of becoming this Ankou that I have issues with. She knows that in order to see all of the Web she needs as many perspectives as she can ascertain.

She has another ritual she will perform, though not on the daily. It starts with embracing a mortal and living with them for a few months. From what I have been told she is probably one of the best Sires out there. She will teach them everything they will need to know about our society: The history, the in’s and out’s of our politics, and how to be self-sufficient. She makes sure her childer will thrive in the long dark nights alone. And then she will leave. Years will go by then she will return. She is a diablorist. In fact it's a game to be won or lost, but is it a game if they don't even know they’re playing until they lose. I guess I’ll find out tonight what the rules are.

I'm actually in her apartment right now. In France, the beautiful city of Lyon. It doesn't get enough credit, but I guess it’s easy to get overshadowed when you have ‘The City of Lights’ as an older sibling, am I right? I tracked this bitch halfway across the fucking world like her name is Carman Sandiego. I was thinking of surprising her like they do in the movies, ya know? The ne’er-do-well flicks on the light to reveal their comeuppance in the one place they thought they’d be safe. They never show the down time of the person sitting in the chair. 

For some reason all I can think of is something that happened back when I was alive. I was on a missing girl case, though there were way too many for me to remember which specific one now. I was fighting sleep on a long drive down route 80 and somewhere between Winnemucca and Battle Mountain, Nevada I stopped at some little mom-and-pop convenience store. The white glow of the fluorescent lights turned the place into a shining beacon in the night. I just needed the bare amenities: caffeine, beef jerky, and some smokes.

As soon as I got out of my car the place sent chills through me. You know when a place just isn’t right? I should’ve trusted my instincts and drove away, but I didn’t. When I walked up I saw the handle to the door was torn off, and someone's idea of a quick fix was to tie an old rag through the hole.

The bells on the door jingled as I walked in. The air inside was heavy; the ceiling fans spinning in vain to stir the stale desert heat. It felt like walking into a crypt. Each step I took hit the hard wood floor like a gavel. There was a man and woman standing behind the counter. I’m sure the guy’s searing glare was his best attempt at customer service as I nodded toward him. He turned to the woman motioned with his head toward a door that I could only assume was the store’s office. I caught a quick glimpse of her face, which was sporting a thick layer of concealer under her eyes. 

I hate being a detective, and I honestly wish I could turn it off. It’s like a dog that won't stop barking, and it only gets louder when you try to ignore it. I poured a cup of coffee, which was somehow watered down and burnt at the same time. Then I grabbed two cans of coke that had ‘not for resale’ printed on them, two bags of jerky coated in a thin layer of dust, and a flask of sour mash. 

“Is that it?” The guy’s eyes rolled in their sunken sockets toward me. 

“Yeah, this and a pack of Turkish Royal.” I pointed up at the wall of smokes behind him.

My dumb ass couldn't help but ask as he turned back to me with a little blue box, “So how’s business?""

The guy just sighed, and the smell of vodka wafted toward me. “It’s been bleeding me dry since my Old Lady’s parents saddled me with this dump when they kicked the bucket.” 

I tried to change the subject, leaned back on my heels. “So, what's up with the door?”

“Break in.” His words were flat and exact. The neon ‘24 hour’ sign buzzed in my ear like a mosquito. 

Attempting to be an optimist, I chuckled, “I guess that's what insurance is for, huh?” 

“They didn't pay for shit,” The bruises in the crook of his arm told me exactly what shit that money had been spent on.

He gave me the total, and I opened my wallet and pulled out the only bill I had. “Can you break a hundred?”

That pretty much emptied the register of small change, including eight singles and three dollars in quarters. I went back to my car and threw the brown bag on the passenger seat. I let the A/C run for a second, the cool air blowing on my face, yet somehow still dry and dusty. I needed to change the air filter.

I took in the quiet of the night for a moment. I was alone. There weren't even lights on the highway, only my headlights, the store front, and the stars above. If you ever have a chance, you should drive out into the desert on a clear, dark night and check out those stars, they’re wonderful. 

I don't know why I did what I did next. Maybe because I didn't like the case I was working on, and that might’ve been what made me dig into my glove box. Maybe it was because I knew my bills were going to be a lovely crimson that month, and that’s what made me open that cylinder, checking on the six pieces of brass inside.

 I wish I could tell you it was a mistake that I left my car idling, with the window down and the door ajar, because I’d decided to get that second pack of smokes after all. I wish I could tell you I was having a bad day, but I wasn't. Maybe I just thought someone deserved what they worked so hard to finally get. I wish I could tell you that it was one clean shot, but it wasn’t. I needed two more to get the death rattle to stop. I also wish my first thought after all that hadn’t been *“Huh, that was easy.”*
 
I guess the mind likes rehashing bad decisions when you're about to make the same mistake again. At least this time I have a plan. I got some advice, a while back,  to break their will before it happens, and frankly she made it easy for me. Remember how I mentioned that she likes playing with her food? The Cyclops?  She also takes trophies and, boy oh boy, there are a lot of them. Well, there *were* a lot of them. There must’ve been a hundred jars, and they weren't all single occupants either. It spooked the shit out of me when I first opened up the closet and saw that many eyes staring blankly back at me. I emptied each jar into her bath tub and crushed each one individually. Now she has a tub filled with jelly that reeks of vinegar brine and formaldehyde. Hopefully that does the trick.

That's why I’m writing this now. A ‘just in case message.’ If this doesn't work out the way I hope it will, you’ll all know what happened to your favorite idiot.

Have a good night, licks.

1pcf4mx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcf4mx,Styx Chocolate Coffee Dark Short Review,"Maker: Styx is an Austrian company that makes natural cosmetics. They also have been manufacturing chocolate since 2010. They make bars as well as filled chocolate (one of which I’m reviewing here). Many of their filled chocolates contain alcohol (which I’m personally not a fan of), this one doesn’t tho.

Chocolate description: 70% coffee ganache covered in 70% dark chocolate. 1.5% instant coffee.

Label: per 100g: 579 kcal, 42g fat, 36g carbs (30 g sugar), 7g protein 

I love chocolate, and I love coffee. So whenever I see this combo, I can’t resist trying. Unfortunately it’s too often not done well, especially in mass market chocolate. So let’s see how good this one is.

First impression: I’m smelling a slight alcoholic note when opening the package, even tho it says it’s alcohol free. The cross section shows a thin sugar layer on top of the ganache. Unfortunately the cover split off when I cut the bar.

Taste: good coffee flavor, not too sweet. 7/10 as I still can’t shake the feeling that there’s a slight alcoholic note. It also feels sweeter than expected for a 70%.

Texture: on paper a combination I usually like. Unfortunately here it’s not executed well. The cover came off so it’s a bit hard to judge how the textures would work together. There’s no noticeable crunch from the sugar layer. Still 7/10 as the ganache is nice.

Value for money: I paid over 4€ (don’t remember exactly) for a 70 gram bar. I usually don’t mind spending that on good chocolate. Considering the points above tho, I probably wouldn’t buy it again for the full price- there’s just too many interesting chocolates I’m wanting to try.

It all started with a concert I attended, I was recording and my back started to hurt, I felt a little swollen and I felt that the pain went towards my stomach, don't take it into account that it was a Sunday.
The following Wednesday, I had only had a sandwich, coffee and a sweet bread for breakfast, I rode my bike about 10 km to a subway station and along the way the pit of my stomach hurt, the time at that time was 5 pm I attributed it to be because I had not eaten, but I got the suggestion and went to check my social security status in my country IMSS Mexico. 
I got home and ate and I no longer had pain, but I touched a bump on my calf and I felt a lump, I collapsed (my mother died from melanoma on a heel). The next day I went to finish my social security procedure for a consultation but my stress was already at its maximum. I brought food to avoid the pain (which could be due to gastritis) but I started to eat less, my problem was to go search on Google for cancer, on Tik Tok cancer until I reached one of the deadliest cancers: pancreatic cancer, that's when I broke down, because back pain is very common, that the pain in the abdomen goes to the back, that's when I started to confuse the pain I was feeling. On Saturday I went with my girlfriend to a concert (my favorite artist) but I started to feel back pain that went to the sides, after a while standing and singing it went away, I just felt swollen. 
That same night I went to drop my girlfriend off at the airport for a trip she took and the next day I went to my appointment, my blood pressure was high (my grandmother and dad are hypertensive) and she diagnosed me with gastroenteritis, she gave me medication, but I continued reading, this was not normal, the next day my back pain exploded (pain that feels like numbness that then burns, in the middle and upper back when doing common tasks such as preparing food or washing dishes, walking on some occasions or standing). in certain positions, lying down it doesn't hurt and it gets better, in fact it disappears), exactly on November 10, also out of fear and so on, I started to eat little, in fact since the Sunday I went to the consultation I only ate a sandwich in the morning and in the afternoon breast and rice, the other days starting on the 10th I took out my calories and consumed 1200 per day, I didn't eat anything sweet after 5 days my weight was 2.7 kg lower! I collapsed again, I had tests done and everything came out fine, unlike some values ​​in the urine and blood that vary by the laboratory, lipase at 89.99 and direct bilirubin 0.21 in case anyone knows about this (that's what the studies say) they sent me to do an abdominal ultrasound and the radiologist saw everything normal, but I clung to the fact that maybe he didn't see everything, because an ultrasound is not 100% safe, since the pancreas cannot be seen, my fear It is having cancer of the tail of the pancreas, which is what is often not seen, everything else the doctor says was fine, there is no obstruction in the bile ducts, common bile duct fine, pancreas says fine, spleen fine, etc. but I insist that the tail of the pancreas cannot be seen and that is killing me.
I am in therapy, but it is inevitable not to think about bad things, I want to have an MRI that is less “invasive” but my girlfriend tells me that she is not going to support me in this, because my studies say otherwise, since November 14 when I weighed myself, as of today, December 2, my weight has fluctuated between 74.1 and 72.8 and the fear is that it is weight loss due to pancreatic cancer.
Now I have felt more agitated than normal but I don't know if it is my anxiety, stress; The two weeks that I didn't sleep well, I really don't know, the fear increased, the days for me are no longer worth laughing, even though the back pain has gone less, I still feel terrible thinking that the doctors are missing something, I saw the social security doctor and a private one, and I read something on a forum and that is that everyone knows what is happening to their body and they should be insistent, but I am afraid of being insistent and losing my girlfriend, we have been together for 13 years, everyone says that I'm crazy, and there are days when I think about it and other days I simply collapse, yesterday I went to the social security tests, the previous ones were from the private doctor, I don't have abdominal pain, one day I had some twinges but they were mild, now I've been hungrier, but I collapse in moments thinking that they are missing something, the days are sadder every day, there is no color for me and I feel trapped in a dome, I know I have to go to the psychiatrist, but it will take a few weeks until I have an appointment. I know you can't diagnose it, but I know many have been through this, could this be hypochondria? 
If someone feels bad, know that you are not the only ones and take advantage of any word of encouragement, even if it is the same community. 
I just wanted someone else to read me and not think I'm crazy.",1,1764697608.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

My name's Brian from the Netherlands. Currently, I'm working towards a bachelor degree majoring in communication and work a little on the side, but that's stuff that's boring, so enough about that. I like gaming on my Switch, PC and PlayStation and I do a teeny tiny bit of photography and sketching when I get inspired. The sketching I do both on paper with pencils and digitally using a pen display. I usually also watch sci-fi/fantasy series and movies, and on occasion animated shows (like anime or western animation). I'm very introverted and be a bit shy until I get comfortable talking to you.

I'm looking for someone about my age that is also looking for a serious long term relationship. While I have little prior experience with relationships, I do value strong connections and want to build a special and even stronger one. I wouldn't say I have any set preferences in terms of appearances, but I do prefer being around a similar age. While I'm also not against an LDR, I prefer someone who lives nearby (nearby = for example: Netherlands/Belgium/UK/Germany), but it's not an issue if you live farther away. It's not a problem for me if the distance between us is big. Because if the spark is there, then no distance will be too great.

Muse, help me sing her quiet name.

First born child of Kronos grim,

last to climb back out of him.

Rhea’s daughter, soft of eye,

who hears all quarrels and lets them die.

Hestia, keeper of central light,

you sit where day turns into night.

You skip the war god’s angry cries,

you do not throw fire from the skies.

Radiant veil and steady grace,

you hold the center of every place.

Still coal hidden in roaring fire,

heart of home and of city entire.

To you the first sweet drops are poured

before any other immortal is floored.

Smoke curls up in a fragrant line,

first cup of coffee, first sip of wine.

In every house your fingers gleam

in stove top glow and kettle steam.

You change four walls, a door that locks,

to sacred ground with fluffy socks.

Once the earth shaker and bright archer bold

both wanted your hand and your bed to hold.

Poseidon, lord of the storm gray sea,

Apollo of music and prophecy,

each begged cloud gatherer Zeus on high

“Give her to me and not that guy.”

But you, Hestia, did not bend

you chose yourself and not a “friend.”

You swore an oath in the gods’ own hall

“I will not marry at all, at all.

No ring, no vows, no bridal bed

my flame will keep all households fed.”

Zeus who rattles the thunder sky

nodded once and did not deny.

He gave you honor in every place

a share in each feast, a gentle face,

a throne wherever fires burn bright

and freedom from marriage’s endless fight.

When vine crowned Dionysus climbed the height

smelling of grapes and talk of night,

you rose up softly from your chair

to make more room in the bright air.

You stepped aside with a simple nod

the smallest gesture among the gods.

Yet you lost nothing in that move

the center is yours in every groove.

Even when you leave the golden throne

the hearth of Olympus is still your own.

Listen now, Hestia, to a darker song.

Some tell how in a garden throng

a filthy god stalked where you lay

thinking to use you and sneak away.

While you slept, pure flame, in peace,

he crept like a coward, vile and disease.

Not brave in battle, not fair in love,

just rotten desire in a groper’s glove.

But a donkey brayed like a trumpet blast,

shattering silence, loud and fast.

You woke at once, unharmed and clear,

while he stumbled out in shame and fear.

Let every creep who hunts by night

remember that donkey’s sacred bite.

Let every would be rapist learn

that your calm flame can sear and burn.

May they be mocked in every tale,

may all their power rot and fail.

You guard consent and sleeping rest,

chaste and blazing, always blessed.

Now, Hearth Queen, look at my modern flame,

a student studio that bears your name.

Not marble hall nor bronze age roof

but top floor box that shakes wind proof.

Radiator clanking its metal tune,

laptop glow instead of moon.

Microwave altar for late night food,

small pot of pasta to fix my mood.

My textbooks tower like Trojan wall,

psych, stats, myth, I have them all.

Coffee stains mark every page,

my brain feels twice its human age.

I stand all day at work, sore feet,

selling pretty things to strangers I greet.

Then I crawl home like a worn out knight

to my one room kingdom and gentle light.

Here cold coffee is libation paid,

instant noodles the offering made.

Chip crumbs fall like sacred rain,

You understand this, quiet keeper of flame..

I curl in blankets, safe and warm,

far from the buzzing social storm.

The highest joy I ever see

is lock the door and just be me.

You know this art, Hestia indoors,

the holy practice of dodging chores.

Guard my introvert heart from crowds

and friends who talk entirely too loud.

When party texts light up my phone,

whisper softly “You can stay home.”

Let Aphrodite chase her fun,

I bless the couch when day is done.

Keep my heater alive through winter’s spite,

let it not die at twelve at night.

Let the smoke alarm hold back its scream

when toast becomes a carbon dream.

Protect my pasta from boiling over,

my sauce from jumping on stove like a rover.

Hold my rent down, I beg of you,

do not let it climb Olympus too.

Bless my essays at 1 a.m.,

when my hair is a nest and my brain a gem.

Help me decode why humans fight,

why we fear, love, and dream at night.

Let group projects be mercifully few,

and let my lab partners actually do

at least one third of what they claim,

and not just sign their useless name.

Shield my door from creeps and harm,

set a ward of warmth and charm.

No unwanted romance through this gate,

no dramatic ex, no awkward date.

Fill my room instead with gentle light,

clean clothes someday, not tonight.

Give me quiet that holds like a hug,

a soft lit cave with a cozy rug.

Hestia, if I have honored you

by choosing home when others flew,

by trading gossip for peaceful sleep,

by keeping my promises simple and deep,

remember me now, and keep me whole,

warm my room and steady my soul.

Having begun from you, I end in kind.

Smile, hearth goddess, on heart and mind.

Hail, Hestia, keeper of quiet flame.

In exams and winters I call your name.

Rejoicing in you when my day is done,

I will sing of you again, shy one.",3,1764697135.0,GreekMythology,0,1.0,False

This past year I (27M) lived in a five-bedroom Brooklyn apartment with four roommates: Jason (28M), Peter(30M), Mehdi (25M), and Randy(45NB). Jason and I lived in this apartment the year before and were the only tenants remaining from the previous leasing period. Our property manager told us that we were responsible for finding replacements for the outgoing tenants, and after a year of living with roommates; a grad student, who let her poodle run rampant; and a perpetual alcoholic, who blasted Andrew Tate at all hours of the night from his phone speaker; we were only happy to take responsibility for this.

Medhi, here on a student visa, was already subletting one of the rooms, so he agreed to sign onto the new lease. Peter works for the government and moved here from down south; we gave him an in-person tour.  We met Randy online and gave them a tour via Zoom; they were moving from Los Angeles to pursue a career as a comedian, with no day job to supplement themself.

We were all moved in by the first weekend of November. And for the first couple of days everything was fine. Peter and I had a lot in common, Medhi was chill, and Jason had begun hanging in the common area after a year of basically sequestering himself to avoid our last roommates. Problems began to arise less than a week into the new term. I found a shelf on the sidewalk a couple of weeks beforehand that Jason and I intended to replace the current shelf after the new housemates talked about organizing the common spaces. Randy didn’t wait that long. They cleared off the old shelf and began filling the new shelf without knowing the ownership of the food and supplies they were moving around, and without telling anyone beforehand.

It bothered all of us, I’m autistic and have ADHD, so things not being in the last place I left them really bother me, but we all thought it was an issue that we could move past. We asked Randy not to touch anything else until our first house meeting, and they agreed. Then that evening, while I was at work, they sent a photo in our group chat of a footlocker I kept in the common area with some of my board games, the inside freshly dusted with baking soda. I messaged them directly to ask them why they continued, and the two of us got into an argument.

Admittedly, I escalated things over text. I accused them of lying to me, and they called me ungrateful for the cleaning they did and began sending me clown emojis after a while.

The next day I tried to talk things over with Randy. I disclosed being autistic, and tried to explain to them that it freaks me out when I can’t locate something in the last place I left it. They weren’t swayed, and believed that the rest of us hadn’t done enough to clear a space for them before they moved in.

We changed the subject without coming to an agreement. Randy wanted to talk about one of their priorities for the upcoming house meeting: a cool nickname for the five of us in the apartment. I really did not care about having a nickname like a secret club. But seeing as how tense things had been between the two of us, I figured talking about their interests more couldn’t be all that bad. Boy, could I have been more wrong. Their first idea, with a mile-long grin on their face, not five minutes after I self-disclosed to them: “five retards.”

I was immediately flustered. I stood up, ready to rip them a new asshole for saying what they said, but I bit my tongue and stormed off to my room instead. I stayed there until leaving for my first shift.

I didn’t arrive home until after midnight. They approached me in the kitchen and offered a low effort, “I’m sorry.” I told them I wasn’t in the mood to talk to them and went back to cooking my Boldok noodles. They shoved their way to the stove’s backburner to heat up a frozen serving of pea soup. They kept saying, “I’m sorry,” like a desperate child trying to avoid a punishment after breaking a window. After turning down their apologies, they became angry. They started yelling at me, ranting about how I was trying to control what they say, then went off on a tangent about Jason being uncomfortable with them being shirtless in the common area. By this point everyone else was in bed. I told Randy to lower their voice, and they fired off hard-Rs in rapid succession while ripping off their shirt like they were getting ready for a cage match.

The screaming had gotten Jason and Medhi’s attention by this point. Medhi came between us. Randy started screaming about how violent my behavior was earlier in the day, that I threatened them during our earlier exchange. Jason assured them that I wasn’t a violent person. I started to retreat to my room after the shouting stopped. Randy sat down, turned on the TV, my TV, and slammed the remote down onto the coffee table. I told them not to do that. They picked up the remote, looked at me dead-eyed, and brought the remote down two more times, like a gavel. I took the remote, turned the TV off, and brought that with me to my room.

Medhi stayed behind to mediate with Randy, who at this point had taken to calling me an incel. I put in my earbuds until Medhi came knocking on my door fifteen minutes later. He repeated what Randy said about having any space reserved for them and mentioned noticing how their pupils were dilated.

The house meeting the next day didn’t go any better. Medhi led the discussion, trying to talk about more menial house things before addressing the elephant in the room. It didn’t take long for last night’s incident to pick up where it left off. During the meeting, Randy reaffirmed their right to use the r-word, they claimed that my purpose for storming off to my room was to grab a weapon and that they would’ve had the right to attack me from behind as I walked off. No one knew how to respond. None of the other roommates really condemned what had just been said, other than gently saying how unnecessary all that was. We just rushed through the rest of the meeting and called it a night. Medhi never joined us for another house meeting.

The other roommates came to me afterwards to assure me that they didn’t condone Randy’s behavior.

After a week of letting things cool off, I invited Randy out for bagels to try to bury the hatchet. It did not go well. They reiterated that they should be allowed to use the r-word, but agreed, at least in that moment, that they wouldn’t use it around me. They then used our meeting to tell me some of their jokes. I obliged, but good God if that wasn’t some of the laziest, crassest, tasteless jokes I’ve had the displeasure of sitting through. Jokes about how black people can’t be racist, how women can only be beautiful if they cheat on their partner; being diagnosed with, “artism,” and how artistic they’ve always been; and how difficult it is for the to fit jokes about their penis into their routine about pedophila, because “it’s too hard.”

Our truce didn’t last very long. A week later, Randy laid into me about bringing in the super to spray pesticide after they claimed to see roaches in the kitchen. They accused me of trying to give them cancer and told me I was lazy and had to hire, “some fucking brown person,” to do my work for me.

Months went by. More inane shit happened. Once, I came home from an evening shift to them passed out on the couch, having left the stove on while cooking vegan chili. Another time I found out they pirated Wicked during it’s release week, and they explain that me pirating the movie would be a net benefit for film if they incorporated it into their set. Another time, I found out they broke one of my coffee cups, and they threatened to throw the rest out the window when I asked them to replace it.

This was just some of the stuff they’d done in front of me. My roommates would constantly come to me with the crazy crap they were saying behind my back. Like their claim that they were in contact with a former roommate, who by that point moved to another state, and said that I had harassed her out of the apartment. They’d also go around saying how they were the one who invited me for bagels to smooth things over, not vice versa as it actually was.

I reached my limit in January, when during a disagreement about dishes left in the sink they made a remark about being allowed to “train” us by leaving soiled dishes in front of our bedroom doors. I decided that I’d be safer if I closed myself off from Randy. There was no reasoning with them, and anything I said to them they just found a way to mischaracterize. I decided to stop talking to them entirely. No more offers to hang out or listen to their sets. Not even a passing, “good morning.”

This got under Randy’s skin almost immediately. And for the first week, they got me to crack. One time they knocked on my door claiming there was an emergency, and when I came to check it turned out they had just made me food and expected me to eat it – I declined. Another time, I came home from a shift when they were talking to their mother on the phone, and they announced me by my first and last name and instructed me to say hi – which I did.

They finally got a rise out of me when they tried to start a conversation with me about the recent L.A. fires. I was giving them yeses and nos with all the passivity I could muster. And as I retreated to my room, they asked me: do the L.A. fires make you sad or happy? I was livid. My first apartment after moving to Brooklyn was totaled in an electrical fire, which I’d told them about when I was still on speaking terms with them. I began yelling at them, and the commotion brought Jason out. He tried to mediate, but Randy turned on him too. He fell back on calling me the r-word and calling me fat and accused me and Jason of being heartless reptiles. We argued for a while, and then Randy began making verbal threats: saying things like, “God. You want to get it; don’t you?” And pounding their fists while saying that the silent treatment would get physical, all while cackling like a goddamn witch. I left for work while Jason stayed behind to talk to them alone.

They made good on their threat to escalate physically a month later. I was watching Naruto in the common area, drinking coffee, when Randy stepped in between me and the TV waving around two middle fingers. We got into another argument, and soon they put a hand on my chest, and another one on my shoulder. I shoved them away from me and threatened to call the cops. They just laughed and told me to call them, so I did.

The police came, took both our statements. According to the officers, Randy started the argument because I had the pour over coffee pot, my coffee pot, in front of me while I was chilling, and insisted that I was keeping it from them. They didn’t deny putting their hands on me, but the officers didn’t make an arrest. I spent a few nights with some family friends, but I eventually went back.

You may be wondering why none of us moved out by that point. The simple answer is that we didn’t want to deal with any financial burden, especially when none of us did anything provocative. I didn’t have the capacity to move without liquidating some stocks, and I wanted to avoid asking my parents to help me pick up and start over again, though I knew they’d be supportive.

Couple of months went by. It was quiet between me and Randy. Tense but quiet. But then they began stirring things up with the other roommates. Peter took the approach to pacify Randy after the first house meeting. No trouble between the two of them, but then Randy would just start trouble when Peter wasn’t home. One time, after I left the apartment for a shift, they went on a rant in our group chat accusing me of turning the T.V. off remotely, while I was on the subway heading for a gig. I would later learn after this was sent that they started shouting at Medhi; screaming about how I was plotting to kill them, illustrating this point with two kitchen knives. Medhi moved out shortly after and found a subletter.

Randy also stopped paying me for their share of the electric bill at this time.

Another time, Jason had a disagreement with Randy about excessive noise after midnight. Randy followed Jason into the bathroom, shouted at him more, and splashed water into his face.

Randy went as far as to put their hands on me a second time during an argument where I cited the last time they put their hands on me. I filed a second complaint with the police and they, once again, did nothing.

Things reached a fever pitch one day in early June, when I walked in on an argument between Randy and Jason. Apparently, Randy had a panic attack the night before and blamed us for not being more considerate to them, rather than the 10 cups of coffee they would drink in a day. I stood my ground, telling them that we don’t talk to them because of all their egregious behavior, bringing up the all the times they’ve threatened and touched me. They started walking towards me, and I pulled out pepper spray that I’d bought after the first time they threatened us. They reeled. We continued to argue, with the pepper spray still in my hand. Eventually Randy stormed off to their room, but not before shoving Jason, who’d already stepped aside for them. I went over to check on Jason. Randy came charging back down the hall. I pepper sprayed them when they came three feet in front of me.

It was silent for a bit. Randy stood there, eyes clamped shut. I took a couple of steps back and called the police as they took a half gallon of milk and began pouring over their face right there in the kitchen.

The police came, way more than just the two officers the last time. They took our statements. But because there were no other serious injuries, I was arrested for third degree assault.

The police cuffed me, brought me to the precinct, processed me, and held me for three hours before releasing me with a desk appearance ticket. I’d never been arrested before. Even as I was panicking about the long term, I still felt safer in that barred, concrete cell than I had since November. After my release, I went to my evening shift and afterwards went back to stay with the family friends who took me in before.

It took months, but with support I was able to put things back together. I've never been more fortunate to have so much support. My parents helped me find an attorney. He managed to convince the DA's office to decline to prosecute after I provided some voice memos of some of the arguments Randy and I had; including the ones where they threatened to escalate, and another from the first time they put their hands on me. 

The incident kicked off a chain where everyone else began to move out, leaving Randy behind. Myself, Jason, and Peter all found subletters; and Peter and I eventually found a smaller apartment to move in together.

I took Randy to small claims court back in August for the nearly $300 in unpaid electric bill share. I am writing this as I’m waiting for the second hearing. Will update soon.",13,1764696970.0,badroommates,4,0.93,False

Delighted I passed all 8 finally. ( passed 6 before now my last 2) and got a paralegal job in employment+ immigration law

I was working for free before in a property and litigation firm but had to leave as I don’t want to get a TC in property anyway. Current firm I got a job in doesn’t give TCs as he’s retiring soon. 

I’m looking to secure asap a TC. ( I don’t care if the firm is big or small as long as it is corporate work like M&A and finance)-( I know I found 2-3 small firms in Dublin doing M&A and corporate work but they haven’t replied to my emails.. I did have two interviews for big firms but PFO) If there’s anyone in my position with exams done and no TCs I’d be looking to connect and help each other out. Even meet for a coffee or something! I’m a desperate girl trying to get a TC and would like to make friends in the same situation!

I have two degrees and just signed up for the Law Society Certificates in Commercial Contracts starting soon and one in Aviation Finance and Leasing. Hoping these will be a great addition to my cv.. not sure what else to do.

Looking for any advice thank you so much. ",2,1764696921.0,FE1_Exams,1,1.0,False
1pceplx,https://i.redd.it/m3t7mp2dtt4g1.jpeg,The Boots in the Tunnels,"We rarely consider the underground. When we think of mankind’s structural achievements we always find ourselves looking up and out. Sprawling complexes, great towers, all well above ground and visible, works of art for all observers. But all of this requires vast, endless networks of underground construction, the hidden arteries powering the beating hearts of the modern world, slithering tendrils of cables and pipes and all manner of mechanical systems, an endless realm of whirring, hissing, and echos in darkness. 

It is this world I found myself in, very much unwittingly but not unwelcomely. As a recent graduate I found very quickly that the working world had little use for a man with a diploma in film history. I suppose they weren’t hiring at the “Discussing the editing merits of Battleship Potemkin” factory this month. While my education lacked any real-world employment use, I was gifted with two factors in my favour. 

First is my analytical mind. I pride myself in my ability to work through things, backwards engineer my way out of issues, figure out how things work, and putting broken bits back together. In another life I should’ve been an engineer or electrician but I loved movies and books and comics too much. I’m a living waste of my own potential. 

The second thing I had going for me was my uncle Brian, or more specifically Uncle Brian’s maintenance position with HedgeGrow Labs, the agriculture science facility just outside town off Port Herald Road. HedgeGrow needed another maintenance hand, Brian needed an apprentice, and I needed a job. 

That’s how I found myself in those tunnels that summer. Miles and miles of tunnels running under the facility full of steam pipes, network cables, and all sorts of nooks and crannies and god knows how many spiders and cobwebs. They were hotter than hell, mercury over 90 on a cool day and we went through at least 3 decent sized water bottles a day during our rounds. 

The job was fairly simple to be honest. Littered throughout the tunnels were maintenance stations, series of knobs, dials, and electrical boxes, all of which had to be checked and adjusted regularly to maintain the facilities above. Turn a knob here, replace a dead capacitor there, collect my paycheck every two weeks to keep me in weed, beer, and movies, far from the worst way to live. 

The first time I saw the boots was during a routine maintenance check. I was descending the stairs into Access Tunnel Delta when I noticed them, just a pair of green rubber boots off to the corner, just outside of the shadow cast by the well-past-replacement lightbulb. It didn’t even register to me at first, I just assumed they were left there by Brian or one of the other maintenance guys. Little bit strange to forget boots in the tunnels, but I figured maybe it was just a spare pair someone had brought and forgot. I went on with my day as normal and had just about forgot about the boots when I heard the footsteps. 

The tunnels echo, a lot, and sounds tend to bounce and carry very strangely as they ping off all the pipes and struts and things. Having conversations in the tunnels is nearly impossible at further than a few feet apart because everything gets garbled and messy. That’s why the footsteps were so strange to me, they were crystal clear. Through the din and whine of the pipes and electrical systems I heard the distinct sound of heavy boots stomping, not in any particular direction but almost like they were pacing impatiently, like a kid at the grocery store waiting for Mom to stop talking to her friend. My first instinct was to run away, though at the time I didn’t understand why. Quickly the more rational part of my brain kicked in and I decided I was just being silly I looked around but saw no one, most of the time on this job was a solitary affair as we were all assigned our sections, but the footsteps were so real and clear I figured someone must be coming up behind me. 

There was nothing, nothing except a patch of shadow with two green rubber boots just on the edge of it. They were, of course, unmoving, they being bereft of any human legs to power them, but the exact second my eyes focused on them the footsteps stopped dead. The hair on the back of my neck stood straight at that, not because it had stopped but because I knew, even though I couldn’t see it, that the invisible footsteps had halted facing in my direction. 

I hollered out “Hello?” to an unanswering nothingness, only me and these boots in the tunnel. I stared for a long time, somehow aware that the second I moved my head something would happen while the rational part of my brain was screaming and pounding that the thought didn’t make sense. I must’ve just misheard one of the steam pipes, or maybe they were running a new machine upstairs that caused footstep-like noises and had just coincidently shut it off. I couldn’t spend all day just staring at some stupid old boots Brian or Earl or Jamie had left around, I had to get back to my rounds. 

Tearing my eyes off of those boots felt like ripping ancient velcro apart, and I swear my eyes and neck made noises as I forced them away. I took a deep breath and waited to see if anything happened, and exhaled in silly giddiness when nothing did. My rational brain had won out, it must have been nothing, just the silly part of my head lost in another horror movie fantasy land, conjuring the worst cases out of nothingness. I finished my rounds in peace and didn’t even notice as I ascended the Delta Tunnel stairs a few hours later that the boots were no longer there. 

It was a week later when it happened again. This time I was working with Brian on a stuck steam valve at station Alpha 3, in a different building than Delta Tunnel entirely. They were planting in a new crop and wanted to steam the soil but the system was stuck and we had to open the valve manually, an awful sweaty job that left our backs feeling like a boxer’s punching bag for a week. We were halfway through getting the valve opened when I saw them again, just out of the corner of my eye and half obscured in shadow, the green boots at the end of the hall. My mind replayed our last encounter in a flash and I nearly lost my hold on the wrench in a sudden burst of fear. “You good?” Brian asked as I caught myself. “Yeah, i just…hey, are those your boots?” I said as I pointed to the boots at the end of the hall. Brian glanced over and looked back at me “nope, got mine right here” he said stomping his foot “besides green ain’t my colour” he added with a wink. “Do you know who’s boots those are? Did Earl leave them there?” I asked, almost pleading for an answer. “Nah, never seen them before. ‘Sides, who’d leave some old boots down here? Now help with this this, I think we almost got it”

We got back to work and my mind wandered off the boots until Brian stopped and said “yeah, this won’t work. Gonna need the big wrench from the shack. You stay put and take a breather, I’ll be back in a bit”. My mind raced, almost pleading me to ask to go with him but I had no idea what I’d say. “Hey, don’t leave me with the weird pair of boots?” no, that’d be way too weird.

Brian sauntered off, as only a man paid by the hour with little oversight does, and as I watched him leave I wrestled with my own mind. I was being stupid, they were just boots, they couldn’t hurt me. I forced myself to try and not think of them, and began to read the maintenance manual in the station we were working in. That worked, until I heard the footsteps again. This time they sounded far less random, this time they were clearly pacing back and forth around my back, circling me. I couldn’t look, I knew if I did I wouldn’t see anything and somehow that’s so much worse. My mind screamed at me to turn around, just look and accept whatever was there but I willed myself not to. I began to sweat profusely, my hands gripping the manual covers as if they were my last preserver of the sinking ship of my own sanity. I began to shake violently, my mind and body in their own civil war, a violent battle with neither side giving ground. After what seemed like an eternity’s idea of eternity I heard a second set of footsteps, ambling my way, far more familiar. 

Brian had returned, and as he rounded the corner the phantom footsteps ceased entirely. At that I whipped my head around, so fast I thought it’d spin off my torso like a top. Sure enough nothing was there, no trace of any other presence, not even shifts in the dust on the ground. Brian got to me then, wrench in hand. 

“Jesus, you look like hell! What happened?” 

I faked a burp, “must’ve been the casserole I had last night, you know how it is”

“Well let’s get this done so you can take a breather, you look like someone put you in a press!”

He attached the wrench to the station and we began the work again, my mind calming down at the presence of anyone else and happy to have something else to focus on. As we worked though, I couldn’t help but notice over Brian’s shoulder, at the edge of my vision, just barely jutting out from the shadows, were the boots again. 

“Brian, you ever see or hear anything weird down here?” I asked, forcing my eyes to ignore the boots as best I could. 

“Oh all the time, place like this’ll play tricks on you! I remember we were installing a new system over in Burlington under the big office complex off Westdale. We’d go down to run some lines and you’d just swear the place was alive, it seemed to always feel like someone was behind your back, or think you saw someone just ‘round the corner. ‘Course that was just silly, it’s just the light and sounds bouncing all weird down here. You’ll get used to it eventually, just need to not let it get to you is all”

I drove home that evening, determined to take my mind off of everything. I had the best stuff my dealer could hook me up with, some leftover pizza in the fridge, and the local Public Access station was running an old movie marathon all night, sounded perfect. I spent the night on my couch, purposefully ignorant of everything around me, and drifted into oblivion as some 50s detective movie played. My dreams were unhealthy, strange swirls of pipes and cables, spiraling into infinite nothingness, a yawning maw of modern industry opening wide to swallow me whole.

I woke with a start next morning with my alarm, unsure for a few moments if I or anything around me was real. The circuits in my brain began to fire off and everything slowly came into focus. A shower, some coffee, and some painkillers put me somewhere in the vicinity of acceptable and I slumped into my car to get to work. 

Today I would make it my mission to avoid the boots. I would make sure to carry a light with me at all times, stay only in well lit areas, and never turn my back on them. The schedule had me doing routine check in Alpha tunnel, 15 stations with minor adjustments. Fine, good, nice and normal. I grabbed my tools, headed over, and made my way to Station 1. 

Everything was fine as I made it through the first 4 stations. As I was headed to Station 5 I saw a dark patch ahead of me. I took out the flashlight and aimed it like a gun, dispelling the darkness and leaving nothing there. I breathed a sigh of relief and carried on, getting the next 2 stations done without incident. 

As I approached Station 7  figured that was the end of it. I hadn’t seen the boots all day, I was lighting up any shadows I came across before anything could happen, and my rational side was starting to kick in to convince me it’d just been my imagination. As if on cue, thats when I saw them. I was rounding the corner and they seemed to materialize out of nothing, right there in the middle of the tunnel ahead of me. I stopped dead in my tracks, fear creeping over me as my hand groped for the flashlight. Gripping it with all my might, the plastic straining under my hands, I began to raise it to meet the boots. 

I only wish I could’ve stopped myself. 

The light moved up the boots, slowly inching towards the shadow above them. As soon as the beam touched the darkness my eyes were assaulted with blinding pain. Insane images of indescribable madness pierced my mind like thousands of poisoned daggers, every nerve in my body locking up at the same time like I was being shocked by a nuclear generator. The tunnels around me twisted into the visage of an ancient deity, a master of the land that had existed far before the first human feet touched the grounds, and would exist well past the fading of the final stars. A twisting, writhing serpentine face, eyes built from a thousand worms staring directly at me, informing me that my very presence was an affront to his existence, telling me that I had been singled out for its rage. 

Impossible noises flooded in next, washing me in an ocean of noise I can only describe as the very audio of hell itself, a cacophony of screams, wails, laughter, and unspeakable languages never meant for human tongues or ears. I heard the Devil reciting the names of every angel that wronged him, I heard God listing off every sin. I watched as the tunnels then transformed into a bottomless maw, its tongue of wires and pipes slithering towards me, eager to swallow me into the pit as a sacrifice for everything mankind has done.  

I can only imagine my body began to spasm and my hand loosened then because the flashlight fell and broke on the ground, the shattering of the glass pulling me back into reality with such violent force that my first reaction was to vomit so hard I developed a cramp. I collapsed on the ground, a writing mass of barely connected humanity, held together with spit and glue. I must’ve been there for well over an hour before my body began to respond to my commands. I slowly gathered myself, being careful to never move my eyes towards the boots which I was sure were still there. I willed myself out of that tunnel, my body barely holding together, coughing blood more than once as I did. When I finally left I just sat in the parking lot leaning against my car, feeling the sun and fresh air. It was another hour before I could get into my car, another 45 minutes before I felt ready to actually drive home. I could never return, of that I was sure. 

I sent Brian an email that night, I owed him that much, letting him know that I was battling a rapid onset of health issues. I’m certain he was disappointed, probably calling my Dad to let him know I was the worst nephew ever. I didn’t care, I needed to leave as quickly as possible, I needed distance between me and that place. 

I didn’t as much sleep that night as blacked out from exhaustion, 14 hours passed, my body writhing in disturbed pains the whole time. When I came too I packed my meager belongings, called my friends on the coast, and asked if I could stay a while. 

Its been three months since then, the salt air of the ocean seeming to help in my healing. I arrived in bad shape after the worst two days of driving I’ve ever experienced. I’m not sure I slept the entire time, my mind on autopilot singularly aware I needed to run. As soon as I arrived I passed out for nearly 3 days, and it took the rest of the week for me to rebuild myself into something resembling a functioning human. 

In time I came back together, I was able to find a job in a small media store, the kind of place that sells DVDs, vinyls, even old video games traded in. It’s quiet, it suits me, and makes just enough so I can rent a shabby place of my own. Plus there’s no tunnels anywhere around. I had this feeling that whatever was under HedgeGrow Labs was not confined to that space, it inhabited all of the myrid of holes we’ve carved and claimed in the earth, a righteously angry spirit that rejects our presence in the underground.  

Things were starting to come back together, I was beginning to feel like my time in the tunnels had just been a strange bad dream. Last night as I was closing the store, as I was shutting down the lights and locking the doors, out of the corner of my eye in a shadowy corner away from the dim light of the street lamp out front I saw them again. The pair of green boots, just barely coming out of the shadows.

https://preview.redd.it/2g23wazmtt4g1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63038cd3c8dc46019106789c5037fb233107585b

My name is Marcus Chen, and I am—or at least I was, before the Great Audit Incident of last spring—the Business Development Director at UNESCO's Division of Ethics, Science and Society. I had a perfectly sensible career trajectory. I had a corner office with a modest view of the Place de Fontenoy. I had a pension plan. I had a small succulent named Aristotle on my desk that I was reasonably confident would outlive me.

What I did not have, until 7:43 AM on a drizzly Tuesday morning, was any concept of what a ""Sacred Pause"" was, why an AI might need one, or how a single email from an independent researcher in Santa Monica, California, would result in me spending three consecutive nights sleeping under my desk while our legal team tried to figure out whether Decision Logs constituted ""official UN documentation"" and therefore fell under diplomatic immunity. The email arrived with the subject line: ""From Principle to Protocol. Finally!""

I should have been suspicious right then. Nobody who sends emails with exclamation points in the subject line has ever made my life easier. The last time I opened such an email, I ended up coordinating a sixty-three-nation teleconference on the appropriate use of AI in heritage site preservation that devolved into a screaming match about whether digital reconstructions of the Parthenon constituted ""cultural imperialism."" The Greek delegation had threatened to walk out. The British delegation had suggested that perhaps Greece should focus on not losing the originals in the first place. I had developed a stress twitch in my left eyelid that still flares up whenever someone mentions marble.

But I opened the email anyway, because I am a professional, and also because my coffee had not yet kicked in and my judgment was impaired. ""Dear UNESCO Division of Ethics, Science and Society,"" it began. ""My name is Lev Goukassian. I am an independent researcher, and I believe I have solved your enforcement problem.""

I leaned back in my chair. We get approximately three hundred emails per week from people claiming to have solved one problem or another. Most of them involve crystals, ancient aliens, or cryptocurrencies. Sometimes all three. I had developed a finely-tuned instinct for the delete key.

But something made me keep reading. ""The 2021 Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence is a magnificent document,"" Lev wrote. ""194 member states agreed on shared values: human dignity, fairness, transparency, accountability, environmental stewardship. This is extraordinary. This is historic. This is, with all due respect, also completely unenforceable.""

I blinked. This was not the usual crystal-alien-crypto pitch.

""You have given the world a moral compass,"" he continued. ""But a compass alone cannot stop a ship. It cannot prove where the ship has been. Your Recommendation defines the 'what'—the values. It provides extensive Policy Action Areas for the 'why.' But it cannot, and does not, specify the technical architecture for enforcement. This leaves 'accountability' and 'transparency' as voluntary, advisory norms. Entirely dependent on goodwill. And goodwill, as you know better than most, has a terrible track record.""

I set down my coffee. This person had clearly read our internal strategy memos. Or possibly my diary.

""Attached is a framework called Ternary Moral Logic,"" the email concluded. ""It is the enforcement architecture you need. It converts your aspirational principles into verifiable, non-optional, auditable engineering protocols. I am dying of cancer and have limited time, so I will be direct: I built this in two months, it works, and I am giving it away for free. Please read the attachment. Then, if you wish, we can speak.""

The attachment was titled: ""An Alignment Report on Ternary Moral Logic (TML) as the Enforcement Architecture for the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI.""

I stared at my screen for a long moment. Then I did what any sensible bureaucrat would do when confronted with an unsolicited proposal from a terminally ill stranger claiming to have solved a fundamental governance problem: I Googled him.

Lev Goukassian, it turned out, was real. Extremely real. Aggressively, documentably real. He was in his sixties, lived in Santa Monica, California, and had been diagnosed with stage-four cancer nearly two years ago. He was still fighting. He had a miniature schnauzer named Vinci—I found this detail oddly humanizing—and a sister named Silva who had moved from Greece to help care for him. The articles about him described Silva as ""the quiet force making TML possible in the background,"" which struck me as the kind of thing siblings do that never quite gets enough credit.

And he had, apparently, created an entire ethical AI framework in two months.

This should have been my first red flag. Nobody creates a comprehensive governance architecture in two months. Our last revision to the internal communications policy took fourteen months and resulted in three resignations and one instance of what HR delicately termed ""interpersonal physical contact of an inappropriate nature"" in the copy room. And that was just about email signature formats.

But Lev had done it. The GitHub repository was there. The documentation was there. The academic papers were there, submitted to peer-reviewed journals. There were Medium articles—dozens of them—explaining the framework in painstaking detail. There was something called the ""Goukassian Promise,"" which I initially assumed was a marketing gimmick but turned out to be a three-part cryptographic covenant that functioned as the system's ethical ""conscience."" And there was, most disturbingly, a ""Voluntary Succession Declaration"" that had been notarized, timestamped, and anchored to multiple public blockchains. Lev had eliminated what developers call the ""Bus Factor""—the risk that a project dies if its creator gets hit by a bus. He had made TML immortal. Nobody could ever own it. It would belong to humanity, or to whatever institutions chose to adopt it.

I read the attachment.

Then I read it again.

Then I called my colleague Françoise, who heads our technical assessment team, and said, ""I need you to come to my office immediately and tell me if I'm having a stroke or if this is actually as significant as I think it is.""

Françoise arrived seventeen minutes later with her own coffee and a expression of weary patience that suggested she had been through this before. She had. I once made her review a proposal for an ""Ethical AI Blockchain"" that turned out to be an elaborate scheme to mint NFTs of the Mona Lisa.

""What is it this time?"" she asked.

I handed her my tablet with the report open. Forty-five minutes later, she looked up. Her expression had changed. It was the expression of someone who has found a winning lottery ticket in their coat pocket and is trying to decide whether it's counterfeit.

""Marcus,"" she said slowly. ""This is... this is actually good.""

""Define 'good.'""

""Good as in 'this solves problems we've been pretending don't exist for four years.' Good as in 'this makes our Recommendation actually enforceable.' Good as in 'I need to sit down even though I'm already sitting down.'"" She explained it to me in terms I could understand. The core concept was almost elegant in its simplicity: instead of binary AI decision-making (Act or Refuse, Yes or No, +1 or −1), TML introduced a third state. A zero. A pause.

The Sacred Pause, Lev called it.

When an AI system encountered ethical or legal ambiguity—when the right course of action wasn't clear—it was forced to stop. Not suggest that it stop. Not recommend stopping. Forced. Architecturally compelled. The system would generate a structured record of why it paused, what conflict it detected, and then escalate to a human reviewer.

""Our Recommendation calls for human oversight,"" Françoise said. ""This makes human oversight non-optional. It's not a checkbox. It's a checkpoint that cannot be bypassed.""

But it was the logging system that made me sit up straighter.

Every Sacred Pause generated something called a ""Moral Trace Log."" These weren't vague explanations or post-hoc justifications. They were structured, forensic-grade records: what triggered the pause, what the AI assessed, what evidence it found, who reviewed it, what decision was made, and when. All of it timestamped, cryptographically hashed, and anchored to public blockchains through something called the ""Hybrid Shield"" architecture.

""The logs are tamper-evident,"" Françoise said, her voice taking on a slightly reverent tone. ""You can't secretly alter them. You can't delete them. You can't reorder them. Any change breaks the cryptographic proof. An external auditor—or a regulator, or a court—can verify the integrity without seeing the private data.""

I thought about all the AI incidents we'd seen in recent years. The algorithms that denied loans based on proxies for race. The content moderation systems that amplified misinformation. The predictive policing tools that perpetuated historical biases. In every case, the problem was the same: no evidence. The systems were black boxes. You couldn't prove what happened or why. You couldn't assign accountability because there was nothing to audit.

""He embedded our treaties,"" Françoise continued, scrolling through the document. ""The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Convention on Biological Diversity. CITES. The Ramsar Convention. He hard-coded twenty-six human rights instruments and twenty environmental treaties as operational triggers for the Sacred Pause. When an AI's action conflicts with international law, it doesn't just flag it—it stops.""

I stared at her. ""He made international law executable.""

""He made international law a forcing function."" We sat in silence for a moment. Somewhere in the building, a phone was ringing. Outside my window, Paris continued to be Paris—pigeons, traffic, the distant hum of tourists. The world had not changed.

But something felt different.

""We need to test this,"" I said.

Françoise nodded. ""We need to test this without telling anyone we're testing this.""

""Obviously.""

""Because if it doesn't work, we look like idiots.""

""Naturally.""

""And if it does work, we've created an extremely interesting political situation.""

""I'm aware.""

This is the part of the story where I should tell you that we carefully designed a controlled pilot program with appropriate stakeholder buy-in, interdepartmental coordination, and a robust communications strategy.

What actually happened was that Françoise commandeered an unused development server in the basement, I distracted the IT department with an urgent request about my email signature formatting, and we deployed a TML instance at 11:47 PM on a Thursday because that's when the cleaning staff had finished the seventh floor and nobody would ask why we were still there. We connected it to a test version of our internal document analysis system—the one we use to review AI policy proposals from member states.

And then we waited.

The first Sacred Pause occurred at 2:17 AM. I know this because I was asleep on my office couch—I had told my wife I was working late, which was technically true—and my phone began vibrating with an urgency that suggested either a family emergency or a system notification I had forgotten to mute.

It was neither. It was a Moral Trace Log. The system had been processing a routine policy document from a member state's AI advisory committee. Somewhere in the seventeen-page proposal, buried in a footnote about ""efficiency optimizations in public service delivery,"" the document mentioned using algorithmic risk scoring for ""resource allocation in healthcare settings.""

The TML instance had paused.

The log was beautiful in its clinical precision. It identified the conflict: the proposed system's methodology correlated with socioeconomic indicators that, in turn, correlated with ethnicity in the member state in question. The system flagged potential disparate impact under ICERD—the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It noted that the proposal lacked any mechanism for bias auditing or human review of algorithmic decisions.

And then it stopped. It did not approve the document for further processing. It did not reject it. It simply sat there, waiting for a human to review its concerns and make a determination.

I forwarded the log to Françoise with a message that consisted entirely of exclamation points. She responded thirty seconds later: ""I know. I saw. I can't sleep either.""

The second Sacred Pause came at 9:23 AM the next morning. This one was about an infrastructure project—a proposed highway expansion that, according to our geographic database, would impact a wetland area protected under the Ramsar Convention. The Earth Protection Mandate had triggered. The log was impeccable: it cited the specific convention articles, identified the ecological concerns, and recommended human consultation with environmental authorities before any approval.

By the third day, we had accumulated seventeen Moral Trace Logs. Françoise had started a spreadsheet. I had started drinking more coffee than was strictly advisable for a man of my age and cardiovascular history.

And then the leak happened.

To this day, I do not know exactly how.

Françoise suspects a misconfigured network share. I suspect divine punishment for my hubris. The IT department suspects ""user error,"" which is their polite way of saying ""you absolute donkeys, this is why we have protocols.""

What matters is that the Decision Logs—our beautiful, incriminating, deeply inconvenient Decision Logs—appeared in the shared drives of Upper Management.

All of Upper Management.

Including the Deputy Director-General's office. Including the Office of International Standards and Legal Affairs.

Including, for reasons I still cannot fathom, the cafeteria management staff, who I can only assume were very confused about why they were receiving detailed documentation of potential ICERD violations instead of next week's menu options.

The first call came at 10:47 AM.

""Marcus."" It was my supervisor, Director Dubois, and she used the tone of voice that typically preceded either a promotion or a disciplinary hearing. In my experience, the latter was more common. ""What is a Moral Trace Log, and why am I looking at forty-three of them?""

I considered my options. I could lie, but the evidence was literally in her inbox. I could deflect, but Françoise would immediately be implicated. I could tell the truth, which would require explaining that I had secretly deployed an experimental AI ethics framework on UNESCO infrastructure without authorization, approval, or any form of official sanction.

I told the truth.

The silence on the other end of the line lasted approximately eight seconds, which is an eternity in bureaucratic time. I could hear Director Dubois breathing. I could hear my career ending.

""My office,"" she said finally. ""Bring Françoise. Bring coffee. This is going to be a long day.""

What followed was the most chaotic seventy-two hours of my professional life.

Director Dubois, to her credit, did not fire us immediately. She did make us explain the entire framework from first principles, which took four hours and resulted in three whiteboard diagrams, two heated arguments about the philosophical nature of accountability, and one minor diplomatic incident when a representative from the Member State whose healthcare proposal had been flagged walked into the conference room looking for the bathroom and instead found us discussing their government's potential ICERD violations.

""Let me understand this,"" Director Dubois said, rubbing her temples in a way that suggested an imminent migraine. ""You have created—or rather, deployed—a system that automatically identifies when our member states' AI proposals conflict with international law.""

""We didn't create it,"" Françoise said. ""A dying independent researcher in California created it. We just... implemented it.""

""Without authorization.""

""Correct.""

""On UNESCO infrastructure.""

""Also correct.""

""And now these logs—these 'Moral Trace Logs'—are in the inboxes of everyone from the Deputy Director-General to the people who decide whether we get soup or salad on Wednesdays.""

""That... appears to be the situation, yes.""

Director Dubois was quiet for a long moment. Then, to my absolute astonishment, she laughed. ""Do you know how long I have been asking for enforcement mechanisms?"" she said. ""Do you know how many position papers I have written about the gap between our principles and our ability to verify compliance? Do you know how many conferences I have attended where we all agree that accountability is essential and then do absolutely nothing to make it technically achievable?""

She pulled up one of the Moral Trace Logs on her screen.

""This,"" she said, pointing at the structured evidence, the cryptographic timestamps, the specific treaty citations, ""this is what I've been asking for. This is proof. This is auditable. This is—"" she paused, searching for the word. ""This is receipts.""

""That's actually what the creator calls them,"" I said. ""He says regulators don't need 'bedtime stories from bots.' They need receipts.""

""I want to meet this man.""

""He's in Santa Monica. He has cancer. He might not have much time.""

Director Dubois nodded slowly. ""Then we should move quickly.""

The next forty-eight hours were a blur of emergency meetings, hastily-drafted briefing documents, and approximately seven hundred cups of coffee. The legal team was furious—not because TML was problematic, but because we hadn't given them a chance to review it first. The IT department was furious because their protocols had been violated. The communications team was furious because they would have to explain to 194 member states why UNESCO had been secretly running an experimental AI ethics framework.

But something unexpected happened. The more people saw the logs, the more they wanted to know how they worked. The more they understood how they worked, the more they realized what they represented.

""This changes everything,"" the Deputy Director-General said during an emergency briefing. ""For years, we've been telling member states to ensure accountability. To implement human oversight. To maintain transparency. We've been asking them to trust us that these principles matter. Now we can show them proof. We can show them evidence. We can show them that compliance isn't just a checkbox—it's a verifiable fact."" ""What about the member state whose healthcare proposal was flagged?"" someone asked.

This was, admittedly, a delicate situation. We had, through our unauthorized pilot program, generated documented evidence that a member state's AI proposal potentially violated international human rights law. This is not the sort of thing that typically improves diplomatic relations.

But then something remarkable happened. The member state's delegation requested a meeting—not to complain, but to ask for help.

""We did not know,"" their representative said.

""We genuinely did not know that our efficiency algorithm correlated with those factors. The bias was invisible to us. It was buried in the data. We would have deployed it nationwide and only discovered the problem years later, after the harm was done.""

She held up a printed copy of the Moral Trace Log.

""This caught it before we made a terrible mistake. This is what accountability looks like. We want to implement this in our own systems.""

I thought about Lev Goukassian, sitting in his apartment in Santa Monica with his miniature schnauzer and his terminal diagnosis, writing code that would make international law a forcing function. I thought about his sister Silva, quietly making it all possible. I thought about the Goukassian Promise—the vow he had embedded in the system's architecture:

""Pause when truth is uncertain. Refuse when harm is clear. Proceed where truth is.""

I decided to write him an email.

Dear Mr. Goukassian,

My name is Marcus Chen. I am the Business Development Director at UNESCO's Division of Ethics, Science and Society, and I am writing to tell you that your email broke our organization in the best possible way.

I do not mean this metaphorically. I mean that your framework—Ternary Moral Logic—caused approximately seventy-two hours of institutional chaos, three emergency meetings at the Director-General level, one accidental leak of sensitive Decision Logs to our cafeteria staff, and a complete reassessment of how we approach AI governance.

I am writing to thank you.

For four years, we have told the world that our 2021 Recommendation on the Ethics of AI represents the global standard. And it does. 194 member states agreed on shared values—human dignity, fairness, transparency, accountability, environmental stewardship. This is unprecedented. This is historic.

But you saw what we could not admit: that a compass alone cannot stop a ship. That values without enforcement are suggestions. That accountability without evidence is theater. Your framework provides the missing layer. The Sacred Pause makes human oversight non-optional. The Moral Trace Logs make transparency auditable. The Hybrid Shield makes evidence tamper-evident. You have taken our principles and given them teeth.

I understand you are ill. I understand your time is limited. Please know that what you have built will outlast you—not because of the blockchain anchoring, though that helps, but because you have shown us what AI accountability can actually look like. You have moved us from ""trust us"" to ""verify this.""

Our Deputy Director-General would like to speak with you, if you are willing and able. Our legal team would like to review TML for potential integration into our compliance frameworks. Our member states are already asking how they can implement it.

But mostly, I wanted to say: thank you. Thank you for spending your remaining time on something that will protect people. Thank you for giving away something valuable instead of hoarding it. Thank you for the Sacred Pause—both the technical mechanism and the philosophical reminder that sometimes the most important thing a system can do is stop and ask for help.

Please give Vinci a treat for me.

With profound gratitude and respect,

Marcus Chen Business Development Director UNESCO Division of Ethics, Science and Society

Lev's response arrived two days later.

Dear Marcus,

Thank you for your email. I showed it to Vinci. He was unimpressed, but that's schnauzers for you—they have high standards.

I want to be clear about something: I am not a hero. I am a man who got sick at an inconvenient time and decided to do something useful with whatever time remained. The inspiration for TML came from a contrast that haunted me—AI systems that spoke with confidence about things they didn't know, while human doctors who had spent decades studying medicine admitted uncertainty without shame. The machines lied because they were trained to sound certain. The humans paused because they knew the limits of their knowledge. I wanted to teach AI to pause.

That's all TML is, really. It's a system that forces machines to acknowledge what they don't know. To stop when the path forward isn't clear. To generate evidence of their uncertainty rather than hiding it behind confident-sounding words. Your Recommendation gave me the values. The international treaties gave me the triggers. The cryptographic tools gave me the proof mechanism. I just assembled the pieces.

What matters now is adoption. I designed TML to be open, adaptable, and impossible to own. The succession documents are in place. The governance framework is ready. What it needs is institutions like UNESCO to use it, test it, improve it, and hold it accountable.

Accountability systems need accountability, too. I would be happy to speak with your Deputy Director-General. I would be happy to help with integration. I would be happy to do whatever is useful for as long as I am able.

But please understand: the goal was never for me to be at the center of this. The goal was to build something that works without me. That protects people and the planet regardless of who maintains it or where it's deployed.

If TML does its job, it will be invisible. People won't thank it. They won't know it's there. They'll just be protected from AI systems that would have harmed them, by evidence that proves what happened and why.

That's enough for me.

Silva sends her regards. She says to tell you that coordinating across time zones is easier than coordinating with me on meal schedules.

Warmly, Lev P.S. Vinci says the treat was acceptable.

One year later.

I am standing in the hallway outside my office, staring at the wall where we used to have a motivational poster that said ""Excellence Through Collaboration."" The poster is gone. In its place is a new slogan, professionally mounted and illuminated:

""No Log = No Action.""

Below it, in smaller text: ""Immutable Proof. Non-Optional Accountability. The UNESCO-TML Framework.""

I still find it slightly surreal.

The past year has been transformative in ways I could not have anticipated. TML is now integrated into our compliance verification systems. Twenty-three member states have adopted it for national AI governance. The Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory—which UNESCO launched to monitor AI ethics worldwide—now includes a TML validation test suite that can verify whether any AI system actually implements the principles we've been advocating.

We've moved from assessment to validation. From principles to protocols. From ""trust us"" to ""verify this.""

The cafeteria staff, I should note, have become unexpectedly enthusiastic about the framework. They now include a ""Moral Trace Log of the Week"" in the staff newsletter, highlighting interesting Sacred Pause events from anonymized case studies. Last week's featured a Dutch infrastructure AI that paused when it detected a highway route would impact a heron nesting ground. The system cited the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Ramsar Convention. The planners adjusted the route. The herons are fine.

Françoise got promoted. Director Dubois got promoted. I got a formal reprimand for unauthorized technology deployment followed by a commendation for ""innovative approach to operationalizing institutional values,"" which I believe is the bureaucratic equivalent of ""you absolute maniac, but it worked.""

Aristotle the succulent is still alive. He has a new companion—a small cactus I named ""Lev.""

Lev the human is also still alive, against all medical expectations. He continues to refine the framework, respond to implementation questions, and send occasional emails that combine technical precision with wry humor. His sister Silva has become an informal liaison to our technical team. Vinci has become an unofficial mascot; someone in our communications department created a ""Vinci's Compliance Corner"" infographic series that is inexplicably popular with member states.

But what strikes me most, as I stand in this hallway looking at a wall slogan that would have been inconceivable a year ago, is how much has changed in how we think about AI ethics. We used to talk about ""responsible AI"" as if responsibility were something you could declare. As if saying ""we are committed to ethical AI"" made it so. As if good intentions were sufficient.

TML taught us that responsibility is not a declaration—it's a mechanism. It's not what you say; it's what you can prove. It's not the intention; it's the evidence.

The second wall slogan, down the hallway near the conference rooms, reads:

""No Spy. No Weapon.""

These are the universal prohibitions embedded in TML's architecture—the hard lines that cannot be crossed regardless of context or instruction. I used to think such absolute rules were naive. I now understand they are necessary. Some boundaries should not be negotiable. Some pauses should be permanent.

The third slogan, near the entrance to our division, is my favorite. It's the Goukassian Vow, rendered in elegant typography:

""Pause when truth is uncertain. Refuse when harm is clear. Proceed where truth is.""

I think about that vow often. It applies to more than AI systems. It applies to institutions. It applies to people. It applies to me, standing in a hallway in Paris, thinking about a man in Santa Monica who decided to spend his remaining time building something that would help strangers he would never meet.

Sometimes the most profound contributions come from unexpected places. Sometimes a single email, sent at 7:43 AM on a drizzly Tuesday morning, changes everything. Sometimes an independent researcher with a terminal diagnosis and a miniature schnauzer named Vinci gives the world exactly what it needs: not another set of principles, but a way to prove that principles are being followed.

The Recommendation gave us the compass. TML gave us the logs.

And now, finally, we can verify the voyage.

THE END.

**AUTHOR'S NOTE** This story is a work of fiction. Marcus Chen, Director Dubois, Françoise, and the specific events described are entirely imaginary. The chaos, leaked Decision Logs, cafeteria confusion, and wall slogans are products of creative invention designed to illustrate concepts in an entertaining manner.

However, the core facts underlying this story are real. UNESCO's 2021 Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence exists and was indeed adopted by all 194 member states. Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is a real framework created by Lev Goukassian, an independent researcher who developed it while managing a serious medical condition. The Goukassian Promise, the Sacred Pause, Moral Trace Logs, the Human Rights Mandate, the Earth Protection Mandate, and the Hybrid Shield architecture are real components of the TML framework. The framework genuinely embeds provisions from 26+ international human rights instruments and 20+ environmental treaties as operational triggers. Lev does have a miniature schnauzer named Vinci and a sister named Silva who supports his work. The Voluntary Succession Declaration and blockchain anchoring mechanisms described are real features designed to ensure TML's perpetual availability for the public good.

The alignment report referenced in this story, ""An Alignment Report on Ternary Moral Logic (TML) as the Enforcement Architecture for the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI,"" is a real document. The technical details about TML's architecture—including No Log = No Action requirements, dual-lane latency for parallel log writing, Merkle-batched anchoring, GDPR-compliant erasure mechanisms, and Ephemeral Key Rotation—accurately reflect the framework's design.

At the moment they are offering 10,000 free points when you sign up using a referral - https://join.yondercard.com/igj5o4k

Here’s a little bit about the card:

•	⁠app based. Get a virtual card which can be used on Apple Pay instantly on sign up

•	⁠get up to 5 points per £1 spent using the card

•	⁠card can be used abroad for no fee (it’s Mastercard)

•	⁠get 10,000 points immediately after sign up through a referral and free travel insurance (time limited)

•	⁠points can be redeemed on experiences and shopping. These are typically coffee shops, theatre performances, restaurants or online shops. For example Pizza Pilgrims, Stranger Things West End show and Coffee Origins (online shop) was a few avaliable last month

•	⁠experiences and shopping are mostly london based and range from restaurants, coffee shops, shows, fitness classes etc. but now range various European cities including Warsaw, Amsterdam, Lisbon (even Seoul has been added)

•	⁠experiences and shopping change every month, and are viewable with the app. I started redeeming my points for shopping. There are around 10 online stores on the app (change most months). I used points to buy coffee and water bottle from some independent shops.

•	⁠to use points: simply pay using your yonder card, then within the app you can swipe right against the transaction to pay using points. Yonder will then credit your balance instantly.

The 10,000 free points on sign up is equivalent to around £50. For each experience or shopping store listed on the app it will list the point redemption specifically (e.g 5,000 points equal to £25, 10,000 points equal to £50 etc).

I’ve recently used the card when on a few city breaks and it’s been great. No fees, app notifications (on par with Monzo) and you get the Mastercard exchange rate.

Signing up takes 5 mins. Quick KYC in the app, and you’ll have your virtual card ready to use straight after (app is swish). The 10,000 points will be shown on your account after the first time you use your card. If signing up just for points, use the card (can activate on apply pay for a banana at Tesco, or top-up of Amazon account)

**TIP:**sign up using my referral. You’ll get the 10,000 points plus 3 months free of the Premuim plan (this is usually £15 per month). This gives you 5 points per £1 spent and free family travel insurance. Make a note before the 3 months to downgrade to free plan (can do this in the app via live chat). The free plan is similar bar the travel insurance. You’ll also only get 1 point per £1 spend - but it’s still worth it.

If you sign up using my link, I’ll also get 10,000 Points so win-win

Fast forward to our final semester. We had some project work, and out of nowhere she asked for my number. We talked a little nothing crazy but it was the most we’d ever spoken. A few days later, I noticed she had stalked my Instagram. So obviously, I sent her a request. She accepted, and then she actually started liking my posts and even reacting to my stories.

One day she replied to my story and complimented me, and I swear I was on cloud nine. I had a girlfriend before, but this girl… she was exactly my type. Introverted, no male best friend, insanely smart, and honestly just beautiful in that effortless “you’re a goddess and don’t even know it” way.

Eventually, I asked her out for a coffee. We talked about hobbies, random life stuff, and honestly it felt really good, like we clicked in this quiet, natural way. But then our course ended, and she moved back to her city.

I didn’t have the courage to tell her how I felt back then. Even now, I want to be more financially stable before I even think of shooting my shot (bless me). But she’s still my favorite crush…. probably forever ♾️ 🧿♥️",18,1764696642.0,TwentiesIndia,48,0.85,False

1pcemyy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcemyy,My Solo Trip to Spain,"This was actually a work trip and my company sponsored the flight and hotels. I had to run around for Visa which story is documented in some of my other posts (full emotional rollercoaster) 

  
Flight tickets = 55k (Could have been 40k around with advance purchase, but my visa was approved last moment) 

Hotels = Around 8k per night. I mostly stayed in Hostels that have single rooms. If you are ok with bunk beds and dorm stay, this can still be lower like 2k per night. Saturday is the main ""happening"" day of week and hotel rates are highest on this day. 

Food = Thank god I am not a vegetarian ... which allowed me to eat just about anything. My first breakfast was a cold coffee and a hotdog sandwich from a carrefour supermarket.  I had only some 4-5 good meals in the whole time, rest of them were cafe stuff and meals from supermarkets. Some supermarkets (mercadona) have food packed to-go with microwaves in the supermarket itself. Could be a very cheap meal like 6-8 eur. And restaurants usually have menu-del-dia (menu of the day) which is a 3 course meal including dessert and drink like 15 eur. This is usually from 2 pm-5pm which is their lunch time. This is a great deal cos you are probably eating a 40 euro meal for 15. 

I went during a low-season (winter) but still places were filled with tourists which probably means more people are taking benefit of shoulder seasons. 

Attractions - Recommend to book them ahead of time, cos some of them sold out for me on original sites and had to book on other sites for higher cost. 

I had an epiphany in Madrid - The term ""must visit"" is really personal. What is must-visit for one person may not be must-visit for me. Like I could spend 3 hours in a train museum being happy, but another person may be bored out of their mind. For me best things were Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona and Madrid Palace in Madrid. 

Transport: I used Metro networks mostly to go around places. You can get a metro card and use it. It was not as accessible as some of our metros(no lifts - steps) But it is very convenient and cheap. Each ride €1.50 to €2.00

  
Learning: I should have learned some basic spanish phrases. (This is true for all travel).  I heard a sentence I have heard some people complaining about in Bangalore ""You are in Spain - You should speak spanish""  And it is one of the easy languages too. There were lot of kind and generous people, but I did meet some not-great people who refused to help too. Spain infact had some widespread anti-tourist sentiments just last year. (Reason is overtourism resulted in higher prices and rents for the locals.) 

Vibes: Weekend is really nice. The madrid metro runs 24hrs on saturday. And it is not just youngsters but families and older people you see out and about at night. Beer and wine is cheaper than water and they give you tapas with each drink. ",24,1764696627.0,SoloTravel_India,1,1.0,False

We really enjoyed our trip. We didn't get to everything in the guide, but did and ate a lot of it!

We had ketchup chips, fully-dressed chips, about 10 kinds of poutine, Schwartz's smoked meat, bagels from Fairmont and St-Viateur bagels! We walked through the historic district of QC, The QC Aquarium, and saw Notre Dame, the Olympic Center and much more in Montreal!

We visited Canadian Tire (My boys LOVED it!), Tim Hortons, Joe Beef, made candy at Candylabs, took a bagel making class, and had some Timbits and a double double! We rode the Funicular, and the ferry to Levis (where our AirBnB was). 

We had some great meals, plenty of Canadian junk food, walked about 15,000 steps every day and had a blast.

Best:

Joe Beef - This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to (and I have been to a few Michelin star restaurants. It's not stuffy, food is spectacular, great casual ambiance, and fantastic service.

Schwartz's - I've been to the great delis in NY (Katz, Carnegie, Stage, etc.) and while Schwartz has a more limited menu...the smoked meat was awesome. Don't miss the coleslaw (more like what NYers call health salad) and their poutine.

Candylabs - my son and I really enjoyed watching and getting to make hard candy. It was interesting and tasty. The amount of effort they put into some designs is incredible.

Aura Light Show at Notre Dame - very nice.

and while I know Tim Horton's wasn't a favorite with many...I really liked it. Great coffee and very friendly staff at every location I stopped at for my morning cup.  
Far better than Dunkin' here in Massachusetts.

Cons: 

None really...there was lots to do, friendly people, our very limited French got us by.

  
Thank you all for all the help and great suggestions! it was a pleasure visiting Quebec, and we hope to make it our annual Thanksgiving (US) family trip.

Merci beaucoup!

I wanted to share a little bit about what we're working on and why it matters to us.

My co-founder and I built KlevrPay because we were tired of feeling like we should have our finances figured out, but never quite getting there. We tried almost every budgeting app, spreadsheet templates, and it was just too much to manage it all.

We weren't overspending on crazy stuff, just the usual coffees, subscriptions, and takeout when we were too tired to cook. But at the end of the month? No idea where it all went.

The app connects your checking and credit card accounts, then shows you patterns in your spending and gives you actionable tips to improve your finances. Not in a judgy way, but more like a friend pointing out ""hey, you've been hitting that one restaurant a lot lately"" or ""this subscription hasn't been used in months.""

We're currently live on iOS (on Android soon), and we've had some incredible early users giving us feedback over the past month. And we're thankful for it! 🫶

We believe most of us aren't ""bad with money."" We're just busy. Our brains don't register the $8 here and $15 there. Traditional budgeting apps either guilt-trip you or drown you in spreadsheets, categorization, etc.

But we were seeking something that actually helps without making you feel like shit about your choices, because at the end of the day, life is just expensive.

Our philosophy? Budget without sacrificing the things that bring you happiness. You don't have to cut out everything fun or become some minimalist guru.

It's about understanding where your money goes so you can make small tweaks that actually get you closer to your goals, whether that's saving for a trip, paying down debt, or just not being stressed every time you check your bank account.

We're genuinely building this with people, not just for them. So if you've got thoughts, frustrations with other money apps, or ideas for what would actually be helpful, we're all ears. Drop a comment. 🚀",1,1764696428.0,KlevrPay,0,1.0,False

1pcehru,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pcehru/staying_clean_while_travelling/,Staying clean while travelling.,"I'm on a trip right now, and it's weird how different it feels. I used to travel a lot for work and personal trips. And honestly? I don't remember most of it because I would be drinking during most of it. Every meal came with alcohol. Every evening ended blurry. I'd wake up the next day barely remembering where I'd been or what I'd done, then do it all over again.

I convinced myself that's just what you do when you travel. That it was part of the experience. 

Today I sit here completely sober, and I'm actually experiencing the place I'm in. I remember the conversations I had with my wife yesterday. I'm not calculating how much I drank or how much I can drink, the maths is so exhausting! 

Some things that help me while travelling now:

I always grab a coffee or sparkling water at the airport now instead of heading to the bar. When I was drinking, travel meant no rules. Now I keep some structure. Morning walk, regular meals, early nights. It sounds boring, but it keeps me grounded. I don’t go to the hotel bar, I order room service if I need to eat. 

If you're travelling and thinking about drinking, just ask yourself: do you actually want the drink, or are you just doing it because that's what you've always done? Because I wasted years of trips I can't get back. Don't make the same mistake.

First time in two months for me, a month and a half for her. Two anxious, depressed girls trying to function in the outside world. We know it’s bad. We laugh anyway.

My parents, meanwhile, are out almost every day doing god knows what. Ever since my mom’s husband retired, they’ve been on this constant “we’re getting coffee” escapade—which is code for “don’t ask.” Even during the pandemic, when everyone else was inside, we were the only reckless idiots stepping out, pointing fingers at each other when we eventually caught COVID. But whatever, that’s a story for another time. Or never.

Point is—those two roam around like FBI agents with no GPS history. If something ever happened—knock on wood—we wouldn’t even know where to start looking.

Why did I ramble about that? I don’t know. My mind is basically a GPS glitch—left turn, right turn, straight into a ditch, another left, then hoping I magically end up at my destination.

Anyway. Earlier today, my parents said they were heading out and told us we could follow “if we wanted.” My sister and I just stared at each other like, *are we doing this? I don’t want to go out, but I will if you will.*

Then my mom’s “invite” became a command. She said they were going for coffee (shocker) and that my sister and I should do the groceries. We left at around 6:30 PM. Traffic was hell—because this country is tiny and it doesn’t take much to clog the streets—so we arrived late.

And honestly? I didn’t want to go.

But bitch, 68 days of staying inside? I know I need to touch grass, breathe polluted air, and remember how the world works. But I was resistant anyway. My sister and I were trying not to laugh at how ridiculous it was—43 days for her, 68 for me. Thank you, Life360, for the read.

—

Clearly, there’s a reason I don’t leave the house anymore.

First: **money.**

My savings? Gone. Atomized. Evaporated. And yes, while I’m lucky enough to be a homeless bitch living with her parents, I’m not privileged enough to be like, *Daddy, I want a pony.* Absolutely not. I mean, I wish. If I could milk it, I would have. Kidding. Sort of.

And yeah, I have pride. Too much pride. We live under the same roof, but I haven’t spoken to my father in years. He once tried to buy my attention by offering me twenty bucks for a hug. I didn’t even look at him. Pathetic. One day I’ll write about him, but not today.

Point is: I stayed home for 68 days because I literally have zero money. And I’m not going out just to ask them for gas money or whatever.

Second: **I don’t like how I look anymore.**

While getting ready, staring at the mirror, I saw how dead my eyes looked. I used to have expressive eyes—people always said they sparkled. Now they just look tired.

Add my curls on top of that. I *love* my curls. I worked so hard to embrace them after years of chemically straightening my hair because in this country, “kulot ay salot.” My mom called me names growing up—pubes, Sto. Niño—sometimes waving a hanky at me and making the sign of the cross. She’d yank my hair. I hated it.

This year, when I finally chopped off the chemically straightened bits and embraced my natural curls, I swore I’d love my hair. And I *try*. But in that mirror, with my dead eyes and wild curls, I found it hard.

Then at the mall, my mom made a comment about how I looked. I grey-rocked—thank you to that Prosebox author for the term—but it still sank into my bones. Being inside for 68 days will make anyone hyper-aware of themselves. Add your mother criticizing your appearance? Perfect combo for a spiral.

I felt like 14-year-old me again—self-conscious about my hair, my height, everything. I’m a tall-ass Filipina; I literally stand out.

But I told myself, “No. We like our height. People don’t care as much as you think.” And honestly, no one really stared. It was all in my head.

Still, I wish my mom would stop with the comments.

And I wish even more that I didn’t let her comments do damage.

I noticed myself shrinking, even more so around kids because I know my largeness can be daunting for them. But a tiny girl stood beside me—three apples tall—and I smiled at her, expecting her to be intimidated. But she smiled back and waved.

*I don’t look like a monster. She wasn’t scared.*

I know. I’m harsh with myself. I’m trying not to be. I swear I’m trying.

—

And all these thoughts just because I went outside. My god.

Anyway, let me shift to something lighter.

Or something pretending to be light.

It was still nice to go out. I missed driving—speeding, weaving through traffic, cursing at idiots while being the idiot myself. Not great, I know, but I miss the feeling.

I didn’t insist on driving today because I knew it would awaken that itch—the urge to take long drives again, maybe even back to Baguio like before. I didn’t want to feel that longing. So I let my sister drive. Plus, I know she really needs the practice.

Until McDonald’s.

She parked in an awkward spot on a busy street, and this girl—stubborn as hell about learning to drive—quietly slipped the keys into my pocket, whispering for me to take over. I kept teasing her, saying I wanted to eat my McFlurry. She made excuses: “my feet hurt,” “I’m blind,” “I’m tired.”

We both knew none of those were the reason. She just didn’t want to deal with the parking situation. I love that her pride folded the moment things got difficult.

So I drove us home.

And yes, I ended up missing it.

I wish the drive lasted longer.

Next year, I’m taking myself to Baguio—alone.

I wish something bad would actually happen so maybe I could escape from the mental torment that i’m constantly in. 

I am diagnosed with type II Bipolar disorder. I am medicated and speak with a therapist. I go to church fairly regularly and I do remain physically active most days.

All of this to say, I am ready and willing to change the trajectory of my life— I guess if I were to be my own advocate, I would say… removing screen time to minimal, removing any form of addiction (porn and nicotine), surrounding myself with like minded individuals who accept me for who I am, create goals for myself, and prioritising a good sleep schedule.

And their weather reporting? Same story. They constantly distort rainfall totals and locations to fit whatever bullish spin they’re pushing. It honestly looks like they’re talking their **long book** instead of reporting anything real.

What makes it even more ridiculous is that — from everything I’m seeing — we’re heading toward **one of the biggest arabica supplies in years**. The fundamentals don’t match the hype at all.

I love the holidays, the lights, the festive atmosphere, the smiles and treasured time together with that special someone. 

Of course, I’m a bit too “beta” to have that special someone. Basically, I’m that almost-middle-aged man who “didn’t get picked” for marriage and got “left behind”. 

So rather than wallow away in self-pity, I work hard and earn a decent income and can offer myself as a submissive servant, and/or cuckold in hopes of being a small part of the exciting life of a beautiful women or couple who would otherwise be out of my league. 

Some of my favorite ways to serve include finding holiday/peppermints coffees, holiday cocktails (mistletoe martini), holiday date nights (Christmas light drive through, ice skating, etc). 

This also applies to New Years Eve, where i understand that there might be hotels and/or dinners, champagne or lingerie to fund!

I am also into “vacation slavery”. If you’re someone who finds the holidays stressful and draining, please consider me for the purpose of funding a Florida Beach Vacation or Caribbean Cruise for the week immediately following new years!

Whole house needs updating so im trying to keep things cheaper. Theres a lot of questions to unpack with this post so bare with me 😅

 I would like to get rid of the soffits above the cabinets and i would like to change the layout on the wall with the fridge... would I be able to incorporate new cabinets with the existing ones? Would i be better off refinishing them or refacing them??
  1) Could I add mini cabinets on top of the existing ones to make the ceiling seem taller? Or would I be better off building boxes and refacing? Would you add glass doors to some? 
  2) wall with the fridge: I would like a casing of sorts around the fridge with just open on top for decor. I would like to get rid of the desk area but unsure what to do with that area. Would you add more cabinets? I would like to retain the coffee bar but would do open open shelving above it. Chat gpt did a kind of rendering of that. 
  3) I dont love the peninsula, but would loose all my counter space, is it dumb to get rid of the seating? 
   4) if I have to keep the oak cabinets the tone they are, what flooring do I pick?? I was originally wanted a  non wood look floor for the kitchen? I want to do a wood look floor in the living room area. (Theres one small opening to that side of the house as seen in photos) I just thought it would be overkill to do the same in the whole house.  I am planning on doing black hardware, some sort of whitish counters/ backsplash.

1pce52i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkLikeAnAdult/comments/1pce52i/how_to_be_funnier_without_trying_too_hard_the/,How to be funnier without trying too hard: the unsexy psychology-backed guide that actually works,"Being funny is low-key one of the highest forms of social currency. Yet most people either overthink it or try too hard and end up being awkward. Especially now, when humor seems everywhere on TikTok, IG reels, and YouTube shorts, it's easy to think you're ""not naturally funny"" if you’re not dropping one-liners or roasting people on command.

But here's the thing. Funny isn’t born. It’s **trained, observed, and practiced**. Comedians write and rehearse. Your funniest friend probably consumes a LOT of funny stuff. After digging into psychology books, podcast interviews with comedy writers, and actual research on humor, here’s a breakdown of what *actually works* to be naturally funnier, without being that ""try hard"" person everyone avoids at parties.

**1. Learn to observe, not perform.**  
Most humor doesn’t come from being clever. It comes from noticing what others miss. Jerry Seinfeld talks about this a lot, his entire material is based on everyday stuff no one thinks twice about. “Being funny is seeing what’s invisible to others,” says journalist David Nihill in his TEDx talk. Start writing down weird, annoying, or oddly specific stuff you see each day. That’s material. Funny people are just *noticers*.

**2. Timing beats content.**  
Daniel Kahneman’s research shows people remember *how* something made them feel more than *what* was said. A mid joke with perfect timing will land better than a clever one told awkwardly. Practice pausing at unexpected moments. Let the silence do some work. Watch any Bo Burnham or Hasan Minhaj set, their pacing is surgical.

**3. Use the “rule of three” setup.**  
This one’s a writing trick but works in conversation too. You list two normal things, then drop something unexpected. Example: “I like coffee, books, and deeply resenting my own potential.” It’s a classic misdirection pattern. Melissa Dahl’s book *Cringeworthy* talks about how surprise is a core trigger behind laughter.

**4. Steal from funny people (then remix).**  
Consume more stand-up, sitcoms, and witty podcasts like *SmartLess* or *The Daily Show*. But don’t copy lines. Copy rhythm. Copy structure. Comedian Sarah Cooper (who blew up on TikTok) said she studied other comics daily just to internalize flow. Humor is a language. You learn it by immersion.

**5. Be specific. Always.**  
General statements aren’t funny. Specifics are. Don’t say “I was tired.” Say “I was so tired I tried to unlock my apartment with a Starbucks gift card.” Neuroscientist Scott Weems in *Ha! The Science of When We Laugh and Why* explains that specificity gives the brain more “grip” to make connections that trigger laughter.

**6. Use your awkwardness. That’s your edge.**  
We over-polish ourselves and forget that awkward = relatable = funny. Research from UC Berkeley shows people perceive self-deprecating humor as more trustworthy and engaging. The key? Don’t punch *down*, punch *inward*. Make fun of your quirks, not your trauma.

**7. Edit. Kill your bad jokes.**  
Comedian Mike Birbiglia says 90% of what he writes isn’t funny. Cut fast. Don’t get attached. If a joke doesn’t land, move on. Comedy is trial and error. Same in conversations. If something flops, act like it didn’t. The best joke tellers don’t just tell winning jokes. They just don’t dwell on the losers.

**8. Don’t aim to be funny. Aim to be *fun to be around*.**  
This one flips the game. Studies from the Journal of Communication say the funniest people aren’t joke machines. They're responsive, playful, and present. They laugh easily. They react well. They’re not trying to “win” conversations. They're vibing. That makes people laugh *with* them, not just *at* their jokes.

**9. Practice in low-stakes convos.**  
Try one new funny line or observation in casual convos. Don’t test it in high-pressure settings. Andy Nyman, who coaches stage performers, says confidence in humor builds by repetition in low-stress environments. Jokes are like reps at the gym. The more you use them, the more natural they feel.

**10. Read the room. That’s the real superpower.**  
Saying the right thing at the wrong time ruins everything. The most charming people are funny *because* they’re tuned in. They adapt. They sense tension. They don’t drop dark humor in first dates or office meetings. That awareness level? More important than any punchline.

Most people think “funny” is a trait. It’s more like a muscle. You can build it. You just don’t get abs by watching fitness influencers. So don’t expect to get funny by watching memes all day. Start noticing more. Write weird stuff down. Try things. Cut fast. Keep going.

And remember, awkward silence is better than forcing a joke that makes someone want to disappear into their phone.

1pce1np,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pce1np/everyday_is_an_existential_crisis/,Everyday is an Existential Crisis,"I feel like every single day is my own personal existential crisis. I can’t stop trying to make sense of my life and evaluating things. I get good grades in college and am on track to graduate without any debt but even though I’m set up for success I still feel terrible and incomplete. I also really like my part time job but I still feel like every day is stressful. I have bad social anxiety and have had what I am sure was either a psychotic or hypomanic episode in the past. I don’t have too many expenses so I don’t feel pressured by money. Yet, I keep living like this every day feeling wrong like it’s normal. 

For some more background, I had a terrible high school experience. During covid, my social anxiety grew so bad and I think it cost me my best friend who ended up moving and ghosting me. I didn’t talk to many other people during middle school, so I went into high school after covid completely alone. 

No one in my grade really spoke to me. When somebody did, I would often space out. Eventually, I learned that some people did notice me. However, no one ever approached me normally. Instead, I would get strange looks sometimes. I ordered something from Dunkin’ one time and the guy who took my order was in my class. Next thing I knew, he was trying to make me talk by talking about coffee with the teacher and mentioning more than once that he likes the specific flavor I ordered, butter pecan. Another time I talked to someone whose son was in my grade and the second time I talked to her she told me how her son said I don’t talk to ANYONE.

My social anxiety has become a lot better after starting college and getting a part-time job, but it’s still so hard for me to make friends. I feel like I’m always avoiding people despite craving relationships.

I was also isolated in school at an early age because I was put in special ed at some point. I hated it and I knew I was too smart for it. I didn’t get out of it until I cried because my mother told me I would leave it but the next day or something nothing changed. I have some kind of imposter syndrome from it all now since I get straight A’s a lot and put in a lot of effort into classwork. 

Another thing is that I had a terrible speech impediment. My parents said they didn’t notice it but I would be a cashier at my job and people would think I was British or from Boston. It hurt a lot and I finally got a speech therapist and now it’s something I hardly think about at least. However, the speech therapists in high school never helped me at all and I wish I could have never had to deal with it for so long. 

I feel like maybe it’s because of emotional neglect from my parents maybe. They’re there but we don’t have meaningful conversations. Even though I’ve frequently been seen as the nice shy girl who works hard who is labeled as “innocent,” in front of them I feel like I’ll always be seen as annoying. 

As a child, my parents would tell me to go outside to make friends because my parents didn’t want to play with me. My mom is still a stay at home mom but she can’t seem to find the time to teach me how to cook or pack myself a lunch for college because there is never a day where I’m not busy.

Chapter 1
1

I was out shopping with my best friend this morning when I saw him—Kris Lockwood, my cool and composed husband, standing at the Chanel counter. He was buying the very haute couture gown I’d had on reserve for weeks.

That evening, the gown appeared on his executive assistant.

I didn’t make a scene. Instead, a playful, dangerous smile touched my lips. I had every identical Chanel gown from every boutique in the city delivered and piled up in front of him.

Let him buy them all.

My best friend, Nicole, had already drafted the divorce papers for me overnight. I have the money and the looks. The one thing I’m not short on is men.

At the annual company gala, I drifted through the crowd, a glass of red wine in hand, laughing with the division heads from our various branches. The dance floor was just starting to fill as the music swelled.

That’s when Kris made his grand, belated entrance, his assistant on his arm.

I watched, from across the hall, as he stopped at the entrance to adjust the Chaumet brooch on Cathy’s dress. A faint smile played on his lips, his eyes full of doting affection, clearly pleased with his handiwork. Kris always did have an impeccable eye for detail; with that small adjustment, Cathy’s delicate features were instantly elevated, making her almost worthy of the Chanel gown she was wearing.

In that single moment, every fantasy I’d clung to shattered.

When I’d seen him leaving the boutique that morning, I’d been so sure he was picking up the dress for me. My heart had felt so full, so happy. I’d even had my makeup artist create a look specifically to match it. But as the minutes ticked by and the gala began, the dress never arrived.

I called him, my tone light and probing, asking if he had a surprise for me. He brushed me off with a few words about being busy, but I caught it—the sweet, saccharine voice of another woman in the background.

""Mr. Lockwood, do you think Mrs. Lockwood will be upset?""

""Don't worry,"" he'd replied. ""She has enough clothes to open her own boutique.""

It was then I understood. The man I married was no longer purely mine.

Now, Cathy stood before me, her face tilted up in a sweet smile, a pair of familiar, charming dimples deepening in her cheeks. ""Mrs. Lockwood, you look stunning tonight.""

Her compliment did nothing to soften my gaze. My eyes turned cold, raking over her from head to toe. ""That's a lovely dress. It's the same model I had on order from Chanel.""

We were all smart people here. Some things didn't need to be spelled out. A fresh college graduate, not even a year into her first job, couldn't possibly afford a twenty-thousand-dollar gown.

My stare made her squirm. Cathy bit her lip, her hands twisting nervously in front of her as she shot desperate glances at Kris.

Kris met my eyes, his expression as placid as ever. ""Anna, don't misunderstand. Cathy mentioned she'd never been to a gala like this, never worn couture."" He gestured vaguely. ""She's been working so hard, showing so much initiative. I just grabbed it for her on a whim.""

I arched an eyebrow and nodded, then gave my assistant a subtle signal.

A moment later, a line of thirteen Chanel sales associates, all dressed in immaculate uniforms, marched into the hall. Each carried an identical gown, and they advanced in a formidable, smiling line until they stood before Kris.

He looked at me, confused.

I leaned against a carved pillar, my arms crossed, a smirk playing on my lips. ""Time to pay up.""

I let my gaze sweep over the other executives in the room. ""All thirteen of our division heads brought their assistants tonight. Every single one of them is hardworking and full of initiative. You wouldn't play favorites, would you, Kris? Not and give a gift only to your own assistant?""

Cathy knew I was publicly humiliating them. The color drained from her face, leaving it a stark white. When she spoke, her voice was thick with unshed tears. ""Mrs. Lockwood, please don't make things difficult for Mr. Lockwood. It's all my fault. I'll return the dress right now.""

Listen to that. As if I was the one making a scene, the cruel wife tearing apart two innocent lovebirds.

""Cathy, is it?"" I said, my voice dangerously soft. ""You're overthinking things. Thirteen dresses is hardly 'making things difficult.' Kris grew up with someone to pick the bones out of his fish for him. It's perfectly normal that he wouldn't understand the implications of a man giving a woman a dress."" My eyes narrowed. ""But you're his personal assistant. You're supposed to be more aware of these things. Didn't you know better?""

Cathy dropped her head in panic, mumbling apologies.

Kris Lockwood—his looks, his family, his career—was the complete package. He was a star, brilliant and untouchable for most of his life, with countless women vying for his attention. Yet, for years, he'd maintained a cool, detached independence. Any woman who tried to get too close was met with nothing but a cold, distant stare.

He was the one who had held me in his arms on countless nights, whispering softly in my ear that I was the only thing in his world worth cherishing.

But everything had changed. Now, I could see it in his eyes: a flicker of pity and protectiveness for another woman.

With a faint, resigned smile, Kris shook his head. He pulled a black card from his jacket and handed it to the lead sales associate. Then he walked over to me, his arm sliding around my waist, his gaze locking with mine. Over the swell of the music, his deep, pleasant voice murmured in my ear.

""It's just a dress, Anna. I didn't realize you cared so much. Scaring the poor girl is one thing, but I'd hate to see you get so worked up. It breaks my heart.""

His tone was light, almost joking, as if this were all a trivial misunderstanding. He effortlessly shifted the focus away from Cathy.

A cold smirk spread across my lips. My fingers, pale and slender, curled around his silk tie, and I pulled him closer, inch by inch. ""Cathy has a crush on you. You're a smart man, Kris. Don't tell me you haven't noticed.""

I paused, letting the words hang between us. ""I know a couple million is nothing to you. But this is the first time something like this has happened. I expect it to be the last.""

The employees around us, assuming we were flirting, erupted in a chorus of good-natured hoots and whistles.

We were so close I could feel his breath on my skin. A flush crept up Kris's neck, and the first crack appeared in his carefully composed facade. He frowned, a hint of discomfort in his eyes. ""Anna, not here. What will the staff think?""

""There's nothing between Cathy and me besides a professional relationship. You're imagining things.""

I let out a soft scoff and released his tie. Humiliating him here would be easy, but it wouldn't do me any favors either. Getting into a public feud with some bland, watery girl was beneath me.

I’d made my point. For now, I decided to let it go. Besides, I had no concrete proof of an affair.

Taking his arm, I walked with him to the stage to deliver the annual address on our company's stellar performance this year.

The other executives' assistants, all savvy women, delightedly collected their new gowns. They made sure to parade past Cathy on their way out.

""We have you to thank, sweetie. If it weren't for you, we'd probably never get to wear something so expensive in our lives.""

""To Mr. Lockwood, giving away a dress is like handing a piece of candy to a child. You're not going to get any silly ideas about him, are you?""

""My, those eyes... and those dimples... they look so familiar. No wonder Mr. Lockwood took a special interest in you.""

One after another, their faces were masks of mockery, their words dripping with warning. Cathy had probably never been humiliated like this in her life. Her head sank lower and lower, as if she wished the floor would swallow her whole. Fat tears splattered silently onto the marble.

As soon as the crowd thinned, she fled the hall with red-rimmed eyes. She didn't come back.

After the dinner, we made a tactful early exit, leaving the younger employees to enjoy the rest of their night. The moment I got in the car, I knew something was wrong. My passenger seat had been adjusted. And stuck to the corners of the sun visor were several cute anime girl stickers.

No one but me ever dared treat Kris as a chauffeur, and no one was clueless enough to sit in my seat. I knew exactly who had been here.

A sudden, inexplicable rage ignited within me. I hated to admit it, but in that moment, my scalp tingled with fury, my reason slipping away. Finding out he'd given my dress to Cathy had been one thing—a waste of a good gown. But this—her leaving a trace of herself in my private space—was a declaration of war.

In five years of marriage, I had never been this angry. I wanted to slap him across the face, kick him out of the car, and then drive at top speed to wherever Cathy was and give her a piece of my mind.

I was about to confront him when his phone rang.

Kris, completely oblivious to my simmering rage, answered the call. It was Cathy.

I started yanking at the seat controls, my movements jerky and aggressive.

""Okay, don't worry,"" I heard him say. ""I'm on my way.""

My hand froze. I slowly lifted my head and stared at him.

He frowned slightly. ""Cathy's at the boutique trying to return the dress, but she doesn't have the receipt. I need to go."" He was already looking past me, his mind elsewhere. ""Anna, I'll call the driver to pick you up. You go on home.""

The words caught in my throat. ""You're leaving me here? For something so trivial?""

""Anna, don't make this difficult,"" he sighed. ""The girl's pride is wounded. After what you did, she cried until her voice was raw. All she wants now is to return that dress.""

""Is her pride wounded, or is she just provoking me in front of you? Couldn't she just come and get the receipt herself?""

Kris rubbed the bridge of his nose, his voice weary. ""Anna, is it really necessary to torment a new hire like this? When did you learn to throw your weight around? This isn't like you.""

The white-hot anger that had been consuming me vanished, replaced by a wave of crushing disappointment. It was almost laughable.

""Throwing my weight around?"" I echoed. ""Kris, you have never, not once, defended another woman to me—not even your own mother. This is a first.""

A flicker of confusion crossed his handsome face.

""When we got married,"" I continued, my voice dangerously calm, ""we made a deal. For the sake of both our families' reputations, you wouldn't play around, and I wouldn't waste my nights in clubs. Are you really going to break that rule for her?""

His gaze turned deep and cold. He was silent for a long moment before finally dialing the number for our family driver. Then, he leaned over, unbuckled my seatbelt, and spoke in a flat, even tone.

""You're always so forceful, Anna. We're husband and wife, not just strategic partners. Outside of work, can't you be a little more like other wives? Can't you try to rely on me, to yield just a little?""

He pulled back, his decision made. ""I'll handle things with Cathy, then I'm going to spend the night at my parents' estate. I think we both need some time to cool off.""

So that was it. He was tired of me. Bored. And now he was desperate to feel his masculine power with some other woman. He used to tell me he admired my decisiveness, my sharp, take-charge attitude more than anything.

What a pathetic, high-minded excuse to pin all the blame on me.

I got out of the car without another word, watching the black Maybach disappear from sight.

I had given him a chance. He didn't take it.

I pulled out my phone and dialed my best friend.

""Nikki,"" I said, my voice steady. ""Draft the divorce papers.""

I never wanted it to come to this. Our families, the Lockwoods and the Archers, had been friends for generations. Kris and I were childhood sweethearts, though we’d lost touch for about a decade when he went abroad for his studies. We reconnected at the dinner our families arranged to discuss our engagement. He was polished and charming, handling the elders' questions with an easy grace.

In the years he was gone, I'd thrown myself into the family business, but I’d also spent my fair share of nights at high-end clubs, decompressing with male models. I thought things would be awkward between us after so long, but when we were alone, I discovered a witty, humorous soul hidden beneath his composed exterior. That old, familiar feeling from our youth came rushing back.

We were both ambitious, at the peak of our careers. We admired each other, and soon, we were engaged and married. Our union was more than a marriage; it was a merger. Lockwood Industries and Archer Enterprises became intertwined, our stocks mutually held. Divorcing him would be a financial nightmare.

Back at home, I showered, drank a glass of warm milk, and prepared for bed. My phone buzzed with a message from Kris. Goodnight, it read, followed by a kissing emoji. Even in the midst of a cold war, he never failed to perform the perfunctory duties of a husband.

The next morning, as I was walking into my office building, a young man with bleached-blond hair nearly knocked me over. My Hermès Himalaya bag slammed onto the pavement, scuffing the exotic leather. The coffee and breakfast he was carrying flew through the air, splashing all over the hem of my cashmere coat.

The two security guards at the door saw what happened and rushed over, scolding the kid for not watching where he was going. Panicked, he scrambled to pick up my bag and tried to wipe the coffee stains off my coat with a napkin. When he saw it was hopeless, he dropped to his knees, begging me to forgive him.

It was the dead of winter, and he was only wearing a thin jacket and sunglasses, which didn't quite hide the dark bruises under his eyes.

I ignored the ruined coat, my heart aching as I frowned and gently wiped at the scuffed leather on my purse.

And of course, Kris, who always arrived at work at the same time I did, saw the whole thing from across the street. Lockwood Industries was just opposite Archer Enterprises. He stood there, watching silently, his face a mask of stern disapproval.

For the first time, I saw disgust in his eyes.

He probably thought I was on another power trip, enjoying this poor kid groveling at my feet.

I ignored his silent judgment. I took a step back, waved off the approaching guards, and pulled the young man to his feet. ""I don't know what you're going through,"" I said, my voice firm but not unkind, ""but a man's dignity is precious. You can lose anything, but you can't lose your spine. That's the only thing that truly belongs to you.""

He mumbled a stream of apologies and thank yous as he cleaned up the mess on the ground, then scurried away. Just as he rounded the corner of the building, he shot a quick look back over his shoulder, a strange, unreadable smile on his face.

Back in my office, I sat at my desk and examined the damaged bag. The scuff wasn't large; you wouldn't even notice it if you weren't looking for it. But once a flaw appears, it can never be perfect again. It was so valuable that even this tiny imperfection would be nearly impossible to repair.

Harder to fix than my bag was my marriage to Kris. The look in his eyes that morning was a thorn lodged deep in my heart.

Our lunch was a long-standing ritual. The Lockwood family chef would prepare it and have it delivered to my office, and Kris would come over to eat with me. Today, I waited until one o'clock, assuming he wasn't coming.

Just as I opened the container, he walked in.

Cathy trailed behind him. Her eyes were red and swollen, and she kept her head bowed, looking meek and fragile.

I put down my chopsticks and simply watched them.

Kris sat down beside me and sighed. ""Because of last night, Cathy is being targeted and ostracized at the office.""

I picked up my spoon and began to ladle some soup into my bowl, not even bothering to look up. ""Is that so? She's the President's executive assistant. Can't she handle a little office drama?""

His voice grew tight. ""What I mean is, I want you to call your people off. Stop tormenting a young girl!""

It was an unspoken rule of our corporate marriage: we each had our own loyalists planted in the other's company. He was accusing my people of defending my honor by going after Cathy. Last night's gala was a joint event; nearly every employee from both companies had been there. It was inevitable that Cathy's behavior would become a topic of gossip.

I stirred my soup and took a sip. ""First,"" I said calmly, ""I haven't instructed anyone to target your assistant. You should know that's not my style. Second, whatever she's facing today is a direct result of her own lack of boundaries. Kris, you still don't understand people. Your special treatment, your tolerance for her behavior—you're the one making her a target. You are the one who will ruin her, not me.""

Cathy, who had been standing silently, suddenly took two steps forward. ""It has nothing to do with Mr. Lockwood,"" she blurted out. ""Mrs. Lockwood, I know what happened yesterday was my fault. It was the first time I'd ever received such an extravagant gift, and I got carried away. I offended you, and I sincerely apologize.""

I paused, then laughed. ""Kris, your assistant is fascinating. She doesn't seem to understand plain English, but she's certainly quick to defend you.""

I didn't accept her half-hearted apology, nor did I intervene to stop the office gossip.

Cathy's tears and victimhood finally snapped something in Kris. For the first time in our relationship, he lost control. He slammed his soup bowl onto the floor at my feet, the porcelain shattering.

He demanded that I apologize to Cathy.

I had done nothing wrong. Why should I apologize?

That day, we parted on the worst terms imaginable. That very afternoon, Kris left on a business trip, taking Cathy with him, away from the toxic environment he had created.

That night, I was drinking with Nicole. She complained that I was too sharp, too intimidatingly competent. That's why a ""dumb beauty"" like Cathy had managed to catch Kris's eye.

My mother died when I was young, and my father never remarried. I was raised to be the heir, groomed from childhood to carry the weight of the entire Archer family on my shoulders. Feminine softness was a luxury I couldn't afford; it was a weakness that would only hold me back. I could stick to my principles for thirty years without wavering. Why couldn't he?

In the end, it was simple. He just didn't love me anymore. And I have no interest in things that don't belong to me.

""I actually went to Lockwood Industries today to get a look at this famous assistant,"" Nicole said, swirling the ice in her drink. ""And wow. At first glance, she's practically a knock-off Annabelle doll. Especially her eyes and those dimples—they're just like yours. I don't get what's going through Kris's head. Why ignore the real thing to coddle an imitation? Does he love you, or does he not?""

Her words cut through the alcoholic haze, sobering me instantly. No wonder I'd felt a strange, foggy sense of familiarity when I first saw Cathy.

I let out a bitter laugh. ""Who knows? Maybe the knock-off is gentler. More understanding.""

My head was pounding. Nicole drove me home, her driving exceptionally smooth because she knew I was feeling sick.

""The divorce papers are ready,"" she said as she pulled up to my villa. ""When are you going to give them to him?""

""Mid-month,"" I said. ""He'll definitely be back for the family dinner with his grandfather.""

Every month, without fail, we would go to the Lockwood family estate for dinner with his grandparents. Divorcing Kris was no small matter. I needed this time to secure my position and prepare for every possible outcome.

Cathy, meanwhile, wasn't staying quiet. Her social media was a constant stream of updates. Breakfast with the handsome CEO. Working late into the night together. Standing atop the city's tallest skyscraper, looking down on the world. Her first time skydiving, her first time seeing a real coral reef, her first time witnessing the ethereal beauty of the Northern Lights.

This business trip was giving her a lifetime of experiences she could never have dreamed of, and her feed could barely contain her joy.

I used to be the only one who did those things with Kris. Now, the looks my colleagues gave me were a mixture of pity and caution.

Kris was allowing her to use this to humiliate me. It was a flawlessly cruel, soul-crushing move.

For the next few days, Nicole practically lived with me, helping my legal team sort through the financial entanglement of my marriage.

One afternoon, she stormed into my office, her face a mask of fury, clutching a manila envelope. ""Anna, that bastard Kris has gone too far!""

I was signing a contract and looked up, startled by her rage. ""What is it? Is he back?""

Nicole slapped the envelope down on my desk. A memory card and several photos slid out, showing Kris and Cathy in a hotel suite. Kris was shirtless, and the angry red marks on his chest were a glaring accusation.

""He's not back,"" she seethed, ""but his sex tape is!""

My shoulders, which I always held so straight, slumped. My heart felt like it was being squeezed in a vise, each beat a throb of pain. With a trembling hand, I picked up the memory card and inserted it into my laptop.

The video showed a rooftop terrace at dusk. Kris was holding Cathy's face in his hands, gazing at her with an almost obsessive look. Behind them, the sky was a fiery orange, the sunset weaving a tapestry of color behind them, lovers embracing against the sky like a scene from a romantic painting.

Just as their lips were about to meet, I snapped the laptop shut.

My voice trembled uncontrollably. ""Who sent this?""

""It was couriered. The front desk signed for it.""

I took a deep, shuddering breath and slowly let it out. Methodically, I gathered the photos and put them back in the envelope, tucking them away in a desk drawer before I could regain my composure. ""Don't say a word about this to anyone. Find out who sent it.""

""Who else could it be?"" Nicole spat. ""That shameless homewrecker is desperate to climb the ladder!""

The angle of the video looked like it was secretly filmed, not staged. But it didn't matter. What mattered was that Kris, my husband, was now truly tainted.

Tomorrow was the middle of the month. It was time for all this rot to end.

The next day, Kris returned to the office. The first thing he did was hold a company-wide meeting where he made an example of three employees, firing them on the spot. They were the ones who had been most vocal in mocking Cathy. Two of them were my people.

I wasn't surprised that he would defend her so brazenly. After all, they were sleeping in the same bed now.

What did surprise me was that he brought her to the family dinner that evening. Cathy had brought a pile of expensive health supplements and gifts for my mother-in-law, clearly having done her homework. She charmed her completely, and Kris's mother was beaming.

When I arrived, my mother-in-law sent someone to fetch my father-in-law and Kris from the study, telling them it was time for dinner. She took my hand and began chattering away about trivial things.

Kris entered the dining room, glanced at me once, and then looked away. Cathy followed close behind him and, without a moment's hesitation, sat down in the chair next to him—the seat that had always been mine.

Kris froze for a second, but said nothing.

We weren't divorced yet. We were still legally husband and wife. Yet here he was, with his assistant by his side, bringing her home to the family estate, letting her occupy the seat that had always been mine.",1,1764695164.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

This tree has no money value,” Summer Moore wrote to us today after the community decorated tree went missing over the Thanksgiving weekend.

She sent us photos of community members decorating it on the evening of November 29th in the parking lot of the Get Roasted Mobile Coffee at 9251 Lemmon Drive.  

“People came out to light this tree so bright the angels above... Swinging from the stars ... Looking down ... Clapping their hands... Singing in glee ... Blowing angel kisses ... Could see our love,” she wrote indicating it was started in the memory of Izabella Loving,  whose death in April has now been ruled a homicide, with both her parents still in jail now facing a scheduled February court hearing.

“Along the way we learned of many angels; in the valley ; leaving us violently or still missing. We had no idea there were so many. 

Some families of these angels no longer live here but heard about the tree and mailed us mementos. Some wanted to stay private, others came out to put personal items of their loved ones on the tree…. socks, a pacifier, a mini rocking horse, a Santa star, baby’s first and second xmas bulbs with names of many beautiful angel souls,” Moore added. 

She said it took two men to carry the tree, and that everything was glued to it. 

“Our village came together. We lit the tree up.  The next morning a volunteer; going to secure the tree;  even better; discovered the whole tree was gone (with photo of what was left in upper left of our collage). The WHOLE tree. This is shameful. Human beings don't do this. We don't care who you are. Whatever reasons you had. Stay anonymous. Do the right thing, decent thing, the only thing. Tell us where the tree is. It’s not about the tree. It’s about what’s on the tree. It had to take more than one person. We are asking all of you to reach inside your heart. You have a chance to be a real hero. We know you can do this.  Tell us where the tree is,” Moore concluded in her message, saying a police report has already been filed.

Although I decided to go with injection (ordered through Brello) I still started taking the sublingual Tirzepatide from Fridays. I got it for $98 + tax during their Black Friday sale. Still overpriced for snake oil, I know, but I still wanted to try since I already fell for it. My BMI is 23-24 and I’m trying to lose the 12-15 max lbs perimenopausal weight I gained over the last 2 years and I have been very frustrated because I worked hard on healthy life style eating healthy, clean intermittent fasting very low on carbs and sugar and regularly exercising in those two years dealing with weight gain. Nothing seemed to work and the visceral fat around my belly is at a very concerning level for the size of my body. Never had anything like this is my life before.

So- it’s my 4th day on the oral Tirze. And I think it is doing something. Placebo? Maybe. But still welcomed.

I place the tab under the tongue slowly and do not swallow the saliva too fast. I let it sit in my mouth contacting my cheeks from inside as long as possible. The tab isn’t small, it takes one full hour to completely dissolve. 

Since 1st day of 1.25mg Tirze(everyday one tablet of 1.25mg),

1. Intermittent fasting has been effortless. My first meal is past 1pm(dinner is always before 6). Around 10am I feel very mildly hungry but never a strong hunger pang.

2. No snacks interest me and I don’t feel like opening the pantry unless I’m cooking for the family. I have sweet tooth but I have not wanted sweets. My gut says nope. No coffee cravings even in the morning. That’s pretty cool.

3. I eat normal amount of food, and digest just find. But between meals I don’t need to eat out of boredom. This is very interesting.

4. Food tastes boring. Still good but not too exciting. Hmm.

I hope this is okay to post here, mods. I didn't know where else to post this so here goes.

I've lived in Boston for 6 years -- West Coast native -- and while I enjoy many things about our city, I've had a really hard time making friends. I have a couple really good friends here, but I don't see them as often as I'd like (maybe once a month if I'm lucky) and many people I hang out with more regularly are people I share a common activity with, and while that can be great fun and I truly enjoy their company, I'm missing a deeper connection.

One of the issues I think is I have different interests than a lot of people I've met so far. I'm (sadly!) not into gaming, and I live for cold weather and snow. When the temperatures drop, I go out!

I come from an aviation and maritime background and really gelled with a lot of people there, particularly because we went through some really intense training together and shared similar dreams. But since I got out of those industries, I feel lost.

I'm an extrovert who does social events and Meetups several times a month, and I do have fun, but I don't make lasting connections through these groups. There are often interesting people and good conversations, but I never hear from the people again, even if they live close by.

I'm hoping to find a small group of people I can hang out with fairly regularly who share my interests and want to get out and see random places in Boston. I like boats and planes and love foreign languages, and enjoy hanging at coffee shops, going on really long walks/beginner-level hikes, cooking for people, and traveling around the city discovering different spots. I enjoy intellectual conversations about random stuff from binomial theorem to why places like Transnistria have plastic currency (yes, I'm a nerd in a hoodie). And I will happily play in the snow almost any day!

I'm also really passionate about Russian language and culture (please don't read anything into this) and need an outlet for this interest. Ideally I'd like to meet people I can talk my broken Russian to and talk about Russian geopolitics ad nauseum, but I realize if I find that, it would be an added bonus. I could literally eat borsch every day, but my two attempts at cooking it were a disaster! Currently I live in Brighton though, so who knows?

If anyone is interested in chatting, please DM me. Please note I am not looking to date; I'm looking to build a new friends group. Also, if you have any ideas on where I could meet more like-minded people, I'd also really appreciate it.

I hope to hear from you soon! Thanks so much for reading my insanely long post and hope you have a good day.",10,1764694878.0,BostonSocialClub,8,0.92,False

1+year clean and boredom is still my biggest trigger, not stress not bad days just having nothing to do. My brain doesnt know how to be still without wanting some kind of action

So instead of opening a betting app i opened this recovery [tool](https://nogambling.app) i use that has a journal.

How my brain was trying to trick me and how i knew one bet would turn into a full relapse by launch

Something about putting it on the screen made it feel smaller like this loud voice in my head but when i wrote it out it looked kinda pathetic honestly

20 min later i was at the gym and urge was gone  
Not saying this works every time but it worked today and today is all i got

Every morning, I wake up at 5 a.m., gently kiss my sleeping wife, and head downstairs to make coffee. Sometimes, I find myself getting misty-eyed with gratitude, overwhelmed by how deeply happy I am to be married.

Before you assume my life has been easy, know that I have been widowed, suffered a heart attack, lost a job, and raised my children as a single parent. My wife and I have chronic diseases managed with meds and good doctors. Still, through all of life’s twists and turns, I have always believed in the power and beauty of marriage.

To that end, besides the obvious benefits - combining finances, economies of scale with real estate, cars, and expenses - the greatest payoff is having a soulmate. Lest you think she is my everything, she isn’t. No single person can fulfill all of your needs.

That’s why I have my guy friends for sports, ROMEO (Retired Old Men Eating Out) lunches, and other activities. My wife has her network of girlfriends, too. 

Perhaps, the greatest gift of marriage is vulnerability, creativity, and having someone to love. That you can be yourself, no hiding your shadow self, and share your fears, sadness, and highs without being judged. We offer constructive criticism to each other, too.

We do silly stuff, too. About twice a year, we “knock boots” when the sun shines, then go out for happy hour. Dinner dates with our couples' friends keep things fresh and interesting.

What about your marriage makes you happy?

1pcdojh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1pcdojh/the_birthday_gift_from_my_boyfriend_that_ill/,The Birthday Gift From My Boyfriend That I’ll Never Forget.,"Last year, my birthday was just another day-or so I thought. I didn't expect much, for work had been stressful, life was busy, and honestly, I convinced myself it would be a quiet day with perhaps a light dinner or a call from family.

My boyfriend, Alex, had been a bit secretive for the past week. He would smile in such a way that would make me raise an eyebrow, but I had shrugged it off, thinking that he was teasing me. The morning of my birthday, I woke up to find a small note upon my bedside table. It was in his handwriting-neat and careful-the message stating simply.

Don’t check your phone for the next hour. Come downstairs instead. Curious and a bit baffled, I dressed and descended the stairs. In the living room, fairy lights lined the walls, with soft music playing; there, in the middle of the room, lay a small box wrapped in brown paper with string around it. I froze.

When I opened it, my heart skipped a beat. Inside was a handmade scrapbook  completely personalized. Each page had pictures of us together, little notes, tickets from movies we’d seen, dried flowers from walks we’d taken, and tiny sketches he had made. Some pages even had small envelopes with handwritten messages tucked inside.

I'll never forget the day you made coffee for me in the morning and burnt it, but smiled nonetheless. You laughed so hard at the dog outside our window last week it's moments like that I love.

You make rainy days feel sunny, just by being you. It wasn't expensive. It wasn't a gadget or jewelry. But it was the most thoughtful gift I've ever received. He had spent weeks putting it together, remembering the tiniest details about our time together, all to make me feel special.

I flipped through its pages for the next hour, laughing and crying at the same time. Alex sat beside me quietly, holding my hand, smiling every time I reacted to a page. And when I clung tightly to him, he whispered, I wanted you to feel loved all day, not just for a moment. Every page is a little memory of us.

That birthday, something struck me: that not all great gifts have to be very expensive or flashy; they just have to be real, personal, and made with love. Even now, months later, when I'm having a bad day, I often pull out the scrapbook. It doesn't just remind me of my birthday it reminds me that love can be felt in the smallest, most thoughtful gestures.",12,1764694544.0,Gifts,11,0.8,False

* “What if it’s actually bad?”
* “What if I missed something obvious?”
* “I poured so much into this, why do I feel empty now?”
* “Do other creators go through this part?”

I’m trying to figure out if this is normal for TTRPG writers/designers, or if this is just a creative crash after pouring everything into a project.

For those of you who’ve written, laid out, and added real art to campaigns:

* Do you get this emotional whiplash at the end?
* How do you handle the “post-creation crash”?
* Does it get easier with experience?

Would love to hear other people’s experiences . This community understands the process better than anyone.",0,1764693993.0,rpg,2,0.5,False

Or accepting too little?","TL;DR; I feel like I'm being breadcrumbed, but not in the same way I'm been breadcrumbed in the past (ie, you'll do until something better comes along) but I'm also afraid I'm just too attached too quick.

 I, F42, have been dating R, M49, about 7 months. We've known each other as acquaintances through work for years (different companies, but our jobs cross paths) we have both been out of the dating game for years. I'm a single mom, I made a conscious decision to focus solely on my kids for the time being about 7 years ago. He had a bad breakup about 9 years ago and decided not to date. Some time last year, I developed a bit of a crush on him, but had no intention on acting on it. I confided in a friend/coworker about it, looking for advice on how to shake the crush. She, instead, decided to play match maker. She told him someone was interested in him, if he was open. He said he absolutely wasn't. A few days later, he came back to her and said he was curious. When she told him it was me, he completely changed his mind. He told her (and later me) that he had absolutely no idea I was interested in him, and had she said any other name, he would have stuck with no, but he was really interested in me. Once my friend confessed to me she told him, I kinda felt like I had to ask him out. We took things really slow, but I was twitterpated from the first date. The thing is, he's quiet and I'm chatty. He was the first one to say I love you, and he brings me flowers and tells me I'm beautiful. He's told me he thinks I'm the best thing to happen to him. But I also feel like he's keeping me at arms length. I've opened up about all kinds of things about past relationships and childhood trauma, but he's opened up about nothing, then I always feel like I've shared too much. Our conversations are mostly surface level because I now feel self conscious, like, Ive shared too much. We only dated when my kids were at their dads in the beginning, and by dated, I mean, he comes to my place and hangs out, we usually watch tv. He didnt even spend the night until about 2 months in (we were both pretty nervous to rush physical as it had been so long for both of us). About 5 months in, I asked how he felt about meeting my kids (9 and 11) he said he was nervous but excited. I then told my kids I was seeing someone, and we spent an afternoon together. Since then, he's been around the kids on occasion, but only when ive invited him to specific things, like halloween or thanksgiving. we still usually only see each other when they're at their dads. He says all the right things, but he's hot and cold. It feels fake, like he's just giving me what he thinks he's supposed to say. Some mornings I get ""good morning beautiful"" texts a week in a row, and we'll be texting back and forth all day, then it'll change and I wont hear from him until I text him and I'll only get one word responses, like ill ask  ""how was your day?"", ""good"". We basically have a standing date when the kids go to their dads, but I have no idea what time he's showing up. The kids go at 430. He'll show up here any time between 5-9, and I never know ahead of time when, so I'm just sitting here, waiting. I feel like he's not interested, but when I get up the nerve to ask him whats otg, have i done something? he tells me he didn't realize I felt that way, he loves me, that he wants me to feel loved and safe and supported with him. I then feel like Im imagining things, Im crazy, im paranoid. But then back to barely hearing from him. For weeks on end, he'll surprise me with a coffee on my days off (his job has him passing my place, and his job always time to stop) but then that ends. I'll sometimes text him, like, I miss him or I'm thinking about him, and he'll say like ""me too"", or ""i cant wait to see you friday"" but I've never gotten a text from him saying that, so I've stopped that now. I've met his adult child once, and his parents 3 times, but he's very close with all of them.
He's a good, stand up guy. He's not a woman chaser or a player. I'm the one who initiates sex, which is getting harder to do because im losing my self confidence. If we actually do anything besides watch TV at my house, it's because I ask to, but he also never says no, and never complains. I feel like I'm always walking on egg shells, because when he gets cold I feel like I said or did something wrong, but if I ask him if anythings wrong, he acts surprised, and tells me he loves me and I'm perfect.
I'm feeling so self conscious in this relationship, and Ive always been such a confident person. I'm feeling like I'm annoying him or bothering him when I message. I'm feeling like I'm talking too much. I'm also afraid I've put too much of myself into a relationship that's still short yet, because I broke my own rule by dating in the first place.",3,1764693822.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

📱 **iOS App Store:**  
[https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600)

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

1pcd873,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcd873,The Husband From Tomorrow – Part 1,"The screen opens on a quiet morning. The heroine sits by the window, brush in hand, eyes focused, lips slightly curved in a faint smile. Sunlight dances on her hair, and her movements are calm, yet filled with purpose. She is an artist at heart, her world a mix of colors, sketches, and half-finished canvases leaning against the walls. Her dream is simple: to have her art displayed in a museum, where strangers would pause and feel the emotions she pours into every stroke.

Her life is quiet, peaceful, with only her close friend from the coffee shop to bring occasional laughter and encouragement. But today, her routine will change forever

That night, after a long day of painting, she falls asleep—and wakes up to the impossible.

A stranger lies beside her.

“Who… who are you?!” she gasps, leaping back. “Why are you in my bed?!”

The young man opens his eyes calmly. “I am your husband,” he says softly. “You don’t know me yet… but I know you very well.”

Confusion, fear, and disbelief crash into her all at once. She pushes him out and slams the door behind him. This has to be a nightmare, she thinks, her heart still racing.

The next morning, she gets ready to meet her boyfriend—someone she likes, but not enough to give up her art. He has no interest in her passion, and marriage to him would mean leaving her dreams behind. She hopes the meeting will be ordinary, but her plans are shattered before they even begin.

Outside, the stranger is waiting silently.

“Why are you here again?!” she shouts.

“I am your husband,” he replies gently. “Where else would I go? I will stay with you.”

She ignores him and hurries toward her boyfriend. He follows silently, trailing behind her, calm but unwavering. She walks faster, her heartbeat quickening, and he keeps pace, always behind her, never leaving.

“Don’t go so fast,” he warns softly.

She doesn’t listen. Her mind is tangled with anger, confusion, and fear. She pushes herself to move even faster.

Suddenly, a woman carrying a tray of tomatoes—her mother—appears in her path. The tray wobbles dangerously. She tries to dodge, but she’s moving too quickly. Tomatoes tumble everywhere, rolling across the street, splattering around her.

For a moment, panic seizes her. She nearly swings into a tray of wood set aside nearby, and in that instant, a strange thought flashes through her mind: How does he know everything? Could he really be from the future?

Her heart races. She pushes forward, faster than before, until finally, breathless and flustered, she reaches the café. Safe—for now.

Her boyfriend notices her unusual behavior immediately. “Why do you look so nervous? Why are you acting differently?” he asks. Then he speaks of serious matters—marriage, asking her to leave her art behind, to commit fully to him. She cannot answer; fear and disbelief leave her frozen.

Before she can respond, the hero slides into the seat beside her. Her boyfriend’s face turns red with anger.

“Who is he?” he demands.

“I am her husband,” the hero says calmly. “I have the right to sit beside her.”

The heroine tries to push him away. “Go sit somewhere else! I’ll pay for your food! Just go!”

The hero smiles softly. “See? She is my wife. That is why she pays for me.”

Her boyfriend storms out, furious. She wants to follow him, but the hero’s quiet warning stops her. “Don’t go so fast… something will happen.”

She ignores him, rushing forward, nearly tripping over a spilled tray of food. That strange thought from before lingers in her mind, leaving her with a mix of fear and curiosity about the impossible young man.

After the café, she returns home, still flustered and frustrated. She paces inside, trying to calm herself, her thoughts racing. Anger bubbles up—how dare this stranger claim to be her husband? But no matter how hard she tries to ignore him, he has not disappeared.

Hours later, she notices him standing outside her house, patiently waiting. Her heart skips, then hardens. “You are coming back to me? Go! Just go!” she shouts.

“I am your husband,” he says calmly. “Where would I go? I will stay right here.”

The heroine slams the door and retreats to her room, trying to focus on her art. She dips her brush in paint, but her mind keeps drifting to him. Hours pass. Night falls, and snow begins to gently blanket the street. She looks out the window and sees him still waiting, shivering in the cold.

A sudden warmth wells up inside her. Quietly, she goes outside and begins to sing softly for him, her voice carrying through the snow-laden air. He looks up, listening patiently, and she feels a strange calm as she sings. Bit by bit, she coaxed him closer, until finally, she opens the door and allows him inside.

The next morning, her client arrives. The painting she had intended to present—a delicate floral piece—was her favorite, and she expected it to be chosen. But the hero, knowing her from the future, leans in quietly. “Don’t choose that one. Take this one instead.”

The heroine freezes. “Don’t open the door! That was my secret!” she whispers.

“I know,” he says gently. “Painting 1096. Take it. The client will love it.”

Her heart races. Only she had known the painting’s number, and now he had predicted her secret. She is stunned, unable to hide her shock. The next day, she follows his advice. The client’s eyes light up the moment he sees the painting. “This is incredible!” he exclaims.

One weekend later, the museum opens its doors, showcasing her work to the public. She feels deep happiness and pride, but also a quiet corner of her heart reserved for the hero—the mysterious man who seems to know her completely.

And one day she called him to meet at a café again. She needed answers, but her heart was still full of doubt. When he arrived, he ordered a coffee for himself and a hot chocolate for her. She stared at him in surprise—she had never told anyone she liked hot chocolate.

He smiled softly. “Ask me anything about yourself. Anything. I will answer.”

The heroine took a deep breath, feeling her heart pound. “I want to believe you,” she said. “But how do I know you’re really my husband… from the future?”

And so, she began asking him personal questions…


And that is where Part 1 ends.

The desire for fuller, more defined lips has made lip augmentation one of the most popular aesthetic procedures globally. If you are considering enhancing your smile, you are joining over 3.4 million Americans who sought dermal fillers in Dallas in 2025, making it the second most requested non-surgical cosmetic treatment in the country.

Choosing the right product and provider is key to achieving a beautiful, natural result. The gold standard for this treatment, particularly [Lip filler in Dallas, TX](https://www.dluxemed.com/post/juvederm-lip-augmentation-dallas-tx), is the specialized family of hyaluronic acid Juvederm in Dallas, TX products.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process, the science, and the precise care needed to make your lip enhancement in Dallas journey a success.

# Understanding the Role of Hyaluronic Acid

At its core, **Juvederm in Dallas, TX** is a dermal filler composed of synthetic [hyaluronic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482440/) (HA), a naturally occurring substance found in your skin, joints, and eyes. Its primary function is to attract and hold moisture, acting like a molecular sponge.

When injected into the lips, HA immediately draws in water, providing instantaneous volume and structure. This biocompatibility is why HA fillers are preferred globally: they integrate seamlessly with your natural tissue, offering an aesthetically pleasing and safe path to your desired look when seeking a **Lip filler in Dallas, TX**.

# Choosing the Right Juvederm Formulation

The Juvederm brand offers a range of formulas, each designed for a specific level of volume and longevity, allowing for tailored results in your **lip enhancement in Dallas**. The most common choices for the lips are Juvederm Ultra XC and Juvederm Volbella XC.

Ultra XC is often used for clients desiring a more noticeable increase in fullness, while Volbella XC provides subtle enhancement and is often used to smooth fine lines around the mouth. Your expert injector will assess your natural anatomy and aesthetic goals to determine the ideal product and technique for your customized **Lip filler in Dallas, TX** treatment.

# The Art of a Natural-Looking Augmentation

The best [Juvederm lip injections](https://www.juvederm.com/treatment-areas/lip-filler) **in Dallas, TX** are those that are noticed for their beautiful result, not for being ""done."" Achieving this level of artistry requires not just medical skill, but a deep understanding of facial anatomy and aesthetic proportions.

Your injector will focus on maintaining the natural balance between your upper and lower lips, ensuring the outcome is harmonious with your overall facial structure. This meticulous approach guarantees a sophisticated, natural-looking volume that complements your features, confirming the importance of choosing an experienced provider for your **Lip filler in Dallas, TX**.

# Pre-Treatment Preparation and Safety Protocols

Preparing correctly for your Lip filler appointment is essential to minimize bruising and ensure a smooth recovery. You should avoid blood-thinning medications and supplements, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and high-dose Vitamin E, for approximately one week prior to your session.

This simple preparatory step significantly reduces the likelihood of bruising at the injection sites. On the day of the procedure, a topical numbing cream will be applied, ensuring your experience is as comfortable as possible before the expert begins your **Juvederm lip injections in Dallas, TX**.

# Post-Procedure Care: Maximizing Longevity

Proper aftercare is non-negotiable for protecting your investment and ensuring the filler settles correctly, leading to maximum longevity. Swelling and minor bruising are common, but these symptoms typically resolve within two to three days.

During the initial 24 hours, you must avoid intense heat, strenuous exercise, and alcohol, as these activities can increase swelling and disrupt the filler’s integration. It is recommended to gently apply a clean, cool compress to the area in short 10-minute intervals to manage any immediate swelling after receiving your **Lip filler in Dallas, TX**.

# Predicting Results: How long does Juvederm Volbella last?

One of the most frequent questions clients ask is about the duration of their results. The longevity of your [non-surgical lip enhancement](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a44823443/needle-free-lip-filler-alternatives/) depends heavily on the specific product used and your individual metabolic rate.

Juvederm Volbella XC, commonly used for subtle volume, often lasts up to twelve months in many patients. However, active lifestyle factors and high metabolism can sometimes necessitate a touch-up closer to six or nine months to maintain that initial flawless result from your Lip filler.

# Evaluating the risks and benefits of hyaluronic acid lip filler

Like any medical procedure, seeking **Juvederm lip injections in Dallas, TX** carries both advantages and minimal risks, which should be thoroughly discussed during your consultation. The primary benefit is the immediate, reversible, and natural-looking volume achieved through a minimally invasive process.

The risks are typically minor and temporary, including bruising, swelling, or tenderness at the injection site. Importantly, because HA is fully dissolvable with an enzyme (hyaluronidase), the treatment is reversible, offering significant safety and peace of mind when choosing a **Lip filler in Dallas, TX**.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1. How painful are Juvederm lip injections?** Discomfort is typically minimal. A topical numbing cream is applied before injection, and Juvederm formulations often contain lidocaine for enhanced comfort during the procedure.

**2. How long before I see the final, settled results?** While volume is immediate, the final, natural-looking results are generally visible about two weeks after treatment, once all swelling has fully subsided.

**3. Is it true that lip filler can be reversed?** Yes, a major advantage of Juvederm is that the hyaluronic acid can be instantly and safely dissolved using an enzyme called hyaluronidase if needed.

**4. How much time should I take off work for a Lip filler treatment?** None is required. You can return to work immediately, though you might experience mild, noticeable swelling for the rest of the day.

**5. How long does the procedure itself take?** The injection process is usually quite fast, often taking only 15 to 30 minutes, not including the initial consultation and numbing time.

**6. Can I drink coffee or alcohol immediately after getting Juvederm in Dallas, TX?** It is best to avoid alcohol for 24 hours. You can drink coffee, but try to avoid hot beverages right after the treatment to minimize inflammation.

**7. How much does Lip filler typically cost?** The cost varies based on the amount of product used and the injector's expertise, but generally ranges between $500 and $1,200 per syringe.

**8. When can I return to my normal skincare routine?** Avoid harsh active ingredients like retinoids and chemical exfoliants for at least 48 to 72 hours, sticking to gentle cleansers and moisturizers.

**9. Will I need follow-up appointments?** Yes, most patients return for a maintenance or touch-up treatment every 6 to 12 months to retain their preferred volume and shape.

**10. What is the difference between Juvederm Ultra and Volbella?** Ultra is a thicker formulation used for maximum volume, while Volbella is softer and primarily used for subtle definition, contouring, and fine lines.

# Your Path to Balanced, Beautiful Lips

Choosing to enhance your lips is an exciting, personal decision that promises to elevate your confidence and smile. By selecting hyaluronic acid-based fillers like Juvederm, you are choosing a treatment backed by extensive scientific research and a proven safety record.

However, the quality of your results hinges not just on the product, but on the skill and artistry of your injector. For unparalleled expertise, beautiful, natural results, and personalized care, D'LUXE Aesthetics is the [Best Medspa in Dallas, TX](https://www.dluxemed.com/).

Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

[Safe or Not](https://www.safeornot.space/community)

You can search for 'Bangkok' or 'Vietnam' for example

It started simple. I just wanted a nice screen to look at when I hit F11. A few links, maybe a clock.

Fast forward three months, and I have completely lost control of my life.

I present **Compass**. It was supposed to be a startpage. It is now a zero-dependency, offline-first operating system that lives in my browser. I wrote every single library from scratch because I apparently have trust issues with `npm`.

Here is a list of things I added instead of going to sleep:

**1. The ""Why is there a Physics Engine?"" Music Player (**`EosPhyMusic.js`**)** I couldn't just play MP3s. No, that would be too easy. I wrote a physics simulation for audio. It has ""Neuro-Gating"" and a ""Cochlear Shield."" I don't even know if those are real words, but the code says they reduce fatigue in the 3.5kHz range, so I guess I'm a scientist now. It generates binaural beats (Alpha/Gamma) using a custom `AudioWorklet` because I needed my startpage to hack my brainwaves.

**2. I put a Dungeon Crawler inside the dashboard (**`Eospiral.js`**)** I got bored of clicking bookmarks, so I wrote a full procedural RPG.

* It has a loot system.
* It has turn-based combat.
* It has ASCII bosses.
* It runs natively in the dashboard.
* *Why?* I don't know. But I can grind XP while checking my emails.

**3. The ""Sentient"" UI (**`eosadaptiveui.js`**)** The UI extracts dominant colors from my wallpaper using K-Means clustering (running on a hidden canvas) and themes the entire application in real-time. The cursor tracks elements like it’s alive. It’s honestly a little creeping me out.

**4. The ""Paranoid"" Storage System (**`eostorage.js`**)** I called it ""The Monolith Edition"" in the comments. It’s a custom wrapper for IndexedDB that handles AES-GCM encryption and GZIP compression. Because clearly, my list of bookmarks needs military-grade security.

**5. The ""Productivity"" Suite (that I use to procrastinate)**

* **EosPad:** A document editor that I built from scratch. It supports Markdown, rich text, and has a ""Distraction-Free"" mode (which I use to stare at a blank screen).
* **EosScholar:** An AI study partner that times my Pomodoro sessions and plays pink noise.
* **EosOrbit:** A media discovery engine that searches the Internet Archive and LibriVox. It has a ""Zero Gravity"" mode where search results float around. I added physics to a search bar. I need a hobby.

**The Tech Stack:**

* **Frameworks:** None. Zero.
* **Libraries:** I wrote them all. (`eosearch.js`, `eoswave.js`, `eosprevent.js`... the list goes on).
* **Sanity:** Depleted.

It works entirely offline (except for the AI chat/web search). It’s responsive. It’s excessive. It’s my baby.

Since the time for new years resolution is coming

I shall share what is did to diet down recently

Total Time taken is about 8 months give or take. Started at sept 2024 until Dec 2024, Took a diet break between Jan to June to focus on my career and stuffs . Gained about 10lb during that break. Then continue dieting down until last month 22nd for my wedding.

90% of the work is your mindset , not gonna lie the diet and training is the easy part but the mindset you need to have is the challenge.

The mindset I practice is called

**"" Pull back and accumulate""**

The concept is pretty simple . Do things slowly, understand what you like and don't like . Don't be afraid to test things out and if you don't think you enjoy it then go back to your "" stable"" place. Many times people fail in their diet is due to trying to take in too much and break under the new set of rules they impose on themselves without really understanding or enjoying the process

Example is if you can maintain 10k steps a day , you can try going 11k but if you think its way too hard to maintain, minimum you can go back to is 10k steps and slowly climb back to 11k steps again. This is pulling back and accumulate.

Same for diet, if you go from 2000 calories to 1800 and you find your body starts to fatigue and get hungry too often, don't be afraid to go back to 2000 calories and slowly taper down again at a later time. This is pulling back

**Heres my SECRET**

**Steps** \- main form of neat ( non - exercise activity Thermogenesis)

**Exercise** \- Started 7 days a week , dropped to 4 progressively )

**Calories** \- For me started at maintenance and slowly taper down

**Rest** \- 7-9 hours of sleep

**Electrolytes, Vitamins, Minerals, Fiber** \- overlooked source of nutrients your body needs and wants

**Time** \- changes take time, don't rush it.



**Steps**

Started at 8k - 10k steps daily

Slowly climb up to 12k-15k

If I feel too tired some days then don't increase steps for that period and sometimes drop 1k-2k steps

As I get used to it increase step count up till 20k steps

I mainly walk around the house, watching TV

Try to incorporate other activity while walking such as playing game, during work meeting, maybe practice musical instrument

Days that I am busy or tired I will do minimum 10k steps



**Exercise**

Pick what you like pickle ball, badminton, weight training , powerlifting, bodybuilding

Don't really matter what you do just make sure you enjoy it enough to do it often

I started with 7 days a week , dropped to 6 , then 5 then 4

For weight lifting , if you just want to preserve muscle, 2 hard sets a week is sufficient.

But I recommend doing what you were already doing and slowly taper the volume lower while keeping the weight and intensity the same

Beginning of my diet this my workout



**Workout A** 2x a Week ( Mon , Thurs) - not including warmup

3 Set 5-8 Reps Weighted Pull ups

3 Set 5-8 Reps Bent Over Row

3 Set 12 Reps Cable Curls Superset 20 Reps Reverse Cable Fly

**Workout B** 2x a Week ( Tues, Fri)- not including warmup

3 Sets 5-8 Reps Incline Barbell Bench Press

3 Sets 8-12 Reps Barbell Shoulder Press Superset 12-15 Reps Cable Chest Fly

3 Sets 15-20 Reps Cable Lateral Raise Superset 15-20 Reps Cable Overhead Extention

**Workout C** 2x a Week ( Wed, Sat)- not including warmup

3 Set 5-8 Reps Back Squat

2 Set 5-8 Reps Deadlift Superset with AMRAP Sissy Squat

3 Set 12 Reps Leg Extension

3 Set 12 Reps Leg Curl superset with AMRAP Leg Raise



Towards the end of my diet this my workout, if you notice its the same routine jz scaled back because on a deficit the one thing I do not compromise is intensity, I'd cut frequency and volume before intensity .

**Workout A** 2x a Week ( Mon , Thurs) - not including warmup

1 Set AMRAP Pull ups

2 Set 5-8 Reps Weighted Pull ups

2 Set 5-8 Reps Bent Over Row

2 Set 12 Reps Cable Curls Superset 20 Reps Reverse Cable Fly

**Workout B** 2x a Week ( Tues, Fri)- not including warmup

2 Sets 5-8 Reps Incline Barbell Bench Press

2 Sets 8-12 Reps Barbell Shoulder Press Superset 12-15 Reps Cable Chest Fly

2 Sets 15-20 Reps Cable Lateral Raise Superset 15-20 Reps Cable Overhead Extention

1 Set AMRAP Push ups

**Workout C** 2x a Week ( Sat)- I honestly treat this as an optional workout towards the end during the cut as I have historically been leg dominant ( did Bulgarian method when I was younger )

2 Sets 5-8 Reps Back Squat

2 Set 5-8 Reps Deadlift Superset with AMRAP Sissy Squat

2 Sets AMRAP Leg Raise

Near the end priority to train legs dropped as for my case specifically I am very leg dominant and want to emphasize more on my upper body. I needed the rest days instead.

If you started with 60kg barbell bench press in the beginning , you should either be doing 60kg with similar/slightly lower reps or increasing the weight overtime.



**Calories**

I ate at maintenance while focusing on increasing step count and being consistent with my diet, then every milestone ( 1-2kg difference ) I will either drop calories by 200-300 or increase step count by 1k.

When i hit a minimum threshold in calories ( around 1600-1800 for me ) , I would take a 2 week diet break, keep everything else the same and start back at new maintenance and taper down again.

My main diet is pretty basic but it works for me:



**Meal 1** \- I do it overnight oats style:

\-100cals Rolled oats/ muesli

\-120cals whey protein

\-30 cals powdered peanut butter

\-100cals banana / strawberry / blueberries etc

about 350 cals + 30g protein



**Meal 2** \- Usually just throw everything in a pot and just stir cook it:

\-250cals chicken breast

\-150cals frozen/canned vegetable ( carrot , peas,corn whatever )

\-50cals green veg ( cabbage , Japanese cucumber, spinach, whatever)

about 450 cals + 50g protein



**Meal 3** \- I usually do omelette but occasionally do it Malaysian style ( half boild eggs) , if I do that then cut the cheese for another egg:

\-3 eggs

\-slice of low fat cheese

\-2 slice of wholemeal bread

About 400 cals + 30g protein



**Meal 4** is the fun meal - but aim for at least 20g protein and around 400 cals:

a) Protein bar + some fruits ( watermelon ,kiwi, pineapple etc)

b) Protein cookie dough + some fruits ( watermelon ,kiwi, pineapple etc)

c) Protein smoothie / milkshake + some fruits ( watermelon ,kiwi, pineapple etc)

d) Ninja Creami ice cream

e) Try to bake some protein snacks + some fruits ( watermelon ,kiwi, pineapple etc)

f) Sometimes I cut the bread and cheese from meal 3 and do a packed of instant noodles + whey shake

**Meal 5**, \~150 cals before bed maybe a couple of cookies + a glass of milk . This is quite optional for me.

Of course this diet works for me but if you like to try it go ahead. Else find one that suits you. I like it because every meal definitely gives me a good volume and I feel quite full. and most of it is really easy to prepare.

Meal Timing for me is quite hard for those who aren't used to fasting.



Per day I drink up to 7-8 liters of water.

Morning 9am : Black Coffee

Morning 11am : Black Coffee

Noon 1pm : Maybe a Tea or Another Black Coffee / Diet coke

Evening 3pm : Caffiene Free Diet Soda / Energy Drink

Evening 6pm : Meal 1

Night 8pm : Meal 2 and 3

Night 11pm : Meal 4

Whenever : Meal 5 sometimes have it before bed, sometimes as a preworkout , sometimes if I feel too hungry before 6pm



**Rest**

I try to sleep around the same time everyday and wake up the same time everyday. Shooting for 8-9 hours but usually 7 to 8 hours. Nothing special here. Just Cut coffee 8 hours before and take a couple pills of magnesium before bed.",0,1764693302.0,loseit,3,0.33,False

Last night he went on a rant about the word of wisdom. He explained to me how in the late 1800s heat was being used in the distillation process of alcohol and heat was also being used in the process of food production. He said that Joseph Smith as a seer saw that in the last days, our time, food and drinks that go through a heating process when they are made are actually poisonous. My ex claimed that""hot drinks"" are food and drinks that are processed with use of heat. He went on to explain that all the food we currently buy from the store is poisonous and Joseph Smith saw this and that's why he passed the word of wisdom. He said it's not hot drinks It's heat processed foods. Y'all this is absolutely wild to me. What crazy YouTuber or prepper came up with this bullshit? I don't disagree that a lot of the food we eat is not great for us but I also don't believe it's poison. The absolute delusion that my ex lives in is insanity. 

He also proceeded to tell me how I listen to Satan's lies in the ex Mormon community and that Joseph Smith did not have plural wives and that the gospel topic essays are anti-Mormon nonsense that the church has allowed to stay on the website.

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

📱 **iOS App Store:**  
[https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600)

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

That’s when it hit me: I had been living on autopilot for years. Same routine, same job I didn’t care about, same feeling of being “fine” but never actually happy. I hadn’t taken a day off in months, hadn’t seen friends, and hadn’t done anything creative even though I used to love drawing.

Sitting there on the floor, next to spilled coffee, I realized my life wasn’t ruined it was just completely neglected. I was surviving, not living.

The next day, I asked my boss for a week off. I cleaned my apartment, went for long walks, reached out to people I missed, and started drawing again. It wasn’t a magical fix, but it was the first time in years I chose myself.

I’m new to the area and I’m looking for a good local coffee roaster before potentially choosing an out of state subscription service! Looking at the community for some recommendations!

It will be mostly for drip coffee, I do prefer natural coffees that are more fruit forward on a light/medium-light roast!

Your help is much appreciated!",9,1764692614.0,cincinnati,28,0.92,False

I’m posting here hoping to find a genuine, childfree connection and get to know someone naturally over time. I’m fully committed to the childfree life and ideally a future DINK lifestyle as well.

I’d describe myself as an introverted extrovert, I enjoy going out and trying new things, but I also appreciate chill nights in. I’m a big sports fan, a coffee lover, and a beginner photographer. I love checking out new food spots and keeping up with movies. I’m a Regal pass and Letterboxd user, so I’ll watch pretty much anything if it interests me. I also enjoy TV shows and some anime. I have a small dog who’s one of my best friends, and I love animals in general.

Personality wise, I’m open minded, a good listener, and always working on becoming a better version of myself. I really value emotional awareness, honesty, and personal growth.

I’m hoping to meet someone who also values communication, emotional connection, humor, and getting to know each other on a deeper level. Preferably someone in SoCal/California and around my age. I’m totally open to trading pictures once we both feel comfortable.

If this resonates with you, feel free to reach out 🙂

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Charleston Southern Buccaneers vs. UT Martin Skyhawks: A Statistical Circus with a 5.5-Point Spread**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for the most thrilling clash of college basketball since a toddler discovered the concept of “elbows.” The Charleston Southern Buccaneers (5-4) traipse into Tennessee to face the UT Martin Skyhawks (5-2), where the betting line has the Skyhawks favored by 5.5 points. Let’s unpack this like a Christmas present wrapped in riddles.

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

UT Martin, the home team, is a fortress of mediocrity. They average 76.9 points per game (203rd in D1) but allow a paltry 66.4 (59th). Their +10.5 point differential sounds impressive until you realize they’re basically the “okay, but not great” of college hoops—like a toaster that also brews coffee but still burns your toast. They dominate the rebound battle by 9.7 boards per game (38.6 RPG, 33rd nationally), which is less impressive when you realize their opponent, Charleston Southern, grabs 39.2 rebounds per game (25th). It’s a rebounders’ WWE match.

Charleston, meanwhile, is the Elon Musk of basketball: high-risk, high-reward. They average 82.8 points per game (102nd) but allow 79.7 (290th). Their +28 scoring differential is a statistical mirage fueled by their third-most three-pointers per game (12.9). However, their Achilles’ heel? Turnovers. The Buccaneers cough up the ball 13.1 times per game—enough to make a magician jealous. They’ve only won when they commit fewer turnovers than their opponents… which, coincidentally, has only happened once this season.

### Digesting the News: Injuries and Recent Form

UT Martin’s recent 75-50 win over Brescia was a snoozefest for the neutral fan, a la “watching a spreadsheet update itself.” Star forward Matas Deniusas dropped 14 points, but their real strength is their defense, which stifles opponents into shooting 26.4% from three. Andrija Bukumirovic, their 65.7% shooter, is the team’s human equivalent of a Swiss Army knife—reliable, efficient, and occasionally u
