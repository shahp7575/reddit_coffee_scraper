I (24f) recently went on a date with a woman I met through a mutual friend, let‚Äôs call her Carrie (25f). We had our first date at a coffee shop and clicked well, Carrie offered to pay and I let her because it‚Äôs just coffee. We planned to go to dinner for our second date. We went to a fairly nice restaurant where we again had a great time and connected well over poetry and music we like and had some deep conversations. I was certainly sure I would want to go on more dates with this woman, as a lesbian dating is very difficult but I was so hopeful about this one. I am a vegetarian and have been since I was 14. In my version of vegetarianism, my concern is not about actually eating meat, but purchasing it. I would eat meat if it was going to go to waste anyway, but I refuse to buy meat products for myself or others because purchase of meat increases demand of meat, which increases supply and leads to more animals being killed. Some people don‚Äôt get this but it‚Äôs the ideology I‚Äôve always had about my diet. Anyways, Carrie is not a vegetarian and ordered the sea bass at this restaurant. When the bill came, she kind of ignored it I guess in hopes that I would pick it up. I awkwardly asked her if she minded getting this one because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable buying meat and explained to her my whole vegetarian ideology thing. She asked if I wanted to split the bill in half. I said no, I would only pay for what I got (I ordered something significantly cheaper than she did). She agreed and we both paid for our respective meals, but the rest of the date was awkward and quiet. I didn‚Äôt get any texts or calls from Carrie, but our mutual friend texted me that it was rude that I refused to pay for our dinner even though Carrie paid last time. This text set me off because I was already feeling kind of iffy about the situation and I immediately got defensive (a bad habit of mine) I argued that it wasn‚Äôt fair for Carrie to expect me to pay for a whole dinner when she only paid for coffee, and she shouldn‚Äôt have offered to pay for our first date if she expected something in return for it. However, the more I thought about it, the more I felt guilty and that my friend had a point. I apologized to Carrie over text about my rudeness over paying for dinner but I haven‚Äôt gotten a text back. Obviously this isn‚Äôt a big deal since it was only the second date but I‚Äôm worried that I ruined what could have been a good relationship over my petty behavior.

1iixizq,https://www.reddit.com/r/womenintech/comments/1iixizq/needy_male_recruiter/,Needy Male Recruiter,"I know I'm a person who people feel easy to chat with and even in a professional setting, I can get people to feel at ease and safe with me.

There's a company in my area whom I've dealt with two of their male recruiters and I'm beginning to see they have culture problem.

Back a few years ago I was looking for a role and now as well due to lay offs.

Please share how you'd deal with this mentally as it feels like harassment. 
Male 1
- young guy, looks like he thinks the world of himself and tries to be smooth. After I receive an offer elsewhere and told him he asked me for coffee about every few months for a year and also emailed and called me. I only picked up once and the message was the same. He said he would like to know what my work entails in the new job and how we can collaborate together in the future as he's in for a promotion and would like some industry knowledge
My response : blocking on calls and emails and maybe even LI.. so far nothing 

Male 2
- just started as a recruiter after working as a research manager in industry
- is an acquaintance of a colleague and I got his contact via her WhatsApp
- I contacted him on LI after he accepted connection and we had a video call on LI. Wasn't inappropriate and since the job had a tight timeline he was very good about setting expectations 
- a few days later he whstsapped me asking for birthday information (minus year) for the application. Because of the tight timeline I replied ok WhatsApp. Then he had other questions and would get terms wrong which felt like a text chain because I'm correcting him. I did not enjoy that.
Other weird stuff : asking me to get a reference from THAT company, asking me to go ""unofficial"" routes to find more info about subject matter on that role because he cannot provide, TELLING ME HE WANTS TO KNOW ALL THE OTHER INTERVIEWS I GOT AND IF IM ADVANCING so he can put pressure on his client (this feels too intimate and uncomfortable)
- not being sure who the hiring manager is but gives me a name and when I said I contacted them he said don't contact the hiring manager (which when asl he is still not sure who to it is : ""I think it's him"")
- got a call when I got an interview from his client on WhatsApp. Productive call but do not enjoy using social media for this. I tolerated due to the tight timelines
- the next time he texted again I said I'll email you the answer and let's take the conversation there. Then the next time he had a different question he texted me on WhatsApp. So nauseating 
- when I got a second interview he asked who it was with which is so weird... It's like I'm an insatiable thirst and he wants to have contact with me everyday now leading up to my inzerviews. And why wouldn't he know who his clients are ??
- told me the company offers coaching before the interview and since male 1 also did that and it wasn't valuable I said no and make 1 started to strongly suggest it saying it's how they do business and their client wants this. I spoke to two older colleagues of mine who suggested to play nice and do the coaching to show I can follow rules. It feels like he IS STRONG ARMING me onto this because he sent the invite in a time I was ok with and CC his manager (another dude) to ""add value"" even though we agreed we could cancel this meeting five minutes in if I didn't see any value. Feels like STRONG ARMING when he said if I didn't do it they will have to tell their client that I refused coaching. I have a problem with MEDIOCRE men coaching me !!


I am sick of male 2's constant want for contact and questions which make him look incompetent and creepy. I mentioned male 2 about male 1 in a way of that I don't want to change recruiters and want to stick with male 2 but now I feel like I want to fail at the interview to not deal with any of them. Recruiters are parasites anyway but these ones seem creepy to me and it may be company culture. I feel stressed and lose sleep over the potential of having contact with them. And I actually need to feel fresh and ready for the interviews.

Iwas in Poblacion, Makati and this happened around 3:30 pm. After getting coffee, I decided to walk around. Medyo napagod ako, so I went to uncle john's to buy water. After ko bumili I sat down for a bit kasi sobrang pagod na ako. There was this guy outside na naka color navy blue na polo at naka-bike and one detail i remember clearly is that may sugat siya sa noo. Hindi ko siya masyado napansin agad kasi I was busy talking to my friend sa phone, Magkaharap kami and since glass yung harap ng store kita kami sa loob at labas. At first, I didn't mind na nagkakatinginan kami kasi I thought he was just there waiting for someone or like resting or what. Pero guess what?? he was doing something disgusting na pala sobrang inappropriate. The moment I noticed it, I moved to the corner para hindi na niya ako makita. Doon ko napansin na pati yung mga katabi kong girls sa loob napansin na rin yung ginagawa niya. They stood up agad, and bigla rin umalis yung guy when he noticed na nakita na siya. We were super shocked and traumatized, hindi namin alam anong gagawin. Kaya lumabas kami and thankfully may mga patrol sa labas. We immediately reported it, and they told us na magpapatrol sila around the area.  

Pero here's the scary part, tangina we saw him again. doing the same thing to another girl. Nakunan ko siya ng video this time. Nagsisisi lang ako kasi I could've kicked his bike or confronted him, pero sobrang shocked na ako to even react that way.  It seems like paikot-ikot lang siya sa Poblacion. I don't know if may naka-experience na rin nito before, but please stay alert, especially if you're around the area. This really ruined my day kasi it was my birthday pa naman, and I was having a good time before this happened.  

Please be careful, and don't hesitate to report incidents like this sa authorities and I hope this won't happen again to anyone else.",2,1738828710.0,MayConfessionAko,0,0.75,False

Coffee is a beloved morning ritual for many. It wakes us up and prepares us for the day ahead. But making a great pot of coffee is an art. With just a few steps, you can enjoy a rich, flavorful brew each time.

Whether you‚Äôre a coffee newbie or a seasoned drinker, this guide will help you brew the perfect pot. You‚Äôll learn about the right coffee-to-water ratio, the best grind size, and the importance of water temperature.¬†[Let‚Äôs dive in and make your mornings even better with a perfect pot of coffee.](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-pots/)

# Choosing Your Coffee Beans

Making a pot of coffee is an art. The most crucial step is choosing your coffee beans. The right beans can make or break your brew. Let‚Äôs explore how to select the best coffee beans for a perfect pot of coffee.

# Types Of Coffee Beans

Understanding the different types of coffee beans is essential. Each type has its own unique flavor profile. The main types are Arabica and Robusta.

Here are some key points about each:

* **Arabica:**¬†Known for its smooth, complex flavors. Often has fruity or floral notes.
* **Robusta:**¬†Stronger and more bitter. Contains more caffeine. Often used in espresso blends.

There are also other less common types:

* **Liberica:**¬†Unique and rare. It has a woody, smoky flavor.
* **Excelsa:**¬†Often found in blends. Adds a tart, fruity taste.

Let‚Äôs compare these types in a table:

|Type|Flavor|Caffeine Content|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Arabica|Smooth, complex, fruity|Lower|
|Robusta|Strong, bitter|Higher|
|Liberica|Woody, smoky|Medium|
|Excelsa|Tart, fruity|Medium|

Choosing the right type depends on your taste preference. If you like a smooth and mild coffee, go for Arabica. If you need a strong kick, Robusta might be your choice.

# Freshness Matters

Freshness is key to a great cup of coffee. Coffee beans start to lose their flavor soon after roasting. Always look for the roast date on the packaging.

Here are some tips for ensuring freshness:

1. **Buy whole beans:**¬†Ground coffee loses freshness faster.
2. **Store properly:**¬†Keep beans in an airtight container. Store in a cool, dark place.
3. **Use quickly:**¬†Try to use beans within a month of roasting.

Let‚Äôs summarize the effects of freshness:

|Freshness|Flavor|Quality|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Freshly Roasted|Rich, vibrant|High|
|1 Month Old|Decent, less vibrant|Medium|
|3 Months Old|Dull, stale|Low|

Remember, the fresher the beans, the better the coffee. Always check the roast date and buy in small amounts to keep your coffee fresh. Your taste buds will thank you.

Written and edited by the¬†[MCAT Self Prep Tutoring Team](https://mcatselfprep.com/elite-mcat-tutoring/)

¬†¬†Home of the¬†[Free MCAT Prep Course](https://mcatselfprep.com/)

All of your MCAT practice tests should lead to you to test day. Your prep material should mirror the material that AAMC expects you to know. MCAT practice tests should lead you to test day as well. Most students who have taken the MCAT will consistently cite taking practice tests as the most important part of their preparation. However, MCAT¬†[practice tests](https://mcatselfprep.com/free-and-low-cost-mcat-practice-exams/)¬†can improve your MCAT score even more if you use them to simulate test-day conditions. As part of our¬†[FREE online MCAT course](https://mcatselfprep.com/ecourse-home/), we walk our students through every aspect of the material on test-day. But how can you simulate the test day experience if you‚Äôve never taken the real thing? Here are a few pro-tips and aspects of test-day that will help you maximize the benefit from your MCAT practice tests. You can trust me,¬†[I scored a perfect 528](https://mcatselfprep.com/how-i-achieved-a-perfect-score-528-on-the-mcat/)¬†using only MCAT Self Prep and self-studying. I maximized my score because I spent hundreds of hours trying to understand the AAMC and how they think. Before test day, you can understand their logic too.¬†

# Using the Tutorial Time to Your Advantage

Before your MCAT practice tests, you will encounter a 10-minute tutorial that walks you through every feature of the MCAT software. For your first MCAT practice test, we recommend that you use this time to learn about all of the features at your disposal. You can¬†highlight¬†text using ALT+H (Option+H for Mac users) and¬†strike-through¬†using ALT+S (Option+S for Mac users) and many other keyboard shortcuts. Once you‚Äôve familiarized yourself with these features, you can skip through this introduction to get right to the test in future practice scenarios. Most MCAT prep courses will recommend that you skip this section on test day as well. But on test day, every minute that you‚Äôre given is precious.¬†

One pro-tip that can boost your score is using this 10-minute introduction to create a cheat sheet for your test day. On test-day, you are given a¬†booklet of dry-erase sheets¬†(I bought these sheets online and found it to be very helpful to practice with). During the introduction, you can write down every memorization-heavy concept that you find difficult to remember. Some examples are:

1. all of the amino acid R groups,¬†
2. stages of development according to various psychologists (Piaget, Erickson, Freud)¬†
3. a list of 10-20 physics equations¬†
4. a prototypical voltaic cell
5. brain regions and their functions

Spend an hour during the day or two before your test to create this list ahead of time. Then practice copying this list down from memory over and over again until you can do so effortlessly. This allows you to memorize this information in your short-term memory, to augment your long term memory of these memorization-heavy concepts. Bring this list with you to the testing center so you can glance at it one last time before you head in to take your test. Copy it down again right before you sign in. This way you‚Äôve written your cheat sheet down only 3-5 minutes before you start your test! Once you are seated in the exam chair, advance to the introduction section, and you will be given 10 minutes to copy this cheat sheet down before starting. Let the time slowly run down while you copy everything that you‚Äôve practiced. Now you‚Äôll have a cheat list that will save you plenty of time once your exam starts!¬†

Again, we want to simulate test-taking conditions as much as possible when taking MCAT practice tests. If you start with the end in mind, you will know that on test day, you will have your cheat list in front of you. So an option is to take your MCAT¬†practice tests¬†with this reference sheet in front of you! Hooray! Spend time crafting your reference sheet now to help with memorizing pesky physics equations! (However, we do recommend that you don‚Äôt take MCAT practice tests with the amino acid R groups in front of you as you should know them like the back of your hand even without the reference sheet)

COVID-19 testing addendum:¬†If you are taking the MCAT with the COVID length sections, you will only be given 3 minutes + 90 seconds for the introduction and opening section page. We recommend only copying one memorization-heavy concept down in this time (all the amino acid R groups, 10-20 physics equations etc.)

# Noise Cancelation and Screen Dimensions

The next two things you may notice when you sit down to take your test is the noise cancelation options and the dimensions of your screen. PearsonVUE testing centers offer two methods of noise cancelation for every student: over-the-ear headphones and ear-plugs. I tried both. In my experience, the headphones they offered were fine. They feel like ear protection for construction workers, not¬†high-quality over-the-ear headphones. However, most people don‚Äôt like using ear plugs and opt for the headphones. I, however, decided to use ear-plugs. It‚Äôs a personal preference, but you should decide what method you‚Äôll use right away and use that form of noise-cancellation for your MCAT practice tests. (But if you like studying with noise-canceling headphones, they¬†buy a good pair¬†and practice with them before test-day. I bought the pair that I linked and they‚Äôve completely changed my studying game.)¬†

The next thing that may throw you off is the screen dimensions. The MCAT will be administered on Windows desktops (remember ALT+H for highlighting if you use a Mac!). If possible, take your MCAT practice tests on desktops with a mouse instead of a laptop. This will actually help you save time as you can navigate faster with a mouse. The dimensions of the test will also be squared (like an Instagram picture) with black bars on either side. While this may seem like an unimportant detail, the squared dimensions makes the CARS passages seem longer because you need to scroll more to get through them. Pro Tip: all CARS passage word counts are within a 50-word range, so they are actually the same length. So when taking MCAT practice tests, square your browser screen to simulate this effect.

COVID-19 testing addendum:¬†If you are taking the MCAT with the COVID length sections, you will be required to test with a mask on. Using a mask and over-the-ear headphones simultaneously can hurt your ears and so we advise against this unless you practice beforehand. With social distancing, there will be half the students in your testing room and so you may not even need any form of noise-cancellation. We also recommend using a¬†high-quality and BREATHABLE mask¬†to help with breathing instead of face-fitted N95s.

# Taking Breaks

Because the MCAT lasts almost an entire day, you will be allowed to take 3 breaks during your test-day experience. Your breaks will last 10, 30, and 10 minutes after your Chemistry and Physics, CARS, and Biology and Biochemistry sections respectively. To make the most of these breaks, successful test-takers will fuel up with both foods and liquids. We think of taking the MCAT as running a marathon. It‚Äôs long. It‚Äôs hard. This endurance requires a constant and consistent output of energy. Marathon runners refuel by eating¬†protein bars¬†and other healthy foods. As you may know from your studies, sugary foods burn fast and bright but lead to physical and cognitive crashes after they are used up. We recommend eating and drinking as you would for a marathon (including frequent bathroom breaks). However, finding your own balance is the most important aspect of MCAT nutrition. Experiment with nutrition during your breaks for your first few MCAT practice tests until you find out what works for you. For test-day, bring more food, water, and caffeine than you think you‚Äôll need. Don‚Äôt forget to bring a¬†water bottle¬†too!¬†

A word on caffeine: Just as you want to maintain consistent levels of blood sugar to prevent crashes, make sure to keep a consistent caffeine intake if you choose to use it. It‚Äôs much better to sip on a caffeinated beverage at each of your breaks rather than chugging 2 coffees right before the test starts. I personally practiced with¬†caffeinated Cliff Shot blocks¬†so I didn‚Äôt have to pee as often from drinking too much liquid (caffeine is also a diuretic). If you feel yourself crashing before the final section, feel free to pound caffeine to get you over the final hump because you can always crash later. As a natural alternative or supplement, I also did push-ups and jumping jacks during my breaks to wake my body up. Keeping the blood flowing can restart your focus after sitting in front of a computer for hours on end.¬†

We instantly hit it off and we have a ton of chemistry. We are constantly joking and bantering with each other and always laughing together. Additionally, our life goals and values are pretty much identical. I was debating asking her out after graduation (I don‚Äôt dip my pen in the company ink and I was working up the courage). The night of our graduation from the course, a group of us went out to eat to celebrate. I rode home with some buddies from the restaurant and one of them, out of the blue, turned around and said: ‚ÄúHey man, you and (this girl) have awesome chemistry and it‚Äôs very clear she‚Äôs into you, you should ask her out.‚Äù This was the push I needed, so I said fuck it and called her the second I got home. I asked her out and she said yes. We went out the following night and it was the best date I‚Äôve ever been on. At the end of the evening I asked her out on a second date and she agreed. The next day she FaceTimed me and said ‚ÄúI like you but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready for anything romantic because I‚Äôve been in some really shitty relationships, however, I want to keep hanging out‚Äù. I told her that I completely understand where she‚Äôs coming from and all I want is for to feel comfortable and at peace. I also told her that I really like her and that it‚Äôs going to be emotionally difficult for me to keep hanging out if there‚Äôs not defined ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù for our relationship/friendship. She said she understood that and she just needed time to see where it goes.

We‚Äôve hung out multiple times since then. She invited me over to play a board game late one night, we‚Äôve gone to the gym together, we‚Äôve grabbed coffee, lunch, went to a scenic spot outside of the city to watch the sunset and went to a bookstore together. It‚Äôs been awesome except for one thing: I‚Äôm falling so hard and fast for her. Everything she does hits me like a ton of bricks and I see myself digging a hole that I can‚Äôt get out of. Hanging out with her and her daughter swapped out my proverbial shovel for an auger and I‚Äôm so fucked lmfao. 

I‚Äôve had my fair share of shitty relationships too. I‚Äôve been cheated on twice and left because of how demanding my job is. I‚Äôm so emotionally exhausted with dating in general and I feel like I can‚Äôt get crushed again.

How do I gauge/ask if she‚Äôs ready for something romantic while simultaneously respecting:
1) her comfort and healing process
2) my comfort and and sanity

1iixebu,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1iixebu/low_ketones/,Low Ketones,"Hi everyone 

Looking to understand why my ketone levels are so low despite eating a very low carb diet. 

36 y/o female. 164cm/5foot4inches tall 67kg/157pounds. I am relatively lean, and carry good muscle mass. Very active lifestyle , doing competitive crossfit and weightlifting. 

I have been eating a carnivor-ish diet (only animal products - meat, dairy and eggs) for 2 months now. I don‚Äôt measure ketones initially. But after not losing any weight on the diet. I have started to track a bit to help me understand how my body responds to food. 

I have been tracking calories, macros and blood glucose and ketones for the last week. 

Glucose - wearing a CGM , these stats look good, always within range, almost zero spikes associated with food. Some spikes associated with high intensity exercise 

Ketones - using urine strips and finger prick ketone monitor. The urine sticks give me a negative (no ketones present) and my blood ketones are 0.2 - 0.3 


For the past 2 months have been strict but had one or two ‚Äòcheat days‚Äô  but for the last week I have tracked and ensured my carbs are under 10grams daily. 

What my meals and days have  looked like while tracking 

6am butter in coffee with some heavy cream 
7am exercise this is usually 90mins weightlifting or 60mins higher intensity crossfit style exercise and often followed by 1 hour of padel tennis 

11/12ish meal: 3 lamb loin chops with butter and 2-3 fried eggs 

3ish sometimes if I‚Äôm feeling peckish some dried meat sticks and 100g double cream Greek yoghurt 

6pmish 300g ribeye steak with butter 

8ish keto hot chocolate with whipped cream 


I‚Äôm eating 70% fat and 28% protein with a little carbs coming from the bit of dairy. 

I‚Äôm really confused why I don‚Äôt have urine or blood ketones despite 2 months on low carb eating

I check the labels on everything. There are definitely no sneaky carbs in the foods I‚Äôm eating. I eat very simply ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

for example, semi-recently they knew i wanted to watch bring it on, and i even had the dvd ready to go when they were. turns out they just watched it without me while i was at work when i asked about it. and whatever, at least i have the dvd and can watch it by myself.

so, this time i want to know if i'm being more upset than i should. we only have netflix in the living room. i can't get it on my phone, or in my own room. a while ago, when i was home alone, i decided to watch knives out: glass onion, because why not? i have the living room to myself for once, and there were no prior discussions about it. my parents came home midway through and told me to turn it off because THEY wanted to watch it from the beginning. i told them okay, and turned it off, saying that when they DID want to watch it to let me know, so we could all watch it together.

cut to today, i've been putting off watching it this whole time. i mentioned a few times about watching it when they were deciding on a movie, since it was up for grabs. didn't pick it. i left the room after a different movie ended and took a nap, and when i woke up to prep my coffee, they were watching it. WITHOUT me, after i JUST mentioned we should watch it and that i was waiting for them to want to watch it, too. not to mention, they started it by the time i would've normally been asleep for work the next day, so i can't even jump in partway and enjoy it. they didn't ask, nor did they mention they were going to watch it.

i know it sounds like a petty thing to be upset about, but it hurts my feelings a lot. especially when i have no other way of watching this movie, and they made ME turn it off when i tried to watch it on my own. i didn't want to be an asshole and get mad at them for it, so i just left the room without saying anything.

TL;DR my parents watched an exclusive movie without me, after i specifically told them i wanted to watch it, too. am i overreacting? or should i just deal with it? i've been holding back on saying anything to them about this because i feel like if i do, they'll just tell me to get over it.",2,1738828072.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

I am 24F and just recently broke up with my most recent boyfriend. I have been pretty lonely after moving to my home state, and was wondering if I should reach out to the sister (21F) of my high school/college ex (not my most recent ex, but the one before) to hang out as friends? I dated her brother probably 5-6 years ago at this point.

Her and I always got along really well and always would say that if he had been in the same year, we would be best friends. She is three years younger, and that age gap seemed a little too big to really be close friends in high school/college. Now that we are both adults, I was wondering if it would be appropriate to ask her to get coffee or something.

I would have reached out a year or so ago, but my most recent ex thought it would be weird to reach out to her to be friends after a few years of only seeing each other in passing.",1,1738827211.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had a productive morning, well *midmorning* I should say. I have‚Ä¶.

* Washed my makeup brushes 
* Put all my laundry and bits around the house away and folded up M‚Äôs towels too
* Cleaned the kitchen and did the dishwasher 
* Cleaned my coffee machine bits 
* Packed 
* Tidied up my room
* Broke down a bunch of cardboard boxes for the recycling bin 
* Had a quick body shower because I felt yuck after the aforementioned chores 
* Had some lunch 
* Closed up the house 

And then all the usual bits like making my bed but I do that every single day so. 

I got the train. It was soooooo sunny for the whole trip and I just basked in it like a lil lizard opting to forget the fact that it was killing my skin. I felt a bit uncomfy as my boobs were kind of *out* - I didn‚Äôt mean for them to be but the top and bra combo wasn‚Äôt it. Anyway I could feel eyes on them on both train trips and I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it so I felt kind of yuck. It‚Äôs so funny how I just do not care for handsome men that aren‚Äôt my own, aka Andy. An objectively very handsome guy sat next to me on the first train - not my type but tall and built and very tan and blonde and a really pretty face - but I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs like no other men are interesting to me unless they‚Äôre either a) my honeybunny or b) fictional faeries with wings and purpley eyes. 

I think I smelled nice today? I don‚Äôt know. But I kept smelling something delicious and wasn‚Äôt sure what or who it was but it was at the first station, on the first train and on the second train and the common denominator there was me so that‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs me but I didn‚Äôt do anything special - I showered and put a tiny bit of solid perfume on my wrists and neck and cleavage and that‚Äôs it. And I don‚Äôt think it was the perfume smell? I think maybe it was a mixture of my lingering bodywash which is a warm sweet almondy amber and my perfume is like an irisy musky amber - so those two combined with my shampoo even? Because I am going to wash my hair tonight as it‚Äôs day two or three but it still smells nice because of my serum/oil which is like a violetty sandalwood with a tiny bit of citrus. So I think maybe just a random combo of all three? Because I would just get little wafts here and there. Idk but it was nice. I hope it was me :) It‚Äôs just odd as I didn‚Äôt put any effort in so I just at first presumed not. Anyway. 

Sometimes I think it would be fun to study some form of art history or theory or something idk what‚Äôs even out there. Not because I know anything about it or really even care to, I mean I would like to but not that badly, I just love looking at it! Like on the train earlier, I was reading through my notes app and clearing things out and randomly from like 2022 have ‚ÄúLeonora Carrington‚Äù written down and nothing else so naturally I google and anyway she‚Äôs a surrealist painter and then I just spent a decent length of time just google image stalking her works. And she‚Äôs incredibly famous, like if I‚Äôve heard of someone then they‚Äôre gonna be huge,  but I imagine you‚Äôd get introduced to so many artists and works through studying, no? Like for example the people who inspired or took inspo from Leonora and the pieces *they* made and so on. I think that would be so fun. I realise there‚Äôs nothing stopping me from doing this on my own time as I write this. I‚Äôve added it to my list. I feel like I set restrictions on myself a lot, I mean *duh* but also I see myself as a certain person and anything that might take me away from that self imposed image of myself is something not for me. Like creative hobbies, I don‚Äôt see myself as a creative person but why is that? Because I love it. Is it because I‚Äôm no good at anything? I think so. And because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm good enough of a person to rely on my own urges and create something worthwhile out of them, yknow? Like it feels like a waste of time. But how can I know I‚Äôm no good at something if I don‚Äôt allow myself time to practice and play? Like who tf even knows? For example I don‚Äôt consider myself someone who likes art, but why is that? Because I don‚Äôt know the theory or history or understand it? Because yeah I know nothing, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt *like* it, does it? I don‚Äôt like it because they used a certain brush stroke or idk made a clock feminist or something, I just like the colours they use and combine together or the textures and the patterns or the minor detail included. I think I can like how it looks without needing to know the whole universe surrounding it, no? I just don‚Äôt say I like art because I feel like it implies something that I have nothing to back with. Like if I said I like this painting and someone asked why and I say because I love the shade of yellow and the way the fabric is painted? That makes me look dumb. So I just enjoy everything in my own mind. Hm. Is that being my ‚Äúauthentic self‚Äù? No. Hm. Anyway now I‚Äôve also found Remedios Varo so I‚Äôm gonna go look at some weird stuff now. 

Goddddddd I love him so much. He‚Äôs so f‚Äôing wonderful. Sometimes I get so overcome with love I want to punch a hole in a wall. 

I feel like know so little about my parents lives sometimes. Like today in the drive to their house dad was telling me about his time spent in Jerusalem and how he loved it and I was like wait what when did you go there - he‚Äôs been to SO many places - like he said he traveled so much for awhile that he didn‚Äôt even know where he was sometimes, I think that was when he was driving across the Middle East sort of thing. I think in the 70s. Imagine getting to see Iran and these places in the 70s before it turned into what it is now. 

Puppy was so excited to see me :) Both mum and dad were too. It made me feel really nice. Dad was waiting on the train station platform for me in a bright yellow shirt waving. Mum came to the gate down the driveway to hug me hello when we arrived, and then dad wanted a hug and then I said FAMILY HUG and barrelled into them both. And then I came inside and puppy went *berserk* and now I have scratches all over my chest because he was going to mental over me and I just loved it. And they both keep saying how happy they are to have me here and all that. 

I have no plans for the long weekend here. Mum wants to go see a movie but they‚Äôre only at night time and idk how that works with my time with Andy so idk if I can or should go to the movie with her. Otherwise I want to read lots, go for walks, have a real fruit frozen yoghurt, go for brunch, do the crossword, have puppy cuddles galore and maybe do some baking? 

Time to spend the evening with my honey :)

Or familiarize myself with current tech?","Hi all, I'm job hunting for an entry level role in aerospace and am wondering if I'm going about finding resources incorrectly or inefficiently. In technical interviews, I tend to do well when it's involving theoretical questions or questions similar to classic textbooks ones. For example, theoretical heat transfer between coffee-milk-environment. Or, more textbook-like heat transfer through pipes or layered materials.

However, I tend to get very flustered when it's applied to something beyond that. I've gotten questions about satellites, solar panels, liquid engines, etc. I try my best to use my intuition and at least approach it in a simplified way to get ballpark answers, but I don't think I hit the mark. I'd like to get more familiar with industry scenarios, and find resources that would help me with that. How can I get more familiar with the basic components of various space technologies, and basic scenarios they'd have to consider? For example, in a previous interview I wasn't too familiar with electronics packaging.

As of right now, I try to find published academic papers but I feel like I'm not retaining much, and I'm unsure if these specific experiments are reflective of common industry practices.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! (I included thermal examples, but I'm interviewing for many types of roles, including structures, manufacturing, so more generic advice/resources would be helpful!) Thanks in advance all!",1,1738826994.0,EngineeringStudents,0,1.0,False

This is quite a long post so you can skip this whole backstory if you just want to hear about how I manifested my current relationship.

# Back Story

In May 2023, I came into conscious manifesting wanting to manifest an SP back. I did all the techniques one could think of and I was endlessly searching for another technique I could try or whether I was indeed the ‚Äúsabbath state‚Äù which I thought would mean my SP was coming back in three days ‚Äî to make the long story short: No, he didn‚Äôt come back.

I kept on looking for validation in the 3D and forcing things to the point that he threatened to block me for harassing him.

I let him go after that and decided I would manifest a new man into my life. I scripted the traits I wanted in my ideal man and after two weeks, I met him in a dating app. I then manifested commitment from him by robotically affirming ‚ÄúI am in a loving and committed relationship with X‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am the best and the only option.‚Äù However, I hadn‚Äôt changed who I was being. I was very insecure, very anxiously attached to this man and I didn‚Äôt know how to regulate my emotions. He felt like I didn‚Äôt trust him no matter what he did or he didn‚Äôt do. In the relationship, I was always acting out of fear, instead of acting out of love. *And when you act out of fear, the other person can feel that energy and it can make them feel pressured or smothered*. My insecurities were so bad, this guy encouraged me to go to therapy; To make the long story short, he broke up with me in the end.

I spent another few months trying to manifest him back with no success. For a few months after that, it was a cycle of me meeting new guys and then them leaving/rejecting me. I had to get really honest with myself and deeply reflect who I was being in these connections. I also had to reflect on why I placed such a heavy importance on romantic partners to prove to myself that I was loved instead of giving that love to myself. I stayed single for a few months, worked on other aspects of my life like my career and my social life. I learned how to see and acknowledge that yes, there was so much love around me in my family and in my friends. I started a gratitude journal and everyday, I was grateful for all of them. I just started romanticizing the little things in my life and it made me realize how much I was taking some things for granted just because I placed such a heavy importance on having a romantic partner. I learned how to create happiness within and as a bonus, I manifested my dream life within a year, which included [moving to my dream continent.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1ifzwsc/moved_to_the_continent_of_my_dreams/)

# My current relationship

Once I got to my new country, I decided that I was ready to date again so I got on dating apps again. At this point, I already loved and valued myself so much that I wasn‚Äôt willing to put myself in a position where I didn‚Äôt feel safe with a man. I've had quite a few first dates and a few more dates with potential men. I learned how to walk away from men who didn't give me what I want. I didn‚Äôt get a committed relationship right off the bat but being able to respond differently to situations with men was already proof that I was growing emotionally and mentally, and I took it as a sign I was in the right direction.

Almost a month in, I met my now boyfriend. He‚Äôs very into mindfulness, meditation, and doing the inner work^(1). Our conversations online were really good so I agreed to go on a date with him. However, it took a few weeks to schedule it because I had quite a few trips booked and exams to study for and I didn‚Äôt want to change my schedule for him^(2)

Our first date was a hike to the mountains with his city^(3) as our base. He told me I could sleep in his place. This made me uncomfortable so I communicated to him hours before me traveling to his city that I didn‚Äôt do sex on the first date*^(4)* and if he was expecting it, then I‚Äôm cancelling the date. He was very understanding of my boundaries and told me that he only has one bed so we‚Äôll sleep in separate blankets. Now, when we talk about how we first met, he‚Äôd say that he liked it when I communicated my expectations early on.¬†

Now I'm in a happy, healthy, and loving relationship with this man who loves and supports me. He‚Äôs been faithful to me ever since our first date, way before we decided to go exclusive. One of my biggest ""hurdles"" this year is my application for a long-term residence permit and looking for a job here but he's promised that he's got my back financially whenever the need arises. As I said, he does the inner work as well, so whenever we have disagreements, they never get explosive. We're able to calmly talk it out and figure out solutions that work for the both of us. He gets me flowers every time I come to his city and even during random weeknights.

# What I did:

1. Meditation - I used to do 10 mins in the morning, and 10 at night (+ an additional one within the day whenever I find myself getting too anxious). Now I just do this once a day, 15-20 minutes.
2. Affirmation tapes - Part of my everyday routine is to do at least two affirmation tapes in the morning and two in the evening. These are tapes on various topics I wanted to focus on, and not just romance.
3. Centered my affirmations on me (‚ÄúI identify as someone who is securely attached to my partner,‚Äù ‚ÄúI deserve a healthy and lasting relationship,‚Äù ‚ÄúI am the prize‚Äù as opposed to SP-centered affirmations like, ‚ÄúSP loves me,‚Äù ‚ÄúSP is obsessed with me‚Äù)
4. Gratitude journal - Shifts your focus to whatever you have in the present, over what you lack. This made me feel so happy about my life, way before I successfully manifested the ‚Äúbig things.‚Äù
5. EFT tapping (optional) - Whenever I don‚Äôt feel comfortable tapping, I simply repeat the script in my mind or out loud.
6. Cut back on coffee üíî I used to drink two to three cups of coffee daily, not knowing it was fueling my anxiety and disregulating my nervous system. For some people, it boosts their performance but if you have an anxious brain like me, it‚Äôs best if you cut back or be aware enough of how coffee affects your thoughts and feelings throughout the day.

# What I stopped doing:

1. Engaging with content that wasn‚Äôt aligned with what I wanted to experience - Sure, a lot of dating-related memes and reels on Tiktok are very funny but they usually tell us the story of dating being toxic or of people being unfaithful. I used to be able to relate to them and laugh at them, but with my new identity, I feel the ‚Äúick‚Äù towards this type of content and a lot of times, feel sorry for whoever posted it. *If you‚Äôre someone who attracts healthy relationships, would you be able to relate to this type of content? Would you be sharing/reposting them?*¬†
2. Looking through every romance-related success story to see what they did differently this time. There is no magic technique. Once you know the basics and once you know how to regulate your nervous system, you‚Äôre all set.
3. Trying to control every single thing in the 3D. Whenever an SP does something that triggers you, many people would advise you to just AFFIRM AFFIRM AFFIRM AND PERSIST until the SP changes their behavior or says what you want to hear. Yes, you can do this and yes, I've done this before but do you really think it's healthy in the long term to try and control every single thing instead of just letting things flow? I personally think the healthier approach is to manage your own triggers, reflect on why an action bothered you, and work through your insecurities. Plus, the greatest gift you can give to your person is to let them be themselves and then it's up to you to decide whether you want them in your life or not.
4. Being scared of being alone. I stopped going on dates with men who didn't make me feel safe, even if it meant I was going to be alone with no guy to talk to.
5. Labeling myself as anxiously-attached - I started identifying as somebody who is securely-attached. Yes, I still feel anxious at times and I still have insecurities that I‚Äôm working on but I remind myself that being securely-attached doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt get fearful or insecure anymore, but it means that you‚Äôre more able to regulate your emotions and that you‚Äôre more able to discern whether your thoughts are based on your current reality or whether you‚Äôre just projecting old stories and trauma from the past into this new connection.

No, I have never succeeded in manifested any of my old SPs back into my life. I may have manifested them viewing my stories from time to time even when we‚Äôre not mutuals on social media, but never anything big beyond that. That doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt believe that you can manifest SPs back into your life ‚Äî other peoples‚Äô success stories are proof that you can ‚Äî but seeing how damaging it was to me mentally, I just didn‚Äôt want to mentally persist for that; I loved and respected myself way too much to do so. I learned how to adapt the ‚ÄúTHIS or someone better‚Äù mindset because I knew I was growing every day and I knew I was always going to attract in someone who was more aligned to the woman I‚Äôm becoming.

And hey, even if you don‚Äôt have an SP yet, this is a great time to pour some love into yourself because you deserve it and it will greatly benefit you in the long run. ‚ù§Ô∏è

^(1)Ladies, someone doing the inner work deserves someone doing the inner work as well!

^(2)Seriously, unless he is already committed to you, never change your schedule for a man. The right man will wait!

^(3)I‚Äôd advise women not to travel for a first date unless he makes the necessary arrangements to make you as comfortable as possible

^(4)If you‚Äôre **comfortable** having sex on the first date, by all means, do it. Personally, I just didn‚Äôt feel comfortable as I wanted to get to know who he is as a person first before giving him access to my body.",4,1738826901.0,lawofattraction,0,1.0,False

A regular coffee combined with elvanse just makes me twitchy and wired.

But when I‚Äòm on my off days or in the morning when I have a late shift, I‚Äòve only got access to a Pour Over or a automatic espresso maker.

So would it be possible to get a perfect extracion every time? And if yes with what kind of machine? 

As far as I know, every coffee I‚Äòll make will be slightly different because of a lot pf factors, so we have to try to control as many as possible? But let‚Äôs assume I‚Äòm using a La Marzocco Linea Micra, but I only drink casually a cup of espresso, how do I assure that each shot I pull is good? And then, If I‚Äòd use a Flair 58 (with pressure gage) wouldn‚Äôt I have even more control thus having a good extraction almost everytime? 

And if I only drink an espresso casually at home not necessarily everyday, what Machine would give me the possibility to get the best extraction possible everythime?

(By all means, I am an armature so please bare with my hasty enthusiasm when referring to the quantum world)
So, it's my understanding that the two topics in my subject header are not only coffee black and egg white but cannot exist together. If I understand this all correctly... entanglement breaks the local part of local causality and vice versa. So we know entanglement has been proved and obviously we live in a macro, classical  reality (do we? ü§î) which was never second guessed until now I suppose. OK finally my question... if reality does not exist unless measured or observed... the whole ""if a tree falls in the forest"" scenario... if I am dweller amongst this particular forest and I'm the only one around and I know every single convex and concave of the surrounding topography and its organic inhabitants like the back of my hand plus I live within earshot of every tree and one day, whilst sipping tea in my serene cozy little cottage hear a tree fall... however with my back to the window, I did not see the tree fall, is it the same as seeing it or not seeing it? Is the action of audibly hearing  the tree fall but not seeing it, still an observation/measurement? If I were deaf or dead, would that tree still have made a sound? Are the sound of the tree falling and the tree actually falling two separate instances unrelated? Related? Which if they were related, that would infer cause and effect which means no entanglement and the tree always makes a sound regardless and hearing it means one can conclude it has felled. So I have many questions littered here. Please assist. 
Also, I  apologize for the crude explanations and inquiries but I am so curious and I want to hear other perspectives. ",0,1738826324.0,quantum,0,0.33,False

1iiwuj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1iiwuj7/niche_first_impressions_the_harmonist_memo_paris/,"Niche First Impressions: The Harmonist, Memo Paris, Penhaligon's, and more!","Hi everyone!

Went sniffing around and wreaking havok (not really) in my Neiman Marcus, as one does, and got my nose on many fragrances that were new to me! This pretty much cemented purple florals as one of my favorite notes, as when I looked up the notes for many of the ones I loved when I got home, they ALL had iris/heliotrope/violet to some degree. Lots of soft, creamy, powdery goodness, and a pretty lengthy post ahead! Would love to know everyone's thoughts, as always!

**THE HARMONIST**: I own and absolutely LOVE my little decant of Moon Glory, and their bottle designs are in my top 3, so I wanted to explore the house a little more! I can easily see myself owning full sizes of multiple of their fragrances.

* Guiding Water: Did not like this as much as I anticipated and was very, VERY shocked. Like, shocked to the point where I think I must have gotten a bad sniff or something and I'm willing to go in and smell it again. The notes sount like an ozonic, watery dream to me but for some reason I got NONE of that in the store and all white pepper. 5/10 for now but I will absolutely try it again to confirm.
* Magnetic Wood: I absolutely LOVE when I'm surprised by how much I love a fragrance, and based on the notes it wouldn't have piqued my interest either; it makes it that much more special and makes me feel lucky to have given it a chance! I don't typically go for woody scents at all, but the way the osmanthus and iris stick around instead of going away on my skin make this an absolute dream. It's so unique and unlike anything I've smelled before. I couldn't stop smelling myself as I walked out, and I could very easily go straight to full bottle if I had the means. 20/10.
* Yin Transformation: I expected I'd like this, and I was right. It's beautiful, feminine, and soft. However, where Magnetic Wood was an instant rave for me, I'm still deciding if the scent profile on this is special enough to justify that price tag. Right now, I would own a travel size at most, but that BOTTLE. omfg. 7/10, half a point of which comes from the bottle.

**MEMO PARIS**: I like Inle a lot, so I definitely wanted to try their other fragrances. Plus, those bottles are so beautiful! Walked away with multiple new loves and a bag full of samples thanks to the extremely kind vendor that was there!

* Siwa: Phenomenal. This is the perfect balance of sweet and powdery on my skin, and I cannot say enough how much I like it. I can see why some people might not think this is the most special or unique scent in its category, but it did something on my skin that was like magic. I don't know if it's straight to full size magic, but magic nonetheless. 10/10.
* Inverness: Iris and a LOT of wood. Unfortunately this was too woody for me, which is a shame because the iris/orris in the back is EXACTLY how I like my iris to smell. Not too crasy about the plaid design on the bottle either. 4/10.
* Madurai: The extremely kind vendor let me choose 2 to create larger samples of, and this was one of them. I feel sad to say that I regret my decision, not because this was bad by any metric, but because there were others that in retrospect I know I liked more. It smelled very pretty on first sniff, hence my decision, but I suspect my nose was fatigued or something because when I smelled it later on skin, it was nothing special imo. A pretty, feminine jasmine. 5/10.
* Granada: Also like magic. Fluffy and beautiful, similar in essence/effect but not in scent to Siwa; I'd probably only own one of the two, and I haven't decided which one. The heliotrope and the tonka really come out on my skin, which is so beautiful. The grenadine at the beginning is fun too. Beautiful experience, and it would be incredibly difficult for me to choose between this and Siwa. 10/10.
* Sintra: This is the one I should have gotten a larger sample of instead of Madurai. I don't typically like scents that are punchy with the white florals, but somehow this makes it work; either that, or I like the other notes so much that it makes it okay. If you find Kilian's Love Don't Be Shy too screechy and nauseating like I do, this is like that but if someone turned down the volume. Definitely want to smell again, very pleasant. 8/10.
* Marfa: I am sad but not surprised that I didn't really like this much, probably because I'm not a huge white floral girl. It's nice, but nothing about it made that switch flip in my brain. Sweet, vanilla tuberose. BEAUTIFUL bottle design though, and I know many really like it, as this is one of the more popular ones from the house. 5/10.
* Eau de Memo: A tea fragrance that was pleasant to me because I like tea, but relatively forgettable, even with the iris in the middle. I also don't really like perfumes with a leather note. 4/10.
* Argentina: Rose and wood. Not my cup of tea or anything I gravitate toward, but it's okay. Would probably never wear this, but I know it'd smell good on someone else. 3/10.
* Ilha do Mel: I need to get my nose on this again. I remember liking it well enough in the store, but when I got home and saw the notes, it sounds like something I would go crazy for. Honey and iris??? Together?? How did I not remember this? In fairness though, this was the last fragrance I smelled at the counter and my nose was very fatigued and I hadn't done the coffee bean cleanse at all. 5/10 for now but WILL REVISIT!!!

**PENHALIGON'S**: I love how creative the bottles for this house are. Very whimsical and fun, and AFAIK this house is new to the Neiman I go to as well, so I was super excited to try. Walked away with several favorites on my mind!

* Luna: One of two that I knew about and went in wanting to smell. It's beautiful I fear, and I could look at that bottle ALL DAY. Does the scent justify the pricepoint? Maybe not. Does the bottle compensate? Yes. Beautiful clean, citrusy, feminine scent. 9/10.
* The Favorite: The other fragrance I knew about and went in wanting to smell. I knew I was going to love this, it's beautiful. Another absolutely ADORABLE bottle. Powdery, feminine, clean from the ambroxan. I wouldn't know which one to buy first between this and Luna. 9/10.
* Kiss of Bliss: Matcha so photorealistic, it's scary. I'm on the hunt for a good matcha perfume and this shot straight up to the top of the list. I make matcha lattes a lot at home, and I kid you not my brain could not process that I was smelling a perfume and not actually making a matcha latte. Absolutely insane experience, it smells beautiful, but it's incredibly photorealistic and I'm still deciding if I would actually want to smell like that regularly enough to warrant buying it. 11/10 so far though.
* Balm of Calm: Aromatherapy. It's nice, but not special by any means and definitely not worth that price tag. 5/10.
* Changing Constance: Beautifully done gourmand. I personally wouldn't buy it because I don't like the bottle enough to justify the price, and I'm not particularly blown away by the scent. But for all my vanilla/caramel babies, you will absolutely like this. The tobacco grounds it perfectly and keeps it from going into childish/not-worth-niche-price category. I imagine a fun, warm and friendly yet still incredibly classy woman wearing this. 7/10.

**DRIES VAN NOTEN**: I beelined to the display to smell Soie Malaquais, as it had been pretty hyped and I'd wanted to smell it for a while and no retailer I went to seemed to carry it! Until now! Other than Soie Malaquais, I wasn't particularly blown away by anything else I tried. See below.

* Soie Malaquais: The hype for this one is absolutely deserved. A citrusy vanilla is not a new concept by any means, and I am not usually impressed by them at all, but this one blew me away. I also don't typically like cacao in a fragrance, but it's incredible in this. There's not really much else to say about this fragrance other than that it's REALLY GOOD. 9/10.
* Camomile Satin: Lovely tea fragrance, but not special or memorable to me. 5/10.
* Santal Greenery: Really pretty, and the fig in here is exactly how I like my fig. However, it was just a little too woody for me (which isn't hard to do, so take that with a grain of salt), and I have a lot of other fig fragrances I prefer to this, so it's a pass. Plus, I don't really care for the bottle. 5/10.

**CHANEL**: Okay, I know this doesn't technically count as niche. BUT! According to the sales rep, my Neiman Marcus is one of 6 (7? I forgot) stores in the nation that sells Les Exclusifs de Chanel so maybe this makes the following fragrances half niche, idk.

* Beige: Pretty and classy, definitely has that chic Chanel vibe to it. Sweet floral, but not particularly memorable for me. 5/10.
* 1957: Very, very pretty. I don't know how they do it but Chanel could probably make a fart smell chic. It's literally just aldehyde iris and musk that pop out at me but it's still so GOOD. I will cherish the sample the sales rep gave me, but I wouldn't go looking for it after I finish it. It's def one of those ""Ooooh I know I really like that one but I'm never gonna buy it but I'll sniff it every time I see it"" fragrances for me. 7/10.
* Comete: I hate how much I love this. It's my purple floral dream. I really need to convince myself I don't like this as much as I do because that pricetag is absolutely ATROCIOUS. 10/10 sadly.",2,1738825761.0,FemFragLab,1,1.0,False

Sustainable Kitchen Products to Enhance Your California Home
------------------------------------------------------------

Living in California means embracing not only the beauty of the landscape but also a commitment to sustainability. This commitment extends into your kitchen, where choosing the right products can significantly impact the environment. Here are some sustainable kitchen products that can enhance your California home while helping you lead a greener lifestyle.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/california-home-goods-kitchen  
  
### Eco-Friendly Cookware

Opting for eco-friendly cookware is a great start. Look for alternatives made from materials like:

- **Cast Iron:** Durable and can last a lifetime when cared for properly.
- **Stainless Steel:** Recyclable and does not leach chemicals into food.
- **Ceramic:** Chemically-free and often made from naturally-sourced materials.

These types of cookware not only reduce the amount of harmful substances you introduce into your food but also stand the test of time, making them a wise investment.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/california-home-goods-kitchen  
  
### Biodegradable Utensils and Plates

For those who host parties often or enjoy outdoor dining, consider using biodegradable utensils and plates. Made from natural materials like bamboo or recycled paper, these products disappear back into the earth instead of adding to landfills. They offer convenience without compromising your commitment to sustainability.

### Reusable Food Storage Options

Say goodbye to single-use plastic bags and wraps! Instead, choose reusable food storage solutions. Here are a few options:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/california-home-goods-kitchen  
  
- **Beeswax Wraps:** An excellent substitute for plastic wrap, these wraps keep your food fresh and can be used multiple times.
- **Glass Containers:** Perfect for meal prep and storage, they are sustainable, dishwasher safe, and don‚Äôt stain.
- **Reusable Silicone Bags:** A versatile storage option suitable for freezing, microwaving, and marinating your favorite foods.

These products are not just eco-friendly; they also help keep your kitchen organized.

### Energy-Efficient Appliances

Investing in energy-efficient appliances is another way to create a sustainable kitchen. Look for appliances that have the Energy Star rating. This can include:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/california-home-goods-kitchen  
  
- **Dishwashers:** An energy-efficient model can save both water and electricity.
- **Ovens:** Convection ovens cook food more quickly and use less energy.
- **Refrigerators:** A well-rated fridge not only keeps your items fresh but also operates effectively.

Using these appliances helps minimize your environmental footprint and can save you money on utility bills over time.

### Compost Bins

A compost bin into your kitchen can significantly reduce your waste. Composting allows you to recycle kitchen scraps, such as:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/california-home-goods-kitchen  
  
- Fruit and vegetable peels
- Coffee grounds
- Eggshells

By turning these scraps into nutrient-rich soil, you can enhance your garden or potted plants while reducing what you send to the landfill. This not only makes gardening easier but also plays a role in reducing greenhouse gases.

### Natural Cleaning Supplies

Cleaning your kitchen shouldn‚Äôt come at the expense of the environment. Switch to natural cleaning supplies that are effective and safe for both your home and the planet. You can make your own cleaners using:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/california-home-goods-kitchen  
  
- **Vinegar:** A fantastic disinfectant.
- **Baking Soda:** Perfect for scrubbing various surfaces.
- **Castile Soap:** A gentle yet powerful cleaner for dishes and surfaces.

Not only are these options better for the environment, but they also avoid the harsh chemicals found in many conventional cleaning products.

By incorporating these sustainable kitchen products into your California home, you‚Äôre not just making eco-conscious choices; you‚Äôre also elevating your kitchen experience. From preparing meals to cleaning up, each decision counts towards a healthier planet. Embrace these products to help cultivate a sustainable lifestyle that‚Äôs beneficial for you, your home, and the Earth.

### Conclusion

By focusing on essential items like quality cookware, beautiful dishware, and versatile kitchen gadgets, you can elevate your culinary space while also showcasing your personal taste. Whether you're hosting dinner parties or enjoying a quiet meal at home, these essentials contribute to both the aesthetics and the efficiency of your kitchen.

1iiwn28,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1iiwn28/from_cutting_to_maintenance/,From cutting to maintenance,"This is going to be a long post, sorry in advance. 

Hello! I am a 22(f) years old woman who lost about 24kgs in a year (from 84kgs to 59 so far, my initial goal was 55 but I admit things are looking good already). My height is 163 cm. I feel like after a year of consistent dieting (I've been usually eating 1100-1200 cals a day, sometimes even less during the warmest months - I live in Italy, even breathing is exhausting in the summer - which I now realize it's probably not enough, but I sometimes struggle to eat more than 1300cals as I will later explain). I feel like my body and mind both need a small break before I progress with my body recomposition journey (I gotta build some lost muscle back and shed some leftover fat). I don't exercise heavy, but I make sure I hit 10-20k steps a day (on an average day 11-13k), by taking two long walks a day in between my studying sessions. I'll probably subscribe to a gym in February/March: I'm waiting to see if I'm supposed to move to a new city because of a job opportunity before I commit and spend god knows how much on a local membership I won't be able to use.

Calculating my TDEE is not easy at all. The number varies a lot depending on the amount of body fat % I supposedly have (from what I gathered it's pretty much impossible to know the exact %. I've always been on the softer side, and I do still have lots of arm and belly fat my body refuses to let go of, so I must assume it's still relatively high). Imagine I am built like the letter 'b', even at my lowest weight (now). No glutes all belly.

I tried calculating it by inserting various numbers ranging from 25 to 37% and on a worst case scenario my TDEE would be 1300! Will eating at a supposed ""maintenance"" cause a weight gain? I admit after losing this much the fear of gaining back is a tad overwhelming. Being a woman is though enough when weight fluctuates quite a lot due to your period ecc. Adding gained weight on top of the fake 'weight gain' we periodically experience would make me feel like I am failing big time. Still, I feel like nourishing my body better is more relevant than this, so it's something I'll do regardless of scale. 1400 cals seems like a good start.

But as I said, ever since I started my journey eating 1400 cals has become pretty though, I must admit. Even before that my daily cal intake wasn't too insane. I just don't eat pizza once a week anymore and I stopped eating sweet processed foods daily, by replacing them with fruit (which I adore wholeheartedly). Instead of having 100 grams of pasta I have the daily recommended dose (80-85gs). These are the type of changes I have been implementing.

Here's a breakdown of what I usually had this year to explain my dieting habits better:

BREAKFAST (07:00-10:00 AM, depending on when I wake up)> prior to my weightloss journey I used to ignore it. Now I obviously don't. I usually have these options:

-  a fruit (banana, apple, sometimes a mix of both, or other available fruits like a big pinapple bowl, watermelons, peaches, ANYTHING REALLY BECAUSE I GO INSANE FOR FRUITS!).

- yogurt (recent addition to my diet, usually fruit or coffee flavored, 125g). Used to avoid milk and similar foods because I was dealing with chronic diarrhea in the past. I now don't struggle with it anymore and these foods, eaten in moderation, don't seem to cause much harm anymore. 

- toasted bread with fruit jam (50g + 20g) 

- milk + sometimes toasted bread (the type it's supposed to be associated with milk, IDK the english word for it haha, 200ml-350ml + 40g)

AVG. BREAKFAST CALORIES: 100-250 cals

-----
LAUNCH/DINNER (12:00-13:00 / 18:00-19:00) options:

- risotto (85g + anything I want to have with it: broth, spinachs, pumpkin, mushrooms + sausages) / more rarely pasta, same condiments for it

- beans + cauliflower soup (sounds horrible tastes like heaven trust me, 240g + 200g)

- MEAT and VEGGIES: chicken or turkey breasts/hamburgers/sausages (100-150g), red meat as well (100-300g) to make sure my iron levels are okay, I try to have fish a couple of times a week as well (salmon 100g, swordfish 350g, normal fishes I forgot the names of 200-300g, seafood 100g, less frequently tuna 80-120g because I am not a huge fan of it). I usually pair it with green vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers ecc. 200-300g) or bread if needed (30-50g). Portions may vary depending on the combo, obviously. 

- OTHER: I have potatoes (100-200g raw) as a side dish a couple of times a week and I'm trying to eat more eggs (used to avoid them for previously stated reasons), so I often have 3 boiled/scrambled eggs either as a main course or as a side dish (in those occasions I reduce the portion to two).

IN SMALL PORTIONS ONLY A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK: cheese (parmiggiano not more than 17g, others 20g-40g depending on what I am cooking). I like it, but I don't necessarily need it. If I eat it, it's because I am craving it.

AVERAGE LUNCH/DINNER CALORIES: 350-500 cals, 

----
SNACK TIME (15:00-17:00): Usually fruit again, in smaller portions (100g-130g), more rarely something sweet (a slice of bread with nutella, a muffin, 4 biscuits).

AVG. CALORIES - 57-150 cals

I usually eat four times a day and combine these dishes depending on what I am craving. As I said I average between 1100 and 1200 cals (I calculate oils and sauces in these numbers, I don't often use them but when I do I count them). I do sometimes feel more hungry, and in those occasions I manage to reach 1300 cals, but if I try to go beyond that I feel like a stuffed turkey (MY FAMILY HAS A HISTORY OF GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES. I solved a 5 year long chronic diarrhea by implementing these changes into my diet and loosing weight. I honestly do not wish to feel sick anymore, but fixing my gut issues shouldn't lead to other health issues... I am so torn!!).

For example: my plan today was to have a 414cal breakfast, a 479 cal launch, a 104 cal snack and a ,440 cal dinner (1438 cal). I've had half of the breakfast calories (264: banana + slice of bread with nutella) and I feel stuffed already! I was supposed to add a yogurt, but I don't think I can handle it really! If I take the yogurt out I'm back at 1287 cals!

I probably understated, that but you get the point it's impossible.

  
Also thanks to (/u/beatadhd) for this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ioi1my/i_went_through_700_reddit_comments_and_collected/) that contains a lot of advice. A bit outdated and common/obvious advice though, if you're looking for that.

  
Here is a list of methods I found useful to stay somewhat focused. No typical advice like ""use pomodoro, remove your phone, cold shower"". I would appreciate if you could add on to it to, only uncommon advice.

* Brown / White Background Noise
* Gamify everything. Example: ""If I don't finish reading those 5 pages before coffee is done I am a pig""
* Chaos Study - Study many or all your subjects at once, whichever gives most interest in the moment and then swap to another as soon as you lose too much focus
* Muted Movie / Video / TV-Show infront of you
* Wear weird things when you study. For example: Fuzzy socks + blanket + a cap, or even a jacket.
* Random change of environment. Start studying at your desk, then at your bed, then on the floor, or kitchen. Go wild.
* 1.5 - 2.0x Speed on your video/audio with subtitles so you need to focus harder to comprehend.
* Roleplay as someone else. Maybe you are Keanu Reeves, or the top student in your class, be someone else in your mind.
* Overstimulation. Listen to music, podcast, white noise, nyan cat, whatever, just exaggerate your senses to the point where studying is the most peaceful thing you can do.
* Brainrot Text-to-speech of your studies with gameplay video in the background

1iiwjad,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1iiwjad/a_new_approach_to_weightloss_listing_everything_i/,A new approach to weightloss - listing everything I CAN'T commit to and unfollowing health influencers.,"25F - Height: 1.73m, SW:87kg, CW:85kg, GW:65kg. 

I have been overweight my entire life and have been yoyo dieting since I was 12. 

My entire adolescence and 20's were plagued by insecurity of my weight, judgement, diets, weightloss, weight gain, binges, restrictions, the whole lot. 

Naive and desperate, I fell ""victim"" to regular and contradicting dietary advice. If some shmuck on the internet said no fat, I'd say hell yes! If the second shmuck said high fat, my brain would go, ""How revolutionary! This would solve all my problems"".

Carbs were always the enemy, and because I managed to successfully lose a lot of weight by cutting carbs at least twice in my life, I saw this as the HOLY GRAIL. Conveniently forgetting about all the weight I gained back once I'd veer off the low carb lifestyle.  What I also conveniently decided to ignore, was the money I wasted on ""carb alternatives"" to desperately try and numb the cravings for some of the foods I love the most. Low carb breads, coconut-cauliflower pizza bases, shitaki noodles. I've tried every single carb alternative that is possibly out there. It was never the same. 

I had a bit of a revelation the other night where I realised that I DO NOT HAVE TO listen to all the dietary advice out there. I do not have to listen to my partner's mother's insanely restrictive dietary advice. I do not have to follow an animal-, plant-, sad-based lifestyle. I can do this sustainably, on my own terms, for my own lifestyle. So instead of making another long list of all the things I need to cut or drastically change, here's a list of things I can't commit to. And I will alter my CICO and exercise approach around this. 

(Please note that the list below is reflective of my personal choices. If you follow some of these commitments, I am in 0 way casting judgement. In fact, I applaud you for sticking with what works for YOU!)

Ok, here we go:

1: Cutting carbs entirely - I LOVE rice. Potatoes. Rye bread. They make me feel great. The more I cut, the more I binge. I don't need them with every meal, but once a day at least. 

2: Low fat this low fat that - I love butter. I don't need it in heaps. But I see no harm in portioning it to meet my CICO requirements. 

3: Desperately attempting to calorie-budget alcohol- This is a very personal once, but I have decided to cut out alcohol entirely. No matter how far in advance I'd try to plan my calorie intake around alcohol, I'd always over-drink and binge food on a hangover. And this is probably the most drastic adjustment I've made. You'll most likely see from my post history that this is something I've struggled with, but I am proud to say that I am 1 month and 6 days alcohol-free. (IWDWYT to the other subscribers who follow the same sub as I do. Iykyk x )

4: Exercises I don't enjoy - as a kid, I'd join these intensive exercise bootcamps in attempt to get fit. I HATED it. I generally do not enjoy any form of HIIT. What I DO enjoy is pilates, walking and running. I literally do not have to do anything else if it doesn't bring me joy. 

5: Influencer food - this is a weird one, but maybe you know what I'm talking about. Protein pancakes, almond milk lattes, Buddha bowls, gluten-free, fun-free etc. Generally these are time intensive and expensive. 

6: Desperately low calorie intake - this speaks for itself. 

7: Plant milk - Period. It's expensive and tastes like crap. I can opt for less whole milk or drink the occasional black coffee. 

8: Meal prepping - I really just don't enjoy it and so many fitness influencers encourage doing this. I have a grocery store close to me that I walk to nearly every day and buy my food fresh. I enjoy this, because it gives me a moment to disconnect from my computer and listen to some music on my earphones. 

What I CAN commit to is a balanced form of CICO, approaching weightloss slowly, whole foods and giving myself some grace. 

Life is difficult and we spend so much time judging ourselves on this journey, desperately looking to online health gurus for the ""answer"". 

We deserve to be healthy, on our own terms, with our own boundaries. We can adapt CICO and exercise to meet OUR needs, not someone else's. 

Thank you for reading, making this list felt very therapeutic and I encourage you to try it ‚ô°

My mother particularly likes to order 'teh o nipis, kosong' - which means tea pulled thinly, or less of the tea 'essence', no sugar (tying my best to explain here). For context, ' nipis' means 'thin' in Malay (the proper word is tipis). 

What's the saying if I want to order this in dialect? I know that 'gao' is thick, and there were some drink aunties that says 'teh o pok, kosong'. But when I say this phrase to another stall, most always screw up the order and make the tea too thick.

1iiwizf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Deep-Combination-434/comments/1iiwizf/broken/,Broken,"In a school somewhere in the English countryside, many boys were hitting a kid in a bed, that kid was me. I do not remember the beating I got. But the next day I barely was conscious and I was not able to move an inch. With marks of being tied up With tubes getting out of my mouth and having a breath controlled by a machine, I was more or less conscious.¬† I was laying there for weeks as I was being told at a later date. One day, I finally woke up and my auntie on my mother's side, was beside me, holding my hand and you could see her furious demeanour of the situation.

She had been there every day. I was floored by her statement and she continued by telling me that my parents had been there but when they saw me being hooked up to all the machines, they turned at the door and never came back.

Seemingly they didn't even bother to say hi to her or anything, it seemed from her perspective that they didn't want anything to do with her or me. And she continued telling you are going to hear some hard truths from the doctor. I'll let you hear what you need to hear from the doctor first. And then we'll talk.

The doctor was direct and forward, in the way that I was found in a dumpster and how I was tied up and all of that they couldn't save parts of me enough to still be a boy. Instead, they tried their best to save my life and decided to make me a girl just simply for the same reason and that I might be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life apart from moments of standing up maybe one step or 2 to my wheelchair.

You've been needing physical therapy for the rest of your life, the first few months are going to be intense but further down the line, you might just need less. There are some advantages right now that have come up some things in your brain that have heightened perception, hearing and we hope for your intelligence.¬†

We do hope that you choose a line of work that would correspond towards that.¬†

I wondered what they meant with that statement, then I said I would like to be a lawyer or something in the future. Something you could do from a wheelchair I thought.

My aunt Stacey came in through the door after the doctor had left, and she sat down on the stool near me. Now for the unfortunate truth. Your parents are guided by perfection, which comes to you at the moment since you were found broken you're not perfect in that sense.

So they opted to leave you behind in the hospital room hooked up to machines because I don't think you can make it and that could leave you behind. Legally you are mine to take care of and when I did so you were still a boy now and for all purposes and them, however, you are a girl with all that entails.¬†Have you figured out a name for yourself? Sarina!

As you grow up Sarina, you are going to get everything you need to be a girl and later a woman you going to be legally a woman and they are not going to understand what you are and when you feel prepared and when I have taught you everything I have to teach you, you can seek revenge if you want to at that time. I'm going to teach you how to and the times when you should not.

So I went to back school, an all-girl school closer to London. I came home to her estate where she lived a rather solitary life.¬†

They will know nothing from here on in. There were a few weeks left until the term of the school started.

And I got up to speed, thanks to her teachings, I however didn't know what to feel.

I learnt that she had paid the way for me before I got to school, this however well an old school for girls, I was enrolled and I was situated in the dorm room on level four. Thankfully there were a lot of elevators in the house. The next few years were great because I could be me in a new fashion, I was one of many who fitted it in I made a few friends, one of them was Robin. A vibrant bubbly girl, who wanted to be a politician. Her biggest flaw she was fiercely loyal and no nobody dared to implicate that I got into the school because of informative action and not by my score. I still sat in a wheelchair. That was the implication that tried to bestow on me. By now I could even walk for half a minute, just a few knew that.

But that had taken time and effort to get there.

I don't care about any of that; I proved I‚Äôm the best in class and still the shyest.

One day a few years later, I got in touch with a barrister. I wanted to go against my old school, kind of revenge maybe even hold them accountable for what had happened.¬†

It was an uphill battle, but this barrister her name was Layla also a vibrant girl. You could see an attraction between Layla and Robin still in infancy, but it was there.¬†

She said she wanted to depose me to make things right. Claims like these are never straightforward; they are always won on their own merits and sometimes by a few of the flews.

This is a unique case. The same school has done this. We can prove that similar things have happened and trace them back to the school. But we can't prove that it is the school; you will be the first to prove it.

Two weeks later, all the sessions had been done and we were set for the court.

The Empire who resided in the proceedings concluded that the school was liable and needed to acquiesce and pay for damages.

I kept pestering this barrister asking legal questions. Telling her that I wanted to be a lawyer like her. I also told her about all I knew about myself, and I also told her I wanted to hire her to get everything straight my ties to anyone, if I had any. Just got the money from the school, i.e. insurance money from the settlement. Was a lot of money for someone as young as me I just had to turn 18, still sitting in a wheelchair.

Then I asked how much they would like to have for part ownership in the law firm, and she asked how big a deal were thinking about 50%, I said. About 4 1/2 million pounds, she said.

Then you've got a deal I said you can have the money now or a bit later. I intend to make this the best law firm in the country. I'm not only going to be a normal lawyer. I'm going to be with the best lawyer that I have a lawyered.

So I got into college and went to the States. I got supported by my genius plan invested in something that I could build on when I was ready and had money during the time I was in school and had a place where I could hone my skills. And only a few knew who I was. This was by design because I did not want to be recognized by everyone, the obscurity cloak was the thing I sought after.¬†

I try to live within my means and by doing so I sort of amassed more capital. And very soon I just bought up the whole law firm and started on a new venture. I didn't know where my parents were so I had the law firm.

Investigate that line. I wanted to diversify into many things my idea was quite simply letting them work for themselves. Getting the profits and going on wasn't my style, I had a lot of time to think about how I wanted to do it and what I decided it was, I wanted to build an empire of sorts, me as a beneficiary so I needed any concern for myself.

I accrued a lot of businesses to my portfolio. The main ones were in banking, one in law, and a few in high-end restaurants. I made them handicap-friendly and laid down the law that if any of them were not nice to handicapped people, they had to deal with me and be fired. But the last bit I kept to myself.

I got to know where my parents were and they were back in England, London, and Islington. They lived in a three-story house, above a pub called Bishop Head.

My dad had a nice job, and so did my mother, they now had three kids three girls. I learnt that they have had a pretty ordinary life without me. However, I wanted to ensure they learned not to leave anybody behind.¬†

I sat outside the home and watched, and I wondered to myself if I was going to burn everything down. But if I'm going to let the kids have a good life despite their parents.

I went to the library because this was not an easy decision however one way or another these kids are going to feel the brunt of the force of the revenge. I did not really want that, but due to the mismanagement of me I could shield them from this, I will not even try. I wanted all of them to feel in their bones as I did.¬†

I went back to my car. Told the driver an older man drive me home. I let my emotions to feaster. And at that time, the driver, an old man with very sharp eyes, looked at me with genuine sympathy. The driver then said, the problem with family, they know exactly how to catch you down to size. Even if they don't know it. I lifted my head to the mirror and I said you on the half of it but you're right.

I've changed my mind. Let's go to the office.

When I came to the building where my office was. I wheeled in and went up, to the ninth floor.

I wanted to buy my father‚Äôs business‚Äôs he was a successful in running his business, which were automotive and repair shops.

He owned eight such business, all of them successful. So unbeknownst to him, I bought them through cooperate means to which I now owned. It took a few months for everything to take effect, and my father wrote a letter thanking me as the CEO without knowing my name. He was now surrounded, just where I wanted him to be.

The stage was set, the attack was imminent and I want to give him one more chance to see if he could be empathic to someone. I knew he took his coffee so I came to the store one day and I took the table he usually took. And he came to have his coffee and saw that I had taken his place so it came forward and said to me, please this is a nice place but it says mine. And I looked into his eyes and said I did not see your name anywhere here and this is as much my place as it is yours you're welcome to share it if you like. But please do not have that tone towards me. I said, I‚Äôm not your employe, I am just a girl here for coffee.

He stood there for a second totally surprised, then he said that handicapped people like me should just stay home and just be of service to normals like him because they have no place in society.

Att that moment felt I anger but I swallowed that insult. I called for my service said to him, hate like that must be personal and will someday come bite you.¬†

He turned on his heel, and said this will not be the last time we meet and I should be aware of who he is and he will destroy me. But I bet him to it, so I called my lawyer to write a letter but remind him that his owner didn't think it was a very good idea that he was going after this little, because he has been ranting all over the show about it.

Then he contacted the law firm which the letter came from, and said he wanted to talk to owner. The lawyer gave him a call, and said by all means and I suggest you bring the lawyer. My lawyer put the phone down, and said that he had found some discrepancies both in his account and his business. They were not going as well as they were portrayed. The reasons he had to be obscure all was simple and deceitful, because everything was tied to his gambling debts, so he had built an empire so nothing could actually touch him, well that was idea.

The next day we came to his office, him not realizing I owned them already, I had made up my mind. It's gonna make abundantly clear that anything I said will come to affect at that time I said it. He done this to stay afloat. But we knew he was almost going into forfeiture, and that was with in a month, my idea was going to be buy the company and sell it for spare parts, which was the only way to make profit.

So I was wheeled into the office, and the face he was making when he saw me was all worth it. And I said ‚ÄùHi my name is Sarina‚Äù. But you know me as Coffee girl. But I knew you as Dad. But you left me alone and broken in a hospital without a second thought. Though I was born as Erik, you made it clear that you don‚Äôt care about anybody but yourself. I'm here to buy you out, which I've already done and then I'm going to throw you out of your house with mum so you can live on the streets. Without any money to your name. That's what I'm here for the only people I'm going to make to go to school and have a reasonable life as your daughters. They are innocent but you're not so let's get this show on road.

For the next hours, I did what I came to do. It was three weeks they were thrown out to the street without a penny to the name.

No, there were no satisfaction for me to do this, but I needed to do it to prove a point. The same point they did outside the hospital.

1iiwidq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MICHUPETUS/comments/1iiwidq/why_is_my_cat_shedding_so_much/,Why Is My Cat Shedding So Much?,"If you're a cat owner, you‚Äôve probably come to accept the fact that cat hair will always be a part of your life. On your clothes, on your furniture, in your coffee (bonus fiber, right?). But what if your feline friend is shedding more than usual? Should you be worried? Let‚Äôs break it down.

# Why Is My Cat Losing So Much Fur?

First off, some shedding is normal. Cats naturally groom themselves and shed hair to maintain a healthy coat. However, excessive shedding or bald patches? That‚Äôs when you might want to investigate further. Here are some possible reasons:

# 1. Seasonal Shedding

Cats don‚Äôt exactly check the calendar, but their fur knows when the seasons change. Many cats shed more in the spring and fall as they adjust their coats. If your cat is otherwise healthy, this could just be their version of a wardrobe change.

# 2. Stress (Yep, Cats Get Stressed Too)

Cats are creatures of habit. If you've moved to a new place, introduced a new pet, or even just rearranged the furniture, your cat might be feeling stressed. Overgrooming as a stress response can lead to bald spots, particularly on their belly, inner thighs, or legs.

# 3. Parasites ‚Äì The Uninvited Guests

Fleas, mites, and ringworm (which, fun fact, is actually a fungus, not a worm) can make your cat itchy, leading to excessive scratching and hair loss. If you notice scabbing, redness, or excessive licking, a trip to the vet is a must.

# 4. Allergies ‚Äì Not Just a Human Problem

Just like humans, cats can have allergies too! Whether it's food, pollen, or even the new detergent you‚Äôre using on their favorite blanket, allergies can cause itchiness and excessive shedding. Your vet can help identify the culprit.

# 5. Underlying Health Issues

Conditions like hyperthyroidism, skin infections, and even diabetes can sometimes cause hair loss. If shedding is accompanied by weight loss, excessive thirst, or behavioral changes, it's time for a vet visit.

# How Can I Reduce My Cat‚Äôs Shedding?

If you‚Äôre finding more cat hair on your couch than on your cat, here are some solutions to keep both your home and your feline looking their best:

# 1. Brushing Is Your Best Friend

Regular brushing not only helps remove loose fur before it lands on your furniture, but it also prevents your cat from swallowing too much hair (hello, hairballs). Long-haired cats benefit from daily brushing, while short-haired cats do well with a few sessions a week.

# 2. A Balanced Diet Makes a Difference

A healthy coat starts from within! High-quality cat food with plenty of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids can keep your cat‚Äôs fur shiny and reduce excessive shedding. If needed, your vet might recommend supplements.

# 3. Keep the Stress Levels Down

If stress seems to be the culprit, consider using calming aids like pheromone diffusers, giving your cat more hiding spots, or simply maintaining a predictable routine. Happy cat = healthy coat.

# 4. Check for Parasites Regularly

Even indoor cats aren‚Äôt immune to fleas. Use a flea comb, keep up with preventative treatments, and make sure your cat‚Äôs living environment is clean.

# 5. Consider the Right Type of Litter (Yes, Really!)

Believe it or not, the type of litter you use can also impact your cat‚Äôs skin health. Some litters contain artificial fragrances and chemicals that can irritate sensitive cats, leading to excessive grooming and shedding. [Michu‚Äôs Wonder Cat Litter ](https://michupet.com/products/michu-automatic-box-wonder-litter)and[ Mixed Tofu Cat Litter ](https://michupet.com/products/mixed-tofu-cat-litter)are great choices, as they‚Äôre gentle on paws, dust-free, and great for odor control.

# Final Thoughts: When to See the Vet

If your cat‚Äôs shedding seems excessive, comes with bald spots, red or inflamed skin, or other unusual symptoms, don‚Äôt wait‚Äîsee a vet. Catching any potential health issues early can save you and your kitty a lot of trouble (and vet bills) down the road.

At the end of the day, shedding is just part of the feline package. But with a little extra care, you can keep both your cat and your home looking their best‚Äîless fur on your clothes, and more on your cat, where it belongs!

While I tried to provide and support her, she rarely contributed financially or emotionally. Friends suggest it might be due to cultural differences, but I'm seeking feedback on whether this dynamic was inherently problematic or just a mismatch. Any insights would be appreciated!

Both of us do well financially in tech

She: Single mother 3 kids. A few marriages in her past. Bad ones.

ME: Single professional, never married, no kids

**Financially:** I provided, paid for all outings, coffee, drinks, dinner, etc. She never contributed to anything financially but would not hesitate to run up tabs with drinks, usually 2-4 drinks at dinner. Never once offered to buy or pitch in. I understand the dynamic of a man being a provider but she didn't want to do anything in return, really. She said no to laundry. But she did make the bed and that was her gesture as she put it. Other than that, nada.

However, she spent lavishly on herself. Shopping sprees, massages, pedicures, etc.

**Romantic gestures:** Aside from her giving me a card once, the romantic gestures were all from me. Flowers by her bedside, date nights closer to her home and out of my way so she have a shorter drive in the dark due to her bad eyesight, specialty pillow for her bad back for when she slept over, etc, etc. She did tell me at dinner those weren't love languages, they were just ""doing something for someone"". I disagree completely. That felt offensive to me. She said love languages is what she brought to the table such as making me feel ""Seen and heard"".

I also pretty much planned every date, always hosted and entertained. Not much on her end other than taking me to a park once where she got my car towed. Again, didn't ask her to pay for it. Took care of it myself.

**Support:** When she was down, I was there for there. Supported her, encouraged her. I was only visibly upset with her once, when I came to bed one night and she noticed but didn't bother to ask.

**Intimacy:** I'm very affectionate. She said she wasn't. Not even with her children. Cuddling was out of the question. Bummer. Although bedroom fun was great. But as I mentioned in a previous thread, she failed to disclose her STD until after we were intimate, twice. Her defense was she didn't think things would go that far. Note it wasn't fully intimacy, but 50% for sure.

I would like opinions if this sounds like a one sided dynamic (which I believe strongly that it is) or am I not understanding a proper provider role or cultural differences? Relationships are meant to be mutually beneficial to a certain degree imo. But as I mentioned before, the feedback from folks I know is mixed, with some blaming me.

Things did end however, when my card declined at dinner the other night due to a mishap. As I stepped away to resolve the issue she apparently paid the bill, left and never spoke to me again, ending things abruptly. I'm not trying to gather comments for harping on her but rather to get more feedback on whether or not this can be summed up to cultural differences, etc or just a selfish partner. We were supposed to be discussing my unhappiness about these things at dinner that night but before I get my full thoughts out, the card decline occurred and she left.

I sent her a text asking where she was with no reply after she left. Followed by a stern text demanding an apology after she left or things weren't going to work. She obviously made her decision.

Thanks in advance for the feedback!",2,1738824042.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

She is sweet, a strong solo mother and has countless intellectual and emotional qualities. I approached her without any intention, just for friendship, since we work together. However, she has a little daughter who is between 3 and 4 years old.
I have proposed to help her since we are both unemployed and have time on our hands.
Yesterday and today, I helped clean her house, made us lunch and helped pick her daughter up from school. I organized the little girl's entire room, folded her clothes, washed the bathroom, sofa and living room... I did this because I like to help when I have time. It's my language of affection. Today, after cleaning the house, we sat down to eat together and have a beer, just us, listening to music.
Tomorrow, she asked me to braid her hair. She is super open to friendships. I accepted the job because I need a portfolio as a trancista, I'm not going to charge for labor. Arriving home I realized that I was feeling something else. Whether I felt it or not, I would have helped equally, because I really believe in empowering women. However, I wonder if I should braid her tomorrow and at the end, ask if she would like to have an afternoon with cupcakes and coffee, like a date. She is bisexual. Should I invite? And to say that in addition to a nice friendship, I felt something different? My fear is that I got emotional for a second. I'm super capable of letting that go easily. But I thought the exchange was cool. The crazy thing is that she usually receives a lot of visitors and her daughter has affectionate uncles and aunts.

So, I am on my second week of doing it this time around. One thing that this time, almost from the beginning, is significantly different is that I am experiencing a lot of skipped heartbeats, which I thought was strange. After a while I noticed it is very much acid reflux, especially if I go with a very fatty meal. It is so uncomfortable that I was about to terminate the diet, in spite of all its benefits (mental clarity and wight loss). 

However, today, I noticed that the skipped beats and reflux came right after drinking coffee (which I always take it black) in the morning. Is there anyone else who share the same experience with me? Is there any suggestion how to deal with it? Of course, quitting coffee is an option but that has proven to be a 2-3 week project for me in the past that I cannot afford to do it now. Does anyone here use caffeine pills? Any thoughts on them?

So I‚Äôm writing my own. As an ultra-MAGA, America First, Trump-supporting, nationalist, populist. 

Dear liberals,

We don‚Äôt hate you. In fact, we admire you. Your grip on culture, your cosmopolitanism, your prioritization of education and concern for vulnerable groups. I could go on. (Plus, have you ever seen a coffee shop run by conservatives? It‚Äôs frightening. We need progressives for your coffee culture alone!)

So, we don‚Äôt hate you. We just think you‚Äôre wrong. About nearly everything. 

We also see how the left has changed. In our opinion, radically. Some points to consider: 

-We think that you were the ones who were pro free speech, and we admired that, but we don‚Äôt think you hold those same values anymore. In fact, we find that you‚Äôre eager to shut down debate and legitimate criticism in an alarming way. 

-We think that you were the ones who were skeptical of the intelligence agencies and their influence on American society. When George Bush lied us into Iraq in 2003, you were rightly outraged. Now, we are concerned to see a wholehearted embrace of the FBI/CIA/NSA etc that you were once correct to be wary of. 

-Finally, we recognize that you were once the voice of the working class, not the educated coastal elites. The Dem party was the inclusive party, welcoming everyone with different thoughts and ideas. We don‚Äôt see that now, and we see evidence in the data from the most recent election alone of a shift away from a multi-racial working class from your party into ours, the GOP. 

We think that what President Trump and his team are doing right now is a course correct that is sorely needed for our government. We aren‚Äôt supportive of this out of spite or malice, but rather, we are motivated to make this country as great as we can be. 

As President Obama once said, there is not a red America and a blue America ‚Äî there is the United States of America. 

So, we love you, liberals. We know you‚Äôre hurting because you lost this election. And we hope you do some reflecting on it. We need you. We need unity and optimism in this country. 

And hey, we need your coffee shops because, well, conservatives can do a lot but we can‚Äôt make coffee. Good luck out there, my patriotic liberal and progressive friends. ‚ù§Ô∏è",0,1738823901.0,OptimistsUnite,22,0.14,False

Hey fragrance fanatics!

I'm having a serious problem. I LOVE trying new perfumes, but it feels like my nose goes on strike after just a few sniffs. I get completely nose-blind, and then I'm left clueless about the perfume's actual performance. I can't tell if it projects, if it leaves a trail, or if it lasts longer than my morning coffee.

So, I'm begging for your expertise! How do YOU properly test a perfume to get a real sense of its projection, sillage, and longevity?

Here are some specific questions I have:

\*Nose Blindness: How do you combat this? Are there any tricks to ""reset"" your olfactory senses between sniffs? I've heard about coffee beans, but do they actually work?

\*Projection: What's the best way to gauge how far a perfume projects? Do you have any specific testing methods?

\*Sillage: How do you determine the sillage (the trail a perfume leaves behind)? Do you ask someone to follow you around? (awkward!)

\*Longevity: Any tips for figuring out how long a perfume lasts on your skin? Do you spray it on different parts of your body?

I'm really eager to learn the proper way to evaluate a perfume.

Please share your wisdom and help a perfume newbie out! Any tips, tricks, or personal experiences are welcome.

Thanks in advance!

1iiwbi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iiwbi6/aita_for_getting_out_of_my_lane_with_a_marine/,AITA for getting out of my lane with a Marine?,"Several years ago, my dad, a retired Marine, passed away unexpectedly. As a result, my sister and I ended up doing most of the work to make arrangements for a memorial service and take care of things like changing services over to my Mom's name.

He had kept up with a lot of Marines via mail and email, being in the USMC for 30 years. However, he'd also lost contact with a lot of people I remember from my childhood as a result of the passage of time. During my bereavement leave from work, I spent a lot of time looking up his old friends through social media and various other sites, and actually managed to locate just about everyone I could remember - people I hadn't even thought of in over 30 years.

As I started to reach out to people, they were pleased to hear from me until they realized why I was reaching out - and several guessed from voicemails or emails, given the age. So many people were so wonderful and gracious, that process really helped me deal with my dad's passing.

However, I also discovered that some of his old friends didn't know he was friends with other people they strongly disliked. I also ran into situations where some people asked for money or were really very awkward, which I just left alone.

I guess this entire process put me into a certain mindset where I ended up writing overly detailed emails to people, and got back too much in return. Without any sort of prompt, I got a LOT of political discourse out of the blue, which I just ignored. I also got phone calls from sad older folks who wanted to talk about past good times, which I was more than happy to do, even when they called several times - because I really empathized with their sadness.

In one case, one old friend (we'll call him Mr. Brown) in particular advised me that a lot of bad actors would come out of the woodwork. I did ask if he'd like the contact information of an old colleague to catch up - we'll call him Mr. Blue. Mr. Brown was someone I remembered very well, as his girlfriend babysat me when I was younger, and I often did little chores for him for money, and we used his pool. But Mr. Brown was also one of those people who went on a political diatribe a few minutes after learning of my dad's passing over the phone. I had talked to Mr. Blue before Mr. Brown, and Mr. Blue asked me to share his contact info with any other Marines from the same unit, of which Mr. Brown was also a member. When I shared this, Mr. Brown's response was: ""Mr. Blue is not a friend of mine nor was my tour shared with him something I recall as particularly positive.¬† I don‚Äôt recall any comm with him since he departed the unit."" In response, I shared what I thought was a carefully and thoughtfully-worded email suggesting they could get a beer to mend things, as my dad's greatest regret in life (which he'd mentioned several times in years leading up to his passing) was how everyone seemed to hold grudges.

Mr. Brown's response: I was not in need of a reply and I‚Äôm not sure why we need to continue to discuss or make an issue with my opinions of former Marines and/or grudges, as you put it.¬†I would not use the word, grudge, but that does not mean I need to reach out and send an email either to former officers I worked with because we have a mutual friend. ¬†I would have a cup of coffee/beer with anyone I ever served with, quite frankly.¬†To be blunt, I and any other Marine or probably most service members had positive and not-so positive memories of fellow comrades and experiences. I should not have to feel compelled or justified to provide facts/incidents to you regarding who I stay in touch with or why‚Ä¶..The military is full of drama sometimes (sometimes ugly, sometimes people even get kicked out‚Ä¶even in our former unit) as any organization deals with when dealing with people.¬†Mr. Green, for example, is another individual I would not go out of my way either but that does not mean I would not work with both officers just as hard as any other officer to complete the mission.¬† If anyone walks around thinking the Marine Corps is a big love fest they are a bit na√Øve with reality.¬†We all strive to get the mission completed, train, and lead in the most professional way we know. Respectfully, I think you‚Äôre getting a bit out of your swim lane implying I should mend up any bridges with former officers.¬†Frankly, I was not under the impression I had any bridges to mend.¬† This does not necessarily mean I need to start emailing them either.¬† I‚Äôm confident you not aware of the history of some of the happenings in the unit (some prior to your father‚Äôs tour since I was there prior to his arrival) and I‚Äôm professional enough not to share some of the history. Lets put this to bed‚Ä¶.These exchanges have already brought up some foul memories of some personnel that embarrassed the maint dept as well as the Marine Corps.

After that, Mr. Brown asked me in a follow-up email to stop emailing him, and he let me know he would not attend any services. He had mailed my mom some gifts, but after that, he was gone.

I \*had\* felt somewhat rewarded by reaching so many of my dad's friends and colleagues, but this hurt me for a while, and I didn't realize I'd crossed a line. I also had one other experience where I didn't really hear back after an initial phone call talking about mutual acquaintances that were a surprise, where I got the impression that my dad had spent a long time carefully juggling friendships.

When I really became conscious, it was at my uncle's house. My sister and I don't have a good relationship. Ever since I was little, my mother would baby my sister and always have an excuse for the way she was acting. The (she's autistic) was always it. Sometimes I just know when my sister fakes things. One time when I was 12-13 years old, we were sitting in our shared room, and she randomly grabbed my sister's bag of spicy chips and ate some, which confused the hell out of me.She NEVER eats spicy foods, NEVER. And of course nobody believed me. Because yeah, she never ate spicy food. Another time she was getting into my mom's new coffee creamer, so I snitched. (because I hate her, of course), and she switched it out for a half-empty one. When my mom finally said she acted all shy and said, ""See, Mom. I wasn't using the new one; I'm using the half-empty one."" And my mom just told her to ask next time.I ratted her out, OFC, and she threw a fit. Started yelling  and ran upstairs and then my mom said "" now look at what you did, you hurt her feelings"" which made me even madder....and through out the years she would steal many things. Even from me. And lie straight to my mom's face, and every time I confronted her, she screamed and threw a fit. Our neighbor doesn't think she has autism. And I probably sound stupid for saying this, but I feel like she grew out of it. But she continuously does these stupid things just to have all the attention. There was this one time I was trying to show my mom a necklace I made. My first one. And she walked into the bathroom and said, ""Mom, I need help turning on the shower."".  Bullshit.

It's pretty obvious who takes shit. There are so many times I want to call my mother stupid for not noticing. Too many times She's not a little, helpless baby. She's literally 17. She can do stuff on her own. My sister purposely stresses my mother out so she can get what she wants, and it doesn't help that my mother gets overwhelmed too fast. I stay in my room besides getting food and using the bathroom and showering. I never leave it. I can't even joke with my sister. She gets so offended, and I swear she does it purposely to start shit.

1iiw3pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iiw3pg/shopping_for_1st_machine_700/,Shopping for 1st machine [$700],"Hello everyone,

I am looking at getting my first machine. I have been looking at refurb GCP evo from Wholelattelove and the Gaggiuino mod. After a month of looking at the github, and trying to find a build guide that is more user friendly, I am pretty sure I wont be able to confidently do the mod and fear it would sit around or I'd wreck the machine or mod or both. I planned on already spending around $700 total on the GCPE $350 and the Gaggiuino mod $300 and any additional things I would need to install it, call it another $50-$100.

Currently my set up is a cheap Hamilton Beach gooseneck kettle without temp control (that I citric acid descale once a month), a plastic v60 (that is 5 years old and in need of replacing) and a Baratza encore (that I got refurbished from them in 2020) and swapped to virtuoso burrs. I am subscribed to Bottomless so I get fresh roasted coffee frequently based on my algorithm. I love Peixoto Honey I get from them more than others.

This setup has done me well for everyday coffee, but its time for a change.

That being the case....

I am looking for recommendations on espresso machines. In that price range that will need little to no mods. I will be using double filtered tap water (fridge filters and then into a brita) my city water is quite hard. When I go to a coffee shop, I generally drink lattes, and my partner likes a caramel macchiato. Do I ""need"" latte art.... no but it would be fun to learn.

I would prefer to stay in the 58mm group range because accessories for the 54mm for Bambino Plus or 57mm for the Lelit Anna are hard to find reasonably priced.

If you all think I should go with the GCPE and just temp surf I am ok with that it will allow me to speed the extra $400 on a mii coffee DF54 or DF64v2.  
I am also open to manual level machines like the Flair 58.

Eventually I would like to save the $3k and get a Lelit Bianca or a even a $6k La Marzocco Linea Mini

I hope others benefit from it. Feel free to contribute in this thread for others if you have useful things to add!

Self work :  
\- Breathwork : I like Othership, iOS/Android. Or free on youtube [https://www.youtube.com/@Othership/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Othership/videos)  
\- Meditation : I like ""The Way"" on Android/iOS. Calm app is also nice but ""too much choice"" for me  
\- Basic breathing techniques : close eyes and do Box Breathing, 4-7-8  
\- Cold showers / cold water (whether pool, a lake, your bathtub, sink)  
\- Sauna (if you can tolerate it), combines well with cold water after

Supplements : Please note - to maintain effectiveness you must take a week break after eg. 3-4 weeks  
\- Valerian  
\- Lemon balm  
\- Ashwaganda  
\- L-theanine  
\- Brahmi  
\- Herbal teas (chamomile, linden, peppermint, sleep blends (usually have valerian)

Reducing stimulation :  
\- No Caffeine/stimulants.  
I left the love of my life, coffee. I miss it. But I think it may be for the best, for now  
\- Limit any/all screen time.  
No scrolling my phone. No reading news. Very limited social media. Deliberate use of technology only  
\- If I do watch video/tv I make sure its A) timeboxed B) something relaxing. No action movies, drama, no jumpcut youtube videos. Calming, slow paced stuff only.  
\-Stario Launcher on Android. There's also minimalist launcher.  
This helps to reduce the temptation to use random apps, check stuff, etc.  
\- Close your eyes. On really rough days, maybe its 20 minutes every hour. It helps, lame as it is. 

Nature :  
If you have nature easily accessible, and decent weather : just going there to sit and observe nature, people. This can be great. Stay out of your mind, enjoy the scenery.

Particularly I want to share breathwork. I struggled with meditation because of the mental focus and effort it requires - breathwork comes more easy to me. That said, I have persisted with meditation now and I've managed to make it a daily habit. I feel now after more than 2 months, its starting to bear more fruit.",7,1738822489.0,cfs,0,1.0,False
