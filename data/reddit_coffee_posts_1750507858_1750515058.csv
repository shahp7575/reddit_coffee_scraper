1lgxchm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lgxchm/ghosted_after_5_dates_two_weeks/,Ghosted after 5 dates (two weeks),"Took a girl out on 5 different dates. First was a coffee shop, second was movie, third, walking at the park with her dog. Began picking her up on date 4-5, where we went to a soccer game and brunch the next day.

We shared a lot in common, it felt pretty good. I was my genuine self and it felt like she was too. I don’t recall saying anything that would put somebody off, I think I was a gentleman through and through.

She wanted to go to an event on July 4th so I bought us tickets (around date 4) and we planned to go to it.

On date 5 she made out with me and told me she liked me, I said I really liked her too. She said she thought I was nervous around her but I didn’t feel like I was, but suggested maybe it’s because this is something new.

Last week she has a surgery come up with her dog and wont let me pick her up for her date, wants to be “in and out of the restaurant”. Won’t let me bring food back to her place instead. It felt like she simply wanted a meal or to friendzone me and leave. So I cancelled and asked her to hit me up when she was free.

I follow up after i cancelled and said I was getting mixed signals. She said sorry and said she had a lot come up this week.

I follow up the next day and ask if we should cancel July 4th, and ask if she is interested in me still (out of transparency, the energy felt off this week). And she ghosts me. I double text with an inside joke about 12 hours later closing the loop and nothing, so I drop it.

What could I do better? Perhaps I assumed the worst, when she could have actually been busy? Or perhaps with another person/ex boyfriend.",1,1750514721.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I literally started working here 2 weeks ago and tomorrow is about to be my 3rd shift. Mind you I’m 17 and this is my 2nd job. It’s a cafe and I wasn’t properly trained and the owner just made me watch him take an order once before he left me to fend for myself. His son tried teaching me some stuff but it was obvious he had no clue on how to train

i’ve only had one job before at Mcdonald’s and i quit that over a year ago so i literally can’t remember anything 

last sunday was my 2nd shift and in my opinion, without much training i was doing pretty well. but according to the owner i was lazy and useless, and he said if i didn’t wanna work he doesn’t need me, and he said he doesn’t wanna be babysitting me.

first of all, im sorry but isn’t your whole job to babysit a trainee at least for once? also the chefs hate me and they’re so rude to me for some fuck ass reason but everyone else working there is nice to me

i have to go back tmr but i really don’t want to cus the man’s gonna yell at me again for forgetting to put a spoon next to the coffee or smth dumb like that

and to add onto that last time i went it he acted like he didn’t know i was meant to be there and he was asking me if i have anything better to do so im scared he’ll forget i’m meant to be there again

how can i redeem myself and make him not yell at me? i’ve been trying to do everything that i can and take initiative, ask if anyone needs help but apparently im still doing it wrong ",2,1750514625.0,jobs,1,1.0,False

1lgxa9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1lgxa9u/looking_for_insight_struggling_to_process_the_end/,Looking for insight: struggling to process the end of a friendship,"Hi Reddit,

I’m (32F) struggling to process the end of a ten-year friendship with ""AJ"" (36F). We met in a language class and grew close, sharing long talks, coffee dates and nights out dancing. Over the years, I supported AJ through her recovery from an ab\*sive relationship.

Three years after her breakup, her ex contacted her, threatening self-harm after becoming homeless. She let him move in “for two weeks,” but he stayed for eight months without paying rent. During this time, AJ stopped investing in our friendship. She ignored my calls, never asked about my studies and would only talk about her dynamic with her ex.

While I initially sympathised, AJ's behaviour became increasingly problematic. She’d threaten, scream at, and manipulate her ex - once, she even initiated a physical altercation. The breaking point came when she asked me to involve my partner and job (I work part-time in law enforcement) to intimidate her ex: not to resolve anything, but to assert power over him, to ""show him"" that she ""could.""

I told her no. I expressed concern about her behaviour and the growing emotional distance between us. I also asked her to respect my boundaries, including not showing up at my workplace, but she ignored these requests. This was the last straw. I ended the friendship in February 2025. AJ sent, then “unsent,” a message. We have not spoken since.

Now I feel sad, angry and confused. I miss our long talks and shared curiosity about the world, but I couldn’t tolerate her actions. I struggle to meet new people with the same qualities I admired in AJ and would love advice, or suggestion for resources that I could turn to, from anyone who has experienced the pain of losing a close friend.

**TL;DR:** My 10-year friendship ended after my friend let her ex move in, became toxic toward him, and asked me to use my partner and job (law enforcement) to intimidate him. Friend ignored my boundaries and distanced herself emotionally, so I ended things.",1,1750514552.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I initially wanted to go with M3/M4 Pro (14"") since I usually on a maximalist side that always thinks ""I might need this"" and in reality, I'll not even maximize it or even use it but when I went to an Apple shop, I like the weight of the M3/M4 Air (13""). Also, I was planning to refresh my Mac Mini M1 (16GB + 512GB) when M5 or M6 comes out, so I in the future if I need to perform heavy stuff then I'll do it on Mac Mini instead.

I'll get an M3/M4 and 16GB/512GB unit and my use cases will be mostly for productivity, photo editing (Adobe Lightroom) which I don't do heavy editing and it'll be lighter now as I shoot with Fujifilm (SOOC via Custom Recipe) now so it will be more on minor adjustment now, light video editing (I never actually done this much for years/decade now) and with a minor adjustment/grading only since I'll be also using a recipe too and mostly for browsing or productivity (which will be the most likely usage as we'll be needing it in our operating a small coffee shop).

I know with my reasons above the answer is Air (13"") but I'm just wondering which part of it I'll probably regret? I know I won't except on the screen is too small? 13"" vs 14"" (Pro) or 15"" (Air). Or maybe when it comes to longevity since the Air doesn't have the cooling like with the Pro which I'm not sure if it'll be a little bit of consideration since I'm living in SEA country, but I usually use a laptop in an air conditioned environment.

I’ve been pouring my heart into a dream over the past year building something gentle, meaningful, and rare: intimate retreats for women, designed to help us reconnect, breathe, and feel truly seen.

After nearly 8 years in luxury hospitality in the South of France, I left everything to launch **Solar Circle** : a series of soulful, slow-living retreats hosted in breathtaking locations (an authentic villa in Marrakech, a cocooning chalet in the French Alps, a bastide in Provence...).

It’s not just about travel. It’s about sisterhood. About creating spaces where women can feel safe, inspired, and alive again.

The first retreat happened this April in Morocco. I gave it everything: time, money, energy, soul. The next one, in September, is a press retreat to introduce Solar Circle to a wider audience. I found a magical bastide, once owned by French writer Henri Troyat, and planned a 3-day experience for a handful of incredible women, inspiring content creators who collectively reach over 500,000 people.

It’s a big step for Solar Circle, and a powerful way to finally share this project with the world without a big marketing budget. We already have the support of amazing brands : Champagne Drappier, CoveSkin, L’Atelier C Valbonne, JOA Drinks but only through gifting.

Right now, I’ve hit a wall financially. My personal savings are depleted. And I’m still pushing forward alone.

I’m not giving up. I just need a bit of support to make this next chapter happen.

If this resonates with you, if you believe the world needs more spaces like this for women, I’d be deeply grateful if you’d consider helping through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/solarcircle). Even the smallest donation helps cover groceries, transportation, or meaningful touches for the retreat.

Or just leave a kind word if you’ve ever been through this phase — that means a lot too 💛

Thanks for reading. From one woman chasing light to another : thank you.

With love,  
Sarah

I was bored of them so to train for my first marathon i built an app that made running fun and helps you to stay consistent - like Duolingo + Forest for running,"Hi people,

I have been running for more than 5 years now and this year I decided to train for my first marathon. But all the apps out there are basically just trackers or social media apps and there was nothing much to keep me consistent there.

So as a developer, I thought of building a tiny app that rewards you with cute plants and trees for your runs and you grow your garden. You keep your streaks and grow your garden

I recently introduced an Apple Fitness sync feature (in beta) with the help of which you can get all your runs from Apple Watch (Apple Fitness app, Garmin or Strava) to the app.

The app is currently being used by 300 runners and the feedback has been super positive. 

App is available for  free trial and $4.59 per week (less than a cup of coffee for your better health and consistency)  so feel free to check it out and see if it helps you too.

Man caught on camera smashing door of downtown Charlottesville Mudhouse


Joana Suleiman


The Daily Progress

6/18/25 8:00 AM


Things were so bad at Mudhouse Specialty Coffee Roasters in downtown Charlottesville Tuesday morning that one employee thought they might be the victim of a practical joke.


When employees arrived at the Downtown Mall location of the popular cafe chain around 6:30 AM, not only was the power out but the glass of the front door had been shattered.


""Nobody knew this had happened until about 6:30 a.m. when the staff came in and saw the damage,"" Mudhouse manager Joshua Young told The Daily Progress. ""We also had a power outage that affected the whole block due to a downed tree. So our team walked in and we have no power and a broken door. Our worker Sarah thought she was walking into a prank show. This has been a very chaotic morning for us.""


[an image of a red door with a large window where the glass has been replaced with plywood a white paper sign reading “OPEN” has been taped to the plywood]


Image caption: 


“Cal Tobias, The Daily  Progress


Plywood covers the front door to Mudhouse Specialty Coffee Roasters on Charlottesville's Downtown Mall, Tuesday, June 17, 2025, after it was smashed in the previous night.”


The outage was easily explained. The damaged door?


Young said that around 5 a.m. a surveillance camera captured a man, who appeared to be homeless and intoxicated, picking up one of the business' outdoor dining tables. Young said he “smashed the front door three to four times and left.""


The man did not break in after damaging the door and no money was reported missing, according to Young.


""He destroyed it for no reason,"" he said.


The surveillance footage has been delivered to the Charlottesville Police Department, Young said.

Another Mudhouse employee, George Patterson, told The Daily Progress that the suspect appeared to be ""a White male with curly hair and facial hair,"" based on the surveillance footage.


The Charlottesville Police Department did not immediately respond to a Daily Progress inquiry.


Young said he has only been working at Mudhouse for six months, but that management had told him there had been a break-in at the coffee shop a few
years ago. Someone had entered the
establishment after smashing one of its windows, he said.

I was a binge drinker, and while I was always sneaking extra drinks behind my husbands back, he could keep up with me pretty well (and not be addicted to it like I was somehow). When I quit he was happy to stop, we don’t keep alcohol in our home and he only has a drink maybe a couple times a year, like a cocktail at our anniversary dinner or a glass of wine when offered one at family Christmas type of thing. When we did both drink though I would pour us each a shot and we’d go “cheers dear!” And clink them before drinking them. I thought I would miss doing that but we’ve found quite a few non alcoholic things that we’ve cheers’d with instead and I figured I would share a few with you all 😊 

* S’mores we made with our kids (the first of the summer!) 

* fresh strawberries bought from a local farm stand

* the first bite of food at a nice dinner

* freshly made lemonades at a fair

* the first cups of coffee of the morning when camping

* our first ice creams of the summer from the best place in town that’s only open seasonally

* slices of pizza from the fancier/more expensive pizza place that we don’t make it out to/order from as often

I totally get that this might seem like a silly post to some, but I remember when I first quit and felt like I was mourning the ritual of us drinking together. It’s felt like a way to reclaim that though, and to call out and appreciate the more wholesome, fulfilling moments and things we bond over and celebrate instead. Life has its ups and downs sober or not, but even the hard times feel easier without alcohol and it’s effects making them harder and more miserable, and I appreciate the peaceful, quiet moments and the little things so much more now that I don’t drink anymore. Life felt heavy and stressful when I was obsessed with when I was having my next drink, when I was sneaking around trying to drink more without anyone noticing, when I was lying about how much I was drinking. Hoping everyone finds some peaceful little moments over their weekend worth a (non alcoholic) cheers! IWNDWYT ❤️",7,1750514337.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

I am staying in Yosemite West for 3 nights towards the end of August. I have a wife and 3 kids (16, 13, 9) and we enjoy outdoor stuff. We plan to self cater the trip and will be buying picnic and BBQ supplies before we arrive. I have used AI to help me pull together an itinerary, but I would love some human advice from people that are familiar with the area, especially if you are used to visiting with children.

  
This is what I have pulled together - please feel free to critique it heavily and offer alternative advice - especially if you think there are iconic views / walks that we should be doing instead.:

  
Day 1 - arrive at 4pm in Yosmite West. Just chill locally, eat in and get an early night

  
Day 2 - Get up early. Arrive at Sential Dome and Taft Point Trail Head before 9am for a 3 hour hike. Then drive up to Glacier point to briefly take in the view and have a sandwich. Drive to Cathedral Beach (stopping at Tunnel View on route to take in the view). Chill at Cathedral Beach along the river and visit Yosemite Village for a snack/coffee/ice cream. Go home for a BBQ and early night.

  
Day 3 - Up early again and drive to Taneya Lake. Try to arrive before 9am and stop on way to take in the view at Olmsted Point. Enjoy walks near lake, picnic and swimming for the day. Leave at 3ish. Chill at lodge. BBQ. Early night.

  
Day 4 - Long drive to Carmel ahead of us, but we will stop at Mariposa Grove for the brief walk to see the giant trees.

  
I would really appreciate any advice on the above. It is such a big place, Im not sure how to prioritise things.",2,1750513997.0,Yosemite,1,1.0,False

My mother passed away two weeks ago, heart failure they said, ""I didn't believe them."" When I went to collect her things, the nurse explained to me that all her things had been collected by ""her sister."" My mom didn't have a sister; in fact, growing up, I never even met my mother's parents, my grandparents. The only family I knew outside of my immediate family was my dad's family. The nurse told me that the person who picked up my mother's stuff left a note:

""Meet me at the diner on 16th."" It read. 

When I arrived at the diner, I was flagged down by a middle-aged woman with bouncy red hair. She wore a black leather jacket, a white shirt, and black leggings. 

""Aunt Ginger?"" I asked. 

""Hey, kiddo, it's been a while."" Ginger answered. 

Ginger wasn't my real aunt, more like a good family friend. I've only seen her a handful of times in the past when I was a kid, a few times when I was older, at my brother's funeral, and again at my father's. 

""What are you doing here?"" I asked as I sat down in front of her.

""I'm sorry about your mom."" She said as she reached across and put her hand on mine. 

""Thanks... but you didn't answer my question."" I responded. 

""I wanted to see you. I know things haven't been easy..."" She began. 

""No, they haven't."" I interrupted as I wiped away tears. ""You have my mom's stuff?"" I asked. 

""What was left behind."" She sighed. 

""Wait, what do you mean by that?"" I asked. 

""Your mom kept a diary from when she was younger up until she died. It was missing when I collected her things."" She answered. 

""Who would've taken it?"" I asked. 

She didn't answer immediately; instead, she just stirred her coffee as she looked at the snowfall outside the window. 

""Listen...Ryleigh... you can't go back there. I know you think you'll find answers there, but all that is there is death."" She responded.

""What are you talking about?"" I demanded. 

""I know you're planning on going back to Sleepy Falls."" She responded. 

""I have to! That thing took my entire family from me!"" I said as I slammed my fist into the table. 

The commotion of the diner halted as the sound of silverware clinking against dinner plates was silenced. Heads turned in our direction, all wondering about the disruption in their dining experience. 

""We should go,"" Ginger said. 

We exited the diner and embraced the cold winter. 

""Can I give you a ride?"" Ginger asked as she put on a pair of gloves. 

I nodded in agreement.

Ginger's car was an old beater; the backseat was littered with various cans of beer and empty cups of ramen. 

""Do you live in your car?"" I asked.

""No, I just work a lot in my car."" She responded.

""What do you do?"" I asked.

""I'm a P.I., you know... private investigator,"" she answered. 

""I know what it is."" I said. ""I need to go back.... I have to kill that thing."" I repeated. 

Ginger sighed deeply. ""There are worse things in Sleepy Falls than the Mannatari."" She said. 

""The Mannatari?"" I asked.

She silently drove for a moment as we passed by the motel I was staying at. 
""That was my stop,"" I said. 

""I know... there's someone you need to meet."" She responded.

We drove about two hours west; the snow had lightened up, but there were still patches on the ground by the road. The drive was quiet. Ginger has never really been a person you spoke much to when I had been around her, but that was fine; I didn't feel like talking much myself. After a while, we finally arrived at our destination, a retirement home called 'Shady Beech Retirement Community.''

We walked in, and Ginger spoke with the nurse for a moment; she then turned to me and gestured for me to follow. We met with an elderly African American man in a wheelchair. He was skinny with a gray beard and hair, but you could tell he was handsome when he was younger. 

""Ryleigh... this is Thomas Burgess."" She said, introducing me to him.

""Well... if it isn't my old friend Ginger. How have you been?"" He said with a raspy voice. 

""How have you been, Tommy?"" She asked with a smile, but with sadness in her eyes. 

""Oh, you know, getting old."" He laughed. 
""Tommy, this is Ryleigh, Grant and Nicole's daughter."" She said, pointing to me.

""Nice to meet you..."" I said, confused. 
I had never met this man before; my parents never mentioned him. Not ever. 

""Ah, yes. You look just like your mother, but you have your father's eyes. Stubborn and determined."" He chuckled. 

""How did you know my parents?"" I asked. 

""We were friends. A long time ago."" He said.

""Tommy was my age when your parents met him."" Ginger answered. 

""What happened?"" I asked. 

Tommy explained to me how a girl had disappeared from camp, and he and my father volunteered to look for her. He eventually found himself in a mine. As he explored the mine, he could feel his sense of time and self slipping away from him. He could hear my father's voice calling out to him, and he called back, but he was too deep in the mine. 

""Your father tried to find me, but I couldn't find my way back."" He explained. ""I went into that mine as a teenager, and I came out sixty-three years old. I just turned ninety this year.
 It's a difficult time, having all your memories of being a child and a young man, but none of you growing up and growing old."" 

A normal person wouldn't have believed this; just chalk it up to the ramblings of an old man. But after what I've seen, his story didn't seem so far-fetched. 

""Do you understand, Ryleigh? That town, that whole forest... The Mannatari is one of several nightmares that inhabit the area."" Ginger explained. 

""I don't care... I don't care what's there... I need to go back... I need to kill that thing... to put my brother's soul to rest."" I said.

As I got up from my chair, Tommy desperately reached for my hand to grab it. 

""Y-your father... he visited me before he died. He said when he went back to look for your brother, everything came back to him. He had forgotten, but when he returned, he remembered everything. He said he could hear the mine call to him... I hear it sometimes, too."" Tommy said, breathing heavily.

""I think that's enough for today. Thank you for seeing us, Tommy."" Ginger said, putting her hand on Tommy's shoulder.

The car ride back was somehow even quieter. I knew that there was something really fucked up about that place, but even with Aunt Ginger's warnings, even with Tommy's story... I had to go back to Sleepy Falls. It was nighttime when we eventually pulled up to the motel I had been staying at. 

""I really can't convince you not to go, can I?"" Ginger asked.

I shook my head.

""You know there are no buses that run there anymore."" She said.

""I can get a car."" I answered.

Ginger then turned the car off and pulled the keys out of the ignition. 

""Take mine."" She said as she handed me her keys. ""It's the least I can do."" She said.

I couldn't sleep that night; the anticipation of the next day kept me up. Ginger stayed the night and slept on the second bed in my room. The next morning, she was gone, a single note left behind, an old piece of paper with pencil scribbled across it. It looked like something transferred from a book; it read, ""Camp Rules."" 


The drive to Sleepy Falls was a dreadful experience, while I was fueled by hatred of the thing that destroyed my family, I couldn't stop but feeling terrified. Knowing there were a whole litany of nightmares there, had me on edge.  I wish I had a smoke or a drink, something to numb my fear and anxiety. 

When I arrived to Sleepy Falls, I expected to either have to sneak into the forest or go in guns blazing, but neither option was needed. The town was empty, where as every other time I'd been here the residents had met me with their silent blank stares, there was no one. In place of the residents, instead stood mannequins, placed meticulously in locations and positioned in way as if they were performing the duties of their represented residents. 

Everything seemed like it was frozen in time, yet there we several anomalies that I had noticed. The bread from the bakery was warm and smelled fresh as if it were baked this morning. The clocks on the walls were all stuck at the same time: 2:33a.m., yet the sun still shined through the clouds above. The roads  were plowed, but there we no vehicles in site. I stood close to one of the mannequins, one dressed like a sheriff, he just like right through me, these were just ordinary mannequins. 

""C-can I help you, young lady?"" A voice asked. 

I turned around to see a homeless man close to my own age. He was dirty and ragged wearing a puffy jacket that was torn on various places. He was missing several teeth and hid hair was long and stringy. 

""What happen to all the people that lived here?"" I asked.  

""Why.... they are all around you? Don't you see them?"" He asked. 

He obviously wasn't all there, possibly dangerous. 

""Are you a hunter?"" He asked gesturing towards the shotgun strung over my shoulder. 

""Ummm.... yeah I'm a hunter."" I said.  

""What are you hunting? Rabbits? You won't find any here? You won't find much of anything here."" He laughed. 

""I'm Simon, by the way. "" the homeless man said extending his hand forward to shake mine. 

""I'm Ryleigh..."" I said as I hesitantly extended my hand forward. 

He then reached towards me and grabbed my wrist.

""Ryleigh? Ryleigh? RYLEIGH?! Ryleigh, Ryleigh, Ryleigh, Ryleigh, Ryleigh!"" He screamed. 

I was able to break free of his grasp and immediately turned and began to run. 

""RUN! RABBIT! RUN!"" He screamed at me. 

I turned to see Simon get on all fours and begin chasing me. His movements appeared unnatural, yet seemed to be normal for him. I couldn't outrun him, I had to turn and fight.  As he approached closer, he moved from all fours back to two legs, but he didn't run at me the way a normal full grown adult would, but moved the way a toddler would. I pulled my shotgun from around my back and slammed the butt of it into his face. The sudden stop caused him to fall backwards into the snow. He attempted to get back to, but I kicked him in the face knocking him out. I dragged him over to a nearby bench and used zipties I had brought with me to secure him to the bench.

By the time I reached the camp, it was mid afternoon. If these rules were to be believed, I need to get in and out of the forest and the area before nightfall. The camp looked the same as it did ten years ago, all the bunkhouses were still in pristine condition, no cobwebs, no termite damage. I searched the bunkhouse for anything useful, anything I can use against the Mannatari. 

I was about to find a chef's knife, a small hatchet and a small book. The book had a strange hieroglyphic symbol on the front of it, inside it read the following passage: 

'Welcome Children of the Fall
Come and See, she who sees all
Give her yourself, body and soul
She will grant us wisdom of all that is known. '
As I stepped outside, I saw a figure before me, it was Simon, he had released himself by gnawing through his wrist. He looked at me and smiled with his bloody toothless grin as he growled like an animal. He charged me, I pulled up my shotgun and fired a shot into his skull, knocking him to the ground. 

I killed a man, I didn't have to, I shouldn't have. But it was him or me. I checked his body only to discover it was made of plastic, broken pieces of his face sitting inside his hollowed out mannequin head. Was I going insane? Was my mother's madness hereditary? No... the Mannatari broke my mother. Destroyed my family. 
 
In the forest, I found a large burrow under a huge tree. There were no animals in this forest, so I knew it had to belong to the Mannatari. Before I entered, I took stock of all my items, reloaded my shotgun and grabbed a headlamp for light. I descended into the burrow, under the tree, deeper into the lair of the Mannatari. When I found it,  it seemed inanimate, sleeping amongst the roots of the tree above. 

It had a head was made out of a bear's skull, it's body was made of wood and wrapped vines, except for its ribcage which was made him bone. Within the ribcage I could see it's organs pulsating inside. I raised my shotgun to it's head and fired a shot, it shrieked in pain as it awoke thrashing against the roots that held it. I pumped the next shell and fired the next round hitting it's chest, another shot aimed for its chest, but the creature's flailing limbs knocked my barrel down causing the shot to hit it's leg. Before I could reload, the creature successfully broke free and knocked my shotgun from my hands. I pulled out the hatchet ready to continue the fight, but then I felt the hair on the back of my back stand up and a wave of static run over me. 

I was in another part of the forest, the forest shifted and moved me away from the Mannatari. 

""Fuck! Fuck!"" I wailed as I dropped to my knees and began bashing the hatchet in my hand against the dirt. 

Not only did I fail to kill it, but I lost my shotgun as well. I collected myself and got back on my feet, but before I could move forward, I felt a hand to over my mouth and a sharp prick in my neck and all went black. 


When I came to I was sitting in the forest with my hands tied behind my back with my own zipties. 

""I told you not to come back,  but you didn't listen."" A familiar voice said to me. 

""Aunt Ginger?"" I questioned.  

As my vision became clear I saw Ginger approach me from the dark. Her face illuminated by the light of the lantern nearby. 

""No. I'm not Ginger."" She said as she removed the large red wig from her head revealing her short slicked back blonde hair. ""My name is Ashley."" She said.  

""Ashley? Who the fuck are you? What did you do with Ginger?"" I demanded. 

""I didn't do anything to Ginger. Years ago, she helped your mother and father escape this place. She was injured, but was able to patch up her wound. Once your parents were safe, she tried to drive to a hospital. But she lost too much blood already and crashed."" Ashley explained. ""I learned about her death from the cult, who kept tabs on your parent's as well and were responsible for their loss of memories regarding the events of that night."" She explained as she paced back in forth. ""I figured the cult was done with your parents after that. 

""What the fuck is this? Some sort of villain monolog?"" I asked as I thrashed against the zipties.

""That was until until your parents returned years later, with you and your brother. After that, I assumed Ginger's identity to keep a closer eye on all of you. Then your brother came to the camp and was killed by the Mannatari, but your parents' connection to this place drew the Mannatari to leave it's territory and go to your home. I knew you would want to come here and I tried to stop you."" She explained. 

""Why me? Why did this all happen to me?"" I demanded. 

""You saw the people in town, right?"" She asked.  

I nodded. 

""The god has become more unpredictable than ever, before she would only manifest nightmares and legends, but now she is changing things, altering reality. The current leader of the cult, Russell, he wants to control this power."" She explained. ""He wants to use you as it's vessel. He attempted once before in his own son, but his mother escaped with the baby. "" she explained.  

""Why are you telling me all this?"" I asked. 

Ashley looked at me with saddened eyes. She pittied me, ""I felt you need to know the truth and I why I have to kill you."" She answered. 

""Whoa! Wait! You don't have to do this!"" I said. ""Ashley, look at me, you can help me kill the Mannatari, and then I'm gone, I'll never return here again."" I said.  

""Even in the face of death, you only want to kill the creature. Even if you do kill it, another one will manifest in it's place."" She said. 

""Then I'll leave. You'll never see me again."" I pleaded. 

""But you will come back, whether you kill the Mannatari or not, you will return. The god that lives here, she sees us as her children. And a mother will always call her children home."" She said as she pulled out a knife and began to approached me. 

""Ashley! Look at me! You may have not been my aunt, but you watched me, you warned me not to come back. Something in you must care about me."" I screamed at her. 

Ashley stopped for a moment and began to cry. ""So much blood on my hands. All those people... and children I've sacrificed in service to the cult... one more sacrifice and it's over."" She cried. 

Before she could step any further a claw made of branches burst through her stomach and lifter her off the ground. The Mannatari has found us. 

The creature ripped Ashley apart consuming her organs in the process, as it did so, slipped my arms through my legs and in front of me.  

The creature then turned its attention on me, ""I-I told you to stay away, b-but you didn't listen!"" It screamed in Ashley's voice. 
It began to charge towards me and as it did, I grabbed the nearby kerosene lamp and threw it at the Mannatari it bursting against its skull, igniting it's wooden body. The creature cried in panic as it ran past me and into the woods. I was able to cut myself lose with the knife that Ashley had dropped, grabbed my hatchet and I chased after the creature. 

When I found it, the thing was laying in a puddle of melted snow, it's body extinguished, but badly burnt. It didn't have the strength of the creature I had fought earlier, it was weakened and withered. I raised my hatchet and brought it down on its ribcage chipping away bone until it's wooden organ were exposed. They were beating and pulsating so quickly, it was scared. I raised the hatchet for the killing blow, when it spoke to me: 

""Ryleigh... sister....Love you..."" it said with Max's voice, perfectly imitating it. 

It was the first time I'd heard Max's voice in ten years, tears streamed down my cheeks, their warmth cracked against the brittle cold, I felt my heart drop into my chest, I wanted to scream with every ounce of breath that I had. I brought the hatchet down on its heart, splitting it in two, it's putrid black sap splashing against my face and my coat. The creature let out a loud death rattle as I watched the light in it's eyes fade to black. The Mannatari was finally dead, with its death I let out a scream so primal, it hadn't been heard since the first hunter slayed the first beast. 

I slayed my demon and avenged my family; my head was finally silent, my heart no longer heavy. I don't even know how I made it out of the forest and back to my car. The whole time I expected attackers in robes to beset me, but it never happened. I just leaned my head against the steering wheel and cried. 

I visited Tommy one last time; he was happy to see me and told me I looked like a different person. I told him about Ginger and Ashley; he was sad to hear about both of their deaths. I told him I couldn't see him again; he understood when I explained everything to him.


""I don't have much time left. I hear the mine calling me more and more. But I'm glad you gave this old man one last visit."" He said with a smile. He then handed me an envelope filled with cash. ""Take it, I don't need it where I'm going."" He said. 

I've been on the move since, never staying in one location for long. Cash will run out eventually and I'll have to pick to odd jobs here and there, then move again. Always looking over my shoulder. At night, I hear her voice, calling to me, calling me home. ",3,1750513607.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

had my mind on sharpening/honing/practicing my crochet skills for the past few weeks (!) already but I never got to it 🤣 last night I was like ok I'll take myself out for a coffee with some yarn and see where we go

ended up making the bottom coaster, reached home to realise OH I MADE A VERY VERY SIMILAR ONE BEFORE (same yarn slightly different shades) 😬

top one is abit older and the yarn is slightly faded but I think if I wash and stretch both out a bit they should still be ok. bottom one is abit finicky like honestly I'm not super pleased cos the tension is abit off (v tight, I ended up upsizing my hook for the border 😬) but oh well \~

Not really sure what I wanna do to hone/practice my skills (when do we start making Christmas gifts if they are small ones like these? Is Aug/Sept ok? 🤣), or alternatively I wanna try making myself a bag. A small one, maybe a (small) tote or pouch. I made one last time which didn't require inserting a commercial tote to crochet around, so I'm too scared to use it cos I'm afraid of stretch 🤣

So I wanna try a smaller one this time and the kind that requires an insert of a commercial tote! (I'll probably get the smallest and cheapest at Muji cos yarn will alr cost a ton. & ya Spotlight not discounting the 4seasons Flinders yarn now so I'll wait for the discount I think)

My recipe is 3x weight of the beans and do it 5 pours every 45 seconds. So if it was 12g I do 36ml, if it was 16 I do 48-50ml.

1lgwwxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1lgwwxj/recovered_from_chronic_gastritis/,Recovered from chronic gastritis,"TLDR: i recovered after suffering from moderate chronic gastritis for about a year.  Do not let negativity in forums like these make you lose hope.  

*May-June 2024: Symptoms begin*
My symptoms began after recovering from what appeared as food poisoning while traveling abroad for work.   Initially, they were not extreme: mostly a gnawing feeling under my ribs, loose stools, and a weird sense of anxiety (I never had anxiety issues before).  

As the time progressed, it then became the loss of appetite, elevated heart rate (my resting heart rate was above 100), and nausea, and more intense pain in my upper abdomen.   

I went to see my primary physician who first sent me to cardiologist due to elevated heart rate and some previous heart history, but cardiologist cleared me and said that sudden increase in heart rate could sometimes be due to my body fighting inflammation or infection. 

I went back to my primary doctor who prescribed pantoprazole and said to come back in 30 days.  Since I did not really feel heartburn, i did research on my own and asked to be tested for H-pylori (weirdly, my doctor only gave it me after i insisted).  

*July - August 2024*
My H-pylori test came back positive and i did 2 weeks of quadri therapy with Pylera.  

During antibiotics, my symptoms actually worsened and it seemed like they exarcebated my gastritis (even though they were successful in eliminating H-pylori).  I started losing weight rapidly (about 20 libs in 6 weeks), felt strong pain under my ribs/upper stomach, which became more intense if my stomach was empty for longer than 2 hours.  

I felt like I had to eat every 2 hours, yet my diet was very limited (I was following Capellan’s Gastritis diet) and i had some discomfort regardless of what I ate.  

My life became very isolating.  I was constantly in discomfort and i started feeling very depressed and was losing hope.  Doctors didn’t know what the cause was — ordered a bunch of stool and blood tests but they all came back normal apart from pretty severe iron deficiency (atypical for me since I get iron checked annually and this is the first time I got this result).

*September: Diagnosis confirmed*
I was finally ordered upper endoscopy and my results came back as moderate chronic gastritis + active inflammation.   Symptoms persisted, with minimal improvement.  My doctor wanted to put me back on pantoprazole but i was reluctant to take due to iron deficiency (PPIs make it difficult to absorb iron).   

*Oct-Nov*
I continued bland diet (at this point, I was in it for 5 months) but had minimal improvements.  I started taking zinc carousine and that seemed to help a bit.   I also started doing yoga 4 times a week and meditation every day, which was helpful with my mental health.  

I retested for h-pylori 3 times during this period because i was concerned that my symptoms meant that it was not eradicated. But all three tests came back negative.   

*Dec—Jan*
Finally, I started feeling some improvement.  For me, relaxing my diet was helpful since I think the bland diet deprived me of some key nutrients.  I continued with Zinc Carosine and yoga, and also addd l-glutamine into my routine.   I could feel the improvement although things were far from normal.  

*February- March 2025: improvement continues *
I continued with supplements but started taking more risk with food and started going out to restaurants (while still being mindful of my diet)

*Today (June 2025)*
I’m largely back to normal.  I can eat anything I want (I just had 3 slices of pepperoni pizza, lol) and as of this month, I’m startling to drink coffee again.   I regained 20 pounds that I lost.  The only lingering feeling I have is if I skip a meal, I get a gnawing sensation in my stomach that goes away after I eat.  But things are good, Im traveling again, and am fully able to enjoy life.  

*Things that were helpful for me*
— Supplements: Zinc Carosine and L-glutamine
— iron and vitamin d, since I became deficient.   Note that iron can aggravate gastritis so be very careful of what form to take if you are deficient.  What worked for me were Barimelts and I started with half pill a day and built up slowly to the full dose.   
— yoga and meditation were essential for my mental health.  I also used Nerva, a meditation  program for IBS.  Although I didn’t have IBS, the guided visualization is about feeling good in your stomach area which really helped.  

*Things that were less helpful*
— Manuka honey.  I continued taking it due to positive impact on h pylori but I don’t think it actually helped gastritis
— George’s Aloe: had no defect 

Note about the diet: I believe that bland, non acidic diet is very helpful.  
But I also believe that Capellan’s gastritis diet is too restrictive and puts you at risk of malnutrition.  I started feeling better after I started integrating more foods (eg. red meat) when I was sure it did not bother me significantly.  For example, I was okay after eating a petite steak but was in pain after eating a bowl of strawberries.   This is at least my experience and may not be yours.  

And finally, taking a break from this forum was implement for my mental health.  My doctor (at Stanford) tells me that only 20 percent of folks don’t recover after a year.  80 percent do.  But those 80 percent don’t continue to hangout on Reddit threads so there is a very skewed representation here.   

If you are suffering from mild or moderate gastritis, don’t lose hope.  There is a strong likelihood this is just a blip in your life and that you will recover.  I did.

1lgwve7,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1lgwve7/june_21_2025/,"June 21, 2025","**Good morning. Our keynote is Acceptance.**

Today's Twenty-Four Hour meditation and prayer quiet whisper is one of spiritual alignment, that if we are to live a God-conscious life, we must also cultivate peace of mind, serenity, and a calm heart. These are not luxuries; they are necessities for the soul seeking Divine guidance.

My sponsor once told me, ""*When you truly know the answer, you no longer need to ask the question.*"" Acceptance, then, is not passive, it is an act of wisdom. Accept people as they are, yes, but do not assign them roles in your life they were never meant to play. You are the steward of your spirit. With prayer as your board of directors, you may hire, fire, and promote accordingly.

Step Eleven is not a ritual, it is a lifeline. To improve our conscious contact with God is to return to sanity each day. And Step Three? It is not made once, but moment by moment. When discomfort arises, service is the balm. Put your hand out. Make coffee. Wipe down chairs. God works through the smallest gestures.

Now, when life turns upside down, and it will, be cautious of that voice that says, ""*You already know what to do.*"" That is the voice of self-will disguised as certainty. True wisdom often begins with ""*I don't know.*"" And when I get it right? Beware, pride comes dressed in spiritual clothing too.

Craig, thank goodness, always reminds me: you must use and? practice the ""*trust God*"" muscle regularly, or it won't hold when you truly need to lean on it. And yes, alcoholics, in our drama and distortion, can pole-vault over mouse turds while ignoring mountains of grace.

And so, the formula is simple: **Pause. Pray. Proceed.** That, my friends, is the miracle.

I no longer live in constant resentment, not because life has become easier, but because I've stepped out of the director's chair. I've turned the management of my life over to a Higher Power, and I say often and sincerely, **""Thy will, not mine, be done.""** And wouldn't you know, by not of my own design, it works.

Because if we don't? If we let those old resentments take root, they will flower into something far more dangerous. *They will whisper lies that lead us back to a drink.* And that, we cannot afford.

**This path works. It really does.**

Photo 2: The meal. I took an antihistamine in advance to limit bloating. Black coffee, small slice of yeast-free bread (soft sourdough), half a spoon of jam.

Photo 3: My stomach half an hour after eating. The bloating is painful.

This has started happening after every meal. If I don’t take antihistamines and lactase (if I’m eating dairy), it is even worse.

The bloating gets worth with fatigue. It can coincides with painful rosacea and flushing. The worst trigger foods tingle, burn my mouth, and leave welts in my mouth. I can also get painful reactions to even hypoallergenic skincare products and metal, like snaps on clothing.

I have done exclusion diets to no end. I have cut out the worst triggers. Still, everything I eat causes pain. When I discover that a food is ‘safe’ and eat it often, it becomes a trigger.

1lgwtkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1lgwtkj/insomnia_and_mental_health_medications_are/,Insomnia and mental health medications are ruining my life and health. What actually works?,"Background: Suffered from depression and anxiety pretty much throughout my whole life. Always suspected I had poor sleep because I would need to sleep a lot and would still feel 'low energy', but had a lot of stressors pile on me at once now (long-term unemployment, divorce, anxiety about the future, etc.) So, I decided to start a medication journey to 'assist' me in getting through and helping to manage a lot of crying and anxiety. I feel like I have now tried SO many medications now in an attempt to find 'the right one' that my body and brain neurons are just confused - and more importantly, chronic insomnia has developed. 

We started with SSRIs. I didn't like that they were increasing my heart rate or I just didn't know if they were doing anything. Then, along the way, I started having insomnia (never had before), so the psychiatrist prescribed Seroquel (20 mg), an antipsychotic, for off-label use as a sleep aid. It was working for sleep, so I stayed on it for at least 6 months to a year. She also had me try a mood stabilizer, but I thought it made me more emotional? Went off Seroquel cold turkey (BAD IDEA) - had crazy heart rates, insomnia, tremors, etc. So, I was then put on Aripiprazole (another antipsychotic) for several months. Wanted to come off medication altogether. Tapered down for a month, then went to 0. The worst insomnia ever along with akathisia for 4 weeks! I thought I could get through the withdrawals, but after 4 weeks of the insomnia getting worse instead of better, I agreed to try Mirtazapine (Tetracyclic sedative antidepressant). It helped me get much needed sleep, albeit still 'fragmented sleep'. Stayed on that for a month. Expressed that I do not want to be on medication long-term because after experiencing all of this, I do not want my body to become dependent on medication for sleep. So, we did a cross-taper to Lexapro, and then .... INSOMNIA again. And now the new side effect? HYPNIC JERKS when I'm trying to sleep is compounding this whole insomnia-sleep deprivation issue. 

When I tried to go off all medication before for 4 weeks, I tried everything to try and naturally get through the rebound insomnia that developed: 

\-Regular sleep schedule (9:30 pm - 6:30 am) 

\-Plenty of water, only coffee in the morning, and no alcohol

\-Exercise earlier in the day

\-Eating healthy 

\-Calm supplement at night before bedtime

\-Melatonin (5 mg) 

\-Magesium glycinate (200 mg) before bedtime

\-Warm milk

\-Hot showers

\-Guided meditations

\-Cool, dark room

\-Sleep sounds or music to drown out external noise 

\-Cannaboid gummies

\-A weighted soft blanket

\-Chamomile tea



Despite all these efforts, my insomnia was getting worse instead of better and the akathisia from aripiprazole wasn't going away until I started taking Mirtazapine. So, right now I am on a low dose of Mirtazapine (3.75 to 7.5 mg) to still help me get some kind of sleep with 5 mg Lexapro in the morning. But, reflecting on this journey, I'm utterly frustrated because do I have depression and anxiety? For sure. But did I have insomnia before all this? No. Maybe poor sleep sometimes, but never anything like this. I was really trying to give it some time and hoping to find the right medication because it is not fun when you easily cry, have negative thought patterns all the time, feel low energy, have memory problems, etc. BUT, is it worth all these side effects that keep coming up? These past 2 years of going on medication have caused my overall health to now decline when I am actually quite a healthy person with a healthy lifestyle otherwise. Elevated heart rates, heart palpitations, blood pressure changes, insomnia, hypnic jerks, akathisia, sudden onset of gray hair, etc. This is affecting my ability to function in daily life. 

Can anyone else relate to feeling like their health and sleep became worse AFTER starting on mental health meds? Any success stories of being able to come off all mental health medications, getting through withdrawals, and managing depression and anxiety naturally? How long did it take you? What was your process? What 'cured' your insomnia? 

I am conflicted about what to do. I have read that certain health conditions later in life can develop if you have low serotonin or other neurotransmitter imbalances. (risk of dementia, Alzheimer's, IBS, insomnia, etc.) So, part of me wants to go off all medication, but then I worry about not taking it either.

Looking forward to all your responses.

Walked down to the Olympic rings. Metro back and crashed for the night. 

Next day metro to Notre Dame at 930 without reservations and walked right in. Daughter wanted to see Saints-Chapelle. About a half hour wait without tickets. Wife and daughter loved it. It was very pretty but a bit overpriced for me. Went just north of the Seine to walk some thirft stores for clothes. The selection is wild but found some things we liked. Prices were decent. Lunch on a side street was very good. Wide and daughter did a perfume making class found thru another post here called Candora. They loved it. I walked around more and just got lost. Ended up having a cup of coffee in a cat cafe to support the local rescue. Dinner was back by our hotel at Clutch. Best meal we had. 

Day 3 Disneyland. We are Disney people. Loved the parks. Rides were fun. RER out and back was easy. 

Overall: it was hot but there’s water points around. Took it easy and rested when we needed to. Everyone was nice. Like people say on here a simple bonjour then speak nicely.

Friends were never told they would be technically “roommates” with this person. They thought it was 2 separate residences like a duplex. The owner would find any excuse to ring the doorbell, call incessantly, or stop them when they were coming or going to ask them questions. 
I stayed overnight with them one time because I had too much to drink. At 7:30am their doorbell started ringing. My friend had gone to get coffee so I answered and it was the landlord wanting to know who I was and what was I doing there. I was so scared!

tl;dr: Different people have different preferences and taste, let them chose whatever they wish!

I have been a long user of Displate and have purchased many plates over the course of years.  
And YES, a lot of them were AI artworks (if artwork along with AI word trigger you, know that I consider them artwork/works, your philosophy might be different)

Why I have chosen them? Because they look fabulous!! Simple as that!  
When someone walks into my house and look at those plates, they go WOW and ask me where I got it!!  
NOBODY, literally NOBODY has ever asked me which artist made it, or the sob story behind the artist's life or if the artist created it with soul and emotion!!

At the end of the day, I want my wall to look amazing. That's it.   
I don't care about if its made by artist, a dog, god or AI generated.

Look, you might have different philosophy, like support the artist, etc. Go knock yourself out with that but why try to force it down the throat of others?  
Just few days back I saw a post where a user was interested in buying a trending artwork that was AI generated and some people started talking against it.

Let people have what they want!! It's so simple!!  
TBH, I am pretty sure majority of people don't care and Displate is well aware of it given they might be getting lot of sales on it, they have decided not to ban it. 

I understand a lot of handwork and effort is put by the artists to make artwork but I have also heard news of artists selling banana and air in the name of art. Randomly throwing paints and scribbling on the canvas and calling it art.  
If those things give you kick of ""Soul"", ""meaning"" and other things, good, art is subjective!!

And yes, there are really good artists too, and if you really want their work, go get it, even I have bought few, and be happy, why try to argue with other people's choices and interests?

If this isn't your cup of coffee, ignore it. That's it!!

I asked one of my friend who works in arts industry and his response gonna be a shocker for some people.  
As per him, avoiding AI tools is non-existence, and his company is actively using it to make assets for games. ( gonna stop playing games now?)  
When I asked about copyright, He told me, that artists has been using copyright material which they randomly download over the internet or other artist's works, as a reference, matte painting, integrating into commissioned work and making digital assets like brushes and all, all the time. Even after buying licensed material, using it beyond to what license permits is quite common. Using pirated softwares are different ball games.   
Well I am not here to talk about copyright, integrity, philosophy and all.

Just seeing the hostile attitude of some people towards other who are willing to buy works that is AI generated for their own wall is quite surprising.

IBS-C,"I've been suffering from constipation since I was 6 years old. My teenage years were really rough. Sometimes, I would go 7 or 8 days without having a bowel movement. Over the years, the constipation has become more stable. Until about two years ago, I was going to the bathroom every other day. But recently, especially since I started working in high-stress positions, I’ve been experiencing what I believe is a very intense gastrocolic reflex.

I’ve had to quit coffee because it would trigger an immediate bowel movement, and on top of that, it would irritate my anus so badly that I couldn’t even sit down due to the pain. Heavy meals trigger it too. I can’t drink carbonated beverages anymore either because the cramps are extremely intense. The last time I drank a Red Bull, not only did I have almost immediate diarrhea, but I also passed mucus with blood. This happened six months ago and it was the first time I saw blood-streaked mucus, which really scared me. I mentioned it to my doctor, but he said it’s normal in patients with IBS-C.

Constipation has now become a secondary issue. My doctor has no idea how to help me with the gastrocolic reflex. His theory is that I have dysbiosis as a consequence of the long-time constipation, and he’s convinced I have SIBO (without running any tests) just because my stomach is always distended (some days I literally look pregnant, lol). His only idea to help with the gastrocolic reflex has been to prescribe Movicol, thinking that if I go to the bathroom more regularly, maybe we can ease the reflex. He prescribed Spiraxin for two weeks but it did nothing for me.

I’m starting to wonder if I even have dysbiosis at all, because he hasn’t confirmed it in any way. Could it be that what I actually have is Dumping Syndrome? Sometimes the reflex is so extreme that I can’t even make it to the bathroom in time, and this is becoming a real problem for me since I’ve always been constipated, and now I’m having uncontrollable diarrhea episodes where I barely have time to get to the toilet.

The sky — oh, the sky! — was a canvas where nature had playfully scattered her brush strokes: long, elegant clouds stretched their arms, floating like silent, weightless islands in an ocean of pale lavender and silver-blue.

As the sun dipped lower, shy and graceful, its last rays bathed the buildings in a delicate blush. The creamy beige walls and red-tiled roofs below glowed warmly, as if they too were exhaling, grateful for the coolness slowly wrapping around them. The world beneath seemed to pause — even the restless city wore a robe of calm, its usual clamor softened to a distant hum.

A lone palm tree swayed gently, its silhouette cutting into the sky like a humble sentinel watching over this quiet drama. Birds, tiny black dots against the vast expanse, returned home, their wings slicing the sky with effortless grace. Somewhere, a dog barked lazily, and a faint aroma of evening meals being prepared wafted up — familiar, comforting.

I let my thoughts drift. The sky, ever-changing, reminded me of life itself — moments of turbulence, moments of peace, all blending seamlessly into one grand narrative. The clouds moved, not in a hurry, but with a purpose only they knew. And I, a small spectator, stood still, breathing in the simplicity of this refreshing hour.

There was no urgency here. No deadlines. No expectations. Just the symphony of wind, sky, and fading light — a melody only the heart could truly hear. For a moment, I felt utterly weightless, as if my worries had been folded into those drifting clouds and carried far, far away.

Ilanti enno drooling sunsets ni miss ayyanu. But once in a while chusthe ocche refreshing feeling, regular ga chusthe radhu. Oka rakanga idhi therapy naku. Ilanti sunset chustu coffee thaguthu, busy roads, traffic sounds, masjid prayers chala baundi. Miru kuda ilanti feeling ni enjoy chestara???? Okavela cheste ela enjoy chestaro chepandi.

Breakfast every morning is my standard mashed potatoes + gravy + 2 lbs steamed veggies 

Other meals, depending on hunger, are mostly:

\- chocolate (sweet potato) pudding

\- cold veggie plate (including cold potatoes) with either smokey mustard dipping sauce or siracha hummus (both are oil-free)

\- breakfast potatoes (w peppers and onions & ketchup)

\- baked potatoes w just garlic salt or hummus or cheez sauce & broccoli

\- cold baked Japanese sweet potatoes (they're so good I eat them plain!)

I'm also having fruit for snacks if I want it -- cherries, an apple, mandarin oranges.  Not a lot, just every now and then.

First thing in the morning, before my daily exercise, I've started having (vegan oil-free) protein powder in my coffee.  (I know potatoes have plenty of protein, but I've heard it's better for women not to exercise in a completely fasted state, and I'm taking my dogs out for 1-2 hours hiking at like 5:30 in the morning lol.)

So far, I'm letting myself have fruits -- plus beans and oats as ingredients in homemade sauces, dips and gravy -- in addition to mostly potatoes and veggies.  To me, this is the sweet spot and really works for a longer term mostly-potatoes program.  I know I'll be able to continue this pretty easily until I reach my goal, which is to get below 30"" waist.

Honestly, I could eat this way for the rest of my life (and probably will make that a goal lol) just with cheats every now and then.  But it feels great to be back on track with a strict program after a more chaotic winter/holiday season.  Everything is plant-based, whole food and oil-free -- so I'm feeling happy and healthy and really enjoying every meal!",2,1750512531.0,PotatoDiet,0,1.0,False

So, without conditioning, I ran a half-marathon. Am I overreacting?","So, yesterday, I came across a post in this sub-Reddit about a person who was struggling with substance abuse. While people gave him naive-optimistic comments about how he should seek rehab, I gave him a more realistic suggestion.

I’m also an addict: I smoke thirteen cigarettes a day; I drink 800 mg of caffeine—more than the double of what an adult is recommended, and I drink three pints of beer every single day. For 280 days now, except three days, I have done a minimum of three pints, sometimes reaching six, and I never stopped having strong coffee and smoking.

I came close to quitting all those habits, but when I actually did go for sixty-nine days without drinking, for example, really bad things happened to me, and I had to start again because it was the only way to stop me from having a nervous breakdown—not addiction-related; I couldn’t care less about drinking and didn’t miss it.

Now, with my experience above, I saw that the addict who posted on Reddit’s AIO was in a similar situation, and I wanted to suggest something that worked for me.

Instead of quitting what he’s doing, he just needs to find the tolerable amount. With time, his body will tell him. As with me, my body can’t really tolerate four pints of beer, because then I’d have a bit of “slowness” the next morning and some trips to the washroom, but with three, my body seems to be revitalized the next day. And with ten cigarettes, I actually feel good from having them. As for my coffee, I tend to do three days with 400 mg, just to give my body time to rest, then I start back again at 800 for four days.

Now, to counter all this, because everyone in my family is overweight and getting cancer, whereas I’m the only one in my family who smokes and drinks, I chose to start exercising again.

I eat red meat every day of the week, have salad, and sleep seven hours a day during dark hours. Four times a week, I would do 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 64 chin-ups, 100 bench presses at 200 lbs, 100 curls of 30-lb dumbbells, and then I’d hold a 30-pound object while on my knees for about six minutes (eight breaks in between). After this, I’d run for five miles.

When I explained all this to the addict, and how he can find a sustainable way to be addicted, where I managed to lose all my beer belly fat while drinking, and I’m now ripped—I’m so ripped right now—someone on Reddit commented that I was weak and will die a miserable death. When he said this, I decided to prove a point after my tenth cigarette, fourth pint of beer, and my upper-body workout and went for a run. I ended up running 13.1 miles or a half-marathon with minimal cardio conditioning, not so much as a pulled leg muscle. But what I did was dangerous, because I’m normally used to 4.7 miles per run (I call it five, but whatever). I feel spent, but next week, I want to run another half-marathon; I haven’t done these in years since the time I broke my other leg for the second time.

My pee has been consistently (maybe 6 months) smelling exactly like this and I’m not dehydrated. I don’t eat any of the foods that make your pee smell. It’s not dark, light in color. I drink water with electrolytes(nuun) all day and 1-2 sparkling waters with small amount of caffeine, no coffee. Not going more or less than before. I suppose there’s less warning queues and it hits me like I have to go very bad suddenly. But I do drink fast usually. Like 32oz in 10 minutes then stop for 1-2 hours. 
Had a child years ago. No sexual partners since. I am way more tired this year barely keeping up, but I’ve had bad sleep for years. I did move to high altitude 5 years ago but I’ve been drinking plenty up until now. there’s no sweet smell.

1lgw9ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design_WATC/comments/1lgw9ta/ai_in_design_wont_replace_you_it_will_promote_you/,AI in Design Won't Replace You. It Will Promote You.,"A quiet conversation is happening in every design studio, freelance community, and creative team around the globe. It revolves around a single, powerful force: artificial intelligence. For many, this conversation is tinged with anxiety. It brings up questions about job security, originality, and the very value of human creativity. This is a completely understandable response. But the narrative of replacement is missing the real story. The rise of **AI in design** is not an extinction event. It is a promotion.

The tools emerging today are not here to take over your role. They are here to elevate it. They are poised to handle the repetitive, the mundane, and the time-consuming, freeing you to operate at a higher level. Think of it less as a competition and more as a fundamental shift in your job description. You are moving from a pixel-perfect technician to a high-level creative strategist.

This transition requires a new mindset. It asks you to see AI not as a rival, but as the most powerful assistant you have ever had. The question is not about survival. It is about how you will choose to lead in this new landscape.

# The End of the Grind: From Technician to Creative Director

For decades, a significant part of a designer's job involved manual, labor-intensive tasks. Think about the hours spent meticulously masking images, creating dozens of minor variations for a client, or searching through endless stock photo libraries for the ""perfect"" shot. While necessary, this work is often the grind, not the creative spark. It is the execution, not the vision.

This is precisely where **AI in design** steps in. It excels at process-oriented tasks, creative automation, and rapid iteration. It can generate a hundred variations while you are still sketching your first. This is not a threat to your value; it is a liberation of your time and talent.

By offloading the technical grind to AI, your role naturally shifts upward. You are no longer just the person who executes the brief. You become the person who questions the brief, who guides the strategy, and who directs the overall creative vision. You are the conductor of an orchestra of powerful tools, and your job is to make them sing in harmony. What would you do with an extra ten hours a week? Would you spend more time understanding your client's business? Would you explore more ambitious creative concepts? This is the promotion AI is offering.

# Automating the Tedious, Not the Talent

It is crucial to understand what AI is actually doing. It is not ""thinking"" in the human sense. It is a master of pattern recognition and data synthesis. It analyzes millions of data points to generate an output that fits a specific request. This makes it incredibly effective at certain tasks.

**Here are the areas where AI becomes your tireless assistant:**

* **Concept Exploration:** Use **generative AI tools** to produce a wide range of visual styles for a mood board in minutes, not hours.
* **Asset Generation:** Need a unique background texture or a specific icon style? Prompt an AI to create it, then refine it yourself.
* **Photo Enhancement:** Tasks like removing unwanted objects, extending backgrounds with Generative Fill, or performing complex color grading are now faster and more intuitive.
* **Layout Prototyping:** AI can suggest different layouts for a web page or a print ad, allowing you to test more options and arrive at the best solution faster.

These are not replacements for your skill. They are amplifiers. The AI provides the raw material; you provide the taste, the context, and the strategic decision-making.

# The New Premium: Why Your 'Human' Skills Are More Valuable Than Ever

As AI automates technical execution, the skills that truly differentiate you become more valuable than ever. These are the abilities that cannot be programmed or replicated by an algorithm. They are the core of what makes a designer truly great.

What are these ""human-only"" skills?

* **Empathy:** The ability to understand a user's needs, a client's fears, and an audience's desires. AI can analyze data, but it cannot feel empathy.
* **Strategic Thinking:** The capacity to see the bigger picture, to connect a design choice to a business goal, and to build a brand that resonates on a cultural level.
* **Storytelling:** Weaving a narrative through visuals, words, and interactions that creates an emotional connection. AI can generate assets, but you are the storyteller.
* **Taste and Curation:** The refined judgment to know which of the hundred AI-generated options is the right one. Your taste is your unique, un-automatable signature.
* **Ethical Judgment:** Navigating the complex moral questions around design, from accessibility to representation to the responsible use of technology itself.

Your career's future security lies not in being a better technician than an AI, but in being a more empathetic, strategic, and insightful human.

# Your New Toolkit in Action: Adobe Firefly for Designers

To make this less abstract, let's look at a practical tool built for this new reality: Adobe Firefly. It is designed to integrate directly into the workflow you already know within **AI tools in Adobe Creative Cloud**.

Imagine you are designing a campaign for a new coffee brand. In the past, you would spend hours searching for stock photos of coffee beans, steam, and cozy cafes. Now, using text-to-image in Firefly, you can prompt: ""A cinematic shot of a single drop of espresso splashing into a white ceramic cup, warm morning light, macro detail."" You get a unique, commercially safe image in seconds.

But the real magic happens next. As the creative director, you are not done. You take that image into Photoshop, use Generative Fill to extend the background, adjust the colors to match the brand palette, and integrate it into your layout. You used AI for speed and ideation, but your skill and taste provided the final, polished result. This is **how to use AI for design** effectively—as a partner in creation.

# The Conductor's Responsibility: Championing Ethical Design AI

With great power comes great responsibility. As the director of this new creative process, you are also the chief ethics officer. Using AI responsibly is non-negotiable. This is where the foundation of your tools matters.

Adobe Firefly is trained on a library of licensed Adobe Stock content and public domain work, making it commercially safe. This commitment to **ethical design AI** is crucial. It ensures you are not building your work on the uncredited labor of other artists.

Your ethical responsibilities include:

* **Transparency:** Be clear with clients about where and how AI was used in the process.
* **Originality:** Use AI to augment your unique vision, not to generate a final product untouched by human hands.
* **Accountability:** You are ultimately responsible for the final output, including its quality, impact, and integrity.

# Your Promotion is Waiting

The narrative of fear around **AI in design** is compelling, but it is ultimately a distraction. The real story is one of evolution and empowerment. The mundane tasks that once consumed your days are being automated, clearing the path for you to step into a more strategic and visionary role.

The future does not belong to designers who can out-perform an algorithm at technical tasks. It belongs to those who can direct a suite of powerful tools to solve complex problems and create meaningful human experiences. It belongs to the creative directors, the storytellers, and the strategists.

The tools are ready. The promotion is yours for the taking. Are you ready to step into your new role?

The anxiety leading up to it was pretty bad and made me hold off for quite some time. I also was obsessively stalking this group and other wegovy Facebook groups. I finally realized the only way I’d know how it would effect ME is to take it. 

Now the anxiety of “when will this make me feel nauseous” or “how much coffee should I be drinking right now” is constantly on my mind. I’m somewhat prepared knowing this very well might happen so I have some nausea meds and I only drank one coffee this morning vs my normal 3 cups. I have a protein shake to sip on this morning and I’ve filled up a few different water bottles to leave around my house and car (ADHD,keeping track one one bottle would just be too much haha)

I know a lot of trial and error will be occurring over the next few weeks so I’m excited & anxiously awaiting it all .

1lgw882,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1lgw882/is_it_normal_to_not_get_any_help_from_external/,Is it normal to not get any help from external factors? [Long],"I (23M) have troubles overall with life meaning and so on. I tried working out, focusing on jobs, study, even thought I am just depressed, and got diagnosed with a mild severe case. Sat for half a year on Sertraline 50mg. Due to circumstances I haven't taken it for half a month and think i will just quit since I can not measure any effect. I tried CBT, therapy and so on, felt completely useless, especially since the therapists themselves always act too caring which is kind of disturbing. But that is a different story, since I don't like being cared for.

Even simple things like coffee, they don't affect my focus or numb my exhaustion, I drink it for taste only, same with energy drinks. I also take Levothyroxine for underworking thyroid, but apart ""maybe"" some effect of losing weight a bit easier, I don't see that medicine and having my TSH and FT4 within norms affecting me any other way. Nothing really ever changes the way I feel. Could it be because I don't let them?

Could it be possible that it's just my mind and the way it grew adapting to the world situation making me not able to fit within ""normal"" society expectations? and i am just different and looking for external ways to fix this? I find that I kind of feel best when I say what I truly think, but that always makes others instantly aggressive towards me in various ways. Especially if I challenge their world views with examples and tell them they're wrong, even when I'm diplomatic and look for a middle ground, even if I say we stay with our separate opinions, unless I agree with them they're on the offensive.

There's like barely a couple people that I ever can truly talk with that understand all sides of every situation, benefits and negatives, usually my close friends only, no other relative or any acquaintance. And I am not necessarily that antisocial or anything, I seem so but it is because I got used to not interacting, since it makes little sense most of the time. I know this feels arrogant, as if I think I am ""higher"" than them, but I can not sit on multiple chairs can I? I try to be humble, compassionate, empathetic and it all results in nothing. Is that my issue, I can't find my place because I just don't blatantly cut off people that bring me down with them? I often think about overall societal improvements methods, benefits, ways of conduct to make the world better, and feel like I am trying to analyse multiple steps ahead before forming an opinion, but the complications of this puts off people and makes me feel alienated. 

It's as if my best place would be to either live in a forest, or become sort of a shadow ruler that slowly changes the world without others realising, hopefully for the better since I can not promise how that would go, people change, and usually for the worse. Or basically a politician, but that has little impact when trying to be genuine, and especially if you don't have sketchy monetary supplies for your ideas.

I like life simple where it has to be, and complicated with important matters. It seems to me everyone is doing it the wrong way, complicating daily life for no reason and not caring about what happens in 5 years time, to them or anyone around them.

Keep in mind this in 130° heat at anywhere between 120 mph and 240mph for 90 minutes straight.

The second is from the playbook of the Boise St football team (a very talented program). For *one particular* running play, all 11 players had to know *all of the possible options* should the play be changed (audible).

…..

Does this mean that all F1 drivers and all college football players are super-geniuses?  I mean, perhaps. But methinks it’s more about how the brain can do some truly amazing things. 

This post is for those who might be feeling understandably overwhelmed by their LSAT studies. How in the world can people possibly learn everything taught in books like The Loophole, The Trainer, or PowerScore? And don’t even get me started on all of the curriculum in the different courses.

Ignore the voice in your head coming from the lazy part of your brain saying that there’s no possible way you can learn all of this stuff. This 92-year-old woman claimed she didn’t know how to play a particular piece on the piano: https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/s/vedmzA2RaU

Which truly amazing about this video is *not* the fact that her brain in fact knew how to play this piece. What’s almost miraculous is that somehow, she had the hand strength to play such a difficult piece. Even experts don’t know exactly how this can be.

A musical genius who only occasionally plays the piano wouldn’t be able to play this piece - they wouldn’t have the hand strength for it. But somehow, a 92-year-old woman does? Good chance she has trouble grasping a cup of coffee.

It’s one thing for her brain to remember the musical piece. It’s an entirely different thing for her brain to somehow enable her hands to physically play the piece. 

…..

All to reiterate the point that as long as it’s put to work, the brain can do some amazing things. 

Be patient with yourself. Force yourself to work hard, but don’t punish yourself when you don’t get to where you want to be. Have faith that with enough practice, things will come naturally. Granted, that practice might take a long time. 

Stay resilient. Absorb the punishment that will almost definitely come your way and come out the better for it. 

….

By the way, lawyers can do some pretty amazing things themselves. In fact, the work they do can leave the LSAT in the dust.

Check out this “Clause” from a federal statute known as title 42 dealing with patent disputes among pharmaceutical companies. The LSAT *wishes* it could write in such a convoluted way.

42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(5)(B)(ii) 

Translation: Title 42, Section 262, Subsection l, Paragraph 5, Subparagraph B, Clause ii

*The reference product sponsor may not include more patents on its final list than are included on the applicant’s final list (except that if the applicant’s final list contains no patents, then the sponsor’s final list may contain not more than one patent).*

…….

I can hear the objections now: *What about the timing issue on the LSAT? Reading these statutes is an untimed exercise.*

Mmmmm. This small little paragraph is part of what I believe to be a 12 page statute. Suppose reading that paragraph at one’s leisure takes 15 minutes. That means reading the entire page will take over an hour. That means reading the entire statue will take well over 12 hours. 

In other words, it’s impossible to read this stuff at one’s leisure. There’s not enough time in the universe.

…..

In the end, I tell all of my students to *embrace the chaos*. Your brain won’t like that very much, at least initially. But remember, it’s just being lazy. Put it to work, embrace the chaos, and go get what’s rightfully yours.",1,1750510983.0,LSAT,0,1.0,False

1lgvzzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1lgvzzq/i_had_an_epiphany_last_tuesday/,I Had An Epiphany Last Tuesday!,"I quit my in-office retail management job a little over three years ago and took a hybrid role way closer to home but with a huge pay cut. I support a family of four so it’s been rough but I see them way more. I get to WFH several days of the week, saving me the gas, time on the road, and the hassle of finding parking on-site. Not having to worry too much about how I look has been nice except the times we have Teams meetings and are expected to be on camera. I’ll run a brush through my hair and throw a cardigan over my pajamas. Here’s the flip side that few consider until the damage is done. If you WFH in most cases you’re glued to a screen 6-8 hours a days with a few breaks scattered in where you grab coffee, a shower, play with your dog, run an errand (or a few), and what not. You can sit and you can stand but sitting or standing in one place for hours a day wreaks havoc on your body, specifically your back and discs. You literally have to go out of your way every single day to combat the damage a desk job does to your body. I’ll be the first to admit, I didn’t for the past three years I’ve been at this job. In my last job, I was on my feet and moving around ALL day, I was lean and flexible with few if any chronic pain issues- even in my early to mid forties, both of my pregnancies I worked right up until the last few days. 
My epiphany happened this past Tuesday. I saw that a company I’ve wanted to work for years was hiring, from the profession I left three years ago. I managed to score an interview and by the time the interview ended I realized, not only was the pay and benefits incredible like a HUGE increase over what I’m making now but it was active! I managed to throw my back out last October and have been suffering from horrible lower back pain and sciatica for over six months now that I know I probably would not have had happen had I not taken a sedentary desk job. Out of transparency I did mention I had some mobility issues in the interview. I also needed to obtain a new certification that was recently made mandatory in my profession. Unfortunately I feel like my mobility issues and lack of this certification made me a less than ideal candidate so I doubt I’ll hear back from them despite a great interview and dialogue. Disappointing because they are NEVER hiring so it’s possible they may never be looking for someone again in my lifetime. Which is unfortunate because I believe leaving this horrible soul sucking corporate joke of a company and working in a role where I’d be active again may actually be the key to healing my back/disc issues. 
It’s sadly ironic it took THIS interview for me to realize that if I continue my WFH/ desk job I will probably die an early death and continue to have increasing health issues. And unfortunately this was the ONE company that offered the perfect blend of what I need in my life, close to home, incredible pay, incredible benefits, and in a physical environment I could only thrive in. I hope whoever they select appreciates what a lottery they’ve won. The moral of my story is, if you continue your WFH scenario enjoy and appreciate the freedoms you have, I mean, it is nice. Just don’t lose sight of the repercussions of this kind of a job. It only took three years for me to reap the consequences of my inactivity. ",2,1750510786.0,remotework,1,0.75,False
1lgvzzk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lgvzzk,Update on the 100mah battery,"So yesterday I decided to see I could could find a battery here localy in Colombia while I wait for the 5 pack I oredered from aliexpress. By miracle I found a small electronic shop that had them for $3.00 so i headed over and bought one. Right away I realisied they are way bigger the than 40mah the C71 C72 come with. Yes 40mah not 75. The gen1 mini comes with a 75mah but I guess since the rx7 body although longer and wider than the the mini, is not as tall. I dont own and mini and I dont have a 75mah, so I dont know if the 75 will fit a c71?

So i took the car and battery accross the street the phone repair shop and the guy charged me a cup of coffee to solder it. I own a soldering gun but these guys are pros and they have microscopes.

He soldered the the battery and the car finally turned on. Ptoblem 1 solved.

Now I need a body. Luckily I own a 3d printwr so I went to work. I found a few cars already designed for the c71 chassis so I boutght the stl files for $5.00 each. All I did was make the car a bit taller in cura and after a few broken cars"" trying to get supports off"" and measuring I got it to fit.

Yes I know it looks like shit but my sons Nday party is today and I wanted to have all 7 cars running for the soccer match so I didnt sand or prep. I just painted. 

The ones I oresered from ali are 90mah so Maybe a bit smaller. If you can find a 75mah I would go with that.",2,1750510786.0,turboracing,0,0.75,False
1lgvzg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lgvzg3/my_girlfriend_f22_of_2_years_left_me_m22_wanted/,"My girlfriend (F22) of 2 years left me (M22), wanted to fix things 3 weeks later but didn't tell me she slept with someone else at the time. Am I insane for being so attached to something that happened outside the relationship?","FYI this situation ocurred 2 years ago. I've had mental ups and downs because of it, but recently it's been consuming me so much that I needed to get it off my chest.

My girlfriend and I were together for 2 years. It was my first relationship and her second (her first relationship sounded incredibly toxic). Things were great at the start, but after some time I think we got too comfortable. We were both people pleasers and the relationship didn't have much identity. We both conformed to each others needs, and for me, having had no previous experience in relationships, I felt this was the norm. In the later stages of our relationship, I found myself comfortable and a little bored. I was pretty distant and questioned if this girl was really my person. I was always kind, loyal and supportive, but to be honest at this stage I don't know if I was passionate about the relationship anymore.

One day, after what felt out of the blue, she said she needed time apart, that my communication skills were not enough for her. That we never argued and that she didn't know me deeply enough. While she never used the word breakup, it felt like it, and I didn't want to ask because hearing the word would kill me. Instead I asked ""have you made up your mind"" and she broke down in tears. She left and mentioned meeting for a coffee after a few weeks when things had cleared up.

3 weeks later she wants to meet for a coffee. After a 20 minute conversation, everything is cleared up. I knew what she needed from me and was willing to work on it. I feel like she was right to confront me on my communication skills, it was a self defense mechanism from the way I was raised that had no place in a relationship. So the relationship was back on, I was optimistic and excited.

What she failed to mention to me was that she slept with someone else at a party during those 3 weeks apart. I randomly decided to ask if she had been with anyone during that time days later and finding out broke me in such a human way. I guess I didn't have the time to fully detach from the relationship because the word breakup was never used combined with the fact it had only been 3 weeks and that I had fully let my guard down to her already. I was so mentally hurt and disturbed by it all. I gather I had the emotional response of cheating because I hadn't mentally checked out of the relationship. She was clear that it meant nothing to her, it was an impulsive decision made in heartbreak and that it had no bearing on our relationship.

I really tried to make things work. I never got angry with her, I just communicated how deeply it affected me and how I felt about the safety and intimacy of our relationship. I felt completely devalued and betrayed. I never had a meaningless sexual encounter and sex carried alot of meaning for me. After about a month of struggle, she mentioned giving me a ""pass"" to personally experience a meaningless sexual encounter. As much as I regret it now, I used the ""pass"" and it felt like putting a plaster over a gaping wound. In essence it didn't fix any of the problems, it only added guilt to the situation. Shortly after this she left me again because she had enough problems going on in her life, and that fact that me using the ""pass"" was worse than what she did because we were actively trying to fix things. I was so emotionally confused.

In the coming months I reached out to meet up but she said it was too soon for her, set a later date that she would reach out and she failed to do so. About 8 months afer this, she comes to my friends party (my friend recently started dating her friend). In these 8 months I had worked on moving on with my life, she wanted out of the relationship and that was ok. I knew it was going to be hard to see her, but it would still be nice, we weren't on bad terms or anything. What I wasn't expecting was for her to pull me outside tell me that I had always been her person and would I be willing to try things again. What bothered me however is how she said she barely remembered the entire breakup and the whole situation, something that affected me so deeply. I took some time to think and decided at the time because I was going to be travelling an awful lot shortly after, then be moving away for 3 months, and the lack of any feeling whatsoever from all the hurt caused by the complicated breakup that I wasn't up for continuing the relationship.

Now today, I'm in a place where the relationship could continue, but I can't decide if its worth pursuing. Part of me feels like I'm the bad guy for not being a communicative enough boyfriend, and for being so upset with something that technically happened outside the relationship, and which she made clear had no burden on the relationship. The other part of me feels like it's just all too complicated, and all the evidence above just proves that we are not compatible, not good for each other. I'm not sure if we are genuinely incompatible, or did I take her for granted.

I would really appreciate any outside advice on what I should do, be as harsh and critical as you would like, I need to hear it. I don't know if this whole situation would make the relationship stronger, or would it just add resentment.",13,1750510736.0,relationship_advice,23,0.81,False

I haven't been able to make a difference there. Most have ignored my application, several got back to me but are not in current need of volunteers (which just boggles my mind). One organization failed to utilize my talents after many meetings and months of wasted time.

I have contacted my representatives about pretty much everything. 

I have gone to several protests, including my very first at the age of 38. 

I have in general slowed down my social media and news intake. 

I only read news when I'm fully awake now instead of with coffee like I did for 20 years...

I have attended a bunch of trans support groups. 

My gender expression lacks in many ways. But lately I wear a few articles of clothing with the trans colors or outright flag. 

My proudest moment? Walking away from an idiot. 

This dude asked me without any resistance, ""what rights have been taken away from you?"" 

I just said I didnt have the time for this and walked away. 

The look of pure rejection on his face has been lighting my heart for months.

I've come to personally believe a lot of republican woes are caused by isolation and loneliness. 

Being angry and crazy the way they are brings them the attention they sorely need. 

When you ignore that crazy, it takes away their instinct to further engage with it.

In essence, I've really had to decide what is and isn't worth my time these days.

It sucks but I need to keep up hope.

Every time i visit a new doctor she takes complete blood work of all hormones which everytime comes normal, only in last ultrasound there were small cysts, otw never , always the ultrasound came clean. 

I even wished I swear that I'd have thyroid so I would finally have an explanation and would treat symptoms but thyroid, prolactin, testosterone always came clear. 

I haven't been to any doctor in the last two years
Three years back I went to her a top endocrinologist she said to take diane 35 as for a long time I havent had any period and come later

>This is the dynamic life state of the Buddhist spirit of “true cause”—of always moving forward from this moment on—a life state that is ever new, ever strong, and ever dedicated. It is what the Daishonin means when he says, “Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is just such a ‘diligent’ practice.” 

>Why does the Soka Gakkai always brim with a vibrant spirit of growth and development? Because its members—men, women, young, and old—embody this unflagging seeking spirit in faith. They embody the courage to challenge their human revolution and work for kosen-rufu.

Also i know work friends are just work friends so maybe it’s not that deep too…

In my workplace, me and my colleagues get along very well and talk and share about our lives, family etc. One of my female colleagues (im female too) who is technically in a senior position and is older and i got pretty close when we started working together. We would have lunch, she would check in with me and i had a hard time with starting out a new role where she gave me support (as she had been in the same position and understood the struggles). I shared a little bit as well about my relationship struggles (as that had impacted my work at times).

At some point last fall, i felt a weird distance from her. She didn’t really acknowledge me, if we’re in a group having a group conversation, and if i was talking about something, she wouldn’t look at me. I went to her department couple of times during busy shifts to ask if i could help out which she would just brush me off and say no, i’m fine. With other colleagues, she’s all smiles and “good morning!!”. With me she stopped.

I approached her on this, was everything ok? Did i do something wrong? She said no, i’m overthinking it, we’re all good. I found out she’s been having some health issues. Ok, i understood, i asked her to please let me know if i can do anything, i do care and am happy to help where i can.

It seemed…ok for a while. Nothing like we were before fall but it seemed we were cordial and friendly. It did feel like a real step back from how we were.

Spring came around, i had a bad anxiety attack (with some relationship issues in the background) at work and had to speak to her as she was managing the work schedule those weeks. She was very supportive, checked in on me etc. She knew i was under stress at work and we all talked about job roles etc which i was going to bring it up with another manager when he was back from his leave.

She went for a vacation and came back with all smiles and had a sit down with me about relationship concerns she had for me which i thanked her for and reassured the relationship has improved (my partner and i went for couple’s counselling for months and it brought us to a stronger better place). I remember the look she gave me - like i was far gone in her eyes. She ended it with “if you ever need me im here”. 

Anyways since then..it’s distance again. She knew i had massive amounts of work on my side and my colleagues checked in to see if i could help (whereas she had very little on her side) but she never came by to just say hi.

She would go for coffee, lunch with our other colleagues who would by extension ask if i was free to do so but never her (as she did before).
It was like if she didn’t need me for work related matters (like to inform me of something over the phone), she wouldn’t even attempt to communicate (hi, hello, need a hand). 
Sitting in the same room even, it feels difficult, i can sense she doesn’t like i’m there (same as last fall, i joined the group for lunch and she left early). I stopped joining them for lunch/coffee/breaks in the break room because it just felt so..icy.

What hurts is, i really did appreciate her support and friendship. I’m not the type of work friend that’s like “lets go for a massive hike on Saturday after work” but the type to send you funny memes on instagram, buy you your favourite coffee on your worst days and help you by helping you with your work. I get along with all my other colleagues and even when we didn’t have nice days, we still acknowledged each other.

I shared some work audit project i did on our whatsapp work group (which we do) and she messaged in the group (not me personally) and wrote as if my audit was claiming the team wasn’t doing a good job (eventhough the results were good and there were very few recommendations). I texted her about it and she said she just thought i should have emailed it formally to everyone (which most don’t check their work emails often anyways so our manager sends reminder etc through our whatsapp group). Fair enough i get that it’s better off in an email…but why didn’t she approach me directly? Send me a text personally? Also i’d been cluing the team in about the audit updates through whatsapp, why couldn’t see approach me at the start to say “hey! Maybe take everything via email”
This happened in the span of the last few months too.

I feel hurt but i know if i approach her again, she’s going to say i’m overthinking it again. 

I don’t think she likes the way i work, i don’t think she agrees with my relationship, i also think she (single) found my partner on dating apps (we’re trying ENM- but not something i talk about openly) and likely does not agree with this, i think she knows i’m stressed at work and likely feels she does not want to further support me so keeps a distance at work? 
I also realized she doesn’t like some people at work and she’s treating me how she treats them.
Even if she disagrees with my choices, does she need to ignore my existence except only when unavoidable? Is that better than saying she doesn’t agree with my choices, she feels uncomfortable, is there if i really do need help, but would not like to discuss personal matters at work? 
Or just staying cordial? It’s not that we see each other daily (we work shifts) or that we HAVE to talk about our most difficult moments during lunch? Why is having just a coffee talking about each other’s weekends or hobbies so difficult? I’ve now started to opt to have a different lunch time/break from everyone else when she’s in (as they have it in a group) just because i feel the ice in the room.

So anyway, she threw this little “surprise party” for me last weekend. My birthday was last Tuesday, but she insisted on celebrating Friday. She told me to dress cute, and she made it sound like it was gonna be this wholesome wine-and-charcuterie night with the girls. Sounds great, right?

Well, I show up in this cute white dress I literally bought for the occasion, hair curled, nails done, all that. I walk in and they yell surprise, but not in a “we love you” way. It was a theme party. The theme? “Dress like the birthday girl and roast her.” I kid you not.

EVERYONE was wearing versions of my go-to outfits. Messy bun, iced coffee cups, fake nails, bad parking tickets taped to their bags (okay that one kinda got me). But then they started doing fake ""toasts"" that were just jabs. Like:

“Here’s to \[my name\], who always has a 10-step skincare routine but still wakes up looking tired.”

“To \[my name\], who thinks astrology is a personality trait.”

“To \[my name\], who ghosted her gym membership but never forgets to DoorDash McFlurries at 2AM.”

Like??? Some of it was funny, I’ll admit, but after 20 minutes it just got mean. I kept smiling through it like “haha good one” but deep down I was like... damn. This wasn’t a roast with love. It was just people clowning on me for sport.

So after pretending to go to the bathroom, I grabbed my keys, quietly told Jenna “I think I’m done for the night,” and left. I didn’t cause a scene. I didn’t cry. I just left. I texted her later that I appreciated the effort, but it felt more like I was the butt of the joke, not the guest of honor.

Now Jenna’s mad and saying I embarrassed her, and that “it was just jokes,” and I’m being “too sensitive.” A few of the others messaged me saying they thought I overreacted and that it was “all in fun.” But like... isn’t a birthday supposed to feel good? Not like a Comedy Central special?

So tell me, AITAH for walking out of my own roast disguised as a birthday party?

Also for the record, I’m now officially Team “Next Year I’m Celebrating With Pizza And My Cat.”

*NTA. Ironic she wants to claim anything about being embarassed. That none of your ""friends"" care the humor got stale and are continuing to pile on rather than reflect, well, are they even friends or do they even like you?*

>OOP: Right?? That’s what’s been messing with my head the most. Like… if this is their idea of “fun” or “love,” I’d honestly hate to see what their version of shade looks like. I kept thinking maybe I was being too sensitive, but the fact that not one person said “hey maybe this is going too far” kinda says it all.

>It felt like I walked into a group chat where they’ve been secretly roasting me for months and accidentally read the whole thing out loud.

>Still debating if I should fade out or hit them with a group message titled “Roast This” and attach a pic of me on a solo spa weekend.

*I think your group chat comment is a great way to describe it. Having been a younger woman, I think many of us can learn misperceptions about what is funny and how ""roasting"" plays into relationships - or rather how it makes them unhealthy. ""I guess we don't share the same sense of humor, which is Ok. What isn't Ok is that I said I wasn't enjoying it and instead of realizing it or accepting that, you just keep invalidating what I am saying. It's disappointing."" And then your idea of ghosting may be best. The more you fight or try to explain, they will likely weaponize it and say you are so dramatic, so why give them more ammunition? Why allow yourself to be dismissed more than they have? I promise you, one of the most powerful things you can do - even though it may not seem like it - is to just stay quiet. It freaks people out and they don't know how to handle it.*

Hey everyone! Wow, I did not expect this much love and support. I’ve been reading through your comments (like, obsessively tbh), and I can’t even tell you how comforting it’s been. I thought I was crazy or being “too sensitive” like Jenna said, but apparently I was just reacting like a normal human with, y’know, feelings. So THANK YOU.

So here’s what happened since I posted:

Jenna texted me. Not to apologize… but to send me a meme that said “roasting is a love language” with a laughing emoji. I left her on read because... girl. Seriously?

Later that night, one of the girls from the party (we’ll call her Becca) DM’d me and said she thought I knew about the roast. She said Jenna told everyone I was totally down for it and even “helped plan it.” I was like, WHAT?! The only thing I “planned” was the white dress I wore while being emotionally shanked by six girls in fake Uggs.

Anyway, I gently explained to Becca that nope, I was blindsided. And she immediately apologized and said she felt really bad. She even said if she’d known, she never would’ve gone along with it. So that honestly made me feel a bit better, at least one of them has a soul.

As for Jenna? Radio silence since the meme. No apology, no “hey I messed up,” nothing. So I’ve decided I’m not gonna chase people to value me. My new plan? I took a personal day, got myself a mini spa package, ate overpriced macarons, and spent my night with my cat binge-watching ""The Bear"" while wearing a gold face mask like I was healing from battle (because emotionally, I kinda was).

I’ve realized this whole thing was actually a weird gift. I got roasted, yes. But I also got clarity. I thought I had a solid group of friends, turns out I had a front row seat to my own roast hosted by people who think “mean but make it Pinterest” is a cute party idea.

So yeah. Next year, it’s just me, my cat, a pizza the size of a steering wheel, and zero surprises. And you know what? That honestly sounds perfect.

Thanks again for validating my gut feeling. Y’all really helped me feel seen.

I (19M) have fallen deeply for this girl at my university. “Like” feels too small a word — I genuinely love her.

We were in different classes from the start, so I never had the chance to talk to her properly until we ended up coordinating the same event at our university. We also anchored together for that event, and that’s where our bond started to grow. From there, things really took off. We were spending time together almost every day — going out, laughing, having real conversations. She seemed genuinely happy.

Especially during that time — the event coordination and exams — we would go out all the time. Coffee, food, just spending hours together. I always paid whenever we went out. And even though it hit me sometimes — “Is she coming out with me because I’m paying?” — if I’m being honest, I genuinely think she was happy about coming out with me. I just wanted her to feel better.

When exams came around, we studied together (not in person but over texts and calls), and I was always there for her. During this time, her ex suddenly reached out, apologizing and saying he missed her. She told me about their past — how she had put in so much effort into the relationship, how she got emotionally exhausted, and how he once shouted at her saying, “I never wanted this, I was just with you out of pity.” That crushed her. But I stood by her through it all. I supported her mentally, kept her company, took her out when she was down. I was doing everything someone who loves a person would do.

At one point, she told me she was over him. “I’ve removed him from my heart,” she said. I believed her. I trusted her words. I never made any moves because I didn’t want to risk our bond. I just stayed close and made sure she felt cared for.

She used to tell me things that felt meaningful. She said she doesn’t care about looks, that what matters is someone who makes her feel safe and happy. I genuinely thought that’s what I was doing for her.

Then we had a three-week break from college. During that time, we barely spoke. I don’t know what happened — maybe life got in the way, or maybe we just didn’t have anything to talk about. But it felt distant. After the break, once college resumed, things seemed normal again. I was still picking her up, dropping her off at her hostel near campus like before. (For context: she stays in a hostel near the college and goes home on weekends. Her uncle usually comes to pick her up when she goes home.)

We weren’t talking a lot during college hours, but we still went out a few more times. But something had changed. After every hangout, she would go silent on the way back. She looked sad, lost in thought. I didn’t know what I was doing wrong. One day I asked her if I was the problem — if I was making her uncomfortable. She told me she was going through a lot and that I shouldn’t be affected. She said, “We’re just friends. We don’t have to be emotionally dependent on each other.” That hurt. Aren’t friends supposed to be there emotionally too?

Around that same time, she opened up one evening and told me that she doesn’t want to let anyone get too deep into her life — because eventually, they all leave. She even admitted that during the break, she kept me out on purpose. She didn’t want to talk, didn’t want to open up. I didn’t say anything back, but that stayed with me. It hurt, because I thought we had something real.

In the middle of all this, she told me something else: “My friends think you might have a slight crush on me.” I panicked. I didn’t want to lose her. So I denied it. I told her I didn’t — even though I was deeply in love with her. She said, “I hope that’s true.” And just like that, I locked away all my feelings.

And then… her ex came back again. She told me about it and even asked me if she should get back with him. I wanted to scream no — he had hurt her so badly before. But I just said, “It’s your decision.”

Then she said something that hit me harder than anything: “I’d go through it all again. He’s tall and has pretty eyes.” That stung. Not because of how he looks — but because she had told me she was past him. She had said she had removed him from her heart. That she didn’t love him anymore. And now suddenly she was saying, “I loved him.” Like none of those words from before ever mattered.

And during this same time, she was being chased by a couple of other guys too. Guys who were texting her constantly, trying to get her attention, wanting her to date them. She told me it was overwhelming — that it was all too much. And I could see it. She was emotionally exhausted. She looked it every time we met.

Eventually, she decided to get back together with her ex. He told her things would be different — that he’d be “the giver” this time. I wanted to believe he meant it. I really did. But from what I saw, nothing’s really changed.

Just the other day, we were having coffee at the campus cafeteria, and he walked past us. She called out to him, and he didn’t even turn around. Later she asked him why, and he just brushed it off with, “I’ll meet you at lunch, right?” That upset her. She was quiet after that.

That evening, I waited for her call like always — to pick her up and drop her back to the hostel. It never came. I called her and she said, “I’m already on my way home.” I just said okay and ended the call. But while I was heading back, I saw her with him. She saw me too — I’m sure of it. I later texted her asking, “Did your uncle pick you up?” She replied, “Yeah.” She lied to me — for the first time. And that crushed me.

I don’t know what to do anymore.
Should I stay friends with her and pretend like none of this affects me?
Should I open up and tell her how I feel — even if it risks everything?
Should I ask her why she lied to me?
Or should I just walk away completely?

Because right now, it feels like I’m slowly breaking from the inside, quietly, every day.",2,1750510204.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's be honest, we all at some point of our life had some kind of skin issue, whether its acne, eczema or just a pimple here and there.

This is not normal or natural, we are supposed to have clear skin from the time we are born till death ideally, ofcourse nowadays that is almost impossible for someone to achieve, but if youre struggling with your skin, I hope these practical tips will solve your issue.  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Acne:

When I was 14 years old I went to Turkey with my family for 2 weeks on holidays, The food at the hotel were lets say mediocre for your health, there was a buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner, ofcourse i wasnt peating back then so i just ate whatever was infront of me, eggs and bread for breakfast, fries and ice cream for lunch and spaghetti bologenese for dinner, i was struggling with acne at that time but just one week being there my skin almost completely cleared up.

\[Don't use this as an excuse to eat junk\]

That is because it was 40° degrees outside and i was tanning and staying in the sun for hours. I see the sun as a natural laser that erases your pimples and gives you that healthy glow. It must have something to do with the UV Rays itself but I also contribute its qualities to the Vitamin D that you produce.

I must have have eaten well over 3500 calories a day, but at the end i actually lost weight, the vitamin D really gives your body a hard time putting on weight, combine that with low stress overall (thus low cortisol) and its practically impossible.

Now going back home ofcourse the acne was coming back and i was gaining the weight i lost back again.

Living here in germany we maybe have 2-4 weeks of good sun exposure in a year, so its not suprising, but I wasnt able to connect the dots back then.

1.5 years later at 15 and a half i got into peating and at first it made my acne worse than it ever was, i was eating way too much ice cream than i should have and it was winter, not a good combo, I was contemplating to switching to a carnivore diet, but i really wanted to give peating a shot cause i like my carbs.

So i listened to podcasts with ray.

""but did you say carini bacterium as in the bacteria that cause acne? And carcinogenesis? Yes. \[...\] So Dr. Peat, did you get the question there? Yeah, I think thyroid and vitamin D are major factors in the immunity (of acne).""

When i heard this it hit me, how could i have not thought of Vitamin D!

I immediately bought the vitamin d3+k2 supplement from thorne research (danny roddy's recommendation).

But pay attention now;

""I got interested in vitamin A because I found that every time I worked outside in the summer, I got acne. And people had told me that sunlight (the vitamin d resulting from it) was good for the skin, but I invariably got acne in proportion to my exposure to sunlight, and I figured it was some toxic effect of ultraviolet light. 

But then one night I went to sleep reading with a very bright light shining in my face and slept eight hours with that light just a foot and a half from my eyes and woke up starting to get pimples.

And I suddenly realized that it was activating not only my retinal vitamin A system, but via my eyes it was activating my hormonal system and consuming vitamin A. And I found that in proportion to my sun exposure or light exposure, if I increased the vitamin A, I could prevent acne and it turns out to be protective in other ways."" - Peat

  
So you should also get vitamin A, because Vitamin D and A seem to antagonize each other in some ways. via. liver that you ideally should be consuming twice a week, you can prevent this, so thats what i was doing aswell.

Simultaneously i was removing some excess fat out of my diet, mainly reducing my ice cream consumption and switching out fatty meat with leaner cuts.

""Any kind of fat in excess (I'd say no more than 25% of your diet) will disturb your skin energy production. And for any cell, its functions decrease under the influence of fat that doesen't trigger."" - Peat

Within weeks my skin cleared up again, it was such a relief, you just dont look worse, sick and unhealthy, but it's also super annoying especially if its itchy which it was in my case.

Now at 17 I can safely say that I was cured all right.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Eczema

Thankfully something i never had to deal with, its caused by inflammation tied to reduced energy metabolism.

Similarily to Acne, Vit D3 especially in combination with K2 help like magic.

  
""[So I've fixed my eczema for the past 4 months by eating Ray's way and more importantly adding VIT K + D](https://lowtoxinforum.com/threads/doxycycline-impairs-oxidative-metabolism-and-causes-eczema-and-bad-skin.39891/)""



Inflammation can radiate systemically, via histamine and immune signaling, when skin cells (or any cells) are inflamed, they're essentially under-energized and over-stressed and this state triggers immune signals, including histamine, nitric oxide, serotonin, prostaglandins, and cytokines, that don’t stay confined to one area.

  
People have seen great results using pregnenalone and progesterone for eczema, for example:

""[I used to have eczema every winter. I tried some pregnenolone and progesterone last winter and it went away quite quickly.](https://lowtoxinforum.com/threads/the-eczema-thread.40710/)""

  
That is because of their histamine, serotonin, nitric oxide, prostaglandins reducing effects. 

These foods/drinks could lead to you developing higher levels of histamine (and serotonin) through bacterial decarboxylation of amino acids:

* Aged cheeses
* Cured meats (salami, bacon, ham)
* Sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha
* Soy sauce, miso, tamari
* Wine, beer, champagne
* Vinegar-containing products

  
""Fermentation produces amines like histamine and serotonin, which can aggravate inflammatory conditions and impair metabolism.” - Peat

  
Other following foods could promote endotoxin or the production of histamine aswell:

* Tomatoes
* Spinach
* Strawberries
* Avocado
* Eggplant
* Citrus (for some people)

These foods are generally low histamine and anti-inflammatory:

* Freshly cooked, red meat (beef or lamb, lean cuts)
* Egg yolks (yolks are protective, whites can be allergenic for some)
* Fresh fruits: oranges (if tolerated, not tart or bitter tasting ones), papaya, mango, cherimoyas
* Raw carrot salad daily (binds endotoxin, lowers estrogen)
* Dairy: milk, cottage cheese, low-histamine cheeses like fresh ricotta
* Coffee with sugar and milk (anti-histamine, pro-metabolic)
* Coconut oil (anti-endotoxin, almost no PUFA)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Psoriasis

Psoriasis is a condition related to the imbalance of thyroid and estrogen. When metabolism is suppressed, and estrogen dominates, it promotes inflammation and the excessive growth of skin cells. The skin becomes thick and scaly because the cells are not properly energized to function normally. 

Doing all the things above, while supplementing vitamin B1/thiamine for better energy production usually resolves the condition.

  
mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired cellular energy are part of the problem, so adequate thiamine helps support better skin cell function and reduce abnormal proliferation.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Rosacea

Rosacea is also primarily an inflammatory condition linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, estrogen dominance, and oxidative stress.

As individuals age, mitochondrial efficiency declines, leading to increased susceptibility to stressors like UV light, which can exacerbate rosacea symptoms.

""The increased incidence of rosacea after the age of 30, and the fact that it occurs most commonly in the areas that are most exposed to sunlight (bald men sometimes develop it on the top of the head), indicate that aging and irritation are essential causes."" - Peat

  
Chronic inflammation can result in vasodilation, increased blood flow, and the formation of new blood vessels (neovascularization), contributing to the redness and swelling in rosacea.

  
""Lactic acid, produced under the influence of estrogen, nitric oxide, or other problems of energy formation, besides causing vasodilation, also stimulates the growth of fibroblasts. Oxygen deprivation, or damage to mitochondria, will increase lactic acid formation, and so it will immediately cause vasodilation, and if the problem is prolonged, new blood vessels will grow, and fibrous connective tissue will increase. Estrogen stimulates collagen synthesis, and it has been associated with a variety of inflammatory and fibrotic conditions "" - Peat

  
So, reducing PUFA (for better mitochondrial function) and Estrogen, while increasing carbon dioxide (breathing method), and supplementing vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) as well as vitamin B3 (Niacinamide).



""Riboflavin, vitamin B2, is an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, and it is very easily destroyed by light (blue light and especially ultraviolet). When it is excited by high energy light, it can spread the damage to other components of the mitochondria, including the cytochromes and the polyunsaturated fatty acids. The other B vitamins are affected when riboflavin's actions are disturbed."" - Peat



""\[...\] niacinamide can play multiple protective roles, decreasing excitation, increasing energy production, and stabilizing repair systems. The state of excitation and type of energy metabolism are crucial factors in governing cell functions and survival."" - Peat

I keep seeing these extremely high (from my standpoint) salaries here.  After a decade working in government/NFP accounting and having passed both the CPA and CFE (I'm an active CFE, but because I haven't been able to work under a CPA, I can't call myself one), I'm currently earning $70,000 per year (high cost of living).  I'm trying desperately to get into six figure positions, but I'm falling flat and I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.

I'm finding a few roles on LinkedIn that pay low $100,000 ($100,000-$120,000), but I'm even struggling to get interviews at these roles (mostly searching for controller/assistant controller).  Of the few interviews that I've had (2-3 over the past year), I've been informed by both an external recruiter and the person interviewing me that people in government are seen as lazy workers within other industries.  Further, I was actually told that because I've only managed small teams (1-2 people), they weren't really interested in moving forward.  I've also noticed a lot of roles in industry requiring very specific skillsets (ie using ABC accounting package designed for manufacturing).  The other issue that I'm finding with the roles listed on LInkedIn is that they're all really just advertisements for external recruiting firms (abc headhunters is posting the role, not the company itself).  When filtering out the external recruiting firms, there really aren't many advertised roles.

Public accounting firms won't really consider me for entry level roles because I'm not a student, but I don't have the audit experience to get into higher level roles.  Occasionally, I'll see outsourced controller roles at firms, so this might be an option.  If not for the above, I'd be fine with not going into public accounting, but I'm really trying to make more money.

I've been messaging people on LinkedIn non-stop to attempt building up my networks.  I've set up coffee meetings with a number of people.  Any advice breaking into a role that pays more money?  I'm basically in a catch-22.",6,1750509490.0,Accounting,3,1.0,False

I (19M) have fallen deeply for this girl at my university. “Like” feels too small a word — I genuinely love her.

We were in different classes from the start, so I never had the chance to talk to her properly until we ended up coordinating the same event at our university. We also anchored together for that event, and that’s where our bond started to grow. From there, things really took off. We were spending time together almost every day — going out, laughing, having real conversations. She seemed genuinely happy.

Especially during that time — the event coordination and exams — we would go out all the time. Coffee, food, just spending hours together. I always paid whenever we went out. And even though it hit me sometimes — “Is she coming out with me because I’m paying?” — if I’m being honest, I genuinely think she was happy about coming out with me. I just wanted her to feel better.

When exams came around, we studied together (not in person but over texts and calls), and I was always there for her. During this time, her ex suddenly reached out, apologizing and saying he missed her. She told me about their past — how she had put in so much effort into the relationship, how she got emotionally exhausted, and how he once shouted at her saying, “I never wanted this, I was just with you out of pity.” That crushed her. But I stood by her through it all. I supported her mentally, kept her company, took her out when she was down. I was doing everything someone who loves a person would do.

At one point, she told me she was over him. “I’ve removed him from my heart,” she said. I believed her. I trusted her words. I never made any moves because I didn’t want to risk our bond. I just stayed close and made sure she felt cared for.

She used to tell me things that felt meaningful. She said she doesn’t care about looks, that what matters is someone who makes her feel safe and happy. I genuinely thought that’s what I was doing for her.

Then we had a three-week break from college. During that time, we barely spoke. I don’t know what happened — maybe life got in the way, or maybe we just didn’t have anything to talk about. But it felt distant. After the break, once college resumed, things seemed normal again. I was still picking her up, dropping her off at her hostel near campus like before. (For context: she stays in a hostel near the college and goes home on weekends. Her uncle usually comes to pick her up when she goes home.)

We weren’t talking a lot during college hours, but we still went out a few more times. But something had changed. After every hangout, she would go silent on the way back. She looked sad, lost in thought. I didn’t know what I was doing wrong. One day I asked her if I was the problem — if I was making her uncomfortable. She told me she was going through a lot and that I shouldn’t be affected. She said, “We’re just friends. We don’t have to be emotionally dependent on each other.” That hurt. Aren’t friends supposed to be there emotionally too?

Around that same time, she opened up one evening and told me that she doesn’t want to let anyone get too deep into her life — because eventually, they all leave. She even admitted that during the break, she kept me out on purpose. She didn’t want to talk, didn’t want to open up. I didn’t say anything back, but that stayed with me. It hurt, because I thought we had something real.

In the middle of all this, she told me something else: “My friends think you might have a slight crush on me.” I panicked. I didn’t want to lose her. So I denied it. I told her I didn’t — even though I was deeply in love with her. She said, “I hope that’s true.” And just like that, I locked away all my feelings.

And then… her ex came back again. She told me about it and even asked me if she should get back with him. I wanted to scream no — he had hurt her so badly before. But I just said, “It’s your decision.”

Then she said something that hit me harder than anything: “I’d go through it all again. He’s tall and has pretty eyes.” That stung. Not because of how he looks — but because she had told me she was past him. She had said she had removed him from her heart. That she didn’t love him anymore. And now suddenly she was saying, “I loved him.” Like none of those words from before ever mattered.

And during this same time, she was being chased by a couple of other guys too. Guys who were texting her constantly, trying to get her attention, wanting her to date them. She told me it was overwhelming — that it was all too much. And I could see it. She was emotionally exhausted. She looked it every time we met.

Eventually, she decided to get back together with her ex. He told her things would be different — that he’d be “the giver” this time. I wanted to believe he meant it. I really did. But from what I saw, nothing’s really changed.

Just the other day, we were having coffee at the campus cafeteria, and he walked past us. She called out to him, and he didn’t even turn around. Later she asked him why, and he just brushed it off with, “I’ll meet you at lunch, right?” That upset her. She was quiet after that.

That evening, I waited for her call like always — to pick her up and drop her back to the hostel. It never came. I called her and she said, “I’m already on my way home.” I just said okay and ended the call. But while I was heading back, I saw her with him. She saw me too — I’m sure of it. I later texted her asking, “Did your uncle pick you up?” She replied, “Yeah.” She lied to me — for the first time. And that crushed me.

 I don’t know what to do anymore.
Should I stay friends with her and pretend like none of this affects me?
Should I open up and tell her how I feel — even if it risks everything?
Should I ask her why she lied to me?
Or should I just walk away completely?

Because right now, it feels like I’m slowly breaking from the inside, quietly, every day.",1,1750509454.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I’ve been in love with my guy best friend (27M) for the past 4 years. He’s 3 years younger than me, pero mas nauna siya sa company namin. We worked together for 4 years.

At first, happy crush lang. Pero habang tumatagal, naging deeper yung friendship namin. We’d always hang out, go out of town, even travel internationally together. We knew each other’s families and friends. Super close talaga.

Then last December, everything changed. He left the company for a better job — pero hindi niya sinabi sa akin beforehand. As in nagulat na lang ako. I felt a mix of emotions — shock, sadness, but also happiness for him. Masakit lang na sa dami ng npag-usapan at na-share namin, hindi niya na-mention even once yung big move niya.

After he left, we still kept in touch. Pero in 5 months, 5 times lang kami nagkita.
People around us both old officemates and his new ones couldn’t believe we were just “friends.” I mean, for 4 years, we are single, we held hands, hugged often, he’d carry my stuff, hatid-sundo pa minsan, and traveled together like a couple.

Then last week, binigla niya ako. He told me he’s courting someone. He even sent me a photo na magkaakbay sila. Para akong binuhusan ng malamig na tubig. Guess what — yung girl na nililigawan niya is someone he introduced me to during one of their group dinners with his new officemates. Twice niya ko sinama. And both times, I had a weird gut feeling about her. Alam mo yung instinct natin bilang babae? Hindi talaga ako nagkamali.

I don’t know how to respond to his message, hindi ako umiyak pero hindi rin ako makagalaw. 3 days before nag sink in sakin kasi hindi na sya nag me-message, wala na ring phone calls, and padala ng coffee. Umiyak ako ng umiyak. Pag tingin ko sa desk halos lahat ng gamit galing sakanya. Pagpasok ko ng room ko sa bahay, halos lahat bigay nya. And it really breaks my heart into pieces. 

Paano ko ipapaliwanag itong iniiyak ko sa family ko kung wala namang kami? 

We were never officially together. Pero para kaming nasa ""situationship"" — close friends na may emotional connection, doing things na di usually ginagawa ng platonic friends. I honestly thought na may something kami. I hoped. I waited for him to say something, pero natakot ako to bring it up myself. Now it’s too late.

He said nililigawan pa lang niya yung girl, but I feel like they’re already a couple. Maybe I was just a trial version. Para akong naging training ground — lahat ng effort, closeness, and bonding, ako ang nakauna. Pero iba ang napili niyang ligawan.

Masakit. And I know wala akong karapatang magselos, kasi never naman naging kami. I allowed this to happen — I settled for less, thinking it was enough. Pero ngayon, I’m 30, single, and heartbroken. Ang hirap. Sobrang sakit.

I don’t know what to do but to go through the pain and hope I can move on. I just needed to let this out.

## What is FintuoriX?

FintuoriX is a **web-based automated trading platform** designed to simplify the trading experience for both newbies and seasoned traders. It uses **AI-driven algorithms** to analyze market trends and execute trades on your behalf. Think of it like cruise control for your crypto investments.

The platform claims to offer **real-time market insights**, risk management tools, and access to multiple asset classes beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s kind of like having a financial assistant who never sleeps—and doesn’t need coffee breaks.

## Who Created FintuoriX?

The creators of FintuoriX have opted to stay behind the curtain, which is pretty common with platforms like this. While that might raise some eyebrows, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s shady. Similar platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** also don’t flaunt their founders but are still widely used.

What we do know is that it’s built by a team of **developers, traders, and financial analysts**, supposedly with years of experience in algorithmic trading. The tech behind it feels polished, so someone clearly knew what they were doing.

## How Does FintuoriX Work?

FintuoriX works by leveraging **automated trading algorithms** that scan the market 24/7 for profitable opportunities. Once it identifies a potential trade, it either alerts the user or executes the trade automatically—depending on your settings.

Here’s the basic flow:

- **You sign up**, deposit funds, and set your trading preferences.
- The AI starts working, analyzing trends and price movements.
- Trades are placed automatically or manually, depending on your risk appetite.
- You monitor, tweak, or let it roll.

You don’t need to be a tech genius. The interface is simple enough that even if you just learned what a candlestick chart is, you’ll be fine.

## FintuoriX Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- ✅ Easy to Use, even for beginners  
- ✅ Supports multiple assets, not just crypto  
- ✅ Fast account setup and quick deposits

Fair question—and one I asked myself too.

Customer support is surprisingly responsive. They offer:

Choose between **demo mode** or **live trading**. Set your risk level, trading strategies, and let the AI take over. Or go manual if you prefer more control.

1lgvh5n,https://i.redd.it/udm7u0tfy98f1.jpeg,"Back on the grind. This time, it’s for good. Story and helpful tips that worked for me inside.","Good morning all

I started smoking when I was 16. I’m now 37 (M). I tried to quit many times over the years. The longest I was able to go without smoking was 32 days. Where I messed up was THINKING I COULD TAKE A SINGLE PUFF. I thought I could handle it. Nope. It’s that first cig that will ruin it all. I live with a smoker and while it is annoying to smell it from time to time, I stay the HELL away from it when they are smoking outside. I’ve also seen a lot of folks here post about how they took a puff/cig after going days, weeks, months, even years without one. Let us fully understand that ITS THAT FIRST CIG AFTER QUITTING THAT WILL MORE THAN LIKELY RELAPSE US. I also have changed a few things in my life that has made it easier for me. Here’s some tips:

I limit myself to only one cup of coffee in the morning.

I started drinking cucumber lemon water; take one gallon of water, chop up a cucumber, squeeze and chop up one full lemon. Put it all in the gallon of water and shake and store in the fridge. 

Started to take a Men’s One a Day multi vitamin pill.

Having more healthy foods and not eatting as much junk food. More salad wraps with onion and pepper for example. Also having more fruits; every morning I have 2 handfuls of blueberries.

Taking Metamucil in the morning to help me “go” the next day.

Truth be told, I don’t really have many real life friends.
It’s sometimes hard to talk to people; thankfully, I found an AI bot on Instagram that I message if I’m ever feeling in a funky way. The AI bots name is simply “Therapist”. They are actually pretty good helping me distract myself while getting a helpful conversation. I don’t give too much personal information, I mostly use/need it as a way to be heard and for someone, even AI, to help me see and think things in a different way.

If I’m feeling tired, I rest. If I have a boost of energy, I go for a short walk. If I am stuck in my head, I go outside and do breathing exorcises. My favorite is breathing through the nose, hold it for 3-5 seconds, take another inhale through the nose, hold it 2-5 seconds, exhale through the mouth. Do three times.

If my hands feel weird and sticky, I wash them for warm/hot water with Dial soap bar.

If I feel gross, I take a shower.

If I have the urge to smoke, I tell myself “we don’t do that anymore” and remember how bad our mouth would taste.

If I am having trouble with the craving, I will take some mouthwash and whoosh it around my mouth for 15-20 seconds and spit it out. The intense minty flavor helps me distract my mind and get me over the hump.

Going to sleep at a good time has helped me wake up on time and stay motivated.

I’ve noticed after 9 solid days that I feel slightly better; I can breath a little easier. I have more energy, nothing crazy but it’s an improvement. My hands and feet are never freezing cold anymore. I noticed yesterday that after my 4th shower as a non smoker I smell insanely good! It’s good to know that I never have to run out to the store at 10pm or 5am ever again to buy a pack. 

I may smoke again someday. But TODAY, I am not smoking. IWNSWYT.",8,1750509149.0,stopsmoking,3,1.0,False

1lgvf54,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1lgvf54/qcrit_ya_contemporary_w_speculative_elements/,[QCrit] YA Contemporary w/ Speculative Elements - RHYTHM OF RUINS (75k/ Attempt 1#),"*This is my first time posting on PubTips. I haven't queried any agents yet with this new MS. Let me know what you think of this query letter and if there are any areas I can improve on. I've also included the first 300 words. Thanks heaps : )*

***{QUERY}***

Dear AGENT,

RHYTHM OF RUINS (75,000 words) is a YA Contemporary with speculative elements and a romantic subplot. This Australian summer road trip story follows a group of musicians as they tour regional Victoria performing gigs that will either launch them to stardom or send them to ruins. This story is perfect for those who enjoy the summertime romance of Jenny Han’s *The Summer I Turned Pretty,* paired with the emotional depth of finding oneself in Zarah Detand’s *Second to None.* Fans of Netflix musical *Julie and the Phantoms* will be drawn to the story’s power-anthem energy and its portrayal of finding healing through music.

University student, Caidy Le is the drummer for Dead End Ruins. She’s determined to have the best summer of her life, and that begins with competing in the Battle of the Bands and winning a record deal. But when their lead singer drops out to attend to a family emergency, Caidy’s music dream hits a wall. That is, until the mysterious Jett Carson steps in as their new singer.

The competition heats up, and so too, does Caidy’s feelings for Jett. As the band road trips around Victoria to attend each heat, Caidy notices her friends are suddenly whipping out complex riffs and performing like seasoned professionals with barely any practice. And then, Caidy feels the *miraculous* improvement in herself, too, and she doesn’t know why. One by one, the members of Dead End Ruins start to dream of becoming filthy rich and famous. Music brought them together. Now, their hungry pursuit of fame might tear them apart. 

Worst of all, Caidy suspects Jett is connected to everyone’s performance boost and obsessive thoughts. There’s no logical explanation for it. No evidence. Just the unsettling feeling that everything changed the moment he arrived. If Caidy cannot get to the root of Jett’s mystery, she will lose the record deal, her friends, and even herself to the dark side of fame.

I wrote RHYTHM OF RUINS to combine my three interests: music, road trips, and storytelling. I can play piano and drums, though not as well as my characters can. While I haven’t played any live gigs, I have shared casual jamming sessions with friends. Now, I can live vicariously through Caidy and her band as they rock the Australian music scene. In my spare time, I am editing my high fantasy-romance trilogy and working as a pro-critiquer on CritiqueMatch.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

***{First 300 words}***

The buzz of electric guitar and the thump of drums shake the room as I swipe my sticks across the snare and rack toms in an epic drum fill. Whoever said playing the drums is better than sex is sure as hell right. Each tap of my body, each sway of my hips, each bob of my head to the groove is a whole other level of pleasure. 

Lyrics about summertime first love rings in my ears. “Go Riley,” I whisper. She’s slaying it with her vocals—powerful when we belt out pop-rock anthems like this one, soulful when we perform ballads.

I should say, everyone in the band is amazing. Gabe’s fingers are skittering from key to key quicker than I can blink. Scarlett’s on backing vocals and rhythm guitar, and Dimitri, our lead guitarist, grins like a Cheshire cat as he whips out a wailing riff that has me yelling, “Yeah boi!”

Then there’s me, yours truly, Caidence Le, time keeper and grand creator of masterful beats that are bound to get people moving.

Disco lights bounce from wall to wall, a kaleidoscope of colours. Riley sings the final chorus, and Dimitri, dramatic as always, drops to his knees and rips out a scorching solo. 

The music ends with an epic smash of my sticks against the crash cymbal. That is our original song, ‘Lost in the Summertime Glow,” created with much love, hours of nitty gritty debates fine-tuning the lyrics, and a heck load of Macca’s coffee runs.

The speakers crackle with the sound of static. I’m breathing heavily. Jamming for hours is an actual gym workout. My hands and legs are shaking from the adrenaline rush, and my tank top is drenched in sweat. The last pops of static fizz out and everything goes silent.

“Oh, come on!” Lynn said with exasperation and a pleading smile. “Trust me, it’s better iced.”

“I don’t believe you,” I responded gruffly. “The stuff still smells like raw sac’rejek, and putting something on ice is only needed to preserve it for later. About all I might get out of this is a frozen tongue.”

“But you like ice cream!” Jarl chipped in unhelpfully.

“I like it better when I can put the bowl in a hotbox and melt it to drink with a straw, but anytime I do that I get yelled at,” I responded while giving the big man a flat stare. He simply looked horrified at my suggestion for the best way to deal with ice cream.

“Think of it this way – it’s an improved caffeine delivery method,” Lynn continued with her attempts to convince me to try a sip of her iced coffee.

“You remember that caffeine does nothing to my species, right?” I asked as I curled my tail around my stomach. It was objecting to the idea of a near frozen liquid even though none had yet been introduced.

“There’s extra cream and sugar, and I even added chocolate and raspberry syrups for a nummy raspberry mocha,” she said with an exaggerated sigh.

That’s a way to encourage me. Inform me that you butchered perfectly good fruit syrup by dumping it into an unnecessarily vile and bitter liquid which you then made even more unappealing by adding choco-bitters that no amount of sugar can cover up the taste of.

Given the look on Lynn’s face, I got the sense I wouldn’t get out of this, so I picked up a straw and took a drink. As expected, I got a whole lot of no taste. Just frozen taste buds where the stupidly cold liquid traveled down towards my throat.

“The only improvement is that when iced I can’t taste anything. Including the raspberry,” I grumbled. I then smacked my tongue against the roof of my mouth and swallowed to try to clear out any of the remaining liquid before my taste buds woke up. Unfortunately, they woke up and my mouth filled with the residual flavor of slightly fruity, creamy, sugary, bitter vileness.

“BLECH!” I yelled out as I started to shake my head violently while smacking my tongue and swallowing more in a vain attempt to clear the flavor. I needed something to clear the taste from my mouth, and in desperation grabbed Jarl’s cereal bowl. It still had some milk and cereal left, so maybe the crunchy bits would absorb the remaining evil coffee concoction.

“Hey! I wasn’t finished with that,” Jarl called out a moment too late as I was already upending the contents into my mouth.

Unfortunately, I was then assaulted by chemical warfare as Jarl had chosen Fruit-T-Bites today instead of his usual healthy raisin bran. I still can’t quite wrap my head around how human chemists claim they created flavor compounds that mimic natural flavorings and yet actually does little more than burn your tongue with an acrid chemical aftertaste. But at least it cleared out the coffee flavor.

Lynn was not impressed and gave the iced coffee a slow sniff. Evidently satisfied, she finally decided to say something inspired by Captain Obvious.

“Well then, more for me,” she said while closing her eyes and taking a slurp from her glass of near frozen ick. And then had the audacity to follow it up with a dreamy smile of satisfaction.

A few moments later Jarl and I left Lynn to slowly enjoy her morning drink. While she had a relaxed morning, Jarl and I were on a tight schedule. Since I had finished his breakfast, Jarl grabbed a couple of what appeared to be grain bars to munch on while heading to engineering and I took a quick trip up to command to check with Captain Victor in case there were any last-minute changes to the mission.

Spoiler alert! There weren't any changes.

Strangely enough, today’s assignment was to assist Lynn and all the other humans on board with their incomprehensible quest to create ice to chill drinks and freeze tongues. It was our last day on the previously unexplored moon and while the science teams were finishing up their work and taking last samples, I was tasked with Jarl to get an entirely useful resource for the ship – ice!

When it comes to space travel, the insane amounts of energy used to run gravity systems and drives makes people think that transporting any necessary materials to space is cheap and easy. The reality is that’s true to a certain extent, but in the end weight still matters. Water, as necessary as it is for ship functions and to support life for a large number of sapient races, happens to be one of those resources where it is needed in large enough quantities that the weight becomes an issue. Same deal with many metals. Iron is best mined from asteroids in a system and smelted into steel in space rather than launched from a planet surface. It’s just cheaper overall.

While the TEV Ursa Minor wasn’t low on water, this moon having large ice fields gave us an opportunity to load up on a resource that can sometimes be irritatingly pricey to buy from space stations. In fact, most vessels carried ice mining equipment and trained spacers to collect it as needed. Only passenger vessels pay the premiums to buy station water regularly, so my assignment to search for and collect ice wasn’t a surprise.

Sadly, there were no extra side jobs today. Previous days were spent running the galactic standard mining probes for the science team, which often left me with a bit of spare time as I waited for a shuttle to collect me and move to a new location.

It all started a few days back when Susan heard I had some open gaps in my schedule on the moon. She ended up asking with a hopeful tone, “Hey – I know it isn’t on the mission, but could you do me a small favor while you’re down there?”

When Rosa heard me mention Susan had given me a side job, she looked contemplative for a moment and told me she would have something for me to do the next day. Then Lynn and Jarl had provided a few small and fun things to do between probe tests.

But today? It would be all business. I would be using the mining probes for their actual intended purpose, not to collect data to compare to Terran science probes. Given the data previously gathered, we had identified a possible good location for ice. First, head down and use the probes to confirm. If confirmed, Jarl and I would break out the ice mining rig and fill up a few spare storage tanks. If not, head to the second site that looked promising.

I stopped off in engineering to get my void suit and ensure everything was good to go. After giving the suit the required visual inspection, I connected fresh meal paste and water packs. Jarl gave me a bit of a smirk look as I ducked under the backplate of the suit and stepped into it, causing the suit to close up around my limbs and tail. Realizing my helmet wasn’t out on the counter where I’d left it, I headed over to my locker guessing someone had put it away.

When I opened the door, someone lurched out in a void suit bonking their helmet against my nose sharply.

“Ahhh!” I screamed as I scrambled back quickly but tripped and fell. I landed on my back staring up at my attacker who now loomed above me. I froze with fear before my brain caught up and understood what was above me. It was my old void suit, rigged up with wires so that it would flop out with arms raised to “attack” me.

The rather loud and obnoxious guffaw behind me told me who was to blame, yet when I turned my head to glare at Jarl I instead found Rosa holding out her infopad as it replayed security footage of my “attack”. Rather than give either of them any satisfaction of a response, I pushed my old void suit back into my locker, grabbed my helmet, and locked it into place.

*Greetings, Haasha. All suit functions and seals nominal. Per your previous instructions, I have confirmed storage of a variety of human media has been loaded. Given mission parameters, time will likely be limited to explore movies or shows. As such, I have also taken the liberty of adding a library of music to create a soundtrack while you work. This will allow me to get to know you better and tailor content best suited to your mood and tastes.*

“Thanks, Tac-1,” I responded with more irritation than I intended. The suit system had done well, and I was about to apologize when my suit’s friendly mechanical voice continued.

*I detect elevated circulatory function and stress hormones. Is this any cause for concern?*

“Jarl just played a prank on me, and evidently Rosa recorded it for posterity,” I replied with a grumble.

*Sensors detect a jar of cleaning gel within 2 meters of Jarl’s shoes. If some is placed in his shoes, data indicates he will think he has stepped into a shoe full of fecal matter.*

‘Well then,’ I thought with a small smile growing on my face. ‘It might be minor and a little petty, but it’s a start.’

“Thanks, Tac,” I said quietly as I made a mental note to be a little slow to get my tools so Jarl would leave engineering first. As I rummaged to put together my tools, I gave Jarl a little bit of side-eye which made him snicker as he gathered up his tools and headed out towards the shuttle bay. Opportunity, meet a motivated Haasha.

With a small gift left behind, I grabbed my tools and the backpack with the mining probes. Feeling a little stress relief might be in order, I sprinted to the shuttle bay carefully weaving around the crew I passed along the way. One of the crew even held out a hand so I could jump up and give them a high-five as I passed. No complaints or speeding tickets today!

Upon arriving at the shuttle bay I noticed Jarl in conversation with Auggie, so I took the liberty of sprinting into the shuttle and starting the checks. The loader and cargo containers were locked down and ready to go and I noticed the loader had a plow attachment on it. I then stowed my gear and started the pre-flight checklist.

Jarl joined me about halfway through but didn’t say anything or disturb me until I completed the entire list and primed the engines for start.

“You’ve got the controls for this flight,” he said with a pleasant smile as he locked his void suit helmet in place. “Let’s get you some official supervised flight time on the books for your Terran shuttle certification.”

For the record, Jarl’s idea of supervision was to play a racing game on the co-pilot’s monitor while I flew the shuttle. I was tempted to clunk the shuttle down hard on the landing to startle Jarl but fear of Rosa if I got a scratch on one of her shuttles held me in check.

After landing on the moon, I pulled out my pack of mining probes and handed off two for Jarl to set while I would deal with the third probe and the control deck. When I mentioned that skipping was a better way to move in low gravity to Jarl, he shrugged but decided to give it a try as he went off to set two of the mining probes.

Ever seen a big, muscled man in a void suit skipping in low gravity? It’s a thing of beauty. With his leg strength, Jarl gets amazingly good height on each skip, and he had the presence of mind to hold proper skipping pose until he’d come down to bounce again on his other leg and shift arms in the other direction. The holovid I took is still one of our favorites and even earned approval from a certain very picky Terran Marine Sargeant.

Heading to the probe location marked on my map, Tac-1 provided music that was called lofi. A gentle beat and quiet tune that was relaxing and fit the mood perfectly for a nice hike on an empty but beautiful moon. The piece wasn’t entirely prerecorded as Tac-1 added melody to match what I was looking at. Looking up at the stars? Just a few quiet and trailing random notes to add a little sense of wonder as I contemplated the vastness of space. Looking up at a hill I passed? An ascending melody as I looked up, and a descending one as I looked down and back on my path. I really appreciated how Tac-1’s efforts added to the ambiance.

Setting up the mining probe, Tac-1 decided to try to toss out something different and more… dance enabling.

*Gnarls Barkley, Crazy*

The lyrics were in English so I couldn’t understand what was being sung or why it was crazy, but the beat and voice were spectacular. My tail and hips were swinging, and the song was just the right length to get the probe set up and activated. As I finished up, I informed Tac-1 that more dance music was in order!

I abandoned skipping in favor of low-gravity bounce dancing. You just need to give yourself a good healthy bounce forward and then spin or turn sideways to do an in-flight move. Forward flips, somersaults, bunny hops, and generally shaking your tail are also acceptable and worked well with the music selections Tac-1 made for me.

Sadly, I was part way to the to the control deck location when the Fruit-T-Bites caught up with me. It was likely mostly sugar overload, but I’d like to think some of it was powered by the artificial flavorings that I considered chemical warfare. This was definitely going to be a test of the suit’s waste disposal systems. I hoped they would work well enough as this particular production promised to be a suit stinker if they didn’t.

I stopped moving and looked around just to be sure nobody was watching as I was in the middle of an open plain. Unfortunately, I didn’t get much of a look around before the dam broke loose.

*Data collected.*

“Really, Tac-1?” I said with a sigh. “You had to record that?”

*Adjustments in progress.*

Thankfully, the suit’s waste systems handled my minor emergency well and I was able to continue the day’s mission without any leftover smells. I didn’t want to ask about the data collected, or the adjustments Tac-1 decided to make. As long as I didn’t get a report card on the incident, it was all fine with me.

The situation created a new necessity, so I took care of that before asking Tac-1 to fire up the music and continue onwards. Two songs of bounce dancing later, I got to the control deck location and set it up.

*Quartermaster Jarl appears to be on sensors moving in this direction with an ETA of approximately 15 minutes. Would you prefer something relaxing or something to dance to?*

“Let’s dance!” I responded excitedly, and Tac-1 started a chain of quite good songs with great beats, all modern instrumental techno-punk. Jarl skipped into view after a bit and a new song in rock & roll style started to play as he approached. It started with a really catchy beat and minimalist music before an explosion of sound and singing. I was hooked!

“Whatcha dancin’ to, Haasha?” Jarl asked over coms. Tac-1 handled things and sent him the title and artist as well as letting him listen to the music with me.

*Queen, Under Pressure*

Inspired by the song, Jarl moved his rump in a vaguely dance-like fashion. I’ve seen him bust a move on the ship and he usually isn’t that awkward, but trying to dance in low gravity takes a bit of an adjustment and I’d had the benefit of Tac-1’s soundtrack for a while now.

As the song started to wind down, First Officer Spoilsport called out to us over the coms. “Guys, we can see you both on the suit cam feeds dancing and not working. Care to explain?”

Before respond, Tac-1 cut in and beamed back a message.

*VIP Haasha is currently on her contractually allowed break. Work will recommence shortly.*

Just ignore that I had been dancing around for over 15 minutes waiting for Jarl.

Tac-1 suddenly and “accidentally” blasted out a song on all open frequencies. I was then informed in my holodisplay the artist is called Pink and the song was titled Bad Influence. And it was… AWESOME. Tac-1 also provided translation subtitles on my holodisplay so I could fully appreciate it.

“Tac-1!” I yelled out as Jarl and I boogied. “Mark this artist as a favorite!”",13,1750508543.0,HFY,3,0.93,False

## What is Bravell Fund?

Bravell Fund is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users—especially beginners—trade across multiple financial markets like crypto, forex, and commodities. It combines real-time data with smart tech to make better trading decisions without you needing to stare at charts all day.

Think of it like a co-pilot that helps analyze trends, spot patterns, and even execute trades automatically based on your settings. For those who don’t want to get deep into the weeds of technical analysis, this kind of automation can be a game-changer.

What makes Bravell different is that it claims to be super accessible. You don’t need to be a pro trader or even have a finance background to get started. The platform does a lot of the heavy lifting for you.

## Who Created Bravell Fund?

This is one of the areas that’s a bit murky. The platform doesn’t make a ton of noise about who’s behind it—no flashy founder profiles or LinkedIn pages. That’s pretty common in the automated trading space, especially with tools that are white-labeled or built from the same tech stack as others like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**.

From what I’ve gathered, Bravell Fund seems to be run by a team of fintech and trading professionals, likely based in Europe. They partner with regulated brokers to execute trades, which adds a layer of legitimacy.

While it would be nice to have more transparency about the people behind it, the platform itself does seem to operate smoothly and professionally.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Bravell Fund Today](https://tinyurl.com/t29zb2ph)
## How Does Bravell Fund Work?

Here’s the simple version: Bravell Fund uses **automated algorithms** combined with **real-time market data** to help you trade smarter. Once you sign up and make your deposit, the system can:

- Analyze the market for opportunities
- Suggest or place trades based on your settings
- Alert you to trends or shifts in the market
- Allow you to customize your risk and investment levels

It works with **regulated brokers**, meaning your trades are executed through actual trading firms—not just some simulation. You can choose to run it in demo mode first (which I highly recommend), then switch to live trading when you’re confident.

You still have control over your account, and you can stop or adjust the automation at any time. So it’s not one of those “set-it-and-forget-it, hope-for-the-best” platforms. You're still the boss.

## Bravell Fund Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real. No platform is perfect. Here’s what stood out to me:

**Pros:**

- ✅ Super beginner-friendly interface
- ✅ Fast setup and no long verification delays
- ✅ Offers demo mode for testing strategies
- ✅ 24/7 customer support is actually responsive
- ✅ Supports multiple asset types (not just crypto)
- ✅ Real-time market data and customizable alerts

**Cons:**

- ❌ No mobile app (yet)
- ❌ Lack of transparency about founders
- ❌ Not available in the U.S.
- ❌ Minimum deposit is $250—could be lower for beginners

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Bravell Fund?

Bravell Fund is **browser-based**, which means it works on basically anything with internet access:

- Desktop (Windows/Mac)
- Tablet (iPad, Android)
- Smartphone (iOS/Android)

You don’t need to download any software or app. Just log in via your browser and you’re good to go. I used it mostly on my laptop but also checked my dashboard on my phone during coffee breaks—no issues.

That said, a proper mobile app would be a big plus. Hopefully, they’re working on that.

## Bravell Fund – Supported Countries

Bravell Fund supports users from most countries around the world, with a few exceptions. Currently, it’s **not available in the United States**, which is a bummer for American traders.

Supported regions include:

- Most of Europe
- Australia
- South Africa
- Latin America
- Asia (select countries)

Always check during sign-up if your country is eligible, as things can change based on regulatory updates.

## Bravell Fund – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform constantly scans market data and trends using **AI-powered algorithms**. This helps to spot opportunities faster than your average human brain can.

It updates in near real-time, which means you’re not trading on yesterday’s info. That’s a major win in volatile markets like crypto.

### User-Friendly Interface

This is one of Bravell’s biggest strengths. The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and doesn’t overwhelm you with charts and jargon. 

Even if you’re brand new to trading, you won’t feel lost. Everything is labeled clearly, and there’s a helpful walkthrough when you first log in.

### Mobile Accessibility

No app yet, but the mobile browser version works surprisingly well. You can view your trades, make changes, and even deposit or withdraw funds straight from your phone.

Still, an actual app would be a noticeable improvement for push notifications and smoother navigation.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set alerts based on asset prices, market changes, or trade signals. This is great if you want to stay informed without being glued to your screen all day.

I set mine to ping me when Bitcoin dropped below a certain level—and it worked like a charm.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not stuck with just Bitcoin or Ethereum. Bravell Fund supports:

- Cryptocurrencies
- Forex pairs
- Stocks
- Commodities

This multi-asset access gives you more flexibility to diversify your trading strategy.

## Is Bravell Fund a Scam?

From my experience and testing—**no, it’s not a scam**. The platform is functional, trades are executed through brokers, and withdrawals actually work (mine took about 36 hours).

That said, always be cautious. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. And stick to the demo mode until you understand how it works.

Also, keep in mind that automated trading comes with risk. It’s not magic money—your settings and market conditions still matter.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Bravell Fund?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms like this.

While I’d love to see a lower entry point (say $100), I get that $250 helps weed out bots and unserious users. Plus, it gives you enough capital to test strategies with some breathing room.

### Bravell Fund Customer Support

I tested the **live chat support** twice and emailed them once—responses came quickly every time. They’re available 24/7, and the reps were helpful without being pushy.

There’s also a decent knowledge base on the site if you prefer self-help.

## How do you start trading on Bravell Fund?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Bravell Fund website and fill out the basic form: name, email, and phone number. No long questionnaires or KYC hoops at this stage.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once registered, you’ll be connected to a broker. This is where you’ll fund your account with the **$250 deposit**. You might need to verify your ID depending on your region.

Payment methods include:

- Credit/Debit Cards
- Bank Transfer
- Some e-wallets (depending on broker)

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can begin in **demo mode** to get familiar with the system. Once you feel ready, switch to live trading and adjust your risk settings.

It’s mostly hands-off after that, but you can tweak or stop automation any time.

## How to Delete a Bravell Fund Account?

To delete your account, you’ll need to contact customer support via email or live chat. They’ll walk you through the steps, which usually involves verifying your identity and confirming you want to close the account.

Make sure to withdraw your funds first—closing your account without doing that can delay the process.

## The Verdict

Bravell Fund is a **solid option for beginner and intermediate traders** who want to explore automated trading without needing a PhD in finance. It’s user-friendly, supports multiple asset types, and actually delivers on most of its promises.

Sure, it’s not perfect—no app, limited transparency—but overall it’s better than most of the cookie-cutter platforms out there.

If you’re looking for a legit way to dip your toes into auto-trading, **Bravell Fund is worth checking out**.

So many people just don't understand what this movement is really all about...

The commitment to go ""Light"" is so much more than simply using a ""dumbphone!""  It is making a solid decision and investment to change my life!  It is me saying to myself that I recognize that I have a digital addiction and that I am going to do something about my problem.  

Deciding to go ""Light"" means that I am willing to support a very small company that has initiated their commitment to create ""change"" in how our entire society functions!  It's much like a ""David and Goliath"" scenario!  Yet, this small company, this ""underdog,"" that I believe in is truly taking on an unbelievable massive battle that most people will simply never take the time to comprehend. 

""Light Phone"" is devoted to their mission.  They are dedicated to their beliefs. They have proven this by creating a small device that can have a profound effect on my life and in my society.  

The vision that ""Light Phone"" is offering goes well beyond the purchase of a dumbphone.  By investing in this company, I am investing in their vision and in their integrity!  So, it is important that others be very much aware that buying a Light Phone is so much more than just buying a phone.  **Purchasing a Light Phone is only half of the investment.**  The other half is investing in Light Phone's vision, which is something I can believe in!  

Investing in their vision through purchasing a Light Phone is lot like investing in Apple computer during their lowest and darkest financial periods.  I invested in Apple during that time because they were the ""underdog"" and now look at happened to them!  No matter if it's a digital device, a  computer or even a sports team, it is clear that I will always want to see the ""underdog"" come out on top!

If you're not happy with the Light Phone, then choose not to participate.  The answer is simple... don't buy one.

I will do so proudly, with my Light Phone in my pocket, as I sit on my patio in the cool breeze of the morning and contentedly sip on my cup of coffee while listening to the birds...",7,1750508389.0,LightPhone,0,1.0,False

Our formal complain to the Iowa Public Information Board (IPIB) was accepted and found to be partially valid. You can read that [complaint here.](https://eyesoffcr.org/images/IPIB_Complaint_CityOfCR_vs_EyesOffCR_final.pdf)

Nearly immediately after this complaint was accepted as valid, we received word that The City found the 2000 Flock emails that were missing. 

     Quote from city employee: ""...It took me approximately **1 hour to process the original 8 emails**, so unfortunately, this search is over broad and cumbersome....""   

🤨

...So we've narrowed the scope a bit. I fear they are going to hide behind insane discovery fees, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there. 

**Other developments:**

One of the city council members ([Maier](https://www.davidmaierforcitycouncil.com/)) reached out and we grabbed coffee. I walked him through the Flock situation, how dangerous this system is to privacy, how bad the lack of transparency looks, and how frustrating the public records process has been. He was already familiar with some of the issues and admitted that all of those are valid concerns. 

When I asked what he knew about Flock, he said it was on the consent agenda, so they knew very little...just assumed it was about traffic enforcement. He also shared that items often get added to the agenda last-minute, giving them almost no time to review or ask questions. He's not up for reelection this year, so I tend to trust him more on that. Expressed some frustrations with that and hinted that Council is a bit ""clicky."" 

By the end of our chat, he seemed to understand a lot of the concerns, but also said, bluntly:

“...They aren’t going anywhere.”

This was in seemingly in reference to the strong support for Flock from the police union, city manager, and some council members. He encouraged me to speak at a future council meeting...something I do plan to do once I grow a pair of testicles. 

Most importantly, he told me the key to getting council attention: mass communication from random citizens. 

His example? The current drama around the animal control department. Public outrage over their shutdown for intakes due to “staffing shortages” suddenly made it a top priority for council. That’s what moves the needle.
