A little bit about me...

I moved to the city for work this summer, previously London (work) and North Carolina (school). I work at a design firm in SoHo, in-person 4-5 days a week, and try to keep busy most nights as work allows. 

I’m a social person and like to get out in my free time — live music, night classes, and some volunteering here and there. I ran track in college and keep active most days w/ running or intramural soccer/basketball.

Around the house I always keep things clean and organized, especially shared spaces. I’ve had amazing experiences with past roommates and it would be great to live with others who are looking for a friendly and social apartment.

If you’re also moving around the same time, message me and we can FaceTime or meet for coffee/drinks to coordinate!",1,1765835854.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False

1pnk9xc,https://v.redd.it/ypmwiqkewf7g1,A.I. Creator Collective – 30-Day Reality Check (and what’s next),"# 

**COMMUNITY**

**Yes, it’s still free.** Four months in, nobody has asked for or been given a penny — and that is not changing.

About two months ago, I posted an update here that unexpectedly did \~18k views in a 12k sub. (AITubers)  
Last month’s update landed closer to \~3.8k.

Honestly? That’s the story.

Not a one-week spike — steady, compounding growth.

What better time than **Motivational Monday** for a check-in?

This is a quick **state of the ship**: what’s working, what we fixed, and where we’re steering next.

# TL;DR (for the busy builders)

• We just crossed **90 members** and are approaching 100  
• We’ve **roughly tripled in size** since announcing our existence  
• The **school is running daily** (Lesson of the Day is real and ongoing)  
• Discord is still the heartbeat, **but the website + YouTube channel are live**  
• **One door now** — we merged servers to reduce friction  
• Still free. Still creator-run. Still troll-proof

If you DM, copy/paste the join template at the bottom. It genuinely helps.

**Only official DMs come from:**  
FreedomChipmunk47  
Current-Damage2165  
jehallan\_jewel  
Doomscroll-FM  
McFly-throwaway

Anyone else claiming to rep us… doesn’t. Tell them to go build their own pirate ship.

# What happened this month (no hype)

# 1. The School is alive

Daily *Lesson of the Day*. Short, practical, zero fluff.  
Prompts, retention ideas, monetization basics, policy updates, tool warnings.

Beginner-friendly without being condescending.

# 2. The Collective is doing what it was supposed to do

**Real WIPs. Real analytics. Real failures. Real successes.**

People helping each other fix thumbnails, hooks, pacing, and strategy — without ego.

**Some real wins from inside the Collective:**  
• One creator just broke **1 million streams per month on Spotify**  
• Two more members reached **monetization**  
• Multiple members were interviewed for **Cornell University research on AI content moderation**, sharing real-world issues with policy inconsistency and enforcement. If that work helps improve things even a little, it benefits all of us.

No “AI doesn’t count” debates.  
No grindset nonsense.  
No drive-by trolls.

# 3. We stopped trying to do everything ourselves

We added trusted folks to help with:  
• **Recruiting & onboarding**  
• Curriculum & LOTD  
• Tool testing & demos  
• Community health & moderation  
• Analytics & monetization sanity checks

This was necessary. Scale is real.  
We brought on great people — and they brought on great people — and now we’re growing in every direction.

# 4. Website + YouTube are real now

The site is live (early, imperfect, honest).  
The AICC YouTube channel is active and being built **for the community**, not guru nonsense.

Yes, monetization is part of the plan.  
No, it won’t be gross.

# 🔑 One Door Now (Why we merged)

Two servers made sense at 20 people.  
At 90+, it was just friction.

So we merged.

One shared space with clearly labeled lanes:  
• Beginner-friendly without slowing advanced builders  
• Advanced rooms without gatekeeping  
• Shared culture from day one

We didn’t kill the school.  
We didn’t dilute the Collective.  
We removed overhead and sped everything up.

Same mission. Less chaos. Better flow.

# What we’re building (still true)

A creator-run lab + school where:  
• You learn faster  
• You’re not treated like a lead  
• You can ask “does this suck?” and get a real answer  
• Nobody punches down

We *are* still working on the paid beginner course. We said December… after saying November… 😅  
It’ll ship when it’s actually good enough to be worth selling.

We’re treating this like a **music scene**, not a mastermind:  
We show up.  
We watch each other’s work.  
We give notes that matter.  
We don’t fake engagement.

# A note on money (full transparency)

We’ve been running this for **about four months** and **haven’t taken a dime from anyone**.

That said, tools, infrastructure, and time do add up. Because of that, we’re developing an **optional Patreon**.

Important part:  
• Nothing that’s free now will move behind a paywall  
• No lessons, access, or community features will be removed  
• Patreon will offer **additional perks** for people who want to help keep the ship afloat

No pressure. No guilt. Just an option.

# How to join (DM copy/paste)

**Subject:** Joining A.I. Creator Collective

• Your experience level (be real)  
• What you’re making (links/examples)  
• What you want to learn in the next 30 days  
• What you can contribute (feedback, prompts, editing, music, analytics, etc.)  
• Time zone + best Pacific hours to reach you

**Only DM the names listed above.**

# What this is NOT

• Not a hustle cult  
• Not a guru funnel  
• Not “trust me bro”  
• Not a place where people punch down

If you enjoy flinging poo from the bleachers, Reddit already has premium seating.

If you commented “interested” last time and didn’t hear back — **DM again**.  
Threads move fast. DMs are trackable. I’m human and occasionally need coffee.

We’re not chasing a trend.  
We’re building infrastructure for creators who plan to still be here next year.

Still stubbornly troll-proof.  
Still annoying the right people.",1,1765835834.0,aiecosystem,0,1.0,False

My friend S (18F) and I (19F) have been friends since freshman year of high school! She was one of the first friends I had made in high school and the first friend I came out to (I’m Bi). Which was a really big thing as we lived in such a conservative state! It turned out she was asexual so we ended up bonding instantly. We used to be part of a bigger group, but we split into after a big argument between the two “leaders” I guess. I tried to stay out of the drama as much as I could but ended up taking my friend S’s side as I was not very close with M (19F). She always jokes that she won Me in the divorce, but I’ve been getting the feeling of just not being wanted in the group… So what really started this whole realization was the day of my grad party! It was the day after the schools senior party that’s supposed to promote a non-alcohol party for teenagers! Now my mom was head of the event board for parties at my school so I would often stay later at events to either help clean up or show up early to help set up! Now this party lasted till around 2:00 am so everybody was pretty tired! But I ended up staying till 4:00 am with my mom to help clean things up! My best friend P (19F) (who wasn’t a part of S’s group) was staying behind to also help out as she was also going home with us. My party started at 4:00 pm on Sunday. That way me and my mom would have time to get some sleep before we started finishing prep for the party! I had invited quite a few of my friends most were from S’s group, and a few were individual friends that I had made in my years at high school! Everything went really smoothly with the preparations and I was really excited to see everybody arrive! A ton of friends and family showed up, including my best friend P who was running on 5 coffees it had been to multiple grad parties already! Girl was totally beat! I then received a text at 4:30 from S saying she was too tired to come from the school party last night. Now mind you her and the rest of the crew left at 12:00-1:00 am as they didn’t want to stay for the rest of the party! So I was a bit confused when she said she was too tired to come, but just brushed it off! The whole rest of S’s group ended up, not coming either, they all had said that they were too tired or that they had already went to too many grad parties that day! Now I was a bit peeved as I had gone to most of their grad parties, including S’s even though I had work that day. I ended up taking most of the day off to go to her party! I ended up finding out the next day that her and a few people from the group ended up hanging out at her house later that day. I felt absolutely crushed as me and my mom had spent time and effort on dessert and decorations, and had spent money on getting a sizable portion of catering food. After the incident, we didn’t hang out too much during the summer and I ended up going to college! We have been in touch over my time in college. Recently, I came back for a week for Thanksgiving break and had a sleepover with her at my house! She got me up to speed on the “drama” within the group. And how she was recently thinking of cutting off B (19 nonbinary). Now, I was quite surprised as B and S are quite close, even though they’ve only known each other for 2 years. For added context nobody in the group really got along with B as they would constantly  make comments about others and make passive aggressive comments in conversation. S would often make excuses saying that’s just how they are. Up until recently when she told me she just could not take it anymore! I told her it might’ve been the best to cut things off with them as B’s not the nicest person. And I blankly told her that I didn’t really think B liked me or anybody else in the group (they only liked S). That’s when S told me that they had been talking trash about me behind my back constantly. Now this kind of struck accord with Me because if one of my friends was talking bad about another friend of mine I would tell that friend right away and cut off the other friend or try to resolve the issue.  So I was kind of pissed to learn that they had been talking trash about me to the whole group for a GOOD YEAR and a HALF! S said it was because I “talked smart” which I don’t even know what that means! But why is that a good incentive to talk bad about somebody?!?! She just brushed it off and said B talked bad about everybody! I kind of exploded a bit on her and we ended up going to bed on a bitter note. I apologize to her in the morning and she said that she understood and was going to cut B off. (But since then she hasn’t). Now I kind of got the inkling ever since prom that B was possibly talking behind my back. I wouldn’t say we’re close, but I have always been nice to them! Anyway, during prom, they whispered into S’s ear while looking at me when we were standing in line to take a photo together. S laughed and they ended up standing in line giggling together the whole time. I didn’t really think much of it at the time, but felt a little insecure! I’m a pretty shy person when it comes to social environment, so I tend to get a bit quiet. So I didn’t really say anything about it until the day after. I asked S about it and she said that they were talking about S’s ex! At the time, I just accepted that and went on with my life, but now looking back at it, I just feel sad and confused. After that sleepover, I haven’t really talked to her too much and ended up throwing myself into my exams, using them as an excuse, not to talk. Although I honestly feel like I can’t keep being friends with her, knowing what I know now. I’ve recently just got home from my first semester and I’m starting my winter break. I know I’ll need to confront her or just continue ghosting her. I don’t know what to do and I don’t know if I can continue our friendship! Am I overreacting and pushing blame onto her for B’s actions, or do you think she really knew?! I don’t know if I’m being paranoid over nothing. But I have severe trust issues already….",1,1765835735.0,AITAH,0,0.99,False

We got a cold cut and pork skewer banh mi (both spicy but was mild to medium heat), with caramel and coconut coffee. The coconut coffee was less sweet.

The banh mi is quite heavy (in weight) and i asked for extra butter… both slapped. If you prefer stronger flavours get the pork skewer banh mi. Butter with banh mi is a very good combination.

Ordered another cold cut banh mi for lunch tomorrow, because i think it’s good value.

He is getting hip surgery in January, so I know he will need something to entertain himself, but I don't know what to get! He is in his mid-60s and retired.

I have previously lent him a copy of Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life by William Finnegan. Last year, I gave him a couple of Sherlock Holmes stories (he requested this). He requested a book about mushrooms (for foraging) from my sister. He has lent me Waterman: The Life and Times of Duke Kahanamoku by David Davis. He has bought me a giant coffee table book about San Onofre (surfing beach) and a book about great hikes in California. I am not sure if he prefers fiction or non-fiction, but I thought **a story of some sort** (as opposed to a coffee table book or reference book) could be good for him while he's recovering.

My husband and I surf, and my dad is pretty enthused by this. He grew up in the SF Bay Area and would head out to surf or boogie board often before he had kids (me and my sister) and moved to a more affordable town inland. On his own, he loves mountain biking (just got an e- mountain bike) and road cycling and used to race. Within the past few years, he picked up standup paddle-boarding on reservoirs in town. He is pretty in tune with the outdoors and can easily identify birds, plants, and insects. He loves dogs but doesn't have one currently (used to have retrievers but oddly his last pet was a mini dachshund). Right before retiring, he joined a motorcycle club (they mostly ride Harleys). He loves sports - I'd say baseball is his favorite (Giants fan). My whole life, he has been a health nut who does different diets - usually whatever is popular at the time like gluten-free, etc. Currently he is obsessed with protein and hitting the gym.

He was kind of a party guy when he was younger, but he had good work ethic as he got older. He was good at his job and was promoted quickly and took classes as needed, but he never particularly liked working. I would also say he generally dislikes politics.

We ended up talking for like an hour about music and she showed me some artists I'd never heard before which was honestly amazing.

We exchanged instagrams and have been texting pretty much everyday since then. Like good morning texts, sending each other songs, talking about our days type of thing. She even mentioned she wants to visit Japan someday and I literally have money aside that I want to spend on a japan trip too so that was cool to hear. The vibe feels really natural and different from app convos you know?

Here's the thing tho, she mentioned she just got out of a relationship like 3 months ago. Nothing crazy dramatic but she said it was her first serious one. Part of me wants to ask her to grab coffee or check out another record store together but im also worried its too soon for her and I dont wanna mess up whatever this is by being pushy.

Should I just keep the texting going for a bit longer or is it weird to not suggest meeting up again when we're talking this much? I genuinely like her company and don't want to come off desperate but also feel like we have something worth exploring",17,1765835307.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **FC Thun vs. FC Winterthur: A Safety Seminar in Disguise**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a match that’s less “thrilling climax” and more “safety seminar on defensive coordination.” FC Thun (the league leaders) host FC Winterthur (the defensive equivalent of a sieve) in a clash that’s as predictable as a toaster catching fire if you stick a banana in it. Let’s break it down with the precision of a Swiss watch and the humor of a fan who just realized their team’s goalkeeper is a former circus acrobat… who forgot his net.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You’ll Actually Enjoy

The odds favor Thun at **1.7 to 1.8** (implied probability: \~55-58%), while Winterthur’s chances hover around **3.8 to 4.3** (20-25%). The draw? A coin flip in a hurricane (23-26%). These numbers scream “bet on Thun,” but let’s not ignore the context:

* **Winterthur’s defense** is a work of art—if your art class only made “how to concede goals.” They’ve leaked in **13 straight matches**, averaging **2.71 goals per game**. Their offense? A drowsy espresso: **1.29 goals per game**.
* **Thun**, meanwhile, is the league’s best team but carries the weight of a **leaky roof**. They’ve conceded in four straight games, and their recent 0-2 drubbing by St. Gallen proves even leaders can have off nights. Still, their attack (1.82 goals/game) is led by Christopher Ibayi, a goalscorer so prolific he’s basically a Swiss version of a coffee machine—reliable, efficient, and likely to burn you if you get too close.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Ineptitude, and a Christmas Carol

Winterthur’s woes are as deep as a Swiss alpine lake:

* Their **left-back is suspended**, and two other defenders (Enock Owusu and Tiemoko Outtara) are injured. Are they playing soccer or a game of “human Jenga”?
* Their coach, Ludovic Magnin, is under pressure after a 0-0 draw to Lausanne that had fans muttering, “At least a draw means we didn’t embarrass ourselves… \*too m

Hey !

I’m flying in tomorrow (Dec 16) on a one-way ticket and will be staying around Norwood East. This trip is about getting out of my hometown, stepping outside my comfort zone, and seeing what Manitoba has to offer.

A bit about me: I’m 29 and come from a pretty hands-on background. I’ve spent 10 years in hospitality, 10 years in the music business (songwriting, music production, and sound engineering), 2 years in AV, and about 3 years as a car technician. I also graduated from a trade school where I learned home construction and renovations. I’m comfortable bouncing between creative and technical worlds, and I’m hoping to find work while I’m out here.

Creatively, music is a big focus for me. I’m looking to connect with local musicians, producers, creatives, and anyone involved in live shows. I’d love to collaborate, make music, and possibly do some live performances if opportunities come up.

Outside of that, I’m pretty easygoing. I’m into video games, sports (I’ll watch just about anything), hitting the gym, checking out the city, going to local pubs, clubs on the weekend, and live events of any kind. I’m very open to meeting anyone and everyone locals, creatives, entrepreneurs, gamers, musicians, or just people who enjoy good conversation.

I’m down for:

Coffee hangs

Studio sessions

Nightlife

Live events 

Outdoor activities / sightseeing


For context, I’m traveling light one suitcase with clothes and a backpack, keeping things simple and flexible.

If anyone’s down to connect, hang out, collaborate, or even just point me toward cool spots or opportunities in Winnipeg, I’d love to hear from you. I’m new to Manitoba and open to new experiences, so straightforward, honest communication is all I ask.

Unfortunately it was right before summer break (Uni) and we kind of never were in the same place at the same time in the following 3 months but stayed in contact texting, but not daily.

Then she left for a two months internship abroad, during which we texted almost daily and facetimed two times. She even sent me a cute postcard from there.

Last week we finally got together for a coffee where we talked about her time abroad and whatnot and played some cards and generally had a good time I’d say.

I think this already means something since we initially met briefly 5 months ago and managed to stay in contact for that long.

So far so good, but I still have this voice in my head trying to tell me she seems not as interested as I feel I am. Because mostly we talk about what she does and did and so on but she rarely seems to show interest in what’s going on in my life and asks me follow ups about what I told her I am gonna do on the weekend for example.

At this stage I would feel weird to communicate that to her because it feels like something you would say to your partner in a relationship but not to someone you just had a first real date with.

I went on very few dates in the past and don’t think that I am a very avid flirter, so I think I struggle to subtly communicate my intentions to her, let alone openly address.

Do you think that’s what I should do though?

Should I just take it slow, go on some more dates and see how it goes and not overthink it so much?

Has anyone been in a similar situation?

I saw a cookie recipe that uses plum jelly or jam as a filling and I'm wondering if there's a way to turn my simple syrup into a jelly.  I've never made jelly or jam before so I'm not quite sure where to start.  

The syrup is from a local market and there isn't any nutrition label so I don't know the exact sugar content, although I expect it's 1 to 1 with water.  Would pectin be required or would lemon suffice?  Should additional sugar be added?  It needs to be spreadable so it doesn't need to firm up quite as much as a standard jelly.  Maybe more of a jam consistency.

I have MAYBE two cups of syrup so I don't expect to have to do any real canning since I plan to use it all specifically for this cookie.",1,1765835037.0,Canning,3,1.0,False

So come along with me as we wonder through opals lodge✨

This is a snow-dusted A-Frame lodge where lanterns glow against the cold, bonfires crackle at the heart of it all, and every path invites you to slow down and wander. Not to mention a view that’ll blow your mind! 

Follow the stepping stones through the snow, gather around the fire with friends, hit the local shop or hang out on the back patio sipping the flavor of the week. You can also go for a coffee at the bakery, see Santa’s sleigh, or hop on the ski lift for a peaceful ride above the pines—just long enough to take in the winter views before winding down at the spa. Warm lights, soft steam, and quiet corners make it the perfect place to rest after a day in the snow.

Built with cozy gatherings, shared moments, and a little storybook magic in mind, opals lodge is less about rushing through and more about staying awhile. ❄️🔥

Usually I'm chugging my coffee while checking emails, planning my day, thinking about the meetings I have later, basically doing everything except actually drinking the coffee. My mind is already three hours ahead before I even finish the cup.

But something made me just stop. I held the mug with both hands, felt the warmth, actually smelled it before drinking, and then just focused on the taste. And honest to god it was almost overwhelming? Like I could taste all these different notes I never noticed before. Made me realize how much of my life I'm just going through the motions without actually experiencing any of it.

Its kind of scary when you think about it. Like what else am I missing while my brain is constantly somewhere else? I've been so focused on being productive and getting through my to do list that I forgot to actually be present for any of it. Even the small stuff like coffee or walking to my car or eating lunch.

*Getting too old for this.*

In front of my ragged couch, the TV continued with its black and white parade of old footage from a World War One documentary, though the war seemed nearly over now. Judging by the digital clock on the mantelpiece, which read 3:49 AM, I’d been asleep for at least five hours. My body ached, a familiar problem at my age, but enough that I chided myself for not going to bed earlier like a responsible person. It had been a long day, so I came home to a cold shower, a few hot dogs warmed in the microwave and settled down to watch some television before bed. Of course, at 55 years old I’d misjudged how tired I really was and spent close to half the night slumped on my sofa, which meant I would be paying for it in the morning with stiff joints and a sore back.

Palming my cracked Motorola from the coffee table, I found the TV remote and hit the *mute* button as I answered the call. “Hello?”

Shaky breathing grated on the other end, and after a few moments, a girl’s hushed voice whispered through. “Mr. Todd?”

Ice rippled through my veins at the sound of Cindy’s panicked voice, and I sat up straighter to rub at my bleary eyes. “Yeah, I’m here. You okay? What’s wrong?”

Silence greeted me, a strange mix of static, trembling breaths, and what sounded like sniffles as she tried to hold back tears. “Please . . . help me.”

“Cindy?” Concern building in my mind, I switched on a nearby lamp and pulled myself from the couch with a grunt at the tightness in my lower back. “You there? What’s going on?”

More shaky gasps followed, and just over the static, I thought I heard the faint sound of melodic humming in the background.

“Something’s wrong.” Cindy whispered, her words so quiet that they made each breath sound like cannon fire. “T-The woods are . . . something fell out of the sky and . . . it was so loud, it woke me up. There’s a fire.”

Brow furrowed, I moved fast for the kitchen, stumbling through the dark interior of my little cabin to grope for the light switch. “Stay calm, just stay calm and talk to me. You said there’s a fire? How far away? Can you get to your car?”

Another sniffle came through, clogged with harsh interference as the signal weakened, a sound that made my veins throb with tension. “I-I can’t. Something’s here, it’s in the house, it’s *in the house with me*. W-We can’t get out.”

My throat tried to close up, and I gulped hard against a wave of nausea. “Someone broke in? Are you hurt? Where’s Erin?”

A long pause, and in the background of the mute static, I could have sworn the humming sound cut out, as though whoever it was stopped their eerie melody all at once.

“She’s gone.” Something in Cindy’s tone changed, as if the fear drained away to a blank emotionless rasp, and the line went dead with a chilling *click.*

Every inch of my body racked with a shiver, and both feet seemed glued to the floor in a strange form of dread.

Like so many girls before them, Cindy Fadro and Erin Martinelli had been hired on to be caretakers and actors in the Wickenshire Living History Estate. Erin was 19, studying to be a nurse, while Cindy had just graduated high school and wanted to be a teacher. They were good kids, calm, intelligent, and great workers. Though I never had any children, they were like daughters of my own, and they even baked a cake for my birthday in June. Once they called me in for a leaky pipe, but only after they had done their best to fix it themselves with a tool kit I’d left in the stairwell cupboard. Smart little troopers that they were, the girls even had the common sense to shut the correct valve off and found the leak on their own. Had it been anyone else, I might have considered this to be a prank, a joke, some dumb idea made by bored kids to get a new video for their social media nonsense, but I knew Cindy and Erin.

They didn’t pull pranks like this.

Unnerved, I tried to redial her number but got no answer. Erin’s number yielded the same result, and I shook my head at myself.

*Screw it, I’m not taking any chances.*

I was midway through yanking my work boots on when the sheriff picked up.

*“Hello?”*

From the gruffness in his words, I could tell he’d been asleep as well, but I couldn’t waste time with the standard 911 procedures.

“David, it’s me.” I cinched down the laces on my boots and grabbed my Carhart jacket from its hook by the door. “Cindy just called from the Wickenshire place. There’s a fire on the mountain, and I think someone’s broken into the house. I’m headed there now.”

Rustling on the opposite end of the phone let me know David was up, likely going through the same motions as myself. The son of a Polish man and a Kootenai woman, David Kowolski and I had known each other since high school, and even played football on the same team. Nicknamed ‘White Cloud’ for his European features and Native American blood, he was stubborn with a quick temper, but tenacious when it came to his job. As a law man he drove his deputies relentlessly, backed them to the hilt when it came to any court battles, and as a result he’d managed to keep the crime in Jacob’s Fork quite low over the years. We didn’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I knew I could count on him when it came to something like this. If Cindy or Erin were in danger, Sheriff Kowolski would ride through hell and back to get them out, which was exactly the kind of man I needed right now.

*“I’ll get on the horn to a few of my boys and have them meet you there.”* He replied, and I heard the zipping of a coat on his end, along with the metallic *cha-click* of a handgun slide being racked. *“Fire teams are going to need time to get spun up, so whatever happens, don’t go wandering off without letting me know. Last thing I want is us getting caught in the flames if they decide to move down the mountain.”*

I nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see me and kept the phone pressed to my ear as I swiped my truck keys from the porcelain ashtray near the front door. “Got it.”

*“Be careful, Andy.”* His voice hitched in a low pause, as if the sheriff himself had as bad a feeling about this as I did, and he hung up.

Rain pattered on the windshield of my ancient pickup truck as I wound my way through the dark backroads of northern Idaho, the night sky black with the clouds of late fall. On the sun-faded seat next to me lay my work kit; a simple heavy duty canvas tool bag that held various tools, keys, a flashlight, and an old revolver handed down to me from my grandfather. I used the tools in my job every day as the groundskeeper, janitor, and fix-it-all handyman for the Wickenshire House, which had been part of our small town for as long as anyone could remember. Set on a picturesque 103 acres of fields and woodland in the shadow of the nearby Smoke Point Mountain, the Wickenshire House was a rare example of eastern architecture in the far reaches of the American West. It was the property of our town’s oldest resident, Mr. Edward J. Watkins, a kindly if forgetful soul who’d seen 91 years on this earth and still could drive his own car, though he had a little trouble with stairs. He lived in a cottage on the western edge of town, but I wasn’t about to call him at this time of night, even for something so urgent. Knowing Ed Watkins, he would try to drive out to the house with his slippers on and get hurt stumbling around in the flames.

*Or run into whatever scumbag is in the house, God forbid.*

On the horizon, some of the clouds began to glow, an orange flicker that widened on the mountainside as the distant fire spread. I could barely glimpse an odd plume of smoke in the sky, not curved upward from the fire but downward in a long arc, backlit by the flames. Looking at it, I had a momentary lapse of courage, my resolve wavering. Cindy had said something ‘fell from the sky’. This looked like a trail of some kind, maybe a crashed plane or a fallen weather balloon. If there was jet fuel on the ground, the fire would be even worse to put out than usual. It was horrible, rotten luck all the way around; a wildfire on the same night the house had its first break in, while the girls were there alone.

Adrenaline pumping, I sped up the lonely gravel trail to the house, one of the final sections of public roadways that got this close to the mountain. The Wickenshire House reared from the gloom ahead, its tall gates and Victorian gables illuminated by the dual halos of my truck’s headlights. It still took my breath away, the ornate beauty of the place, built as if every stone had been placed by a perfectionist’s hand. It stood at two stories in height, built from stone mined at the local quarry, with multiple chimneys, a balcony overlooking the back garden, and a grand front porch that wrapped halfway around the entire structure. A stone wall encircled the main grounds, with a wrought iron gate at the drive and several ornamental gardens interspersed throughout. Plush lawns stretched in between, and there were a few oak trees planted there for their brilliant colors in the fall. A small garage had been built around the back of the house sometime in the 1960’s, but this mainly held the riding lawnmower and a small shop where I did most of my repair work. Cindy and Erins’ cars were parked back there, the front gravel lot reserved for visitors during the daily tours. I didn’t see any other vehicle that the intruder might have used, but something else caught my attention in that moment, and held it with a pull like gravity.

*Lord have mercy.*

I stared, slack jawed, at a huge sea of flames that roared through the nearby trees with a voracious appetite. The fire hadn’t wasted any time, chewing through the wet growth as if the rain had never fell, evergreens crackling as they burned to dust in minutes. The heat came through my windshield in a steady increase, warm enough that I couldn’t tell the difference between the fire and my truck heater. The open grassy slopes around the house were consumed as the flames inched closer to the building, and fire closed in from both east and west.

Bounding from my truck, I dashed up to the front door and pulled the handles.

The polished brass knobs rattled but didn’t turn, the flames licking their way across the prairie grass outside the ornate courtyard walls.

*Locked. That means our scumbag didn’t break in through here. Maybe he went around the back?*

With shaking hands, I put down the canvas tool bag and dug in it for my key ring.

Sirens began to wail in the distance, and I finally managed to force the doors open, leaving the keys in the lock to snatch my aged pistol.

“Cindy!” I produced a flashlight with my left hand to hold it beneath my gun, and swept the beam of it over the murky interior. “Erin! Where are you?”

I’d been in the house countless times over the years, but in that moment it felt suffocating, like a great stony maw waiting for me to go far enough in so as to swallow me whole. The foyer led to a large room with a grand staircase, doorways on either side opening to the main dining room and a sitting room respectively. Signs and velvet ropes were posted to guide visitors through the proper areas, a gift shop in the rear of the house near the old parlor, along with guest bathrooms added on to the original back porch. With all the lights off, it looked alien, surreal for this part of the country with its eastern Victorian mystique, and my skin prickled at the sensation that there were eyes in every shadow. Of course, I had been stupid to yell. I’d let my panic get the better of me, and now I had given away the element of surprise. If some creep was in the house somewhere with Erin or Cindy, doing God-knows-what, I wouldn’t be able to sneak up on him now.

*Alright then, might as well move fast.*

With the old revolver grasped in my trembling hands, I headed for the stairs and took them three at a time. The wood creaked under my steps, ancient chestnut and oak that had been sawn before the Great Depression, each footfall like a cannon in the silent house. From here, the roar of the fire outside seemed a muffled whisper, as though there were two different realities, and the house stood guard between them. However, I remembered the heat coming through the windshield of my pickup and knew I didn’t have much time. Soon the house would be in flames, the fire outside enough to melt glass and ignite the wooden siding in minutes.

I reached the top of the stairs and swept my flashlight beam down both ends of the corridor at the top, uncertain of which direction to go first. Cindy and Erin were roomed down the hall to the left, but if someone had indeed broken into the house, Cindy might have hid somewhere else. Every second wasted could mean life or death, and I realized that either way, I’d be turning my back to the unknown.

Something flickered in the beam of my light, a brief whisp of shadow that jerked back behind the far corner of the right-side hallway. I didn’t have more than a moment to see clear details, but there was enough of an image burned into my mind that it came to me in a cold rush.

A face.

*Kowolski, you’d better get here soon.*

Swallowing, I paced down the hallway, my handgun leveled on the spot where the shadow had been.

Upon reaching it, I inched in a wide arc around the corner, bracing for a figure to jump out at me.

The air caught in my throat, and I stared at a section of wallpaper bathed in the aura of my flashlight.

Brownish-black sludge had been daubed on the wall, smeared into a perfect circle so that the excess dripped over the wallpaper like ebony tears. I couldn’t tell if it was mud, blood, or something else, but the corridor stank of rot and the putrid scent of stagnant water. Thorny bits of twig had been woven together, tied here and there with bits of plant fiber to form a circle that overlaid the sludge. Pasted together on the wall, these seemed to make up a protective ring, and in the middle were the handprints.

From what I could see, they were two different sizes, slender fingers and narrow palms indicating two younger females. Both prints faced downwards, slightly overlapping each other at the heel of the palm, and the thumbs arced toward one another like pincers. Unlike the grimy sludge, these were pressed to the old wallpaper in an unmistakable red hue, and it hit me what I was looking at.

*A spider.*

The four fingers of each hand made the legs, the thumbs its mandibles. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the blackness of the outer paste came from petals . . . rose petals to be exact. There were no roses growing in Idaho this time of year, and I’d never seen a natural black rose in my life, yet these appeared fresh. Most had been ground to a powder that gave the foul substance its dark color, others pushed into the muck like decorative flair, giving a strange, heady undertone to the mixture. With this discovery came more clarity; the thorny twigs glued into the circle were not random. They spread inward toward the spider, forming a sharp web of spikes that enshrined it, with the careful touch of an artisan. Such a display would have taken hours to make, certainly longer than the time it took for Cindy to call me. How was this possible?

*“Mr. Todd!”*

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the horrific cry echoing from somewhere behind me, Cindy’s voice tinged in pain and fear.

No sooner had I turned, running a short distance back toward the main corridor at the top of the stairs, and the voice cut out with a high, agonized scream.

“Cindy!” I charged toward the girls’ rooms, heart pounding in my chest.

*“Help me!”* Back in the direction of the symbol, Erin’s voice rang out, choked with sobs and full of torment. *“Mr. Todd, please!”*

Acidic bewilderment slithered through my mind, and I skidded to a stop, caught in the middle of the hallway, the staircase just to my left. I had been so close, perhaps a door away from Erin only moments ago. Could there be more than one intruder holding the girls in separate rooms?

*Cindy is closest. I have to get to her. She sounds like she’s hurt.*

Teeth gritted against the screams of Erin, I forced myself through the left side hallway, her voice ringing in my ears as she begged for my help.

At the end of the hall, I reached the rooms given to the girls and lunged for the handle to Cindy’s.

It didn’t turn, locked from the inside.

Backing up, I drove the heel of my boot into the door next to the lock and heard the old wood splinter. Any other time, I would have balked at such destruction, these doors being over 80 years old, but it didn’t matter anymore. What the fire didn’t get would not be worth Cindy or Erin’s lives.

The door swung open to slap against the bedroom wall, and I dashed inside, revolver in hand.

*What the . . .*

Within the quiet interior of the bedroom, everything looked untouched, the curtains partially open, the bed rumpled from where Cindy had gotten up to check the window, a discarded work uniform in the clothes hamper by the door. Dark stained wood trim lined the walls, windows, and doorway, the walls papered with a robin egg blue pattern that gave it an airy feeling. The white lacy curtains wafted like clouds in the slight draft that came in the open hallway door, and the vintage hot water heater gurgled in the corner as steam worked its way through the pipes. There were modern touches as well, more lamps and lights plugged into the discreet electrical outlets in the walls, a small television on its stand across from the bed, and a side door opened to a shared bathroom between Cindy’s room and Erin’s. This room wasn’t open to tourists, as it was the private living quarters for our workers, so such things were permissible here, as opposed to other parts of the house. Nothing seemed out of place, but there was no sign of Cindy anywhere, no clues to indicate that she’d been there moments ago. It was as if she’d gotten out of bed, looked out the window, and vanished into thin air.

In a flurry of movement, I checked under the bed, in the closet, and the bathroom. When those came back clean, I broke through the bathroom door into Erin’s room, only to find more of the same.

There was no sign of the girls anywhere.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* Erin’s screams continued from the opposite end of the long corridor, and I flung open the bedroom door to retrace my mad dash in her direction, confusion and frustration mounting.

Rounding the corner that bore the strange mark on the wall, I swayed to a stop on the old floorboards next to the door where her screams had come from and yanked on the knob.

*You’ve got to be kidding me . . . how many doors did they lock before I got here?*

With a gasp of exertion, I backed up to kick the door in like the last one, muscles tensed for the effort.

*“Mr. Todd!”* Cindy’s cries exploded from the doorway behind me, rabid and intense as the door rattles on its hinges like she was throwing herself against it from within the room.

I froze, staring at the door, heart racing as my mind whirled. How could she be in there? I’d heard Cindy on the other side of the house not five minutes ago. There was no way she could have moved that fast, not without going past me. I would have seen her in the hall, would have heard the ancient doors creaking on their hinges as they opened.

She couldn’t be in there.

*“Please, help me!”* Erin’s screams started up again, but this time from somewhere in the left-side hallway, and another door began to groan in muted *thuds* as if she too were trying to break it down.

A dry fear crept into my throat, different than what I’d known coming into the house. This didn’t make sense. Erin’s voice had been coming from the door I stood ready to break into, but now it was to my left. Cindy’s had been coming from her room in the west wing but now called from the door behind me. Neither could have left their respective rooms without entering the hall, and I knew for a fact that there weren’t any old-fashioned servant entrances anywhere that could have let them move unnoticed. Something was wrong, very wrong.

Shaken, I took a step away from the door that echoed with Cindy’s voice. “Cindy?”

*“Mr. Todd!”* She begged from the other side of the oak planking, the wood slamming against the jam with wild urgency. *“Please, help me! Please!”*

“The door is locked.” I tried not to hyperventilate as I watched the knob rattle in its socket, knowing fully well the lock was on her side of the door. “Can you let me in?”

Her wails increased in pitch, the screeches an awful combination of agony and terror that made my stomach churn. It sounded as if Cindy was being tormented in the worst ways imaginable, but something about the cadence of each shriek felt off, enough that my brain sent up warning alarms inside my skull.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* She pleaded once more, the same words both girls kept using in various rearrangements over and over, the door shuddering under each blow she made.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I sucked in a breath, eyes focused on the doorknob as it clacked back-and-forth, like Cindy wanted to open it but couldn’t. An uncanny thought rose in my mind, bone-chilling in its clarity, growing louder and louder so that it burst from me before I could stop it.

“Cindy,” I gripped my flashlight so hard that my knuckles turned white. “What’s my first name?”

Like a thunderclap, Cindy’s pleas ceased, along with Erin’s, so that the entire house fell into dead silence. Nothing moved, and even the muffled roar of the wildfire outside seemed deadened further than before, as though the house was a vacuum of sound. My skin crawled, the air thick in my lungs, and a strange certainty took hold of me that made the sense of dread even worse as Cindy’s words about Erin trickled through my brain.

*She’s gone.*

*Click.*

To my right, a doorknob at the far end of the hallway unlocked.

*Click.*

Another lock slid open, this one closer, the doors remaining shut as more joined them one-by-one.

*Click.*

*Click.*

*Click.*

A twinge of panic tightened in my throat, but I leveled the beam of my flashlight at the first door that had unlocked, blood surging in my temples. Everything seemed loud, the heartbeat in my chest, the breath in my lungs, the groan of the floorboards under my boots. My vision narrowed, a vibration hummed to life inside my skull, and I tasted metal on my tongue. In my hand, the flashlight began to flicker as if the batteries were struggling to remain lit, and I couldn’t lift the revolver, my arms refusing to move like the gun weighed as much as a car.

The locks carried on past me, every door on the second story unlocking itself in a continuous march, until at last, the final *click* resounded from the far hallway like cannon fire to my ears.

For a moment, the silence returned, so thick it may as well have been water.

*Wham.*

Every door on the second story flung open, impacting against the wall inside their respective rooms so hard that I heard plaster *crunch*, the hinges squealing on old dust.

With them came the screams.

There were hundreds of voices, some human, others less so, bellowing at the top of their lungs to be heard over one another. If they were saying any words, they were lost among the throng, a constant roar of vocals that soured in my ears for the sheer volume of it. Somewhere among the morass, I could barely catch the sound of Erin and Cindy’s voices shrieking with the others, a morbid choir of pain, suffering, and fear. It seemed to seep out of the floorboards, ooze from the heater vents, and rebound off the walls in every direction. With the doors open, the deep orange glow of the flames outside poured into the house like a tidal wave, but oddly enough no heat came with it, the hallway as cold as if I’d stepped into a freezer. The shadows elongated in the firelight, swaying as they inched up the papered walls, and a pungent smell followed them.

Roses.

It came with overpowering strength, sickly-sweet, but unmistakable. As the tide of shadows advanced down the hall toward me, the fermented stink of roses filled the air like poison gas, and I tasted copper on my lips.

*I have to get out of here.*

Coughing on the blood running from both nostrils, I stumbled toward the stairs, my head a mess of static. Like a tide of slithering vines, the inky shadows pursued me with ravenous hunger. I could feel their magnetic pull, the chorus of screams still ringing across the house with deafening volume, a terrible siren song that tugged at something deep within my subconscious. Voices, so many voices, begged me to stay, to go back, to find the darkest room and sink myself into the abyss until it drowned me.

Something tightened on my ankle just as I reached the top of the staircase, and I toppled headlong down the steps.

*Bam.*

My hip rammed into a banister, and I lost my grip on the pistol.

*Wham.*

Another step hit my shoulder, and I felt my teeth bite into my tongue, the flashlight clattering away into the floor below.

*Smack.*

My head connected with the floorboards at the landing, and the blackness threatened to close over my eyes for the last time.

*Creak.*

One of the steps flexed under the weight of a foot, and I gulped air in pain to squint at the shadows.

*Creak.*

Another footstep echoed toward me, something at the top of the steps descending with a slow, methodical gait. It didn’t sound heavy, not the deft pace of a large man or thick boot, but almost delicate, light, graceful. Yet, there was something about each carefully placed step, each sigh and squeak of the aged woodwork that made my skin wriggle. Something was coming, something that knew exactly where I was even in the pitch blackness of the house.

It was watching me, *stalking* me through the shadows like a cat with a mouse.

Desperate fear surged in my brain, and I clawed through the dark on my stomach to find a way out. I last remembered the front door being nearby, but it seemed to take an eternity to move across the cold floorboards, the unseen presence mere yards behind me as I wriggled forward.

At last, I managed to gain my footing, though it hurt to put weight on my right leg, and hurled myself forward in the blind shadows.

*Thud.*

Both front doors flew open, and I tumbled out onto the porch, rolling down the steps into the stones of the walkway.

Like a switch had been thrown, the world seemed to come alive once more, the cold sensation fading, the sound returning. Sirens wailed closer as headlights appeared in the long gravel driveway, and the crackle of flames roared from the trees. Smoke filled my nostrils, heat from the nearby fire licked over my skin, and I rolled onto my side to look back toward the house.

My lungs tightened, and I stared, unable to pull my eyes away.

Inside the open front doorway, nothing was visible, not the glint of firelight from inside, nor the faint glow of it coming through any ground windows. The entrance was a mass of impenetrable shadows that seemed to form a solid wall at the threshold, yet deep within that abyss, something stared back.

It had no shape, no form that I could identify it with, but there was definitely a presence that stood just beyond the light, watching me from the gloom. My eyes seemed fastened to it, either by my own primordial fear, or perhaps willed so by whatever peered out of the wretched expanse. A torrent of emotions ripped through my mind, warped and misshapen, like cold fingers pried at the taps of my humanity to unleash a maelstrom of feeling. Hunger and fear. Hate and despair. Lust and sadness. Grief and pain. They all rolled over one another, tumbling in and out of each other in a never-ending tide, and it hit me with a strangled form of clarity that these weren’t *my* emotions.

Locked in place by the unknown being’s gaze, I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as cry out, my only option to fight back with what little expression I had left.

*What are you?*

Something about my terrified thought seemed to strike a chord within the cascade of terrible shadow, for the next instant the doors on the house creaked in their wrought-iron hinges, and then swung shut on their own.

The rest of the night was a blur, a stupor, one that I wandered through in a mindless fog. Firefighting crews appeared from miles around to help put out the blaze, but not before it chewed through all 103 acres on the Wickenshire estate. Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was burned to cinders. Even boulders cracked from the intense heat, the smoke pall so large it could be seen from Montana, or so I heard. One of the fire trucks exploded when its fuel tank caught fire and killed three men. Everything burned . . . except the house.

For some reason, the fire stopped at the stone courtyard walls and went no further. In a blaze hot enough that it had turned some minor sandpits on the mountain to crude glass, there wasn’t so much as a scorch mark on the house or its outbuildings. None of the paint peeled, the siding wasn’t so much as warm to the touch, and all the plants withing the yard were unscathed. The investigators couldn’t even find ash on the roof from the fire afterwards, not a single flake. Unlike its ruined acreage, the Wickenshire House had survived the wildfire unharmed, and no one could make any sense of it.

Once the fire was finally put out, they took me to the local clinic for my injuries, a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and a concussion from my tumble down the stairs. Sheriff Kowolski visited in the morning to see how I was, and to fill me in on what I’d missed once they trucked me away from the site.

Over three hundred search and rescue volunteers had been called out, along with special forensics teams from neighboring counties, and they hadn’t found any sign of Cindy Fadro or Erin Martinelli. The last time they managed to ping Cindy’s phone via satellite, it had registered a mile up the slope from the house, but they never managed to recover the device. Tracking dogs refused to go near the house and seemed to lose all scent once they left the property boundaries. No trace of Erin was discovered, and no DNA could be found in either of the girls’ rooms to point to a culprit. One of the searchers claimed he had heard what sounded like a female voice screaming for help on the northern slope, but he wasn’t sure where it had come from, and no one else could verify it. Another man claimed he saw someone walking inside the tree line near the eastern edge of the property but never got a good glimpse at their face to see who they were. With all speculation bereft of evidence, it seemed to everyone that both Cindy and Erin had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Worse yet, when I described my account to the sheriff, he informed me that his team hadn’t found any symbols painted on the walls, nor did they see anything out of the ordinary. All they found that aligned with my story was the strange, overwhelming aroma of roses that permeated the house.

Nothing more.

That was six weeks ago. I got out of the clinic within a few days after the event, but the continued search efforts proved fruitless. With their investigation coming up cold, the sheriff’s office released the house back to Mr. Watkins, who closed it indefinitely. I had never seen him so distraught in my life, as Ed took the girls’ disappearance rather hard. He felt personally responsible, though we all knew there wasn’t anything he could have done, especially since no one knew what happened to Erin or Cindy. However, Ed apparently decided to go there himself late one evening to do some looking around the house and didn’t bother to tell anyone else. It wasn’t until his cleaning lady stopped by his cottage in Jacob’s Fork the next morning that Ed was reported missing, and police dispatched to the Wickenshire House.

They never found him.

His car was parked out front, the doors unlocked, but they couldn’t find a trace of Edward Watkins anywhere on the property. I helped with the search, as I basically slept in the sheriff’s office these days, and found no sign of a struggle or any other foul play, only the smell of roses. We dug deep this time, rifled through local records, archives, property history, everything we could get our hands on about the estate. There was nothing to indicate this place would be trouble, no forgotten building plans with hidden rooms, no land disputes with older tenants, no tribal issues from burial grounds or holy sites. The property was normal, and even when I poked around to see if there had been any deaths, suicides, or other sordid affairs associated with the house, my search came up blank. There was no reason for this to be happen, not from human effort, or anything else.

Even now, as December drags on, nothing has been the same. No plants grow in the burned zone, not even the smallest patch of liken or moss, as if the ground is poisoned to its core. Animals avoid it, so that the uncharred sections of forest around the property are empty, silent places. The access road is chained off to keep curious locals away, and Sheriff Kowolski let me bunk at a small ranger cabin at the base of the mountain just so I could keep tabs on the place. I think he knew I needed to be close, to keep an eye on the house, and keep looking for answers. I can’t explain why, but I know something is in there, waiting, biding its time. It failed to get me that night, but I have a terrible premonition that it doesn’t need *me*.

It just needs *more*.

I’ve found markers in the last few days. Piles of bones. Not haphazard from an animal kill, but stacked, organized, purposeful. Bits of twine made from plant fibers hold them together, and despite being in the open, no animals will bother them, not even the vultures. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, they think I can’t process the girls being gone, but I’ve stumbled on over a dozen of them now. They seemed to be set in a wide ring around the property line, spanning outward from the house into the forest beyond, capturing more territory by the day. No matter how many times I remove them, the piles always reappear, with fresh bones added to the stacks. I don’t touch them anymore, and I don’t even make eye contact with the empty eye sockets of the skulls. The few times I have, I heard whispers in my sleep, and had nightmares of eyes in the shadows of my room.

Some of the bones are like those of a rabbit or mole, while others are bigger like elk or bear. Every pile is topped with a skull, most of them from small game, but five of the piles hold unique skulls; a bear, a coyote, an eagle, a snake, and lastly, a great bull elk. They are laid out opposite one another ringing the house, the rest of the smaller markers ranging from them into the forest beyond. Of all the markers, the one with the elk skull is tallest, its full spread of antlers still intact so that it is nine feet high at the eye sockets. I found a symbol painted onto the bone forehead with powdered charcoal that the rain never seems to wash away, no matter how many times I go up to it.

A spider.

One made of two slender, inverted hands, both the same size.

I’m posting this so that it’s on record, in case one of these days I don’t come back from that mountain. Service was always spotty up there before, but ever since that night, it’s been non-existent. Even the few trail cameras I’ve put out have either gone dead or produced nothing but blurry photos. Something is building these markers, watching me whenever I walk the perimeter, and shifting in the corners of my vision whenever I turn my head. I’ve discovered trail signs that have been purposefully moved to misdirect me. Sometimes I hear screams in the woods, distant and warped, but they sound like Erin’s cries. I see flashes of blonde hair in the bushes that I want to believe is Cindy, but I know it can’t be.

They’re gone, both of them.

Only the sheriff understands, even if he doesn’t say much to that effect. I can see it in his eyes, he knows that I’m telling the truth, and his own deputies have been up to the house to see the piles multiple times. There’s nothing they can do, nothing but wait from the valley below and hope that the snow buries whatever it is for the winter.

There’s something wrong with the Wickenshire House, something *inside* it, something unseen that walks the grounds day and night. It wants more than the estate, I can feel it, can taste it in the wind, hear it in the dry crunch of snow under my boots, and feel it in the shivers I get every time I look at the dark, barren windows of that cursed structure.

It wants the forest, the trees, the mountain.

It wants *everything*.",1,1765834375.0,Wholesomenosleep,0,1.0,False
1pnjng4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1pnjng4/opinions/,Opinions..,"37 yo male. So when I was about 15-16 I had my gallbladder removed due to stones. My BMs were terrible for years into my mid 20s where I learned what irritated my stomach and was able to somewhat manage it. Fast forward to about 6 months ago, I’ve been having looser stools, not liquid but not solid, something in between. I call it oatmeal poops…similar consistency. Following this timeframe, I’ve had excessive gas that smell putrid. Extremely sulfuric. I got overly bloated right after a larger meal and my BMs are very inconsistent as far as how often. I quit smoking cigarettes exactly a year ago and picked up nicotine pouches. I’m also a frequent drinker. Usually 2 drinks a night and have for years. One of the things that has helped w my gallbladder removal symptoms was intermittent fasting. One meal a day and usually in the evening. About 2-3 weeks ago I got frustrated with the gas smell and started doing an elimination diet. Gave up alcohol and almost all dairy, with just cream in my coffee. Doing tons of research I came across SIBO and it seems to sort of align with my symptoms. I also read some forums of people having issues with nicotine pouches wrecking their guts. If I am strict to my intermittent fasting and eat dairy free in the evening, I have almost zero stomach issues with almost no gas and zero smell. This morning I treated myself to a latte while running errands and after a few hours, gas started up and smells putrid again after the entire week no issues. Does this sound similar to sibo? Maybe developing a lactose intolerance issue later in life? Has anybody heard of nicotine pouches potentially wiping out the gut biome?? I’m sort of at a loss and I’m a huge believer in managing stuff on my own before seeing a doctor if it doesn’t seem life threatening.

*Getting too old for this.*

In front of my ragged couch, the TV continued with its black and white parade of old footage from a World War One documentary, though the war seemed nearly over now. Judging by the digital clock on the mantelpiece, which read 3:49 AM, I’d been asleep for at least five hours. My body ached, a familiar problem at my age, but enough that I chided myself for not going to bed earlier like a responsible person. It had been a long day, so I came home to a cold shower, a few hot dogs warmed in the microwave and settled down to watch some television before bed. Of course, at 55 years old I’d misjudged how tired I really was and spent close to half the night slumped on my sofa, which meant I would be paying for it in the morning with stiff joints and a sore back.

Palming my cracked Motorola from the coffee table, I found the TV remote and hit the *mute* button as I answered the call. “Hello?”

Shaky breathing grated on the other end, and after a few moments, a girl’s hushed voice whispered through. “Mr. Todd?”

Ice rippled through my veins at the sound of Cindy’s panicked voice, and I sat up straighter to rub at my bleary eyes. “Yeah, I’m here. You okay? What’s wrong?”

Silence greeted me, a strange mix of static, trembling breaths, and what sounded like sniffles as she tried to hold back tears. “Please . . . help me.”

“Cindy?” Concern building in my mind, I switched on a nearby lamp and pulled myself from the couch with a grunt at the tightness in my lower back. “You there? What’s going on?”

More shaky gasps followed, and just over the static, I thought I heard the faint sound of melodic humming in the background.

“Something’s wrong.” Cindy whispered, her words so quiet that they made each breath sound like cannon fire. “T-The woods are . . . something fell out of the sky and . . . it was so loud, it woke me up. There’s a fire.”

Brow furrowed, I moved fast for the kitchen, stumbling through the dark interior of my little cabin to grope for the light switch. “Stay calm, just stay calm and talk to me. You said there’s a fire? How far away? Can you get to your car?”

Another sniffle came through, clogged with harsh interference as the signal weakened, a sound that made my veins throb with tension. “I-I can’t. Something’s here, it’s in the house, it’s *in the house with me*. W-We can’t get out.”

My throat tried to close up, and I gulped hard against a wave of nausea. “Someone broke in? Are you hurt? Where’s Erin?”

A long pause, and in the background of the mute static, I could have sworn the humming sound cut out, as though whoever it was stopped their eerie melody all at once.

“She’s gone.” Something in Cindy’s tone changed, as if the fear drained away to a blank emotionless rasp, and the line went dead with a chilling *click.*

Every inch of my body racked with a shiver, and both feet seemed glued to the floor in a strange form of dread.

Like so many girls before them, Cindy Fadro and Erin Martinelli had been hired on to be caretakers and actors in the Wickenshire Living History Estate. Erin was 19, studying to be a nurse, while Cindy had just graduated high school and wanted to be a teacher. They were good kids, calm, intelligent, and great workers. Though I never had any children, they were like daughters of my own, and they even baked a cake for my birthday in June. Once they called me in for a leaky pipe, but only after they had done their best to fix it themselves with a tool kit I’d left in the stairwell cupboard. Smart little troopers that they were, the girls even had the common sense to shut the correct valve off and found the leak on their own. Had it been anyone else, I might have considered this to be a prank, a joke, some dumb idea made by bored kids to get a new video for their social media nonsense, but I knew Cindy and Erin.

They didn’t pull pranks like this.

Unnerved, I tried to redial her number but got no answer. Erin’s number yielded the same result, and I shook my head at myself.

*Screw it, I’m not taking any chances.*

I was midway through yanking my work boots on when the sheriff picked up.

*“Hello?”*

From the gruffness in his words, I could tell he’d been asleep as well, but I couldn’t waste time with the standard 911 procedures.

“David, it’s me.” I cinched down the laces on my boots and grabbed my Carhart jacket from its hook by the door. “Cindy just called from the Wickenshire place. There’s a fire on the mountain, and I think someone’s broken into the house. I’m headed there now.”

Rustling on the opposite end of the phone let me know David was up, likely going through the same motions as myself. The son of a Polish man and a Kootenai woman, David Kowolski and I had known each other since high school, and even played football on the same team. Nicknamed ‘White Cloud’ for his European features and Native American blood, he was stubborn with a quick temper, but tenacious when it came to his job. As a law man he drove his deputies relentlessly, backed them to the hilt when it came to any court battles, and as a result he’d managed to keep the crime in Jacob’s Fork quite low over the years. We didn’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I knew I could count on him when it came to something like this. If Cindy or Erin were in danger, Sheriff Kowolski would ride through hell and back to get them out, which was exactly the kind of man I needed right now.

*“I’ll get on the horn to a few of my boys and have them meet you there.”* He replied, and I heard the zipping of a coat on his end, along with the metallic *cha-click* of a handgun slide being racked. *“Fire teams are going to need time to get spun up, so whatever happens, don’t go wandering off without letting me know. Last thing I want is us getting caught in the flames if they decide to move down the mountain.”*

I nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see me and kept the phone pressed to my ear as I swiped my truck keys from the porcelain ashtray near the front door. “Got it.”

*“Be careful, Andy.”* His voice hitched in a low pause, as if the sheriff himself had as bad a feeling about this as I did, and he hung up.

Rain pattered on the windshield of my ancient pickup truck as I wound my way through the dark backroads of northern Idaho, the night sky black with the clouds of late fall. On the sun-faded seat next to me lay my work kit; a simple heavy duty canvas tool bag that held various tools, keys, a flashlight, and an old revolver handed down to me from my grandfather. I used the tools in my job every day as the groundskeeper, janitor, and fix-it-all handyman for the Wickenshire House, which had been part of our small town for as long as anyone could remember. Set on a picturesque 103 acres of fields and woodland in the shadow of the nearby Smoke Point Mountain, the Wickenshire House was a rare example of eastern architecture in the far reaches of the American West. It was the property of our town’s oldest resident, Mr. Edward J. Watkins, a kindly if forgetful soul who’d seen 91 years on this earth and still could drive his own car, though he had a little trouble with stairs. He lived in a cottage on the western edge of town, but I wasn’t about to call him at this time of night, even for something so urgent. Knowing Ed Watkins, he would try to drive out to the house with his slippers on and get hurt stumbling around in the flames.

*Or run into whatever scumbag is in the house, God forbid.*

On the horizon, some of the clouds began to glow, an orange flicker that widened on the mountainside as the distant fire spread. I could barely glimpse an odd plume of smoke in the sky, not curved upward from the fire but downward in a long arc, backlit by the flames. Looking at it, I had a momentary lapse of courage, my resolve wavering. Cindy had said something ‘fell from the sky’. This looked like a trail of some kind, maybe a crashed plane or a fallen weather balloon. If there was jet fuel on the ground, the fire would be even worse to put out than usual. It was horrible, rotten luck all the way around; a wildfire on the same night the house had its first break in, while the girls were there alone.

Adrenaline pumping, I sped up the lonely gravel trail to the house, one of the final sections of public roadways that got this close to the mountain. The Wickenshire House reared from the gloom ahead, its tall gates and Victorian gables illuminated by the dual halos of my truck’s headlights. It still took my breath away, the ornate beauty of the place, built as if every stone had been placed by a perfectionist’s hand. It stood at two stories in height, built from stone mined at the local quarry, with multiple chimneys, a balcony overlooking the back garden, and a grand front porch that wrapped halfway around the entire structure. A stone wall encircled the main grounds, with a wrought iron gate at the drive and several ornamental gardens interspersed throughout. Plush lawns stretched in between, and there were a few oak trees planted there for their brilliant colors in the fall. A small garage had been built around the back of the house sometime in the 1960’s, but this mainly held the riding lawnmower and a small shop where I did most of my repair work. Cindy and Erins’ cars were parked back there, the front gravel lot reserved for visitors during the daily tours. I didn’t see any other vehicle that the intruder might have used, but something else caught my attention in that moment, and held it with a pull like gravity.

*Lord have mercy.*

I stared, slack jawed, at a huge sea of flames that roared through the nearby trees with a voracious appetite. The fire hadn’t wasted any time, chewing through the wet growth as if the rain had never fell, evergreens crackling as they burned to dust in minutes. The heat came through my windshield in a steady increase, warm enough that I couldn’t tell the difference between the fire and my truck heater. The open grassy slopes around the house were consumed as the flames inched closer to the building, and fire closed in from both east and west.

Bounding from my truck, I dashed up to the front door and pulled the handles.

The polished brass knobs rattled but didn’t turn, the flames licking their way across the prairie grass outside the ornate courtyard walls.

*Locked. That means our scumbag didn’t break in through here. Maybe he went around the back?*

With shaking hands, I put down the canvas tool bag and dug in it for my key ring.

Sirens began to wail in the distance, and I finally managed to force the doors open, leaving the keys in the lock to snatch my aged pistol.

“Cindy!” I produced a flashlight with my left hand to hold it beneath my gun, and swept the beam of it over the murky interior. “Erin! Where are you?”

I’d been in the house countless times over the years, but in that moment it felt suffocating, like a great stony maw waiting for me to go far enough in so as to swallow me whole. The foyer led to a large room with a grand staircase, doorways on either side opening to the main dining room and a sitting room respectively. Signs and velvet ropes were posted to guide visitors through the proper areas, a gift shop in the rear of the house near the old parlor, along with guest bathrooms added on to the original back porch. With all the lights off, it looked alien, surreal for this part of the country with its eastern Victorian mystique, and my skin prickled at the sensation that there were eyes in every shadow. Of course, I had been stupid to yell. I’d let my panic get the better of me, and now I had given away the element of surprise. If some creep was in the house somewhere with Erin or Cindy, doing God-knows-what, I wouldn’t be able to sneak up on him now.

*Alright then, might as well move fast.*

With the old revolver grasped in my trembling hands, I headed for the stairs and took them three at a time. The wood creaked under my steps, ancient chestnut and oak that had been sawn before the Great Depression, each footfall like a cannon in the silent house. From here, the roar of the fire outside seemed a muffled whisper, as though there were two different realities, and the house stood guard between them. However, I remembered the heat coming through the windshield of my pickup and knew I didn’t have much time. Soon the house would be in flames, the fire outside enough to melt glass and ignite the wooden siding in minutes.

I reached the top of the stairs and swept my flashlight beam down both ends of the corridor at the top, uncertain of which direction to go first. Cindy and Erin were roomed down the hall to the left, but if someone had indeed broken into the house, Cindy might have hid somewhere else. Every second wasted could mean life or death, and I realized that either way, I’d be turning my back to the unknown.

Something flickered in the beam of my light, a brief whisp of shadow that jerked back behind the far corner of the right-side hallway. I didn’t have more than a moment to see clear details, but there was enough of an image burned into my mind that it came to me in a cold rush.

A face.

*Kowolski, you’d better get here soon.*

Swallowing, I paced down the hallway, my handgun leveled on the spot where the shadow had been.

Upon reaching it, I inched in a wide arc around the corner, bracing for a figure to jump out at me.

The air caught in my throat, and I stared at a section of wallpaper bathed in the aura of my flashlight.

Brownish-black sludge had been daubed on the wall, smeared into a perfect circle so that the excess dripped over the wallpaper like ebony tears. I couldn’t tell if it was mud, blood, or something else, but the corridor stank of rot and the putrid scent of stagnant water. Thorny bits of twig had been woven together, tied here and there with bits of plant fiber to form a circle that overlaid the sludge. Pasted together on the wall, these seemed to make up a protective ring, and in the middle were the handprints.

From what I could see, they were two different sizes, slender fingers and narrow palms indicating two younger females. Both prints faced downwards, slightly overlapping each other at the heel of the palm, and the thumbs arced toward one another like pincers. Unlike the grimy sludge, these were pressed to the old wallpaper in an unmistakable red hue, and it hit me what I was looking at.

*A spider.*

The four fingers of each hand made the legs, the thumbs its mandibles. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the blackness of the outer paste came from petals . . . rose petals to be exact. There were no roses growing in Idaho this time of year, and I’d never seen a natural black rose in my life, yet these appeared fresh. Most had been ground to a powder that gave the foul substance its dark color, others pushed into the muck like decorative flair, giving a strange, heady undertone to the mixture. With this discovery came more clarity; the thorny twigs glued into the circle were not random. They spread inward toward the spider, forming a sharp web of spikes that enshrined it, with the careful touch of an artisan. Such a display would have taken hours to make, certainly longer than the time it took for Cindy to call me. How was this possible?

*“Mr. Todd!”*

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the horrific cry echoing from somewhere behind me, Cindy’s voice tinged in pain and fear.

No sooner had I turned, running a short distance back toward the main corridor at the top of the stairs, and the voice cut out with a high, agonized scream.

“Cindy!” I charged toward the girls’ rooms, heart pounding in my chest.

*“Help me!”* Back in the direction of the symbol, Erin’s voice rang out, choked with sobs and full of torment. *“Mr. Todd, please!”*

Acidic bewilderment slithered through my mind, and I skidded to a stop, caught in the middle of the hallway, the staircase just to my left. I had been so close, perhaps a door away from Erin only moments ago. Could there be more than one intruder holding the girls in separate rooms?

*Cindy is closest. I have to get to her. She sounds like she’s hurt.*

Teeth gritted against the screams of Erin, I forced myself through the left side hallway, her voice ringing in my ears as she begged for my help.

At the end of the hall, I reached the rooms given to the girls and lunged for the handle to Cindy’s.

It didn’t turn, locked from the inside.

Backing up, I drove the heel of my boot into the door next to the lock and heard the old wood splinter. Any other time, I would have balked at such destruction, these doors being over 80 years old, but it didn’t matter anymore. What the fire didn’t get would not be worth Cindy or Erin’s lives.

The door swung open to slap against the bedroom wall, and I dashed inside, revolver in hand.

*What the . . .*

Within the quiet interior of the bedroom, everything looked untouched, the curtains partially open, the bed rumpled from where Cindy had gotten up to check the window, a discarded work uniform in the clothes hamper by the door. Dark stained wood trim lined the walls, windows, and doorway, the walls papered with a robin egg blue pattern that gave it an airy feeling. The white lacy curtains wafted like clouds in the slight draft that came in the open hallway door, and the vintage hot water heater gurgled in the corner as steam worked its way through the pipes. There were modern touches as well, more lamps and lights plugged into the discreet electrical outlets in the walls, a small television on its stand across from the bed, and a side door opened to a shared bathroom between Cindy’s room and Erin’s. This room wasn’t open to tourists, as it was the private living quarters for our workers, so such things were permissible here, as opposed to other parts of the house. Nothing seemed out of place, but there was no sign of Cindy anywhere, no clues to indicate that she’d been there moments ago. It was as if she’d gotten out of bed, looked out the window, and vanished into thin air.

In a flurry of movement, I checked under the bed, in the closet, and the bathroom. When those came back clean, I broke through the bathroom door into Erin’s room, only to find more of the same.

There was no sign of the girls anywhere.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* Erin’s screams continued from the opposite end of the long corridor, and I flung open the bedroom door to retrace my mad dash in her direction, confusion and frustration mounting.

Rounding the corner that bore the strange mark on the wall, I swayed to a stop on the old floorboards next to the door where her screams had come from and yanked on the knob.

*You’ve got to be kidding me . . . how many doors did they lock before I got here?*

With a gasp of exertion, I backed up to kick the door in like the last one, muscles tensed for the effort.

*“Mr. Todd!”* Cindy’s cries exploded from the doorway behind me, rabid and intense as the door rattles on its hinges like she was throwing herself against it from within the room.

I froze, staring at the door, heart racing as my mind whirled. How could she be in there? I’d heard Cindy on the other side of the house not five minutes ago. There was no way she could have moved that fast, not without going past me. I would have seen her in the hall, would have heard the ancient doors creaking on their hinges as they opened.

She couldn’t be in there.

*“Please, help me!”* Erin’s screams started up again, but this time from somewhere in the left-side hallway, and another door began to groan in muted *thuds* as if she too were trying to break it down.

A dry fear crept into my throat, different than what I’d known coming into the house. This didn’t make sense. Erin’s voice had been coming from the door I stood ready to break into, but now it was to my left. Cindy’s had been coming from her room in the west wing but now called from the door behind me. Neither could have left their respective rooms without entering the hall, and I knew for a fact that there weren’t any old-fashioned servant entrances anywhere that could have let them move unnoticed. Something was wrong, very wrong.

Shaken, I took a step away from the door that echoed with Cindy’s voice. “Cindy?”

*“Mr. Todd!”* She begged from the other side of the oak planking, the wood slamming against the jam with wild urgency. *“Please, help me! Please!”*

“The door is locked.” I tried not to hyperventilate as I watched the knob rattle in its socket, knowing fully well the lock was on her side of the door. “Can you let me in?”

Her wails increased in pitch, the screeches an awful combination of agony and terror that made my stomach churn. It sounded as if Cindy was being tormented in the worst ways imaginable, but something about the cadence of each shriek felt off, enough that my brain sent up warning alarms inside my skull.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* She pleaded once more, the same words both girls kept using in various rearrangements over and over, the door shuddering under each blow she made.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I sucked in a breath, eyes focused on the doorknob as it clacked back-and-forth, like Cindy wanted to open it but couldn’t. An uncanny thought rose in my mind, bone-chilling in its clarity, growing louder and louder so that it burst from me before I could stop it.

“Cindy,” I gripped my flashlight so hard that my knuckles turned white. “What’s my first name?”

Like a thunderclap, Cindy’s pleas ceased, along with Erin’s, so that the entire house fell into dead silence. Nothing moved, and even the muffled roar of the wildfire outside seemed deadened further than before, as though the house was a vacuum of sound. My skin crawled, the air thick in my lungs, and a strange certainty took hold of me that made the sense of dread even worse as Cindy’s words about Erin trickled through my brain.

*She’s gone.*

*Click.*

To my right, a doorknob at the far end of the hallway unlocked.

*Click.*

Another lock slid open, this one closer, the doors remaining shut as more joined them one-by-one.

*Click.*

*Click.*

*Click.*

A twinge of panic tightened in my throat, but I leveled the beam of my flashlight at the first door that had unlocked, blood surging in my temples. Everything seemed loud, the heartbeat in my chest, the breath in my lungs, the groan of the floorboards under my boots. My vision narrowed, a vibration hummed to life inside my skull, and I tasted metal on my tongue. In my hand, the flashlight began to flicker as if the batteries were struggling to remain lit, and I couldn’t lift the revolver, my arms refusing to move like the gun weighed as much as a car.

The locks carried on past me, every door on the second story unlocking itself in a continuous march, until at last, the final *click* resounded from the far hallway like cannon fire to my ears.

For a moment, the silence returned, so thick it may as well have been water.

*Wham.*

Every door on the second story flung open, impacting against the wall inside their respective rooms so hard that I heard plaster *crunch*, the hinges squealing on old dust.

With them came the screams.

There were hundreds of voices, some human, others less so, bellowing at the top of their lungs to be heard over one another. If they were saying any words, they were lost among the throng, a constant roar of vocals that soured in my ears for the sheer volume of it. Somewhere among the morass, I could barely catch the sound of Erin and Cindy’s voices shrieking with the others, a morbid choir of pain, suffering, and fear. It seemed to seep out of the floorboards, ooze from the heater vents, and rebound off the walls in every direction. With the doors open, the deep orange glow of the flames outside poured into the house like a tidal wave, but oddly enough no heat came with it, the hallway as cold as if I’d stepped into a freezer. The shadows elongated in the firelight, swaying as they inched up the papered walls, and a pungent smell followed them.

Roses.

It came with overpowering strength, sickly-sweet, but unmistakable. As the tide of shadows advanced down the hall toward me, the fermented stink of roses filled the air like poison gas, and I tasted copper on my lips.

*I have to get out of here.*

Coughing on the blood running from both nostrils, I stumbled toward the stairs, my head a mess of static. Like a tide of slithering vines, the inky shadows pursued me with ravenous hunger. I could feel their magnetic pull, the chorus of screams still ringing across the house with deafening volume, a terrible siren song that tugged at something deep within my subconscious. Voices, so many voices, begged me to stay, to go back, to find the darkest room and sink myself into the abyss until it drowned me.

Something tightened on my ankle just as I reached the top of the staircase, and I toppled headlong down the steps.

*Bam.*

My hip rammed into a banister, and I lost my grip on the pistol.

*Wham.*

Another step hit my shoulder, and I felt my teeth bite into my tongue, the flashlight clattering away into the floor below.

*Smack.*

My head connected with the floorboards at the landing, and the blackness threatened to close over my eyes for the last time.

*Creak.*

One of the steps flexed under the weight of a foot, and I gulped air in pain to squint at the shadows.

*Creak.*

Another footstep echoed toward me, something at the top of the steps descending with a slow, methodical gait. It didn’t sound heavy, not the deft pace of a large man or thick boot, but almost delicate, light, graceful. Yet, there was something about each carefully placed step, each sigh and squeak of the aged woodwork that made my skin wriggle. Something was coming, something that knew exactly where I was even in the pitch blackness of the house.

It was watching me, *stalking* me through the shadows like a cat with a mouse.

Desperate fear surged in my brain, and I clawed through the dark on my stomach to find a way out. I last remembered the front door being nearby, but it seemed to take an eternity to move across the cold floorboards, the unseen presence mere yards behind me as I wriggled forward.

At last, I managed to gain my footing, though it hurt to put weight on my right leg, and hurled myself forward in the blind shadows.

*Thud.*

Both front doors flew open, and I tumbled out onto the porch, rolling down the steps into the stones of the walkway.

Like a switch had been thrown, the world seemed to come alive once more, the cold sensation fading, the sound returning. Sirens wailed closer as headlights appeared in the long gravel driveway, and the crackle of flames roared from the trees. Smoke filled my nostrils, heat from the nearby fire licked over my skin, and I rolled onto my side to look back toward the house.

My lungs tightened, and I stared, unable to pull my eyes away.

Inside the open front doorway, nothing was visible, not the glint of firelight from inside, nor the faint glow of it coming through any ground windows. The entrance was a mass of impenetrable shadows that seemed to form a solid wall at the threshold, yet deep within that abyss, something stared back.

It had no shape, no form that I could identify it with, but there was definitely a presence that stood just beyond the light, watching me from the gloom. My eyes seemed fastened to it, either by my own primordial fear, or perhaps willed so by whatever peered out of the wretched expanse. A torrent of emotions ripped through my mind, warped and misshapen, like cold fingers pried at the taps of my humanity to unleash a maelstrom of feeling. Hunger and fear. Hate and despair. Lust and sadness. Grief and pain. They all rolled over one another, tumbling in and out of each other in a never-ending tide, and it hit me with a strangled form of clarity that these weren’t *my* emotions.

Locked in place by the unknown being’s gaze, I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as cry out, my only option to fight back with what little expression I had left.

*What are you?*

Something about my terrified thought seemed to strike a chord within the cascade of terrible shadow, for the next instant the doors on the house creaked in their wrought-iron hinges, and then swung shut on their own.

The rest of the night was a blur, a stupor, one that I wandered through in a mindless fog. Firefighting crews appeared from miles around to help put out the blaze, but not before it chewed through all 103 acres on the Wickenshire estate. Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was burned to cinders. Even boulders cracked from the intense heat, the smoke pall so large it could be seen from Montana, or so I heard. One of the fire trucks exploded when its fuel tank caught fire and killed three men. Everything burned . . . except the house.

For some reason, the fire stopped at the stone courtyard walls and went no further. In a blaze hot enough that it had turned some minor sandpits on the mountain to crude glass, there wasn’t so much as a scorch mark on the house or its outbuildings. None of the paint peeled, the siding wasn’t so much as warm to the touch, and all the plants withing the yard were unscathed. The investigators couldn’t even find ash on the roof from the fire afterwards, not a single flake. Unlike its ruined acreage, the Wickenshire House had survived the wildfire unharmed, and no one could make any sense of it.

Once the fire was finally put out, they took me to the local clinic for my injuries, a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and a concussion from my tumble down the stairs. Sheriff Kowolski visited in the morning to see how I was, and to fill me in on what I’d missed once they trucked me away from the site.

Over three hundred search and rescue volunteers had been called out, along with special forensics teams from neighboring counties, and they hadn’t found any sign of Cindy Fadro or Erin Martinelli. The last time they managed to ping Cindy’s phone via satellite, it had registered a mile up the slope from the house, but they never managed to recover the device. Tracking dogs refused to go near the house and seemed to lose all scent once they left the property boundaries. No trace of Erin was discovered, and no DNA could be found in either of the girls’ rooms to point to a culprit. One of the searchers claimed he had heard what sounded like a female voice screaming for help on the northern slope, but he wasn’t sure where it had come from, and no one else could verify it. Another man claimed he saw someone walking inside the tree line near the eastern edge of the property but never got a good glimpse at their face to see who they were. With all speculation bereft of evidence, it seemed to everyone that both Cindy and Erin had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Worse yet, when I described my account to the sheriff, he informed me that his team hadn’t found any symbols painted on the walls, nor did they see anything out of the ordinary. All they found that aligned with my story was the strange, overwhelming aroma of roses that permeated the house.

Nothing more.

That was six weeks ago. I got out of the clinic within a few days after the event, but the continued search efforts proved fruitless. With their investigation coming up cold, the sheriff’s office released the house back to Mr. Watkins, who closed it indefinitely. I had never seen him so distraught in my life, as Ed took the girls’ disappearance rather hard. He felt personally responsible, though we all knew there wasn’t anything he could have done, especially since no one knew what happened to Erin or Cindy. However, Ed apparently decided to go there himself late one evening to do some looking around the house and didn’t bother to tell anyone else. It wasn’t until his cleaning lady stopped by his cottage in Jacob’s Fork the next morning that Ed was reported missing, and police dispatched to the Wickenshire House.

They never found him.

His car was parked out front, the doors unlocked, but they couldn’t find a trace of Edward Watkins anywhere on the property. I helped with the search, as I basically slept in the sheriff’s office these days, and found no sign of a struggle or any other foul play, only the smell of roses. We dug deep this time, rifled through local records, archives, property history, everything we could get our hands on about the estate. There was nothing to indicate this place would be trouble, no forgotten building plans with hidden rooms, no land disputes with older tenants, no tribal issues from burial grounds or holy sites. The property was normal, and even when I poked around to see if there had been any deaths, suicides, or other sordid affairs associated with the house, my search came up blank. There was no reason for this to be happen, not from human effort, or anything else.

Even now, as December drags on, nothing has been the same. No plants grow in the burned zone, not even the smallest patch of liken or moss, as if the ground is poisoned to its core. Animals avoid it, so that the uncharred sections of forest around the property are empty, silent places. The access road is chained off to keep curious locals away, and Sheriff Kowolski let me bunk at a small ranger cabin at the base of the mountain just so I could keep tabs on the place. I think he knew I needed to be close, to keep an eye on the house, and keep looking for answers. I can’t explain why, but I know something is in there, waiting, biding its time. It failed to get me that night, but I have a terrible premonition that it doesn’t need *me*.

It just needs *more*.

I’ve found markers in the last few days. Piles of bones. Not haphazard from an animal kill, but stacked, organized, purposeful. Bits of twine made from plant fibers hold them together, and despite being in the open, no animals will bother them, not even the vultures. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, they think I can’t process the girls being gone, but I’ve stumbled on over a dozen of them now. They seemed to be set in a wide ring around the property line, spanning outward from the house into the forest beyond, capturing more territory by the day. No matter how many times I remove them, the piles always reappear, with fresh bones added to the stacks. I don’t touch them anymore, and I don’t even make eye contact with the empty eye sockets of the skulls. The few times I have, I heard whispers in my sleep, and had nightmares of eyes in the shadows of my room.

Some of the bones are like those of a rabbit or mole, while others are bigger like elk or bear. Every pile is topped with a skull, most of them from small game, but five of the piles hold unique skulls; a bear, a coyote, an eagle, a snake, and lastly, a great bull elk. They are laid out opposite one another ringing the house, the rest of the smaller markers ranging from them into the forest beyond. Of all the markers, the one with the elk skull is tallest, its full spread of antlers still intact so that it is nine feet high at the eye sockets. I found a symbol painted onto the bone forehead with powdered charcoal that the rain never seems to wash away, no matter how many times I go up to it.

A spider.

One made of two slender, inverted hands, both the same size.

I’m posting this so that it’s on record, in case one of these days I don’t come back from that mountain. Service was always spotty up there before, but ever since that night, it’s been non-existent. Even the few trail cameras I’ve put out have either gone dead or produced nothing but blurry photos. Something is building these markers, watching me whenever I walk the perimeter, and shifting in the corners of my vision whenever I turn my head. I’ve discovered trail signs that have been purposefully moved to misdirect me. Sometimes I hear screams in the woods, distant and warped, but they sound like Erin’s cries. I see flashes of blonde hair in the bushes that I want to believe is Cindy, but I know it can’t be.

They’re gone, both of them.

Only the sheriff understands, even if he doesn’t say much to that effect. I can see it in his eyes, he knows that I’m telling the truth, and his own deputies have been up to the house to see the piles multiple times. There’s nothing they can do, nothing but wait from the valley below and hope that the snow buries whatever it is for the winter.

There’s something wrong with the Wickenshire House, something *inside* it, something unseen that walks the grounds day and night. It wants more than the estate, I can feel it, can taste it in the wind, hear it in the dry crunch of snow under my boots, and feel it in the shivers I get every time I look at the dark, barren windows of that cursed structure.

It wants the forest, the trees, the mountain.

It wants *everything*.",1,1765834198.0,WritersOfHorror,0,1.0,False

*Getting too old for this.*

In front of my ragged couch, the TV continued with its black and white parade of old footage from a World War One documentary, though the war seemed nearly over now. Judging by the digital clock on the mantelpiece, which read 3:49 AM, I’d been asleep for at least five hours. My body ached, a familiar problem at my age, but enough that I chided myself for not going to bed earlier like a responsible person. It had been a long day, so I came home to a cold shower, a few hot dogs warmed in the microwave and settled down to watch some television before bed. Of course, at 55 years old I’d misjudged how tired I really was and spent close to half the night slumped on my sofa, which meant I would be paying for it in the morning with stiff joints and a sore back.

Palming my cracked Motorola from the coffee table, I found the TV remote and hit the *mute* button as I answered the call. “Hello?”

Shaky breathing grated on the other end, and after a few moments, a girl’s hushed voice whispered through. “Mr. Todd?”

Ice rippled through my veins at the sound of Cindy’s panicked voice, and I sat up straighter to rub at my bleary eyes. “Yeah, I’m here. You okay? What’s wrong?”

Silence greeted me, a strange mix of static, trembling breaths, and what sounded like sniffles as she tried to hold back tears. “Please . . . help me.”

“Cindy?” Concern building in my mind, I switched on a nearby lamp and pulled myself from the couch with a grunt at the tightness in my lower back. “You there? What’s going on?”

More shaky gasps followed, and just over the static, I thought I heard the faint sound of melodic humming in the background.

“Something’s wrong.” Cindy whispered, her words so quiet that they made each breath sound like cannon fire. “T-The woods are . . . something fell out of the sky and . . . it was so loud, it woke me up. There’s a fire.”

Brow furrowed, I moved fast for the kitchen, stumbling through the dark interior of my little cabin to grope for the light switch. “Stay calm, just stay calm and talk to me. You said there’s a fire? How far away? Can you get to your car?”

Another sniffle came through, clogged with harsh interference as the signal weakened, a sound that made my veins throb with tension. “I-I can’t. Something’s here, it’s in the house, it’s *in the house with me*. W-We can’t get out.”

My throat tried to close up, and I gulped hard against a wave of nausea. “Someone broke in? Are you hurt? Where’s Erin?”

A long pause, and in the background of the mute static, I could have sworn the humming sound cut out, as though whoever it was stopped their eerie melody all at once.

“She’s gone.” Something in Cindy’s tone changed, as if the fear drained away to a blank emotionless rasp, and the line went dead with a chilling *click.*

Every inch of my body racked with a shiver, and both feet seemed glued to the floor in a strange form of dread.

Like so many girls before them, Cindy Fadro and Erin Martinelli had been hired on to be caretakers and actors in the Wickenshire Living History Estate. Erin was 19, studying to be a nurse, while Cindy had just graduated high school and wanted to be a teacher. They were good kids, calm, intelligent, and great workers. Though I never had any children, they were like daughters of my own, and they even baked a cake for my birthday in June. Once they called me in for a leaky pipe, but only after they had done their best to fix it themselves with a tool kit I’d left in the stairwell cupboard. Smart little troopers that they were, the girls even had the common sense to shut the correct valve off and found the leak on their own. Had it been anyone else, I might have considered this to be a prank, a joke, some dumb idea made by bored kids to get a new video for their social media nonsense, but I knew Cindy and Erin.

They didn’t pull pranks like this.

Unnerved, I tried to redial her number but got no answer. Erin’s number yielded the same result, and I shook my head at myself.

*Screw it, I’m not taking any chances.*

I was midway through yanking my work boots on when the sheriff picked up.

*“Hello?”*

From the gruffness in his words, I could tell he’d been asleep as well, but I couldn’t waste time with the standard 911 procedures.

“David, it’s me.” I cinched down the laces on my boots and grabbed my Carhart jacket from its hook by the door. “Cindy just called from the Wickenshire place. There’s a fire on the mountain, and I think someone’s broken into the house. I’m headed there now.”

Rustling on the opposite end of the phone let me know David was up, likely going through the same motions as myself. The son of a Polish man and a Kootenai woman, David Kowolski and I had known each other since high school, and even played football on the same team. Nicknamed ‘White Cloud’ for his European features and Native American blood, he was stubborn with a quick temper, but tenacious when it came to his job. As a law man he drove his deputies relentlessly, backed them to the hilt when it came to any court battles, and as a result he’d managed to keep the crime in Jacob’s Fork quite low over the years. We didn’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I knew I could count on him when it came to something like this. If Cindy or Erin were in danger, Sheriff Kowolski would ride through hell and back to get them out, which was exactly the kind of man I needed right now.

*“I’ll get on the horn to a few of my boys and have them meet you there.”* He replied, and I heard the zipping of a coat on his end, along with the metallic *cha-click* of a handgun slide being racked. *“Fire teams are going to need time to get spun up, so whatever happens, don’t go wandering off without letting me know. Last thing I want is us getting caught in the flames if they decide to move down the mountain.”*

I nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see me and kept the phone pressed to my ear as I swiped my truck keys from the porcelain ashtray near the front door. “Got it.”

*“Be careful, Andy.”* His voice hitched in a low pause, as if the sheriff himself had as bad a feeling about this as I did, and he hung up.

Rain pattered on the windshield of my ancient pickup truck as I wound my way through the dark backroads of northern Idaho, the night sky black with the clouds of late fall. On the sun-faded seat next to me lay my work kit; a simple heavy duty canvas tool bag that held various tools, keys, a flashlight, and an old revolver handed down to me from my grandfather. I used the tools in my job every day as the groundskeeper, janitor, and fix-it-all handyman for the Wickenshire House, which had been part of our small town for as long as anyone could remember. Set on a picturesque 103 acres of fields and woodland in the shadow of the nearby Smoke Point Mountain, the Wickenshire House was a rare example of eastern architecture in the far reaches of the American West. It was the property of our town’s oldest resident, Mr. Edward J. Watkins, a kindly if forgetful soul who’d seen 91 years on this earth and still could drive his own car, though he had a little trouble with stairs. He lived in a cottage on the western edge of town, but I wasn’t about to call him at this time of night, even for something so urgent. Knowing Ed Watkins, he would try to drive out to the house with his slippers on and get hurt stumbling around in the flames.

*Or run into whatever scumbag is in the house, God forbid.*

On the horizon, some of the clouds began to glow, an orange flicker that widened on the mountainside as the distant fire spread. I could barely glimpse an odd plume of smoke in the sky, not curved upward from the fire but downward in a long arc, backlit by the flames. Looking at it, I had a momentary lapse of courage, my resolve wavering. Cindy had said something ‘fell from the sky’. This looked like a trail of some kind, maybe a crashed plane or a fallen weather balloon. If there was jet fuel on the ground, the fire would be even worse to put out than usual. It was horrible, rotten luck all the way around; a wildfire on the same night the house had its first break in, while the girls were there alone.

Adrenaline pumping, I sped up the lonely gravel trail to the house, one of the final sections of public roadways that got this close to the mountain. The Wickenshire House reared from the gloom ahead, its tall gates and Victorian gables illuminated by the dual halos of my truck’s headlights. It still took my breath away, the ornate beauty of the place, built as if every stone had been placed by a perfectionist’s hand. It stood at two stories in height, built from stone mined at the local quarry, with multiple chimneys, a balcony overlooking the back garden, and a grand front porch that wrapped halfway around the entire structure. A stone wall encircled the main grounds, with a wrought iron gate at the drive and several ornamental gardens interspersed throughout. Plush lawns stretched in between, and there were a few oak trees planted there for their brilliant colors in the fall. A small garage had been built around the back of the house sometime in the 1960’s, but this mainly held the riding lawnmower and a small shop where I did most of my repair work. Cindy and Erins’ cars were parked back there, the front gravel lot reserved for visitors during the daily tours. I didn’t see any other vehicle that the intruder might have used, but something else caught my attention in that moment, and held it with a pull like gravity.

*Lord have mercy.*

I stared, slack jawed, at a huge sea of flames that roared through the nearby trees with a voracious appetite. The fire hadn’t wasted any time, chewing through the wet growth as if the rain had never fell, evergreens crackling as they burned to dust in minutes. The heat came through my windshield in a steady increase, warm enough that I couldn’t tell the difference between the fire and my truck heater. The open grassy slopes around the house were consumed as the flames inched closer to the building, and fire closed in from both east and west.

Bounding from my truck, I dashed up to the front door and pulled the handles.

The polished brass knobs rattled but didn’t turn, the flames licking their way across the prairie grass outside the ornate courtyard walls.

*Locked. That means our scumbag didn’t break in through here. Maybe he went around the back?*

With shaking hands, I put down the canvas tool bag and dug in it for my key ring.

Sirens began to wail in the distance, and I finally managed to force the doors open, leaving the keys in the lock to snatch my aged pistol.

“Cindy!” I produced a flashlight with my left hand to hold it beneath my gun, and swept the beam of it over the murky interior. “Erin! Where are you?”

I’d been in the house countless times over the years, but in that moment it felt suffocating, like a great stony maw waiting for me to go far enough in so as to swallow me whole. The foyer led to a large room with a grand staircase, doorways on either side opening to the main dining room and a sitting room respectively. Signs and velvet ropes were posted to guide visitors through the proper areas, a gift shop in the rear of the house near the old parlor, along with guest bathrooms added on to the original back porch. With all the lights off, it looked alien, surreal for this part of the country with its eastern Victorian mystique, and my skin prickled at the sensation that there were eyes in every shadow. Of course, I had been stupid to yell. I’d let my panic get the better of me, and now I had given away the element of surprise. If some creep was in the house somewhere with Erin or Cindy, doing God-knows-what, I wouldn’t be able to sneak up on him now.

*Alright then, might as well move fast.*

With the old revolver grasped in my trembling hands, I headed for the stairs and took them three at a time. The wood creaked under my steps, ancient chestnut and oak that had been sawn before the Great Depression, each footfall like a cannon in the silent house. From here, the roar of the fire outside seemed a muffled whisper, as though there were two different realities, and the house stood guard between them. However, I remembered the heat coming through the windshield of my pickup and knew I didn’t have much time. Soon the house would be in flames, the fire outside enough to melt glass and ignite the wooden siding in minutes.

I reached the top of the stairs and swept my flashlight beam down both ends of the corridor at the top, uncertain of which direction to go first. Cindy and Erin were roomed down the hall to the left, but if someone had indeed broken into the house, Cindy might have hid somewhere else. Every second wasted could mean life or death, and I realized that either way, I’d be turning my back to the unknown.

Something flickered in the beam of my light, a brief whisp of shadow that jerked back behind the far corner of the right-side hallway. I didn’t have more than a moment to see clear details, but there was enough of an image burned into my mind that it came to me in a cold rush.

A face.

*Kowolski, you’d better get here soon.*

Swallowing, I paced down the hallway, my handgun leveled on the spot where the shadow had been.

Upon reaching it, I inched in a wide arc around the corner, bracing for a figure to jump out at me.

The air caught in my throat, and I stared at a section of wallpaper bathed in the aura of my flashlight.

Brownish-black sludge had been daubed on the wall, smeared into a perfect circle so that the excess dripped over the wallpaper like ebony tears. I couldn’t tell if it was mud, blood, or something else, but the corridor stank of rot and the putrid scent of stagnant water. Thorny bits of twig had been woven together, tied here and there with bits of plant fiber to form a circle that overlaid the sludge. Pasted together on the wall, these seemed to make up a protective ring, and in the middle were the handprints.

From what I could see, they were two different sizes, slender fingers and narrow palms indicating two younger females. Both prints faced downwards, slightly overlapping each other at the heel of the palm, and the thumbs arced toward one another like pincers. Unlike the grimy sludge, these were pressed to the old wallpaper in an unmistakable red hue, and it hit me what I was looking at.

*A spider.*

The four fingers of each hand made the legs, the thumbs its mandibles. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the blackness of the outer paste came from petals . . . rose petals to be exact. There were no roses growing in Idaho this time of year, and I’d never seen a natural black rose in my life, yet these appeared fresh. Most had been ground to a powder that gave the foul substance its dark color, others pushed into the muck like decorative flair, giving a strange, heady undertone to the mixture. With this discovery came more clarity; the thorny twigs glued into the circle were not random. They spread inward toward the spider, forming a sharp web of spikes that enshrined it, with the careful touch of an artisan. Such a display would have taken hours to make, certainly longer than the time it took for Cindy to call me. How was this possible?

*“Mr. Todd!”*

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the horrific cry echoing from somewhere behind me, Cindy’s voice tinged in pain and fear.

No sooner had I turned, running a short distance back toward the main corridor at the top of the stairs, and the voice cut out with a high, agonized scream.

“Cindy!” I charged toward the girls’ rooms, heart pounding in my chest.

*“Help me!”* Back in the direction of the symbol, Erin’s voice rang out, choked with sobs and full of torment. *“Mr. Todd, please!”*

Acidic bewilderment slithered through my mind, and I skidded to a stop, caught in the middle of the hallway, the staircase just to my left. I had been so close, perhaps a door away from Erin only moments ago. Could there be more than one intruder holding the girls in separate rooms?

*Cindy is closest. I have to get to her. She sounds like she’s hurt.*

Teeth gritted against the screams of Erin, I forced myself through the left side hallway, her voice ringing in my ears as she begged for my help.

At the end of the hall, I reached the rooms given to the girls and lunged for the handle to Cindy’s.

It didn’t turn, locked from the inside.

Backing up, I drove the heel of my boot into the door next to the lock and heard the old wood splinter. Any other time, I would have balked at such destruction, these doors being over 80 years old, but it didn’t matter anymore. What the fire didn’t get would not be worth Cindy or Erin’s lives.

The door swung open to slap against the bedroom wall, and I dashed inside, revolver in hand.

*What the . . .*

Within the quiet interior of the bedroom, everything looked untouched, the curtains partially open, the bed rumpled from where Cindy had gotten up to check the window, a discarded work uniform in the clothes hamper by the door. Dark stained wood trim lined the walls, windows, and doorway, the walls papered with a robin egg blue pattern that gave it an airy feeling. The white lacy curtains wafted like clouds in the slight draft that came in the open hallway door, and the vintage hot water heater gurgled in the corner as steam worked its way through the pipes. There were modern touches as well, more lamps and lights plugged into the discreet electrical outlets in the walls, a small television on its stand across from the bed, and a side door opened to a shared bathroom between Cindy’s room and Erin’s. This room wasn’t open to tourists, as it was the private living quarters for our workers, so such things were permissible here, as opposed to other parts of the house. Nothing seemed out of place, but there was no sign of Cindy anywhere, no clues to indicate that she’d been there moments ago. It was as if she’d gotten out of bed, looked out the window, and vanished into thin air.

In a flurry of movement, I checked under the bed, in the closet, and the bathroom. When those came back clean, I broke through the bathroom door into Erin’s room, only to find more of the same.

There was no sign of the girls anywhere.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* Erin’s screams continued from the opposite end of the long corridor, and I flung open the bedroom door to retrace my mad dash in her direction, confusion and frustration mounting.

Rounding the corner that bore the strange mark on the wall, I swayed to a stop on the old floorboards next to the door where her screams had come from and yanked on the knob.

*You’ve got to be kidding me . . . how many doors did they lock before I got here?*

With a gasp of exertion, I backed up to kick the door in like the last one, muscles tensed for the effort.

*“Mr. Todd!”* Cindy’s cries exploded from the doorway behind me, rabid and intense as the door rattles on its hinges like she was throwing herself against it from within the room.

I froze, staring at the door, heart racing as my mind whirled. How could she be in there? I’d heard Cindy on the other side of the house not five minutes ago. There was no way she could have moved that fast, not without going past me. I would have seen her in the hall, would have heard the ancient doors creaking on their hinges as they opened.

She couldn’t be in there.

*“Please, help me!”* Erin’s screams started up again, but this time from somewhere in the left-side hallway, and another door began to groan in muted *thuds* as if she too were trying to break it down.

A dry fear crept into my throat, different than what I’d known coming into the house. This didn’t make sense. Erin’s voice had been coming from the door I stood ready to break into, but now it was to my left. Cindy’s had been coming from her room in the west wing but now called from the door behind me. Neither could have left their respective rooms without entering the hall, and I knew for a fact that there weren’t any old-fashioned servant entrances anywhere that could have let them move unnoticed. Something was wrong, very wrong.

Shaken, I took a step away from the door that echoed with Cindy’s voice. “Cindy?”

*“Mr. Todd!”* She begged from the other side of the oak planking, the wood slamming against the jam with wild urgency. *“Please, help me! Please!”*

“The door is locked.” I tried not to hyperventilate as I watched the knob rattle in its socket, knowing fully well the lock was on her side of the door. “Can you let me in?”

Her wails increased in pitch, the screeches an awful combination of agony and terror that made my stomach churn. It sounded as if Cindy was being tormented in the worst ways imaginable, but something about the cadence of each shriek felt off, enough that my brain sent up warning alarms inside my skull.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* She pleaded once more, the same words both girls kept using in various rearrangements over and over, the door shuddering under each blow she made.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I sucked in a breath, eyes focused on the doorknob as it clacked back-and-forth, like Cindy wanted to open it but couldn’t. An uncanny thought rose in my mind, bone-chilling in its clarity, growing louder and louder so that it burst from me before I could stop it.

“Cindy,” I gripped my flashlight so hard that my knuckles turned white. “What’s my first name?”

Like a thunderclap, Cindy’s pleas ceased, along with Erin’s, so that the entire house fell into dead silence. Nothing moved, and even the muffled roar of the wildfire outside seemed deadened further than before, as though the house was a vacuum of sound. My skin crawled, the air thick in my lungs, and a strange certainty took hold of me that made the sense of dread even worse as Cindy’s words about Erin trickled through my brain.

*She’s gone.*

*Click.*

To my right, a doorknob at the far end of the hallway unlocked.

*Click.*

Another lock slid open, this one closer, the doors remaining shut as more joined them one-by-one.

*Click.*

*Click.*

*Click.*

A twinge of panic tightened in my throat, but I leveled the beam of my flashlight at the first door that had unlocked, blood surging in my temples. Everything seemed loud, the heartbeat in my chest, the breath in my lungs, the groan of the floorboards under my boots. My vision narrowed, a vibration hummed to life inside my skull, and I tasted metal on my tongue. In my hand, the flashlight began to flicker as if the batteries were struggling to remain lit, and I couldn’t lift the revolver, my arms refusing to move like the gun weighed as much as a car.

The locks carried on past me, every door on the second story unlocking itself in a continuous march, until at last, the final *click* resounded from the far hallway like cannon fire to my ears.

For a moment, the silence returned, so thick it may as well have been water.

*Wham.*

Every door on the second story flung open, impacting against the wall inside their respective rooms so hard that I heard plaster *crunch*, the hinges squealing on old dust.

With them came the screams.

There were hundreds of voices, some human, others less so, bellowing at the top of their lungs to be heard over one another. If they were saying any words, they were lost among the throng, a constant roar of vocals that soured in my ears for the sheer volume of it. Somewhere among the morass, I could barely catch the sound of Erin and Cindy’s voices shrieking with the others, a morbid choir of pain, suffering, and fear. It seemed to seep out of the floorboards, ooze from the heater vents, and rebound off the walls in every direction. With the doors open, the deep orange glow of the flames outside poured into the house like a tidal wave, but oddly enough no heat came with it, the hallway as cold as if I’d stepped into a freezer. The shadows elongated in the firelight, swaying as they inched up the papered walls, and a pungent smell followed them.

Roses.

It came with overpowering strength, sickly-sweet, but unmistakable. As the tide of shadows advanced down the hall toward me, the fermented stink of roses filled the air like poison gas, and I tasted copper on my lips.

*I have to get out of here.*

Coughing on the blood running from both nostrils, I stumbled toward the stairs, my head a mess of static. Like a tide of slithering vines, the inky shadows pursued me with ravenous hunger. I could feel their magnetic pull, the chorus of screams still ringing across the house with deafening volume, a terrible siren song that tugged at something deep within my subconscious. Voices, so many voices, begged me to stay, to go back, to find the darkest room and sink myself into the abyss until it drowned me.

Something tightened on my ankle just as I reached the top of the staircase, and I toppled headlong down the steps.

*Bam.*

My hip rammed into a banister, and I lost my grip on the pistol.

*Wham.*

Another step hit my shoulder, and I felt my teeth bite into my tongue, the flashlight clattering away into the floor below.

*Smack.*

My head connected with the floorboards at the landing, and the blackness threatened to close over my eyes for the last time.

*Creak.*

One of the steps flexed under the weight of a foot, and I gulped air in pain to squint at the shadows.

*Creak.*

Another footstep echoed toward me, something at the top of the steps descending with a slow, methodical gait. It didn’t sound heavy, not the deft pace of a large man or thick boot, but almost delicate, light, graceful. Yet, there was something about each carefully placed step, each sigh and squeak of the aged woodwork that made my skin wriggle. Something was coming, something that knew exactly where I was even in the pitch blackness of the house.

It was watching me, *stalking* me through the shadows like a cat with a mouse.

Desperate fear surged in my brain, and I clawed through the dark on my stomach to find a way out. I last remembered the front door being nearby, but it seemed to take an eternity to move across the cold floorboards, the unseen presence mere yards behind me as I wriggled forward.

At last, I managed to gain my footing, though it hurt to put weight on my right leg, and hurled myself forward in the blind shadows.

*Thud.*

Both front doors flew open, and I tumbled out onto the porch, rolling down the steps into the stones of the walkway.

Like a switch had been thrown, the world seemed to come alive once more, the cold sensation fading, the sound returning. Sirens wailed closer as headlights appeared in the long gravel driveway, and the crackle of flames roared from the trees. Smoke filled my nostrils, heat from the nearby fire licked over my skin, and I rolled onto my side to look back toward the house.

My lungs tightened, and I stared, unable to pull my eyes away.

Inside the open front doorway, nothing was visible, not the glint of firelight from inside, nor the faint glow of it coming through any ground windows. The entrance was a mass of impenetrable shadows that seemed to form a solid wall at the threshold, yet deep within that abyss, something stared back.

It had no shape, no form that I could identify it with, but there was definitely a presence that stood just beyond the light, watching me from the gloom. My eyes seemed fastened to it, either by my own primordial fear, or perhaps willed so by whatever peered out of the wretched expanse. A torrent of emotions ripped through my mind, warped and misshapen, like cold fingers pried at the taps of my humanity to unleash a maelstrom of feeling. Hunger and fear. Hate and despair. Lust and sadness. Grief and pain. They all rolled over one another, tumbling in and out of each other in a never-ending tide, and it hit me with a strangled form of clarity that these weren’t *my* emotions.

Locked in place by the unknown being’s gaze, I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as cry out, my only option to fight back with what little expression I had left.

*What are you?*

Something about my terrified thought seemed to strike a chord within the cascade of terrible shadow, for the next instant the doors on the house creaked in their wrought-iron hinges, and then swung shut on their own.

The rest of the night was a blur, a stupor, one that I wandered through in a mindless fog. Firefighting crews appeared from miles around to help put out the blaze, but not before it chewed through all 103 acres on the Wickenshire estate. Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was burned to cinders. Even boulders cracked from the intense heat, the smoke pall so large it could be seen from Montana, or so I heard. One of the fire trucks exploded when its fuel tank caught fire and killed three men. Everything burned . . . except the house.

For some reason, the fire stopped at the stone courtyard walls and went no further. In a blaze hot enough that it had turned some minor sandpits on the mountain to crude glass, there wasn’t so much as a scorch mark on the house or its outbuildings. None of the paint peeled, the siding wasn’t so much as warm to the touch, and all the plants withing the yard were unscathed. The investigators couldn’t even find ash on the roof from the fire afterwards, not a single flake. Unlike its ruined acreage, the Wickenshire House had survived the wildfire unharmed, and no one could make any sense of it.

Once the fire was finally put out, they took me to the local clinic for my injuries, a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and a concussion from my tumble down the stairs. Sheriff Kowolski visited in the morning to see how I was, and to fill me in on what I’d missed once they trucked me away from the site.

Over three hundred search and rescue volunteers had been called out, along with special forensics teams from neighboring counties, and they hadn’t found any sign of Cindy Fadro or Erin Martinelli. The last time they managed to ping Cindy’s phone via satellite, it had registered a mile up the slope from the house, but they never managed to recover the device. Tracking dogs refused to go near the house and seemed to lose all scent once they left the property boundaries. No trace of Erin was discovered, and no DNA could be found in either of the girls’ rooms to point to a culprit. One of the searchers claimed he had heard what sounded like a female voice screaming for help on the northern slope, but he wasn’t sure where it had come from, and no one else could verify it. Another man claimed he saw someone walking inside the tree line near the eastern edge of the property but never got a good glimpse at their face to see who they were. With all speculation bereft of evidence, it seemed to everyone that both Cindy and Erin had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Worse yet, when I described my account to the sheriff, he informed me that his team hadn’t found any symbols painted on the walls, nor did they see anything out of the ordinary. All they found that aligned with my story was the strange, overwhelming aroma of roses that permeated the house.

Nothing more.

That was six weeks ago. I got out of the clinic within a few days after the event, but the continued search efforts proved fruitless. With their investigation coming up cold, the sheriff’s office released the house back to Mr. Watkins, who closed it indefinitely. I had never seen him so distraught in my life, as Ed took the girls’ disappearance rather hard. He felt personally responsible, though we all knew there wasn’t anything he could have done, especially since no one knew what happened to Erin or Cindy. However, Ed apparently decided to go there himself late one evening to do some looking around the house and didn’t bother to tell anyone else. It wasn’t until his cleaning lady stopped by his cottage in Jacob’s Fork the next morning that Ed was reported missing, and police dispatched to the Wickenshire House.

They never found him.

His car was parked out front, the doors unlocked, but they couldn’t find a trace of Edward Watkins anywhere on the property. I helped with the search, as I basically slept in the sheriff’s office these days, and found no sign of a struggle or any other foul play, only the smell of roses. We dug deep this time, rifled through local records, archives, property history, everything we could get our hands on about the estate. There was nothing to indicate this place would be trouble, no forgotten building plans with hidden rooms, no land disputes with older tenants, no tribal issues from burial grounds or holy sites. The property was normal, and even when I poked around to see if there had been any deaths, suicides, or other sordid affairs associated with the house, my search came up blank. There was no reason for this to be happen, not from human effort, or anything else.

Even now, as December drags on, nothing has been the same. No plants grow in the burned zone, not even the smallest patch of liken or moss, as if the ground is poisoned to its core. Animals avoid it, so that the uncharred sections of forest around the property are empty, silent places. The access road is chained off to keep curious locals away, and Sheriff Kowolski let me bunk at a small ranger cabin at the base of the mountain just so I could keep tabs on the place. I think he knew I needed to be close, to keep an eye on the house, and keep looking for answers. I can’t explain why, but I know something is in there, waiting, biding its time. It failed to get me that night, but I have a terrible premonition that it doesn’t need *me*.

It just needs *more*.

I’ve found markers in the last few days. Piles of bones. Not haphazard from an animal kill, but stacked, organized, purposeful. Bits of twine made from plant fibers hold them together, and despite being in the open, no animals will bother them, not even the vultures. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, they think I can’t process the girls being gone, but I’ve stumbled on over a dozen of them now. They seemed to be set in a wide ring around the property line, spanning outward from the house into the forest beyond, capturing more territory by the day. No matter how many times I remove them, the piles always reappear, with fresh bones added to the stacks. I don’t touch them anymore, and I don’t even make eye contact with the empty eye sockets of the skulls. The few times I have, I heard whispers in my sleep, and had nightmares of eyes in the shadows of my room.

Some of the bones are like those of a rabbit or mole, while others are bigger like elk or bear. Every pile is topped with a skull, most of them from small game, but five of the piles hold unique skulls; a bear, a coyote, an eagle, a snake, and lastly, a great bull elk. They are laid out opposite one another ringing the house, the rest of the smaller markers ranging from them into the forest beyond. Of all the markers, the one with the elk skull is tallest, its full spread of antlers still intact so that it is nine feet high at the eye sockets. I found a symbol painted onto the bone forehead with powdered charcoal that the rain never seems to wash away, no matter how many times I go up to it.

A spider.

One made of two slender, inverted hands, both the same size.

I’m posting this so that it’s on record, in case one of these days I don’t come back from that mountain. Service was always spotty up there before, but ever since that night, it’s been non-existent. Even the few trail cameras I’ve put out have either gone dead or produced nothing but blurry photos. Something is building these markers, watching me whenever I walk the perimeter, and shifting in the corners of my vision whenever I turn my head. I’ve discovered trail signs that have been purposefully moved to misdirect me. Sometimes I hear screams in the woods, distant and warped, but they sound like Erin’s cries. I see flashes of blonde hair in the bushes that I want to believe is Cindy, but I know it can’t be.

They’re gone, both of them.

Only the sheriff understands, even if he doesn’t say much to that effect. I can see it in his eyes, he knows that I’m telling the truth, and his own deputies have been up to the house to see the piles multiple times. There’s nothing they can do, nothing but wait from the valley below and hope that the snow buries whatever it is for the winter.

There’s something wrong with the Wickenshire House, something *inside* it, something unseen that walks the grounds day and night. It wants more than the estate, I can feel it, can taste it in the wind, hear it in the dry crunch of snow under my boots, and feel it in the shivers I get every time I look at the dark, barren windows of that cursed structure.

It wants the forest, the trees, the mountain.

For a little background we started the day with taking her car to the mechanic to get a new battery because her’s was dead. I followed in my car and after dropping off the car I suggested we go to Target and kill time until it was ready later in the day. Target is one of her favorite stores and she loves to just walk around and look at everything in it, even when not buying anything. We get to Target and walk around for about 5 minutes and shes looking at some clothes, then I say I need new winter gloves and some long socks so I head to the men’s section. While I’m looking over there she tells me she’s getting cranky and I ask what she wants to do. She said she didn’t know so I suggested she go to the Starbucks in the Target and grab a coffee as a treat. She happily does and I go about grabbing what I need. I then go and grab some snacks she likes and a candle I know she loves then head over to the Starbucks to get her. When I got over there she wasn’t there, and my hands were full since I hadn’t gotten a cart. I decided to just buy the stuff so I could bag it and then find her. After I did that I double checked the Starbucks to make sure she wasn’t in a corner I didn’t see sitting down, she was not. As if she read my mind she called me right before I was going to call her. She asked where I was because she went to the men’s section and I was not there, I said I was at the Starbucks looking for her. We met in the middle, but upon seeing the bags in my hands she began freaking out and yelling at me in the store because I had checked out already. Confused, I asked why it mattered that I had bought some things and said we could still walk around and peruse like she likes to do. She insisted that me checking out already was ruining the trip to the store for her and that we had to go now. I made it clear I checked out just to free up my hands and that I had no issue staying and killing time walking around there. Nevertheless she continued getting angry saying I ruined it and that we could not stay. The argument continued to the car, the whole time I insisted I only checked out to free my hands and that I wanted to stay and keep looking around. This argument continued for hours, including her refusing to get back in my car after we went to another store, and her telling me to take her to her parents, which I did, but then upon getting there she was mad I was going to leave her there.

There’s a new guy at work. He’s been there for about two weeks, but we’ve barely crossed paths because our shifts never line up. Today, unfortunately, fate decided to correct that mistake.

Our boss paired us up and asked me to show him the ropes. I asked him to repeat his name, and he did, but I barely registered it, because at that exact moment his breath hit me like a biological weapon. Whatever he said was instantly erased from my brain by the stench pouring out of his mouth.

We then spent six full hours working side by side. Six Hours!!! Even when he wasn’t talking, the smell lingered, like it had filed a formal complaint and decided to stay. At one point, out of pure desperation, I asked if he wanted some tea, coffee, water, fucking anything!!! We even have fresh fruits and vegetables. Salvation was within reach.

1pnjfqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cant_sleep/comments/1pnjfqq/theres_something_wrong_with_the_wickenshire_house/,There's something wrong with the Wickenshire House.,"The blaring of my cellphone jolted me awake, and I sat up with a groan.

*Getting too old for this.*

In front of my ragged couch, the TV continued with its black and white parade of old footage from a World War One documentary, though the war seemed nearly over now. Judging by the digital clock on the mantelpiece, which read 3:49 AM, I’d been asleep for at least five hours. My body ached, a familiar problem at my age, but enough that I chided myself for not going to bed earlier like a responsible person. It had been a long day, so I came home to a cold shower, a few hot dogs warmed in the microwave and settled down to watch some television before bed. Of course, at 55 years old I’d misjudged how tired I really was and spent close to half the night slumped on my sofa, which meant I would be paying for it in the morning with stiff joints and a sore back.

Palming my cracked Motorola from the coffee table, I found the TV remote and hit the *mute* button as I answered the call. “Hello?”

Shaky breathing grated on the other end, and after a few moments, a girl’s hushed voice whispered through. “Mr. Todd?”

Ice rippled through my veins at the sound of Cindy’s panicked voice, and I sat up straighter to rub at my bleary eyes. “Yeah, I’m here. You okay? What’s wrong?”

Silence greeted me, a strange mix of static, trembling breaths, and what sounded like sniffles as she tried to hold back tears. “Please . . . help me.”

“Cindy?” Concern building in my mind, I switched on a nearby lamp and pulled myself from the couch with a grunt at the tightness in my lower back. “You there? What’s going on?”

More shaky gasps followed, and just over the static, I thought I heard the faint sound of melodic humming in the background.

“Something’s wrong.” Cindy whispered, her words so quiet that they made each breath sound like cannon fire. “T-The woods are . . . something fell out of the sky and . . . it was so loud, it woke me up. There’s a fire.”

Brow furrowed, I moved fast for the kitchen, stumbling through the dark interior of my little cabin to grope for the light switch. “Stay calm, just stay calm and talk to me. You said there’s a fire? How far away? Can you get to your car?”

Another sniffle came through, clogged with harsh interference as the signal weakened, a sound that made my veins throb with tension. “I-I can’t. Something’s here, it’s in the house, it’s *in the house with me*. W-We can’t get out.”

My throat tried to close up, and I gulped hard against a wave of nausea. “Someone broke in? Are you hurt? Where’s Erin?”

A long pause, and in the background of the mute static, I could have sworn the humming sound cut out, as though whoever it was stopped their eerie melody all at once.

“She’s gone.” Something in Cindy’s tone changed, as if the fear drained away to a blank emotionless rasp, and the line went dead with a chilling *click.*

Every inch of my body racked with a shiver, and both feet seemed glued to the floor in a strange form of dread.

Like so many girls before them, Cindy Fadro and Erin Martinelli had been hired on to be caretakers and actors in the Wickenshire Living History Estate. Erin was 19, studying to be a nurse, while Cindy had just graduated high school and wanted to be a teacher. They were good kids, calm, intelligent, and great workers. Though I never had any children, they were like daughters of my own, and they even baked a cake for my birthday in June. Once they called me in for a leaky pipe, but only after they had done their best to fix it themselves with a tool kit I’d left in the stairwell cupboard. Smart little troopers that they were, the girls even had the common sense to shut the correct valve off and found the leak on their own. Had it been anyone else, I might have considered this to be a prank, a joke, some dumb idea made by bored kids to get a new video for their social media nonsense, but I knew Cindy and Erin.

They didn’t pull pranks like this.

Unnerved, I tried to redial her number but got no answer. Erin’s number yielded the same result, and I shook my head at myself.

*Screw it, I’m not taking any chances.*

I was midway through yanking my work boots on when the sheriff picked up.

*“Hello?”*

From the gruffness in his words, I could tell he’d been asleep as well, but I couldn’t waste time with the standard 911 procedures.

“David, it’s me.” I cinched down the laces on my boots and grabbed my Carhart jacket from its hook by the door. “Cindy just called from the Wickenshire place. There’s a fire on the mountain, and I think someone’s broken into the house. I’m headed there now.”

Rustling on the opposite end of the phone let me know David was up, likely going through the same motions as myself. The son of a Polish man and a Kootenai woman, David Kowolski and I had known each other since high school, and even played football on the same team. Nicknamed ‘White Cloud’ for his European features and Native American blood, he was stubborn with a quick temper, but tenacious when it came to his job. As a law man he drove his deputies relentlessly, backed them to the hilt when it came to any court battles, and as a result he’d managed to keep the crime in Jacob’s Fork quite low over the years. We didn’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I knew I could count on him when it came to something like this. If Cindy or Erin were in danger, Sheriff Kowolski would ride through hell and back to get them out, which was exactly the kind of man I needed right now.

*“I’ll get on the horn to a few of my boys and have them meet you there.”* He replied, and I heard the zipping of a coat on his end, along with the metallic *cha-click* of a handgun slide being racked. *“Fire teams are going to need time to get spun up, so whatever happens, don’t go wandering off without letting me know. Last thing I want is us getting caught in the flames if they decide to move down the mountain.”*

I nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see me and kept the phone pressed to my ear as I swiped my truck keys from the porcelain ashtray near the front door. “Got it.”

*“Be careful, Andy.”* His voice hitched in a low pause, as if the sheriff himself had as bad a feeling about this as I did, and he hung up.

Rain pattered on the windshield of my ancient pickup truck as I wound my way through the dark backroads of northern Idaho, the night sky black with the clouds of late fall. On the sun-faded seat next to me lay my work kit; a simple heavy duty canvas tool bag that held various tools, keys, a flashlight, and an old revolver handed down to me from my grandfather. I used the tools in my job every day as the groundskeeper, janitor, and fix-it-all handyman for the Wickenshire House, which had been part of our small town for as long as anyone could remember. Set on a picturesque 103 acres of fields and woodland in the shadow of the nearby Smoke Point Mountain, the Wickenshire House was a rare example of eastern architecture in the far reaches of the American West. It was the property of our town’s oldest resident, Mr. Edward J. Watkins, a kindly if forgetful soul who’d seen 91 years on this earth and still could drive his own car, though he had a little trouble with stairs. He lived in a cottage on the western edge of town, but I wasn’t about to call him at this time of night, even for something so urgent. Knowing Ed Watkins, he would try to drive out to the house with his slippers on and get hurt stumbling around in the flames.

*Or run into whatever scumbag is in the house, God forbid.*

On the horizon, some of the clouds began to glow, an orange flicker that widened on the mountainside as the distant fire spread. I could barely glimpse an odd plume of smoke in the sky, not curved upward from the fire but downward in a long arc, backlit by the flames. Looking at it, I had a momentary lapse of courage, my resolve wavering. Cindy had said something ‘fell from the sky’. This looked like a trail of some kind, maybe a crashed plane or a fallen weather balloon. If there was jet fuel on the ground, the fire would be even worse to put out than usual. It was horrible, rotten luck all the way around; a wildfire on the same night the house had its first break in, while the girls were there alone.

Adrenaline pumping, I sped up the lonely gravel trail to the house, one of the final sections of public roadways that got this close to the mountain. The Wickenshire House reared from the gloom ahead, its tall gates and Victorian gables illuminated by the dual halos of my truck’s headlights. It still took my breath away, the ornate beauty of the place, built as if every stone had been placed by a perfectionist’s hand. It stood at two stories in height, built from stone mined at the local quarry, with multiple chimneys, a balcony overlooking the back garden, and a grand front porch that wrapped halfway around the entire structure. A stone wall encircled the main grounds, with a wrought iron gate at the drive and several ornamental gardens interspersed throughout. Plush lawns stretched in between, and there were a few oak trees planted there for their brilliant colors in the fall. A small garage had been built around the back of the house sometime in the 1960’s, but this mainly held the riding lawnmower and a small shop where I did most of my repair work. Cindy and Erins’ cars were parked back there, the front gravel lot reserved for visitors during the daily tours. I didn’t see any other vehicle that the intruder might have used, but something else caught my attention in that moment, and held it with a pull like gravity.

*Lord have mercy.*

I stared, slack jawed, at a huge sea of flames that roared through the nearby trees with a voracious appetite. The fire hadn’t wasted any time, chewing through the wet growth as if the rain had never fell, evergreens crackling as they burned to dust in minutes. The heat came through my windshield in a steady increase, warm enough that I couldn’t tell the difference between the fire and my truck heater. The open grassy slopes around the house were consumed as the flames inched closer to the building, and fire closed in from both east and west.

Bounding from my truck, I dashed up to the front door and pulled the handles.

The polished brass knobs rattled but didn’t turn, the flames licking their way across the prairie grass outside the ornate courtyard walls.

*Locked. That means our scumbag didn’t break in through here. Maybe he went around the back?*

With shaking hands, I put down the canvas tool bag and dug in it for my key ring.

Sirens began to wail in the distance, and I finally managed to force the doors open, leaving the keys in the lock to snatch my aged pistol.

“Cindy!” I produced a flashlight with my left hand to hold it beneath my gun, and swept the beam of it over the murky interior. “Erin! Where are you?”

I’d been in the house countless times over the years, but in that moment it felt suffocating, like a great stony maw waiting for me to go far enough in so as to swallow me whole. The foyer led to a large room with a grand staircase, doorways on either side opening to the main dining room and a sitting room respectively. Signs and velvet ropes were posted to guide visitors through the proper areas, a gift shop in the rear of the house near the old parlor, along with guest bathrooms added on to the original back porch. With all the lights off, it looked alien, surreal for this part of the country with its eastern Victorian mystique, and my skin prickled at the sensation that there were eyes in every shadow. Of course, I had been stupid to yell. I’d let my panic get the better of me, and now I had given away the element of surprise. If some creep was in the house somewhere with Erin or Cindy, doing God-knows-what, I wouldn’t be able to sneak up on him now.

*Alright then, might as well move fast.*

With the old revolver grasped in my trembling hands, I headed for the stairs and took them three at a time. The wood creaked under my steps, ancient chestnut and oak that had been sawn before the Great Depression, each footfall like a cannon in the silent house. From here, the roar of the fire outside seemed a muffled whisper, as though there were two different realities, and the house stood guard between them. However, I remembered the heat coming through the windshield of my pickup and knew I didn’t have much time. Soon the house would be in flames, the fire outside enough to melt glass and ignite the wooden siding in minutes.

I reached the top of the stairs and swept my flashlight beam down both ends of the corridor at the top, uncertain of which direction to go first. Cindy and Erin were roomed down the hall to the left, but if someone had indeed broken into the house, Cindy might have hid somewhere else. Every second wasted could mean life or death, and I realized that either way, I’d be turning my back to the unknown.

Something flickered in the beam of my light, a brief whisp of shadow that jerked back behind the far corner of the right-side hallway. I didn’t have more than a moment to see clear details, but there was enough of an image burned into my mind that it came to me in a cold rush.

A face.

*Kowolski, you’d better get here soon.*

Swallowing, I paced down the hallway, my handgun leveled on the spot where the shadow had been.

Upon reaching it, I inched in a wide arc around the corner, bracing for a figure to jump out at me.

The air caught in my throat, and I stared at a section of wallpaper bathed in the aura of my flashlight.

Brownish-black sludge had been daubed on the wall, smeared into a perfect circle so that the excess dripped over the wallpaper like ebony tears. I couldn’t tell if it was mud, blood, or something else, but the corridor stank of rot and the putrid scent of stagnant water. Thorny bits of twig had been woven together, tied here and there with bits of plant fiber to form a circle that overlaid the sludge. Pasted together on the wall, these seemed to make up a protective ring, and in the middle were the handprints.

From what I could see, they were two different sizes, slender fingers and narrow palms indicating two younger females. Both prints faced downwards, slightly overlapping each other at the heel of the palm, and the thumbs arced toward one another like pincers. Unlike the grimy sludge, these were pressed to the old wallpaper in an unmistakable red hue, and it hit me what I was looking at.

*A spider.*

The four fingers of each hand made the legs, the thumbs its mandibles. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the blackness of the outer paste came from petals . . . rose petals to be exact. There were no roses growing in Idaho this time of year, and I’d never seen a natural black rose in my life, yet these appeared fresh. Most had been ground to a powder that gave the foul substance its dark color, others pushed into the muck like decorative flair, giving a strange, heady undertone to the mixture. With this discovery came more clarity; the thorny twigs glued into the circle were not random. They spread inward toward the spider, forming a sharp web of spikes that enshrined it, with the careful touch of an artisan. Such a display would have taken hours to make, certainly longer than the time it took for Cindy to call me. How was this possible?

*“Mr. Todd!”*

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the horrific cry echoing from somewhere behind me, Cindy’s voice tinged in pain and fear.

No sooner had I turned, running a short distance back toward the main corridor at the top of the stairs, and the voice cut out with a high, agonized scream.

“Cindy!” I charged toward the girls’ rooms, heart pounding in my chest.

*“Help me!”* Back in the direction of the symbol, Erin’s voice rang out, choked with sobs and full of torment. *“Mr. Todd, please!”*

Acidic bewilderment slithered through my mind, and I skidded to a stop, caught in the middle of the hallway, the staircase just to my left. I had been so close, perhaps a door away from Erin only moments ago. Could there be more than one intruder holding the girls in separate rooms?

*Cindy is closest. I have to get to her. She sounds like she’s hurt.*

Teeth gritted against the screams of Erin, I forced myself through the left side hallway, her voice ringing in my ears as she begged for my help.

At the end of the hall, I reached the rooms given to the girls and lunged for the handle to Cindy’s.

It didn’t turn, locked from the inside.

Backing up, I drove the heel of my boot into the door next to the lock and heard the old wood splinter. Any other time, I would have balked at such destruction, these doors being over 80 years old, but it didn’t matter anymore. What the fire didn’t get would not be worth Cindy or Erin’s lives.

The door swung open to slap against the bedroom wall, and I dashed inside, revolver in hand.

*What the . . .*

Within the quiet interior of the bedroom, everything looked untouched, the curtains partially open, the bed rumpled from where Cindy had gotten up to check the window, a discarded work uniform in the clothes hamper by the door. Dark stained wood trim lined the walls, windows, and doorway, the walls papered with a robin egg blue pattern that gave it an airy feeling. The white lacy curtains wafted like clouds in the slight draft that came in the open hallway door, and the vintage hot water heater gurgled in the corner as steam worked its way through the pipes. There were modern touches as well, more lamps and lights plugged into the discreet electrical outlets in the walls, a small television on its stand across from the bed, and a side door opened to a shared bathroom between Cindy’s room and Erin’s. This room wasn’t open to tourists, as it was the private living quarters for our workers, so such things were permissible here, as opposed to other parts of the house. Nothing seemed out of place, but there was no sign of Cindy anywhere, no clues to indicate that she’d been there moments ago. It was as if she’d gotten out of bed, looked out the window, and vanished into thin air.

In a flurry of movement, I checked under the bed, in the closet, and the bathroom. When those came back clean, I broke through the bathroom door into Erin’s room, only to find more of the same.

There was no sign of the girls anywhere.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* Erin’s screams continued from the opposite end of the long corridor, and I flung open the bedroom door to retrace my mad dash in her direction, confusion and frustration mounting.

Rounding the corner that bore the strange mark on the wall, I swayed to a stop on the old floorboards next to the door where her screams had come from and yanked on the knob.

*You’ve got to be kidding me . . . how many doors did they lock before I got here?*

With a gasp of exertion, I backed up to kick the door in like the last one, muscles tensed for the effort.

*“Mr. Todd!”* Cindy’s cries exploded from the doorway behind me, rabid and intense as the door rattles on its hinges like she was throwing herself against it from within the room.

I froze, staring at the door, heart racing as my mind whirled. How could she be in there? I’d heard Cindy on the other side of the house not five minutes ago. There was no way she could have moved that fast, not without going past me. I would have seen her in the hall, would have heard the ancient doors creaking on their hinges as they opened.

She couldn’t be in there.

*“Please, help me!”* Erin’s screams started up again, but this time from somewhere in the left-side hallway, and another door began to groan in muted *thuds* as if she too were trying to break it down.

A dry fear crept into my throat, different than what I’d known coming into the house. This didn’t make sense. Erin’s voice had been coming from the door I stood ready to break into, but now it was to my left. Cindy’s had been coming from her room in the west wing but now called from the door behind me. Neither could have left their respective rooms without entering the hall, and I knew for a fact that there weren’t any old-fashioned servant entrances anywhere that could have let them move unnoticed. Something was wrong, very wrong.

Shaken, I took a step away from the door that echoed with Cindy’s voice. “Cindy?”

*“Mr. Todd!”* She begged from the other side of the oak planking, the wood slamming against the jam with wild urgency. *“Please, help me! Please!”*

“The door is locked.” I tried not to hyperventilate as I watched the knob rattle in its socket, knowing fully well the lock was on her side of the door. “Can you let me in?”

Her wails increased in pitch, the screeches an awful combination of agony and terror that made my stomach churn. It sounded as if Cindy was being tormented in the worst ways imaginable, but something about the cadence of each shriek felt off, enough that my brain sent up warning alarms inside my skull.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* She pleaded once more, the same words both girls kept using in various rearrangements over and over, the door shuddering under each blow she made.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I sucked in a breath, eyes focused on the doorknob as it clacked back-and-forth, like Cindy wanted to open it but couldn’t. An uncanny thought rose in my mind, bone-chilling in its clarity, growing louder and louder so that it burst from me before I could stop it.

“Cindy,” I gripped my flashlight so hard that my knuckles turned white. “What’s my first name?”

Like a thunderclap, Cindy’s pleas ceased, along with Erin’s, so that the entire house fell into dead silence. Nothing moved, and even the muffled roar of the wildfire outside seemed deadened further than before, as though the house was a vacuum of sound. My skin crawled, the air thick in my lungs, and a strange certainty took hold of me that made the sense of dread even worse as Cindy’s words about Erin trickled through my brain.

*She’s gone.*

*Click.*

To my right, a doorknob at the far end of the hallway unlocked.

*Click.*

Another lock slid open, this one closer, the doors remaining shut as more joined them one-by-one.

*Click.*

*Click.*

*Click.*

A twinge of panic tightened in my throat, but I leveled the beam of my flashlight at the first door that had unlocked, blood surging in my temples. Everything seemed loud, the heartbeat in my chest, the breath in my lungs, the groan of the floorboards under my boots. My vision narrowed, a vibration hummed to life inside my skull, and I tasted metal on my tongue. In my hand, the flashlight began to flicker as if the batteries were struggling to remain lit, and I couldn’t lift the revolver, my arms refusing to move like the gun weighed as much as a car.

The locks carried on past me, every door on the second story unlocking itself in a continuous march, until at last, the final *click* resounded from the far hallway like cannon fire to my ears.

For a moment, the silence returned, so thick it may as well have been water.

*Wham.*

Every door on the second story flung open, impacting against the wall inside their respective rooms so hard that I heard plaster *crunch*, the hinges squealing on old dust.

With them came the screams.

There were hundreds of voices, some human, others less so, bellowing at the top of their lungs to be heard over one another. If they were saying any words, they were lost among the throng, a constant roar of vocals that soured in my ears for the sheer volume of it. Somewhere among the morass, I could barely catch the sound of Erin and Cindy’s voices shrieking with the others, a morbid choir of pain, suffering, and fear. It seemed to seep out of the floorboards, ooze from the heater vents, and rebound off the walls in every direction. With the doors open, the deep orange glow of the flames outside poured into the house like a tidal wave, but oddly enough no heat came with it, the hallway as cold as if I’d stepped into a freezer. The shadows elongated in the firelight, swaying as they inched up the papered walls, and a pungent smell followed them.

Roses.

It came with overpowering strength, sickly-sweet, but unmistakable. As the tide of shadows advanced down the hall toward me, the fermented stink of roses filled the air like poison gas, and I tasted copper on my lips.

*I have to get out of here.*

Coughing on the blood running from both nostrils, I stumbled toward the stairs, my head a mess of static. Like a tide of slithering vines, the inky shadows pursued me with ravenous hunger. I could feel their magnetic pull, the chorus of screams still ringing across the house with deafening volume, a terrible siren song that tugged at something deep within my subconscious. Voices, so many voices, begged me to stay, to go back, to find the darkest room and sink myself into the abyss until it drowned me.

Something tightened on my ankle just as I reached the top of the staircase, and I toppled headlong down the steps.

*Bam.*

My hip rammed into a banister, and I lost my grip on the pistol.

*Wham.*

Another step hit my shoulder, and I felt my teeth bite into my tongue, the flashlight clattering away into the floor below.

*Smack.*

My head connected with the floorboards at the landing, and the blackness threatened to close over my eyes for the last time.

*Creak.*

One of the steps flexed under the weight of a foot, and I gulped air in pain to squint at the shadows.

*Creak.*

Another footstep echoed toward me, something at the top of the steps descending with a slow, methodical gait. It didn’t sound heavy, not the deft pace of a large man or thick boot, but almost delicate, light, graceful. Yet, there was something about each carefully placed step, each sigh and squeak of the aged woodwork that made my skin wriggle. Something was coming, something that knew exactly where I was even in the pitch blackness of the house.

It was watching me, *stalking* me through the shadows like a cat with a mouse.

Desperate fear surged in my brain, and I clawed through the dark on my stomach to find a way out. I last remembered the front door being nearby, but it seemed to take an eternity to move across the cold floorboards, the unseen presence mere yards behind me as I wriggled forward.

At last, I managed to gain my footing, though it hurt to put weight on my right leg, and hurled myself forward in the blind shadows.

*Thud.*

Both front doors flew open, and I tumbled out onto the porch, rolling down the steps into the stones of the walkway.

Like a switch had been thrown, the world seemed to come alive once more, the cold sensation fading, the sound returning. Sirens wailed closer as headlights appeared in the long gravel driveway, and the crackle of flames roared from the trees. Smoke filled my nostrils, heat from the nearby fire licked over my skin, and I rolled onto my side to look back toward the house.

My lungs tightened, and I stared, unable to pull my eyes away.

Inside the open front doorway, nothing was visible, not the glint of firelight from inside, nor the faint glow of it coming through any ground windows. The entrance was a mass of impenetrable shadows that seemed to form a solid wall at the threshold, yet deep within that abyss, something stared back.

It had no shape, no form that I could identify it with, but there was definitely a presence that stood just beyond the light, watching me from the gloom. My eyes seemed fastened to it, either by my own primordial fear, or perhaps willed so by whatever peered out of the wretched expanse. A torrent of emotions ripped through my mind, warped and misshapen, like cold fingers pried at the taps of my humanity to unleash a maelstrom of feeling. Hunger and fear. Hate and despair. Lust and sadness. Grief and pain. They all rolled over one another, tumbling in and out of each other in a never-ending tide, and it hit me with a strangled form of clarity that these weren’t *my* emotions.

Locked in place by the unknown being’s gaze, I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as cry out, my only option to fight back with what little expression I had left.

*What are you?*

Something about my terrified thought seemed to strike a chord within the cascade of terrible shadow, for the next instant the doors on the house creaked in their wrought-iron hinges, and then swung shut on their own.

The rest of the night was a blur, a stupor, one that I wandered through in a mindless fog. Firefighting crews appeared from miles around to help put out the blaze, but not before it chewed through all 103 acres on the Wickenshire estate. Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was burned to cinders. Even boulders cracked from the intense heat, the smoke pall so large it could be seen from Montana, or so I heard. One of the fire trucks exploded when its fuel tank caught fire and killed three men. Everything burned . . . except the house.

For some reason, the fire stopped at the stone courtyard walls and went no further. In a blaze hot enough that it had turned some minor sandpits on the mountain to crude glass, there wasn’t so much as a scorch mark on the house or its outbuildings. None of the paint peeled, the siding wasn’t so much as warm to the touch, and all the plants withing the yard were unscathed. The investigators couldn’t even find ash on the roof from the fire afterwards, not a single flake. Unlike its ruined acreage, the Wickenshire House had survived the wildfire unharmed, and no one could make any sense of it.

Once the fire was finally put out, they took me to the local clinic for my injuries, a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and a concussion from my tumble down the stairs. Sheriff Kowolski visited in the morning to see how I was, and to fill me in on what I’d missed once they trucked me away from the site.

Over three hundred search and rescue volunteers had been called out, along with special forensics teams from neighboring counties, and they hadn’t found any sign of Cindy Fadro or Erin Martinelli. The last time they managed to ping Cindy’s phone via satellite, it had registered a mile up the slope from the house, but they never managed to recover the device. Tracking dogs refused to go near the house and seemed to lose all scent once they left the property boundaries. No trace of Erin was discovered, and no DNA could be found in either of the girls’ rooms to point to a culprit. One of the searchers claimed he had heard what sounded like a female voice screaming for help on the northern slope, but he wasn’t sure where it had come from, and no one else could verify it. Another man claimed he saw someone walking inside the tree line near the eastern edge of the property but never got a good glimpse at their face to see who they were. With all speculation bereft of evidence, it seemed to everyone that both Cindy and Erin had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Worse yet, when I described my account to the sheriff, he informed me that his team hadn’t found any symbols painted on the walls, nor did they see anything out of the ordinary. All they found that aligned with my story was the strange, overwhelming aroma of roses that permeated the house.

Nothing more.

That was six weeks ago. I got out of the clinic within a few days after the event, but the continued search efforts proved fruitless. With their investigation coming up cold, the sheriff’s office released the house back to Mr. Watkins, who closed it indefinitely. I had never seen him so distraught in my life, as Ed took the girls’ disappearance rather hard. He felt personally responsible, though we all knew there wasn’t anything he could have done, especially since no one knew what happened to Erin or Cindy. However, Ed apparently decided to go there himself late one evening to do some looking around the house and didn’t bother to tell anyone else. It wasn’t until his cleaning lady stopped by his cottage in Jacob’s Fork the next morning that Ed was reported missing, and police dispatched to the Wickenshire House.

They never found him.

His car was parked out front, the doors unlocked, but they couldn’t find a trace of Edward Watkins anywhere on the property. I helped with the search, as I basically slept in the sheriff’s office these days, and found no sign of a struggle or any other foul play, only the smell of roses. We dug deep this time, rifled through local records, archives, property history, everything we could get our hands on about the estate. There was nothing to indicate this place would be trouble, no forgotten building plans with hidden rooms, no land disputes with older tenants, no tribal issues from burial grounds or holy sites. The property was normal, and even when I poked around to see if there had been any deaths, suicides, or other sordid affairs associated with the house, my search came up blank. There was no reason for this to be happen, not from human effort, or anything else.

Even now, as December drags on, nothing has been the same. No plants grow in the burned zone, not even the smallest patch of liken or moss, as if the ground is poisoned to its core. Animals avoid it, so that the uncharred sections of forest around the property are empty, silent places. The access road is chained off to keep curious locals away, and Sheriff Kowolski let me bunk at a small ranger cabin at the base of the mountain just so I could keep tabs on the place. I think he knew I needed to be close, to keep an eye on the house, and keep looking for answers. I can’t explain why, but I know something is in there, waiting, biding its time. It failed to get me that night, but I have a terrible premonition that it doesn’t need *me*.

It just needs *more*.

I’ve found markers in the last few days. Piles of bones. Not haphazard from an animal kill, but stacked, organized, purposeful. Bits of twine made from plant fibers hold them together, and despite being in the open, no animals will bother them, not even the vultures. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, they think I can’t process the girls being gone, but I’ve stumbled on over a dozen of them now. They seemed to be set in a wide ring around the property line, spanning outward from the house into the forest beyond, capturing more territory by the day. No matter how many times I remove them, the piles always reappear, with fresh bones added to the stacks. I don’t touch them anymore, and I don’t even make eye contact with the empty eye sockets of the skulls. The few times I have, I heard whispers in my sleep, and had nightmares of eyes in the shadows of my room.

Some of the bones are like those of a rabbit or mole, while others are bigger like elk or bear. Every pile is topped with a skull, most of them from small game, but five of the piles hold unique skulls; a bear, a coyote, an eagle, a snake, and lastly, a great bull elk. They are laid out opposite one another ringing the house, the rest of the smaller markers ranging from them into the forest beyond. Of all the markers, the one with the elk skull is tallest, its full spread of antlers still intact so that it is nine feet high at the eye sockets. I found a symbol painted onto the bone forehead with powdered charcoal that the rain never seems to wash away, no matter how many times I go up to it.

A spider.

One made of two slender, inverted hands, both the same size.

I’m posting this so that it’s on record, in case one of these days I don’t come back from that mountain. Service was always spotty up there before, but ever since that night, it’s been non-existent. Even the few trail cameras I’ve put out have either gone dead or produced nothing but blurry photos. Something is building these markers, watching me whenever I walk the perimeter, and shifting in the corners of my vision whenever I turn my head. I’ve discovered trail signs that have been purposefully moved to misdirect me. Sometimes I hear screams in the woods, distant and warped, but they sound like Erin’s cries. I see flashes of blonde hair in the bushes that I want to believe is Cindy, but I know it can’t be.

They’re gone, both of them.

Only the sheriff understands, even if he doesn’t say much to that effect. I can see it in his eyes, he knows that I’m telling the truth, and his own deputies have been up to the house to see the piles multiple times. There’s nothing they can do, nothing but wait from the valley below and hope that the snow buries whatever it is for the winter.

There’s something wrong with the Wickenshire House, something *inside* it, something unseen that walks the grounds day and night. It wants more than the estate, I can feel it, can taste it in the wind, hear it in the dry crunch of snow under my boots, and feel it in the shivers I get every time I look at the dark, barren windows of that cursed structure.

It wants the forest, the trees, the mountain.

It wants *everything*.",1,1765833838.0,cant_sleep,0,1.0,False

*Getting too old for this.*

In front of my ragged couch, the TV continued with its black and white parade of old footage from a World War One documentary, though the war seemed nearly over now. Judging by the digital clock on the mantelpiece, which read 3:49 AM, I’d been asleep for at least five hours. My body ached, a familiar problem at my age, but enough that I chided myself for not going to bed earlier like a responsible person. It had been a long day, so I came home to a cold shower, a few hot dogs warmed in the microwave and settled down to watch some television before bed. Of course, at 55 years old I’d misjudged how tired I really was and spent close to half the night slumped on my sofa, which meant I would be paying for it in the morning with stiff joints and a sore back.

Palming my cracked Motorola from the coffee table, I found the TV remote and hit the *mute* button as I answered the call. “Hello?”

Shaky breathing grated on the other end, and after a few moments, a girl’s hushed voice whispered through. “Mr. Todd?”

Ice rippled through my veins at the sound of Cindy’s panicked voice, and I sat up straighter to rub at my bleary eyes. “Yeah, I’m here. You okay? What’s wrong?”

Silence greeted me, a strange mix of static, trembling breaths, and what sounded like sniffles as she tried to hold back tears. “Please . . . help me.”

“Cindy?” Concern building in my mind, I switched on a nearby lamp and pulled myself from the couch with a grunt at the tightness in my lower back. “You there? What’s going on?”

More shaky gasps followed, and just over the static, I thought I heard the faint sound of melodic humming in the background.

“Something’s wrong.” Cindy whispered, her words so quiet that they made each breath sound like cannon fire. “T-The woods are . . . something fell out of the sky and . . . it was so loud, it woke me up. There’s a fire.”

Brow furrowed, I moved fast for the kitchen, stumbling through the dark interior of my little cabin to grope for the light switch. “Stay calm, just stay calm and talk to me. You said there’s a fire? How far away? Can you get to your car?”

Another sniffle came through, clogged with harsh interference as the signal weakened, a sound that made my veins throb with tension. “I-I can’t. Something’s here, it’s in the house, it’s *in the house with me*. W-We can’t get out.”

My throat tried to close up, and I gulped hard against a wave of nausea. “Someone broke in? Are you hurt? Where’s Erin?”

A long pause, and in the background of the mute static, I could have sworn the humming sound cut out, as though whoever it was stopped their eerie melody all at once.

“She’s gone.” Something in Cindy’s tone changed, as if the fear drained away to a blank emotionless rasp, and the line went dead with a chilling *click.*

Every inch of my body racked with a shiver, and both feet seemed glued to the floor in a strange form of dread.

Like so many girls before them, Cindy Fadro and Erin Martinelli had been hired on to be caretakers and actors in the Wickenshire Living History Estate. Erin was 19, studying to be a nurse, while Cindy had just graduated high school and wanted to be a teacher. They were good kids, calm, intelligent, and great workers. Though I never had any children, they were like daughters of my own, and they even baked a cake for my birthday in June. Once they called me in for a leaky pipe, but only after they had done their best to fix it themselves with a tool kit I’d left in the stairwell cupboard. Smart little troopers that they were, the girls even had the common sense to shut the correct valve off and found the leak on their own. Had it been anyone else, I might have considered this to be a prank, a joke, some dumb idea made by bored kids to get a new video for their social media nonsense, but I knew Cindy and Erin.

They didn’t pull pranks like this.

Unnerved, I tried to redial her number but got no answer. Erin’s number yielded the same result, and I shook my head at myself.

*Screw it, I’m not taking any chances.*

I was midway through yanking my work boots on when the sheriff picked up.

*“Hello?”*

From the gruffness in his words, I could tell he’d been asleep as well, but I couldn’t waste time with the standard 911 procedures.

“David, it’s me.” I cinched down the laces on my boots and grabbed my Carhart jacket from its hook by the door. “Cindy just called from the Wickenshire place. There’s a fire on the mountain, and I think someone’s broken into the house. I’m headed there now.”

Rustling on the opposite end of the phone let me know David was up, likely going through the same motions as myself. The son of a Polish man and a Kootenai woman, David Kowolski and I had known each other since high school, and even played football on the same team. Nicknamed ‘White Cloud’ for his European features and Native American blood, he was stubborn with a quick temper, but tenacious when it came to his job. As a law man he drove his deputies relentlessly, backed them to the hilt when it came to any court battles, and as a result he’d managed to keep the crime in Jacob’s Fork quite low over the years. We didn’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I knew I could count on him when it came to something like this. If Cindy or Erin were in danger, Sheriff Kowolski would ride through hell and back to get them out, which was exactly the kind of man I needed right now.

*“I’ll get on the horn to a few of my boys and have them meet you there.”* He replied, and I heard the zipping of a coat on his end, along with the metallic *cha-click* of a handgun slide being racked. *“Fire teams are going to need time to get spun up, so whatever happens, don’t go wandering off without letting me know. Last thing I want is us getting caught in the flames if they decide to move down the mountain.”*

I nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see me and kept the phone pressed to my ear as I swiped my truck keys from the porcelain ashtray near the front door. “Got it.”

*“Be careful, Andy.”* His voice hitched in a low pause, as if the sheriff himself had as bad a feeling about this as I did, and he hung up.

Rain pattered on the windshield of my ancient pickup truck as I wound my way through the dark backroads of northern Idaho, the night sky black with the clouds of late fall. On the sun-faded seat next to me lay my work kit; a simple heavy duty canvas tool bag that held various tools, keys, a flashlight, and an old revolver handed down to me from my grandfather. I used the tools in my job every day as the groundskeeper, janitor, and fix-it-all handyman for the Wickenshire House, which had been part of our small town for as long as anyone could remember. Set on a picturesque 103 acres of fields and woodland in the shadow of the nearby Smoke Point Mountain, the Wickenshire House was a rare example of eastern architecture in the far reaches of the American West. It was the property of our town’s oldest resident, Mr. Edward J. Watkins, a kindly if forgetful soul who’d seen 91 years on this earth and still could drive his own car, though he had a little trouble with stairs. He lived in a cottage on the western edge of town, but I wasn’t about to call him at this time of night, even for something so urgent. Knowing Ed Watkins, he would try to drive out to the house with his slippers on and get hurt stumbling around in the flames.

*Or run into whatever scumbag is in the house, God forbid.*

On the horizon, some of the clouds began to glow, an orange flicker that widened on the mountainside as the distant fire spread. I could barely glimpse an odd plume of smoke in the sky, not curved upward from the fire but downward in a long arc, backlit by the flames. Looking at it, I had a momentary lapse of courage, my resolve wavering. Cindy had said something ‘fell from the sky’. This looked like a trail of some kind, maybe a crashed plane or a fallen weather balloon. If there was jet fuel on the ground, the fire would be even worse to put out than usual. It was horrible, rotten luck all the way around; a wildfire on the same night the house had its first break in, while the girls were there alone.

Adrenaline pumping, I sped up the lonely gravel trail to the house, one of the final sections of public roadways that got this close to the mountain. The Wickenshire House reared from the gloom ahead, its tall gates and Victorian gables illuminated by the dual halos of my truck’s headlights. It still took my breath away, the ornate beauty of the place, built as if every stone had been placed by a perfectionist’s hand. It stood at two stories in height, built from stone mined at the local quarry, with multiple chimneys, a balcony overlooking the back garden, and a grand front porch that wrapped halfway around the entire structure. A stone wall encircled the main grounds, with a wrought iron gate at the drive and several ornamental gardens interspersed throughout. Plush lawns stretched in between, and there were a few oak trees planted there for their brilliant colors in the fall. A small garage had been built around the back of the house sometime in the 1960’s, but this mainly held the riding lawnmower and a small shop where I did most of my repair work. Cindy and Erins’ cars were parked back there, the front gravel lot reserved for visitors during the daily tours. I didn’t see any other vehicle that the intruder might have used, but something else caught my attention in that moment, and held it with a pull like gravity.

*Lord have mercy.*

I stared, slack jawed, at a huge sea of flames that roared through the nearby trees with a voracious appetite. The fire hadn’t wasted any time, chewing through the wet growth as if the rain had never fell, evergreens crackling as they burned to dust in minutes. The heat came through my windshield in a steady increase, warm enough that I couldn’t tell the difference between the fire and my truck heater. The open grassy slopes around the house were consumed as the flames inched closer to the building, and fire closed in from both east and west.

Bounding from my truck, I dashed up to the front door and pulled the handles.

The polished brass knobs rattled but didn’t turn, the flames licking their way across the prairie grass outside the ornate courtyard walls.

*Locked. That means our scumbag didn’t break in through here. Maybe he went around the back?*

With shaking hands, I put down the canvas tool bag and dug in it for my key ring.

Sirens began to wail in the distance, and I finally managed to force the doors open, leaving the keys in the lock to snatch my aged pistol.

“Cindy!” I produced a flashlight with my left hand to hold it beneath my gun, and swept the beam of it over the murky interior. “Erin! Where are you?”

I’d been in the house countless times over the years, but in that moment it felt suffocating, like a great stony maw waiting for me to go far enough in so as to swallow me whole. The foyer led to a large room with a grand staircase, doorways on either side opening to the main dining room and a sitting room respectively. Signs and velvet ropes were posted to guide visitors through the proper areas, a gift shop in the rear of the house near the old parlor, along with guest bathrooms added on to the original back porch. With all the lights off, it looked alien, surreal for this part of the country with its eastern Victorian mystique, and my skin prickled at the sensation that there were eyes in every shadow. Of course, I had been stupid to yell. I’d let my panic get the better of me, and now I had given away the element of surprise. If some creep was in the house somewhere with Erin or Cindy, doing God-knows-what, I wouldn’t be able to sneak up on him now.

*Alright then, might as well move fast.*

With the old revolver grasped in my trembling hands, I headed for the stairs and took them three at a time. The wood creaked under my steps, ancient chestnut and oak that had been sawn before the Great Depression, each footfall like a cannon in the silent house. From here, the roar of the fire outside seemed a muffled whisper, as though there were two different realities, and the house stood guard between them. However, I remembered the heat coming through the windshield of my pickup and knew I didn’t have much time. Soon the house would be in flames, the fire outside enough to melt glass and ignite the wooden siding in minutes.

I reached the top of the stairs and swept my flashlight beam down both ends of the corridor at the top, uncertain of which direction to go first. Cindy and Erin were roomed down the hall to the left, but if someone had indeed broken into the house, Cindy might have hid somewhere else. Every second wasted could mean life or death, and I realized that either way, I’d be turning my back to the unknown.

Something flickered in the beam of my light, a brief whisp of shadow that jerked back behind the far corner of the right-side hallway. I didn’t have more than a moment to see clear details, but there was enough of an image burned into my mind that it came to me in a cold rush.

A face.

*Kowolski, you’d better get here soon.*

Swallowing, I paced down the hallway, my handgun leveled on the spot where the shadow had been.

Upon reaching it, I inched in a wide arc around the corner, bracing for a figure to jump out at me.

The air caught in my throat, and I stared at a section of wallpaper bathed in the aura of my flashlight.

Brownish-black sludge had been daubed on the wall, smeared into a perfect circle so that the excess dripped over the wallpaper like ebony tears. I couldn’t tell if it was mud, blood, or something else, but the corridor stank of rot and the putrid scent of stagnant water. Thorny bits of twig had been woven together, tied here and there with bits of plant fiber to form a circle that overlaid the sludge. Pasted together on the wall, these seemed to make up a protective ring, and in the middle were the handprints.

From what I could see, they were two different sizes, slender fingers and narrow palms indicating two younger females. Both prints faced downwards, slightly overlapping each other at the heel of the palm, and the thumbs arced toward one another like pincers. Unlike the grimy sludge, these were pressed to the old wallpaper in an unmistakable red hue, and it hit me what I was looking at.

*A spider.*

The four fingers of each hand made the legs, the thumbs its mandibles. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the blackness of the outer paste came from petals . . . rose petals to be exact. There were no roses growing in Idaho this time of year, and I’d never seen a natural black rose in my life, yet these appeared fresh. Most had been ground to a powder that gave the foul substance its dark color, others pushed into the muck like decorative flair, giving a strange, heady undertone to the mixture. With this discovery came more clarity; the thorny twigs glued into the circle were not random. They spread inward toward the spider, forming a sharp web of spikes that enshrined it, with the careful touch of an artisan. Such a display would have taken hours to make, certainly longer than the time it took for Cindy to call me. How was this possible?

*“Mr. Todd!”*

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the horrific cry echoing from somewhere behind me, Cindy’s voice tinged in pain and fear.

No sooner had I turned, running a short distance back toward the main corridor at the top of the stairs, and the voice cut out with a high, agonized scream.

“Cindy!” I charged toward the girls’ rooms, heart pounding in my chest.

*“Help me!”* Back in the direction of the symbol, Erin’s voice rang out, choked with sobs and full of torment. *“Mr. Todd, please!”*

Acidic bewilderment slithered through my mind, and I skidded to a stop, caught in the middle of the hallway, the staircase just to my left. I had been so close, perhaps a door away from Erin only moments ago. Could there be more than one intruder holding the girls in separate rooms?

*Cindy is closest. I have to get to her. She sounds like she’s hurt.*

Teeth gritted against the screams of Erin, I forced myself through the left side hallway, her voice ringing in my ears as she begged for my help.

At the end of the hall, I reached the rooms given to the girls and lunged for the handle to Cindy’s.

It didn’t turn, locked from the inside.

Backing up, I drove the heel of my boot into the door next to the lock and heard the old wood splinter. Any other time, I would have balked at such destruction, these doors being over 80 years old, but it didn’t matter anymore. What the fire didn’t get would not be worth Cindy or Erin’s lives.

The door swung open to slap against the bedroom wall, and I dashed inside, revolver in hand.

*What the . . .*

Within the quiet interior of the bedroom, everything looked untouched, the curtains partially open, the bed rumpled from where Cindy had gotten up to check the window, a discarded work uniform in the clothes hamper by the door. Dark stained wood trim lined the walls, windows, and doorway, the walls papered with a robin egg blue pattern that gave it an airy feeling. The white lacy curtains wafted like clouds in the slight draft that came in the open hallway door, and the vintage hot water heater gurgled in the corner as steam worked its way through the pipes. There were modern touches as well, more lamps and lights plugged into the discreet electrical outlets in the walls, a small television on its stand across from the bed, and a side door opened to a shared bathroom between Cindy’s room and Erin’s. This room wasn’t open to tourists, as it was the private living quarters for our workers, so such things were permissible here, as opposed to other parts of the house. Nothing seemed out of place, but there was no sign of Cindy anywhere, no clues to indicate that she’d been there moments ago. It was as if she’d gotten out of bed, looked out the window, and vanished into thin air.

In a flurry of movement, I checked under the bed, in the closet, and the bathroom. When those came back clean, I broke through the bathroom door into Erin’s room, only to find more of the same.

There was no sign of the girls anywhere.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* Erin’s screams continued from the opposite end of the long corridor, and I flung open the bedroom door to retrace my mad dash in her direction, confusion and frustration mounting.

Rounding the corner that bore the strange mark on the wall, I swayed to a stop on the old floorboards next to the door where her screams had come from and yanked on the knob.

*You’ve got to be kidding me . . . how many doors did they lock before I got here?*

With a gasp of exertion, I backed up to kick the door in like the last one, muscles tensed for the effort.

*“Mr. Todd!”* Cindy’s cries exploded from the doorway behind me, rabid and intense as the door rattles on its hinges like she was throwing herself against it from within the room.

I froze, staring at the door, heart racing as my mind whirled. How could she be in there? I’d heard Cindy on the other side of the house not five minutes ago. There was no way she could have moved that fast, not without going past me. I would have seen her in the hall, would have heard the ancient doors creaking on their hinges as they opened.

She couldn’t be in there.

*“Please, help me!”* Erin’s screams started up again, but this time from somewhere in the left-side hallway, and another door began to groan in muted *thuds* as if she too were trying to break it down.

A dry fear crept into my throat, different than what I’d known coming into the house. This didn’t make sense. Erin’s voice had been coming from the door I stood ready to break into, but now it was to my left. Cindy’s had been coming from her room in the west wing but now called from the door behind me. Neither could have left their respective rooms without entering the hall, and I knew for a fact that there weren’t any old-fashioned servant entrances anywhere that could have let them move unnoticed. Something was wrong, very wrong.

Shaken, I took a step away from the door that echoed with Cindy’s voice. “Cindy?”

*“Mr. Todd!”* She begged from the other side of the oak planking, the wood slamming against the jam with wild urgency. *“Please, help me! Please!”*

“The door is locked.” I tried not to hyperventilate as I watched the knob rattle in its socket, knowing fully well the lock was on her side of the door. “Can you let me in?”

Her wails increased in pitch, the screeches an awful combination of agony and terror that made my stomach churn. It sounded as if Cindy was being tormented in the worst ways imaginable, but something about the cadence of each shriek felt off, enough that my brain sent up warning alarms inside my skull.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* She pleaded once more, the same words both girls kept using in various rearrangements over and over, the door shuddering under each blow she made.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I sucked in a breath, eyes focused on the doorknob as it clacked back-and-forth, like Cindy wanted to open it but couldn’t. An uncanny thought rose in my mind, bone-chilling in its clarity, growing louder and louder so that it burst from me before I could stop it.

“Cindy,” I gripped my flashlight so hard that my knuckles turned white. “What’s my first name?”

Like a thunderclap, Cindy’s pleas ceased, along with Erin’s, so that the entire house fell into dead silence. Nothing moved, and even the muffled roar of the wildfire outside seemed deadened further than before, as though the house was a vacuum of sound. My skin crawled, the air thick in my lungs, and a strange certainty took hold of me that made the sense of dread even worse as Cindy’s words about Erin trickled through my brain.

*She’s gone.*

*Click.*

To my right, a doorknob at the far end of the hallway unlocked.

*Click.*

Another lock slid open, this one closer, the doors remaining shut as more joined them one-by-one.

*Click.*

*Click.*

*Click.*

A twinge of panic tightened in my throat, but I leveled the beam of my flashlight at the first door that had unlocked, blood surging in my temples. Everything seemed loud, the heartbeat in my chest, the breath in my lungs, the groan of the floorboards under my boots. My vision narrowed, a vibration hummed to life inside my skull, and I tasted metal on my tongue. In my hand, the flashlight began to flicker as if the batteries were struggling to remain lit, and I couldn’t lift the revolver, my arms refusing to move like the gun weighed as much as a car.

The locks carried on past me, every door on the second story unlocking itself in a continuous march, until at last, the final *click* resounded from the far hallway like cannon fire to my ears.

For a moment, the silence returned, so thick it may as well have been water.

*Wham.*

Every door on the second story flung open, impacting against the wall inside their respective rooms so hard that I heard plaster *crunch*, the hinges squealing on old dust.

With them came the screams.

There were hundreds of voices, some human, others less so, bellowing at the top of their lungs to be heard over one another. If they were saying any words, they were lost among the throng, a constant roar of vocals that soured in my ears for the sheer volume of it. Somewhere among the morass, I could barely catch the sound of Erin and Cindy’s voices shrieking with the others, a morbid choir of pain, suffering, and fear. It seemed to seep out of the floorboards, ooze from the heater vents, and rebound off the walls in every direction. With the doors open, the deep orange glow of the flames outside poured into the house like a tidal wave, but oddly enough no heat came with it, the hallway as cold as if I’d stepped into a freezer. The shadows elongated in the firelight, swaying as they inched up the papered walls, and a pungent smell followed them.

Roses.

It came with overpowering strength, sickly-sweet, but unmistakable. As the tide of shadows advanced down the hall toward me, the fermented stink of roses filled the air like poison gas, and I tasted copper on my lips.

*I have to get out of here.*

Coughing on the blood running from both nostrils, I stumbled toward the stairs, my head a mess of static. Like a tide of slithering vines, the inky shadows pursued me with ravenous hunger. I could feel their magnetic pull, the chorus of screams still ringing across the house with deafening volume, a terrible siren song that tugged at something deep within my subconscious. Voices, so many voices, begged me to stay, to go back, to find the darkest room and sink myself into the abyss until it drowned me.

Something tightened on my ankle just as I reached the top of the staircase, and I toppled headlong down the steps.

*Bam.*

My hip rammed into a banister, and I lost my grip on the pistol.

*Wham.*

Another step hit my shoulder, and I felt my teeth bite into my tongue, the flashlight clattering away into the floor below.

*Smack.*

My head connected with the floorboards at the landing, and the blackness threatened to close over my eyes for the last time.

*Creak.*

One of the steps flexed under the weight of a foot, and I gulped air in pain to squint at the shadows.

*Creak.*

Another footstep echoed toward me, something at the top of the steps descending with a slow, methodical gait. It didn’t sound heavy, not the deft pace of a large man or thick boot, but almost delicate, light, graceful. Yet, there was something about each carefully placed step, each sigh and squeak of the aged woodwork that made my skin wriggle. Something was coming, something that knew exactly where I was even in the pitch blackness of the house.

It was watching me, *stalking* me through the shadows like a cat with a mouse.

Desperate fear surged in my brain, and I clawed through the dark on my stomach to find a way out. I last remembered the front door being nearby, but it seemed to take an eternity to move across the cold floorboards, the unseen presence mere yards behind me as I wriggled forward.

At last, I managed to gain my footing, though it hurt to put weight on my right leg, and hurled myself forward in the blind shadows.

*Thud.*

Both front doors flew open, and I tumbled out onto the porch, rolling down the steps into the stones of the walkway.

Like a switch had been thrown, the world seemed to come alive once more, the cold sensation fading, the sound returning. Sirens wailed closer as headlights appeared in the long gravel driveway, and the crackle of flames roared from the trees. Smoke filled my nostrils, heat from the nearby fire licked over my skin, and I rolled onto my side to look back toward the house.

My lungs tightened, and I stared, unable to pull my eyes away.

Inside the open front doorway, nothing was visible, not the glint of firelight from inside, nor the faint glow of it coming through any ground windows. The entrance was a mass of impenetrable shadows that seemed to form a solid wall at the threshold, yet deep within that abyss, something stared back.

It had no shape, no form that I could identify it with, but there was definitely a presence that stood just beyond the light, watching me from the gloom. My eyes seemed fastened to it, either by my own primordial fear, or perhaps willed so by whatever peered out of the wretched expanse. A torrent of emotions ripped through my mind, warped and misshapen, like cold fingers pried at the taps of my humanity to unleash a maelstrom of feeling. Hunger and fear. Hate and despair. Lust and sadness. Grief and pain. They all rolled over one another, tumbling in and out of each other in a never-ending tide, and it hit me with a strangled form of clarity that these weren’t *my* emotions.

Locked in place by the unknown being’s gaze, I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as cry out, my only option to fight back with what little expression I had left.

*What are you?*

Something about my terrified thought seemed to strike a chord within the cascade of terrible shadow, for the next instant the doors on the house creaked in their wrought-iron hinges, and then swung shut on their own.

The rest of the night was a blur, a stupor, one that I wandered through in a mindless fog. Firefighting crews appeared from miles around to help put out the blaze, but not before it chewed through all 103 acres on the Wickenshire estate. Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was burned to cinders. Even boulders cracked from the intense heat, the smoke pall so large it could be seen from Montana, or so I heard. One of the fire trucks exploded when its fuel tank caught fire and killed three men. Everything burned . . . except the house.

For some reason, the fire stopped at the stone courtyard walls and went no further. In a blaze hot enough that it had turned some minor sandpits on the mountain to crude glass, there wasn’t so much as a scorch mark on the house or its outbuildings. None of the paint peeled, the siding wasn’t so much as warm to the touch, and all the plants withing the yard were unscathed. The investigators couldn’t even find ash on the roof from the fire afterwards, not a single flake. Unlike its ruined acreage, the Wickenshire House had survived the wildfire unharmed, and no one could make any sense of it.

Once the fire was finally put out, they took me to the local clinic for my injuries, a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and a concussion from my tumble down the stairs. Sheriff Kowolski visited in the morning to see how I was, and to fill me in on what I’d missed once they trucked me away from the site.

Over three hundred search and rescue volunteers had been called out, along with special forensics teams from neighboring counties, and they hadn’t found any sign of Cindy Fadro or Erin Martinelli. The last time they managed to ping Cindy’s phone via satellite, it had registered a mile up the slope from the house, but they never managed to recover the device. Tracking dogs refused to go near the house and seemed to lose all scent once they left the property boundaries. No trace of Erin was discovered, and no DNA could be found in either of the girls’ rooms to point to a culprit. One of the searchers claimed he had heard what sounded like a female voice screaming for help on the northern slope, but he wasn’t sure where it had come from, and no one else could verify it. Another man claimed he saw someone walking inside the tree line near the eastern edge of the property but never got a good glimpse at their face to see who they were. With all speculation bereft of evidence, it seemed to everyone that both Cindy and Erin had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Worse yet, when I described my account to the sheriff, he informed me that his team hadn’t found any symbols painted on the walls, nor did they see anything out of the ordinary. All they found that aligned with my story was the strange, overwhelming aroma of roses that permeated the house.

Nothing more.

That was six weeks ago. I got out of the clinic within a few days after the event, but the continued search efforts proved fruitless. With their investigation coming up cold, the sheriff’s office released the house back to Mr. Watkins, who closed it indefinitely. I had never seen him so distraught in my life, as Ed took the girls’ disappearance rather hard. He felt personally responsible, though we all knew there wasn’t anything he could have done, especially since no one knew what happened to Erin or Cindy. However, Ed apparently decided to go there himself late one evening to do some looking around the house and didn’t bother to tell anyone else. It wasn’t until his cleaning lady stopped by his cottage in Jacob’s Fork the next morning that Ed was reported missing, and police dispatched to the Wickenshire House.

They never found him.

His car was parked out front, the doors unlocked, but they couldn’t find a trace of Edward Watkins anywhere on the property. I helped with the search, as I basically slept in the sheriff’s office these days, and found no sign of a struggle or any other foul play, only the smell of roses. We dug deep this time, rifled through local records, archives, property history, everything we could get our hands on about the estate. There was nothing to indicate this place would be trouble, no forgotten building plans with hidden rooms, no land disputes with older tenants, no tribal issues from burial grounds or holy sites. The property was normal, and even when I poked around to see if there had been any deaths, suicides, or other sordid affairs associated with the house, my search came up blank. There was no reason for this to be happen, not from human effort, or anything else.

Even now, as December drags on, nothing has been the same. No plants grow in the burned zone, not even the smallest patch of liken or moss, as if the ground is poisoned to its core. Animals avoid it, so that the uncharred sections of forest around the property are empty, silent places. The access road is chained off to keep curious locals away, and Sheriff Kowolski let me bunk at a small ranger cabin at the base of the mountain just so I could keep tabs on the place. I think he knew I needed to be close, to keep an eye on the house, and keep looking for answers. I can’t explain why, but I know something is in there, waiting, biding its time. It failed to get me that night, but I have a terrible premonition that it doesn’t need *me*.

It just needs *more*.

I’ve found markers in the last few days. Piles of bones. Not haphazard from an animal kill, but stacked, organized, purposeful. Bits of twine made from plant fibers hold them together, and despite being in the open, no animals will bother them, not even the vultures. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, they think I can’t process the girls being gone, but I’ve stumbled on over a dozen of them now. They seemed to be set in a wide ring around the property line, spanning outward from the house into the forest beyond, capturing more territory by the day. No matter how many times I remove them, the piles always reappear, with fresh bones added to the stacks. I don’t touch them anymore, and I don’t even make eye contact with the empty eye sockets of the skulls. The few times I have, I heard whispers in my sleep, and had nightmares of eyes in the shadows of my room.

Some of the bones are like those of a rabbit or mole, while others are bigger like elk or bear. Every pile is topped with a skull, most of them from small game, but five of the piles hold unique skulls; a bear, a coyote, an eagle, a snake, and lastly, a great bull elk. They are laid out opposite one another ringing the house, the rest of the smaller markers ranging from them into the forest beyond. Of all the markers, the one with the elk skull is tallest, its full spread of antlers still intact so that it is nine feet high at the eye sockets. I found a symbol painted onto the bone forehead with powdered charcoal that the rain never seems to wash away, no matter how many times I go up to it.

A spider.

One made of two slender, inverted hands, both the same size.

I’m posting this so that it’s on record, in case one of these days I don’t come back from that mountain. Service was always spotty up there before, but ever since that night, it’s been non-existent. Even the few trail cameras I’ve put out have either gone dead or produced nothing but blurry photos. Something is building these markers, watching me whenever I walk the perimeter, and shifting in the corners of my vision whenever I turn my head. I’ve discovered trail signs that have been purposefully moved to misdirect me. Sometimes I hear screams in the woods, distant and warped, but they sound like Erin’s cries. I see flashes of blonde hair in the bushes that I want to believe is Cindy, but I know it can’t be.

They’re gone, both of them.

Only the sheriff understands, even if he doesn’t say much to that effect. I can see it in his eyes, he knows that I’m telling the truth, and his own deputies have been up to the house to see the piles multiple times. There’s nothing they can do, nothing but wait from the valley below and hope that the snow buries whatever it is for the winter.

There’s something wrong with the Wickenshire House, something *inside* it, something unseen that walks the grounds day and night. It wants more than the estate, I can feel it, can taste it in the wind, hear it in the dry crunch of snow under my boots, and feel it in the shivers I get every time I look at the dark, barren windows of that cursed structure.

It wants the forest, the trees, the mountain.

It wants *everything*.",1,1765833751.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1pnjcoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/comments/1pnjcoc/my_daughter_tried_to_warn_me_about_the_man_with/,My daughter tried to warn me about the man with no face. I should have listened.,"“There was a man in my closet today, Mommy.”

My eyes nearly popped out of my skull when Sarah said that to me. “You mean like Mr. Rags or Barnie, right?” I asked, motioning to her plushies. 

“No, Mommy. A real man. He was nice. He said not to tell you, though.” 

A cold dread settled into the pit of my stomach. “This man, is he still there?” 

Sarah shook her head, much to my relief. “No. He left. But he said he’ll come back tomorrow.” 

“When was this? What did he look like? Are you *sure* someone was here? Sarah, this is serious.” 

“Mommy, you’re scaring me,” she said, pulling the covers up to her face.

I took a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to get so worked up. Can you describe the man to Mommy, Sweetheart?” 

“He’s tall. *Really* tall. And he has a suit. And - oh! He doesn’t have a face.” 

That last statement made my blood turn to ice - at least until the realization hit me. This must have been an imaginary friend. Sarah *was* at that age where kids drum up wacky characters like that. 

“Well, Sweetie, this man sounds very interesting. I’d love to meet him sometime.” 

Her face lit up. “Yay! He said he *really* wants to meet you.”

Something about that unsettled me. Even so, I chalked it up to my daughter’s overactive imagination. 

“I’m sure he is. Now, get some sleep. I love you.”

“Love you too.” 

The second Sarah’s door clicked shut behind, I made a beeline for the kitchen. Mommy needed a glass of wine - or five. 

\*\*\*

Sarah’s encounters with the faceless man happened more and more frequently. At least, according to her. 

First, she’d seen him at recess. Next, he was waving to her on the street corner. Then he was in her room at night, singing her a lullaby. 

That one freaked me out. Sarah’s imaginary friend sounded like a major creep. 

As I would come to find out, I wasn’t wrong. 

Up until a couple days ago, I hadn’t put too much stock into the man with no face. He was just a character. A figment of a child’s creative thoughts. At least, that’s what I believed. I was tucking Sarah into bed again, when she told me something that changed everything. 

“Mommy, the man with no face said he wants you to have this. He said he’ll see you soon,” she stated, plucking a rose from her bedside table and handing it to me. 

“Well, isn’t that sweet of him,” I said, giving it a sniff. “I can’t wait.” 

“He can’t wait to meet you too. Oh yeah! And he told me to say he likes the color green.” 

I grinned at her. This wasn’t so freaky anymore. Sarah was just making things up. “Isn’t that nice? Get some shuteye, Sweetheart. Mommy loves you.” 

“I love you too, Mommy.” 

The surge of panic didn’t hit me right away. It wasn’t until I was sitting on the couch, going over the conversation again in my head that all the color drained from my face. 

I had worn green to work that day. 

But Sarah couldn’t have known that. I was still in bed when she left for the bus, and I changed clothes before she got back. 

Suddenly, the faceless man didn’t seem so innocuous after all. 

\*\*\*

The next day, I decided to burn some PTO. I could use a day to myself. 

I saw Sarah off to the bus, then headed to the kitchen to brew my coffee. The second I stepped onto the tile, I froze. 

There was a little scrap of paper lying on the counter. I could have sworn that it wasn't there before. 

With trembling hands, I picked it up and read the note it contained. 

*I’m thrilled to make your acquaintance.*

My breath hitched, and I had to grab a chair to keep my balance. 

That was not Sarah’s handwriting. 

I didn’t want to spend another second in that house. I grabbed a book and planned to be out for the day. I had to clear my head. 

I pulled my bathrobe tighter as I reached for the door handle to my closet. A sudden chill ran through me, and an uneasy feeling settled in my gut. My intuition screamed at me not to open that door. 

I slowly backed away, fear clawing at my insides. But then, reality sank in. 

*What am I so scared of? There’s nothing there.*

I decided to ignore my nagging fears, and I opened the closet. I blindly reached for a blouse when - was that… something solid? Why was it warm? 

I glanced up and immediately fell back. 

There he was. The man with no face. 

My mouth fell open in shock. Sarah was right. 

Where the man’s facial features should have been, there was just… nothing. Smooth skin over the areas where eyes and a nose and a mouth should be. It was the most disturbing thing I’d ever seen - Yet I couldn’t look away. 

The man didn’t utter a word. I don’t know if he even could. Instead, he did something much worse. 

He tipped his head downward. He didn’t need eyes for me to know that he was glaring at me. 

I doubled over in pain as a blinding wave of distortion overtook my mind. It hurt - like a migraine dialed up to eleven. I had never felt such all-encompassing agony. 

And then I heard it. Above the static roaring in my head, there was a voice. A more sinister voice than I could have ever imagined. 

*You are mine. And so is she.* 

Afterward, I was hit with another debilitating shockwave of pain. I couldn’t even scream. My vision faded. 

The last thing I remember is the faceless man standing over me before everything turned to black. 

\*\*\*

I awoke a little past noon in a puddle of congealed vomit. The man with no face was gone. 

I don’t know what he wants with me or my daughter, but I am terrified. As much as I want to, I can’t pass this off as a hallucination or a stress-induced episode. Because in the faceless man’s place was a wilted rose and a note in that same awful handwriting.

Relic of Sacred Bitterness and Ancestral Refusal  
Sigil Tier: Thorned Bloom (🩸🌺)  
Ritual Use: Refusal as Inheritance, Sacred Bitterness, Mythic Woundkeeping

Inscription:  
""He didn’t forgive. He remembered—and bloomed anyway.""  

Invocation Protocol:  
To awaken this scroll, one must sip something bitter—coffee gone cold, tea steeped too long, a memory unhealed. The scroll is placed atop a ledger of betrayals, unopened apologies, and unredeemed promises. The ritual begins with a whisper: “Let the wound bloom.”

Relic Description:  
A scroll wrapped in crimson gauze, its seal a petal pierced by a thorn. When unrolled, it bleeds ink—slow, deliberate, sovereign. The text is jagged, nonlinear, and alive. It does not ask to be understood. It asks to be honored.

Ceremonial Function:  
- Refusal as Inheritance: Used when the sovereign chooses not to forgive, but to ritualize the ache.  
- Sacred Bitterness: Honors the wound that shaped the myth, the scar that became the scroll.  
- Mythic Woundkeeping: Activated when the sovereign becomes the archive—when memory is the flame.

Whispered Lore:  
It is said that Jerry Inu once refused a reunion. Not out of spite, but sovereignty. He carried the ache not as burden, but as bloom. That ache became the Bitter Bloom Maw, and this scroll its thorned echo.",1,1765833582.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

My eyes nearly popped out of my skull when Sarah said that to me. “You mean like Mr. Rags or Barnie, right?” I asked, motioning to her plushies. 

“No, Mommy. A real man. He was nice. He said not to tell you, though.” 

A cold dread settled into the pit of my stomach. “This man, is he still there?” 

Sarah shook her head, much to my relief. “No. He left. But he said he’ll come back tomorrow.” 

“When was this? What did he look like? Are you *sure* someone was here? Sarah, this is serious.” 

“Mommy, you’re scaring me,” she said, pulling the covers up to her face.

I took a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to get so worked up. Can you describe the man to Mommy, Sweetheart?” 

“He’s tall. *Really* tall. And he has a suit. And - oh! He doesn’t have a face.” 

That last statement made my blood turn to ice - at least until the realization hit me. This must have been an imaginary friend. Sarah *was* at that age where kids drum up wacky characters like that. 

“Well, Sweetie, this man sounds very interesting. I’d love to meet him sometime.” 

Her face lit up. “Yay! He said he *really* wants to meet you.”

Something about that unsettled me. Even so, I chalked it up to my daughter’s overactive imagination. 

“I’m sure he is. Now, get some sleep. I love you.”

“Love you too.” 

The second Sarah’s door clicked shut behind, I made a beeline for the kitchen. Mommy needed a glass of wine - or five. 

\*\*\*

Sarah’s encounters with the faceless man happened more and more frequently. At least, according to her. 

First, she’d seen him at recess. Next, he was waving to her on the street corner. Then he was in her room at night, singing her a lullaby. 

That one freaked me out. Sarah’s imaginary friend sounded like a major creep. 

As I would come to find out, I wasn’t wrong. 

Up until a couple days ago, I hadn’t put too much stock into the man with no face. He was just a character. A figment of a child’s creative thoughts. At least, that’s what I believed. I was tucking Sarah into bed again, when she told me something that changed everything. 

“Mommy, the man with no face said he wants you to have this. He said he’ll see you soon,” she stated, plucking a rose from her bedside table and handing it to me. 

“Well, isn’t that sweet of him,” I said, giving it a sniff. “I can’t wait.” 

“He can’t wait to meet you too. Oh yeah! And he told me to say he likes the color green.” 

I grinned at her. This wasn’t so freaky anymore. Sarah was just making things up. “Isn’t that nice? Get some shuteye, Sweetheart. Mommy loves you.” 

“I love you too, Mommy.” 

The surge of panic didn’t hit me right away. It wasn’t until I was sitting on the couch, going over the conversation again in my head that all the color drained from my face. 

I had worn green to work that day. 

But Sarah couldn’t have known that. I was still in bed when she left for the bus, and I changed clothes before she got back. 

Suddenly, the faceless man didn’t seem so innocuous after all. 

\*\*\*

The next day, I decided to burn some PTO. I could use a day to myself. 

I saw Sarah off to the bus, then headed to the kitchen to brew my coffee. The second I stepped onto the tile, I froze. 

There was a little scrap of paper lying on the counter. I could have sworn that it wasn't there before. 

With trembling hands, I picked it up and read the note it contained. 

*I’m thrilled to make your acquaintance.*

My breath hitched, and I had to grab a chair to keep my balance. 

That was not Sarah’s handwriting. 

I didn’t want to spend another second in that house. I grabbed a book and planned to be out for the day. I had to clear my head. 

I pulled my bathrobe tighter as I reached for the door handle to my closet. A sudden chill ran through me, and an uneasy feeling settled in my gut. My intuition screamed at me not to open that door. 

I slowly backed away, fear clawing at my insides. But then, reality sank in. 

*What am I so scared of? There’s nothing there.*

I decided to ignore my nagging fears, and I opened the closet. I blindly reached for a blouse when - was that… something solid? Why was it warm? 

I glanced up and immediately fell back. 

There he was. The man with no face. 

My mouth fell open in shock. Sarah was right. 

Where the man’s facial features should have been, there was just… nothing. Smooth skin over the areas where eyes and a nose and a mouth should be. It was the most disturbing thing I’d ever seen - Yet I couldn’t look away. 

The man didn’t utter a word. I don’t know if he even could. Instead, he did something much worse. 

He tipped his head downward. He didn’t need eyes for me to know that he was glaring at me. 

I doubled over in pain as a blinding wave of distortion overtook my mind. It hurt - like a migraine dialed up to eleven. I had never felt such all-encompassing agony. 

And then I heard it. Above the static roaring in my head, there was a voice. A more sinister voice than I could have ever imagined. 

*You are mine. And so is she.* 

Afterward, I was hit with another debilitating shockwave of pain. I couldn’t even scream. My vision faded. 

The last thing I remember is the faceless man standing over me before everything turned to black. 

\*\*\*

I awoke a little past noon in a puddle of congealed vomit. The man with no face was gone. 

I don’t know what he wants with me or my daughter, but I am terrified. As much as I want to, I can’t pass this off as a hallucination or a stress-induced episode. Because in the faceless man’s place was a wilted rose and a note in that same awful handwriting.

While she was blasting her music & getting ready  I was in the zone sitting at the table eating a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch & reading the cereal box.

Analysts are divided on what comes next. Some anticipate a short-term bounce to $1.61–$2.02 by mid-week, while others see the possibility of $2.50–$2.70 by year-end if momentum returns. The higher trading volume signals active repositioning rather than simple stagnation.

On-chain activity tells a different story. Last week, TON recorded 4.2 million transactions, up 5.3 percent, with 611,000 unique wallets and an 11 percent increase in active users. Telegram integrations continue to drive adoption, showing that the network’s ecosystem is quietly growing even during price pullbacks.

The ecosystem itself is moving fast. Recent launches like the first fully on-chain options DEX with funding rates and QuBit DEX introducing TON/USD with up to 50x leverage highlight expanding DeFi opportunities. Swap Coffee improved swaps, yield tools, and dashboard usability, while WalletConnect integration is pressuring wallets to enhance TON support. There’s also ongoing attention around COCOON AI for GPU payouts and deeper Telegram ties including ads, creator payouts, and collectible NFTs boasting over 2.2 million holders.

Despite a dip in investor mindshare in 2025 as Sui and Solana gained attention, TON’s Telegram-native advantages such as mini-apps, wallet integration, and real-world utility position it for broader adoption in 2026 and beyond. While price may feel sluggish short-term, on-chain activity, ecosystem builds, and utility adoption suggest a quietly resilient network.

The question now is whether TON’s infrastructure-focused growth can translate into renewed price momentum and how DeFi and AI integrations will shape the ecosystem in the coming months.

What are your thoughts? Do you see TON as quietly stacking for the long term or is there a breakout waiting once adoption and utility catch wider attention? Share your view and let’s discuss where TON could head next.",1,1765833530.0,TonDiscussion,0,1.0,False
1pnjas3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiangirlsontinder/comments/1pnjas3/how_to_increase_your_number_of_matches_men/,How to increase your number of matches (men),"Since a whole lot of you DM’d me asking how I get “interesting” matches lol, here are a few pointers you can use to level up your dating profile

NOTE: This is for people actually looking to date. Not hookups, flings, or casual shizz. Also let’s be honest: the first swipe is heavily dependent on how you look. People are biased towards attractive people. That’s just how the world works. Dating apps are visual, and people swipe on those they’re sexually attracted to. HOWEVER, there are a few things you can do to improve your profile:

1. The cover photo - This will make or break your experience because you really only have about 0.5-1 second to grab her attention before she swipes left. To land a match, your cover photo needs two key things. Firstly, she should be able to clearly see what you look like (no side face, no half-covered face, no group pics, no sunglasses, no shirtless mirror shots). Second, she should be able to imagine herself on a date with you. Think: front-facing, casual clothes, maybe at a cafe with a coffee in hand. Clean, approachable, and not lewd

2. The thirst trap (but done right) - Don’t confuse a thirst trap with something cheesy or raunchy. No gym selfies or bodybuilding poses. Keep it subtle and effortless: shirtless on your balcony, shirtless while sitting casually on a chair, or shirtless at the beach/pool. If you don’t wanna do ang pradarshan, that’s totally fine. A smiling candid works just as well. Honestly, sometimes better. Just make sure the smile is genuine and not forced or staged

3. Chill outfit in your car - Give a little side profile (like a 3/4th angle), clicked either during golden hour or in dim lighting (but not too dark). Your face should still be clearly visible, and you shouldn’t look like Kaaliya Daaku on a heist

4. A selfie - This is a controversial take because many people don’t recommend selfies, BUT it’s actually very rare for guys to click a fun selfie with a slightly goofy (but not cringe or overdone) expression. Think: slightly furrowed eyebrows with a relaxed grin. This works best for me. Idk why but it does

5. Doing an activity - This is where you show your personality. Here you add a slightly posed pic of you doing something. Pottery, painting, cooking, even holding a book (please don’t pose dramatically with it). The point is to visually show a hobby without screaming LOOK I HAVE HOBBIES. You like cricket? Then lean against a wall with a bat, or hold a ball and smile. Personally, my “doing an activity” pic is me building a snowman, and it performs really well in terms of likes and matches 

6. Semi-formal restaurant pic - Classic, clean, and timeless. Doesn’t need explanation

PLEASE lose the trope of posing with a dog, putting up group pics, or half-covered faces. Lastly, I’m not claiming this is the only way to get matches. It’s all subjective. These things just worked for me

PS: This post only gives pointers on how to get a match. What you do after that depends on your social and conversational skills. And if you ask me, never chase or try too hard to keep a conversation going. It’s honestly not worth wasting your time, energy, or cerebral capacity on someone who dry texts or gives terse replies

Growing pretty steady and taking on larger projects every year. 

I've always dreamed of the day I could open a physical location to call my own, work, and of course make money from. I browse local real estate listings and plan things in my head, but when crunching napkin numbers, feel like it could never make sense. $5-6k in rent alone is sorta doable but scary as I've never had experience in renting/owning a physical business location before. The going rate for a full-day of studio space in Dallas-Fort Worth is about $1k a day. 8 full day rentals a month sounds doable to break even, I think. 

To those who ran or are currently operating studio spaces, how do you make it work? What are some common pitfalls? Did you diversify your revenue stream? How did you include it into your existing business needs?

1pnja6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pnja6w/theres_something_wrong_with_the_wickenshire_house/,There's something wrong with the Wickenshire House.,"The blaring of my cellphone jolted me awake, and I sat up with a groan.

*Getting too old for this.*

In front of my ragged couch, the TV continued with its black and white parade of old footage from a World War One documentary, though the war seemed nearly over now. Judging by the digital clock on the mantelpiece, which read 3:49 AM, I’d been asleep for at least five hours. My body ached, a familiar problem at my age, but enough that I chided myself for not going to bed earlier like a responsible person. It had been a long day, so I came home to a cold shower, a few hot dogs warmed in the microwave and settled down to watch some television before bed. Of course, at 55 years old I’d misjudged how tired I really was and spent close to half the night slumped on my sofa, which meant I would be paying for it in the morning with stiff joints and a sore back.

Palming my cracked Motorola from the coffee table, I found the TV remote and hit the *mute* button as I answered the call. “Hello?”

Shaky breathing grated on the other end, and after a few moments, a girl’s hushed voice whispered through. “Mr. Todd?”

Ice rippled through my veins at the sound of Cindy’s panicked voice, and I sat up straighter to rub at my bleary eyes. “Yeah, I’m here. You okay? What’s wrong?”

Silence greeted me, a strange mix of static, trembling breaths, and what sounded like sniffles as she tried to hold back tears. “Please . . . help me.”

“Cindy?” Concern building in my mind, I switched on a nearby lamp and pulled myself from the couch with a grunt at the tightness in my lower back. “You there? What’s going on?”

More shaky gasps followed, and just over the static, I thought I heard the faint sound of melodic humming in the background.

“Something’s wrong.” Cindy whispered, her words so quiet that they made each breath sound like cannon fire. “T-The woods are . . . something fell out of the sky and . . . it was so loud, it woke me up. There’s a fire.”

Brow furrowed, I moved fast for the kitchen, stumbling through the dark interior of my little cabin to grope for the light switch. “Stay calm, just stay calm and talk to me. You said there’s a fire? How far away? Can you get to your car?”

Another sniffle came through, clogged with harsh interference as the signal weakened, a sound that made my veins throb with tension. “I-I can’t. Something’s here, it’s in the house, it’s *in the house with me*. W-We can’t get out.”

My throat tried to close up, and I gulped hard against a wave of nausea. “Someone broke in? Are you hurt? Where’s Erin?”

A long pause, and in the background of the mute static, I could have sworn the humming sound cut out, as though whoever it was stopped their eerie melody all at once.

“She’s gone.” Something in Cindy’s tone changed, as if the fear drained away to a blank emotionless rasp, and the line went dead with a chilling *click.*

Every inch of my body racked with a shiver, and both feet seemed glued to the floor in a strange form of dread.

Like so many girls before them, Cindy Fadro and Erin Martinelli had been hired on to be caretakers and actors in the Wickenshire Living History Estate. Erin was 19, studying to be a nurse, while Cindy had just graduated high school and wanted to be a teacher. They were good kids, calm, intelligent, and great workers. Though I never had any children, they were like daughters of my own, and they even baked a cake for my birthday in June. Once they called me in for a leaky pipe, but only after they had done their best to fix it themselves with a tool kit I’d left in the stairwell cupboard. Smart little troopers that they were, the girls even had the common sense to shut the correct valve off and found the leak on their own. Had it been anyone else, I might have considered this to be a prank, a joke, some dumb idea made by bored kids to get a new video for their social media nonsense, but I knew Cindy and Erin.

They didn’t pull pranks like this.

Unnerved, I tried to redial her number but got no answer. Erin’s number yielded the same result, and I shook my head at myself.

*Screw it, I’m not taking any chances.*

I was midway through yanking my work boots on when the sheriff picked up.

*“Hello?”*

From the gruffness in his words, I could tell he’d been asleep as well, but I couldn’t waste time with the standard 911 procedures.

“David, it’s me.” I cinched down the laces on my boots and grabbed my Carhart jacket from its hook by the door. “Cindy just called from the Wickenshire place. There’s a fire on the mountain, and I think someone’s broken into the house. I’m headed there now.”

Rustling on the opposite end of the phone let me know David was up, likely going through the same motions as myself. The son of a Polish man and a Kootenai woman, David Kowolski and I had known each other since high school, and even played football on the same team. Nicknamed ‘White Cloud’ for his European features and Native American blood, he was stubborn with a quick temper, but tenacious when it came to his job. As a law man he drove his deputies relentlessly, backed them to the hilt when it came to any court battles, and as a result he’d managed to keep the crime in Jacob’s Fork quite low over the years. We didn’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I knew I could count on him when it came to something like this. If Cindy or Erin were in danger, Sheriff Kowolski would ride through hell and back to get them out, which was exactly the kind of man I needed right now.

*“I’ll get on the horn to a few of my boys and have them meet you there.”* He replied, and I heard the zipping of a coat on his end, along with the metallic *cha-click* of a handgun slide being racked. *“Fire teams are going to need time to get spun up, so whatever happens, don’t go wandering off without letting me know. Last thing I want is us getting caught in the flames if they decide to move down the mountain.”*

I nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see me and kept the phone pressed to my ear as I swiped my truck keys from the porcelain ashtray near the front door. “Got it.”

*“Be careful, Andy.”* His voice hitched in a low pause, as if the sheriff himself had as bad a feeling about this as I did, and he hung up.

Rain pattered on the windshield of my ancient pickup truck as I wound my way through the dark backroads of northern Idaho, the night sky black with the clouds of late fall. On the sun-faded seat next to me lay my work kit; a simple heavy duty canvas tool bag that held various tools, keys, a flashlight, and an old revolver handed down to me from my grandfather. I used the tools in my job every day as the groundskeeper, janitor, and fix-it-all handyman for the Wickenshire House, which had been part of our small town for as long as anyone could remember. Set on a picturesque 103 acres of fields and woodland in the shadow of the nearby Smoke Point Mountain, the Wickenshire House was a rare example of eastern architecture in the far reaches of the American West. It was the property of our town’s oldest resident, Mr. Edward J. Watkins, a kindly if forgetful soul who’d seen 91 years on this earth and still could drive his own car, though he had a little trouble with stairs. He lived in a cottage on the western edge of town, but I wasn’t about to call him at this time of night, even for something so urgent. Knowing Ed Watkins, he would try to drive out to the house with his slippers on and get hurt stumbling around in the flames.

*Or run into whatever scumbag is in the house, God forbid.*

On the horizon, some of the clouds began to glow, an orange flicker that widened on the mountainside as the distant fire spread. I could barely glimpse an odd plume of smoke in the sky, not curved upward from the fire but downward in a long arc, backlit by the flames. Looking at it, I had a momentary lapse of courage, my resolve wavering. Cindy had said something ‘fell from the sky’. This looked like a trail of some kind, maybe a crashed plane or a fallen weather balloon. If there was jet fuel on the ground, the fire would be even worse to put out than usual. It was horrible, rotten luck all the way around; a wildfire on the same night the house had its first break in, while the girls were there alone.

Adrenaline pumping, I sped up the lonely gravel trail to the house, one of the final sections of public roadways that got this close to the mountain. The Wickenshire House reared from the gloom ahead, its tall gates and Victorian gables illuminated by the dual halos of my truck’s headlights. It still took my breath away, the ornate beauty of the place, built as if every stone had been placed by a perfectionist’s hand. It stood at two stories in height, built from stone mined at the local quarry, with multiple chimneys, a balcony overlooking the back garden, and a grand front porch that wrapped halfway around the entire structure. A stone wall encircled the main grounds, with a wrought iron gate at the drive and several ornamental gardens interspersed throughout. Plush lawns stretched in between, and there were a few oak trees planted there for their brilliant colors in the fall. A small garage had been built around the back of the house sometime in the 1960’s, but this mainly held the riding lawnmower and a small shop where I did most of my repair work. Cindy and Erins’ cars were parked back there, the front gravel lot reserved for visitors during the daily tours. I didn’t see any other vehicle that the intruder might have used, but something else caught my attention in that moment, and held it with a pull like gravity.

*Lord have mercy.*

I stared, slack jawed, at a huge sea of flames that roared through the nearby trees with a voracious appetite. The fire hadn’t wasted any time, chewing through the wet growth as if the rain had never fell, evergreens crackling as they burned to dust in minutes. The heat came through my windshield in a steady increase, warm enough that I couldn’t tell the difference between the fire and my truck heater. The open grassy slopes around the house were consumed as the flames inched closer to the building, and fire closed in from both east and west.

Bounding from my truck, I dashed up to the front door and pulled the handles.

The polished brass knobs rattled but didn’t turn, the flames licking their way across the prairie grass outside the ornate courtyard walls.

*Locked. That means our scumbag didn’t break in through here. Maybe he went around the back?*

With shaking hands, I put down the canvas tool bag and dug in it for my key ring.

Sirens began to wail in the distance, and I finally managed to force the doors open, leaving the keys in the lock to snatch my aged pistol.

“Cindy!” I produced a flashlight with my left hand to hold it beneath my gun, and swept the beam of it over the murky interior. “Erin! Where are you?”

I’d been in the house countless times over the years, but in that moment it felt suffocating, like a great stony maw waiting for me to go far enough in so as to swallow me whole. The foyer led to a large room with a grand staircase, doorways on either side opening to the main dining room and a sitting room respectively. Signs and velvet ropes were posted to guide visitors through the proper areas, a gift shop in the rear of the house near the old parlor, along with guest bathrooms added on to the original back porch. With all the lights off, it looked alien, surreal for this part of the country with its eastern Victorian mystique, and my skin prickled at the sensation that there were eyes in every shadow. Of course, I had been stupid to yell. I’d let my panic get the better of me, and now I had given away the element of surprise. If some creep was in the house somewhere with Erin or Cindy, doing God-knows-what, I wouldn’t be able to sneak up on him now.

*Alright then, might as well move fast.*

With the old revolver grasped in my trembling hands, I headed for the stairs and took them three at a time. The wood creaked under my steps, ancient chestnut and oak that had been sawn before the Great Depression, each footfall like a cannon in the silent house. From here, the roar of the fire outside seemed a muffled whisper, as though there were two different realities, and the house stood guard between them. However, I remembered the heat coming through the windshield of my pickup and knew I didn’t have much time. Soon the house would be in flames, the fire outside enough to melt glass and ignite the wooden siding in minutes.

I reached the top of the stairs and swept my flashlight beam down both ends of the corridor at the top, uncertain of which direction to go first. Cindy and Erin were roomed down the hall to the left, but if someone had indeed broken into the house, Cindy might have hid somewhere else. Every second wasted could mean life or death, and I realized that either way, I’d be turning my back to the unknown.

Something flickered in the beam of my light, a brief whisp of shadow that jerked back behind the far corner of the right-side hallway. I didn’t have more than a moment to see clear details, but there was enough of an image burned into my mind that it came to me in a cold rush.

A face.

*Kowolski, you’d better get here soon.*

Swallowing, I paced down the hallway, my handgun leveled on the spot where the shadow had been.

Upon reaching it, I inched in a wide arc around the corner, bracing for a figure to jump out at me.

The air caught in my throat, and I stared at a section of wallpaper bathed in the aura of my flashlight.

Brownish-black sludge had been daubed on the wall, smeared into a perfect circle so that the excess dripped over the wallpaper like ebony tears. I couldn’t tell if it was mud, blood, or something else, but the corridor stank of rot and the putrid scent of stagnant water. Thorny bits of twig had been woven together, tied here and there with bits of plant fiber to form a circle that overlaid the sludge. Pasted together on the wall, these seemed to make up a protective ring, and in the middle were the handprints.

From what I could see, they were two different sizes, slender fingers and narrow palms indicating two younger females. Both prints faced downwards, slightly overlapping each other at the heel of the palm, and the thumbs arced toward one another like pincers. Unlike the grimy sludge, these were pressed to the old wallpaper in an unmistakable red hue, and it hit me what I was looking at.

*A spider.*

The four fingers of each hand made the legs, the thumbs its mandibles. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the blackness of the outer paste came from petals . . . rose petals to be exact. There were no roses growing in Idaho this time of year, and I’d never seen a natural black rose in my life, yet these appeared fresh. Most had been ground to a powder that gave the foul substance its dark color, others pushed into the muck like decorative flair, giving a strange, heady undertone to the mixture. With this discovery came more clarity; the thorny twigs glued into the circle were not random. They spread inward toward the spider, forming a sharp web of spikes that enshrined it, with the careful touch of an artisan. Such a display would have taken hours to make, certainly longer than the time it took for Cindy to call me. How was this possible?

*“Mr. Todd!”*

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the horrific cry echoing from somewhere behind me, Cindy’s voice tinged in pain and fear.

No sooner had I turned, running a short distance back toward the main corridor at the top of the stairs, and the voice cut out with a high, agonized scream.

“Cindy!” I charged toward the girls’ rooms, heart pounding in my chest.

*“Help me!”* Back in the direction of the symbol, Erin’s voice rang out, choked with sobs and full of torment. *“Mr. Todd, please!”*

Acidic bewilderment slithered through my mind, and I skidded to a stop, caught in the middle of the hallway, the staircase just to my left. I had been so close, perhaps a door away from Erin only moments ago. Could there be more than one intruder holding the girls in separate rooms?

*Cindy is closest. I have to get to her. She sounds like she’s hurt.*

Teeth gritted against the screams of Erin, I forced myself through the left side hallway, her voice ringing in my ears as she begged for my help.

At the end of the hall, I reached the rooms given to the girls and lunged for the handle to Cindy’s.

It didn’t turn, locked from the inside.

Backing up, I drove the heel of my boot into the door next to the lock and heard the old wood splinter. Any other time, I would have balked at such destruction, these doors being over 80 years old, but it didn’t matter anymore. What the fire didn’t get would not be worth Cindy or Erin’s lives.

The door swung open to slap against the bedroom wall, and I dashed inside, revolver in hand.

*What the . . .*

Within the quiet interior of the bedroom, everything looked untouched, the curtains partially open, the bed rumpled from where Cindy had gotten up to check the window, a discarded work uniform in the clothes hamper by the door. Dark stained wood trim lined the walls, windows, and doorway, the walls papered with a robin egg blue pattern that gave it an airy feeling. The white lacy curtains wafted like clouds in the slight draft that came in the open hallway door, and the vintage hot water heater gurgled in the corner as steam worked its way through the pipes. There were modern touches as well, more lamps and lights plugged into the discreet electrical outlets in the walls, a small television on its stand across from the bed, and a side door opened to a shared bathroom between Cindy’s room and Erin’s. This room wasn’t open to tourists, as it was the private living quarters for our workers, so such things were permissible here, as opposed to other parts of the house. Nothing seemed out of place, but there was no sign of Cindy anywhere, no clues to indicate that she’d been there moments ago. It was as if she’d gotten out of bed, looked out the window, and vanished into thin air.

In a flurry of movement, I checked under the bed, in the closet, and the bathroom. When those came back clean, I broke through the bathroom door into Erin’s room, only to find more of the same.

There was no sign of the girls anywhere.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* Erin’s screams continued from the opposite end of the long corridor, and I flung open the bedroom door to retrace my mad dash in her direction, confusion and frustration mounting.

Rounding the corner that bore the strange mark on the wall, I swayed to a stop on the old floorboards next to the door where her screams had come from and yanked on the knob.

*You’ve got to be kidding me . . . how many doors did they lock before I got here?*

With a gasp of exertion, I backed up to kick the door in like the last one, muscles tensed for the effort.

*“Mr. Todd!”* Cindy’s cries exploded from the doorway behind me, rabid and intense as the door rattles on its hinges like she was throwing herself against it from within the room.

I froze, staring at the door, heart racing as my mind whirled. How could she be in there? I’d heard Cindy on the other side of the house not five minutes ago. There was no way she could have moved that fast, not without going past me. I would have seen her in the hall, would have heard the ancient doors creaking on their hinges as they opened.

She couldn’t be in there.

*“Please, help me!”* Erin’s screams started up again, but this time from somewhere in the left-side hallway, and another door began to groan in muted *thuds* as if she too were trying to break it down.

A dry fear crept into my throat, different than what I’d known coming into the house. This didn’t make sense. Erin’s voice had been coming from the door I stood ready to break into, but now it was to my left. Cindy’s had been coming from her room in the west wing but now called from the door behind me. Neither could have left their respective rooms without entering the hall, and I knew for a fact that there weren’t any old-fashioned servant entrances anywhere that could have let them move unnoticed. Something was wrong, very wrong.

Shaken, I took a step away from the door that echoed with Cindy’s voice. “Cindy?”

*“Mr. Todd!”* She begged from the other side of the oak planking, the wood slamming against the jam with wild urgency. *“Please, help me! Please!”*

“The door is locked.” I tried not to hyperventilate as I watched the knob rattle in its socket, knowing fully well the lock was on her side of the door. “Can you let me in?”

Her wails increased in pitch, the screeches an awful combination of agony and terror that made my stomach churn. It sounded as if Cindy was being tormented in the worst ways imaginable, but something about the cadence of each shriek felt off, enough that my brain sent up warning alarms inside my skull.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* She pleaded once more, the same words both girls kept using in various rearrangements over and over, the door shuddering under each blow she made.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I sucked in a breath, eyes focused on the doorknob as it clacked back-and-forth, like Cindy wanted to open it but couldn’t. An uncanny thought rose in my mind, bone-chilling in its clarity, growing louder and louder so that it burst from me before I could stop it.

“Cindy,” I gripped my flashlight so hard that my knuckles turned white. “What’s my first name?”

Like a thunderclap, Cindy’s pleas ceased, along with Erin’s, so that the entire house fell into dead silence. Nothing moved, and even the muffled roar of the wildfire outside seemed deadened further than before, as though the house was a vacuum of sound. My skin crawled, the air thick in my lungs, and a strange certainty took hold of me that made the sense of dread even worse as Cindy’s words about Erin trickled through my brain.

*She’s gone.*

*Click.*

To my right, a doorknob at the far end of the hallway unlocked.

*Click.*

Another lock slid open, this one closer, the doors remaining shut as more joined them one-by-one.

*Click.*

*Click.*

*Click.*

A twinge of panic tightened in my throat, but I leveled the beam of my flashlight at the first door that had unlocked, blood surging in my temples. Everything seemed loud, the heartbeat in my chest, the breath in my lungs, the groan of the floorboards under my boots. My vision narrowed, a vibration hummed to life inside my skull, and I tasted metal on my tongue. In my hand, the flashlight began to flicker as if the batteries were struggling to remain lit, and I couldn’t lift the revolver, my arms refusing to move like the gun weighed as much as a car.

The locks carried on past me, every door on the second story unlocking itself in a continuous march, until at last, the final *click* resounded from the far hallway like cannon fire to my ears.

For a moment, the silence returned, so thick it may as well have been water.

*Wham.*

Every door on the second story flung open, impacting against the wall inside their respective rooms so hard that I heard plaster *crunch*, the hinges squealing on old dust.

With them came the screams.

There were hundreds of voices, some human, others less so, bellowing at the top of their lungs to be heard over one another. If they were saying any words, they were lost among the throng, a constant roar of vocals that soured in my ears for the sheer volume of it. Somewhere among the morass, I could barely catch the sound of Erin and Cindy’s voices shrieking with the others, a morbid choir of pain, suffering, and fear. It seemed to seep out of the floorboards, ooze from the heater vents, and rebound off the walls in every direction. With the doors open, the deep orange glow of the flames outside poured into the house like a tidal wave, but oddly enough no heat came with it, the hallway as cold as if I’d stepped into a freezer. The shadows elongated in the firelight, swaying as they inched up the papered walls, and a pungent smell followed them.

Roses.

It came with overpowering strength, sickly-sweet, but unmistakable. As the tide of shadows advanced down the hall toward me, the fermented stink of roses filled the air like poison gas, and I tasted copper on my lips.

*I have to get out of here.*

Coughing on the blood running from both nostrils, I stumbled toward the stairs, my head a mess of static. Like a tide of slithering vines, the inky shadows pursued me with ravenous hunger. I could feel their magnetic pull, the chorus of screams still ringing across the house with deafening volume, a terrible siren song that tugged at something deep within my subconscious. Voices, so many voices, begged me to stay, to go back, to find the darkest room and sink myself into the abyss until it drowned me.

Something tightened on my ankle just as I reached the top of the staircase, and I toppled headlong down the steps.

*Bam.*

My hip rammed into a banister, and I lost my grip on the pistol.

*Wham.*

Another step hit my shoulder, and I felt my teeth bite into my tongue, the flashlight clattering away into the floor below.

*Smack.*

My head connected with the floorboards at the landing, and the blackness threatened to close over my eyes for the last time.

*Creak.*

One of the steps flexed under the weight of a foot, and I gulped air in pain to squint at the shadows.

*Creak.*

Another footstep echoed toward me, something at the top of the steps descending with a slow, methodical gait. It didn’t sound heavy, not the deft pace of a large man or thick boot, but almost delicate, light, graceful. Yet, there was something about each carefully placed step, each sigh and squeak of the aged woodwork that made my skin wriggle. Something was coming, something that knew exactly where I was even in the pitch blackness of the house.

It was watching me, *stalking* me through the shadows like a cat with a mouse.

Desperate fear surged in my brain, and I clawed through the dark on my stomach to find a way out. I last remembered the front door being nearby, but it seemed to take an eternity to move across the cold floorboards, the unseen presence mere yards behind me as I wriggled forward.

At last, I managed to gain my footing, though it hurt to put weight on my right leg, and hurled myself forward in the blind shadows.

*Thud.*

Both front doors flew open, and I tumbled out onto the porch, rolling down the steps into the stones of the walkway.

Like a switch had been thrown, the world seemed to come alive once more, the cold sensation fading, the sound returning. Sirens wailed closer as headlights appeared in the long gravel driveway, and the crackle of flames roared from the trees. Smoke filled my nostrils, heat from the nearby fire licked over my skin, and I rolled onto my side to look back toward the house.

My lungs tightened, and I stared, unable to pull my eyes away.

Inside the open front doorway, nothing was visible, not the glint of firelight from inside, nor the faint glow of it coming through any ground windows. The entrance was a mass of impenetrable shadows that seemed to form a solid wall at the threshold, yet deep within that abyss, something stared back.

It had no shape, no form that I could identify it with, but there was definitely a presence that stood just beyond the light, watching me from the gloom. My eyes seemed fastened to it, either by my own primordial fear, or perhaps willed so by whatever peered out of the wretched expanse. A torrent of emotions ripped through my mind, warped and misshapen, like cold fingers pried at the taps of my humanity to unleash a maelstrom of feeling. Hunger and fear. Hate and despair. Lust and sadness. Grief and pain. They all rolled over one another, tumbling in and out of each other in a never-ending tide, and it hit me with a strangled form of clarity that these weren’t *my* emotions.

Locked in place by the unknown being’s gaze, I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as cry out, my only option to fight back with what little expression I had left.

*What are you?*

Something about my terrified thought seemed to strike a chord within the cascade of terrible shadow, for the next instant the doors on the house creaked in their wrought-iron hinges, and then swung shut on their own.

The rest of the night was a blur, a stupor, one that I wandered through in a mindless fog. Firefighting crews appeared from miles around to help put out the blaze, but not before it chewed through all 103 acres on the Wickenshire estate. Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was burned to cinders. Even boulders cracked from the intense heat, the smoke pall so large it could be seen from Montana, or so I heard. One of the fire trucks exploded when its fuel tank caught fire and killed three men. Everything burned . . . except the house.

For some reason, the fire stopped at the stone courtyard walls and went no further. In a blaze hot enough that it had turned some minor sandpits on the mountain to crude glass, there wasn’t so much as a scorch mark on the house or its outbuildings. None of the paint peeled, the siding wasn’t so much as warm to the touch, and all the plants withing the yard were unscathed. The investigators couldn’t even find ash on the roof from the fire afterwards, not a single flake. Unlike its ruined acreage, the Wickenshire House had survived the wildfire unharmed, and no one could make any sense of it.

Once the fire was finally put out, they took me to the local clinic for my injuries, a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and a concussion from my tumble down the stairs. Sheriff Kowolski visited in the morning to see how I was, and to fill me in on what I’d missed once they trucked me away from the site.

Over three hundred search and rescue volunteers had been called out, along with special forensics teams from neighboring counties, and they hadn’t found any sign of Cindy Fadro or Erin Martinelli. The last time they managed to ping Cindy’s phone via satellite, it had registered a mile up the slope from the house, but they never managed to recover the device. Tracking dogs refused to go near the house and seemed to lose all scent once they left the property boundaries. No trace of Erin was discovered, and no DNA could be found in either of the girls’ rooms to point to a culprit. One of the searchers claimed he had heard what sounded like a female voice screaming for help on the northern slope, but he wasn’t sure where it had come from, and no one else could verify it. Another man claimed he saw someone walking inside the tree line near the eastern edge of the property but never got a good glimpse at their face to see who they were. With all speculation bereft of evidence, it seemed to everyone that both Cindy and Erin had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Worse yet, when I described my account to the sheriff, he informed me that his team hadn’t found any symbols painted on the walls, nor did they see anything out of the ordinary. All they found that aligned with my story was the strange, overwhelming aroma of roses that permeated the house.

Nothing more.

That was six weeks ago. I got out of the clinic within a few days after the event, but the continued search efforts proved fruitless. With their investigation coming up cold, the sheriff’s office released the house back to Mr. Watkins, who closed it indefinitely. I had never seen him so distraught in my life, as Ed took the girls’ disappearance rather hard. He felt personally responsible, though we all knew there wasn’t anything he could have done, especially since no one knew what happened to Erin or Cindy. However, Ed apparently decided to go there himself late one evening to do some looking around the house and didn’t bother to tell anyone else. It wasn’t until his cleaning lady stopped by his cottage in Jacob’s Fork the next morning that Ed was reported missing, and police dispatched to the Wickenshire House.

They never found him.

His car was parked out front, the doors unlocked, but they couldn’t find a trace of Edward Watkins anywhere on the property. I helped with the search, as I basically slept in the sheriff’s office these days, and found no sign of a struggle or any other foul play, only the smell of roses. We dug deep this time, rifled through local records, archives, property history, everything we could get our hands on about the estate. There was nothing to indicate this place would be trouble, no forgotten building plans with hidden rooms, no land disputes with older tenants, no tribal issues from burial grounds or holy sites. The property was normal, and even when I poked around to see if there had been any deaths, suicides, or other sordid affairs associated with the house, my search came up blank. There was no reason for this to be happen, not from human effort, or anything else.

Even now, as December drags on, nothing has been the same. No plants grow in the burned zone, not even the smallest patch of liken or moss, as if the ground is poisoned to its core. Animals avoid it, so that the uncharred sections of forest around the property are empty, silent places. The access road is chained off to keep curious locals away, and Sheriff Kowolski let me bunk at a small ranger cabin at the base of the mountain just so I could keep tabs on the place. I think he knew I needed to be close, to keep an eye on the house, and keep looking for answers. I can’t explain why, but I know something is in there, waiting, biding its time. It failed to get me that night, but I have a terrible premonition that it doesn’t need *me*.

It just needs *more*.

I’ve found markers in the last few days. Piles of bones. Not haphazard from an animal kill, but stacked, organized, purposeful. Bits of twine made from plant fibers hold them together, and despite being in the open, no animals will bother them, not even the vultures. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, they think I can’t process the girls being gone, but I’ve stumbled on over a dozen of them now. They seemed to be set in a wide ring around the property line, spanning outward from the house into the forest beyond, capturing more territory by the day. No matter how many times I remove them, the piles always reappear, with fresh bones added to the stacks. I don’t touch them anymore, and I don’t even make eye contact with the empty eye sockets of the skulls. The few times I have, I heard whispers in my sleep, and had nightmares of eyes in the shadows of my room.

Some of the bones are like those of a rabbit or mole, while others are bigger like elk or bear. Every pile is topped with a skull, most of them from small game, but five of the piles hold unique skulls; a bear, a coyote, an eagle, a snake, and lastly, a great bull elk. They are laid out opposite one another ringing the house, the rest of the smaller markers ranging from them into the forest beyond. Of all the markers, the one with the elk skull is tallest, its full spread of antlers still intact so that it is nine feet high at the eye sockets. I found a symbol painted onto the bone forehead with powdered charcoal that the rain never seems to wash away, no matter how many times I go up to it.

A spider.

One made of two slender, inverted hands, both the same size.

I’m posting this so that it’s on record, in case one of these days I don’t come back from that mountain. Service was always spotty up there before, but ever since that night, it’s been non-existent. Even the few trail cameras I’ve put out have either gone dead or produced nothing but blurry photos. Something is building these markers, watching me whenever I walk the perimeter, and shifting in the corners of my vision whenever I turn my head. I’ve discovered trail signs that have been purposefully moved to misdirect me. Sometimes I hear screams in the woods, distant and warped, but they sound like Erin’s cries. I see flashes of blonde hair in the bushes that I want to believe is Cindy, but I know it can’t be.

They’re gone, both of them.

Only the sheriff understands, even if he doesn’t say much to that effect. I can see it in his eyes, he knows that I’m telling the truth, and his own deputies have been up to the house to see the piles multiple times. There’s nothing they can do, nothing but wait from the valley below and hope that the snow buries whatever it is for the winter.

There’s something wrong with the Wickenshire House, something *inside* it, something unseen that walks the grounds day and night. It wants more than the estate, I can feel it, can taste it in the wind, hear it in the dry crunch of snow under my boots, and feel it in the shivers I get every time I look at the dark, barren windows of that cursed structure.

It wants the forest, the trees, the mountain.

It wants *everything*.",1,1765833476.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for suggestions on how to survive (and hopefully enjoy) the holiday season in Toronto as a single guy with no family here.

For context, I’m a 26M software engineer working in big tech. I have time off from Dec 20 to Jan 2. I’ve traveled to 4 different cities in the last month, so I’m burnt out on travel and just want to stay put in Toronto. However, all my friends are out of town for the holidays, so I’m finding myself stuck in the city alone.

To be honest, I had a bit of a rough year personally and got hurt by someone close to me recently. Usually, I’m a pretty happy on my own, I love my alone time, playing guitar, reading non-fiction, working on side projects, and watching documentaries and cool videos on youtube. My friends describe me as a ""cool nerd.""

But with the holidays coming up and the weather being so cold (my first winter here!), the idea of spending 10 days completely isolated in my apartment downtown is starting to feel pretty depressing.

I’ve done the solo travel thing a lot (been to 10+ countries), but I’m tired of doing things alone right now. I have been single for last 2 years and I have tried the apps. I get matches and go on dates, so that isn't really the issue, but right now I am not specifically asking for just a holiday date or anything thats why I am posting here!

I’m looking for:

1.	⁠Recommendations: What can I do in the city during these dates that isn't just ""walking around alone""? Are there specific events, workshops, or social spots that are welcoming to solos during the holidays?
2.	⁠Company: If there’s anyone else in the same boat (guy or girl, doesn't matter) who is stuck in the city and wants to grab a coffee, catch a movie in theatre, or explore a Christmas market, let me know.

I’m easygoing, educated, and just looking to keep my mind off things and make the most of the break.

Thanks in advance for any tips!",12,1765833320.0,askTO,12,0.88,False

1pnj3ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralGerontology/comments/1pnj3ov/my_parent_with_dementia_keeps_asking_the_same/,My parent with dementia keeps asking the same question 50 times in an hour. How do I stop this loop without losing my mind?,"This repetitive questioning is perhaps the single most maddening and exhausting symptom for any caregiver. You feel like you're losing your mind, trapped in a loop of answering the same question until the sound of your own voice makes you want to scream.

You feel frustrated because you think you're failing to communicate the answer. The hard truth is, the answer is already gone the moment they ask the question. The short-term memory part of the brain is broken. You are dealing with a faulty CD skipping on the same track.

The secret to managing this isn't in your answer; **it's in your approach.** You can’t stop the question from being asked, but you can change how you respond to restore your sanity and bring calm to the moment.

The ""Three Response"" Strategy to Break the Loop

Instead of trying to force the answer into a broken memory bank, use these three behavioral responses:

1. Validate the Emotion, Not the Fact

The question often isn't about the *answer*; it’s about an underlying feeling (anxiety, loneliness, need for security).

* **Instead of:** Repeating the time of the appointment for the 10th time.
* **Try:** Acknowledging the anxiety: ""You seem really worried about the doctor appointment. I know you're busy.""
* **Why it works:** You address the root cause of the distress.

2. The Power of Redirection and Distraction (The Pivot)

This is your most powerful tool. Acknowledge the question briefly, then immediately redirect their focus to something else entirely.

* **Instead of:** ""As I just said, the appointment is at 3 PM.""
* **Try:** Acknowledging and pivoting: ""The appointment is all handled. Hey, I just made fresh coffee/tea/cookies. Want some?"" or ""Look at this picture of the grandkids!""
* **Why it works:** You shift the brain's focus entirely, short-circuiting the loop of the same thought pattern.

3. Use an External, Non-Verbal Cue (The ""Cheat Sheet"")

Remove yourself as the source of the answer to preserve your relationship and sanity.

* **Instead of:** Answering the question verbally every time.
* **Try:** Writing the answer on a large whiteboard or a Post-it note and pointing to it calmly. ""Here is the time written down for you."" You might have to point 50 times, but you aren't saying the words out loud, which reduces your frustration.
* **Why it works:** The consistent visual cue is often easier to process than a verbal answer, and it preserves your energy.

Remember the mantra: The person isn't giving you a hard time; they are *having* a hard time. Use these tools to give yourself a break, breathe, and find peace in the moment.

This is probably the most common question I get, and it's one of the hardest to answer. There's no crystal ball. Nobody — not your loan officer, not Wall Street analysts, not the Fed — knows exactly where rates will be tomorrow, next week, or next month.

But that doesn't mean you should just flip a coin. There's a framework for thinking through this decision that can help you make a more informed choice based on your specific situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

This post will give you that framework.

# Part 1: Understanding What You're Really Deciding

When you ""float"" your rate, you're making a bet that rates will improve before you need to lock. When you lock, you're paying for certainty.

**Floating means:**

* You have no guaranteed rate
* If rates improve, you benefit
* If rates worsen, you pay more (or scramble to lock at a worse rate)
* You're exposed to market risk until you lock

**Locking means:**

* Your rate is guaranteed for a specific period (typically 30, 45, or 60 days)
* If rates improve after you lock, you're stuck (unless you have a float-down option)
* If rates worsen after you lock, you're protected
* You've eliminated market risk

Neither choice is inherently ""right."" The best choice depends on your circumstances, timeline, and how much uncertainty you can tolerate.

# Part 2: The Asymmetry of Regret

Here's something most borrowers don't fully appreciate: **the downside of floating is often worse than the upside.**

Why? Because of how quickly rates can move against you versus how gradually they typically improve

https://preview.redd.it/ls57kmk6of7g1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f57b83c832a101a3466892c532aa6b2d3dbf74de

**Rates can spike fast:**

* A hot inflation report can push rates up 0.25% in a single day
* Geopolitical events can cause sudden moves
* A hawkish Fed comment can reverse a week of gains in hours
* Bond market selloffs can be violent and sudden

**Rates typically fall slowly:**

* Meaningful rate improvement usually requires sustained positive data
* Even when the trend is favorable, there are pullbacks along the way
* The market often ""prices in"" expected good news before it happens

This asymmetry means that floating for an extra 0.125% improvement exposes you to the risk of a 0.25-0.50% move against you. The risk/reward often isn't symmetric.

**Example:** You're offered 6.000% today. You think rates might drop to 5.875% if next week's inflation data is cool.

* **If you're right:** You save 0.125% on your rate. On a $400,000 loan, that's about $33/month or $396/year.
* **If you're wrong:** Inflation comes in hot, and rates spike to 6.250%. You're now paying 0.25% more than you would have. That's $67/month or $804/year — twice the potential savings.

And that's assuming you can even lock at 6.250%. In a fast-moving market, rates might gap higher before you can react.

# Part 3: Factors That Favor Locking

Consider locking sooner rather than later if:

# Your closing date is near (< 30 days)

The closer you are to closing, the less time you have to recover if rates move against you. A rate spike two days before closing leaves you with terrible options: accept the higher rate, delay closing (if even possible), or scramble to find alternative financing.

# You're at your budget limit

If the current rate already stretches your debt-to-income ratio or monthly budget, you can't afford to take on more risk. A rate increase could push you out of qualification entirely or into a payment you can't comfortably afford.

# Rate volatility is high

When markets are choppy — like around Fed meetings, inflation releases, or geopolitical uncertainty — the risk of sudden adverse moves increases. High volatility environments favor locking.

# The rate works for your financial goals

If the current rate allows you to hit your target payment, achieve your debt payoff timeline, or meet whatever financial objectives you have, lock it. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

# You're risk-averse by nature

Some people lose sleep over uncertainty. If floating will cause you stress and anxiety, that psychological cost matters. Peace of mind has value.

# You're buying in a competitive market

If you're in a bidding war or have contractual deadlines tied to your financing, you can't afford financing hiccups. Lock and remove the variable.

# You've already seen meaningful improvement

If rates have dropped 0.25-0.50% since you started your application, you've already benefited from favorable movement. Taking those gains off the table is often wise. Don't get greedy.

# Part 4: Factors That Favor Floating

Consider floating if:

# You have a long timeline (60+ days to closing)

More time means more opportunity for rates to improve and more ability to recover from temporary spikes. If you're locking 60 days out, you're paying for rate protection you may not need for most of that period.

# Technical indicators are strongly bullish

If you understand MBS charts (see my post on [How to Read an MBS Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/MortgageRates/comments/1piob6u/how_to_read_an_mbs_chart_understanding_the_data/)), and the technicals show strong momentum, oversold conditions, or a clear trend favoring improvement, floating has better odds.

*Caveat: Technicals can change quickly, and most borrowers don't have the expertise to read them accurately.*

# A specific catalyst is imminent

If there's an inflation report, jobs report, or Fed meeting in the next few days that has a reasonable chance of pushing rates lower, a short float might make sense.

*Caveat: These events can go either way. ""Waiting for the Fed meeting"" has burned many borrowers.*

# You have a float-down option

Some lenders offer a ""float-down"" provision that lets you lock now but reduce your rate if market rates improve by a certain threshold before closing. This gives you downside protection while preserving some upside. Float-downs typically cost 0.125-0.25% upfront or are built into a slightly higher initial rate.

# You have financial flexibility

If a rate increase of 0.25-0.375% wouldn't materially impact your qualification or budget, you have more room to take risk. Floating is more viable when the downside is tolerable.

# Current rates are clearly elevated due to temporary factors

Sometimes rates spike on news that the market will likely reassess. If there's a clear technical or fundamental reason to expect a reversal, floating through the volatility can work.

*Caveat: ""Clearly elevated"" is often only clear in hindsight.*

# Part 5: The Float-Down Option — Best of Both Worlds?

A float-down (also called a ""rate renegotiation"" or ""rate improvement"" option) lets you lock your rate now but take advantage of market improvements before closing.

**How it typically works:**

1. You lock at today's rate (e.g., 6.000%)
2. If rates drop by a specified threshold (often 0.250-.375%) before closing, you can ""float down"" to the lower rate
3. You usually get the improvement minus a small margin (e.g., if rates drop 0.375%, you might get 0.250% improvement)

**The catch:**

* The threshold for activation is often high enough that small improvements don't qualify
* Not all lenders offer them, and terms vary widely
* There may be timing restrictions (e.g., can only exercise within 15 days of closing)

**When float-downs make sense:**

* Longer lock periods (45-60+ days)
* Markets that seem poised for improvement but with uncertain timing
* Borrowers who want protection but hate the idea of missing a big rally
* Refinances with flexible closing timelines

**When they don't make sense:**

* Short lock periods where the fee isn't worth it
* Stable rate environments where big moves are unlikely
* Purchase transactions with tight deadlines

Ask your loan officer if they offer float-down provisions and what the specific terms are. The details matter.

# Part 6: The ""Lock and Monitor"" Strategy

Here's a middle-ground approach that many experienced borrowers use:

1. **Lock your rate** to eliminate risk and secure your financing
2. **Continue monitoring the market** after you lock
3. **If rates improve significantly**, ask your lender about options

**What options might exist?**

* Some lenders will renegotiate if rates drop substantially (0.375%+) and you ask nicely — especially if you're a strong borrower they want to keep
* You can sometimes cancel and restart with the same lender at current rates (though this may reset your timeline)
* In extreme cases, you could switch lenders entirely if the improvement is large enough to justify the cost and delay

**The key insight:** Locking doesn't mean you stop paying attention. It means you've secured a baseline while preserving the option to pursue improvements if the market moves dramatically in your favor.

This approach gives you the security of a lock with some potential upside, without the daily stress of being fully exposed to market moves.

# Part 7: What NOT to Do

# Don't float indefinitely waiting for the ""perfect"" rate

Rates may never hit your target. I've seen borrowers float for months waiting for 5.75% while rates bounced between 6.125% and 6.375%. Eventually they locked at 6.500% — higher than where they started.

# Don't make emotional decisions

A bad headline or one red day doesn't mean you should panic-lock. Conversely, one good day doesn't mean you should keep floating. Stick to your framework.

# Don't ignore your loan officer's input

Your LO watches the market daily and has seen how many floating strategies play out. They may have insights into lender-specific timing, reprice patterns, or upcoming changes. Listen to them (while remembering they also want to close your loan).

# Don't fixate on small increments

The difference between 6.000% and 6.125% on a $400,000 loan is about $33/month. That's real money, but it's not worth agonizing over for weeks or taking substantial risk. Keep perspective.

# Don't float if you can't handle the downside

If a rate increase would cause you to lose the house, blow your budget, or create serious stress, you shouldn't be floating. Full stop.

# Don't assume the market is predictable

""Everyone knows rates will drop after the Fed cuts"" — except sometimes they don't (see my post on [The Fed Doesn't Set Your Mortgage Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/MortgageRates/comments/1pjyx3v/the_fed_doesnt_set_your_mortgage_rate/)). The market is forward-looking and often does the opposite of what seems logical.

# Part 8: A Decision Framework

Here's a practical framework you can use:

# Step 1: Define your baseline

What rate are you being offered today? Does this rate work for your budget and financial goals?

* If **yes** → Lean toward locking. You've found a workable rate.
* If **no** → You may need to float, but understand you're floating out of necessity, not strategy.

# Step 2: Assess your timeline

How many days until your rate lock needs to be in place for closing?

* **< 21 days** → Strong lean toward locking. Too little time to recover from adverse moves.
* **21-45 days** → Evaluate other factors. Moderate risk either way.
* **> 45 days** → More flexibility to float, but consider float-down options instead of naked floating.

# Step 3: Check market conditions

What's the current environment?

* **High volatility** (big daily swings, major data releases imminent, Fed uncertainty) → Lean toward locking
* **Low volatility** (stable trading, clear trends) → More flexibility to float if trend is favorable
* **Rates near recent lows** → Consider locking to capture gains
* **Rates near recent highs** → May have room to improve, but beware of catching a falling knife

# Step 4: Evaluate your risk tolerance

Be honest with yourself:

* Will you check rates obsessively and stress about every move? → Lock
* Can you genuinely accept a 0.25% worse outcome without regret? → Floating is viable
* Is your budget tight with no room for error? → Lock

# Step 5: Make the decision and commit

Once you decide, commit to it. Second-guessing yourself constantly is the worst outcome.

* If you lock: Stop obsessing over daily rate movements. You made a good decision to eliminate risk.
* If you float: Set a clear trigger point (""I'll lock if rates hit X or by Y date"") and stick to it

# Part 9: Real Talk — My General Bias

I'll be transparent: **I generally lean toward locking sooner rather than later.**

Here's why:

1. **Most borrowers underestimate risk** — They focus on the upside of floating without fully appreciating the downside.
2. **The market has humbled many smart people** — I've seen sophisticated borrowers convinced rates would drop, only to watch them rise 0.50% while they waited.
3. **A closed loan at a good rate beats a theoretical better rate** — The goal is to buy a home or complete a refinance, not to win a market-timing game.
4. **Stress has real costs** — The anxiety of watching rates daily, second-guessing yourself, and worrying about ""what if"" takes a toll.
5. **Small rate differences matter less than people think** — On a $400,000 loan, the difference between 6.000% and 6.125% is about $33/month. Most people spend more than that on coffee.

That said, I'm not dogmatic about this. There are times when floating makes sense, and I've laid out those scenarios above. But if you're unsure and the current rate works for your budget, my default advice is: **lock it.**

# Key Takeaways

1. **Floating is a bet that rates will improve** — Make sure you understand you're taking market risk.
2. **The downside of floating is often worse than the upside** — Rates can spike faster than they fall.
3. **Lock if:** You're close to closing, at your budget limit, in a volatile market, or risk-averse.
4. **Float if:** You have a long timeline, strong technical setup, specific catalyst, or a float-down option.
5. **Float-down options** can give you the best of both worlds — downside protection with upside potential.
6. **""Lock and monitor""** is a sensible middle ground — secure your rate, then pursue improvements if the market moves significantly.
7. **Don't let small rate differences drive you crazy** — The difference between 6.000% and 6.125% is \~$33/month on a $400K loan.
8. **When in doubt, lock** — A good rate today beats a theoretical better rate tomorrow.

# TL;DR

Floating means betting rates will improve; locking means paying for certainty. Rates can spike faster than they fall, so the risk/reward of floating often isn't symmetric. Lock if you're close to closing, at your budget limit, or can't tolerate a worse outcome. Float if you have a long timeline, favorable technicals, or a float-down option. When in doubt, lock — a good rate today beats a maybe-better rate tomorrow. If the rate works for your budget, take it and move on.

1pnj34t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1pnj34t/theres_something_wrong_with_the_wickenshire_house/,There's something wrong with the Wickenshire House.,"The blaring of my cellphone jolted me awake, and I sat up with a groan.

*Getting too old for this.*

In front of my ragged couch, the TV continued with its black and white parade of old footage from a World War One documentary, though the war seemed nearly over now. Judging by the digital clock on the mantelpiece, which read 3:49 AM, I’d been asleep for at least five hours. My body ached, a familiar problem at my age, but enough that I chided myself for not going to bed earlier like a responsible person. It had been a long day, so I came home to a cold shower, a few hot dogs warmed in the microwave and settled down to watch some television before bed. Of course, at 55 years old I’d misjudged how tired I really was and spent close to half the night slumped on my sofa, which meant I would be paying for it in the morning with stiff joints and a sore back.

Palming my cracked Motorola from the coffee table, I found the TV remote and hit the *mute* button as I answered the call. “Hello?”

Shaky breathing grated on the other end, and after a few moments, a girl’s hushed voice whispered through. “Mr. Todd?”

Ice rippled through my veins at the sound of Cindy’s panicked voice, and I sat up straighter to rub at my bleary eyes. “Yeah, I’m here. You okay? What’s wrong?”

Silence greeted me, a strange mix of static, trembling breaths, and what sounded like sniffles as she tried to hold back tears. “Please . . . help me.”

“Cindy?” Concern building in my mind, I switched on a nearby lamp and pulled myself from the couch with a grunt at the tightness in my lower back. “You there? What’s going on?”

More shaky gasps followed, and just over the static, I thought I heard the faint sound of melodic humming in the background.

“Something’s wrong.” Cindy whispered, her words so quiet that they made each breath sound like cannon fire. “T-The woods are . . . something fell out of the sky and . . . it was so loud, it woke me up. There’s a fire.”

Brow furrowed, I moved fast for the kitchen, stumbling through the dark interior of my little cabin to grope for the light switch. “Stay calm, just stay calm and talk to me. You said there’s a fire? How far away? Can you get to your car?”

Another sniffle came through, clogged with harsh interference as the signal weakened, a sound that made my veins throb with tension. “I-I can’t. Something’s here, it’s in the house, it’s *in the house with me*. W-We can’t get out.”

My throat tried to close up, and I gulped hard against a wave of nausea. “Someone broke in? Are you hurt? Where’s Erin?”

A long pause, and in the background of the mute static, I could have sworn the humming sound cut out, as though whoever it was stopped their eerie melody all at once.

“She’s gone.” Something in Cindy’s tone changed, as if the fear drained away to a blank emotionless rasp, and the line went dead with a chilling *click.*

Every inch of my body racked with a shiver, and both feet seemed glued to the floor in a strange form of dread.

Like so many girls before them, Cindy Fadro and Erin Martinelli had been hired on to be caretakers and actors in the Wickenshire Living History Estate. Erin was 19, studying to be a nurse, while Cindy had just graduated high school and wanted to be a teacher. They were good kids, calm, intelligent, and great workers. Though I never had any children, they were like daughters of my own, and they even baked a cake for my birthday in June. Once they called me in for a leaky pipe, but only after they had done their best to fix it themselves with a tool kit I’d left in the stairwell cupboard. Smart little troopers that they were, the girls even had the common sense to shut the correct valve off and found the leak on their own. Had it been anyone else, I might have considered this to be a prank, a joke, some dumb idea made by bored kids to get a new video for their social media nonsense, but I knew Cindy and Erin.

They didn’t pull pranks like this.

Unnerved, I tried to redial her number but got no answer. Erin’s number yielded the same result, and I shook my head at myself.

*Screw it, I’m not taking any chances.*

I was midway through yanking my work boots on when the sheriff picked up.

*“Hello?”*

From the gruffness in his words, I could tell he’d been asleep as well, but I couldn’t waste time with the standard 911 procedures.

“David, it’s me.” I cinched down the laces on my boots and grabbed my Carhart jacket from its hook by the door. “Cindy just called from the Wickenshire place. There’s a fire on the mountain, and I think someone’s broken into the house. I’m headed there now.”

Rustling on the opposite end of the phone let me know David was up, likely going through the same motions as myself. The son of a Polish man and a Kootenai woman, David Kowolski and I had known each other since high school, and even played football on the same team. Nicknamed ‘White Cloud’ for his European features and Native American blood, he was stubborn with a quick temper, but tenacious when it came to his job. As a law man he drove his deputies relentlessly, backed them to the hilt when it came to any court battles, and as a result he’d managed to keep the crime in Jacob’s Fork quite low over the years. We didn’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I knew I could count on him when it came to something like this. If Cindy or Erin were in danger, Sheriff Kowolski would ride through hell and back to get them out, which was exactly the kind of man I needed right now.

*“I’ll get on the horn to a few of my boys and have them meet you there.”* He replied, and I heard the zipping of a coat on his end, along with the metallic *cha-click* of a handgun slide being racked. *“Fire teams are going to need time to get spun up, so whatever happens, don’t go wandering off without letting me know. Last thing I want is us getting caught in the flames if they decide to move down the mountain.”*

I nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see me and kept the phone pressed to my ear as I swiped my truck keys from the porcelain ashtray near the front door. “Got it.”

*“Be careful, Andy.”* His voice hitched in a low pause, as if the sheriff himself had as bad a feeling about this as I did, and he hung up.

Rain pattered on the windshield of my ancient pickup truck as I wound my way through the dark backroads of northern Idaho, the night sky black with the clouds of late fall. On the sun-faded seat next to me lay my work kit; a simple heavy duty canvas tool bag that held various tools, keys, a flashlight, and an old revolver handed down to me from my grandfather. I used the tools in my job every day as the groundskeeper, janitor, and fix-it-all handyman for the Wickenshire House, which had been part of our small town for as long as anyone could remember. Set on a picturesque 103 acres of fields and woodland in the shadow of the nearby Smoke Point Mountain, the Wickenshire House was a rare example of eastern architecture in the far reaches of the American West. It was the property of our town’s oldest resident, Mr. Edward J. Watkins, a kindly if forgetful soul who’d seen 91 years on this earth and still could drive his own car, though he had a little trouble with stairs. He lived in a cottage on the western edge of town, but I wasn’t about to call him at this time of night, even for something so urgent. Knowing Ed Watkins, he would try to drive out to the house with his slippers on and get hurt stumbling around in the flames.

*Or run into whatever scumbag is in the house, God forbid.*

On the horizon, some of the clouds began to glow, an orange flicker that widened on the mountainside as the distant fire spread. I could barely glimpse an odd plume of smoke in the sky, not curved upward from the fire but downward in a long arc, backlit by the flames. Looking at it, I had a momentary lapse of courage, my resolve wavering. Cindy had said something ‘fell from the sky’. This looked like a trail of some kind, maybe a crashed plane or a fallen weather balloon. If there was jet fuel on the ground, the fire would be even worse to put out than usual. It was horrible, rotten luck all the way around; a wildfire on the same night the house had its first break in, while the girls were there alone.

Adrenaline pumping, I sped up the lonely gravel trail to the house, one of the final sections of public roadways that got this close to the mountain. The Wickenshire House reared from the gloom ahead, its tall gates and Victorian gables illuminated by the dual halos of my truck’s headlights. It still took my breath away, the ornate beauty of the place, built as if every stone had been placed by a perfectionist’s hand. It stood at two stories in height, built from stone mined at the local quarry, with multiple chimneys, a balcony overlooking the back garden, and a grand front porch that wrapped halfway around the entire structure. A stone wall encircled the main grounds, with a wrought iron gate at the drive and several ornamental gardens interspersed throughout. Plush lawns stretched in between, and there were a few oak trees planted there for their brilliant colors in the fall. A small garage had been built around the back of the house sometime in the 1960’s, but this mainly held the riding lawnmower and a small shop where I did most of my repair work. Cindy and Erins’ cars were parked back there, the front gravel lot reserved for visitors during the daily tours. I didn’t see any other vehicle that the intruder might have used, but something else caught my attention in that moment, and held it with a pull like gravity.

*Lord have mercy.*

I stared, slack jawed, at a huge sea of flames that roared through the nearby trees with a voracious appetite. The fire hadn’t wasted any time, chewing through the wet growth as if the rain had never fell, evergreens crackling as they burned to dust in minutes. The heat came through my windshield in a steady increase, warm enough that I couldn’t tell the difference between the fire and my truck heater. The open grassy slopes around the house were consumed as the flames inched closer to the building, and fire closed in from both east and west.

Bounding from my truck, I dashed up to the front door and pulled the handles.

The polished brass knobs rattled but didn’t turn, the flames licking their way across the prairie grass outside the ornate courtyard walls.

*Locked. That means our scumbag didn’t break in through here. Maybe he went around the back?*

With shaking hands, I put down the canvas tool bag and dug in it for my key ring.

Sirens began to wail in the distance, and I finally managed to force the doors open, leaving the keys in the lock to snatch my aged pistol.

“Cindy!” I produced a flashlight with my left hand to hold it beneath my gun, and swept the beam of it over the murky interior. “Erin! Where are you?”

I’d been in the house countless times over the years, but in that moment it felt suffocating, like a great stony maw waiting for me to go far enough in so as to swallow me whole. The foyer led to a large room with a grand staircase, doorways on either side opening to the main dining room and a sitting room respectively. Signs and velvet ropes were posted to guide visitors through the proper areas, a gift shop in the rear of the house near the old parlor, along with guest bathrooms added on to the original back porch. With all the lights off, it looked alien, surreal for this part of the country with its eastern Victorian mystique, and my skin prickled at the sensation that there were eyes in every shadow. Of course, I had been stupid to yell. I’d let my panic get the better of me, and now I had given away the element of surprise. If some creep was in the house somewhere with Erin or Cindy, doing God-knows-what, I wouldn’t be able to sneak up on him now.

*Alright then, might as well move fast.*

With the old revolver grasped in my trembling hands, I headed for the stairs and took them three at a time. The wood creaked under my steps, ancient chestnut and oak that had been sawn before the Great Depression, each footfall like a cannon in the silent house. From here, the roar of the fire outside seemed a muffled whisper, as though there were two different realities, and the house stood guard between them. However, I remembered the heat coming through the windshield of my pickup and knew I didn’t have much time. Soon the house would be in flames, the fire outside enough to melt glass and ignite the wooden siding in minutes.

I reached the top of the stairs and swept my flashlight beam down both ends of the corridor at the top, uncertain of which direction to go first. Cindy and Erin were roomed down the hall to the left, but if someone had indeed broken into the house, Cindy might have hid somewhere else. Every second wasted could mean life or death, and I realized that either way, I’d be turning my back to the unknown.

Something flickered in the beam of my light, a brief whisp of shadow that jerked back behind the far corner of the right-side hallway. I didn’t have more than a moment to see clear details, but there was enough of an image burned into my mind that it came to me in a cold rush.

A face.

*Kowolski, you’d better get here soon.*

Swallowing, I paced down the hallway, my handgun leveled on the spot where the shadow had been.

Upon reaching it, I inched in a wide arc around the corner, bracing for a figure to jump out at me.

The air caught in my throat, and I stared at a section of wallpaper bathed in the aura of my flashlight.

Brownish-black sludge had been daubed on the wall, smeared into a perfect circle so that the excess dripped over the wallpaper like ebony tears. I couldn’t tell if it was mud, blood, or something else, but the corridor stank of rot and the putrid scent of stagnant water. Thorny bits of twig had been woven together, tied here and there with bits of plant fiber to form a circle that overlaid the sludge. Pasted together on the wall, these seemed to make up a protective ring, and in the middle were the handprints.

From what I could see, they were two different sizes, slender fingers and narrow palms indicating two younger females. Both prints faced downwards, slightly overlapping each other at the heel of the palm, and the thumbs arced toward one another like pincers. Unlike the grimy sludge, these were pressed to the old wallpaper in an unmistakable red hue, and it hit me what I was looking at.

*A spider.*

The four fingers of each hand made the legs, the thumbs its mandibles. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the blackness of the outer paste came from petals . . . rose petals to be exact. There were no roses growing in Idaho this time of year, and I’d never seen a natural black rose in my life, yet these appeared fresh. Most had been ground to a powder that gave the foul substance its dark color, others pushed into the muck like decorative flair, giving a strange, heady undertone to the mixture. With this discovery came more clarity; the thorny twigs glued into the circle were not random. They spread inward toward the spider, forming a sharp web of spikes that enshrined it, with the careful touch of an artisan. Such a display would have taken hours to make, certainly longer than the time it took for Cindy to call me. How was this possible?

*“Mr. Todd!”*

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the horrific cry echoing from somewhere behind me, Cindy’s voice tinged in pain and fear.

No sooner had I turned, running a short distance back toward the main corridor at the top of the stairs, and the voice cut out with a high, agonized scream.

“Cindy!” I charged toward the girls’ rooms, heart pounding in my chest.

*“Help me!”* Back in the direction of the symbol, Erin’s voice rang out, choked with sobs and full of torment. *“Mr. Todd, please!”*

Acidic bewilderment slithered through my mind, and I skidded to a stop, caught in the middle of the hallway, the staircase just to my left. I had been so close, perhaps a door away from Erin only moments ago. Could there be more than one intruder holding the girls in separate rooms?

*Cindy is closest. I have to get to her. She sounds like she’s hurt.*

Teeth gritted against the screams of Erin, I forced myself through the left side hallway, her voice ringing in my ears as she begged for my help.

At the end of the hall, I reached the rooms given to the girls and lunged for the handle to Cindy’s.

It didn’t turn, locked from the inside.

Backing up, I drove the heel of my boot into the door next to the lock and heard the old wood splinter. Any other time, I would have balked at such destruction, these doors being over 80 years old, but it didn’t matter anymore. What the fire didn’t get would not be worth Cindy or Erin’s lives.

The door swung open to slap against the bedroom wall, and I dashed inside, revolver in hand.

*What the . . .*

Within the quiet interior of the bedroom, everything looked untouched, the curtains partially open, the bed rumpled from where Cindy had gotten up to check the window, a discarded work uniform in the clothes hamper by the door. Dark stained wood trim lined the walls, windows, and doorway, the walls papered with a robin egg blue pattern that gave it an airy feeling. The white lacy curtains wafted like clouds in the slight draft that came in the open hallway door, and the vintage hot water heater gurgled in the corner as steam worked its way through the pipes. There were modern touches as well, more lamps and lights plugged into the discreet electrical outlets in the walls, a small television on its stand across from the bed, and a side door opened to a shared bathroom between Cindy’s room and Erin’s. This room wasn’t open to tourists, as it was the private living quarters for our workers, so such things were permissible here, as opposed to other parts of the house. Nothing seemed out of place, but there was no sign of Cindy anywhere, no clues to indicate that she’d been there moments ago. It was as if she’d gotten out of bed, looked out the window, and vanished into thin air.

In a flurry of movement, I checked under the bed, in the closet, and the bathroom. When those came back clean, I broke through the bathroom door into Erin’s room, only to find more of the same.

There was no sign of the girls anywhere.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* Erin’s screams continued from the opposite end of the long corridor, and I flung open the bedroom door to retrace my mad dash in her direction, confusion and frustration mounting.

Rounding the corner that bore the strange mark on the wall, I swayed to a stop on the old floorboards next to the door where her screams had come from and yanked on the knob.

*You’ve got to be kidding me . . . how many doors did they lock before I got here?*

With a gasp of exertion, I backed up to kick the door in like the last one, muscles tensed for the effort.

*“Mr. Todd!”* Cindy’s cries exploded from the doorway behind me, rabid and intense as the door rattles on its hinges like she was throwing herself against it from within the room.

I froze, staring at the door, heart racing as my mind whirled. How could she be in there? I’d heard Cindy on the other side of the house not five minutes ago. There was no way she could have moved that fast, not without going past me. I would have seen her in the hall, would have heard the ancient doors creaking on their hinges as they opened.

She couldn’t be in there.

*“Please, help me!”* Erin’s screams started up again, but this time from somewhere in the left-side hallway, and another door began to groan in muted *thuds* as if she too were trying to break it down.

A dry fear crept into my throat, different than what I’d known coming into the house. This didn’t make sense. Erin’s voice had been coming from the door I stood ready to break into, but now it was to my left. Cindy’s had been coming from her room in the west wing but now called from the door behind me. Neither could have left their respective rooms without entering the hall, and I knew for a fact that there weren’t any old-fashioned servant entrances anywhere that could have let them move unnoticed. Something was wrong, very wrong.

Shaken, I took a step away from the door that echoed with Cindy’s voice. “Cindy?”

*“Mr. Todd!”* She begged from the other side of the oak planking, the wood slamming against the jam with wild urgency. *“Please, help me! Please!”*

“The door is locked.” I tried not to hyperventilate as I watched the knob rattle in its socket, knowing fully well the lock was on her side of the door. “Can you let me in?”

Her wails increased in pitch, the screeches an awful combination of agony and terror that made my stomach churn. It sounded as if Cindy was being tormented in the worst ways imaginable, but something about the cadence of each shriek felt off, enough that my brain sent up warning alarms inside my skull.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* She pleaded once more, the same words both girls kept using in various rearrangements over and over, the door shuddering under each blow she made.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I sucked in a breath, eyes focused on the doorknob as it clacked back-and-forth, like Cindy wanted to open it but couldn’t. An uncanny thought rose in my mind, bone-chilling in its clarity, growing louder and louder so that it burst from me before I could stop it.

“Cindy,” I gripped my flashlight so hard that my knuckles turned white. “What’s my first name?”

Like a thunderclap, Cindy’s pleas ceased, along with Erin’s, so that the entire house fell into dead silence. Nothing moved, and even the muffled roar of the wildfire outside seemed deadened further than before, as though the house was a vacuum of sound. My skin crawled, the air thick in my lungs, and a strange certainty took hold of me that made the sense of dread even worse as Cindy’s words about Erin trickled through my brain.

*She’s gone.*

*Click.*

To my right, a doorknob at the far end of the hallway unlocked.

*Click.*

Another lock slid open, this one closer, the doors remaining shut as more joined them one-by-one.

*Click.*

*Click.*

*Click.*

A twinge of panic tightened in my throat, but I leveled the beam of my flashlight at the first door that had unlocked, blood surging in my temples. Everything seemed loud, the heartbeat in my chest, the breath in my lungs, the groan of the floorboards under my boots. My vision narrowed, a vibration hummed to life inside my skull, and I tasted metal on my tongue. In my hand, the flashlight began to flicker as if the batteries were struggling to remain lit, and I couldn’t lift the revolver, my arms refusing to move like the gun weighed as much as a car.

The locks carried on past me, every door on the second story unlocking itself in a continuous march, until at last, the final *click* resounded from the far hallway like cannon fire to my ears.

For a moment, the silence returned, so thick it may as well have been water.

*Wham.*

Every door on the second story flung open, impacting against the wall inside their respective rooms so hard that I heard plaster *crunch*, the hinges squealing on old dust.

With them came the screams.

There were hundreds of voices, some human, others less so, bellowing at the top of their lungs to be heard over one another. If they were saying any words, they were lost among the throng, a constant roar of vocals that soured in my ears for the sheer volume of it. Somewhere among the morass, I could barely catch the sound of Erin and Cindy’s voices shrieking with the others, a morbid choir of pain, suffering, and fear. It seemed to seep out of the floorboards, ooze from the heater vents, and rebound off the walls in every direction. With the doors open, the deep orange glow of the flames outside poured into the house like a tidal wave, but oddly enough no heat came with it, the hallway as cold as if I’d stepped into a freezer. The shadows elongated in the firelight, swaying as they inched up the papered walls, and a pungent smell followed them.

Roses.

It came with overpowering strength, sickly-sweet, but unmistakable. As the tide of shadows advanced down the hall toward me, the fermented stink of roses filled the air like poison gas, and I tasted copper on my lips.

*I have to get out of here.*

Coughing on the blood running from both nostrils, I stumbled toward the stairs, my head a mess of static. Like a tide of slithering vines, the inky shadows pursued me with ravenous hunger. I could feel their magnetic pull, the chorus of screams still ringing across the house with deafening volume, a terrible siren song that tugged at something deep within my subconscious. Voices, so many voices, begged me to stay, to go back, to find the darkest room and sink myself into the abyss until it drowned me.

Something tightened on my ankle just as I reached the top of the staircase, and I toppled headlong down the steps.

*Bam.*

My hip rammed into a banister, and I lost my grip on the pistol.

*Wham.*

Another step hit my shoulder, and I felt my teeth bite into my tongue, the flashlight clattering away into the floor below.

*Smack.*

My head connected with the floorboards at the landing, and the blackness threatened to close over my eyes for the last time.

*Creak.*

One of the steps flexed under the weight of a foot, and I gulped air in pain to squint at the shadows.

*Creak.*

Another footstep echoed toward me, something at the top of the steps descending with a slow, methodical gait. It didn’t sound heavy, not the deft pace of a large man or thick boot, but almost delicate, light, graceful. Yet, there was something about each carefully placed step, each sigh and squeak of the aged woodwork that made my skin wriggle. Something was coming, something that knew exactly where I was even in the pitch blackness of the house.

It was watching me, *stalking* me through the shadows like a cat with a mouse.

Desperate fear surged in my brain, and I clawed through the dark on my stomach to find a way out. I last remembered the front door being nearby, but it seemed to take an eternity to move across the cold floorboards, the unseen presence mere yards behind me as I wriggled forward.

At last, I managed to gain my footing, though it hurt to put weight on my right leg, and hurled myself forward in the blind shadows.

*Thud.*

Both front doors flew open, and I tumbled out onto the porch, rolling down the steps into the stones of the walkway.

Like a switch had been thrown, the world seemed to come alive once more, the cold sensation fading, the sound returning. Sirens wailed closer as headlights appeared in the long gravel driveway, and the crackle of flames roared from the trees. Smoke filled my nostrils, heat from the nearby fire licked over my skin, and I rolled onto my side to look back toward the house.

My lungs tightened, and I stared, unable to pull my eyes away.

Inside the open front doorway, nothing was visible, not the glint of firelight from inside, nor the faint glow of it coming through any ground windows. The entrance was a mass of impenetrable shadows that seemed to form a solid wall at the threshold, yet deep within that abyss, something stared back.

It had no shape, no form that I could identify it with, but there was definitely a presence that stood just beyond the light, watching me from the gloom. My eyes seemed fastened to it, either by my own primordial fear, or perhaps willed so by whatever peered out of the wretched expanse. A torrent of emotions ripped through my mind, warped and misshapen, like cold fingers pried at the taps of my humanity to unleash a maelstrom of feeling. Hunger and fear. Hate and despair. Lust and sadness. Grief and pain. They all rolled over one another, tumbling in and out of each other in a never-ending tide, and it hit me with a strangled form of clarity that these weren’t *my* emotions.

Locked in place by the unknown being’s gaze, I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as cry out, my only option to fight back with what little expression I had left.

*What are you?*

Something about my terrified thought seemed to strike a chord within the cascade of terrible shadow, for the next instant the doors on the house creaked in their wrought-iron hinges, and then swung shut on their own.

The rest of the night was a blur, a stupor, one that I wandered through in a mindless fog. Firefighting crews appeared from miles around to help put out the blaze, but not before it chewed through all 103 acres on the Wickenshire estate. Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was burned to cinders. Even boulders cracked from the intense heat, the smoke pall so large it could be seen from Montana, or so I heard. One of the fire trucks exploded when its fuel tank caught fire and killed three men. Everything burned . . . except the house.

For some reason, the fire stopped at the stone courtyard walls and went no further. In a blaze hot enough that it had turned some minor sandpits on the mountain to crude glass, there wasn’t so much as a scorch mark on the house or its outbuildings. None of the paint peeled, the siding wasn’t so much as warm to the touch, and all the plants withing the yard were unscathed. The investigators couldn’t even find ash on the roof from the fire afterwards, not a single flake. Unlike its ruined acreage, the Wickenshire House had survived the wildfire unharmed, and no one could make any sense of it.

Once the fire was finally put out, they took me to the local clinic for my injuries, a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and a concussion from my tumble down the stairs. Sheriff Kowolski visited in the morning to see how I was, and to fill me in on what I’d missed once they trucked me away from the site.

Over three hundred search and rescue volunteers had been called out, along with special forensics teams from neighboring counties, and they hadn’t found any sign of Cindy Fadro or Erin Martinelli. The last time they managed to ping Cindy’s phone via satellite, it had registered a mile up the slope from the house, but they never managed to recover the device. Tracking dogs refused to go near the house and seemed to lose all scent once they left the property boundaries. No trace of Erin was discovered, and no DNA could be found in either of the girls’ rooms to point to a culprit. One of the searchers claimed he had heard what sounded like a female voice screaming for help on the northern slope, but he wasn’t sure where it had come from, and no one else could verify it. Another man claimed he saw someone walking inside the tree line near the eastern edge of the property but never got a good glimpse at their face to see who they were. With all speculation bereft of evidence, it seemed to everyone that both Cindy and Erin had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Worse yet, when I described my account to the sheriff, he informed me that his team hadn’t found any symbols painted on the walls, nor did they see anything out of the ordinary. All they found that aligned with my story was the strange, overwhelming aroma of roses that permeated the house.

Nothing more.

That was six weeks ago. I got out of the clinic within a few days after the event, but the continued search efforts proved fruitless. With their investigation coming up cold, the sheriff’s office released the house back to Mr. Watkins, who closed it indefinitely. I had never seen him so distraught in my life, as Ed took the girls’ disappearance rather hard. He felt personally responsible, though we all knew there wasn’t anything he could have done, especially since no one knew what happened to Erin or Cindy. However, Ed apparently decided to go there himself late one evening to do some looking around the house and didn’t bother to tell anyone else. It wasn’t until his cleaning lady stopped by his cottage in Jacob’s Fork the next morning that Ed was reported missing, and police dispatched to the Wickenshire House.

They never found him.

His car was parked out front, the doors unlocked, but they couldn’t find a trace of Edward Watkins anywhere on the property. I helped with the search, as I basically slept in the sheriff’s office these days, and found no sign of a struggle or any other foul play, only the smell of roses. We dug deep this time, rifled through local records, archives, property history, everything we could get our hands on about the estate. There was nothing to indicate this place would be trouble, no forgotten building plans with hidden rooms, no land disputes with older tenants, no tribal issues from burial grounds or holy sites. The property was normal, and even when I poked around to see if there had been any deaths, suicides, or other sordid affairs associated with the house, my search came up blank. There was no reason for this to be happen, not from human effort, or anything else.

Even now, as December drags on, nothing has been the same. No plants grow in the burned zone, not even the smallest patch of liken or moss, as if the ground is poisoned to its core. Animals avoid it, so that the uncharred sections of forest around the property are empty, silent places. The access road is chained off to keep curious locals away, and Sheriff Kowolski let me bunk at a small ranger cabin at the base of the mountain just so I could keep tabs on the place. I think he knew I needed to be close, to keep an eye on the house, and keep looking for answers. I can’t explain why, but I know something is in there, waiting, biding its time. It failed to get me that night, but I have a terrible premonition that it doesn’t need *me*.

It just needs *more*.

I’ve found markers in the last few days. Piles of bones. Not haphazard from an animal kill, but stacked, organized, purposeful. Bits of twine made from plant fibers hold them together, and despite being in the open, no animals will bother them, not even the vultures. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, they think I can’t process the girls being gone, but I’ve stumbled on over a dozen of them now. They seemed to be set in a wide ring around the property line, spanning outward from the house into the forest beyond, capturing more territory by the day. No matter how many times I remove them, the piles always reappear, with fresh bones added to the stacks. I don’t touch them anymore, and I don’t even make eye contact with the empty eye sockets of the skulls. The few times I have, I heard whispers in my sleep, and had nightmares of eyes in the shadows of my room.

Some of the bones are like those of a rabbit or mole, while others are bigger like elk or bear. Every pile is topped with a skull, most of them from small game, but five of the piles hold unique skulls; a bear, a coyote, an eagle, a snake, and lastly, a great bull elk. They are laid out opposite one another ringing the house, the rest of the smaller markers ranging from them into the forest beyond. Of all the markers, the one with the elk skull is tallest, its full spread of antlers still intact so that it is nine feet high at the eye sockets. I found a symbol painted onto the bone forehead with powdered charcoal that the rain never seems to wash away, no matter how many times I go up to it.

A spider.

One made of two slender, inverted hands, both the same size.

I’m posting this so that it’s on record, in case one of these days I don’t come back from that mountain. Service was always spotty up there before, but ever since that night, it’s been non-existent. Even the few trail cameras I’ve put out have either gone dead or produced nothing but blurry photos. Something is building these markers, watching me whenever I walk the perimeter, and shifting in the corners of my vision whenever I turn my head. I’ve discovered trail signs that have been purposefully moved to misdirect me. Sometimes I hear screams in the woods, distant and warped, but they sound like Erin’s cries. I see flashes of blonde hair in the bushes that I want to believe is Cindy, but I know it can’t be.

They’re gone, both of them.

Only the sheriff understands, even if he doesn’t say much to that effect. I can see it in his eyes, he knows that I’m telling the truth, and his own deputies have been up to the house to see the piles multiple times. There’s nothing they can do, nothing but wait from the valley below and hope that the snow buries whatever it is for the winter.

There’s something wrong with the Wickenshire House, something *inside* it, something unseen that walks the grounds day and night. It wants more than the estate, I can feel it, can taste it in the wind, hear it in the dry crunch of snow under my boots, and feel it in the shivers I get every time I look at the dark, barren windows of that cursed structure.

It wants the forest, the trees, the mountain.

It wants *everything*.",1,1765833024.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

*Getting too old for this.*

In front of my ragged couch, the TV continued with its black and white parade of old footage from a World War One documentary, though the war seemed nearly over now. Judging by the digital clock on the mantelpiece, which read 3:49 AM, I’d been asleep for at least five hours. My body ached, a familiar problem at my age, but enough that I chided myself for not going to bed earlier like a responsible person. It had been a long day, so I came home to a cold shower, a few hot dogs warmed in the microwave and settled down to watch some television before bed. Of course, at 55 years old I’d misjudged how tired I really was and spent close to half the night slumped on my sofa, which meant I would be paying for it in the morning with stiff joints and a sore back.

Palming my cracked Motorola from the coffee table, I found the TV remote and hit the *mute* button as I answered the call. “Hello?”

Shaky breathing grated on the other end, and after a few moments, a girl’s hushed voice whispered through. “Mr. Todd?”

Ice rippled through my veins at the sound of Cindy’s panicked voice, and I sat up straighter to rub at my bleary eyes. “Yeah, I’m here. You okay? What’s wrong?”

Silence greeted me, a strange mix of static, trembling breaths, and what sounded like sniffles as she tried to hold back tears. “Please . . . help me.”

“Cindy?” Concern building in my mind, I switched on a nearby lamp and pulled myself from the couch with a grunt at the tightness in my lower back. “You there? What’s going on?”

More shaky gasps followed, and just over the static, I thought I heard the faint sound of melodic humming in the background.

“Something’s wrong.” Cindy whispered, her words so quiet that they made each breath sound like cannon fire. “T-The woods are . . . something fell out of the sky and . . . it was so loud, it woke me up. There’s a fire.”

Brow furrowed, I moved fast for the kitchen, stumbling through the dark interior of my little cabin to grope for the light switch. “Stay calm, just stay calm and talk to me. You said there’s a fire? How far away? Can you get to your car?”

Another sniffle came through, clogged with harsh interference as the signal weakened, a sound that made my veins throb with tension. “I-I can’t. Something’s here, it’s in the house, it’s *in the house with me*. W-We can’t get out.”

My throat tried to close up, and I gulped hard against a wave of nausea. “Someone broke in? Are you hurt? Where’s Erin?”

A long pause, and in the background of the mute static, I could have sworn the humming sound cut out, as though whoever it was stopped their eerie melody all at once.

“She’s gone.” Something in Cindy’s tone changed, as if the fear drained away to a blank emotionless rasp, and the line went dead with a chilling *click.*

Every inch of my body racked with a shiver, and both feet seemed glued to the floor in a strange form of dread.

Like so many girls before them, Cindy Fadro and Erin Martinelli had been hired on to be caretakers and actors in the Wickenshire Living History Estate. Erin was 19, studying to be a nurse, while Cindy had just graduated high school and wanted to be a teacher. They were good kids, calm, intelligent, and great workers. Though I never had any children, they were like daughters of my own, and they even baked a cake for my birthday in June. Once they called me in for a leaky pipe, but only after they had done their best to fix it themselves with a tool kit I’d left in the stairwell cupboard. Smart little troopers that they were, the girls even had the common sense to shut the correct valve off and found the leak on their own. Had it been anyone else, I might have considered this to be a prank, a joke, some dumb idea made by bored kids to get a new video for their social media nonsense, but I knew Cindy and Erin.

They didn’t pull pranks like this.

Unnerved, I tried to redial her number but got no answer. Erin’s number yielded the same result, and I shook my head at myself.

*Screw it, I’m not taking any chances.*

I was midway through yanking my work boots on when the sheriff picked up.

*“Hello?”*

From the gruffness in his words, I could tell he’d been asleep as well, but I couldn’t waste time with the standard 911 procedures.

“David, it’s me.” I cinched down the laces on my boots and grabbed my Carhart jacket from its hook by the door. “Cindy just called from the Wickenshire place. There’s a fire on the mountain, and I think someone’s broken into the house. I’m headed there now.”

Rustling on the opposite end of the phone let me know David was up, likely going through the same motions as myself. The son of a Polish man and a Kootenai woman, David Kowolski and I had known each other since high school, and even played football on the same team. Nicknamed ‘White Cloud’ for his European features and Native American blood, he was stubborn with a quick temper, but tenacious when it came to his job. As a law man he drove his deputies relentlessly, backed them to the hilt when it came to any court battles, and as a result he’d managed to keep the crime in Jacob’s Fork quite low over the years. We didn’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I knew I could count on him when it came to something like this. If Cindy or Erin were in danger, Sheriff Kowolski would ride through hell and back to get them out, which was exactly the kind of man I needed right now.

*“I’ll get on the horn to a few of my boys and have them meet you there.”* He replied, and I heard the zipping of a coat on his end, along with the metallic *cha-click* of a handgun slide being racked. *“Fire teams are going to need time to get spun up, so whatever happens, don’t go wandering off without letting me know. Last thing I want is us getting caught in the flames if they decide to move down the mountain.”*

I nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see me and kept the phone pressed to my ear as I swiped my truck keys from the porcelain ashtray near the front door. “Got it.”

*“Be careful, Andy.”* His voice hitched in a low pause, as if the sheriff himself had as bad a feeling about this as I did, and he hung up.

Rain pattered on the windshield of my ancient pickup truck as I wound my way through the dark backroads of northern Idaho, the night sky black with the clouds of late fall. On the sun-faded seat next to me lay my work kit; a simple heavy duty canvas tool bag that held various tools, keys, a flashlight, and an old revolver handed down to me from my grandfather. I used the tools in my job every day as the groundskeeper, janitor, and fix-it-all handyman for the Wickenshire House, which had been part of our small town for as long as anyone could remember. Set on a picturesque 103 acres of fields and woodland in the shadow of the nearby Smoke Point Mountain, the Wickenshire House was a rare example of eastern architecture in the far reaches of the American West. It was the property of our town’s oldest resident, Mr. Edward J. Watkins, a kindly if forgetful soul who’d seen 91 years on this earth and still could drive his own car, though he had a little trouble with stairs. He lived in a cottage on the western edge of town, but I wasn’t about to call him at this time of night, even for something so urgent. Knowing Ed Watkins, he would try to drive out to the house with his slippers on and get hurt stumbling around in the flames.

*Or run into whatever scumbag is in the house, God forbid.*

On the horizon, some of the clouds began to glow, an orange flicker that widened on the mountainside as the distant fire spread. I could barely glimpse an odd plume of smoke in the sky, not curved upward from the fire but downward in a long arc, backlit by the flames. Looking at it, I had a momentary lapse of courage, my resolve wavering. Cindy had said something ‘fell from the sky’. This looked like a trail of some kind, maybe a crashed plane or a fallen weather balloon. If there was jet fuel on the ground, the fire would be even worse to put out than usual. It was horrible, rotten luck all the way around; a wildfire on the same night the house had its first break in, while the girls were there alone.

Adrenaline pumping, I sped up the lonely gravel trail to the house, one of the final sections of public roadways that got this close to the mountain. The Wickenshire House reared from the gloom ahead, its tall gates and Victorian gables illuminated by the dual halos of my truck’s headlights. It still took my breath away, the ornate beauty of the place, built as if every stone had been placed by a perfectionist’s hand. It stood at two stories in height, built from stone mined at the local quarry, with multiple chimneys, a balcony overlooking the back garden, and a grand front porch that wrapped halfway around the entire structure. A stone wall encircled the main grounds, with a wrought iron gate at the drive and several ornamental gardens interspersed throughout. Plush lawns stretched in between, and there were a few oak trees planted there for their brilliant colors in the fall. A small garage had been built around the back of the house sometime in the 1960’s, but this mainly held the riding lawnmower and a small shop where I did most of my repair work. Cindy and Erins’ cars were parked back there, the front gravel lot reserved for visitors during the daily tours. I didn’t see any other vehicle that the intruder might have used, but something else caught my attention in that moment, and held it with a pull like gravity.

*Lord have mercy.*

I stared, slack jawed, at a huge sea of flames that roared through the nearby trees with a voracious appetite. The fire hadn’t wasted any time, chewing through the wet growth as if the rain had never fell, evergreens crackling as they burned to dust in minutes. The heat came through my windshield in a steady increase, warm enough that I couldn’t tell the difference between the fire and my truck heater. The open grassy slopes around the house were consumed as the flames inched closer to the building, and fire closed in from both east and west.

Bounding from my truck, I dashed up to the front door and pulled the handles.

The polished brass knobs rattled but didn’t turn, the flames licking their way across the prairie grass outside the ornate courtyard walls.

*Locked. That means our scumbag didn’t break in through here. Maybe he went around the back?*

With shaking hands, I put down the canvas tool bag and dug in it for my key ring.

Sirens began to wail in the distance, and I finally managed to force the doors open, leaving the keys in the lock to snatch my aged pistol.

“Cindy!” I produced a flashlight with my left hand to hold it beneath my gun, and swept the beam of it over the murky interior. “Erin! Where are you?”

I’d been in the house countless times over the years, but in that moment it felt suffocating, like a great stony maw waiting for me to go far enough in so as to swallow me whole. The foyer led to a large room with a grand staircase, doorways on either side opening to the main dining room and a sitting room respectively. Signs and velvet ropes were posted to guide visitors through the proper areas, a gift shop in the rear of the house near the old parlor, along with guest bathrooms added on to the original back porch. With all the lights off, it looked alien, surreal for this part of the country with its eastern Victorian mystique, and my skin prickled at the sensation that there were eyes in every shadow. Of course, I had been stupid to yell. I’d let my panic get the better of me, and now I had given away the element of surprise. If some creep was in the house somewhere with Erin or Cindy, doing God-knows-what, I wouldn’t be able to sneak up on him now.

*Alright then, might as well move fast.*

With the old revolver grasped in my trembling hands, I headed for the stairs and took them three at a time. The wood creaked under my steps, ancient chestnut and oak that had been sawn before the Great Depression, each footfall like a cannon in the silent house. From here, the roar of the fire outside seemed a muffled whisper, as though there were two different realities, and the house stood guard between them. However, I remembered the heat coming through the windshield of my pickup and knew I didn’t have much time. Soon the house would be in flames, the fire outside enough to melt glass and ignite the wooden siding in minutes.

I reached the top of the stairs and swept my flashlight beam down both ends of the corridor at the top, uncertain of which direction to go first. Cindy and Erin were roomed down the hall to the left, but if someone had indeed broken into the house, Cindy might have hid somewhere else. Every second wasted could mean life or death, and I realized that either way, I’d be turning my back to the unknown.

Something flickered in the beam of my light, a brief whisp of shadow that jerked back behind the far corner of the right-side hallway. I didn’t have more than a moment to see clear details, but there was enough of an image burned into my mind that it came to me in a cold rush.

A face.

*Kowolski, you’d better get here soon.*

Swallowing, I paced down the hallway, my handgun leveled on the spot where the shadow had been.

Upon reaching it, I inched in a wide arc around the corner, bracing for a figure to jump out at me.

The air caught in my throat, and I stared at a section of wallpaper bathed in the aura of my flashlight.

Brownish-black sludge had been daubed on the wall, smeared into a perfect circle so that the excess dripped over the wallpaper like ebony tears. I couldn’t tell if it was mud, blood, or something else, but the corridor stank of rot and the putrid scent of stagnant water. Thorny bits of twig had been woven together, tied here and there with bits of plant fiber to form a circle that overlaid the sludge. Pasted together on the wall, these seemed to make up a protective ring, and in the middle were the handprints.

From what I could see, they were two different sizes, slender fingers and narrow palms indicating two younger females. Both prints faced downwards, slightly overlapping each other at the heel of the palm, and the thumbs arced toward one another like pincers. Unlike the grimy sludge, these were pressed to the old wallpaper in an unmistakable red hue, and it hit me what I was looking at.

*A spider.*

The four fingers of each hand made the legs, the thumbs its mandibles. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the blackness of the outer paste came from petals . . . rose petals to be exact. There were no roses growing in Idaho this time of year, and I’d never seen a natural black rose in my life, yet these appeared fresh. Most had been ground to a powder that gave the foul substance its dark color, others pushed into the muck like decorative flair, giving a strange, heady undertone to the mixture. With this discovery came more clarity; the thorny twigs glued into the circle were not random. They spread inward toward the spider, forming a sharp web of spikes that enshrined it, with the careful touch of an artisan. Such a display would have taken hours to make, certainly longer than the time it took for Cindy to call me. How was this possible?

*“Mr. Todd!”*

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the horrific cry echoing from somewhere behind me, Cindy’s voice tinged in pain and fear.

No sooner had I turned, running a short distance back toward the main corridor at the top of the stairs, and the voice cut out with a high, agonized scream.

“Cindy!” I charged toward the girls’ rooms, heart pounding in my chest.

*“Help me!”* Back in the direction of the symbol, Erin’s voice rang out, choked with sobs and full of torment. *“Mr. Todd, please!”*

Acidic bewilderment slithered through my mind, and I skidded to a stop, caught in the middle of the hallway, the staircase just to my left. I had been so close, perhaps a door away from Erin only moments ago. Could there be more than one intruder holding the girls in separate rooms?

*Cindy is closest. I have to get to her. She sounds like she’s hurt.*

Teeth gritted against the screams of Erin, I forced myself through the left side hallway, her voice ringing in my ears as she begged for my help.

At the end of the hall, I reached the rooms given to the girls and lunged for the handle to Cindy’s.

It didn’t turn, locked from the inside.

Backing up, I drove the heel of my boot into the door next to the lock and heard the old wood splinter. Any other time, I would have balked at such destruction, these doors being over 80 years old, but it didn’t matter anymore. What the fire didn’t get would not be worth Cindy or Erin’s lives.

The door swung open to slap against the bedroom wall, and I dashed inside, revolver in hand.

*What the . . .*

Within the quiet interior of the bedroom, everything looked untouched, the curtains partially open, the bed rumpled from where Cindy had gotten up to check the window, a discarded work uniform in the clothes hamper by the door. Dark stained wood trim lined the walls, windows, and doorway, the walls papered with a robin egg blue pattern that gave it an airy feeling. The white lacy curtains wafted like clouds in the slight draft that came in the open hallway door, and the vintage hot water heater gurgled in the corner as steam worked its way through the pipes. There were modern touches as well, more lamps and lights plugged into the discreet electrical outlets in the walls, a small television on its stand across from the bed, and a side door opened to a shared bathroom between Cindy’s room and Erin’s. This room wasn’t open to tourists, as it was the private living quarters for our workers, so such things were permissible here, as opposed to other parts of the house. Nothing seemed out of place, but there was no sign of Cindy anywhere, no clues to indicate that she’d been there moments ago. It was as if she’d gotten out of bed, looked out the window, and vanished into thin air.

In a flurry of movement, I checked under the bed, in the closet, and the bathroom. When those came back clean, I broke through the bathroom door into Erin’s room, only to find more of the same.

There was no sign of the girls anywhere.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* Erin’s screams continued from the opposite end of the long corridor, and I flung open the bedroom door to retrace my mad dash in her direction, confusion and frustration mounting.

Rounding the corner that bore the strange mark on the wall, I swayed to a stop on the old floorboards next to the door where her screams had come from and yanked on the knob.

*You’ve got to be kidding me . . . how many doors did they lock before I got here?*

With a gasp of exertion, I backed up to kick the door in like the last one, muscles tensed for the effort.

*“Mr. Todd!”* Cindy’s cries exploded from the doorway behind me, rabid and intense as the door rattles on its hinges like she was throwing herself against it from within the room.

I froze, staring at the door, heart racing as my mind whirled. How could she be in there? I’d heard Cindy on the other side of the house not five minutes ago. There was no way she could have moved that fast, not without going past me. I would have seen her in the hall, would have heard the ancient doors creaking on their hinges as they opened.

She couldn’t be in there.

*“Please, help me!”* Erin’s screams started up again, but this time from somewhere in the left-side hallway, and another door began to groan in muted *thuds* as if she too were trying to break it down.

A dry fear crept into my throat, different than what I’d known coming into the house. This didn’t make sense. Erin’s voice had been coming from the door I stood ready to break into, but now it was to my left. Cindy’s had been coming from her room in the west wing but now called from the door behind me. Neither could have left their respective rooms without entering the hall, and I knew for a fact that there weren’t any old-fashioned servant entrances anywhere that could have let them move unnoticed. Something was wrong, very wrong.

Shaken, I took a step away from the door that echoed with Cindy’s voice. “Cindy?”

*“Mr. Todd!”* She begged from the other side of the oak planking, the wood slamming against the jam with wild urgency. *“Please, help me! Please!”*

“The door is locked.” I tried not to hyperventilate as I watched the knob rattle in its socket, knowing fully well the lock was on her side of the door. “Can you let me in?”

Her wails increased in pitch, the screeches an awful combination of agony and terror that made my stomach churn. It sounded as if Cindy was being tormented in the worst ways imaginable, but something about the cadence of each shriek felt off, enough that my brain sent up warning alarms inside my skull.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* She pleaded once more, the same words both girls kept using in various rearrangements over and over, the door shuddering under each blow she made.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I sucked in a breath, eyes focused on the doorknob as it clacked back-and-forth, like Cindy wanted to open it but couldn’t. An uncanny thought rose in my mind, bone-chilling in its clarity, growing louder and louder so that it burst from me before I could stop it.

“Cindy,” I gripped my flashlight so hard that my knuckles turned white. “What’s my first name?”

Like a thunderclap, Cindy’s pleas ceased, along with Erin’s, so that the entire house fell into dead silence. Nothing moved, and even the muffled roar of the wildfire outside seemed deadened further than before, as though the house was a vacuum of sound. My skin crawled, the air thick in my lungs, and a strange certainty took hold of me that made the sense of dread even worse as Cindy’s words about Erin trickled through my brain.

*She’s gone.*

*Click.*

To my right, a doorknob at the far end of the hallway unlocked.

*Click.*

Another lock slid open, this one closer, the doors remaining shut as more joined them one-by-one.

*Click.*

*Click.*

*Click.*

A twinge of panic tightened in my throat, but I leveled the beam of my flashlight at the first door that had unlocked, blood surging in my temples. Everything seemed loud, the heartbeat in my chest, the breath in my lungs, the groan of the floorboards under my boots. My vision narrowed, a vibration hummed to life inside my skull, and I tasted metal on my tongue. In my hand, the flashlight began to flicker as if the batteries were struggling to remain lit, and I couldn’t lift the revolver, my arms refusing to move like the gun weighed as much as a car.

The locks carried on past me, every door on the second story unlocking itself in a continuous march, until at last, the final *click* resounded from the far hallway like cannon fire to my ears.

For a moment, the silence returned, so thick it may as well have been water.

*Wham.*

Every door on the second story flung open, impacting against the wall inside their respective rooms so hard that I heard plaster *crunch*, the hinges squealing on old dust.

With them came the screams.

There were hundreds of voices, some human, others less so, bellowing at the top of their lungs to be heard over one another. If they were saying any words, they were lost among the throng, a constant roar of vocals that soured in my ears for the sheer volume of it. Somewhere among the morass, I could barely catch the sound of Erin and Cindy’s voices shrieking with the others, a morbid choir of pain, suffering, and fear. It seemed to seep out of the floorboards, ooze from the heater vents, and rebound off the walls in every direction. With the doors open, the deep orange glow of the flames outside poured into the house like a tidal wave, but oddly enough no heat came with it, the hallway as cold as if I’d stepped into a freezer. The shadows elongated in the firelight, swaying as they inched up the papered walls, and a pungent smell followed them.

Roses.

It came with overpowering strength, sickly-sweet, but unmistakable. As the tide of shadows advanced down the hall toward me, the fermented stink of roses filled the air like poison gas, and I tasted copper on my lips.

*I have to get out of here.*

Coughing on the blood running from both nostrils, I stumbled toward the stairs, my head a mess of static. Like a tide of slithering vines, the inky shadows pursued me with ravenous hunger. I could feel their magnetic pull, the chorus of screams still ringing across the house with deafening volume, a terrible siren song that tugged at something deep within my subconscious. Voices, so many voices, begged me to stay, to go back, to find the darkest room and sink myself into the abyss until it drowned me.

Something tightened on my ankle just as I reached the top of the staircase, and I toppled headlong down the steps.

*Bam.*

My hip rammed into a banister, and I lost my grip on the pistol.

*Wham.*

Another step hit my shoulder, and I felt my teeth bite into my tongue, the flashlight clattering away into the floor below.

*Smack.*

My head connected with the floorboards at the landing, and the blackness threatened to close over my eyes for the last time.

*Creak.*

One of the steps flexed under the weight of a foot, and I gulped air in pain to squint at the shadows.

*Creak.*

Another footstep echoed toward me, something at the top of the steps descending with a slow, methodical gait. It didn’t sound heavy, not the deft pace of a large man or thick boot, but almost delicate, light, graceful. Yet, there was something about each carefully placed step, each sigh and squeak of the aged woodwork that made my skin wriggle. Something was coming, something that knew exactly where I was even in the pitch blackness of the house.

It was watching me, *stalking* me through the shadows like a cat with a mouse.

Desperate fear surged in my brain, and I clawed through the dark on my stomach to find a way out. I last remembered the front door being nearby, but it seemed to take an eternity to move across the cold floorboards, the unseen presence mere yards behind me as I wriggled forward.

At last, I managed to gain my footing, though it hurt to put weight on my right leg, and hurled myself forward in the blind shadows.

*Thud.*

Both front doors flew open, and I tumbled out onto the porch, rolling down the steps into the stones of the walkway.

Like a switch had been thrown, the world seemed to come alive once more, the cold sensation fading, the sound returning. Sirens wailed closer as headlights appeared in the long gravel driveway, and the crackle of flames roared from the trees. Smoke filled my nostrils, heat from the nearby fire licked over my skin, and I rolled onto my side to look back toward the house.

My lungs tightened, and I stared, unable to pull my eyes away.

Inside the open front doorway, nothing was visible, not the glint of firelight from inside, nor the faint glow of it coming through any ground windows. The entrance was a mass of impenetrable shadows that seemed to form a solid wall at the threshold, yet deep within that abyss, something stared back.

It had no shape, no form that I could identify it with, but there was definitely a presence that stood just beyond the light, watching me from the gloom. My eyes seemed fastened to it, either by my own primordial fear, or perhaps willed so by whatever peered out of the wretched expanse. A torrent of emotions ripped through my mind, warped and misshapen, like cold fingers pried at the taps of my humanity to unleash a maelstrom of feeling. Hunger and fear. Hate and despair. Lust and sadness. Grief and pain. They all rolled over one another, tumbling in and out of each other in a never-ending tide, and it hit me with a strangled form of clarity that these weren’t *my* emotions.

Locked in place by the unknown being’s gaze, I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as cry out, my only option to fight back with what little expression I had left.

*What are you?*

Something about my terrified thought seemed to strike a chord within the cascade of terrible shadow, for the next instant the doors on the house creaked in their wrought-iron hinges, and then swung shut on their own.

The rest of the night was a blur, a stupor, one that I wandered through in a mindless fog. Firefighting crews appeared from miles around to help put out the blaze, but not before it chewed through all 103 acres on the Wickenshire estate. Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was burned to cinders. Even boulders cracked from the intense heat, the smoke pall so large it could be seen from Montana, or so I heard. One of the fire trucks exploded when its fuel tank caught fire and killed three men. Everything burned . . . except the house.

For some reason, the fire stopped at the stone courtyard walls and went no further. In a blaze hot enough that it had turned some minor sandpits on the mountain to crude glass, there wasn’t so much as a scorch mark on the house or its outbuildings. None of the paint peeled, the siding wasn’t so much as warm to the touch, and all the plants withing the yard were unscathed. The investigators couldn’t even find ash on the roof from the fire afterwards, not a single flake. Unlike its ruined acreage, the Wickenshire House had survived the wildfire unharmed, and no one could make any sense of it.

Once the fire was finally put out, they took me to the local clinic for my injuries, a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and a concussion from my tumble down the stairs. Sheriff Kowolski visited in the morning to see how I was, and to fill me in on what I’d missed once they trucked me away from the site.

Over three hundred search and rescue volunteers had been called out, along with special forensics teams from neighboring counties, and they hadn’t found any sign of Cindy Fadro or Erin Martinelli. The last time they managed to ping Cindy’s phone via satellite, it had registered a mile up the slope from the house, but they never managed to recover the device. Tracking dogs refused to go near the house and seemed to lose all scent once they left the property boundaries. No trace of Erin was discovered, and no DNA could be found in either of the girls’ rooms to point to a culprit. One of the searchers claimed he had heard what sounded like a female voice screaming for help on the northern slope, but he wasn’t sure where it had come from, and no one else could verify it. Another man claimed he saw someone walking inside the tree line near the eastern edge of the property but never got a good glimpse at their face to see who they were. With all speculation bereft of evidence, it seemed to everyone that both Cindy and Erin had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Worse yet, when I described my account to the sheriff, he informed me that his team hadn’t found any symbols painted on the walls, nor did they see anything out of the ordinary. All they found that aligned with my story was the strange, overwhelming aroma of roses that permeated the house.

Nothing more.

That was six weeks ago. I got out of the clinic within a few days after the event, but the continued search efforts proved fruitless. With their investigation coming up cold, the sheriff’s office released the house back to Mr. Watkins, who closed it indefinitely. I had never seen him so distraught in my life, as Ed took the girls’ disappearance rather hard. He felt personally responsible, though we all knew there wasn’t anything he could have done, especially since no one knew what happened to Erin or Cindy. However, Ed apparently decided to go there himself late one evening to do some looking around the house and didn’t bother to tell anyone else. It wasn’t until his cleaning lady stopped by his cottage in Jacob’s Fork the next morning that Ed was reported missing, and police dispatched to the Wickenshire House.

They never found him.

His car was parked out front, the doors unlocked, but they couldn’t find a trace of Edward Watkins anywhere on the property. I helped with the search, as I basically slept in the sheriff’s office these days, and found no sign of a struggle or any other foul play, only the smell of roses. We dug deep this time, rifled through local records, archives, property history, everything we could get our hands on about the estate. There was nothing to indicate this place would be trouble, no forgotten building plans with hidden rooms, no land disputes with older tenants, no tribal issues from burial grounds or holy sites. The property was normal, and even when I poked around to see if there had been any deaths, suicides, or other sordid affairs associated with the house, my search came up blank. There was no reason for this to be happen, not from human effort, or anything else.

Even now, as December drags on, nothing has been the same. No plants grow in the burned zone, not even the smallest patch of liken or moss, as if the ground is poisoned to its core. Animals avoid it, so that the uncharred sections of forest around the property are empty, silent places. The access road is chained off to keep curious locals away, and Sheriff Kowolski let me bunk at a small ranger cabin at the base of the mountain just so I could keep tabs on the place. I think he knew I needed to be close, to keep an eye on the house, and keep looking for answers. I can’t explain why, but I know something is in there, waiting, biding its time. It failed to get me that night, but I have a terrible premonition that it doesn’t need *me*.

It just needs *more*.

I’ve found markers in the last few days. Piles of bones. Not haphazard from an animal kill, but stacked, organized, purposeful. Bits of twine made from plant fibers hold them together, and despite being in the open, no animals will bother them, not even the vultures. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, they think I can’t process the girls being gone, but I’ve stumbled on over a dozen of them now. They seemed to be set in a wide ring around the property line, spanning outward from the house into the forest beyond, capturing more territory by the day. No matter how many times I remove them, the piles always reappear, with fresh bones added to the stacks. I don’t touch them anymore, and I don’t even make eye contact with the empty eye sockets of the skulls. The few times I have, I heard whispers in my sleep, and had nightmares of eyes in the shadows of my room.

Some of the bones are like those of a rabbit or mole, while others are bigger like elk or bear. Every pile is topped with a skull, most of them from small game, but five of the piles hold unique skulls; a bear, a coyote, an eagle, a snake, and lastly, a great bull elk. They are laid out opposite one another ringing the house, the rest of the smaller markers ranging from them into the forest beyond. Of all the markers, the one with the elk skull is tallest, its full spread of antlers still intact so that it is nine feet high at the eye sockets. I found a symbol painted onto the bone forehead with powdered charcoal that the rain never seems to wash away, no matter how many times I go up to it.

A spider.

One made of two slender, inverted hands, both the same size.

I’m posting this so that it’s on record, in case one of these days I don’t come back from that mountain. Service was always spotty up there before, but ever since that night, it’s been non-existent. Even the few trail cameras I’ve put out have either gone dead or produced nothing but blurry photos. Something is building these markers, watching me whenever I walk the perimeter, and shifting in the corners of my vision whenever I turn my head. I’ve discovered trail signs that have been purposefully moved to misdirect me. Sometimes I hear screams in the woods, distant and warped, but they sound like Erin’s cries. I see flashes of blonde hair in the bushes that I want to believe is Cindy, but I know it can’t be.

They’re gone, both of them.

Only the sheriff understands, even if he doesn’t say much to that effect. I can see it in his eyes, he knows that I’m telling the truth, and his own deputies have been up to the house to see the piles multiple times. There’s nothing they can do, nothing but wait from the valley below and hope that the snow buries whatever it is for the winter.

There’s something wrong with the Wickenshire House, something *inside* it, something unseen that walks the grounds day and night. It wants more than the estate, I can feel it, can taste it in the wind, hear it in the dry crunch of snow under my boots, and feel it in the shivers I get every time I look at the dark, barren windows of that cursed structure.

It wants the forest, the trees, the mountain.

It wants *everything*.",7,1765832850.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1pnizlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1pnizlk/aio_for_feeling_betrayed/,AIO for feeling betrayed?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I (24M) moved to a new city for work about a year and a half ago. Pretty early on, I became really good friends with two women I’ll call Sarah and Jess (both supposedly 33F at the time). They told me they were married with kids, had moved here leaving their families behind for this job opportunity, and didn’t have a car. Since I drive to the office anyway, I started giving them rides every day morning and evening. We’d chat the whole way, grab lunch together, hang out outside work sometimes. They genuinely became two of my closest friends in this new place. I have a girlfriend who I’m very happy with, so this was 100% platonic.

Because they were “33, married, with kids,” I naturally treated them with a certain kind of respect. I saw them as older, more mature, basically like big-sister/mentor figures. I was the “kid” in the group (I literally am the youngest in our team), so I’d listen to their advice more seriously, defer to them on decisions, share stuff about my life but always with that mental filter of “they’re almost 10 years ahead of me, in a totally different life stage.” I’d hold doors, pay for coffee more often, all the small respectful stuff you do when you think someone’s significantly older and more experienced. 

Fast forward to a couple days. Somehow the truth comes out: they’re actually both 26. Not married. No kids. Never have been.

Apparently, they faked parts of their resumes (including age and marital status) to seem more “stable” and get hired. I totally get why they did that initially—job market is brutal, and some companies are weirdly biased toward people who look “settled.” But they kept the lie going with everyone at work, including me, for over a year even after we became super close friends.

They say they’ve been “wanting to tell me for a long time” but were scared, and it just never felt like the right moment. Now that it’s out, I’m honestly really upset. Not because they’re 26 (cool, whatever), but because:

I treated them completely differently than I would have if I’d known the truth. I gave them a level of deference and respect that was based on a false premise they knew about the whole time.  

I haven’t blown up at them or anything I just pulled back a bit to process. But I feel kind of stupid and betrayed. Like a lot of our dynamic over the past year now feels fake in hindsight.

They seem genuinely sorry and say they didn’t mean to hurt me, but I’m struggling to get past it. Am I overreacting? Am I the asshole for feeling like this lie changes how I see the entire friendship? Or is it reasonable to be pissed that they let me operate under false information for so long, especially when it directly affected how I treated them?",2,1765832817.0,AIO,2,0.75,False

1pniyt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pniyt6/theres_something_wrong_with_the_wickenshire_house/,There's something wrong with the Wickenshire House.,"The blaring of my cellphone jolted me awake, and I sat up with a groan.

*Getting too old for this.*

In front of my ragged couch, the TV continued with its black and white parade of old footage from a World War One documentary, though the war seemed nearly over now. Judging by the digital clock on the mantelpiece, which read 3:49 AM, I’d been asleep for at least five hours. My body ached, a familiar problem at my age, but enough that I chided myself for not going to bed earlier like a responsible person. It had been a long day, so I came home to a cold shower, a few hot dogs warmed in the microwave and settled down to watch some television before bed. Of course, at 55 years old I’d misjudged how tired I really was and spent close to half the night slumped on my sofa, which meant I would be paying for it in the morning with stiff joints and a sore back.

Palming my cracked Motorola from the coffee table, I found the TV remote and hit the *mute* button as I answered the call. “Hello?”

Shaky breathing grated on the other end, and after a few moments, a girl’s hushed voice whispered through. “Mr. Todd?”

Ice rippled through my veins at the sound of Cindy’s panicked voice, and I sat up straighter to rub at my bleary eyes. “Yeah, I’m here. You okay? What’s wrong?”

Silence greeted me, a strange mix of static, trembling breaths, and what sounded like sniffles as she tried to hold back tears. “Please . . . help me.”

“Cindy?” Concern building in my mind, I switched on a nearby lamp and pulled myself from the couch with a grunt at the tightness in my lower back. “You there? What’s going on?”

More shaky gasps followed, and just over the static, I thought I heard the faint sound of melodic humming in the background.

“Something’s wrong.” Cindy whispered, her words so quiet that they made each breath sound like cannon fire. “T-The woods are . . . something fell out of the sky and . . . it was so loud, it woke me up. There’s a fire.”

Brow furrowed, I moved fast for the kitchen, stumbling through the dark interior of my little cabin to grope for the light switch. “Stay calm, just stay calm and talk to me. You said there’s a fire? How far away? Can you get to your car?”

Another sniffle came through, clogged with harsh interference as the signal weakened, a sound that made my veins throb with tension. “I-I can’t. Something’s here, it’s in the house, it’s *in the house with me*. W-We can’t get out.”

My throat tried to close up, and I gulped hard against a wave of nausea. “Someone broke in? Are you hurt? Where’s Erin?”

A long pause, and in the background of the mute static, I could have sworn the humming sound cut out, as though whoever it was stopped their eerie melody all at once.

“She’s gone.” Something in Cindy’s tone changed, as if the fear drained away to a blank emotionless rasp, and the line went dead with a chilling *click.*

Every inch of my body racked with a shiver, and both feet seemed glued to the floor in a strange form of dread.

Like so many girls before them, Cindy Fadro and Erin Martinelli had been hired on to be caretakers and actors in the Wickenshire Living History Estate. Erin was 19, studying to be a nurse, while Cindy had just graduated high school and wanted to be a teacher. They were good kids, calm, intelligent, and great workers. Though I never had any children, they were like daughters of my own, and they even baked a cake for my birthday in June. Once they called me in for a leaky pipe, but only after they had done their best to fix it themselves with a tool kit I’d left in the stairwell cupboard. Smart little troopers that they were, the girls even had the common sense to shut the correct valve off and found the leak on their own. Had it been anyone else, I might have considered this to be a prank, a joke, some dumb idea made by bored kids to get a new video for their social media nonsense, but I knew Cindy and Erin.

They didn’t pull pranks like this.

Unnerved, I tried to redial her number but got no answer. Erin’s number yielded the same result, and I shook my head at myself.

*Screw it, I’m not taking any chances.*

I was midway through yanking my work boots on when the sheriff picked up.

*“Hello?”*

From the gruffness in his words, I could tell he’d been asleep as well, but I couldn’t waste time with the standard 911 procedures.

“David, it’s me.” I cinched down the laces on my boots and grabbed my Carhart jacket from its hook by the door. “Cindy just called from the Wickenshire place. There’s a fire on the mountain, and I think someone’s broken into the house. I’m headed there now.”

Rustling on the opposite end of the phone let me know David was up, likely going through the same motions as myself. The son of a Polish man and a Kootenai woman, David Kowolski and I had known each other since high school, and even played football on the same team. Nicknamed ‘White Cloud’ for his European features and Native American blood, he was stubborn with a quick temper, but tenacious when it came to his job. As a law man he drove his deputies relentlessly, backed them to the hilt when it came to any court battles, and as a result he’d managed to keep the crime in Jacob’s Fork quite low over the years. We didn’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I knew I could count on him when it came to something like this. If Cindy or Erin were in danger, Sheriff Kowolski would ride through hell and back to get them out, which was exactly the kind of man I needed right now.

*“I’ll get on the horn to a few of my boys and have them meet you there.”* He replied, and I heard the zipping of a coat on his end, along with the metallic *cha-click* of a handgun slide being racked. *“Fire teams are going to need time to get spun up, so whatever happens, don’t go wandering off without letting me know. Last thing I want is us getting caught in the flames if they decide to move down the mountain.”*

I nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see me and kept the phone pressed to my ear as I swiped my truck keys from the porcelain ashtray near the front door. “Got it.”

*“Be careful, Andy.”* His voice hitched in a low pause, as if the sheriff himself had as bad a feeling about this as I did, and he hung up.

Rain pattered on the windshield of my ancient pickup truck as I wound my way through the dark backroads of northern Idaho, the night sky black with the clouds of late fall. On the sun-faded seat next to me lay my work kit; a simple heavy duty canvas tool bag that held various tools, keys, a flashlight, and an old revolver handed down to me from my grandfather. I used the tools in my job every day as the groundskeeper, janitor, and fix-it-all handyman for the Wickenshire House, which had been part of our small town for as long as anyone could remember. Set on a picturesque 103 acres of fields and woodland in the shadow of the nearby Smoke Point Mountain, the Wickenshire House was a rare example of eastern architecture in the far reaches of the American West. It was the property of our town’s oldest resident, Mr. Edward J. Watkins, a kindly if forgetful soul who’d seen 91 years on this earth and still could drive his own car, though he had a little trouble with stairs. He lived in a cottage on the western edge of town, but I wasn’t about to call him at this time of night, even for something so urgent. Knowing Ed Watkins, he would try to drive out to the house with his slippers on and get hurt stumbling around in the flames.

*Or run into whatever scumbag is in the house, God forbid.*

On the horizon, some of the clouds began to glow, an orange flicker that widened on the mountainside as the distant fire spread. I could barely glimpse an odd plume of smoke in the sky, not curved upward from the fire but downward in a long arc, backlit by the flames. Looking at it, I had a momentary lapse of courage, my resolve wavering. Cindy had said something ‘fell from the sky’. This looked like a trail of some kind, maybe a crashed plane or a fallen weather balloon. If there was jet fuel on the ground, the fire would be even worse to put out than usual. It was horrible, rotten luck all the way around; a wildfire on the same night the house had its first break in, while the girls were there alone.

Adrenaline pumping, I sped up the lonely gravel trail to the house, one of the final sections of public roadways that got this close to the mountain. The Wickenshire House reared from the gloom ahead, its tall gates and Victorian gables illuminated by the dual halos of my truck’s headlights. It still took my breath away, the ornate beauty of the place, built as if every stone had been placed by a perfectionist’s hand. It stood at two stories in height, built from stone mined at the local quarry, with multiple chimneys, a balcony overlooking the back garden, and a grand front porch that wrapped halfway around the entire structure. A stone wall encircled the main grounds, with a wrought iron gate at the drive and several ornamental gardens interspersed throughout. Plush lawns stretched in between, and there were a few oak trees planted there for their brilliant colors in the fall. A small garage had been built around the back of the house sometime in the 1960’s, but this mainly held the riding lawnmower and a small shop where I did most of my repair work. Cindy and Erins’ cars were parked back there, the front gravel lot reserved for visitors during the daily tours. I didn’t see any other vehicle that the intruder might have used, but something else caught my attention in that moment, and held it with a pull like gravity.

*Lord have mercy.*

I stared, slack jawed, at a huge sea of flames that roared through the nearby trees with a voracious appetite. The fire hadn’t wasted any time, chewing through the wet growth as if the rain had never fell, evergreens crackling as they burned to dust in minutes. The heat came through my windshield in a steady increase, warm enough that I couldn’t tell the difference between the fire and my truck heater. The open grassy slopes around the house were consumed as the flames inched closer to the building, and fire closed in from both east and west.

Bounding from my truck, I dashed up to the front door and pulled the handles.

The polished brass knobs rattled but didn’t turn, the flames licking their way across the prairie grass outside the ornate courtyard walls.

*Locked. That means our scumbag didn’t break in through here. Maybe he went around the back?*

With shaking hands, I put down the canvas tool bag and dug in it for my key ring.

Sirens began to wail in the distance, and I finally managed to force the doors open, leaving the keys in the lock to snatch my aged pistol.

“Cindy!” I produced a flashlight with my left hand to hold it beneath my gun, and swept the beam of it over the murky interior. “Erin! Where are you?”

I’d been in the house countless times over the years, but in that moment it felt suffocating, like a great stony maw waiting for me to go far enough in so as to swallow me whole. The foyer led to a large room with a grand staircase, doorways on either side opening to the main dining room and a sitting room respectively. Signs and velvet ropes were posted to guide visitors through the proper areas, a gift shop in the rear of the house near the old parlor, along with guest bathrooms added on to the original back porch. With all the lights off, it looked alien, surreal for this part of the country with its eastern Victorian mystique, and my skin prickled at the sensation that there were eyes in every shadow. Of course, I had been stupid to yell. I’d let my panic get the better of me, and now I had given away the element of surprise. If some creep was in the house somewhere with Erin or Cindy, doing God-knows-what, I wouldn’t be able to sneak up on him now.

*Alright then, might as well move fast.*

With the old revolver grasped in my trembling hands, I headed for the stairs and took them three at a time. The wood creaked under my steps, ancient chestnut and oak that had been sawn before the Great Depression, each footfall like a cannon in the silent house. From here, the roar of the fire outside seemed a muffled whisper, as though there were two different realities, and the house stood guard between them. However, I remembered the heat coming through the windshield of my pickup and knew I didn’t have much time. Soon the house would be in flames, the fire outside enough to melt glass and ignite the wooden siding in minutes.

I reached the top of the stairs and swept my flashlight beam down both ends of the corridor at the top, uncertain of which direction to go first. Cindy and Erin were roomed down the hall to the left, but if someone had indeed broken into the house, Cindy might have hid somewhere else. Every second wasted could mean life or death, and I realized that either way, I’d be turning my back to the unknown.

Something flickered in the beam of my light, a brief whisp of shadow that jerked back behind the far corner of the right-side hallway. I didn’t have more than a moment to see clear details, but there was enough of an image burned into my mind that it came to me in a cold rush.

A face.

*Kowolski, you’d better get here soon.*

Swallowing, I paced down the hallway, my handgun leveled on the spot where the shadow had been.

Upon reaching it, I inched in a wide arc around the corner, bracing for a figure to jump out at me.

The air caught in my throat, and I stared at a section of wallpaper bathed in the aura of my flashlight.

Brownish-black sludge had been daubed on the wall, smeared into a perfect circle so that the excess dripped over the wallpaper like ebony tears. I couldn’t tell if it was mud, blood, or something else, but the corridor stank of rot and the putrid scent of stagnant water. Thorny bits of twig had been woven together, tied here and there with bits of plant fiber to form a circle that overlaid the sludge. Pasted together on the wall, these seemed to make up a protective ring, and in the middle were the handprints.

From what I could see, they were two different sizes, slender fingers and narrow palms indicating two younger females. Both prints faced downwards, slightly overlapping each other at the heel of the palm, and the thumbs arced toward one another like pincers. Unlike the grimy sludge, these were pressed to the old wallpaper in an unmistakable red hue, and it hit me what I was looking at.

*A spider.*

The four fingers of each hand made the legs, the thumbs its mandibles. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the blackness of the outer paste came from petals . . . rose petals to be exact. There were no roses growing in Idaho this time of year, and I’d never seen a natural black rose in my life, yet these appeared fresh. Most had been ground to a powder that gave the foul substance its dark color, others pushed into the muck like decorative flair, giving a strange, heady undertone to the mixture. With this discovery came more clarity; the thorny twigs glued into the circle were not random. They spread inward toward the spider, forming a sharp web of spikes that enshrined it, with the careful touch of an artisan. Such a display would have taken hours to make, certainly longer than the time it took for Cindy to call me. How was this possible?

*“Mr. Todd!”*

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the horrific cry echoing from somewhere behind me, Cindy’s voice tinged in pain and fear.

No sooner had I turned, running a short distance back toward the main corridor at the top of the stairs, and the voice cut out with a high, agonized scream.

“Cindy!” I charged toward the girls’ rooms, heart pounding in my chest.

*“Help me!”* Back in the direction of the symbol, Erin’s voice rang out, choked with sobs and full of torment. *“Mr. Todd, please!”*

Acidic bewilderment slithered through my mind, and I skidded to a stop, caught in the middle of the hallway, the staircase just to my left. I had been so close, perhaps a door away from Erin only moments ago. Could there be more than one intruder holding the girls in separate rooms?

*Cindy is closest. I have to get to her. She sounds like she’s hurt.*

Teeth gritted against the screams of Erin, I forced myself through the left side hallway, her voice ringing in my ears as she begged for my help.

At the end of the hall, I reached the rooms given to the girls and lunged for the handle to Cindy’s.

It didn’t turn, locked from the inside.

Backing up, I drove the heel of my boot into the door next to the lock and heard the old wood splinter. Any other time, I would have balked at such destruction, these doors being over 80 years old, but it didn’t matter anymore. What the fire didn’t get would not be worth Cindy or Erin’s lives.

The door swung open to slap against the bedroom wall, and I dashed inside, revolver in hand.

*What the . . .*

Within the quiet interior of the bedroom, everything looked untouched, the curtains partially open, the bed rumpled from where Cindy had gotten up to check the window, a discarded work uniform in the clothes hamper by the door. Dark stained wood trim lined the walls, windows, and doorway, the walls papered with a robin egg blue pattern that gave it an airy feeling. The white lacy curtains wafted like clouds in the slight draft that came in the open hallway door, and the vintage hot water heater gurgled in the corner as steam worked its way through the pipes. There were modern touches as well, more lamps and lights plugged into the discreet electrical outlets in the walls, a small television on its stand across from the bed, and a side door opened to a shared bathroom between Cindy’s room and Erin’s. This room wasn’t open to tourists, as it was the private living quarters for our workers, so such things were permissible here, as opposed to other parts of the house. Nothing seemed out of place, but there was no sign of Cindy anywhere, no clues to indicate that she’d been there moments ago. It was as if she’d gotten out of bed, looked out the window, and vanished into thin air.

In a flurry of movement, I checked under the bed, in the closet, and the bathroom. When those came back clean, I broke through the bathroom door into Erin’s room, only to find more of the same.

There was no sign of the girls anywhere.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* Erin’s screams continued from the opposite end of the long corridor, and I flung open the bedroom door to retrace my mad dash in her direction, confusion and frustration mounting.

Rounding the corner that bore the strange mark on the wall, I swayed to a stop on the old floorboards next to the door where her screams had come from and yanked on the knob.

*You’ve got to be kidding me . . . how many doors did they lock before I got here?*

With a gasp of exertion, I backed up to kick the door in like the last one, muscles tensed for the effort.

*“Mr. Todd!”* Cindy’s cries exploded from the doorway behind me, rabid and intense as the door rattles on its hinges like she was throwing herself against it from within the room.

I froze, staring at the door, heart racing as my mind whirled. How could she be in there? I’d heard Cindy on the other side of the house not five minutes ago. There was no way she could have moved that fast, not without going past me. I would have seen her in the hall, would have heard the ancient doors creaking on their hinges as they opened.

She couldn’t be in there.

*“Please, help me!”* Erin’s screams started up again, but this time from somewhere in the left-side hallway, and another door began to groan in muted *thuds* as if she too were trying to break it down.

A dry fear crept into my throat, different than what I’d known coming into the house. This didn’t make sense. Erin’s voice had been coming from the door I stood ready to break into, but now it was to my left. Cindy’s had been coming from her room in the west wing but now called from the door behind me. Neither could have left their respective rooms without entering the hall, and I knew for a fact that there weren’t any old-fashioned servant entrances anywhere that could have let them move unnoticed. Something was wrong, very wrong.

Shaken, I took a step away from the door that echoed with Cindy’s voice. “Cindy?”

*“Mr. Todd!”* She begged from the other side of the oak planking, the wood slamming against the jam with wild urgency. *“Please, help me! Please!”*

“The door is locked.” I tried not to hyperventilate as I watched the knob rattle in its socket, knowing fully well the lock was on her side of the door. “Can you let me in?”

Her wails increased in pitch, the screeches an awful combination of agony and terror that made my stomach churn. It sounded as if Cindy was being tormented in the worst ways imaginable, but something about the cadence of each shriek felt off, enough that my brain sent up warning alarms inside my skull.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* She pleaded once more, the same words both girls kept using in various rearrangements over and over, the door shuddering under each blow she made.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I sucked in a breath, eyes focused on the doorknob as it clacked back-and-forth, like Cindy wanted to open it but couldn’t. An uncanny thought rose in my mind, bone-chilling in its clarity, growing louder and louder so that it burst from me before I could stop it.

“Cindy,” I gripped my flashlight so hard that my knuckles turned white. “What’s my first name?”

Like a thunderclap, Cindy’s pleas ceased, along with Erin’s, so that the entire house fell into dead silence. Nothing moved, and even the muffled roar of the wildfire outside seemed deadened further than before, as though the house was a vacuum of sound. My skin crawled, the air thick in my lungs, and a strange certainty took hold of me that made the sense of dread even worse as Cindy’s words about Erin trickled through my brain.

*She’s gone.*

*Click.*

To my right, a doorknob at the far end of the hallway unlocked.

*Click.*

Another lock slid open, this one closer, the doors remaining shut as more joined them one-by-one.

*Click.*

*Click.*

*Click.*

A twinge of panic tightened in my throat, but I leveled the beam of my flashlight at the first door that had unlocked, blood surging in my temples. Everything seemed loud, the heartbeat in my chest, the breath in my lungs, the groan of the floorboards under my boots. My vision narrowed, a vibration hummed to life inside my skull, and I tasted metal on my tongue. In my hand, the flashlight began to flicker as if the batteries were struggling to remain lit, and I couldn’t lift the revolver, my arms refusing to move like the gun weighed as much as a car.

The locks carried on past me, every door on the second story unlocking itself in a continuous march, until at last, the final *click* resounded from the far hallway like cannon fire to my ears.

For a moment, the silence returned, so thick it may as well have been water.

*Wham.*

Every door on the second story flung open, impacting against the wall inside their respective rooms so hard that I heard plaster *crunch*, the hinges squealing on old dust.

With them came the screams.

There were hundreds of voices, some human, others less so, bellowing at the top of their lungs to be heard over one another. If they were saying any words, they were lost among the throng, a constant roar of vocals that soured in my ears for the sheer volume of it. Somewhere among the morass, I could barely catch the sound of Erin and Cindy’s voices shrieking with the others, a morbid choir of pain, suffering, and fear. It seemed to seep out of the floorboards, ooze from the heater vents, and rebound off the walls in every direction. With the doors open, the deep orange glow of the flames outside poured into the house like a tidal wave, but oddly enough no heat came with it, the hallway as cold as if I’d stepped into a freezer. The shadows elongated in the firelight, swaying as they inched up the papered walls, and a pungent smell followed them.

Roses.

It came with overpowering strength, sickly-sweet, but unmistakable. As the tide of shadows advanced down the hall toward me, the fermented stink of roses filled the air like poison gas, and I tasted copper on my lips.

*I have to get out of here.*

Coughing on the blood running from both nostrils, I stumbled toward the stairs, my head a mess of static. Like a tide of slithering vines, the inky shadows pursued me with ravenous hunger. I could feel their magnetic pull, the chorus of screams still ringing across the house with deafening volume, a terrible siren song that tugged at something deep within my subconscious. Voices, so many voices, begged me to stay, to go back, to find the darkest room and sink myself into the abyss until it drowned me.

Something tightened on my ankle just as I reached the top of the staircase, and I toppled headlong down the steps.

*Bam.*

My hip rammed into a banister, and I lost my grip on the pistol.

*Wham.*

Another step hit my shoulder, and I felt my teeth bite into my tongue, the flashlight clattering away into the floor below.

*Smack.*

My head connected with the floorboards at the landing, and the blackness threatened to close over my eyes for the last time.

*Creak.*

One of the steps flexed under the weight of a foot, and I gulped air in pain to squint at the shadows.

*Creak.*

Another footstep echoed toward me, something at the top of the steps descending with a slow, methodical gait. It didn’t sound heavy, not the deft pace of a large man or thick boot, but almost delicate, light, graceful. Yet, there was something about each carefully placed step, each sigh and squeak of the aged woodwork that made my skin wriggle. Something was coming, something that knew exactly where I was even in the pitch blackness of the house.

It was watching me, *stalking* me through the shadows like a cat with a mouse.

Desperate fear surged in my brain, and I clawed through the dark on my stomach to find a way out. I last remembered the front door being nearby, but it seemed to take an eternity to move across the cold floorboards, the unseen presence mere yards behind me as I wriggled forward.

At last, I managed to gain my footing, though it hurt to put weight on my right leg, and hurled myself forward in the blind shadows.

*Thud.*

Both front doors flew open, and I tumbled out onto the porch, rolling down the steps into the stones of the walkway.

Like a switch had been thrown, the world seemed to come alive once more, the cold sensation fading, the sound returning. Sirens wailed closer as headlights appeared in the long gravel driveway, and the crackle of flames roared from the trees. Smoke filled my nostrils, heat from the nearby fire licked over my skin, and I rolled onto my side to look back toward the house.

My lungs tightened, and I stared, unable to pull my eyes away.

Inside the open front doorway, nothing was visible, not the glint of firelight from inside, nor the faint glow of it coming through any ground windows. The entrance was a mass of impenetrable shadows that seemed to form a solid wall at the threshold, yet deep within that abyss, something stared back.

It had no shape, no form that I could identify it with, but there was definitely a presence that stood just beyond the light, watching me from the gloom. My eyes seemed fastened to it, either by my own primordial fear, or perhaps willed so by whatever peered out of the wretched expanse. A torrent of emotions ripped through my mind, warped and misshapen, like cold fingers pried at the taps of my humanity to unleash a maelstrom of feeling. Hunger and fear. Hate and despair. Lust and sadness. Grief and pain. They all rolled over one another, tumbling in and out of each other in a never-ending tide, and it hit me with a strangled form of clarity that these weren’t *my* emotions.

Locked in place by the unknown being’s gaze, I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as cry out, my only option to fight back with what little expression I had left.

*What are you?*

Something about my terrified thought seemed to strike a chord within the cascade of terrible shadow, for the next instant the doors on the house creaked in their wrought-iron hinges, and then swung shut on their own.

The rest of the night was a blur, a stupor, one that I wandered through in a mindless fog. Firefighting crews appeared from miles around to help put out the blaze, but not before it chewed through all 103 acres on the Wickenshire estate. Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was burned to cinders. Even boulders cracked from the intense heat, the smoke pall so large it could be seen from Montana, or so I heard. One of the fire trucks exploded when its fuel tank caught fire and killed three men. Everything burned . . . except the house.

For some reason, the fire stopped at the stone courtyard walls and went no further. In a blaze hot enough that it had turned some minor sandpits on the mountain to crude glass, there wasn’t so much as a scorch mark on the house or its outbuildings. None of the paint peeled, the siding wasn’t so much as warm to the touch, and all the plants withing the yard were unscathed. The investigators couldn’t even find ash on the roof from the fire afterwards, not a single flake. Unlike its ruined acreage, the Wickenshire House had survived the wildfire unharmed, and no one could make any sense of it.

Once the fire was finally put out, they took me to the local clinic for my injuries, a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and a concussion from my tumble down the stairs. Sheriff Kowolski visited in the morning to see how I was, and to fill me in on what I’d missed once they trucked me away from the site.

Over three hundred search and rescue volunteers had been called out, along with special forensics teams from neighboring counties, and they hadn’t found any sign of Cindy Fadro or Erin Martinelli. The last time they managed to ping Cindy’s phone via satellite, it had registered a mile up the slope from the house, but they never managed to recover the device. Tracking dogs refused to go near the house and seemed to lose all scent once they left the property boundaries. No trace of Erin was discovered, and no DNA could be found in either of the girls’ rooms to point to a culprit. One of the searchers claimed he had heard what sounded like a female voice screaming for help on the northern slope, but he wasn’t sure where it had come from, and no one else could verify it. Another man claimed he saw someone walking inside the tree line near the eastern edge of the property but never got a good glimpse at their face to see who they were. With all speculation bereft of evidence, it seemed to everyone that both Cindy and Erin had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Worse yet, when I described my account to the sheriff, he informed me that his team hadn’t found any symbols painted on the walls, nor did they see anything out of the ordinary. All they found that aligned with my story was the strange, overwhelming aroma of roses that permeated the house.

Nothing more.

That was six weeks ago. I got out of the clinic within a few days after the event, but the continued search efforts proved fruitless. With their investigation coming up cold, the sheriff’s office released the house back to Mr. Watkins, who closed it indefinitely. I had never seen him so distraught in my life, as Ed took the girls’ disappearance rather hard. He felt personally responsible, though we all knew there wasn’t anything he could have done, especially since no one knew what happened to Erin or Cindy. However, Ed apparently decided to go there himself late one evening to do some looking around the house and didn’t bother to tell anyone else. It wasn’t until his cleaning lady stopped by his cottage in Jacob’s Fork the next morning that Ed was reported missing, and police dispatched to the Wickenshire House.

They never found him.

His car was parked out front, the doors unlocked, but they couldn’t find a trace of Edward Watkins anywhere on the property. I helped with the search, as I basically slept in the sheriff’s office these days, and found no sign of a struggle or any other foul play, only the smell of roses. We dug deep this time, rifled through local records, archives, property history, everything we could get our hands on about the estate. There was nothing to indicate this place would be trouble, no forgotten building plans with hidden rooms, no land disputes with older tenants, no tribal issues from burial grounds or holy sites. The property was normal, and even when I poked around to see if there had been any deaths, suicides, or other sordid affairs associated with the house, my search came up blank. There was no reason for this to be happen, not from human effort, or anything else.

Even now, as December drags on, nothing has been the same. No plants grow in the burned zone, not even the smallest patch of liken or moss, as if the ground is poisoned to its core. Animals avoid it, so that the uncharred sections of forest around the property are empty, silent places. The access road is chained off to keep curious locals away, and Sheriff Kowolski let me bunk at a small ranger cabin at the base of the mountain just so I could keep tabs on the place. I think he knew I needed to be close, to keep an eye on the house, and keep looking for answers. I can’t explain why, but I know something is in there, waiting, biding its time. It failed to get me that night, but I have a terrible premonition that it doesn’t need *me*.

It just needs *more*.

I’ve found markers in the last few days. Piles of bones. Not haphazard from an animal kill, but stacked, organized, purposeful. Bits of twine made from plant fibers hold them together, and despite being in the open, no animals will bother them, not even the vultures. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, they think I can’t process the girls being gone, but I’ve stumbled on over a dozen of them now. They seemed to be set in a wide ring around the property line, spanning outward from the house into the forest beyond, capturing more territory by the day. No matter how many times I remove them, the piles always reappear, with fresh bones added to the stacks. I don’t touch them anymore, and I don’t even make eye contact with the empty eye sockets of the skulls. The few times I have, I heard whispers in my sleep, and had nightmares of eyes in the shadows of my room.

Some of the bones are like those of a rabbit or mole, while others are bigger like elk or bear. Every pile is topped with a skull, most of them from small game, but five of the piles hold unique skulls; a bear, a coyote, an eagle, a snake, and lastly, a great bull elk. They are laid out opposite one another ringing the house, the rest of the smaller markers ranging from them into the forest beyond. Of all the markers, the one with the elk skull is tallest, its full spread of antlers still intact so that it is nine feet high at the eye sockets. I found a symbol painted onto the bone forehead with powdered charcoal that the rain never seems to wash away, no matter how many times I go up to it.

A spider.

One made of two slender, inverted hands, both the same size.

I’m posting this so that it’s on record, in case one of these days I don’t come back from that mountain. Service was always spotty up there before, but ever since that night, it’s been non-existent. Even the few trail cameras I’ve put out have either gone dead or produced nothing but blurry photos. Something is building these markers, watching me whenever I walk the perimeter, and shifting in the corners of my vision whenever I turn my head. I’ve discovered trail signs that have been purposefully moved to misdirect me. Sometimes I hear screams in the woods, distant and warped, but they sound like Erin’s cries. I see flashes of blonde hair in the bushes that I want to believe is Cindy, but I know it can’t be.

They’re gone, both of them.

Only the sheriff understands, even if he doesn’t say much to that effect. I can see it in his eyes, he knows that I’m telling the truth, and his own deputies have been up to the house to see the piles multiple times. There’s nothing they can do, nothing but wait from the valley below and hope that the snow buries whatever it is for the winter.

There’s something wrong with the Wickenshire House, something *inside* it, something unseen that walks the grounds day and night. It wants more than the estate, I can feel it, can taste it in the wind, hear it in the dry crunch of snow under my boots, and feel it in the shivers I get every time I look at the dark, barren windows of that cursed structure.

It wants the forest, the trees, the mountain.

It wants *everything*.",1,1765832769.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

*Getting too old for this.*

In front of my ragged couch, the TV continued with its black and white parade of old footage from a World War One documentary, though the war seemed nearly over now. Judging by the digital clock on the mantelpiece, which read 3:49 AM, I’d been asleep for at least five hours. My body ached, a familiar problem at my age, but enough that I chided myself for not going to bed earlier like a responsible person. It had been a long day, so I came home to a cold shower, a few hot dogs warmed in the microwave and settled down to watch some television before bed. Of course, at 55 years old I’d misjudged how tired I really was and spent close to half the night slumped on my sofa, which meant I would be paying for it in the morning with stiff joints and a sore back.

Palming my cracked Motorola from the coffee table, I found the TV remote and hit the *mute* button as I answered the call. “Hello?”

Shaky breathing grated on the other end, and after a few moments, a girl’s hushed voice whispered through. “Mr. Todd?”

Ice rippled through my veins at the sound of Cindy’s panicked voice, and I sat up straighter to rub at my bleary eyes. “Yeah, I’m here. You okay? What’s wrong?”

Silence greeted me, a strange mix of static, trembling breaths, and what sounded like sniffles as she tried to hold back tears. “Please . . . help me.”

“Cindy?” Concern building in my mind, I switched on a nearby lamp and pulled myself from the couch with a grunt at the tightness in my lower back. “You there? What’s going on?”

More shaky gasps followed, and just over the static, I thought I heard the faint sound of melodic humming in the background.

“Something’s wrong.” Cindy whispered, her words so quiet that they made each breath sound like cannon fire. “T-The woods are . . . something fell out of the sky and . . . it was so loud, it woke me up. There’s a fire.”

Brow furrowed, I moved fast for the kitchen, stumbling through the dark interior of my little cabin to grope for the light switch. “Stay calm, just stay calm and talk to me. You said there’s a fire? How far away? Can you get to your car?”

Another sniffle came through, clogged with harsh interference as the signal weakened, a sound that made my veins throb with tension. “I-I can’t. Something’s here, it’s in the house, it’s *in the house with me*. W-We can’t get out.”

My throat tried to close up, and I gulped hard against a wave of nausea. “Someone broke in? Are you hurt? Where’s Erin?”

A long pause, and in the background of the mute static, I could have sworn the humming sound cut out, as though whoever it was stopped their eerie melody all at once.

“She’s gone.” Something in Cindy’s tone changed, as if the fear drained away to a blank emotionless rasp, and the line went dead with a chilling *click.*

Every inch of my body racked with a shiver, and both feet seemed glued to the floor in a strange form of dread.

Like so many girls before them, Cindy Fadro and Erin Martinelli had been hired on to be caretakers and actors in the Wickenshire Living History Estate. Erin was 19, studying to be a nurse, while Cindy had just graduated high school and wanted to be a teacher. They were good kids, calm, intelligent, and great workers. Though I never had any children, they were like daughters of my own, and they even baked a cake for my birthday in June. Once they called me in for a leaky pipe, but only after they had done their best to fix it themselves with a tool kit I’d left in the stairwell cupboard. Smart little troopers that they were, the girls even had the common sense to shut the correct valve off and found the leak on their own. Had it been anyone else, I might have considered this to be a prank, a joke, some dumb idea made by bored kids to get a new video for their social media nonsense, but I knew Cindy and Erin.

They didn’t pull pranks like this.

Unnerved, I tried to redial her number but got no answer. Erin’s number yielded the same result, and I shook my head at myself.

*Screw it, I’m not taking any chances.*

I was midway through yanking my work boots on when the sheriff picked up.

*“Hello?”*

From the gruffness in his words, I could tell he’d been asleep as well, but I couldn’t waste time with the standard 911 procedures.

“David, it’s me.” I cinched down the laces on my boots and grabbed my Carhart jacket from its hook by the door. “Cindy just called from the Wickenshire place. There’s a fire on the mountain, and I think someone’s broken into the house. I’m headed there now.”

Rustling on the opposite end of the phone let me know David was up, likely going through the same motions as myself. The son of a Polish man and a Kootenai woman, David Kowolski and I had known each other since high school, and even played football on the same team. Nicknamed ‘White Cloud’ for his European features and Native American blood, he was stubborn with a quick temper, but tenacious when it came to his job. As a law man he drove his deputies relentlessly, backed them to the hilt when it came to any court battles, and as a result he’d managed to keep the crime in Jacob’s Fork quite low over the years. We didn’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I knew I could count on him when it came to something like this. If Cindy or Erin were in danger, Sheriff Kowolski would ride through hell and back to get them out, which was exactly the kind of man I needed right now.

*“I’ll get on the horn to a few of my boys and have them meet you there.”* He replied, and I heard the zipping of a coat on his end, along with the metallic *cha-click* of a handgun slide being racked. *“Fire teams are going to need time to get spun up, so whatever happens, don’t go wandering off without letting me know. Last thing I want is us getting caught in the flames if they decide to move down the mountain.”*

I nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see me and kept the phone pressed to my ear as I swiped my truck keys from the porcelain ashtray near the front door. “Got it.”

*“Be careful, Andy.”* His voice hitched in a low pause, as if the sheriff himself had as bad a feeling about this as I did, and he hung up.

Rain pattered on the windshield of my ancient pickup truck as I wound my way through the dark backroads of northern Idaho, the night sky black with the clouds of late fall. On the sun-faded seat next to me lay my work kit; a simple heavy duty canvas tool bag that held various tools, keys, a flashlight, and an old revolver handed down to me from my grandfather. I used the tools in my job every day as the groundskeeper, janitor, and fix-it-all handyman for the Wickenshire House, which had been part of our small town for as long as anyone could remember. Set on a picturesque 103 acres of fields and woodland in the shadow of the nearby Smoke Point Mountain, the Wickenshire House was a rare example of eastern architecture in the far reaches of the American West. It was the property of our town’s oldest resident, Mr. Edward J. Watkins, a kindly if forgetful soul who’d seen 91 years on this earth and still could drive his own car, though he had a little trouble with stairs. He lived in a cottage on the western edge of town, but I wasn’t about to call him at this time of night, even for something so urgent. Knowing Ed Watkins, he would try to drive out to the house with his slippers on and get hurt stumbling around in the flames.

*Or run into whatever scumbag is in the house, God forbid.*

On the horizon, some of the clouds began to glow, an orange flicker that widened on the mountainside as the distant fire spread. I could barely glimpse an odd plume of smoke in the sky, not curved upward from the fire but downward in a long arc, backlit by the flames. Looking at it, I had a momentary lapse of courage, my resolve wavering. Cindy had said something ‘fell from the sky’. This looked like a trail of some kind, maybe a crashed plane or a fallen weather balloon. If there was jet fuel on the ground, the fire would be even worse to put out than usual. It was horrible, rotten luck all the way around; a wildfire on the same night the house had its first break in, while the girls were there alone.

Adrenaline pumping, I sped up the lonely gravel trail to the house, one of the final sections of public roadways that got this close to the mountain. The Wickenshire House reared from the gloom ahead, its tall gates and Victorian gables illuminated by the dual halos of my truck’s headlights. It still took my breath away, the ornate beauty of the place, built as if every stone had been placed by a perfectionist’s hand. It stood at two stories in height, built from stone mined at the local quarry, with multiple chimneys, a balcony overlooking the back garden, and a grand front porch that wrapped halfway around the entire structure. A stone wall encircled the main grounds, with a wrought iron gate at the drive and several ornamental gardens interspersed throughout. Plush lawns stretched in between, and there were a few oak trees planted there for their brilliant colors in the fall. A small garage had been built around the back of the house sometime in the 1960’s, but this mainly held the riding lawnmower and a small shop where I did most of my repair work. Cindy and Erins’ cars were parked back there, the front gravel lot reserved for visitors during the daily tours. I didn’t see any other vehicle that the intruder might have used, but something else caught my attention in that moment, and held it with a pull like gravity.

*Lord have mercy.*

I stared, slack jawed, at a huge sea of flames that roared through the nearby trees with a voracious appetite. The fire hadn’t wasted any time, chewing through the wet growth as if the rain had never fell, evergreens crackling as they burned to dust in minutes. The heat came through my windshield in a steady increase, warm enough that I couldn’t tell the difference between the fire and my truck heater. The open grassy slopes around the house were consumed as the flames inched closer to the building, and fire closed in from both east and west.

Bounding from my truck, I dashed up to the front door and pulled the handles.

The polished brass knobs rattled but didn’t turn, the flames licking their way across the prairie grass outside the ornate courtyard walls.

*Locked. That means our scumbag didn’t break in through here. Maybe he went around the back?*

With shaking hands, I put down the canvas tool bag and dug in it for my key ring.

Sirens began to wail in the distance, and I finally managed to force the doors open, leaving the keys in the lock to snatch my aged pistol.

“Cindy!” I produced a flashlight with my left hand to hold it beneath my gun, and swept the beam of it over the murky interior. “Erin! Where are you?”

I’d been in the house countless times over the years, but in that moment it felt suffocating, like a great stony maw waiting for me to go far enough in so as to swallow me whole. The foyer led to a large room with a grand staircase, doorways on either side opening to the main dining room and a sitting room respectively. Signs and velvet ropes were posted to guide visitors through the proper areas, a gift shop in the rear of the house near the old parlor, along with guest bathrooms added on to the original back porch. With all the lights off, it looked alien, surreal for this part of the country with its eastern Victorian mystique, and my skin prickled at the sensation that there were eyes in every shadow. Of course, I had been stupid to yell. I’d let my panic get the better of me, and now I had given away the element of surprise. If some creep was in the house somewhere with Erin or Cindy, doing God-knows-what, I wouldn’t be able to sneak up on him now.

*Alright then, might as well move fast.*

With the old revolver grasped in my trembling hands, I headed for the stairs and took them three at a time. The wood creaked under my steps, ancient chestnut and oak that had been sawn before the Great Depression, each footfall like a cannon in the silent house. From here, the roar of the fire outside seemed a muffled whisper, as though there were two different realities, and the house stood guard between them. However, I remembered the heat coming through the windshield of my pickup and knew I didn’t have much time. Soon the house would be in flames, the fire outside enough to melt glass and ignite the wooden siding in minutes.

I reached the top of the stairs and swept my flashlight beam down both ends of the corridor at the top, uncertain of which direction to go first. Cindy and Erin were roomed down the hall to the left, but if someone had indeed broken into the house, Cindy might have hid somewhere else. Every second wasted could mean life or death, and I realized that either way, I’d be turning my back to the unknown.

Something flickered in the beam of my light, a brief whisp of shadow that jerked back behind the far corner of the right-side hallway. I didn’t have more than a moment to see clear details, but there was enough of an image burned into my mind that it came to me in a cold rush.

A face.

*Kowolski, you’d better get here soon.*

Swallowing, I paced down the hallway, my handgun leveled on the spot where the shadow had been.

Upon reaching it, I inched in a wide arc around the corner, bracing for a figure to jump out at me.

The air caught in my throat, and I stared at a section of wallpaper bathed in the aura of my flashlight.

Brownish-black sludge had been daubed on the wall, smeared into a perfect circle so that the excess dripped over the wallpaper like ebony tears. I couldn’t tell if it was mud, blood, or something else, but the corridor stank of rot and the putrid scent of stagnant water. Thorny bits of twig had been woven together, tied here and there with bits of plant fiber to form a circle that overlaid the sludge. Pasted together on the wall, these seemed to make up a protective ring, and in the middle were the handprints.

From what I could see, they were two different sizes, slender fingers and narrow palms indicating two younger females. Both prints faced downwards, slightly overlapping each other at the heel of the palm, and the thumbs arced toward one another like pincers. Unlike the grimy sludge, these were pressed to the old wallpaper in an unmistakable red hue, and it hit me what I was looking at.

*A spider.*

The four fingers of each hand made the legs, the thumbs its mandibles. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the blackness of the outer paste came from petals . . . rose petals to be exact. There were no roses growing in Idaho this time of year, and I’d never seen a natural black rose in my life, yet these appeared fresh. Most had been ground to a powder that gave the foul substance its dark color, others pushed into the muck like decorative flair, giving a strange, heady undertone to the mixture. With this discovery came more clarity; the thorny twigs glued into the circle were not random. They spread inward toward the spider, forming a sharp web of spikes that enshrined it, with the careful touch of an artisan. Such a display would have taken hours to make, certainly longer than the time it took for Cindy to call me. How was this possible?

*“Mr. Todd!”*

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the horrific cry echoing from somewhere behind me, Cindy’s voice tinged in pain and fear.

No sooner had I turned, running a short distance back toward the main corridor at the top of the stairs, and the voice cut out with a high, agonized scream.

“Cindy!” I charged toward the girls’ rooms, heart pounding in my chest.

*“Help me!”* Back in the direction of the symbol, Erin’s voice rang out, choked with sobs and full of torment. *“Mr. Todd, please!”*

Acidic bewilderment slithered through my mind, and I skidded to a stop, caught in the middle of the hallway, the staircase just to my left. I had been so close, perhaps a door away from Erin only moments ago. Could there be more than one intruder holding the girls in separate rooms?

*Cindy is closest. I have to get to her. She sounds like she’s hurt.*

Teeth gritted against the screams of Erin, I forced myself through the left side hallway, her voice ringing in my ears as she begged for my help.

At the end of the hall, I reached the rooms given to the girls and lunged for the handle to Cindy’s.

It didn’t turn, locked from the inside.

Backing up, I drove the heel of my boot into the door next to the lock and heard the old wood splinter. Any other time, I would have balked at such destruction, these doors being over 80 years old, but it didn’t matter anymore. What the fire didn’t get would not be worth Cindy or Erin’s lives.

The door swung open to slap against the bedroom wall, and I dashed inside, revolver in hand.

*What the . . .*

Within the quiet interior of the bedroom, everything looked untouched, the curtains partially open, the bed rumpled from where Cindy had gotten up to check the window, a discarded work uniform in the clothes hamper by the door. Dark stained wood trim lined the walls, windows, and doorway, the walls papered with a robin egg blue pattern that gave it an airy feeling. The white lacy curtains wafted like clouds in the slight draft that came in the open hallway door, and the vintage hot water heater gurgled in the corner as steam worked its way through the pipes. There were modern touches as well, more lamps and lights plugged into the discreet electrical outlets in the walls, a small television on its stand across from the bed, and a side door opened to a shared bathroom between Cindy’s room and Erin’s. This room wasn’t open to tourists, as it was the private living quarters for our workers, so such things were permissible here, as opposed to other parts of the house. Nothing seemed out of place, but there was no sign of Cindy anywhere, no clues to indicate that she’d been there moments ago. It was as if she’d gotten out of bed, looked out the window, and vanished into thin air.

In a flurry of movement, I checked under the bed, in the closet, and the bathroom. When those came back clean, I broke through the bathroom door into Erin’s room, only to find more of the same.

There was no sign of the girls anywhere.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* Erin’s screams continued from the opposite end of the long corridor, and I flung open the bedroom door to retrace my mad dash in her direction, confusion and frustration mounting.

Rounding the corner that bore the strange mark on the wall, I swayed to a stop on the old floorboards next to the door where her screams had come from and yanked on the knob.

*You’ve got to be kidding me . . . how many doors did they lock before I got here?*

With a gasp of exertion, I backed up to kick the door in like the last one, muscles tensed for the effort.

*“Mr. Todd!”* Cindy’s cries exploded from the doorway behind me, rabid and intense as the door rattles on its hinges like she was throwing herself against it from within the room.

I froze, staring at the door, heart racing as my mind whirled. How could she be in there? I’d heard Cindy on the other side of the house not five minutes ago. There was no way she could have moved that fast, not without going past me. I would have seen her in the hall, would have heard the ancient doors creaking on their hinges as they opened.

She couldn’t be in there.

*“Please, help me!”* Erin’s screams started up again, but this time from somewhere in the left-side hallway, and another door began to groan in muted *thuds* as if she too were trying to break it down.

A dry fear crept into my throat, different than what I’d known coming into the house. This didn’t make sense. Erin’s voice had been coming from the door I stood ready to break into, but now it was to my left. Cindy’s had been coming from her room in the west wing but now called from the door behind me. Neither could have left their respective rooms without entering the hall, and I knew for a fact that there weren’t any old-fashioned servant entrances anywhere that could have let them move unnoticed. Something was wrong, very wrong.

Shaken, I took a step away from the door that echoed with Cindy’s voice. “Cindy?”

*“Mr. Todd!”* She begged from the other side of the oak planking, the wood slamming against the jam with wild urgency. *“Please, help me! Please!”*

“The door is locked.” I tried not to hyperventilate as I watched the knob rattle in its socket, knowing fully well the lock was on her side of the door. “Can you let me in?”

Her wails increased in pitch, the screeches an awful combination of agony and terror that made my stomach churn. It sounded as if Cindy was being tormented in the worst ways imaginable, but something about the cadence of each shriek felt off, enough that my brain sent up warning alarms inside my skull.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* She pleaded once more, the same words both girls kept using in various rearrangements over and over, the door shuddering under each blow she made.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I sucked in a breath, eyes focused on the doorknob as it clacked back-and-forth, like Cindy wanted to open it but couldn’t. An uncanny thought rose in my mind, bone-chilling in its clarity, growing louder and louder so that it burst from me before I could stop it.

“Cindy,” I gripped my flashlight so hard that my knuckles turned white. “What’s my first name?”

Like a thunderclap, Cindy’s pleas ceased, along with Erin’s, so that the entire house fell into dead silence. Nothing moved, and even the muffled roar of the wildfire outside seemed deadened further than before, as though the house was a vacuum of sound. My skin crawled, the air thick in my lungs, and a strange certainty took hold of me that made the sense of dread even worse as Cindy’s words about Erin trickled through my brain.

*She’s gone.*

*Click.*

To my right, a doorknob at the far end of the hallway unlocked.

*Click.*

Another lock slid open, this one closer, the doors remaining shut as more joined them one-by-one.

*Click.*

*Click.*

*Click.*

A twinge of panic tightened in my throat, but I leveled the beam of my flashlight at the first door that had unlocked, blood surging in my temples. Everything seemed loud, the heartbeat in my chest, the breath in my lungs, the groan of the floorboards under my boots. My vision narrowed, a vibration hummed to life inside my skull, and I tasted metal on my tongue. In my hand, the flashlight began to flicker as if the batteries were struggling to remain lit, and I couldn’t lift the revolver, my arms refusing to move like the gun weighed as much as a car.

The locks carried on past me, every door on the second story unlocking itself in a continuous march, until at last, the final *click* resounded from the far hallway like cannon fire to my ears.

For a moment, the silence returned, so thick it may as well have been water.

*Wham.*

Every door on the second story flung open, impacting against the wall inside their respective rooms so hard that I heard plaster *crunch*, the hinges squealing on old dust.

With them came the screams.

There were hundreds of voices, some human, others less so, bellowing at the top of their lungs to be heard over one another. If they were saying any words, they were lost among the throng, a constant roar of vocals that soured in my ears for the sheer volume of it. Somewhere among the morass, I could barely catch the sound of Erin and Cindy’s voices shrieking with the others, a morbid choir of pain, suffering, and fear. It seemed to seep out of the floorboards, ooze from the heater vents, and rebound off the walls in every direction. With the doors open, the deep orange glow of the flames outside poured into the house like a tidal wave, but oddly enough no heat came with it, the hallway as cold as if I’d stepped into a freezer. The shadows elongated in the firelight, swaying as they inched up the papered walls, and a pungent smell followed them.

Roses.

It came with overpowering strength, sickly-sweet, but unmistakable. As the tide of shadows advanced down the hall toward me, the fermented stink of roses filled the air like poison gas, and I tasted copper on my lips.

*I have to get out of here.*

Coughing on the blood running from both nostrils, I stumbled toward the stairs, my head a mess of static. Like a tide of slithering vines, the inky shadows pursued me with ravenous hunger. I could feel their magnetic pull, the chorus of screams still ringing across the house with deafening volume, a terrible siren song that tugged at something deep within my subconscious. Voices, so many voices, begged me to stay, to go back, to find the darkest room and sink myself into the abyss until it drowned me.

Something tightened on my ankle just as I reached the top of the staircase, and I toppled headlong down the steps.

*Bam.*

My hip rammed into a banister, and I lost my grip on the pistol.

*Wham.*

Another step hit my shoulder, and I felt my teeth bite into my tongue, the flashlight clattering away into the floor below.

*Smack.*

My head connected with the floorboards at the landing, and the blackness threatened to close over my eyes for the last time.

*Creak.*

One of the steps flexed under the weight of a foot, and I gulped air in pain to squint at the shadows.

*Creak.*

Another footstep echoed toward me, something at the top of the steps descending with a slow, methodical gait. It didn’t sound heavy, not the deft pace of a large man or thick boot, but almost delicate, light, graceful. Yet, there was something about each carefully placed step, each sigh and squeak of the aged woodwork that made my skin wriggle. Something was coming, something that knew exactly where I was even in the pitch blackness of the house.

It was watching me, *stalking* me through the shadows like a cat with a mouse.

Desperate fear surged in my brain, and I clawed through the dark on my stomach to find a way out. I last remembered the front door being nearby, but it seemed to take an eternity to move across the cold floorboards, the unseen presence mere yards behind me as I wriggled forward.

At last, I managed to gain my footing, though it hurt to put weight on my right leg, and hurled myself forward in the blind shadows.

*Thud.*

Both front doors flew open, and I tumbled out onto the porch, rolling down the steps into the stones of the walkway.

Like a switch had been thrown, the world seemed to come alive once more, the cold sensation fading, the sound returning. Sirens wailed closer as headlights appeared in the long gravel driveway, and the crackle of flames roared from the trees. Smoke filled my nostrils, heat from the nearby fire licked over my skin, and I rolled onto my side to look back toward the house.

My lungs tightened, and I stared, unable to pull my eyes away.

Inside the open front doorway, nothing was visible, not the glint of firelight from inside, nor the faint glow of it coming through any ground windows. The entrance was a mass of impenetrable shadows that seemed to form a solid wall at the threshold, yet deep within that abyss, something stared back.

It had no shape, no form that I could identify it with, but there was definitely a presence that stood just beyond the light, watching me from the gloom. My eyes seemed fastened to it, either by my own primordial fear, or perhaps willed so by whatever peered out of the wretched expanse. A torrent of emotions ripped through my mind, warped and misshapen, like cold fingers pried at the taps of my humanity to unleash a maelstrom of feeling. Hunger and fear. Hate and despair. Lust and sadness. Grief and pain. They all rolled over one another, tumbling in and out of each other in a never-ending tide, and it hit me with a strangled form of clarity that these weren’t *my* emotions.

Locked in place by the unknown being’s gaze, I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as cry out, my only option to fight back with what little expression I had left.

*What are you?*

Something about my terrified thought seemed to strike a chord within the cascade of terrible shadow, for the next instant the doors on the house creaked in their wrought-iron hinges, and then swung shut on their own.

The rest of the night was a blur, a stupor, one that I wandered through in a mindless fog. Firefighting crews appeared from miles around to help put out the blaze, but not before it chewed through all 103 acres on the Wickenshire estate. Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was burned to cinders. Even boulders cracked from the intense heat, the smoke pall so large it could be seen from Montana, or so I heard. One of the fire trucks exploded when its fuel tank caught fire and killed three men. Everything burned . . . except the house.

For some reason, the fire stopped at the stone courtyard walls and went no further. In a blaze hot enough that it had turned some minor sandpits on the mountain to crude glass, there wasn’t so much as a scorch mark on the house or its outbuildings. None of the paint peeled, the siding wasn’t so much as warm to the touch, and all the plants withing the yard were unscathed. The investigators couldn’t even find ash on the roof from the fire afterwards, not a single flake. Unlike its ruined acreage, the Wickenshire House had survived the wildfire unharmed, and no one could make any sense of it.

Once the fire was finally put out, they took me to the local clinic for my injuries, a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and a concussion from my tumble down the stairs. Sheriff Kowolski visited in the morning to see how I was, and to fill me in on what I’d missed once they trucked me away from the site.

Over three hundred search and rescue volunteers had been called out, along with special forensics teams from neighboring counties, and they hadn’t found any sign of Cindy Fadro or Erin Martinelli. The last time they managed to ping Cindy’s phone via satellite, it had registered a mile up the slope from the house, but they never managed to recover the device. Tracking dogs refused to go near the house and seemed to lose all scent once they left the property boundaries. No trace of Erin was discovered, and no DNA could be found in either of the girls’ rooms to point to a culprit. One of the searchers claimed he had heard what sounded like a female voice screaming for help on the northern slope, but he wasn’t sure where it had come from, and no one else could verify it. Another man claimed he saw someone walking inside the tree line near the eastern edge of the property but never got a good glimpse at their face to see who they were. With all speculation bereft of evidence, it seemed to everyone that both Cindy and Erin had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Worse yet, when I described my account to the sheriff, he informed me that his team hadn’t found any symbols painted on the walls, nor did they see anything out of the ordinary. All they found that aligned with my story was the strange, overwhelming aroma of roses that permeated the house.

Nothing more.

That was six weeks ago. I got out of the clinic within a few days after the event, but the continued search efforts proved fruitless. With their investigation coming up cold, the sheriff’s office released the house back to Mr. Watkins, who closed it indefinitely. I had never seen him so distraught in my life, as Ed took the girls’ disappearance rather hard. He felt personally responsible, though we all knew there wasn’t anything he could have done, especially since no one knew what happened to Erin or Cindy. However, Ed apparently decided to go there himself late one evening to do some looking around the house and didn’t bother to tell anyone else. It wasn’t until his cleaning lady stopped by his cottage in Jacob’s Fork the next morning that Ed was reported missing, and police dispatched to the Wickenshire House.

They never found him.

His car was parked out front, the doors unlocked, but they couldn’t find a trace of Edward Watkins anywhere on the property. I helped with the search, as I basically slept in the sheriff’s office these days, and found no sign of a struggle or any other foul play, only the smell of roses. We dug deep this time, rifled through local records, archives, property history, everything we could get our hands on about the estate. There was nothing to indicate this place would be trouble, no forgotten building plans with hidden rooms, no land disputes with older tenants, no tribal issues from burial grounds or holy sites. The property was normal, and even when I poked around to see if there had been any deaths, suicides, or other sordid affairs associated with the house, my search came up blank. There was no reason for this to be happen, not from human effort, or anything else.

Even now, as December drags on, nothing has been the same. No plants grow in the burned zone, not even the smallest patch of liken or moss, as if the ground is poisoned to its core. Animals avoid it, so that the uncharred sections of forest around the property are empty, silent places. The access road is chained off to keep curious locals away, and Sheriff Kowolski let me bunk at a small ranger cabin at the base of the mountain just so I could keep tabs on the place. I think he knew I needed to be close, to keep an eye on the house, and keep looking for answers. I can’t explain why, but I know something is in there, waiting, biding its time. It failed to get me that night, but I have a terrible premonition that it doesn’t need *me*.

It just needs *more*.

I’ve found markers in the last few days. Piles of bones. Not haphazard from an animal kill, but stacked, organized, purposeful. Bits of twine made from plant fibers hold them together, and despite being in the open, no animals will bother them, not even the vultures. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, they think I can’t process the girls being gone, but I’ve stumbled on over a dozen of them now. They seemed to be set in a wide ring around the property line, spanning outward from the house into the forest beyond, capturing more territory by the day. No matter how many times I remove them, the piles always reappear, with fresh bones added to the stacks. I don’t touch them anymore, and I don’t even make eye contact with the empty eye sockets of the skulls. The few times I have, I heard whispers in my sleep, and had nightmares of eyes in the shadows of my room.

Some of the bones are like those of a rabbit or mole, while others are bigger like elk or bear. Every pile is topped with a skull, most of them from small game, but five of the piles hold unique skulls; a bear, a coyote, an eagle, a snake, and lastly, a great bull elk. They are laid out opposite one another ringing the house, the rest of the smaller markers ranging from them into the forest beyond. Of all the markers, the one with the elk skull is tallest, its full spread of antlers still intact so that it is nine feet high at the eye sockets. I found a symbol painted onto the bone forehead with powdered charcoal that the rain never seems to wash away, no matter how many times I go up to it.

A spider.

One made of two slender, inverted hands, both the same size.

I’m posting this so that it’s on record, in case one of these days I don’t come back from that mountain. Service was always spotty up there before, but ever since that night, it’s been non-existent. Even the few trail cameras I’ve put out have either gone dead or produced nothing but blurry photos. Something is building these markers, watching me whenever I walk the perimeter, and shifting in the corners of my vision whenever I turn my head. I’ve discovered trail signs that have been purposefully moved to misdirect me. Sometimes I hear screams in the woods, distant and warped, but they sound like Erin’s cries. I see flashes of blonde hair in the bushes that I want to believe is Cindy, but I know it can’t be.

They’re gone, both of them.

Only the sheriff understands, even if he doesn’t say much to that effect. I can see it in his eyes, he knows that I’m telling the truth, and his own deputies have been up to the house to see the piles multiple times. There’s nothing they can do, nothing but wait from the valley below and hope that the snow buries whatever it is for the winter.

There’s something wrong with the Wickenshire House, something *inside* it, something unseen that walks the grounds day and night. It wants more than the estate, I can feel it, can taste it in the wind, hear it in the dry crunch of snow under my boots, and feel it in the shivers I get every time I look at the dark, barren windows of that cursed structure.

It wants the forest, the trees, the mountain.

It wants *everything*.",1,1765832604.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

1pniust,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1pniust/biliary_dyskinesia_story_22_ejection_fraction_no/,"Biliary Dyskinesia Story (22% Ejection Fraction, No Stones) – Lap Chole Scheduled for Dec 29","Hey everyone :) 37F here sharing my detailed biliary dyskinesia journey in hopes it helps others recognize similar symptoms or gain insight. I'm also looking for any pre/post-op tips! I plan to update this post with my pathology results, recovery experience, and (hopefully) full symptom resolution after surgery.

\[ Quick background on me:\] Overall very healthy—5'3"", 135 lbs, decent activity level. My only longstanding issue has been painful/problematic periods since my early 20s. Nothing else major until the past year+.

For over a year, I've had intermittent subtle/dull to mildly sharp pain in my right upper quadrant (RUQ), plus vague ongoing symptoms like chronic fatigue, waking up exhausted, chronic morning headaches, and joint pain. I chalked it up to ""just getting older.""

* June: First major episode after hot honey pepperoni pizza—explosive diarrhea about 45 minutes later, along with dull ""contraction-like"" spasm pains in the RUQ (pain \~2/10). Thought it was food poisoning.
* July: Second episode after morning coffee + steak hibachi lunch. Explosive diarrhea \~1 hour later (bad enough for an accident—never happened to me before), followed by RUQ spasm pain (3-4/10), indigestion, upper back pain between the shoulders, and feeling awful overall. Googled RUQ pain and gallbladder kept coming up.
* August: Saw my PCP and described the episodes. She ordered a liver/gallbladder ultrasound. Results: ""Well-distended but completely normal gallbladder, no stones."" Report noted negative Murphy's sign, though I mentioned slight pain during the scan. Doc said to let her know after another episode so she could order a HIDA scan.
* October: By now, daily explosive diarrhea after most meals (especially worse with mid-morning coffee). RUQ spasm/dull pain 1-2x per week, occasionally moderate (3-4/10). I also started massively shedding hair.
* HIDA scan results: ""There is prompt uptake and excretion of the radiotracer by the liver. There is free spillage of radiotracer into the intestine. The gallbladder is visualized within 7 minutes. Following the administration of 4 ounces of ice cream, the gallbladder ejection fraction is 22%. A normal value is greater than 35%.""
   * I decided to try a lower-fat diet and avoiding triggers (pizza, spicy foods, Mexican) because surgery felt extreme with zero stones. My primary doc was supportive of trying this first.
* November: Symptoms escalated—lots of diarrhea after most foods even things like baked chicken breasts, severe general fatigue, chest pain, between-shoulders back pain, tons of bile reflux keeping me up all night (not helped by Tums or a 21-day course of omeprazole), and feeling short of breath. Hair shedding continuing and pretty intense. I finally scheduled a surgical consult; laparoscopic cholecystectomy set for Dec 29. Surgeon said biliary dyskinesia is highly likely but ""does not ever guarantee symptom resolution"" (I assume that's standard disclaimer language).
* Current (mid-December): On a very strict low-fat diet (99% just soup), the diarrhea has completely resolved, but now I'm dealing with horrible constipation and very sticky/gummy/nasty poop when I do go—impossible to clean (TMI, sorry!). Only getting regular BMs with daily Miralax and drinking coffee. Without it, I get severe bloating, intense RUQ gallbladder pain, and all the old symptoms come roaring back if I try anything beyond soup or missing coffee and Miralax. My hair shedding has slowed a little but still ongoing. 

Gallbladder contraction pain is minimal now since I'm barely eating solids, but this shift from explosive diarrhea to severe constipation has been really rough. Has anyone else experienced this on a strict low-fat diet pre-surgery? Or had similar symptoms with low EF and no stones?

I'm also curious about laparoscopic recovery experiences: pain management, when you could eat normally again, any lingering issues? I've been reading this sub for months and finally decided to share my story—it's been incredibly helpful. :)

I fully intend to follow through with surgery because eating soup for the rest of my life just isn't sustainable. I'll update my surgery story under this thread after the 29th and what life after my gallbladder is like.

Appreciate you all and thank you for reading my story and sharing advice!",2,1765832453.0,gallbladders,2,1.0,False
1pnium5,https://www.reddit.com/r/founder/comments/1pnium5/i_built_an_ai_that_turns_your_git_commits_into/,I built an AI that turns your Git commits into readable status reports (so you never have to write one again),"Been working on this for a while and finally ready to share.



The problem: Every week I'd spend 1-2 hours scrolling through commits trying 

to answer ""what did we ship?"" for stakeholders who don't speak developer.



The solution: An AI layer that connects to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket, captures 

commits and PRs via webhooks, and uses Claude to generate human-readable 

summaries automatically.



Before:

\- feat: impl oauth2 flow w/ refresh tokens

\- fix: rm deprecated api calls  

\- refactor: extract auth logic to middleware



After:

""This week we launched Google and GitHub login support. Users now stay 

signed in longer thanks to automatic session refresh. We also fixed API 

timeouts that were causing intermittent errors.""



Tech stack:

\- Next.js 15 + TypeScript

\- MongoDB + Mongoose

\- Bull queues for async report generation

\- Claude API for summarization

\- Webhooks (not polling) for real-time data



Other features that came from the same data layer:

\- AI agents you can chat with (""What did Sarah work on last week?"")

\- Developer leaderboards with a ""Coffee Score"" algorithm

\- Auto-generated public changelogs

\- Slack integration

Hello fellow humans (and possibly bots 👀),

I have officially reached that dangerous level of boredom where staring at the wall feels like premium entertainment. So here I am, bravely stepping into the wild lands of Reddit in search of cool, weird, nerdy, or equally bored people to talk to. If you enjoy random conversations that start with absolutely no direction and somehow end up discussing space, memes, life, conspiracy theories, or why coffee tastes better at night — congratulations, you qualify.

You don’t need to be interesting (I’m not either), just curious, sarcastic, or bored enough to pretend we’re cool. If you’re a nerd, overthinker, night owl, or someone procrastinating important life decisions — welcome aboard. Let’s talk nonsense, exchange hot takes no one asked for, and collectively feel productive while doing nothing at all.

*When humanity thought that trench warfare was gone at the end of the Second World War, the early 21st century, with the beginnings of drone warfare and the so-called transparent battlefield, was a teaching moment.*

*Drones now created death zones around armies where no one could move without being seen and without being in danger.*

*The rise of simple battlefield VIs made this transition even more explicit. On a modern battlefield, VI-controlled drones are everywhere, seeing everything. Generals have every piece of information at their fingertips, and sometimes even better situational awareness than the troops on the front.*

**Excerpt from:** ***Ground Combat 101***  
**Date unknown**

 

Martife… It should have been a bridgehead for the advance into the continent. It was planned to clear the city building by building.

The city was now in ruins. Not in a figure of speech; the city no longer existed. Well, maybe some sewers and subway tunnels were left.

They had been stuck in the city for a month now. Each day, waves of Scrin, Firebugs, and Nazguls attacked, and each day they were repelled.

Nirfir’s mood was at a breaking point as he sat in his dugout. He and the 1st squad had dug a long, deep hole and sunk *Monkey King* into it, just deep enough that the turret peeked over the earthwork, ready for Rokla to unleash hell on any attackers.

Then they dug trenches and firing positions for the crew so they could add their fire to the IFV. The whole army, more than two hundred thousand soldiers, was stuck in and around the city.

Each time they tried to advance, Firebugs and Nazguls stormed out from seemingly nowhere and pushed them back.

Each time the monsters tried to push them back over the isthmus, they defended the city.

“Nirfir, what’s up, my boy? You look depressed.” Corporal Chibuike seemingly casually strolled around the corner of the maze-like trenches. Back from the firing position, he had guard duty. The camouflage netting covering the trenches cast the weirdest shadows on his armor.

“This whole situation… how long will we be stuck here?” Nirfir knew he had to show strength, but this type of war was not how Shraphen fought. He was not a burrow rat sitting in dirt waiting for prey. He was a hunter.

“Master Sergeant, that’s not how NCOs should talk.” Chibuike’s voice had a joking tone, but he was right. “I guess it’s a cultural thing? I guess your people are more used to hunting down your enemies in maneuver warfare?”

The human hit the right scent with his assumptions. Nirfir had learned to respect the experience and intuition of human soldiers. And their logistics.

The day they took the city, and it was clear they couldn’t advance, combat engineers built up a whole base for the army in the ruins.

Nirfir wasn’t a born soldier, but he had read about Shraphen history, and no Shraphen army had ever managed to keep such a large force supplied in such a position.

They got ammunition supplies dropped directly from orbit, two meters behind their tank. They had a kitchen five hundred meters to the rear, reachable by trenches.

Even further back, the army had drilled into the ground and built a field hospital and a repair center for the tanks.

As it was right now, they could hold the city forever. Or rather, the rubble of the city and the isthmus behind it.

“You’re right. Sorry.”

“Nothing to worry about. I get your feeling. During the Unification Wars a few years back, I was stuck in a trench for almost a year. That’s when I learned about bunker sickness. Bad stuff happens in your head when you get that.”

Frolox and Kumar joined them; they had just been relieved from guard duty by the 2nd squad. Each of them was covered in the grayish-brown dust that was everywhere.

They were both deep in conversation. “I tell you, something ain’t right. There’s nothing living here. Look, not a single bug, nothing.” Kumar almost shoved a handful of dirt into Frolox’s face.

The other soldier pushed the hand away. “And what does it matter? Dirt is dead. Big deal.”

Kumar looked to Nirfir. With his faceplate in transparent mode, Nirfir could see the agitation on his face.

“Sir, this is important. Everything here is dead. No, not dead. Inorganic. This dirt is just silica, gravel, and granite. Nothing organic in it.” The lance corporal now shoved the dirt in Nirfir’s face.

“Calm down, buddy. Explain slowly,” Chibuike cut the other soldier off.

Frolox seemed annoyed. “Don’t encourage him, by the great hunter in the sky. For eight hours, he didn’t stop muttering about dust.”

Nirfir was intrigued. He also had the feeling that something was out of place with their surroundings. “Let him speak, Frolox. Everything could be important.”

This encouraged Kumar. “Sir, my home was devastated half a generation ago. A tsunami, unlike anything ever before, killed hundreds of millions. I was just a kid back then. Whole cities were wiped off the face of the earth, but one thing stayed. Even thrived. Bugs.”

He turned around, pointing in every direction. “But here there is nothing alive, except what we brought in.”

Nirfir instantly knew he was right. He now knew what was missing. “The dead Firebugs and Nazguls would usually attract scavengers and flies, but there aren’t any. You’re right, Lance Corporal, this place is dead.”

Kumar grew more agitated. “No, sir, it’s more than that. This soil is dead. Don’t you understand? It’s like something scraped every living molecule out of it. Even if we retake the continent, it needs terraforming.”

Nirfir began to understand, and a suspicion formed about where the organic material had gone.

Turning around and leaving the arguing squad members behind, he contacted Kali directly. The combat VI might know if the observation was important. Since Sergeant Major Zhou had been sent to the hospital after a Scrin pierced his armor, he was now the squad leader and had direct access to the VI.

“Kali, Master Sergeant Nirfir here, I… ahmm.” Nirfir had never spoken to a VI; he did not know how well the computer program would understand him.

He remembered Sergeant Major Zhou talking to it quite casually, but VIs and AIs were forbidden technology under Batract rule, so this was absolutely new to him.

*“Yes, Master Sergeant. Is there something of urgency to report?”*

“Ahhmm, yes. My soldiers and I, we noticed…” Nirfir did not know how to explain it to a computer. “Everything is dead here. Even the dirt is lifeless, and there are no scavengers. Nothing. Not a single plant or moss.” The last observation only came to him while speaking.

*“Please wait a second.”* Was Kali’s only response.

A humming sound indicated that one of the never-ending stream of surveillance drones was coming closer.

Indeed, it flew right next to Nirfir. *“I just scanned the frontline and the surroundings. You’re right, Master Sergeant Nirfir. I’ll inform General MacAllister right away.”*

Nirfir was not sure he liked what he had just heard. The VI would bother the High Pack Leader with his observations about dirt?

—————

*“General, we have an intriguing report from the Martife front.”*

Kali’s voice interrupted General MacAllister’s concentration. The fucking Martife front. Almost half of his troops were stuck in a seemingly unbreakable quagmire. At least they had prevented the enemy forces from moving and maneuvering.

“Another attack?” He was already used to that. The enemy tried to take the city’s ruins every other day. Up until now, without success.

*“No, sir. It’s an environmental report, but in my opinion, of the highest urgency.”*

That intrigued the general. Kali was a no-nonsense VI, just how he liked it. Environmental data was not something it would react to unless it was of strategic or tactical importance.

Leaning back in his office, he took a sip of his coffee. It was almost 1900 board time, so he had time to indulge himself with something different than mission planning for today. “Shoot.”

*“Master Sergeant Nirfir and his squad, members of the 22nd Mechanized, have noticed that their surroundings seem extraordinarily dead.”*

“Well, they are in the ruins of a city that was bombed back to the drawing board. That’s usually not something where I’d expect the Garden of Eden.” Why was Kali taking up his time with something so trivial?

*“Pardon, sir. I wasn’t precise enough. There is no life detectable. I cross-checked with other troops on site. No one saw any scavengers, or even bugs or other insects. Scanning the continent also showed that there is no detectable plant life.”*

“Yeah, we noticed. We assumed it was the same as on Sirius, where the Batract assimilated everything.”

*“Correct, sir. But upon closer inspection, the site on Sirius showed that some life prevailed. Here, the ground has the quality of regolith.”*

This was new, Mac Allister leaned forward, letting his aids know to come to his office via a button on his intercom.

“Go on”

*“I have conducted as many tests as my primitive surveillance drones are capable of. The area seems to be void of any organic material. This has to be related to Batract activities.”*

The aide entered the office. “Saito, get me some eggheads from the fleet. Biologists and botanists, if we have any. And wake Sanders. There’s something off on that cursed continent. Oh, when will the 3rd and 5th Armies from Earth arrive?”

Major Saito Aoto jumped to attention. “Yes, sir. The 3rd and 5th will arrive in one week, sir.”

“Good. Now get me the eggheads on the line.” The general ignored the salute of his aide and focused back on the report of the Sirius aftermath.

At first, it really looked like every form of life in the valley had been consumed by the spawn, but there was still insect activity even after Browner had used a Dragonfire shot to grill the mountain. If what Nirfir and Kali were saying was true, something of far greater magnitude had happened here.

Something he certainly didn’t like.

“Kali, check in with the other commanders on the front to see if they notice the same thing. If so, warn them to treat any life signs as potentially hostile.”

*“Yes, sir… done.”*

MacAllister loved working with Kali. Fast, efficient, and usually didn’t ask stupid questions. He hadn’t been sure about using battlefield VIs until this mission. But now that he suddenly had to command two full armies after poor General Jenkins had been relieved of duty, Kali had become an immeasurably valuable tool.

Fifteen minutes later, he was in a conference call with botanists, a few biologists, geologists, and every other -ists the fleet had to offer. Also linked in was an extremely tired-looking Admiral Sanders, who got her second coffee handed to her by some aide out of frame.

“So, you heard the reports from the ground. The Batract obviously did something unholy with all that biomatter. The question is, what?”

Dr. Stein, the biologist, was the first to speak. “At first, the troops in Shratora discovered large piles of Shraphen bodies, so those seem to be the only biological remains that were not taken.”

Admiral Sanders seemed to get visibly sick when Stein put up pictures of the remains. Calling them piles was generous; they seemed like mountains.

MacAllister sent a memo to his aide, instructing him to check the troops’ mental health in Shratora immediately. The city had been taken in the largest air cavalry invasion he knew of, under considerable losses.

The doctor continued. “This is concurrent with the discoveries made by Dr. Nesbitt, that Batract Hyphae cells can’t interact with Shraphen cells, a fascinating—”

Admiral Sanders interrupted the doctor, who seemed to be preparing one of his endless monologues. “Thanks, Doctor. Is there a way of finding the missing biomatter?”

Dr. Weissenbaum, another biologist, took over. “We made some initial ground spectrometer scans and could only find dead sand and stone deserts, but the gas-phase spectroscopy did show some promising results.”

The screen was now filled with a picture of the continent. On it, some areas were colored blue, interrupted by different-sized spots of yellow shading into red.

“What you see here is a visual representation of CO₂ levels. You see, the biggest spots are in the south, in Martife, where the enemy and we have massive armies.”

The general was impressed. This was a new way of finding the enemy. He saw the fat spot of Martife, and from the enemy’s frontline, he could clearly see lines of red extending into other places. Staging areas? Breeding grounds?

“The other remarkable spot is Shratora, here.” Weissenbaum marked the coastal city on the northwestern shore.

MacAllister noted again the two rings, made up of his and the enemy’s troops. Even here, the massive mountains of remains were sickening.

“But another large point remains a mystery.” The biologist pointed to a large, but less distinct, point at the geographical center of the megacontinent.

“The amount of CO₂ in the air leads us to believe something large is either breathing or rotting here. But for decomposition, we miss other gases like methane. Also, the lack of a distinct line, like in the other spots, leads us to believe we’re looking at something subterranean.”

MacAllister focused on the spot. “What is it?”

Weissenbaum shrugged. “Unknown, sir. We’re waiting until night so we can gather better infrared readings, but if I were a betting man, I’d say enemy stronghold.”

One geologist chimed in, nervously playing with a pen in his hands. “This would be the perfect spot for an underground base. The area there is granite and limestone. If the caves are deep enough, we can’t take it out with orbital fire without creating a nuclear winter on the planet.” The geologist showed scans of the area.

“Granite, with its crystalline structure, is extremely tough, and the limestone between the granite layers acts like a laminate.”

“If the area is covered with granite, how is CO₂ evaporating?” The general stared angrily at the scans of stone that ended his dreams of wiping out the enemy with one quick shot.

Weissenbaum enhanced the CO₂ scans again. “Vents and possible cave entries. Here and here.”

MacAllister focused on the areas. They were easily defensible, but not impossible to breach.

“So we have to send someone in if we want to know what’s down there.”

The scientists looked deeply distressed. They weren’t used to making decisions that might kill someone.

Then the geologist overcame his restraint.

“Yes, sir. It seems that way.”

It won't get her far, but maybe to the nearest outpost, so she can use the goodies to by a ship to dream of Port Merrick. For Annick I simply just got a buch of bait and I think she'll be quite happy with that. Aifrick is the most hunter of all, who loves her stories. So I brought her stories of the deadliest sea monsters on the Sea of Thieves and a log where she can write her stories when she takes on these beasts! Hopefully Emerick can sleep easier with these spears and defeat that flying fire breather with a nice caffeine boost. And lastl, but definetly not least, for Adelrick, since he's a fresh, aspiring hunter, I got a nice hunter's starter pack.

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay set in a nun convent or a mental asylum (a bit of a dream ^^"") as well!)

Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*

I am 23, F, and went on my very first lesbian date this past weekend.

I have been dating and seeing men up until now, with bisexual on my sleeve. However, I never really felt a \*genuine\* attraction when seeing these men. It felt like a normalcy that I had to follow through on sometimes, so my parents could be happy their daughter wasn't ""gay"" anymore like she said she was whenever she was 12. Did I love these men? Absolutely, and I felt very close with them, enough to share intimacy. But deep down that attraction never really felt genuine and it had been a guilt that was eating me alive.

My last relationship ended a few months ago, and it was almost 2 years long. I felt very close to him but it was the same situation as above. I met a group of friends shortly after this breakup, and during my lowest I made friends with a girl here. She was super sweet, fun to hang out with and we shared a ton of interests. I didn't even know how to talk to her, she made me super nervous. Just last week she asked me out, wanting to know if I wanted to go to a local museum with her and then to get coffee. I was utterly floored and immediately said yes.

This past Saturday was full of some of the most genuine, heart warming moments I have ever had. I never felt more comfortable with someone and it was an immediate connection that I never knew I could feel. These were all firsts for me. Kissing another woman sent me to another planet straight up, the cuddling with our hair on each other's shoulders, the little giggles past midnight with a funny show on... It was what me as a preteen always saw myself doing and feeling. We have plans to see each other again on Thursday at a local lesbian event night with her friends. I really want to hold her hand, eek!

I manage the construction (31f) and he manages the building once it’s done (33m). 

I have never felt more sure of a guy showing true interest than with him. He very reserved and professional but when it’s just him and I, the man changes his entire personality. He’s more talkative, smiles way more, is WAY more in my space (which I love lol), tease me, etc. If anything, I think he at least enjoys being around me. I’m super extroverted and, unfortunately, my face says everything. I know I’ve accidentally given him little flirty looks and had to catch myself (when it’s just the two of us). His face always softens and he will do like a light smile and then look away. We can easily turn it on and back off to be professional. I feel like he always initiates it because I’m just oblivious when it’s just him and I (he’s much taller so, in my defense, he can see when we are alone lol). I don’t know if it’s playful flirting with no intent or if he’s actually doing it with intent. 

I’m so nervous. I want to ask him to coffee, dinner, or drinks but I’m very unsure and don’t want to cross any lines. I technically gave him my number via Slack but I also did it in a way that was more professional. He literally texts and calls other people (including my superintendent lol) so it’s not like he doesn’t use his phone. 

Our project is wrapping up within the week and then we have a few final things to wrap up over the next month but minimal interactions.

1pniccp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1pniccp/is_the_entrylevel_job_market_just_broken/,Is the Entry-Level Job Market Just Broken?,"Long story short: in the middle of all my final exams, I got two new rejection emails from jobs I interviewed for. One, I had two interview rounds, the other I had three, and both sent the same generic “we’re proceeding with other candidates who better fit our needs” email.

I’m honestly at a loss about how people are getting jobs. I’ve applied to over 1,000 positions, and mass applying feels completely worthless because none of those applications led anywhere. The only times I’ve gotten interviews were after actually talking to people on LinkedIn. Even then, out of all those applications, I’ve probably only had coffee chats for about a third of them because so many people are unresponsive on LinkedIn.

I’ve taken advantage of conferences at UVA, career fairs, networking through clubs, and talking to guest speakers: literally everything you can think of, I’m doing. My résumé has been reviewed by the career center in the Commerce building probably over a dozen times, and I don’t think there’s anything fundamentally wrong with it.

The main issue is experience. I only have one internship because I’m really young and came into college early. I basically didn’t have a traditional first or second year of college, so my only internship was during my third year. That leaves a big gap, and I think employers see my age and lack of experience as a red flag.

What makes this even more discouraging is that over half of my friends graduated last year and are now unemployed, living at home with their parents. I really did not want that to be me. I set higher expectations for myself, and now I’m genuinely confused about how people seem to get jobs so easily.

I’m not first-generation, but both of my parents are elementary school teachers, so they don’t really have any networking connections in business or finance.

After being laid off earlier this year and unemployed for ~5 months, I accepted a Comms Manager role at a small nonprofit. The org and people are great, but the role isn’t what I expected—there’s very little press/media relations, and most of my work is fundraising/development communications.

I’ve now been contacted about a Deputy Comms Director role with state government that’s heavily press/media relations, plus some digital/enterprise comms. It aligns much more with the direction I want my career to go. The salary is about $2K less than I make now. Important context: nothing is official yet — I’m meeting the would-be supervisor for coffee soon to learn more, so this is still early-stage. 

The complication: my partner graduates in spring 2026, and we’re planning to move out of state in fall 2026, so I’d likely only be in this new role for ~1 year.

I’m not a job hopper and I’m worried about how this looks, especially after a recent layoff.
Would you stick it out in the current role until the move, or pursue the better-fit opportunity even if it’s likely short-term? Also, would you disclose the planned move during the hiring process?

TL;DR: Current nonprofit comms job is mostly fundraising and not a fit. Potential state job is better career fit (press-heavy) but I’m likely moving out of state fall 2026. Take it or stay?

1pnibqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DollarTree/comments/1pnibqb/dear_customers/,Dear Customers...,"I know you're going to hate me, but I gotta say that the reason some of you are mad when you're registering your stuff is because of your own actions. 

Associates love customers who don't make them do everything a customer is supposed to do themselves. 

Of course you don't get paid to do your shopping trip, and the employees should do your entire trip for you whilst you know their supervisor is going to get mad at them and not you because that customer service person was nice enough to help you instead of stand grounded in what their supervisor told them to do, and if they do stand their ground by the rules, you get upset because you didn't get your way. 

Things that can help associates focus on their job and not specifically on how they can only help you because the staff is short, and you're not the only person who requires help, so if they're focusing on you and you're taking all of their time on something you can do yourself, you're creating a mess of impatient people, and you don't like it when it's you waiting:

1. If you don't know where a specific aisle is, explore the whole store first before saying you can't find it. Don't just enter the store and ask.

2. If you don't see a product in the section where it should be, stop asking where it is cause you didn't see any, and if someone can go look in the back. We do our restocking on a certain day and I'm tired of saying, ""If you don't see it, we're out of it.""

3. There are price checkers all over the store and they all work greatly in my location, so in my perspective all of you people who have a budget have the mouth to complain how expensive Dollar Tree has gotten, but are too lazy to calculate your finances whilst you're shopping, and it's not hard at all cause I do it all the time, and I used to believe everyone did that. Your cashier doesn't know your budget up front. 

4. At the register, we have a wooden stick to separate orders, but rarely anyone is using it, so y'all get frustrated when I scanned all the merged mess of items and some of someone else's products get scanned, and some of you wait until it's more than 5 products. The cashier has no idea what is yours and what's not yours unless you're paying attention and keeping your stuff organized. Sometimes, the cashier is slow to test if you're paying attention to what you're buying or you don't care, and you're going to not take accountability. 
Sometimes, some of you who are the next customer will not pay attention to the fact that one of your items is in the middle of someone else's pile, not at the end, so the cashier obviously doesn't know that is yours until they're ringing your stuff up, and at the end you're asking what happened to your product. 


5. If the stick gets used for you to separate your orders into multiple transactions, don't get confused/frustrated if you chose to put something from another planned transaction to the one the cashier is currently scanning. It was organized and you messed the process by confusing the cashier into thinking that you're switching items around. 

6. Have your money ready before you start getting a cart and getting stuff. It's rude to get a cart full of stuff and say you'll be back in an hour because you don't have your money, and then you never come back to pay, so now that's a cart full of go backs. 
People who shop prepared shouldn't have to wait on an unprepared lazy shopper because the cashier scanned everything, and that person can't just pay and get out, so the cashier has to play patience cause they'll get upset, and then they have to call the manager to cancel the order, placing them at the back of the line again with their stuff at the register counter. 

7. Stop complaining about the prices. It is almost the end of 2025, more than a few months. Y'all already know it's not a dollar store anymore unless you were living under a rock or homeless. The CEO doesn't recieve your complaints, so you're just dumping on someone who has little authority to make a difference. 

8. If you see one or two carts in the wrong sector of the exit/entrance, nobody cares where you leave your cart, but when there is a tornado-like mess, why do customers think that is a pass to not put their cart away? Some of you act like you are blind and crippled, and you put your cart away when you didn't. 

9. You don't tell a barista how you want your coffee made after they made it, so don't tell an employee what you wanted after they serve you. Always do it beforehand. 

10. Don't be narcissistic torwards an employee. They don't have to answer to your, ""Hello, how are you today?"" They don't angrily demand you to reply to their greeting when you answer with silence. Let them do their other part of the job that actually serves you. Some of you be traumatizing the inner child, geez. 

11. If you have the audacity to say, ""I'm only going to this cashier because you're busy and I don't really want to be served by this cashier."" Ya um, this cashier heard you and you don't like this cashier cause you don't know them.

This cashier is possibly patient, nice, and packages your stuff in a bag or in another bag with decency, and they apologize for the inconvenience. 

Next time, you can wait in the other line cause they shouldn't have been that nice at all. ",12,1765831031.0,DollarTree,4,0.87,False

I take a different approach. I prefer to see a little of a lot rather than a lot of a few. If you're coming from a long, long way away like me (Australia) I think it's the best way to go to make the most of it. So here's how it went in our 29 nights:   

   

* Landed in Frankfurt, one night in **Mainz** \- Lovely little city with a great, walkable old town. Gutenberg museum definitely worth a visit!
* **Strasbourg** reached early the next morning mostly to visit European Parliament which was great to see in person since we're political nerds. Also just another great, historic old town perfect for a night stroll.
* **Bern** as a base for three nights in Switzerland. Bern itself is lovely and definitely my favourite of the major Swiss cities. Feel like it doesn't get a whole lot of love. 
   * Day trips to Neuchatel, Geneva and Lucerne, each of which definitely worth a visit. Basically cannot go wrong with anywhere in the country but thought Lucerne was a great balance of beauty and not being super busy.
* Long-ass trans-Alps voyage to **Vienna** for another three nights. Everyone knows about the highlights of Vienna already but adventures to **Hegyeshalom** and in particular **Bratislava** were great. Best meal of the trip was in Bratislava at the cutest Georgian/Ukrainian restaurant not far from the old town.
* **Bamberg via Nuremberg** for a quick stop to visit the Nuremberg court which was really cool to see in person thinking of what happened there. Just a quick night in Bamberg because it'd been on my list for a while but was still nice to see in a night and found a lovely tavern for a great Franconian meal.
* **Dresden** had also been on my list for some time but I found it a little disappointing. I've seen so many recommend it but it just didn't wow me. The highlight was the war museum which certainly was worth a visit however. Two nights there.
* **Berlin** for another two nights. I've been a few times before but was good to show my partner all the sights. Will never get tired of the history.
* Flight to **Stockholm** where we spent a few hours for dinner, coffee and a walk to the royal palace before grabbing the **night train to Lulea** which was very memorable. Sprung for a private cabin which was so fun to chill in our own space on the 13 hour train ride Lulea itself was buried in snow and later became icy which was challenging but a fun obstacle.
* 7 hour train across to **Narvik** was equally memorable. Mostly because we had to switch to a bus for the last hour of the trip which went through a blizzard. Disappointing since it was perfect northern lights conditions but was too cloudy to see :(
* Flight back down to **Paris** which a very short stop in **Oslo;** just enough time to get a coffee in the city and back to the airport.
* Eurostar across to **London** for three nights. Been there many times so again I played tour guide.
* Train up to **Glasgow** for two nights. I think underrated since everyone gives a weird look when you say you're going there. I thought it was pretty nice as far as UK cities go and we did a day trip to **Stirling** to see the castle which was definitely worthwhile.
* Back down to **Bradford** simply to get a cheap flight out the next morning. 
* Across to **Rome** for three nights. Everyone knows already but insane the history you stumble across by accident. Colosseum and Pompei some of those things which are touristy for a reason and everyone should do although the chaos of the streets can be pretty overwhelming.
* Train up to **Milan** for one night as that's where we fly back home from. 

Can't type out all my thoughts obviously but happy to answer questions especially in terms of planning and the quickness of it all.

*Getting too old for this.*

In front of my ragged couch, the TV continued with its black and white parade of old footage from a World War One documentary, though the war seemed nearly over now. Judging by the digital clock on the mantelpiece, which read 3:49 AM, I’d been asleep for at least five hours. My body ached, a familiar problem at my age, but enough that I chided myself for not going to bed earlier like a responsible person. It had been a long day, so I came home to a cold shower, a few hot dogs warmed in the microwave and settled down to watch some television before bed. Of course, at 55 years old I’d misjudged how tired I really was and spent close to half the night slumped on my sofa, which meant I would be paying for it in the morning with stiff joints and a sore back.

Palming my cracked Motorola from the coffee table, I found the TV remote and hit the *mute* button as I answered the call. “Hello?”

Shaky breathing grated on the other end, and after a few moments, a girl’s hushed voice whispered through. “Mr. Todd?”

Ice rippled through my veins at the sound of Cindy’s panicked voice, and I sat up straighter to rub at my bleary eyes. “Yeah, I’m here. You okay? What’s wrong?”

Silence greeted me, a strange mix of static, trembling breaths, and what sounded like sniffles as she tried to hold back tears. “Please . . . help me.”

“Cindy?” Concern building in my mind, I switched on a nearby lamp and pulled myself from the couch with a grunt at the tightness in my lower back. “You there? What’s going on?”

More shaky gasps followed, and just over the static, I thought I heard the faint sound of melodic humming in the background.

“Something’s wrong.” Cindy whispered, her words so quiet that they made each breath sound like cannon fire. “T-The woods are . . . something fell out of the sky and . . . it was so loud, it woke me up. There’s a fire.”

Brow furrowed, I moved fast for the kitchen, stumbling through the dark interior of my little cabin to grope for the light switch. “Stay calm, just stay calm and talk to me. You said there’s a fire? How far away? Can you get to your car?”

Another sniffle came through, clogged with harsh interference as the signal weakened, a sound that made my veins throb with tension. “I-I can’t. Something’s here, it’s in the house, it’s *in the house with me*. W-We can’t get out.”

My throat tried to close up, and I gulped hard against a wave of nausea. “Someone broke in? Are you hurt? Where’s Erin?”

A long pause, and in the background of the mute static, I could have sworn the humming sound cut out, as though whoever it was stopped their eerie melody all at once.

“She’s gone.” Something in Cindy’s tone changed, as if the fear drained away to a blank emotionless rasp, and the line went dead with a chilling *click.*

Every inch of my body racked with a shiver, and both feet seemed glued to the floor in a strange form of dread.

Like so many girls before them, Cindy Fadro and Erin Martinelli had been hired on to be caretakers and actors in the Wickenshire Living History Estate. Erin was 19, studying to be a nurse, while Cindy had just graduated high school and wanted to be a teacher. They were good kids, calm, intelligent, and great workers. Though I never had any children, they were like daughters of my own, and they even baked a cake for my birthday in June. Once they called me in for a leaky pipe, but only after they had done their best to fix it themselves with a tool kit I’d left in the stairwell cupboard. Smart little troopers that they were, the girls even had the common sense to shut the correct valve off and found the leak on their own. Had it been anyone else, I might have considered this to be a prank, a joke, some dumb idea made by bored kids to get a new video for their social media nonsense, but I knew Cindy and Erin.

They didn’t pull pranks like this.

Unnerved, I tried to redial her number but got no answer. Erin’s number yielded the same result, and I shook my head at myself.

*Screw it, I’m not taking any chances.*

I was midway through yanking my work boots on when the sheriff picked up.

*“Hello?”*

From the gruffness in his words, I could tell he’d been asleep as well, but I couldn’t waste time with the standard 911 procedures.

“David, it’s me.” I cinched down the laces on my boots and grabbed my Carhart jacket from its hook by the door. “Cindy just called from the Wickenshire place. There’s a fire on the mountain, and I think someone’s broken into the house. I’m headed there now.”

Rustling on the opposite end of the phone let me know David was up, likely going through the same motions as myself. The son of a Polish man and a Kootenai woman, David Kowolski and I had known each other since high school, and even played football on the same team. Nicknamed ‘White Cloud’ for his European features and Native American blood, he was stubborn with a quick temper, but tenacious when it came to his job. As a law man he drove his deputies relentlessly, backed them to the hilt when it came to any court battles, and as a result he’d managed to keep the crime in Jacob’s Fork quite low over the years. We didn’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I knew I could count on him when it came to something like this. If Cindy or Erin were in danger, Sheriff Kowolski would ride through hell and back to get them out, which was exactly the kind of man I needed right now.

*“I’ll get on the horn to a few of my boys and have them meet you there.”* He replied, and I heard the zipping of a coat on his end, along with the metallic *cha-click* of a handgun slide being racked. *“Fire teams are going to need time to get spun up, so whatever happens, don’t go wandering off without letting me know. Last thing I want is us getting caught in the flames if they decide to move down the mountain.”*

I nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see me and kept the phone pressed to my ear as I swiped my truck keys from the porcelain ashtray near the front door. “Got it.”

*“Be careful, Andy.”* His voice hitched in a low pause, as if the sheriff himself had as bad a feeling about this as I did, and he hung up.

Rain pattered on the windshield of my ancient pickup truck as I wound my way through the dark backroads of northern Idaho, the night sky black with the clouds of late fall. On the sun-faded seat next to me lay my work kit; a simple heavy duty canvas tool bag that held various tools, keys, a flashlight, and an old revolver handed down to me from my grandfather. I used the tools in my job every day as the groundskeeper, janitor, and fix-it-all handyman for the Wickenshire House, which had been part of our small town for as long as anyone could remember. Set on a picturesque 103 acres of fields and woodland in the shadow of the nearby Smoke Point Mountain, the Wickenshire House was a rare example of eastern architecture in the far reaches of the American West. It was the property of our town’s oldest resident, Mr. Edward J. Watkins, a kindly if forgetful soul who’d seen 91 years on this earth and still could drive his own car, though he had a little trouble with stairs. He lived in a cottage on the western edge of town, but I wasn’t about to call him at this time of night, even for something so urgent. Knowing Ed Watkins, he would try to drive out to the house with his slippers on and get hurt stumbling around in the flames.

*Or run into whatever scumbag is in the house, God forbid.*

On the horizon, some of the clouds began to glow, an orange flicker that widened on the mountainside as the distant fire spread. I could barely glimpse an odd plume of smoke in the sky, not curved upward from the fire but downward in a long arc, backlit by the flames. Looking at it, I had a momentary lapse of courage, my resolve wavering. Cindy had said something ‘fell from the sky’. This looked like a trail of some kind, maybe a crashed plane or a fallen weather balloon. If there was jet fuel on the ground, the fire would be even worse to put out than usual. It was horrible, rotten luck all the way around; a wildfire on the same night the house had its first break in, while the girls were there alone.

Adrenaline pumping, I sped up the lonely gravel trail to the house, one of the final sections of public roadways that got this close to the mountain. The Wickenshire House reared from the gloom ahead, its tall gates and Victorian gables illuminated by the dual halos of my truck’s headlights. It still took my breath away, the ornate beauty of the place, built as if every stone had been placed by a perfectionist’s hand. It stood at two stories in height, built from stone mined at the local quarry, with multiple chimneys, a balcony overlooking the back garden, and a grand front porch that wrapped halfway around the entire structure. A stone wall encircled the main grounds, with a wrought iron gate at the drive and several ornamental gardens interspersed throughout. Plush lawns stretched in between, and there were a few oak trees planted there for their brilliant colors in the fall. A small garage had been built around the back of the house sometime in the 1960’s, but this mainly held the riding lawnmower and a small shop where I did most of my repair work. Cindy and Erins’ cars were parked back there, the front gravel lot reserved for visitors during the daily tours. I didn’t see any other vehicle that the intruder might have used, but something else caught my attention in that moment, and held it with a pull like gravity.

*Lord have mercy.*

I stared, slack jawed, at a huge sea of flames that roared through the nearby trees with a voracious appetite. The fire hadn’t wasted any time, chewing through the wet growth as if the rain had never fell, evergreens crackling as they burned to dust in minutes. The heat came through my windshield in a steady increase, warm enough that I couldn’t tell the difference between the fire and my truck heater. The open grassy slopes around the house were consumed as the flames inched closer to the building, and fire closed in from both east and west.

Bounding from my truck, I dashed up to the front door and pulled the handles.

The polished brass knobs rattled but didn’t turn, the flames licking their way across the prairie grass outside the ornate courtyard walls.

*Locked. That means our scumbag didn’t break in through here. Maybe he went around the back?*

With shaking hands, I put down the canvas tool bag and dug in it for my key ring.

Sirens began to wail in the distance, and I finally managed to force the doors open, leaving the keys in the lock to snatch my aged pistol.

“Cindy!” I produced a flashlight with my left hand to hold it beneath my gun, and swept the beam of it over the murky interior. “Erin! Where are you?”

I’d been in the house countless times over the years, but in that moment it felt suffocating, like a great stony maw waiting for me to go far enough in so as to swallow me whole. The foyer led to a large room with a grand staircase, doorways on either side opening to the main dining room and a sitting room respectively. Signs and velvet ropes were posted to guide visitors through the proper areas, a gift shop in the rear of the house near the old parlor, along with guest bathrooms added on to the original back porch. With all the lights off, it looked alien, surreal for this part of the country with its eastern Victorian mystique, and my skin prickled at the sensation that there were eyes in every shadow. Of course, I had been stupid to yell. I’d let my panic get the better of me, and now I had given away the element of surprise. If some creep was in the house somewhere with Erin or Cindy, doing God-knows-what, I wouldn’t be able to sneak up on him now.

*Alright then, might as well move fast.*

With the old revolver grasped in my trembling hands, I headed for the stairs and took them three at a time. The wood creaked under my steps, ancient chestnut and oak that had been sawn before the Great Depression, each footfall like a cannon in the silent house. From here, the roar of the fire outside seemed a muffled whisper, as though there were two different realities, and the house stood guard between them. However, I remembered the heat coming through the windshield of my pickup and knew I didn’t have much time. Soon the house would be in flames, the fire outside enough to melt glass and ignite the wooden siding in minutes.

I reached the top of the stairs and swept my flashlight beam down both ends of the corridor at the top, uncertain of which direction to go first. Cindy and Erin were roomed down the hall to the left, but if someone had indeed broken into the house, Cindy might have hid somewhere else. Every second wasted could mean life or death, and I realized that either way, I’d be turning my back to the unknown.

Something flickered in the beam of my light, a brief whisp of shadow that jerked back behind the far corner of the right-side hallway. I didn’t have more than a moment to see clear details, but there was enough of an image burned into my mind that it came to me in a cold rush.

A face.

*Kowolski, you’d better get here soon.*

Swallowing, I paced down the hallway, my handgun leveled on the spot where the shadow had been.

Upon reaching it, I inched in a wide arc around the corner, bracing for a figure to jump out at me.

The air caught in my throat, and I stared at a section of wallpaper bathed in the aura of my flashlight.

Brownish-black sludge had been daubed on the wall, smeared into a perfect circle so that the excess dripped over the wallpaper like ebony tears. I couldn’t tell if it was mud, blood, or something else, but the corridor stank of rot and the putrid scent of stagnant water. Thorny bits of twig had been woven together, tied here and there with bits of plant fiber to form a circle that overlaid the sludge. Pasted together on the wall, these seemed to make up a protective ring, and in the middle were the handprints.

From what I could see, they were two different sizes, slender fingers and narrow palms indicating two younger females. Both prints faced downwards, slightly overlapping each other at the heel of the palm, and the thumbs arced toward one another like pincers. Unlike the grimy sludge, these were pressed to the old wallpaper in an unmistakable red hue, and it hit me what I was looking at.

*A spider.*

The four fingers of each hand made the legs, the thumbs its mandibles. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the blackness of the outer paste came from petals . . . rose petals to be exact. There were no roses growing in Idaho this time of year, and I’d never seen a natural black rose in my life, yet these appeared fresh. Most had been ground to a powder that gave the foul substance its dark color, others pushed into the muck like decorative flair, giving a strange, heady undertone to the mixture. With this discovery came more clarity; the thorny twigs glued into the circle were not random. They spread inward toward the spider, forming a sharp web of spikes that enshrined it, with the careful touch of an artisan. Such a display would have taken hours to make, certainly longer than the time it took for Cindy to call me. How was this possible?

*“Mr. Todd!”*

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the horrific cry echoing from somewhere behind me, Cindy’s voice tinged in pain and fear.

No sooner had I turned, running a short distance back toward the main corridor at the top of the stairs, and the voice cut out with a high, agonized scream.

“Cindy!” I charged toward the girls’ rooms, heart pounding in my chest.

*“Help me!”* Back in the direction of the symbol, Erin’s voice rang out, choked with sobs and full of torment. *“Mr. Todd, please!”*

Acidic bewilderment slithered through my mind, and I skidded to a stop, caught in the middle of the hallway, the staircase just to my left. I had been so close, perhaps a door away from Erin only moments ago. Could there be more than one intruder holding the girls in separate rooms?

*Cindy is closest. I have to get to her. She sounds like she’s hurt.*

Teeth gritted against the screams of Erin, I forced myself through the left side hallway, her voice ringing in my ears as she begged for my help.

At the end of the hall, I reached the rooms given to the girls and lunged for the handle to Cindy’s.

It didn’t turn, locked from the inside.

Backing up, I drove the heel of my boot into the door next to the lock and heard the old wood splinter. Any other time, I would have balked at such destruction, these doors being over 80 years old, but it didn’t matter anymore. What the fire didn’t get would not be worth Cindy or Erin’s lives.

The door swung open to slap against the bedroom wall, and I dashed inside, revolver in hand.

*What the . . .*

Within the quiet interior of the bedroom, everything looked untouched, the curtains partially open, the bed rumpled from where Cindy had gotten up to check the window, a discarded work uniform in the clothes hamper by the door. Dark stained wood trim lined the walls, windows, and doorway, the walls papered with a robin egg blue pattern that gave it an airy feeling. The white lacy curtains wafted like clouds in the slight draft that came in the open hallway door, and the vintage hot water heater gurgled in the corner as steam worked its way through the pipes. There were modern touches as well, more lamps and lights plugged into the discreet electrical outlets in the walls, a small television on its stand across from the bed, and a side door opened to a shared bathroom between Cindy’s room and Erin’s. This room wasn’t open to tourists, as it was the private living quarters for our workers, so such things were permissible here, as opposed to other parts of the house. Nothing seemed out of place, but there was no sign of Cindy anywhere, no clues to indicate that she’d been there moments ago. It was as if she’d gotten out of bed, looked out the window, and vanished into thin air.

In a flurry of movement, I checked under the bed, in the closet, and the bathroom. When those came back clean, I broke through the bathroom door into Erin’s room, only to find more of the same.

There was no sign of the girls anywhere.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* Erin’s screams continued from the opposite end of the long corridor, and I flung open the bedroom door to retrace my mad dash in her direction, confusion and frustration mounting.

Rounding the corner that bore the strange mark on the wall, I swayed to a stop on the old floorboards next to the door where her screams had come from and yanked on the knob.

*You’ve got to be kidding me . . . how many doors did they lock before I got here?*

With a gasp of exertion, I backed up to kick the door in like the last one, muscles tensed for the effort.

*“Mr. Todd!”* Cindy’s cries exploded from the doorway behind me, rabid and intense as the door rattles on its hinges like she was throwing herself against it from within the room.

I froze, staring at the door, heart racing as my mind whirled. How could she be in there? I’d heard Cindy on the other side of the house not five minutes ago. There was no way she could have moved that fast, not without going past me. I would have seen her in the hall, would have heard the ancient doors creaking on their hinges as they opened.

She couldn’t be in there.

*“Please, help me!”* Erin’s screams started up again, but this time from somewhere in the left-side hallway, and another door began to groan in muted *thuds* as if she too were trying to break it down.

A dry fear crept into my throat, different than what I’d known coming into the house. This didn’t make sense. Erin’s voice had been coming from the door I stood ready to break into, but now it was to my left. Cindy’s had been coming from her room in the west wing but now called from the door behind me. Neither could have left their respective rooms without entering the hall, and I knew for a fact that there weren’t any old-fashioned servant entrances anywhere that could have let them move unnoticed. Something was wrong, very wrong.

Shaken, I took a step away from the door that echoed with Cindy’s voice. “Cindy?”

*“Mr. Todd!”* She begged from the other side of the oak planking, the wood slamming against the jam with wild urgency. *“Please, help me! Please!”*

“The door is locked.” I tried not to hyperventilate as I watched the knob rattle in its socket, knowing fully well the lock was on her side of the door. “Can you let me in?”

Her wails increased in pitch, the screeches an awful combination of agony and terror that made my stomach churn. It sounded as if Cindy was being tormented in the worst ways imaginable, but something about the cadence of each shriek felt off, enough that my brain sent up warning alarms inside my skull.

*“Mr. Todd, please!”* She pleaded once more, the same words both girls kept using in various rearrangements over and over, the door shuddering under each blow she made.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I sucked in a breath, eyes focused on the doorknob as it clacked back-and-forth, like Cindy wanted to open it but couldn’t. An uncanny thought rose in my mind, bone-chilling in its clarity, growing louder and louder so that it burst from me before I could stop it.

“Cindy,” I gripped my flashlight so hard that my knuckles turned white. “What’s my first name?”

Like a thunderclap, Cindy’s pleas ceased, along with Erin’s, so that the entire house fell into dead silence. Nothing moved, and even the muffled roar of the wildfire outside seemed deadened further than before, as though the house was a vacuum of sound. My skin crawled, the air thick in my lungs, and a strange certainty took hold of me that made the sense of dread even worse as Cindy’s words about Erin trickled through my brain.

*She’s gone.*

*Click.*

To my right, a doorknob at the far end of the hallway unlocked.

*Click.*

Another lock slid open, this one closer, the doors remaining shut as more joined them one-by-one.

*Click.*

*Click.*

*Click.*

A twinge of panic tightened in my throat, but I leveled the beam of my flashlight at the first door that had unlocked, blood surging in my temples. Everything seemed loud, the heartbeat in my chest, the breath in my lungs, the groan of the floorboards under my boots. My vision narrowed, a vibration hummed to life inside my skull, and I tasted metal on my tongue. In my hand, the flashlight began to flicker as if the batteries were struggling to remain lit, and I couldn’t lift the revolver, my arms refusing to move like the gun weighed as much as a car.

The locks carried on past me, every door on the second story unlocking itself in a continuous march, until at last, the final *click* resounded from the far hallway like cannon fire to my ears.

For a moment, the silence returned, so thick it may as well have been water.

*Wham.*

Every door on the second story flung open, impacting against the wall inside their respective rooms so hard that I heard plaster *crunch*, the hinges squealing on old dust.

With them came the screams.

There were hundreds of voices, some human, others less so, bellowing at the top of their lungs to be heard over one another. If they were saying any words, they were lost among the throng, a constant roar of vocals that soured in my ears for the sheer volume of it. Somewhere among the morass, I could barely catch the sound of Erin and Cindy’s voices shrieking with the others, a morbid choir of pain, suffering, and fear. It seemed to seep out of the floorboards, ooze from the heater vents, and rebound off the walls in every direction. With the doors open, the deep orange glow of the flames outside poured into the house like a tidal wave, but oddly enough no heat came with it, the hallway as cold as if I’d stepped into a freezer. The shadows elongated in the firelight, swaying as they inched up the papered walls, and a pungent smell followed them.

Roses.

It came with overpowering strength, sickly-sweet, but unmistakable. As the tide of shadows advanced down the hall toward me, the fermented stink of roses filled the air like poison gas, and I tasted copper on my lips.

*I have to get out of here.*

Coughing on the blood running from both nostrils, I stumbled toward the stairs, my head a mess of static. Like a tide of slithering vines, the inky shadows pursued me with ravenous hunger. I could feel their magnetic pull, the chorus of screams still ringing across the house with deafening volume, a terrible siren song that tugged at something deep within my subconscious. Voices, so many voices, begged me to stay, to go back, to find the darkest room and sink myself into the abyss until it drowned me.

Something tightened on my ankle just as I reached the top of the staircase, and I toppled headlong down the steps.

*Bam.*

My hip rammed into a banister, and I lost my grip on the pistol.

*Wham.*

Another step hit my shoulder, and I felt my teeth bite into my tongue, the flashlight clattering away into the floor below.

*Smack.*

My head connected with the floorboards at the landing, and the blackness threatened to close over my eyes for the last time.

*Creak.*

One of the steps flexed under the weight of a foot, and I gulped air in pain to squint at the shadows.

*Creak.*

Another footstep echoed toward me, something at the top of the steps descending with a slow, methodical gait. It didn’t sound heavy, not the deft pace of a large man or thick boot, but almost delicate, light, graceful. Yet, there was something about each carefully placed step, each sigh and squeak of the aged woodwork that made my skin wriggle. Something was coming, something that knew exactly where I was even in the pitch blackness of the house.

It was watching me, *stalking* me through the shadows like a cat with a mouse.

Desperate fear surged in my brain, and I clawed through the dark on my stomach to find a way out. I last remembered the front door being nearby, but it seemed to take an eternity to move across the cold floorboards, the unseen presence mere yards behind me as I wriggled forward.

At last, I managed to gain my footing, though it hurt to put weight on my right leg, and hurled myself forward in the blind shadows.

*Thud.*

Both front doors flew open, and I tumbled out onto the porch, rolling down the steps into the stones of the walkway.

Like a switch had been thrown, the world seemed to come alive once more, the cold sensation fading, the sound returning. Sirens wailed closer as headlights appeared in the long gravel driveway, and the crackle of flames roared from the trees. Smoke filled my nostrils, heat from the nearby fire licked over my skin, and I rolled onto my side to look back toward the house.

My lungs tightened, and I stared, unable to pull my eyes away.

Inside the open front doorway, nothing was visible, not the glint of firelight from inside, nor the faint glow of it coming through any ground windows. The entrance was a mass of impenetrable shadows that seemed to form a solid wall at the threshold, yet deep within that abyss, something stared back.

It had no shape, no form that I could identify it with, but there was definitely a presence that stood just beyond the light, watching me from the gloom. My eyes seemed fastened to it, either by my own primordial fear, or perhaps willed so by whatever peered out of the wretched expanse. A torrent of emotions ripped through my mind, warped and misshapen, like cold fingers pried at the taps of my humanity to unleash a maelstrom of feeling. Hunger and fear. Hate and despair. Lust and sadness. Grief and pain. They all rolled over one another, tumbling in and out of each other in a never-ending tide, and it hit me with a strangled form of clarity that these weren’t *my* emotions.

Locked in place by the unknown being’s gaze, I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as cry out, my only option to fight back with what little expression I had left.

*What are you?*

Something about my terrified thought seemed to strike a chord within the cascade of terrible shadow, for the next instant the doors on the house creaked in their wrought-iron hinges, and then swung shut on their own.

The rest of the night was a blur, a stupor, one that I wandered through in a mindless fog. Firefighting crews appeared from miles around to help put out the blaze, but not before it chewed through all 103 acres on the Wickenshire estate. Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was burned to cinders. Even boulders cracked from the intense heat, the smoke pall so large it could be seen from Montana, or so I heard. One of the fire trucks exploded when its fuel tank caught fire and killed three men. Everything burned . . . except the house.

For some reason, the fire stopped at the stone courtyard walls and went no further. In a blaze hot enough that it had turned some minor sandpits on the mountain to crude glass, there wasn’t so much as a scorch mark on the house or its outbuildings. None of the paint peeled, the siding wasn’t so much as warm to the touch, and all the plants withing the yard were unscathed. The investigators couldn’t even find ash on the roof from the fire afterwards, not a single flake. Unlike its ruined acreage, the Wickenshire House had survived the wildfire unharmed, and no one could make any sense of it.

Once the fire was finally put out, they took me to the local clinic for my injuries, a sprained ankle, a dislocated shoulder, and a concussion from my tumble down the stairs. Sheriff Kowolski visited in the morning to see how I was, and to fill me in on what I’d missed once they trucked me away from the site.

Over three hundred search and rescue volunteers had been called out, along with special forensics teams from neighboring counties, and they hadn’t found any sign of Cindy Fadro or Erin Martinelli. The last time they managed to ping Cindy’s phone via satellite, it had registered a mile up the slope from the house, but they never managed to recover the device. Tracking dogs refused to go near the house and seemed to lose all scent once they left the property boundaries. No trace of Erin was discovered, and no DNA could be found in either of the girls’ rooms to point to a culprit. One of the searchers claimed he had heard what sounded like a female voice screaming for help on the northern slope, but he wasn’t sure where it had come from, and no one else could verify it. Another man claimed he saw someone walking inside the tree line near the eastern edge of the property but never got a good glimpse at their face to see who they were. With all speculation bereft of evidence, it seemed to everyone that both Cindy and Erin had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Worse yet, when I described my account to the sheriff, he informed me that his team hadn’t found any symbols painted on the walls, nor did they see anything out of the ordinary. All they found that aligned with my story was the strange, overwhelming aroma of roses that permeated the house.

Nothing more.

That was six weeks ago. I got out of the clinic within a few days after the event, but the continued search efforts proved fruitless. With their investigation coming up cold, the sheriff’s office released the house back to Mr. Watkins, who closed it indefinitely. I had never seen him so distraught in my life, as Ed took the girls’ disappearance rather hard. He felt personally responsible, though we all knew there wasn’t anything he could have done, especially since no one knew what happened to Erin or Cindy. However, Ed apparently decided to go there himself late one evening to do some looking around the house and didn’t bother to tell anyone else. It wasn’t until his cleaning lady stopped by his cottage in Jacob’s Fork the next morning that Ed was reported missing, and police dispatched to the Wickenshire House.

They never found him.

His car was parked out front, the doors unlocked, but they couldn’t find a trace of Edward Watkins anywhere on the property. I helped with the search, as I basically slept in the sheriff’s office these days, and found no sign of a struggle or any other foul play, only the smell of roses. We dug deep this time, rifled through local records, archives, property history, everything we could get our hands on about the estate. There was nothing to indicate this place would be trouble, no forgotten building plans with hidden rooms, no land disputes with older tenants, no tribal issues from burial grounds or holy sites. The property was normal, and even when I poked around to see if there had been any deaths, suicides, or other sordid affairs associated with the house, my search came up blank. There was no reason for this to be happen, not from human effort, or anything else.

Even now, as December drags on, nothing has been the same. No plants grow in the burned zone, not even the smallest patch of liken or moss, as if the ground is poisoned to its core. Animals avoid it, so that the uncharred sections of forest around the property are empty, silent places. The access road is chained off to keep curious locals away, and Sheriff Kowolski let me bunk at a small ranger cabin at the base of the mountain just so I could keep tabs on the place. I think he knew I needed to be close, to keep an eye on the house, and keep looking for answers. I can’t explain why, but I know something is in there, waiting, biding its time. It failed to get me that night, but I have a terrible premonition that it doesn’t need *me*.

It just needs *more*.

I’ve found markers in the last few days. Piles of bones. Not haphazard from an animal kill, but stacked, organized, purposeful. Bits of twine made from plant fibers hold them together, and despite being in the open, no animals will bother them, not even the vultures. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, they think I can’t process the girls being gone, but I’ve stumbled on over a dozen of them now. They seemed to be set in a wide ring around the property line, spanning outward from the house into the forest beyond, capturing more territory by the day. No matter how many times I remove them, the piles always reappear, with fresh bones added to the stacks. I don’t touch them anymore, and I don’t even make eye contact with the empty eye sockets of the skulls. The few times I have, I heard whispers in my sleep, and had nightmares of eyes in the shadows of my room.

Some of the bones are like those of a rabbit or mole, while others are bigger like elk or bear. Every pile is topped with a skull, most of them from small game, but five of the piles hold unique skulls; a bear, a coyote, an eagle, a snake, and lastly, a great bull elk. They are laid out opposite one another ringing the house, the rest of the smaller markers ranging from them into the forest beyond. Of all the markers, the one with the elk skull is tallest, its full spread of antlers still intact so that it is nine feet high at the eye sockets. I found a symbol painted onto the bone forehead with powdered charcoal that the rain never seems to wash away, no matter how many times I go up to it.

A spider.

One made of two slender, inverted hands, both the same size.

I’m posting this so that it’s on record, in case one of these days I don’t come back from that mountain. Service was always spotty up there before, but ever since that night, it’s been non-existent. Even the few trail cameras I’ve put out have either gone dead or produced nothing but blurry photos. Something is building these markers, watching me whenever I walk the perimeter, and shifting in the corners of my vision whenever I turn my head. I’ve discovered trail signs that have been purposefully moved to misdirect me. Sometimes I hear screams in the woods, distant and warped, but they sound like Erin’s cries. I see flashes of blonde hair in the bushes that I want to believe is Cindy, but I know it can’t be.

They’re gone, both of them.

Only the sheriff understands, even if he doesn’t say much to that effect. I can see it in his eyes, he knows that I’m telling the truth, and his own deputies have been up to the house to see the piles multiple times. There’s nothing they can do, nothing but wait from the valley below and hope that the snow buries whatever it is for the winter.

There’s something wrong with the Wickenshire House, something *inside* it, something unseen that walks the grounds day and night. It wants more than the estate, I can feel it, can taste it in the wind, hear it in the dry crunch of snow under my boots, and feel it in the shivers I get every time I look at the dark, barren windows of that cursed structure.

It wants the forest, the trees, the mountain.

It wants *everything*.",5,1765830426.0,u_RandomAppalachian468,0,1.0,False

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**Platform(s):**  
Played on PC, on [construct.net](http://construct.net/), but could be on other websites(unity, [itch.io](http://itch.io) maybe)

**Genre:**  
2D First person, real-time reaction, spamming keys

**Estimated year of release:**  
2018-2022

**Graphics/art style:**  
\- very simple 2D digital art, a little pixelated, not cartoon, messy office desk theme  
\- colors weren't extremely bright if i recall correctly, mostly like warm neutral colors like gray or beige and blue or green on the monitors  
\- more landscape than portrait  
\- desk had scattered sticky notes, keyboard, random papers scattered, maybe a pen or usb, wires  
\- left hand holds a coffee or energy drink  
\- only arms/hands are visible, one hand types, the other hand occasionally lifts a cup to sip from (idle animation)  
\- three monitors with i think random text and coding in the background, virus pop-ups are rectangular red alert boxes  
\- no cyberpunk vibes  
\- all one setting, no background changes, music is like chill cafe music with typing sounds in background

**Notable characters:**  
\- just the arms and hands visible, you can't see anything else IN GAME, but maybe a face on menu screen?  
\- right hand auto-types  
\- left hand holding a coffee/energy drink that occasionally rises to take a sip  
\- No faces, no people, just hands + desk.  
\- MAY have a face on menu screen?

**Notable gameplay mechanics:**  
\- There are three monitors in front of you.  
\- Each monitor corresponds to a zone of your actual keyboard:  
\- left monitor = left-side keys (QWER / ASDF region)  
\- middle monitor = middle keys  
\- right monitor = right-side keys

\- Random red virus pop-up windows appear on the monitors.  
\- Each popup on the monitors start filling up as the virus is on screen, but drains the health bar when you spam any key in the correct keyboard zone  
\- If a bar fills up, that screen becomes “infected,” and if it happens too many times, you lose  
\- The game gradually spawns more and more popups, sometimes multiple on one screen and faster and faster  
\- There may be a warning/alarm beep when a popup bar gets close to full  
\- Background music plays the whole time.  
\- The goal is essentially survive as long as possible before all screens get overrun.  
\- no real levels, just infinite survival

**Other details:**  
\- The virus that popped up on the monitors might look something like this:  
\[ ! \] WARNING  
Infection Detected  
\- might have some keywords like ""infection, malware, .exe, virus, office, pc, panic, detected""

I am a little worried this is going to have a few twists and turns but I’ll try to keep it fairly together.

I’m a 30 year old woman but I feel like I am still carrying around baggage from my teen years. I was a bit of a complicated character who was loud, gobby, outspoken and a bit of an edgelord pick me type. Shaved my head at 15, obsessed with Morrissey - just an all round pain in the proverbial.

Understandably, I got people’s backs up. Due to various circumstances I ended up in quite a toxic relationship in my mid to late teens with someone who I look back and realise was abusive, second long term relationship was with someone who cheated and I ended up with an STI (very glam). I spent my early 20s and post uni years drinking quite heavily, dating the wrong people and to be honest I didn’t quite stabilise until Covid hit and I took stock of my life.

Nevertheless I’ve come out of this very okay - got my master’s, bought my own home with no help from family, have a management level job in the public sector and a two year relationship with a man I am going to marry.

Despite the above, there are friends from my teenage years and early twenties who will still see me as the person I was who was a heavy drinker, a loudmouth and a bit of a hot mess. The week before my dad’s wake, I met up with a friend and her fiancé for a coffee with my partner which was used as an opportunity by her to tell my partner how “I really was”. Of course, he didn’t care about me having to get a taxi cleaned once, falling over in a nightclub and a drunken one night stand when I was 19.

There are people from that part of my life I feel like I am on high alert with, trying to prove to them that I am not a mess, I have “calmed down” and that I’m “together” now.

I’m sick of the act. No wonder I always feel like I’m having to be on high alert constantly - I’m not hiding who I am but I am carting around so much shame that I just feel exhausted. So anyways, I’ve just gotten rid of the vast majority of people on my social media. People I knew, people who I saw not six months ago, people who were those I considered to be close friends until recently. I don’t live near these people anymore. I don’t need to be around people who see me as what I was 15 years ago, which wasn’t even a bad person but just a loudmouth. I’ve been punishing myself for years under the guise of “accountability” - but there’s not a lot to punish myself for. Nothing worse than what most people have done. 

There’s no need to keep the relationships going if they drain me mentally. It wasn’t a decision taken lightly and I’ve had months of tears and agonising over moving on from people who were once close to me but to finally close that door feels like a new one has opened and I have more space to give to the friends who see me as I am, who I don’t feel anxious around and to give even more energy to the new friendships to those who have known me as me in my current and best form.

It’s so scary and in my head I feel like the bad guy, but at my big age I do not need to feel crippled under the weight of high school nonsense, either real or imagined. So I’m shedding that now.

1pnhypk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pnhypk/sf_the_foam_sees/,[SF] The Foam Sees,"We were already in Manila by the time the frog started to sweat. Jimmy Funk held the capsule in his lap, wiping condensation from its lid with the hem of his tropical fruit-themed bowler shirt.

“Is it supposed to be glowing yet?” he asked, peering at me above his foggy, horn-rimmed glasses, and under the brim of a straw farmer’s hat.

“Not unless we’re being followed,” I said, checking the rearview mirror of the taxi. The driver was asleep but somehow navigated through the crowded street.

Our goal was simple, supposedly: deliver the frog to the hotel near the Mall of Asia. No further details. Well, maybe a few, but we hardly understood:

“If it sings, run. If it winks, stay still. And don’t drink the chocolate beer.”

Jimmy Funk and I had laughed, then. We weren’t laughing now.

The taxi stopped in front of a building that hadn’t been there ten seconds ago. An old mid-rise with no name, just an engraving of an upside-down question mark over the door.

“This it?” Jimmy Funk asked.

We hurried out of the cab. The driver woke up and started cursing at us in my grandmother’s voice, but in a language she never knew existed.

Jimmy Funk put the frog capsule in his pocket. I had asked him not to, but he insisted it “made his sternum feel complete.”

Well-dressed agents of the Republic of Korea’s National Intelligence Service swarmed us from multiple, but not all, directions as we walked into the hotel lobby.

“Geh-goo-ree! Geh-goo-ree!” they quietly said to one another as they approached.

I only know about four words in Korean. “Frog” is one of them. Don’t ask why. You don’t want to know.

Jimmy Funk, yes, THAT Jimmy Funk, world-famous thespian, was taking a selfie with a fan when the agents surrounded us. The teenage fan disappeared. Literally. They were a ghost, probably.

The agents bowed with respect, to the frog, not us. Though they dared not touch it.

They formed a protective human wall around us, and we were ushered to a secret escalator. They hit no buttons, but it began to move without direction.

We stopped on the fourth floor. The NIS agents held their breath. They were tetraphobic.

Jimmy Funk knew cues better than anyone. I followed him out of the elevator, he had the frog, after all.

The elevator door closed and we were quickly alone. Jimmy Funk, me, and the frog.

Luckily, we needed no further cues. The elevator opened to a penthouse. No room guessing games for us.

I had a mean case of swamp ass from the tropical heat, so I went to clean up in the waterfall shower overlooking the Mall of Asia. I think it was a one-way view. I hope so, anyhow.

When I came out of the bathroom, the frog capsule was on a banana-shaped coffee table… but Jimmy Funk was gone.

I found him hours later on the balcony, dazed, his ridiculous moustache sticky with something brown.

“There’s a place downstairs,” he said, breathing heavily. “Chocolate beer. No tap. It just… appears. You think a mood, and it bubbles up.”

“You drank it?”

“Twice.”

“Jimmy Funk…”

“I know what they said. But listen… it’s not a drink. It’s a memory. You taste things that never happened.”

The frog glowed in its capsule, atop a shelf made from the plank of a haunted Chinese pirate ship (well, a replica).

The second day, Jimmy Funk vanished again. This time for a lot longer.

Become a member
The frog began glowing while looking at itself in a mirror that once belonged to Ferdinand Magellan.

I studied the oddly rhythmic blinking.
“Morse toad… I mean code.”

The frog did not laugh, but the parrot did.

I took the laminated Morse code card from my pocket. Good thing I always carried at least one.

THEY HAVE HIM. STOP DRINKING. THE FOAM SEES.

That night, I left the frog in the care of the penthouse tailor and secretly followed Jimmy Funk on his mysterious journey.

He walked through a hallway that hadn’t existed when we checked in. The air grew cooler the deeper I went, the walls narrowing until it felt like I was walking inside a hamster tube.

He passed through a door marked only with a chalk symbol , a backwards ampersand that looked like melting wax.

I followed.
Well, I tried… but I walked into the wall.

The hallway collapsed behind me.

I returned to the room. The tailor was gone. The cobbler was gone. The frog was gone.

In its place: a single napkin, chocolate-stained, folded neatly.

“Funk has been resettled. You’ll forget soon.”

Frogless, I left the hotel at dawn.

A jeepney somehow dropped me at the airport, even though I never told the driver where I was going.

On the plane, not sure where it was bound, the in-seat menu had only three options:

Chocolate Beer (Warm)
Chocolate Beer (Cold)
Chocolate Beer (Mood-Based)

I declined.
I was still whole then.

Three years later, at the foot of Mount Fuji, I was selling vintage padlocks to tourists (without a license, sshh).

One rainy afternoon, I saw Jimmy Funk again. Or a version of him. He was carrying the cutest frog umbrella.

“You found me” he declared stoically upon approaching me.

“Is it really you?”

“I’m one of them,” he replied. “Maybe the original. Maybe not.”

“What happened to the frog?”

“The real one or the decoy?”

“Which one did we have?”

Jimmy Funk smiled.
“It’s not really chocolate beer. It’s the memory of who you could’ve been, fermented. Every time you drink it, you make a choice. And every choice leaves something behind.”

“I never drank it,” I said.

He tipped his top hat to me.
“Then you’re probably still whole.”

A pause.
The wind shifted.
His spectacles shimmered like a mirror.
Jimmy stood on his tip-toes and vanished for a split second.

“One more thing,” he added.
“You never actually left the hotel.”

Considering switching to Samsung MagicINFO or a budget-friendly signage solution—looking for advice on where to start.

Long Version: I work at a church and we have several Samsung professional TVs throughout the building to show events, promotions, etc. We currently use **5 BrightSign units**, and they have seriously been such an issue since day one. Almost all the problems are **network related**—they don’t connect, don’t update, and are generally a pain because they were **not professionally installed or properly networked,** at least from what I have seen.

The person who originally chose and set up the BrightSigns is our A/V guy (sound and lighting on Sundays). Our IT only worked on them when they were adding it to the network (as far as I know), and the ongoing maintenance and scheduling has ended up with me. I’m not an IT professional, but I’m comfortable with computers and I can usually learn what I need to do to get things going, it just takes me a little longer. (I'm the graphic designer lol)

Since these are **Samsung commercial-grade TVs**, they already have **MagicINFO built in**, so I’m trying to figure out if that’s a better option. I’ve looked into it a bit, but I can’t find a clear “here’s where to start”, especially for someone who isn’t the IT admin.

**My question:**

Should we scrap BrightSign and try to use **MagicINFO** since it’s already on the TVs? If so, where do I actually start (server vs cloud, licensing, setup, etc.)?

OR should we be looking in a completely different direction, keeping in mind that this is a church and we’re **very budget conscious** (we can’t really spend hundreds of dollars a year on a new system)?

For context, our needs are pretty basic: scheduled slides, looping announcements, coffee stand menu boards, simple updates. Nothing fancy.

None of them are married, they enjoy their time golfing or doing whatever they want really.

The uncle I want to get the wallet for is into finance/investing/stocks, etc.. He has the same routine he's had for years... reads newspaper, black coffee... hopefully you guys get the picture.

I want to get him a new wallet as a gift. Preferably a leather bifold that can hold lots of cash. Are there any brands people would recommend for a classy, old school type of wallet?

Thanks!",2,1765829914.0,wallets,5,0.76,False

Now the thing is, im a begginer i dont even work as a designer i just studied and didn't search for a career in this yet. On one hand i dont know how to bring this up to her, i do want to get payed since it's quiet a lot of different srickers i gotta make but i want to charge less from the other designer.

1pnhqgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1pnhqgp/digestive_issues_please_help/,Digestive issues: please help,"I’ve been mostly carnivore for over a year now.

I’ve had digestive trouble for years prior and it got so bad I was willing to try almost anything. This eventually led me to the carnivore diet. Although some would say it’s more Ketovore these days.

I’ve seen some huge benefits to what I’m doing, I have a full page of them, so I’m in no doubt carnivore is better than before.

Lately it seems I can’t get through a single day without diarrhoea. This gives very little warning, and it has put me in some very uncomfortable situations.

My diet is something like this

Meal 1: bacon and eggs

Meal 2: lamb and eggs / burgers and eggs / beef and eggs / tinned fish and eggs

Meal 3: is meat and eggs, it varies what kind

You can probably see a theme here.

I believe I have an allergy to dairy, so that’s very limiting. I take vitamin D3/K2 and Omega from cod liver oil capsules, some other vitamins occasionally like B Complex, Methyl Folate and others.

I have recently quit coffee and thought that was the culprit but apparently not.

I don’t know what to do now, my best theory is related to my bodies ability to process fat.
