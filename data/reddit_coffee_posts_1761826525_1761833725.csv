So I (28M) work remotely and have been going to the same coffee shop every day for like 6 months. I always sit in the same corner spot, order the same oat milk latte, and wear noise-canceling headphones.



Apparently, other regulars started thinking I was some kind of ""productivity guru"" because I'm always there working on my laptop looking focused. People began sitting near me, ordering the same drink, and even copying my setup (laptop, headphones, notepad).



Last week, the barista told me there's now a whole group of people who come in asking for ""the corner guy's usual"" and they've started calling themselves ""The Focused Collective."" They even made a group chat and have been discussing ""my methods.""



The thing is... I'm literally just answering emails and watching TikToks half the time. Yesterday someone asked if they could ""join my movement"" and I panicked and said ""the energy chooses you"" because I didn't know what else to say.



Now there are like 15 people who show up every morning, sit in formation around my table, and silently work while occasionally nodding at me respectfully. My girlfriend thinks it's hilarious but says I need to come clean before someone asks me to lead a seminar.



AITAH for not telling them I'm just a regular guy who likes consistent coffee and good WiFi?

as some of you know, I'm working on a 4K remaster of Alive 2007 Chicago since some months. I originally wanted to finish to project in September, but numerous things, including significant problems with hardware and software and private life, hindered me from finishing the whole thing. Problems with my hardware have increased so much that 4 minutes of rendering using the best and latest AI model take up to 22 hours,  
which entails a huge electricity consumption. So far I was only able to render about 30 out of 130 minutes. This is no longer acceptable for me, and it increases the waiting time for you guys as well, so I wanted to ask you how I should proceed:

A: I use a comparatively inferior AI model that has a more artificial, but clean look than the model I've used so far = decreases rendering time by a lot.

B: I use an AI model that simply cleans up artifacts and upscales the video without revealing new details (detail and resolution will look similar to the source)

C: I completely drop the AI workflow and remaster it using Resolve (adding film grain, artifact removal, color grading = DVD/film look, resolution will look the same as the source)

D: Render the remaining footage in the Topaz cloud, would cost around 200$ to render, support would be greatly appreciated and needed

Write me in the comments what you guys want, if the majority wants me to do option D, I'd ask for your support via Buy-Me-A-Coffee since it costs so much, but if you don't want to spend your money for the project, it'd be completely fine for me, however I wouldn't be able and willing to spend 200$ on my own for it and I'd proceed with Option A, B or C.

I apologize very much again for the lack of updates and progress on this project, but don't worry, I won't give up on it!",3,1761833471.0,DaftPunk,0,1.0,False

Talks about marriage and kids have been coming up, and well, it‚Äôs really made me reflect more. 

A little background. My gf and I got together when I was in college. She had dropped out but we were both working at a food service place, and she was a manager. We both worked long hours (I‚Äôd often work overtime so I could pay for school), and then would hang out after work. A few months into us dating I graduated. It took me about a year to find work with my degree, but eventually I took a teaching position, and after the first year I got a different more high paying job that was Work From Home. I‚Äôve grown significantly in this career, having had 2 raises for each year (first being 13% the second being 10%) as I‚Äôm a top performer. My gf though, always said she would go back to school. But she never has. She has bounced around food service work, and then eventually couldn‚Äôt handle it mentally anymore, quit, and then me and my family found her a WFH job that pays by the task at 12/hr. Since she was going through it at the time, we both agreed the flexibility would be good for her to figure things out. Because it was task based, she could also work whatever hours she wanted. Fast forward 2 years from that moment, and she still works there. Still the same pay. 

My income has gone up, and hers has consistently gone down, and with the rising cost of living, and me taking on more bills (I cover all of our bills besides her car payment), I feel nearly as broke as I was when I was in food service. I make now, starting this year $75k/year, and last year she made around $9-$10k. I can‚Äôt imagine being able to afford kids, or afford a ring, or a wedding, or a house. I‚Äôve worked my ass off to try and get more raises and promotions so we can even think about moving into a house at some point. I am even debating about taking some classes at a local community college so I can apply for a Master‚Äôs to increase my job options and pay. But I just feel so tired, it‚Äôs like I want to do it, but I feel like, I am already doing so much. 

But it isn‚Äôt just because of finances, I handle most of our life admin tasks as well, and I try to do sweet things for her, and I just sometimes wish she would do more of that. For instance two days ago I worked a 15 hour day to try and get a last minute project done for our executives to present to a high profile client. I felt so drained, and I still did all of nightly duties (getting coffee for the morning set up, getting the shower prepared) and she asked me if I had gotten her pajamas, and I said ‚Äúno I didn‚Äôt know what you might want to wear‚Äù and maybe I‚Äôm making it up in my head, but I‚Äôm pretty sure she gave me an annoyed look. She was playing a video game.  That day I woke up at 6:00 AM to work out, do some education (I have been trying to study computer science) and then worked. She slept until about 1 PM. 

I feel like I have all these goals, and she doesn‚Äôt have many. Mostly she just wants to get married and have kids and have a beautiful home. I would like these things too, but I sort of feel like I am the one who is expected to make everything happen. Like I don‚Äôt feel like we are building a life together, but that I am building a life for her. 

There are just so many things I feel like I haven‚Äôt been able to do because in a way, we‚Äôve been waiting for her to ‚Äúfigure out what she wants.‚Äù Like, I wanted to Travel a bit before turning 30. I have gotten more interested in Tech (I‚Äôm in design) and this blend of Tech & Design, that makes me want to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree. I wanted to feel like I could financially breathe for once, which I haven‚Äôt felt for almost my entire life (except for when I first got my Teaching job). Like I feel like my life has been struggle since forever, and I just really would like to not struggle for a couple years before adding new stressors like a house and kids.

I‚Äôve always wanted to be able to give any future kids I had a life I didn‚Äôt get to have. My parents had me right at the end of high school, and so things were financial difficult in my upbringing. My parents worked hard, but I see the toll it took on them, and I see the things we weren‚Äôt able to do. I appreciate all that they did, but I always thought, I have an opportunity to plan this out, making smart decisions, and create financial stability for myself and any future children I have, as I didn‚Äôt have a kid as young as they did. 

It feels mean to say this, but I feel like in a way, sometimes I do have a dependent already, and I feel like even thinking about having kids is like asking a single parent to have another one. I feel like that‚Äôs mean to say, but I feel like I carry the load and all the responsibility for our future. And I‚Äôm just tired. 

My gf and I used to fight early on in our relationship, but she said she had trauma, and it was things that were triggering her. We worked through it. This year though, she had a psychotic break that was extremely traumatic, and it‚Äôs sort of derailed a lot of things. We moved back in with my parents (it was a very rapid move so I had to take on some debt to make it happen) as she needed to be around people for stability (therapist said it was a good idea (though she doesn‚Äôt do therapy anymore)) and I guess this gave me enough of a view to see that, some of our issues we had, weren‚Äôt normal. That not even ‚Äútrauma‚Äù could explain some of them. I realized I had been silencing myself about almost everything. This year I have been more outspoken. And because of that, I‚Äôve almost ended the relationship twice. One was because I told her, very vulnerably, that when we would fight or when I could feel a fight coming I would get alerts from my Apple Watch about my heart rate and my body would start having tremors. This made me afraid to talk to her about things. She actually fought with me about it and was angry at me for it. I threw in the towel, as it was really hard for me to tell her about that to begin with. However, she camped outside my parent‚Äôs house for hours until we eventually talked. I used this to say what ways the relationship needed to change. Since that and one other time where things were at a breaking point, things have gotten a lot better in terms of conflict. But in terms of job & future stuff it‚Äôs the same. 

I can‚Äôt help but sometimes think she is holding me back. I really hate thinking that, but I just think about the weight and stress that would be lifted off of me. I love her, I just wish she would help lift some of this stress, so I wasn‚Äôt feeling so exhausted by it. I also want to keep moving in life, you know hit the next milestone. But I can‚Äôt even see a timeline for it since it is all primarily on me to make happen. 

I guess my question is, how do I ask my gf to grow up a bit more, and help build our future, but also get her to really understand that? I just can‚Äôt see it being possible to do it on my own. 

TLDR: I feel like I am responsible for building mine and my gfs future, and I don‚Äôt know how to get her to understand I can‚Äôt do it alone. ",2,1761833415.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I was wondering why my coffee taste profile would change continuously over a period of time and finally I think i discovered the reason behind it.

When changing my filter granules (Aarke Pure) my coffee would taste weak and not as flavorful as in a week of usage.

Could it be that my water is too soft? In Munich the water is pretty hard (16 dH) but after using the filter I find it to be extremely soft.

So is there something like too soft and thats why the flavor gets more intense after using the filter for a week?

1ok0pkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ok0pkx/how_do_i_27_m_get_my_gf_24_f_to_understand_that_i/,How do I (27 M) get my gf (24 F) to understand that I can‚Äôt do it all on my own.,"Me (27 M) and my gf (24 F) have been together for 4 years now. Talks about marriage and kids have been coming up, and well, it‚Äôs really made me reflect more. 

A little background. My gf and I got together when I was in college. She had dropped out but we were both working at a food service place, and she was a manager. We both worked long hours (I‚Äôd often work overtime so I could pay for school), and then would hang out after work. A few months into us dating I graduated. It took me about a year to find work with my degree, but eventually I took a teaching position, and after the first year I got a different more high paying job that was Work From Home. I‚Äôve grown significantly in this career, having had 2 raises for each year (first being 13% the second being 10%) as I‚Äôm a top performer. My gf though, always said she would go back to school. But she never has. She has bounced around food service work, and then eventually couldn‚Äôt handle it mentally anymore, quit, and then me and my family found her a WFH job that pays by the task at 12/hr. Since she was going through it at the time, we both agreed the flexibility would be good for her to figure things out. Because it was task based, she could also work whatever hours she wanted. Fast forward 2 years from that moment, and she still works there. Still the same pay. 

My income has gone up, and hers has consistently gone down, and with the rising cost of living, and me taking on more bills (I cover all of our bills besides her car payment), I feel nearly as broke as I was when I was in food service. I make now, starting this year $75k/year, and last year she made around $9-$10k. I can‚Äôt imagine being able to afford kids, or afford a ring, or a wedding, or a house. I‚Äôve worked my ass off to try and get more raises and promotions so we can even think about moving into a house at some point. I am even debating about taking some classes at a local community college so I can apply for a Master‚Äôs to increase my job options and pay. But I just feel so tired, it‚Äôs like I want to do it, but I feel like, I am already doing so much. 

But it isn‚Äôt just because of finances, I handle most of our life admin tasks as well, and I try to do sweet things for her, and I just sometimes wish she would do more of that. For instance two days ago I worked a 15 hour day to try and get a last minute project done for our executives to present to a high profile client. I felt so drained, and I still did all of nightly duties (getting coffee for the morning set up, getting the shower prepared) and she asked me if I had gotten her pajamas, and I said ‚Äúno I didn‚Äôt know what you might want to wear‚Äù and maybe I‚Äôm making it up in my head, but I‚Äôm pretty sure she gave me an annoyed look. She was playing a video game.  That day I woke up at 6:00 AM to work out, do some education (I have been trying to study computer science) and then worked. She slept until about 1 PM. 

I feel like I have all these goals, and she doesn‚Äôt have many. Mostly she just wants to get married and have kids and have a beautiful home. I would like these things too, but I sort of feel like I am the one who is expected to make everything happen. Like I don‚Äôt feel like we are building a life together, but that I am building a life for her. 

There are just so many things I feel like I haven‚Äôt been able to do because in a way, we‚Äôve been waiting for her to ‚Äúfigure out what she wants.‚Äù Like, I wanted to Travel a bit before turning 30. I have gotten more interested in Tech (I‚Äôm in design) and this blend of Tech & Design, that makes me want to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree. I wanted to feel like I could financially breathe for once, which I haven‚Äôt felt for almost my entire life (except for when I first got my Teaching job). Like I feel like my life has been struggle since forever, and I just really would like to not struggle for a couple years before adding new stressors like a house and kids.

I‚Äôve always wanted to be able to give any future kids I had a life I didn‚Äôt get to have. My parents had me right at the end of high school, and so things were financial difficult in my upbringing. My parents worked hard, but I see the toll it took on them, and I see the things we weren‚Äôt able to do. I appreciate all that they did, but I always thought, I have an opportunity to plan this out, making smart decisions, and create financial stability for myself and any future children I have, as I didn‚Äôt have a kid as young as they did. 

It feels mean to say this, but I feel like in a way, sometimes I do have a dependent already, and I feel like even thinking about having kids is like asking a single parent to have another one. I feel like that‚Äôs mean to say, but I feel like I carry the load and all the responsibility for our future. And I‚Äôm just tired. 

My gf and I used to fight early on in our relationship, but she said she had trauma, and it was things that were triggering her. We worked through it. This year though, she had a psychotic break that was extremely traumatic, and it‚Äôs sort of derailed a lot of things. We moved back in with my parents (it was a very rapid move so I had to take on some debt to make it happen) as she needed to be around people for stability (therapist said it was a good idea (though she doesn‚Äôt do therapy anymore)) and I guess this gave me enough of a view to see that, some of our issues we had, weren‚Äôt normal. That not even ‚Äútrauma‚Äù could explain some of them. I realized I had been silencing myself about almost everything. This year I have been more outspoken. And because of that, I‚Äôve almost ended the relationship twice. One was because I told her, very vulnerably, that when we would fight or when I could feel a fight coming I would get alerts from my Apple Watch about my heart rate and my body would start having tremors. This made me afraid to talk to her about things. She actually fought with me about it and was angry at me for it. I threw in the towel, as it was really hard for me to tell her about that to begin with. However, she camped outside my parent‚Äôs house for hours until we eventually talked. I used this to say what ways the relationship needed to change. Since that and one other time where things were at a breaking point, things have gotten a lot better in terms of conflict. But in terms of job & future stuff it‚Äôs the same. 

I can‚Äôt help but sometimes think she is holding me back. I really hate thinking that, but I just think about the weight and stress that would be lifted off of me. I love her, I just wish she would help lift some of this stress, so I wasn‚Äôt feeling so exhausted by it. I also want to keep moving in life, you know hit the next milestone. But I can‚Äôt even see a timeline for it since it is all primarily on me to make happen. 

I guess my question is, how do I ask my gf to grow up a bit more, and help build our future, but also get her to really understand that? I just can‚Äôt see it being possible to do it on my own. 

TLDR: I feel like I am responsible for building mine and my gfs future, and I don‚Äôt know how to get her to understand I can‚Äôt do it alone. ",2,1761833280.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1ok0p5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1ok0p5h/ranting_about_my_todays_incredibly_hectic_and/,Ranting about my today‚Äôs incredibly hectic and slightly worst day,"So I woke up around 7:30 today. From 7:45 to 8:30 I was on a video call with my girlfriend. After that I started getting ready for the day and by 9:15 I headed out for the office.

But it was raining so hard. And the funny thing is I‚Äôve always been such a lazy person. I usually stay home all day whenever it rains make myself a cup of coffee or tea and enjoy those cozy rainy vibes. But today was different. For the first time ever I actually went out to work while it was raining continuously. It felt so weird like oh my god I really miss those cozy days at home.

Anyway my first stop was the tax office in Koteshwor. But once I reached there I found out that the office had been moved to Pepsi-Cola. So I had to drive all the way back again. By the time I got there I was completely drenched my raincoat didn‚Äôt really do its job. I stopped by a small tea stall in PepsiCola and had a cup of tea there my first meal of the day.

After that I headed to my main office in Tripureshwor and reached around 12 p.m. As soon as I got there my boss asked me to go to the airport to deliver a cargo document because the flight was at 2 p.m. I had to rush immediately to make sure the document got there in time.

Once that was done I went back toward Koteshwor and from there I tried to get a ride back to Tripureshwor. But of course since it was raining heavily, I couldn‚Äôt find any Pathao InDriver or yango. All the drivers seemed to be hiding from the rain. So I ended up taking a bus that went to Bagbazar. From there I had to walk all the way to Tripureshwor cause again I couldn‚Äôt find any drivers tho I increased the ride price so high. 

And that‚Äôs not all when I finally reached the office I found out no one had informed me that I needed to collect bank statements. So I had to go around to five different bank branches to get them.  

And when I finally collected all the bank statements and was ready to grab a ride back to the office my phone  switched off. I couldn‚Äôt even contact the driver who had already accepted my ride request so once again I had to walk all the way from Pulchowk to Tripureshwor

By the end of the day I had walked around 12 km. My right knee was already injured and was 95% healed but now it feels like I‚Äôve hurt it again.

On my way back home I suddenly had to pee so badly. For a second, I genuinely thought I might pee my pants. I even considered going by the side of the road near Jadibuti. But somehow i managed to hold it in and found a nearby caf√© instead. I used their washroom and ordered a coffee and that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm sitting right now, writing this rant.

Honestly every time it rains something bad happens to me. I‚Äôve been noticing this since grade 5 and the story‚Äôs always the same. 

every time it rains my day somehow goes horribly wrong. I swear it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm cursed by the rain. But whenever it‚Äôs sunny like sky‚Äôs bright and the sun‚Äôs blazing my days just automatically turn out great. I‚Äôve actually been noticing this pattern since grade 5 ",1,1761833252.0,NepalSocial,1,1.0,False

So far it's just been things like going to bars, coffee shops, going on days out to different towns etc. One thing I've been thinking about doing is a solo holiday.

My girlfriend and I go on holiday at least once a year, it‚Äôs normally just one bit a couple of times we‚Äôve been on two. We live in the UK so our holidays have always been different European cities.

I was looking this week about doing a trip in the new year on my own. I'm looking at 4-5 nights away. I mentioned my plan to my gf and she said she thinks it's weird that I want to go away on my own when I'm in a relationship.

I pointed out being in a relationship doesn't mean you have to do everything together. She asked what it would mean for our trips and I said it'll just mean we only have one holiday next year.

She said our trips shouldn't be reduced just because I decide to go away but I just reminded her we haven't even got anything planned for next year so it's not like I'm cancelling already made plans.

She just said I shouldn't be doing it and that going away on my own isn't something I should be considering when I'm in a relationship.

Does anyone have any other perspectives on this or have any advice on how best to approach the situation?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1ok0jtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LOONAmemes/comments/1ok0jtc/searching_meaning_of_life/,searching meaning of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I GC'd the project myself and did a bunch of the work. I'll probably finish out close to $115-$120 a square foot. Do you think I saved any money or did I just pay to lose sleep for the last year an a half?,"We bought a 1972 walkout ranch and pretty much gutted the entire place. I live in an expensive city of a low(ish) cost of living state in the midwest. We bought the property because it sits on 3.5 acres *just* on the outside of town. Houses around us are expensive -- there are several 1M+ homes with more being built. We bought the house for 450k and it's about 2,500 sqft.

Here is what it was before: 

* 3 bedroom (2, really) 2 bath home
  * One bathroom was upstairs and was adjoined to the master bedroom but served the entire floor
  * One ""bedroom"" was downstairs but had no closet and it's egress was a door. 
  * The other bathroom was downstairs and was located on the ""walkout"" wall of the basement
* Dated kitchen with old, low end appliances
* Laminate and carpet flooring
* Popcorn ceiling upstairs, drop ceiling downstairs
* Utility room that doubled as a laundry room
* Enclosed 3 seasons porch

As part of our remodel we: 

**Bones**

* Converted to a 4 bedroom (all real) 3 bath house
* New plumbing
* New furnace/AC
* New tankless water heater
* New water treatment (on a well)
* New insulation in the basement, kitchen, and dining room

**Upstairs Bathrooms**

* Converted the upstairs bathroom into a master bathroom with a soaking tub with tile, a double vanity, and a water closet
* Added a second bathroom upstairs with a tub and tile

**Upstairs Finishes**

* Replaced all carpet and laminate with high end LVP (karndean). 
* Tore down the wall to the sunroom and converted it to a conditioned dining room
* Removed popcorn ceiling
* Upgraded solid core doors and more modern millwork (trim/casing/crown)

**Down Stairs Beds + Baths**

* Relocated plumbing downstairs to move the mechanical room and bathroom off the ""walkout"" wall to the back corner of the basement
* Added a second bedroom where the old bathroom and mechanical rooms were.
* Added 20 sqft of windows (5'x4') to both downstairs bedrooms
* Added a dedicated laundry room
* Did not complete basement bathroom (needs flooring and shower)

**Downstairs finishes**

* Replaced 5 bad windows with Marvin fiberglass windows
* Replaced the walkout door with a fiberglass french patio door
* Redid all the drywall and added drywall ceilings
* All new electrical with recessed lighting and accent lighting 
* Upgraded solid core doors and more modern millwork (trim/casing/crown)

**Kitchen**

* Added a walnut coffee bar/pantry with about 65 cubic feet of storage (6' wall of floor to ceiling cabinets with a 3.5' cutout for a coffee bar)
* Custom painted cabinets, made out of solid wood and 3/5"" ply
* Quarts countertops
* High end 36"" stove (bluestar)
* Mid to high appliances (GE profile)

**Misc**

* Updated a lot of the lighting to use recessed cans, wall sconces, pendants, etc.
* Extended a few walls or built new ones to hide structural components (posts) or increase the size of rooms (family rooms)
* Textured and painted everything to blend old vs new work

I'm sorry I don't have any finished pictures, we aren't quote there yet. Pretty much everything has been paid for and the next 3 weeks are stacked with trades coming in to do finish work. I'm just curious about how our spending stacks up to the alternative of paying a GC to do it all for us.",1,1761832856.0,HomeImprovement,1,1.0,False

I was recently diagnosed with diabetes (type 2) after a routine health checkup, and it came as a complete shock. I felt totally fine outwardly, but my HbA1c came back at 11. I've since started treatment and made changes to my diet and lifestyle ‚Äî currently focusing on controlling my food intake and going to the gym regularly.

One thing I‚Äôm really struggling with is giving up my usual sweet hot beverages ‚Äî I used to have coffee and hot chocolate regularly, and they really helped me feel fresh and focused during the day. Now, with the need to avoid sugar, I‚Äôm trying to find safe and satisfying replacements.

I found products like like Horlicks Diabetes Plus,Protinex Diabetes Care and Ensure Diabetes Care on instamart and all the medical stores. My doctor said it could be safe but to try it with water rather than milk. 

Has anyone here tried these as replacements for regular coffee/hot drinks? Are they actually safe and helpful for diabetics, or should I be cautious?

I also tried coffee with stevia, but it gave me a bad stomach almost immediately. I‚Äôve heard this can be a side effect ‚Äî has anyone else experienced this? I am afraid to try it again.

Additionally, are there any good tasting whey proteins that are diabetic-safe and can be consumed warm, like a hot beverage?

Lastly, I‚Äôm still mentally adjusting to cutting out sweets, chocolates, and fruit juices. I'd really appreciate recommendations for:

* Diabetic-friendly snacks, dessert alternatives (like Greek Yogurt) 
* Trusted brands or diabetic friendly products available in India that you personally like

Hi,
Five days ago, I had a severe panic attack and experienced pain in my neck during it. The pain scared me, but it went away mostly by the next day, leaving some mild soreness that I thought was muscle strain.
That night, I started having panic attacks again due to the pain, and I noticed some discomfort on the outside of my left arm. Yesterday, I developed headaches, pulsing sensations in my shoulders and neck (especially behind my ears), and some pressure on back of my head. I can visibly see my pulse in my neck when standing up, which worries me.
I feel mostly okay during the day, but I keep noticing neck pain or tightness that triggers anxiety. I haven‚Äôt told anyone yet because I‚Äôm scared it might be something serious.
Could this be caused by anxiety, nicotine/caffeine use, or something that needs medical attention? Should I talk to a doctor in person?

Anyway recently its been so triggering because he has been acting extra nice to my sisters and by that i mean the bare minimum of hugging them or asking one of them if she wants coffee in the morning and it has been triggering me so much because i know that is not his normal behaviour and its making me feel so confused because he can do a couple nice things then a second later turn to a monster , anyway they are renting a caravan this weekend and my mum and sisters want me to go with them but he will be there too obvs and i just dont want to be seeing him so much even though i already see him in the house but atleast then i leave and go to my classes or just go to my room or put music on and space out , anyway my mum told me that the previous times they went when they are out walking he would always end up walking way ahead of them and leaving them behind anyway and that he would mostly eat on his own especially if it is late he will sleep before everyone and eat on his own so she said that if I go it will only mostly be me and her and my sisters 

But i am just worried about going with them then it just being me having to bury myself in my music to not focus on him , but if i go and he actually isnt around much then its some good time to spend with my sisters and my mum but idk what to do , i would miss like 7ish hours of kickboxing and karate training if i go with them too and i have been offered a shift for saturday and need the money so will also miss out on money so idk if it is worth it , 

i do want to spend time with my sisters and one of them was a bit annoyed and said to me i cant keep saying we dont do stuff together then not go when i am invited but like i just hate the sight of that man , and my sisters and mum enable his toxic behaviour so much that it almost confuses me

I want advice on a gift that‚Äî besides being wallet-friendly‚Äî has longevity and is creative. 

Context: Hi, posting on a throwaway because my bf's a reddit junkie as well and knows all my other accounts. Our anniversary's coming in just a bit over one month, and I thought about planning on what to get him. 

I'll share what I can, but not too specific as I don't want him to somehow know that this is me. 
Things to consider:

1. A planned date being the actual gift is sweet, and also what I would want, but the anniversary is near a certain ""family-time"" holiday. We're also both still in uni, with a course that barely gives us time, so we can't celebrate earlier than the actual anniversary either. 

2. By well-off, while I certainly don't mean contractor level rich, he's still rich rich. Like, random stationary items for 4- to 5-digit pesos rich. But it's not to show off; not all his stuff are like that, he just buys stuff he happens to like regardless of price. 

3. Materially, he's interested in watches, pens, and coffee (he makes them himself with his own setup). However, I can't gift him any of these because what he has are on the high-end range, which I cannot afford. 

Previous Attempts (?) My ideas... So far:
1. A letter - he wrote me letters himself, so I'd like to write him one as well, but I'm worried it would be too predictable. Also, I get frustrated too easily and all my previous attempts were crumpled up. Plus, we basically say everything in our hearts to each other whenever we have the chance to, so I don't know wanna be redundant in a letter, haha. 

2. Dried flowers - I haven't attempted these yet, but I like the thought of going through the effort of making something pretty for him. Plus, they last. But I don't know if he would even like these. He's a very direct person on what he can appreciate and not appreciate. Well, even though he says he loves anything that's from me, I want to give him something he can actually use though. 

None of these are actually useful in a practical sense though. I'd appreciate ideas on that as well. 

I apologize if there are parts where I don't make any sense, I'm half-asleep right now. Any advice is appreciated, and please be kind. I know gifts aren't the most important thing in a relationship, but he buys me food and gifts every now and then, and I want to give him something nice for a year of handling me lol. Plus, both of us get decent grades. I deserve to be just a bit relationship oa, haha.

We‚Äôve built something powerful - a suite of machine learning‚Äìdriven services (personalized search, recommendation engines, forecasting models) that plug into any business in just a few lines of code.  
Our technology is fast, smart, and goal-oriented: businesses can tell it what they want (‚Äúincrease profit margin,‚Äù ‚Äúmake users click the first result‚Äù), and our ML does the rest and is learning how to get there.  
Now we‚Äôre looking for our first Sales & Business Development Lead, the person who will take this from brilliant prototype to market traction. If that excites you, read on.  
What You‚Äôll Do  
Be the frontline of our go-to-market push: find and close the first key clients (retail, e-commerce, or any business with a searchable ecosystem).  
Build relationships, pitch the product, and tailor how we talk about our solutions to fit the client‚Äôs goals.  
Help us shape our sales motion. We‚Äôll listen to your ideas on what works.  
Work directly with the team. No bureaucracy, no playbook yet. You‚Äôll write it with us.  
Choose your own approach, tools, and tactics. Cold outreach? Partnerships? Demos over coffee? Whatever gets us results.  
Compensation (Flexible & Negotiable)  
We‚Äôre open to shaping the deal around the right person. Some models we‚Äôve considered:  
Commission-only: 10‚Äì15% of total contract value per closed deal.  
Base + commission: modest base, with tiered commissions (e.g., 8% up to $25k/month, 12% beyond that).  
Performance accelerator: higher % once you hit predefined milestones (e.g., 3‚Äì5 new clients).  
We‚Äôre flexible and transparent. We‚Äôll design a setup that rewards results and feels motivating.  
Who You Are  
You‚Äôve sold B2B SaaS or software solutions before. You know the rhythm, outreach, pitch, close, nurture.  
You understand how to sell complex technology simply and make ML or data-driven tools sound like ROI, not rocket science.  
You‚Äôre independent, self-driven, and confident. We don‚Äôt have a big sales structure (yet) so this is a big one.  
You thrive in startup environments where things move fast and creativity wins.  
You‚Äôre remote, async, and outcome-oriented. You care more about results than meetings.  
What‚Äôs In It For You  
Freedom: you‚Äôll design your own process. No scripts, no micro-management.  
Impact: you‚Äôll be the first sales hire. Everything you build becomes part of the foundation.  
Growth: as we scale, this role can evolve into Sales Leadership or Business Development Head.  
Upside: the contracts are large, and so are the commissions.  
Flexibility: work when and where you‚Äôre most effective.

As the title says, I am looking to connect with new friends for online chat. All that I ask is that you be around my age, within reason. Oh and also, if you have any shared interests, that would be an added bonus as well.

1ok0cmb,https://i.redd.it/2gfz7e8f89yf1.jpeg,Day 1,"Woke up yesterday morning and started tearing this apart. Got to the spaghetti of wires inside and found myself a little intimidated by the idea of cutting anything, but I called a friend and offered him a cup of coffee to show me the way. After that, it took a little courage to start sanding. 

Once the sanding was over, I knew I had crossed the threshold and there wasn‚Äôt any going back. So I grabbed a ratchet strap and some zip ties and rigged a hanging unit together by draping it over a big metal fence post I had lying around, stuck it in my wood pile and it was secure enough to get to work.  I blew the dust off and used some cleaner to make sure to get anything the canned air missed. Hung it up, and started spraying.

Now we‚Äôre about a can of heirloom white into the project and I‚Äôm gonna spend a couple days sanding it with a finer grit and reapplying the color. Then clear and polish.

Things I learned: 

hang your guitar high, the part I wasted the most paint and time on was the bottom, and that is the one area where the coverage isn‚Äôt complete.

Wiring is scary, but I feel like swing all that stuff pulled out gave me some perspective and I am confident that soldering can‚Äôt been too difficult to get the hang of.

Guitars are mainly just a hunk of wood and screws, it‚Äôs pretty hard to mess things up beyond repair with some sandpaper and a can of paint.

I am in no way handy and kinda feel like I leveled up, thanks yall! I‚Äôll keep documenting my journey for those who wanna keep up with it!

If you‚Äôre reading this and, like me, had apprehension about pulling out a screwdriver, just do it, call a friend, watch some videos, and do it! It‚Äôs so empowering and if I can learn a new set of skills at as I careen closer to 40, do it, you can too.

1ok0bkw,https://tipstor.com/copenhagen-in-denmark/,Copenhagen in Denmark,"Copenhagen is what happens when imagination and appetite get drunk together and decide to build a city. It‚Äôs a place where sustainability wears designer clothes, bicycles rule the streets, and every plate looks like it belongs in an art gallery curated by Vikings. The air hums with quiet confidence. The kind born from centuries of craftsmanship, cold winters, and the national belief that food should tell a story.

The day begins in Torvehallerne, Copenhagen‚Äôs gleaming temple of food. It‚Äôs part marketplace, part pilgrimage site for the hungry faithful. The air is heavy with roasted coffee, smoked fish, and freshly baked rye. Counters gleam under soft lights, each one guarded by a local artisan with the stoicism of someone who knows their product could convert the most skeptical traveler. There‚Äôs sm√∏rrebr√∏d in every direction. Open-faced sandwiches layered with pickled herring, roast beef, or shrimp so fresh they seem to twitch with the scent of the North Sea. Each bite is a declaration of Denmark‚Äôs culinary gospel. Simple and honest ingredients elevated to near-religious perfection.

The adventure stretches beyond the city‚Äôs sleek streets. Just a short drive outside Copenhagen, organic farms dot the countryside like green jewels. Here, farmers talk about soil with the passion poets reserve for love. Visitors can join harvest tours, pick their own berries, or watch cheese being coaxed into shape from fresh milk still warm from the morning‚Äôs milking. The air is crisp, the food is pure, and the entire experience feels like a quiet rebellion against fast living. Every forkful of farm-fresh produce, be it heirloom carrots, tangy skyr, or creamy butter, tastes like a reminder that simplicity never went out of style.

Copenhagen doesn‚Äôt stop at food. It‚Äôs built for play, too. A day trip to LEGOLAND transforms nostalgia into architecture. Towers of color rise against Scandinavian skies, and even the most stoic adults can‚Äôt resist the pull of childlike wonder. It‚Äôs chaotic and beautiful, an echo of Denmark‚Äôs creative soul made tangible in plastic bricks and grinning faces. Back in the city, adventure takes quieter forms. Gliding through the canals on a kayak, pedaling past royal palaces, or losing track of time in the narrow, and graffiti-splashed lanes of the N√∏rrebro district.

When the sun drops low and the city begins to glow, Copenhagen‚Äôs food scene morphs into something ethereal. Michelin stars twinkle across the skyline, but even the humblest bistros offer revelations on a plate. Locals crowd into candlelit spaces, sipping aquavit and trading stories over platters of Nordic seafood and bowls of foraged greens. The beer flows cold and bitter, brewed in small batches by people who treat hops like holy scripture. Dessert might come in the form of rhubarb tart or chocolate made from cacao sourced through fair-trade alchemy, each bite ending the day with quiet triumph.

The best season to visit is from late spring through early autumn, when the city breathes with long daylight hours, farmers‚Äô markets overflow with color, and the air carries a faint scent of salt from the Baltic Sea. Copenhagen feels alive in every sense. An open-air manifesto on how to live well, eat honestly, and find joy in the balance between chaos and calm.

It‚Äôs not just a city. It‚Äôs a living feast. A place that invites you to taste, explore, and play, all in one go. Copenhagen doesn‚Äôt ask for admiration. It earns it, one perfect bite of sm√∏rrebr√∏d at a time.

I've just put my 2 weeks notice at my job. 

This place was a land of possibilities, archclients and everlasting coffee.

But then there was fire (war, incompetent politicians with tax increase and the impending coming of holidays), and with fire came disparity, and drove the clients to be more considerate with their expenses.

During the rule of the primordial dragons, they didn't take the warnings into account and when Gwin (ptwin) light the first flame, they fell. 

I work at a somewhat big interior design studio and for about 2 months we didn't get any new customers. Last week we finished everything for current projects and now we have some for next year. This week was so slow and so toxic , owners started to piss at us because they don't have money to pay us.

I stayed on Reddit constantly and searched for new ways to play my comfort game, dark souls.

I used to play it when I was down, but now I am going to play it happy, because I will have time and I escaped real life izalith.

I think it's time for a full faith build, haven't done it yet.

Don't forget, getting hollow somewhere means getting branded elsewhere. Already landed a job for next year. I will take the remaining 2 months to reflect and gather myself.

About five days ago, I had a really bad panic attack and felt some pain in my neck that scared me a lot. The next day, I felt mostly okay, just some lingering pain, and I thought it might be strained muscles or something like that.
That night, though, I started having panic attacks again because of the pain. I also began feeling some pain on the outside of my left arm and my shoulders, but I eventually managed to fall asleep.
Yesterday, things got worse I started having really bad headaches, pulsing sensations in my neck (especially behind my ears), and even some pressure or weird feelings on the back of my head. I can literally see my pulse in the neck when standing up, which freaks me out even more.
I haven‚Äôt told anyone about this yet, but I‚Äôve been thinking it might have something to do with my lifestyle. I use nicotine pouches pretty regularly, drink a lot of coffee, and have a pretty messed-up sleep schedule. Still, I‚Äôm only 17, and this whole thing is really scaring me.
During the day, I usually feel okay except for the neck pain or pressure that comes and goes. I just can‚Äôt tell if this is anxiety causing all these physical symptoms or if it‚Äôs something more serious and I should tell someone and go see a doctor.",3,1761832342.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

I GC'd the project myself and did a bunch of the work. I'll probably finish out close to $115-$120 a square foot. Do you think I saved any money or did I just pay to lose sleep for the last year an a half?,"We bought a 1972 walkout ranch and pretty much gutted the entire place. I live in an expensive city of a low(ish) cost of living state in the midwest. We bought the property because it sits on 3.5 acres *just* on the outside of town. Houses around us are expensive -- there are several 1M+ homes with more being built. We bought the house for 450k and it's about 2,500 sqft.

Here is what it was before: 

* 3 bedroom (2, really) 2 bath home
  * One bathroom was upstairs and was adjoined to the master bedroom but served the entire floor
  * One ""bedroom"" was downstairs but had no closet and it's egress was a door. 
  * The other bathroom was downstairs and was located on the ""walkout"" wall of the basement
* Dated kitchen with old, low end appliances
* Laminate and carpet flooring
* Popcorn ceiling upstairs, drop ceiling downstairs
* Utility room that doubled as a laundry room
* Enclosed 3 seasons porch

As part of our remodel we: 

**Bones**

* Converted to a 4 bedroom (all real) 3 bath house
* New plumbing
* New furnace/AC
* New tankless water heater
* New water treatment (on a well)
* New insulation in the basement, kitchen, and dining room

**Upstairs Bathrooms**

* Converted the upstairs bathroom into a master bathroom with a soaking tub with tile, a double vanity, and a water closet
* Added a second bathroom upstairs with a tub and tile

**Upstairs Finishes**

* Replaced all carpet and laminate with high end LVP (karndean). 
* Tore down the wall to the sunroom and converted it to a conditioned dining room
* Removed popcorn ceiling
* Upgraded solid core doors and more modern millwork (trim/casing/crown)

**Down Stairs Beds + Baths**

* Relocated plumbing downstairs to move the mechanical room and bathroom off the ""walkout"" wall to the back corner of the basement
* Added a second bedroom where the old bathroom and mechanical rooms were.
* Added 20 sqft of windows (5'x4') to both downstairs bedrooms
* Added a dedicated laundry room
* Did not complete basement bathroom (needs flooring and shower)

**Downstairs finishes**

* Replaced 5 bad windows with Marvin fiberglass windows
* Replaced the walkout door with a fiberglass french patio door
* Redid all the drywall and added drywall ceilings
* All new electrical with recessed lighting and accent lighting 
* Upgraded solid core doors and more modern millwork (trim/casing/crown)

**Kitchen**

* Added a walnut coffee bar/pantry with about 65 cubic feet of storage (6' wall of floor to ceiling cabinets with a 3.5' cutout for a coffee bar)
* Custom painted cabinets, made out of solid wood and 3/5"" ply
* Quarts countertops
* High end 36"" stove (bluestar)
* Mid to high appliances (GE profile)

**Misc**

* Updated a lot of the lighting to use recessed cans, wall sconces, pendants, etc.
* Extended a few walls or built new ones to hide structural components (posts) or increase the size of rooms (family rooms)
* Textured and painted everything to blend old vs new work

I'm sorry I don't have any finished pictures, we aren't quote there yet. Pretty much everything has been paid for and the next 3 weeks are stacked with trades coming in to do finish work. I'm just curious about how our spending stacks up to the alternative of paying a GC to do it all for us.",1,1761832310.0,Renovations,1,1.0,False

Almost a year ago i noticed that they wouldn't text in the gc if i didn't and they would take hours to respond, and this was a pattern. During the summer, not a single call, i was trying to keep the gc alive but it was in vain. Then, I got into a relationship with my best friend (21 M) and this got kinda busy. I was trying to balance work in a different town with no phone signal, my relationship, my declining mental health and all my friends including them.
Today, after two weeks of me not sending anything nor searching for them, i met one of them randomly. She said something along the lines of ""We haven't seen you in forever"" and I said ""You didn't even look for me"" in a casual tone. I suggested we go get coffee since there was plenty of time till her class, but she said no.
When i got home my phone was bombarded with texts. The two of them were texting in the gc. Saying things like ""It was very rude and unacceptable to say that"" referring to me saying ""you didn't even look for me"". They implied that i was badmouthing them, since they saw some irrelevant reposts on my tiktok, and that since I wasn't mentally well, should've talked to them about it.
This kept on going for quite some time, till i felt dizzy and realised i was going to have a panic attack. I sat down and tried to relax. Right now im alright. My last message to them was ""If I say anything else, I'll repeat myself, so just tell me how you want to move on from here"".

I've tried L'Occitane in the past and always found their products too fragranced, but I don't think I'd mind that if it's just in a shower gel.

So far it's just been things like going to bars, coffee shops, going on days out to different towns etc. One thing I've been thinking about doing is a solo holiday.

My girlfriend and I go on holiday at least once a year, it‚Äôs normally just one bit a couple of times we‚Äôve been on two. We live in the UK so our holidays have always been different European cities.

I was looking this week about doing a trip in the new year on my own. I'm looking at 4-5 nights away. I mentioned my plan to my gf and she said she thinks it's weird that I want to go away on my own when I'm in a relationship.

I pointed out being in a relationship doesn't mean you have to do everything together. She asked what it would mean for our trips and I said it'll just mean we only have one holiday next year.

She said our trips shouldn't be reduced just because I decide to go away but I just reminded her we haven't even got anything planned for next year so it's not like I'm cancelling already made plans.

She just said I shouldn't be doing it and that going away on my own isn't something I should be considering when I'm in a relationship.

I wanted to share my story, which is definitely a ""work in progress.""

A little background: I'm a full-stack developer with 8+ years of experience, three of those as a Team Leader. Like many of you, I've always wanted to build my own ""thing.""

My career plan was simple: work hard, get promoted to management (Team Leader), learn the ""business"" skills, and then launch my company. I did exactly that. I worked hard, became a Team Leader, and learned a *ton*... but not what I expected.



# The Management Fallacy



Being a Team Lead taught me invaluable lessons about managing people, building culture, retaining key players, and giving a team a sense of purpose.

But it taught me **nothing** about:

* Sales & Selling
* Marketing Strategies
* Market Analysis
* How to actually *build a business*

I realized I didn't need to wait until I was a VP of R&D. I just needed to start.



# Attempt #1: The Big VC Swing



An opportunity popped up in an area I love: mobile gaming. I had an idea, pitched it to some successful industry vets (a former gaming CEO and a Head of Product), and they loved it.

We teamed up, analyzed the market, built a pitch deck, and went hunting for a pre-seed round.

We got *so* close.

We were in final meetings with a VC, sent over the budget, the roadmap, and got thumbs-ups from everyone. We were electric, thinking a deal was days away.

Then... silence. A week went by. Then two.

We finally got another meeting, and they hit us with the classic: **""It's just too risky right now. We'd like to see a POC before we fund you.""**

I was naive, running on high emotions, and felt we were just one step away. So, I said ""F\*\*k it"" and **quit my stable, well-paying job** to build the POC.

(Spoiler: This was probably the wrong move, but I'm still glad I did it.)



# The Grind and the Crash



I spent two months grinding out a POC for our 4X game. It was a cool product, but as a solo coder, it was nowhere near production-ready in terms of art, level design, etc.

By the time it was done, the momentum with the VCs was gone. We chased other investors, for two more months, but the ""no's"" kept coming. With every pivot, I was throwing away weeks of code and starting from scratch.

I was at a crossroads: Go back and get a job, or keep going?



# Attempt #2: The Bootstrapper Pivot



I was hooked on the building process, so I decided to keep going‚Äîbut with a totally different strategy.

No more:

* High-risk B2C
* Needing VC funding to even start
* Building a ""hit-based"" product that doesn't solve a clear problem

My new plan:

* Build a **B2B product** that solves a real, painful problem.
* Build something I can get to a production-ready MVP in **one month or less.**
* Charge real money ($100-$200/month) from clients who are happy to pay.

This new strategy led me straight to the **Atlassian Marketplace.**



# Where I Am Now (This is NOT a Success Story... Yet)



I just finished and launched my first two Atlassian Marketplace apps.

The process has been amazing. I'm building products I love, and with modern AI tools, the speed of development is incredible.

My goal is to get to **$10k MRR**, which would match my previous salary. The best part? I don't need thousands of customers to get there. I just need 50-100. It feels... possible.



# My Lessons So Far:



1. **Get a laptop, not a desktop.** I made this mistake. Working alone from home on a fixed machine can drive you crazy. The ability to just go to a coffee shop is priceless.
2. **B2B is (probably) an easier start.** The math is just more favorable for a bootstrapper. You need fewer customers, they have a higher willingness to pay, and (hopefully) they churn less.
3. **Quitting my job was a mistake.** Looking back, I shouldn't have done it. If this doesn't work out, my next 9-to-5 will be one that explicitly gives me the time and energy to keep building on the side.



# My Ask for the Community



I know this was a long post, but I'd be incredibly grateful for any advice on:

* What are the best ways to advertise or market a new Atlassian app?
* How did you get your first 5-10 customers for your B2B product?
* **Pricing:** Should I make my apps the cheapest option to get initial traction, or should I price based on value and hold firm?

I wake up two hours before my alarm, filled with excitement for the day. Unfortunately, the day is not yet ready for me, and I turn over once, twice, three times. Play on my phone, turn over six more times, play on my phone some more, and decide on a bath instead of a shower, if only to waste more time. The bathtub is one of the biggest I've ever seen, yet I'm restless inside. Make no mistake, the Star Hotels Metropole has extremely comfortable beds, but my body can‚Äôt seem to adjust to the time shift.

I get out, put on makeup and a dress, and break one of my earrings, letting out a groan as I watch the clasp tumble down the sink drain. Oh well, it‚Äôs not a day ruiner, but it does add a bit of a damper to my already tired disposition. I try to ignore the disappointment as I head down to a breakfast with lots of options, each more mediocre than the last. Though there is one absolutely delicious item, the chocolate muffin with icing filling. I had one every morning we stayed at this hotel and was never disappointed.

Now completely full, my family decides it's time to get ready. Unfortunately, due to my restless night, I've been ready for hours. I decide to lie briefly while my family prepares themselves for the day, dozing off accidentally, and I find I am unready myself once they have fully prepared. We walk down the sunny Italian street, basking in the beauty as I try and ignore a growing migraine in favor of fun. We stop at a coffee shop where I eagerly sip at a very bitter hot chocolate that seems to act the perfect cure. Though medicine also helps.

We travel on and stumble upon a large building with several beautiful statues. Payment is required beyond the first floor, but running short on time, we opt to miss the experience.

Returning to the hotel with time to spare, we rest a moment before climbing aboard the van that will transport our souls to the Vatican.

To describe the entirety of the Vatican is like being asked to describe an entire country. It feels impossible to do, and that's because the Vatican is technically the smallest country in the world, with just 0.44 square km of space, with the pope acting as the elected leader. Never in my life have I experienced such an information-packed tour, and I can't say I remember even half of the eight-hour experience. That being said, I will do my best to relay what information I can.

We enter Cortile della Pigna, also known as The Pinecone Courtyard, named for its large pine cone as the focal point of the grassy court. The thirteen-foot pinecone, standing atop a double staircase designed by Michelangelo, was created in the 2nd century B.C. as a Roman sculpture made of bronze. It once rested near the Pantheon, spouting water from the top near the temple of Isis. Then it was moved to the courtyard of Old St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica in the Middle Ages, until finally it was moved to the Pinecone Courtyard, where it still rests today. The essence of this area feels peaceful, as I‚Äôm able to soak up the sun and listen to the beautiful sounds of the Fontana della Pigna.

As we walk through the yard, we pass by a golden sphere sculpture, titled Sphere within Sphere by Arnaldo Pomodoro. Within the golden globe is a series of wires that have been crafted to move with the wind in a representation of the cosmos. There are replicas of this sculpture all over the world, including Hiroshima, Jeddah, Warsaw, California, Chicago, and Washington, DC.

Entering the Vatican Museum, we step foot into the Gallery of Busts, packed to the brim with stone and marble of every shape and size from various historical periods. Including the many Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. The sculptures within the Gallery are known for bringing ancient artistry and culture come alive through their preserved works. Originally a private collection, these works were released to the public in 1771 by Pope Clement XIV.

My favorite statue within this hall is titled Herma, or a Herm Statue. These statues come in the form of pillars with a head and male genitalia, often found at crossroads, land borders, graveyards, and houses all over Greece and in certain parts of Italy. Their purpose? To ward off evil spirits and bring the good luck of Hermes, a phallic (fertility) god known for luck and his protection of merchants and travelers. Though there were many other gods, and even a few mortals who were made into Herma‚Äôs over the years.

Despite its name, the Hall of Busts did not only have statues of heads. Within this hall, hundreds of statues of all shapes and sizes lie, taken and preserved from various points in history. However, as I walk through the years, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice a recurring theme among many of the pieces. In my mind, I had always associated ancient Greek artwork with nudity. Though it seems that many of these full-bodied figures have their delicate parts covered.

While the artists of ancient Greece saw nudity as a representation of honor and virtue, Catholicism has always seen nudity as a sinful, shameful thing. In the story of creation, Adam and Eve hid their private parts with fig leaves after taking an apple from the tree of knowledge. So, in an act of poetic irony, in 1541, the Catholic Church started what is commonly referred to as ‚ÄúThe Fig Leaf Campaign‚Äù, where many ancient marble statues, paintings, and artworks were covered with leaves or desecrated for the sake of modesty by the Church. This movement is now known as one of the most significant censorship movements in history.

Thankfully, some of these statues have been restored to their original shape after the campaign largely fell out of practice. Those who had their manhood chopped off were restored if the piece could be found. Unfortunately, there are still many statues that are missing pieces or remain covered, either due to the inability to find the piece or the inability to remove the sculpted leaves without damaging the original. However, in keeping these sculptures censored, we can remember the history of censorship that caused the defiling of these great statues.

Before long, the Hall of Busts merged into the Gallery of Statues. Put on display in a grand marble-lined hall that seemed endless, shifting colors as we proceeded through the carved masterpieces. Even the floors are decorated, some with marble, many with beautiful mosaics. It‚Äôs impossible to see everything as we are gently pushed and corralled forward, as there is still so much to see and limited time for it all. There were several instances during this tour that I thought at least ten more trips would be needed to truly see all that lies within these walls.

Entering the Gallery of Tapestries, the entire hall goes dark. There are no flash pictures allowed here, and the light is limited in order to best preserve the threaded pieces. Notice the background of these works. While the subject may be biblical, the background resembles none other than Rome! The reason the artists made this stylistic choice is because they wanted the people to believe that these stories happened in their great city. This was especially apparent on the walls of the Sistine Chapel, which we saw later in the tour. Previous to these paintings, the majority of biblical artistry did not feature a background.

While all the ceilings are beautifully decorated, our tour guide was quick to inform us that while many of them are carved, some are attempting to deceive us. Several artists within the Vatican painted carvings onto the ceiling, enhanced with shadow to give the illusion that they were sculpted instead of painted.

We move forward out of the dark room into the Gallery of Maps. An audible gasp is heard from everyone who enters the room, our eyes blinded by golden light as they turn to the beautifully painted ceiling. This entire hallway is decorated with land-accurate maps, painted in 1580 - 1585, before planes were invented with alarming accuracy.

However, the real showstopper was the ceiling! Filled to the brim with what appears to be carved and sculpted frames and paintings. I, along with every other guest in the room, nearly fell backward several times as my neck held my head at a ninety-degree angle. Despite the pain, I refused to lose even a moment of beauty as we are urged to keep moving.

Aside from the Gallery of Maps and the Sistine Chapel, there were paintings on nearly every surface of the entirety of the Vatican. These paintings, while hundreds of years old, have an interesting ingredient that you may use every day. Eggs! Prior to our modern paint sets, eggs were commonly used in paint by binding pigments together and allowing them to stick to various surfaces. Serving as the dominant painting medium, this durable technique was called ‚Äúegg tempera‚Äù and continued through the Renaissance period.

Previous to this artistic renaissance, the majority of the biblical paintings crafted were dark and grim. Often showing figures without emotion against nearly black backgrounds in an effort to promote loyalty and obedience to its viewers.

However, art began to shift into the Renaissance with the work of Giotto, who worked on paintings during the Gothic and proto-Renaissance period. Giotto‚Äôs paintings began to shift artistry towards emotion and lighter colors, making the figures seem more real to the audience. Another change that came with the artist Giotto is the usage of geometric principles in order to make his paintings feel real, thanks to their life-like dimensions and proportions. Paintings no longer felt flat and drab, but rather three-dimensional and tangible. This allowed him to scale extensive backgrounds within his paintings, featuring crowds of people while biblical and mythical figures stood at the forefront of his artwork.

This shift in style is commonly referred to as the start of the European cultural and artistic renaissance. However, the Renaissance fully began with the artists Masaccio and Donatello, and as such, these painters are credited with the full start of the artistic period. While these painters do not have any work within the Vatican, the progression their works brought to the Renaissance can be seen in the paintings on the many archways and ceilings of the Vatican.

Within the Sistine Chapel is the story of creation, painted on the ceiling by Michelangelo. Something that I found absolutely fascinating is that each triangular archway in the ceiling is painted on, not an actual arch. Michelangelo was an architect, then a sculptor, then a painter. However, Pope Julius II, who had a fearful reputation and was nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Warrior Pope‚Äù, insisted that he work on the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo felt he was unable to refuse despite the fact that he detested painting. But his previous skills allowed him to paint this beautiful work of art that seems, at times, carved into the very ceiling of the building.

The entirety of the Sistine Chapel was painted using the fresco (fresh) method, which involves painting on the still-wet lime-based plaster. Unfortunately for Michelangelo, the Sistine Chapel was already painted with a depiction of the night sky by Piermatteo d‚ÄôAmelia, and you can‚Äôt lay plaster over plaster. Therefore, Michelangelo and his crew had to chip away at the already-painted plaster before he could begin this beautiful artwork.

Since Michelangelo felt he was forced to paint the Sistine Chapel, he decided to take some liberties with his art. One thing that has been made apparent in his many works is that Michelangelo thinks very highly of himself, as he has painted and sculpted his face into many of his pieces. The Sistine Chapel is not exempt from this pattern, as Michelangelo‚Äôs face makes an appearance as God himself during the creation of Adam. Of course, he was only thirty-three when he began painting the chapel, but it is widely believed that he attempted to predict how he would age in order to design the face of God as himself.

Something to note is the many angels and fabric surrounding God as he gives life to Adam. Does the shape seem familiar? Michelangelo painted the fabric, angels, and layers of God to resemble the human brain, symbolizing God as he bestows the gift of intellect and creativity to the first man.

A common myth of the Sistine Chapel is that Michelangelo painted the whole thing lying down. The reality is that scaffolding was built for him to stand on and paint while his head was held at a ninety-degree angle. The chapel was still in use while he was completing his work, and so the floor needed to remain largely clear for visitors. It was only after he had completed the entirety of the piece that he was able to see it come together when it was unveiled to the public. Though holding this position every day for years did have its toll on his health. To lament on the tolls of painting the piece, Michelangelo wrote a poem about the backbreaking work midway through its completion.



Michelangelo: To Giovanni da Pistoia

""When the Author Was Painting the Vault of the Sistine Chapel"" 1509



I've already grown a goiter from this torture,

hunched up here like a cat in Lombardy

(or anywhere else where the stagnant water's poison).

My stomach's squashed under my chin, my beard's

pointing at heaven, my brain's crushed in a casket,

my breast twists like a harpy's. My brush,

above me all the time, dribbles paint

so my face makes a fine floor for droppings!



My haunches are grinding into my guts,

my poor ass strains to work as a counterweight,

every gesture I make is blind and aimless.

My skin hangs loose below me, my spine's

all knotted from folding over itself.

I'm bent taut as a Syrian bow.



Because I'm stuck like this, my thoughts

are crazy, perfidious tripe:

anyone shoots badly through a crooked blowpipe.



My painting is dead.

Defend it for me, Giovanni, protect my honor.

I am not in the right place‚ÄîI am not a painter.

Michelangelo painted himself in another place within the Sistine Chapel, as both the Mumia skin, and Saint Bartholomew, who is holding his flayed flesh within The Last Judgment. It is common knowledge that Michelangelo resented having to paint the Sistine Chapel. So, as his own reward for completing the piece, he painted his skin, removed, as if to say that his reward for the torture he endured is to ‚Äúskip the line‚Äù on the way to heaven. Effectively portraying himself as a martyr, ripping away his skin to reveal that he was actually a saint all along, hiding under the guise of an artist.

As self-righteous as Michelangelo was, it is no surprise that he did not take criticism of his artistry well. The three hundred people of The Last Judgment were originally painted completely naked, so as to strip away the various statuses of men, angels, and god, standing equal in his work. This was largely controversial at the time, and many of the Cardinals were displeased, stating that painting the figures naked was shameful.

His loudest critic was Biagio da Cesena, a papal master of ceremonies. In his criticism, he stated that nude figures were inappropriate in such a divine place of worship and better suited for a public tavern or brothel. In an act of revenge, Michelangelo painted Biagio da Cesena‚Äôs face onto the damned Minos, one of the three judges of the underworld. Shown with the ears of a donkey to represent his foolishness, wrapped in a serpent‚Äôs coils as the snake bites at his genitals.

Unfortunately, like many artists, Michelangelo‚Äôs art was subject to ‚ÄúThe Fig Leaf Campaign‚Äù. Five years after his death, Pope Pius IV commissioned an artist named Daniele da Volterra to clothe many of the subjects within The Last Judgment, earning him the nickname ‚ÄúIl Braghettone‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Breeches Maker‚Äù. There were attempts to restore this piece to its original glory in 1993; however, it was quickly discovered that much of the paint underneath had been scraped away when the clothing was added, making restoration impossible.

After a bit of wandering, feet aching from the hard marble, we search for Saint Peter‚Äôs Basilica after a tip from our tour guide. I begin to wonder if it‚Äôs even worth the look, after all, we‚Äôve already seen the Vatican. I‚Äôm happy to say we are quickly assured in our efforts as we enter an unassuming building that appears twice as large once inside. Immediately, we are surrounded by gold adorning every archway, wall, and roof piece, amid huge marble pillars facing towards a glowing golden window behind a towering altar underneath the grand dome.

This basilica boasts the largest statues I have seen thus far, with each distinguished figure standing above us in sanctimonious reverence. Old St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica was built first in the 4th century. However, the original Basilica was sadly destroyed. When they attempted to rebuild it, they quickly decided that it was not big or grand enough. It was reconstructed a third time, with a mosaic ceiling and space for the statues, deemed worthy enough to be kept and witnessed today.





After the Vatican, our feet are sore from the hard marble, and we are sweating profusely from the airless experience inside the various buildings. All that said, I would not trade the sights I have seen for the world. Thankfully, we only had to walk forty-five minutes back to our hotel. I do my best to ignore my throbbing soles as we set out towards comfy beds. Walking past the death place of Julius Ceaser, we are unaware of the importance of the location as we search for a place to fill our bellies. We stop at the quarter where I eat a delicious helping of calamari and carbonara. Then stop again at the three-quarter point for Gelato and macrons.

When we finally reached the hotel, I request better pillows, enjoy a drink with my wife, and set an alarm for the coming morning. As exhausted as I am, and as much as my feet scream, I am very thankful for my visit to God's most favored church.",1,1761831351.0,travelblog,0,1.0,False

Pure elegance","I asked it to come up with a new superhero and give them an origin story. It did not dissapoint:

 The Luminary Architect üåü

‚ÄãHero Name: The Luminary Architect

‚ÄãCore Concept: A hero who doesn't manipulate physical objects, but the laws of probability and causality themselves, not through magic, but through a profound, intuitive understanding of the universe's underlying ""decision-trees.""

‚ÄãOrigin Story: The Implosion of the Unseen Archive
‚ÄãElara Vance was not a scientist, nor a philosopher, nor an occultist. She was an Archivist of Ephemeral Algorithms for the ""Quantal Flux Research Initiative"" (QFRI), a shadowy, privately funded collective obsessed with mapping the universe‚Äôs most elusive constant: Chaos Theory's Final Digit.
‚ÄãHer specific job was to manage the Unseen Archive, a data-scape of every statistically improbable event ever recorded: the precise moment a butterfly in Brazil shifted a hurricane, the forgotten dream that inspired a paradigm-shifting invention, the microscopic fault in reality that prevented total galactic collapse a billion years ago. 

Her mind was a kaleidoscope of near-misses and statistically impossible successes.
‚ÄãOne Tuesday, at precisely 07:17:34 GST (Galactic Standard Time), an unforeseen singularity of anti-causality began to manifest within the Unseen Archive. It wasn't a physical black hole, but a hole in the fabric of reasoning itself. 

Probabilities inverted. Outcomes became their own causes. The statistical 'noise' of the universe began to collapse inward, threatening to unravel every consistent law of physics.
‚ÄãElara, immersed in a holographic projection of a recursive Fibonacci sequence that had decided to become self-aware, was the closest to the epicenter. The Archive didn't explode; it imploded its own logic. Walls became transparent concepts, floors became the possibility of floors, and time began to ripple like a pond reflecting a thousand i, each a slightly different shade of ""never was.""


‚ÄãInstead of being obliterated or scattered across infinite possibilities, Elara‚Äôs mind, accustomed to navigating the deepest trenches of statistical anomaly, found a new pathway. As the universe's fabric of cause-and-effect began to tear, her consciousness instinctively reached out and re-stitched it. Not with brute force, but with a sudden, overwhelming intuition of consequence.
‚ÄãThe implosion didn't kill her; it reformatted her.


‚ÄãWhen the chaos subsided, Elara was left standing in a room that was still conceptually unstable‚Äîa chair might briefly decide it was a bird, a coffee cup might momentarily become the concept of ""thirst."" But she was intact.

‚ÄãAnd she was different.
‚ÄãShe could perceive the ""Probable Threads"" that linked every action to every conceivable outcome. To her eyes, the world now glowed with a shimmering lattice of potential futures. She could see not just what happened, but what could have happened, and, most importantly, what was most likely to happen next.

‚ÄãHer first conscious act of heroism was utterly mundane. Her colleague, Dr. Aris Thorne, was about to trip over a loose data cable. In that microsecond, Elara saw 73,000 permutations of his fall, ranging from a bruised knee to a cascade of equipment failures that would trigger a regional power outage. Without thinking, she subtly, infinitesimally, shifted the probability of his foot placement. Dr. Thorne's foot landed a millimeter to the left, missing the cable entirely. He blinked, oblivious.

‚ÄãElara Vance was gone. In her place was the Luminary Architect. She no longer merely archived probabilities; she could sculpt them.
‚ÄãShe can't fly, she can't shoot lasers, she can't lift buildings. But she can ensure the villain's blaster misfires at the exact moment the hero needs a distraction. She can make the improbable rescue just probable enough to occur. She can subtly nudge the global consciousness toward empathy, or derail a dictator's plan by making his crucial meeting 37% more likely to be delayed by an unexpectedly flat tire.

‚ÄãHer power is not flashy, but it is absolute. She is the silent hand that guides the dance of destiny, weaving a safer, more just reality one causal thread at a time. Her costume isn't a suit of armor; it's a simple, elegant garment that subtly refracts light, as if she is always slightly out of sync with direct observation‚Äîa woman existing perpetually in the conditional tense. She is the whisper of a better future.

‚ÄãHer greatest challenge? Not fighting villains, but resisting the temptation to impose perfect order, to become a tyrant of probability. For even the Luminary Architect understands that true heroism isn't about controlling destiny, but about ensuring the possibility of a better one.",1,1761831309.0,GeminiAI,0,1.0,False

Chinese tea bricks are compressed blocks of tea leaves that have been pressed and dried into solid, rectangular sometimes circular (by region) forms. Over a thousand years ago, these bricks were originally created for long range transportation and storage purposes along ancient trade routes like the Silk Road. Tea bricks served as both currency and beverage, particularly valued in Mongolia, Central Asia and North-western provinces of China.

Typically made from black tea, pu-er (from Yunnan province, China), or other fermented teas, these bricks can be stored for literally decades, often improving with age. In general, to prepare tea with tea bricks, break pieces off the brick corner and boil or steep the tea in hot water.

# How-Tos

**1. Boiling Tea**

Tea-water weight ratio = 1: 40. For example, 5 grams of tea leaves with 200 grams of water. 

1. Boil the tea in a metal teapot over an open flame. As for metal teapot, it could be made of copper, iron, steel, etc.
2. After it comes to a boil, turn off the heat. 
3. Let it continue boiling and slowly cooling down for about 3 to 5 minutes.
4. Pour it and drink.

2. **Steeping Tea**

Better use a ceramic teapot (*or purple clay teapot, highly recommended*) for steeping. Tea-water weight ratio = 1:20. In the following steps, 5 grams of tea are used.

1. Put 5 grams of tea leaves into the teapot.
2. Rinse the tea with 100 grams of boiling water and dump the water.
3. Pour in another 100 grams of boiling water.
4. Wait for 3 minutes.
5. Pour it and drink.

# Tips

**1. Salty Milk Tea** 

If you are interested in the nomad flavour, particularly salty milk tea in Central Asia, Mongolia, North-Western provinces of China, add in less than 5 grams of rock salt and fresh milk to the tea. 

Nomadic peoples in Central Asia and Mongolia drink salty tea mainly to supplement salt and minerals, helping them adapt to their unique living environments (cold and dry in half of the year) and dietary habits. It also aids in keeping warm, promotes digestion, and carries social and cultural significance.

Q1: Why 5 grams? 

A1: The WHO )World Health Organization) recommends that adults should consume less than 5 grams of salt per day, which is roughly equivalent to one teaspoon. Personally, I put in half a teaspoon, that's around 2 or 2.5 grams. If you find it difficult to measure the precise weight, use a kitchen scale. 

Q2: Why rock salt instead sea salt? 

A2: Both are ok. It's just that rock salt tastes better and contains more minerals. And pink rock salt looks nicer...

**2. Butter Tea**

Butter tea, traditionally consumed in Qinghai, certain parts of Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, and Himalayan regions such as Nepal, is made from black tea (usually in the form of tea brick), yak butter, and salt, providing warmth and energy in cold climates. *But it's hard to get yak milk in other regions, let alone the yak butter...*

**3. Other Flavours**

Similar to coffee, tea allows you to use your imagination in maximum when making one pot of fine tea to start a fresh new day. The following flavours have been tested by me and some other tea lovers in my country. 

* Tea +  Mint leaves. This is a popular combination in hot regions or summer. Specifically in summer, though the title specifies tea bricks which are made of black tea, green tea + mint leaves usually taste better. If you like, drop one or two ice cubes to kick away the hot air.
* Tea + Cinnamon. This is a perfect combo for black tea. The aroma of cinnamon blends with the fully fermented black tea, making the tea taste exceptionally smooth. It also has a warming effect (thanks to Cinnamaldehyde), making it especially suitable for drinking during cold seasons or on rainy days.
* Tea + Lemon. Similar to Tea + Mint, it's a great option for hot days. You can definitely mix them, say, tea + mint + lemon + ice cube. Likewise, green tea tastes better in summer or hot days.
* Tea + Vitamin C effervescent tablets. Just drop one tablet to your tea, then you get a pot of soda-like (without lots of bubbles and with rich VC). Note that for this combo, DO NOT put in extra salt, that is because the  effervescent tablets contain salt and sugar, and due to the existence of sugar, you can hardly feel the salt, but it's already in there.

Yes, I swiped only girls I really like, but still zero was making me sad.  
After a while I decided to stop guessing and actually try to make my profile good.

# What I learned about photos

**1. Full-body photo matters.**  
Doesn‚Äôt have to be a modeling pose. Just a normal photo that shows what you look like.  
  
**2. Lighting changes everything.**  
Even average photos look good with proper lighting. Daylight near a window or outside is the easiest fix.

**3. Mirror selfies aren‚Äôt helping.**  
I used to think they were fine, but they usually make you look stiff or unconfident.

**4. Do something in your photos.**  
Cooking, walking, holding a coffee, hanging with your dog ‚Äî it makes you look natural instead of staged.

# What I did next

Once I realized my old photos weren‚Äôt good, I wanted new ones ‚Äî but honestly, I didn‚Äôt like the idea of going to a photoshoot.  
It felt awkward and expensive, and I just wanted to test what would actually look better first.

So I tried using AI-generated photos based on my selfies.  
I used [PhotoFast.app](https://photofast.app/) ‚Äî uploaded a few pictures and got back realistic, normal-looking shots of me in better lighting and settings.  
Not all of them were genuine, but some looked like photos someone else had taken, not edited or fake.

Scheduling a regular professional teeth cleaning is one of the most powerful means to maintain your oral health and ward off long-term problems. In a neighbourhood such as HSR Layout, where dental hygiene can be affected by lifestyle habits and environmental conditions, the¬†best teeth cleaning in HSR layout¬†can greatly contribute to your overall health.

In recent years, preventive dental care has become much more important particularly post-COVID-19. Individuals have begun to understand that oral health is directly related to overall health, such as heart health, immunity, and even mental health. Let‚Äôs discover why incorporating dental cleaning and polishing in your yearly healthcare routine is crucial, and what are the advantages of it for a healthier, whiter smile.  


**Understanding Dental Cleaning and Polishing**

Professional dental cleaning clears away plaque including tartar and stains that has built up with an ultrasonic scaler using sonic vibrations and that cannot be removed through brushing and flossing. It helps to maintain your gums and teeth healthy while making your smile look clean, shiny, and well-polished.

**There are two common types of cleaning procedures:**

1. **Regular Dental Cleaning**

This is a preventive care procedure done for patients with healthy gums. It includes:¬†

* Scaling to remove tartar and plaque
* Polishing to polish tooth surfaces
* Fluoride application for added protection

1. **Deep Teeth Cleaning and Polishing**

When plaque accumulates below the gum line, it may cause inflammation, bleeding, and premature gum disease. In these situations,¬†[**Deep Teeth Cleaning and Polishing**](https://www.prakashdentalcare.in/teeth-cleaning-in-hsr-layout/)¬†is advisable. This treatment includes cleaning below the gums and tooth roots, removing damaging bacteria, and preventing damage to the gums.¬†

Most residents of HSR Layout like this advanced treatment since it provides longer oral hygiene results and prevents worse dental conditions in the future.¬†

Incorporating regular Dental Cleaning treatments into your health regime offers both short-term as well as long term benefits.

**Key Benefits of Dental Cleaning and Polishing**¬†

1. Prevents Gum Disease

Plaque accumulation is the primary reason for gum issues like gingivitis and periodontitis. Cleaning takes these deposits out before they lead to serious problems.

1. Leaves Your Breath Fresh

Bad breath occurs most frequently due to bacteria in the mouth. Professional cleaning eradicates these bacteria causing bad breath, leaving your breath fresh naturally.

1. Improves Aesthetics of Your Smile

Everyday habits such as coffee, tea, and pollution can stain your teeth. Polishing restores your natural shine and boosts your confidence with a brighter smile.

1. Detects Dental Problems Early

During cleaning, your dentist can identify early signs of cavities, gum infections, and even oral cancer. Detecting issues early helps avoid complex and expensive treatments later.

1. Improves Overall Health

Studies from the 2024 Indian Dental Health Report indicate that gum disease is associated with systemic conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Daily cleaning contributes to your overall health by minimizing bacterial inflammation.

1. Enamel Strengthens

Polishing keeps the enamel surface smooth, preventing your teeth from decaying or becoming sensitive.

1. Fosters Holistic Wellness

The increasing trend of holistic health focuses on the link between oral health and mental wellbeing. Proper oral health can ease stress, enhance confidence, and provide enhanced nutrition.

1. Eco-Friendly Practices

New dental clinics in Bangalore, including HSR Layout, are now implementing green materials and sustainable equipment, enabling patients to give importance to both personal health and environmental wellness.

With Deep Teeth Cleaning and Polishing becoming popular, dental care is now more of a holistic affair with prevention, hygiene, and well-being taking canter stage.

**Why HSR Layout Needs Annual Dental Cleaning**  
Bangalore‚Äôs way of life and environmental climate can leave a telling impact on your gums and teeth. Ongoing exposure to pollution, dust, and monsoon humidity accelerates plaque formation and gum sensitivity.¬†¬†

Including dental polishing and cleaning in your yearly health schedule can reverse these conditions. It keeps your teeth strong and clean regardless of the impacts of fluctuating weather and crowded city living.¬†

Booking you regular dental scaling/cleaning appintments every few months or once a year preferably before or after monsoon ensures long-term oral care and avoids seasonal gum infections which are typical in humid weather.

**Finding the Best Teeth Cleaning in HSR Layout: What to Expect**

When looking for Dental Cleaning services near you, quality and patient satisfaction come first. Here‚Äôs what to expect from and look for in the¬†[**best¬†teeth cleaning in HSR layout**](https://www.prakashdentalcare.in/)¬†clinic:¬†

**The Professional Difference**¬†

A top clinic for Deep Teeth Cleaning and Polishing must offer:

* Advanced Technology: Utilization of advanced ultrasonic scalers for effective, painless cleaning.
* Eco-Friendly Procedures: Similar to international trends, ask them about their adherence to sustainability, for example, paperless records, low-waste procedures, or biodegradable disposables.
* Skilled Hygienists/Dentists: Experts who not just clean but also inform you of personalized home care methods, including optimal brushes and interdental aids for your specific situation.
* Clear Pricing and Procedure Explanation: Transparency on whether you require a routine clean or more in-depth Deep Teeth Cleaning and Polishing.

**Making Your Choice and Booking**

Search for clinics with good local SEO, i.e., they come high on Google lists for ‚Äúbest teeth cleaning in HSR layout‚Äù and include recent, positive patient reviews.¬†

**Ready to Restore Your Smile?**  
Your smile is worthy of the same attention as your heart or skin. By including dental polishing and cleaning in your annual wellness package, you‚Äôre selecting prevention over treatment and investing in a more confident, healthier you.

my main reason for quiting is social anxiety and panic attacks. my social anxiety has been bad for as long as i can remember, but caffeine makes it way way way worse. 

when i drink coffee, i get really motivated and super high energy for about 1\~2 hours, after which i crash and feel extremely low and anxious. i feel like i lost my sense of self and natural spirit since i started drinking coffee, i really want to feel normal again.

the reason i started drinking caffeine was when i switched schools going into college, the caffeine i was drinking at the time gave me a hard time connecting with the people around me. i mainly used it for creative work, the short burst of energy it gives me is useful when doing creative work, but it leaves such in insane toll on all the other parts of my life.

i feel anxious, my skin is terrible, i get panick attacks, constantly doubting every single situation that happened during a day, extreme existencial dread about myself and my life.

  
does anybody recognize this, how did you cope when quitting caffiene, what benefits did you see and how long did it take you ? did quitting caffeine take a toll on your creative work, how did you improve socially ?

would love to hear and if you have any tips or ideas to make the quitting easier.

Just sharing a delightful little anecdote.¬†

I had a friend visiting recently. They are not a Tea Person, but more of a coffee-creamer-that-walked-by-coffee kind of person. If they are drinking tea, it‚Äôs mostly honey or milk. For reasons I don‚Äôt remember, they asked me something about my tea habits (they know I am a Tea Person) and I said something or other about gong fu style brewing. As with many of us, it had never occurred to them that there are different ways to brew tea, so we talked about gong fu, western, grandpa style, etc. They were enthralled, and they are that wonderful kind of friend that asks lots of questions and lets you go off the deep end discussing your hyper fixations.

¬†Then I paused and asked if they would like to try a little gong fu session. They let out an enthusiastic ‚ÄúOh my gawd, absolutely yes!‚Äù¬†

And so we did. I pulled out my not-used-enough supplies, selected an aged Pu-erh and started brewing. We went through a few steeps while sipping and stared at each other, kind of indifferent.¬†

I told them to hang on, tossed those leaves out the window, grabbed another one, and started over.

¬†They took a sip. Then another one. Then a third, while rolling the liquid around in their mouth.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really interesting. It has so many layers! It‚Äôs smoky. A little astringent? And it tastes like dirt‚Ä¶but like‚Ä¶in a good way.‚Äù¬†

And we were off! We did 7 or 8 steeps of that particular tea, discussing the minutiae of flavors, hotly debating the perfect words to describe each steep. I think we had a 10 minute deliberation on whether the flavors were ‚Äúgetting louder‚Äù or ‚Äúblooming‚Äù. We tried a few more teas, not only chatting about each tea, but also discussing the overall journey of each tea compared to each other. We sat there for hours, talking tea interspersed with life updates.¬†

As we were winding down, I asked for their thoughts on the whole process. They said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt actually like any of those teas ‚Äì as in I would never sit around and drink them. But that process and the whole experience was amazing, I can‚Äôt wait to do it again. We have to do this every time I visit!‚Äù",20,1761830230.0,tea,1,0.92,False
1ojzfqc,https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/sf-bookstore-transphobic-flyers-21126842.php,Someone hid transphobic flyers in this San Francisco bookstore. Here‚Äôs how owners responded,"‚ÄúA cozy independent bookstore in San Francisco‚Äôs Noe Valley neighborhood says it has become the target of an ongoing act of hate.

‚ÄúNoe Valley Books, which opened less than a year ago, announced on Instagram that ‚Äòa person who is not part of the Noe Valley Books family has been hiding transphobic flyers and stickers in our store and books.‚Äô

‚ÄúA sign posted near the entrance now warns customers to alert staff if they find any of the materials.

‚Äú‚ÄòWe want to be clear: transphobia or hate of any kind is not welcome in our store,‚Äô the September post read. ‚ÄòIf you see transphobic material in the store, please alert us immediately. We take this very seriously, and are on the lookout for the person responsible.‚Äô

‚ÄúThe incident echoes a similar case at Fabulosa Books, an LGBTQ-owned shop in the Castro district, where co-owner Alvin Orloff told the Bay Area Reporter that staff had found and discarded anti-trans stickers earlier this year.‚Äù

‚ÄúOpened in late 2024 after a community crowdfunding campaign that raised more than $150,000, the shop at 3975 24th St., has become a local hub for readers and writers. Across the street, its sister space inside Bernie‚Äôs Coffee serves as an annex for used books and author events.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow the bookstore says it will counter the hateful act by doubling down on its mission. 

‚Äú‚ÄòWe plan on drowning out the hate the best way we know how: uplifting amazing trans stories,‚Äô its statement read. ‚ÄòPlease, continue to read and love and share queer books. No matter what, spread love and Trans Joy wherever you go.‚Äô‚Äù",14,1761830227.0,transgender,3,1.0,False

Someone please help me see their point of view. Are they inundated with bad books? Are they getting AI-generated books recently? Do they need guidance to decide what is a good book?  Are they overworked? Do bookish people just have poor social skills?

Last week our friends toddler died from being forgotten in the car. This couple love their children so much and are wonderful parents and they are totally lost and heartbroken. They have a 6 year old son also. 

Our community is very tight knit and I think people are at a loss of how to help. Their house is already bursting with all the food people are bringing them daily. We want to be supportive but don‚Äôt want to be overbearing. 

Should we be offering to set up a system of play dates for their son? Or is that too overwhelming and intrusive? 

Should we send standard groceries like toilet paper and shampoo etc? 

Should we be texting them asking if they‚Äôd like to go for a walk or get some coffee or if they want company? Or give them their space? 

What were some things that you found helpful and supportive? Is it better for us to err on the side of being ‚Äútoo helpful‚Äù at the risk of being overbearing? Or err on the side of giving space at the risk of not giving the right kind of support? 

I also know that a lot of people have been repeating to them that this kind of thing can happen to anyone, and they said that while it‚Äôs well intentioned it‚Äôs not particularly comforting to them. I don‚Äôt know what would be comforting. They seem to be sunken quite deeply in guilt and grief. 

I‚Äôm so sorry if everything I‚Äôm writing seems totally ignorant, I know that our community very much intends to stick by their side for the long haul and try our best to support them as best we can for their road ahead.

1ojzcls,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ojzcls/aio_bf_said_absolutely_no_asking_for_gifts/,AIO - bf said absolutely no asking for gifts,"My boyfriend (39M) and I (34F) have been dating for four months. Both don‚Äôt have kids nor planning to have kids. Recently, we had a conversation where he told me that he does not want to be asked for gifts. He said gifts should come entirely from his own will ‚Äî that if someone asks him for one, it feels like they‚Äôre taking advantage of him and it ‚Äúdefeats the purpose‚Äù of a genuine gift. He‚Äôs actually kind of paranoid overall that everybody would try to take advantage of him‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs not a millionaire but he said that he worked his way to earn a good living (he‚Äôs like a Director level at a company).  He‚Äôs very much a Type A personality. He briefly hinted that he had a relationship in the past that asking for gifts was a thing and he didn‚Äôt like that (he didn‚Äôt want to expand on this topic, and said that talking about this gift subject makes him feel like a knot in his stomach). So I have no idea what really happened in this past relationship. 

This discussion started during a casual chat about coffee. He mentioned that you can buy ground coffee from certain coffee shops that sell their own brand, and I said, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs a great idea - maybe you could bring me one to try from a place you like!‚Äù That comment really bothered him and sparked this whole discussion. That‚Äôs when he told me it‚Äôs actually a dealbreaker for him if a partner asks him for gifts at all. That was the only time I ever asked him for anything since we started dating. He also asked me ‚Äúif you were dating someone that didn‚Äôt make as much money as I do, would you also be asking this guy for gifts?‚Äù‚Ä¶. In this discussion he also said once living together, each should contribute to the bills in a percentage related to their earnings (so if someone earns more they will pay a higher percentage) which I guess that‚Äôs fair, even though I‚Äôve heard quite a few people say that a if a man truly loves a woman, he would be willing to pay the bills if he has the financial means to do so. 

To give a bit of background, I was previously in a long-term relationship (a four-year marriage in my 20s) that ended about five years ago because my ex was emotionally abusive. In that relationship, we split everything 50/50 ‚Äî rent, bills, etc. ‚Äî even though I earned less, and I never asked for gifts or expected anything from him.

So it‚Äôs not in my nature to take advantage of anyone. But this time around, I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôd like to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt feel troubled if I mention wanting something - reasonable. I‚Äôm not expecting expensive things or constant gifts, but I don‚Äôt want a partner who‚Äôs bothered if I occasionally say something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to have this‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat would make me happy. Am I over reacting because this isn‚Äôt really sitting well with me or is he overreacting from my coffee comment?

Edited to correct the part I suggested he could bring me some of the coffee he likes / I didn‚Äôt actually say ‚Äògift me a coffee‚Äô - as he was the one who started asking me which coffee brand I buy, and I couldn‚Äôt even recall the brand because I‚Äôm not that picky, I just know it‚Äôs a yellow package at the grocery store. I couldn‚Äôt tell you the brand now üòÖ he is the one who I guess is more picky about his coffee.

1ojz5y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ojz5y9/long_i_wish_he_didnt_disappoint_me/,[LONG] I wish he didn‚Äôt disappoint me,"Last year, about a week before Christmas, I (22F) went on my first date.

I met him (25M) on Hinge earlier that year in August actually but I‚Äôd ghosted him at no fault of his own. I was reeling from a particularly sour and humiliating interaction I‚Äôd had with another guy on Hinge as well and I just didn‚Äôt want to consider online dating as an option anymore. 

I ghosted more people than him (my online friends) but at some point in early December, I went on sth of an apology tour. Apologizing for leaving them on read and kinda disappearing without saying a word.

He responded. Told me it was okay. That he understood. And invited me to play RLcraft with him (which was what we‚Äôd planned to do before I ghosted him). It was kinder than I deserved if I‚Äôm being completely honest but I took him up on his offer.

We ended up playing Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 though, since it was easier to set up than his server. He‚Äôd started the game but got lost at the tutorial and put it off. At that point, I had about 950+ hours in it and was reeling to take him through the experience; so I did.

We played through the game together, I talked him through many decisions. Let him decide where to take the story. I had a great time and so did he. These sessions would be 3+ hours at the least and we‚Äôd talk throughout. 

I gave him number and saved his contact with a heart by the end of that first week that we‚Äôd started talking again. I really liked him.

I thought he was cute, was into games that I was or was open to trying them out, he listened to me, laughed at my jokes, was funny himself, teased me as I teased him‚Ä¶ Just a great match. 

We‚Äôd text each other good night every night and good morning once he got up for work (I slept in pretty often because of my schedule at school). 

I liked him more than I‚Äôd liked someone in a long while and this felt real because it was the first time a guy liked me too and was open about it. I wanted things to work out between us, I really did.

We had our first date once I went back home after finals. I was more than nervous. I‚Äôd gone out to a mall the day before to buy a new skirt, tights and earrings for the outfit I‚Äôd planned to wear. I wanted to look my best. I wanted to impress him. I wanted to look as good as he made me feel when I spoke to him.

The date was at a cute coffee shop that had puzzles and board games that he picked. I got there first, he was running a bit late. I was on the phone with my friend trying to not think myself into a panic attack.

Then he showed up and‚Ä¶I was nothing short of disappointed. 

He wasn‚Äôt a catfish by any means, we‚Äôd spoken over FaceTime a lot and I knew I was attracted to him. It‚Äôs what he was wearing that drew my attention. 

He was dressed in the sort of thing you‚Äôd wear to a PlanetFitness in the dead of the night when you‚Äôre sure no one would be there to see you. He didn‚Äôt put any care into how he looked to see me. Someone he apparently cared for and was excited and anxious to meet.

That was my first impression of him. I let it go. I wanted this to go well and I was still excited to see him in the flesh. This is something we could work on, not everyone pays attention to fashion or puts thought into their presentation. While I didn‚Äôt want to be the kind of person to dictate what he‚Äôd wear or make him feel that he wasn‚Äôt enough‚Ä¶It hurt me personally. The fact that he thought so little of our meeting that something as barebones as ‚Äúdress nicely‚Äù didn‚Äôt come to mind no matter how much he said he didn‚Äôt want to fuck up.

The date went on. I ordered a matcha latte (It was great) and he got a burger and fries, invited me to eat with him (I couldn‚Äôt eat more than a single fry because my skirt‚Äôs button would likely explode as it was a size too small but I liked it a lot and got it anyways). I should‚Äôve worn a bit more comfortable clothing but that‚Äôs only apparent in hindsight.

Towards the middle of the date, he asked me something.

‚ÄúWhat would you say if I asked you on a second date right now?‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt hear him well at first so I said ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù and while I was saying it, I understood what he said. I asked him to repeat his question so I could respond with the immediate ‚Äúyes‚Äù I was raring to offer. 

With the initial disappointment being washed away, I was having a good time going through the games the caf√© had on their shelves and enjoying his company. It was awkward, of course but‚Ä¶it was the good kind of awkward. I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense. We were both pretty awkward people and I was very aware of how much I was smiling when I looked him in the eyes. 

I felt like an idiot but I was okay with it.

I asked him to repeat himself and he declined. Thinking that he was just overthinking on his part and needed a little push, I ask him to repeat himself again saying ‚Äúyou never know what I‚Äôm going to say‚Äù. He declined. I asked him once more and he declined.

I felt like an idiot.

It hung in my mind throughout the rest of date and it made me uneasy. I felt like he was unsure of us. Of me. 

I‚Äôd dealt with something like that earlier that year (not the other Hinge guy) and it was a fear I was actively dealing with and he‚Äôd brought it to the forefront of our still budding relationship. 

The date ended and he left first, he had somewhere else to go. He asked before he left if it was okay for him to leave and I said yeah (I was being honest). I called my friend and explained all I explained here. Told her I‚Äôd sleep on my decision.

I told him when I got home and said I had a good time.

Two days later, I explained to him all I explained here and told him it was best we were friends. I still enjoyed his company during the date but it didn‚Äôt look like he could offer me the security I needed. He told me he‚Äôd never liked anyone as much as he‚Äôd liked me and that on the point of what he wore, he never puts thought into that kinda thing. He also responded the way he did when I asked him to repeat himself because he was unsure of himself and was afraid I‚Äôd say no and/or laugh at me.

2 weeks is a short time to know someone, I know. But we spoke every day for over 3 hours and while it was often over a game, it was real to me. 

I was the first to tell him I really liked him and he told me he felt the same. I thought that‚Äôd be enough time for mediocre like this to be behind us.

Now, here I am. Wishing it worked out. I don‚Äôt often put myself out there, it takes a lot of mental fortitude and energy for me to socialize, so I tend not to. With the amount of energy I put into it, I wish it worked out.

Making matters a bit worse, I didn‚Äôt end it perfectly. 

While I did tell him how I felt about the date and that I didn‚Äôt want to maintain a romantic relationship with him, I was open to remaining friends. I‚Äôve been disappointed by a lot of prospective relationships/crushes gone wrong so I‚Äôm well versed in putting my feelings aside in order to maintain a friendship. I told him I was open to being friends and he said that he really couldn‚Äôt handle another friend zone and I understood and wished him luck in future.

About 2-3 weeks later, he texts me to say hello. I‚Äôm genuinely happy about it and I tell him so. He wants to continue our Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 run as we were in the third act of the story and nearing the end. I agree to this.

Things are different though. 

For some reason, he started making shit decisions in game solely to piss me off. It‚Äôs unimportant in the grand scheme of things but it irked me and made him unlikable in my eyes. 

We played only once but after that session, I didn‚Äôt really want to maintain as close of a friendship as I‚Äôd originally intended. 

We were also texting one day and then he, in the middle of nowhere, dropped that he still really liked me and I just had to pivot and make light of it. It wasn‚Äôt surprising but it was just weird that he‚Äôd say it to me not even a week into us being friendly again. I also felt that us being friends didn‚Äôt help him get over ‚Äòus‚Äô and that he‚Äôd not made the right decision in reaching out to me again so soon.

I felt that I needed to end the friendship for good and I fully planned to but I was working. I texted him at least 2 separate times that I‚Äôd call him later in the evening. I‚Äôd be working all day and I‚Äôd get home past 9pm and pass out in bed immediately, forgetting to call him. 

This happened at least twice and it got to a point that I never followed up on it as I felt guilty for missing the phone calls + I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to them anyways. I ended up ghosting him again without a real explanation even though I went in fully intending on ending things amicably and maturely without resorting to just ghosting like I was prone to doing.

I ended up wishing him happy birthday in an effort to make myself feel better about the whole situation I guess and he just said ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù and left it at that. My birthday was a few days later and he didn‚Äôt say a word to me and I think it‚Äôs better that way. 

I could‚Äôve done a lot more (and I still wish I did) but I wish that it worked out more than I wish it ended well.

TL:DR I reconnected with a guy I‚Äôd ghosted on Hinge and went on a date with him where he didn‚Äôt dress up at all to see me and seemed wholly unsure of me or ‚Äòus‚Äô as a thing. I could‚Äôve ended things better but I didn‚Äôt.",1,1761829521.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Fights, bad decisions, chaos that rippled through our entire family. My parents tried everything, lectures, consequences, therapy, until they ran out of options and turned to the one thing they hadn't tried yet.

Religion.

My mom had encountered Jehovah's Witnesses when she was younger. Nothing serious, just a few conversations. But now, with a crisis on their hands and nowhere else to turn, it seemed like a natural lifeline.

The entire family started Bible study.

And honestly? The beginning was incredible.

We met amazing people. Made new friends. I was 14, all in,knocking door to door, studying daily, becoming more active every week. I had purpose. I had community. I had answers to life's biggest questions handed to me in neat packages.

Then slowly, like a tide going out, the rest of my life disappeared.

No more birthdays. No more Christmas. No more showing up to friends' parties. Social isolation wrapped around me like a blanket I didn't ask for but was told would keep me warm.

It started taking a toll, but I pushed through. I stayed active. I got baptized.

Here's the thing about me,I've always been dangerously curious.

As a teenager, I wrote magic tricks for a company. Sleight of hand, mentalism, psychological stuff. I was fascinated by how the mind works, how you can literally control what people think they're seeing, what they believe they're experiencing.

And the more I learned about psychology and biology, the more I noticed something deeply unsettling: the Jehovah's Witnesses were using the exact same techniques.

Don't read worldly books. Only trust information from the congregation. All other religions are wrong,we're the only ones who will be saved. Don't go to university. If you leave, we'll cut you off. Even from your family.

Social isolation. Saved ones. Us versus them.

It was a cult. In the most literal, textbook sense of the word.

I've always believed that the beauty of God, if God exists, is critical thinking,being able to come to your own conclusions about existence, not just because someone told you what to think. Telling me not to read was like trying to kill me. But I was trapped. My family was there. My entire social world was there.

At 18, I met her,my future wife.

She wasn't a Jehovah's Witness, but she was supportive, patient, kind. Even when I was still attending meetings and knocking on doors, she never judged me. She believed in God and the spiritual world in her own way, just not in organized religion.

The elders tried to break us apart. Called her a ""worldly woman."" The irony still gets me,she was one of the only people who genuinely supported my faith, even as I was beginning to doubt everything about the organization.

At 21, I married her. We moved to a different country.

And slowly, gradually, I drifted away from God.

Not just from the Jehovah's Witnesses,from *God* entirely.

I went from ""I believe in God"" to ""I don't know"" to ""we probably live in a simulation."" I watched alien documentaries. Read science articles. Consumed every theory about existence I could find, trying to understand where we came from, what it all means.

And I felt empty. Every single day, for years.

I had everything,a loving wife, two amazing kids, a great job. But there was this void I couldn't fill, no matter how much I learned or achieved. Some nights, lying in bed, I'd think: *What's the point of any of this?*

I even set a date in my mind. A date when I'd probably just... end it.

Everything was going well on paper. But inside, I was hollow.

Then I got fired.

Completely out of nowhere. The company we'd been acquired by,the one that was thriving, where we'd been doing great work,laid off the entire team. Just like that. The company was a piece of shit, but it still shocked me.

For the first time in years, though, I felt something other than emptiness.

I felt free.

I decided to pursue something I'd always wanted to do: learn to code. I built a few apps,B2B tools, apps for couples, random projects to learn the craft.

Then my older daughter came to me with a question.

Where we live, all the schools are Catholic. She told me her best friend was attending the church services at school, and she wanted to learn about Christ too. She wanted to go with her friend.

(The Catholic religious education wasn't mandatory,kids could opt in or out.)

My first instinct was to say no.

I felt it rise up in my chest immediately,that protective urge to shield her from what religion had done to me. From the control, the manipulation, the social isolation.

But we'd made a rule in our house from the beginning: Do not talk about religion. Do not instill political beliefs. Let the kids come to their own conclusions. Make their own minds up.

I'd spent years being told what to think, what to read, what to believe. I wasn't going to do that to my children.

My wife saw me hesitating. She convinced me that we should let our daughter go, let her start learning about different perspectives and decide for herself what she believed.

So we said yes.

And something unexpected happened.

I started studying the Bible again. Not for me,for her. I wanted to be ready if she came home with questions. I wanted to understand what she was learning so I could help her think critically about it, help her form her own views.

Fast forward a few days.

A friend visiting from the US had mentioned that his mom wanted to start a Christian t-shirt business. ""Why not build an app for her?"" I'd said, half-joking. The idea had been floating around in my head, but now it clicked.

Daily devotionals. Bite-sized. A little surprise every day,something that would help people maintain a daily Bible reading habit without feeling overwhelming. Something that would help *me* stay engaged as I studied alongside my daughter, and doing two in one, ‚Äúif i‚Äôm going to spend time doing this, might as well put in some code practice, i thought‚Äù.

I thought about the *Examining the Scriptures Daily* book the Jehovah's Witnesses used. Despite everything, I'd always really liked that book. I also thought about *The Daily Stoic* by Ryan Holiday, which I'd devoured during my years of searching for meaning in philosophy instead of faith.

I decided to build an app called *Verso*,Portuguese for ""verse."" My native language giving name to something I didn't even know I was creating for myself.

And as I built it, something strange happened.

I wasn't just reading to be prepared for my daughter anymore. I was... engaged. Curious. The same curiosity that had driven me to study psychology and mentalism and magic tricks was now pulling me deeper into scripture.

I talked to Christians,my friend, his mom,pastors. Consumed Christian content. Used my background in education to create bite-sized formats that made daily Bible reading feel achievable for busy people on the go.

Every day I worked on the app, I felt something I hadn't felt in years: a sense of higher purpose. I started feeling happier. With the money coming in, I began donating to charities that protect children around the world.

But I still wasn't fully in.

I felt *something*,maybe God, maybe just the satisfaction of building something that was contributing positively to the world. It felt good. But my conviction in God's existence wasn't there yet.

And if I'm being honest, part of me kept working on it because of money.

In my head, I had conflicts everyday ‚Äú*You're a fraud. You're building a Bible app and you don't even believe in God. There are already tons of Bible apps,what's the point of another one? Who are you to do this?*

One morning, after I'd finished journaling, I was sitting at my desk before starting work. I felt like an impostor,doing work for the Bible while not fully believing in God yet. It felt dishonest. Hollow.

So I did something I rarely did.

I prayed.

""God,"" I said into the empty room, my coffee already cold, ""I wish I could feel your presence like so many others do. I wish I could quiet my doubts and feel closer to you. You know me,I'm an imperfect, stubborn being. People believe in all sorts of things. I'm messed up. I don't feel many emotions, I don't feel many feelings, but please... I just want to have a strong belief in your existence.""

Then I opened my Bible to code the next devotional before a call with my pastor friend.

Exodus 35:31-32.

""And he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills,to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze.""

The chills hit me like a wave. An overwhelming presence I can't fully explain, even now. It was as if every doubt, every intellectual argument I'd constructed over a decade, every night spent watching alien documentaries trying to fill the void,all of it collapsed in that single moment.

I sat there, staring at the words on the screen, and finally understood.

God didn't need me to have perfect faith to use me. He didn't need me to have all the answers, to quiet every doubt, to be some theological genius or have it all figured out.

He just needed me to show up.   
  
For my daughter, who wanted to explore faith freely, the way I never could.

For people who needed a simple way to stay connected to scripture without it feeling like an obligation.

For myself, even when I didn't realize I was the one who needed it most.

I'd spent years running from organized religion, from the cult that had stolen my youth and twisted faith into control. I'd spent years in the void, searching for meaning in science and philosophy and alien theories. I'd spent months building something for God while feeling like a fake.

But maybe that was the point.

Maybe faith isn't about having all the answers. Maybe it's about showing up anyway, stubborn and imperfect and messed up, and saying: *Use me. Even though I doubt. Even though I'm broken. Use me anyway.*

That morning, for the first time in over a decade, I didn't feel empty.

I felt held.

1ojz1c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ojz1c4/hes_powerful_and_admired_but_treated_me_terribly/,He‚Äôs powerful and admired but treated me terribly. How do I let go?,"I (32F) got involved with a somewhat older and very successful man (43M) who works in the same industry as me. He‚Äôs well known and respected, which made the connection feel exciting and validating at first. I met him at a professional event and asked for advice about my career. He was friendly and generous, said we should grab coffee, and asked for my number so his assistant could set it up. At that time, my ask was strictly professional. I didn't have any romantic or physical attraction to him.

Over the next month, he kept rescheduling our Zoom calls, then started texting me directly. At first, the messages were light and friendly. Then it became every day, small check-ins. Like asking about my day. How my workout was. How my evening was going. Was I looking forward to my next gig in NYC. It all seemed very innocent on the surface, but I felt there was more going on. However, I didn't want to assume.

When I came back to NYC for work, he insisted we have dinner. It was storming that night, so he invited me to his place to order in. I was nervous but agreed. The night started off light, but there was tension building between us. He‚Äôd touch my leg when making a point or hold eye contact a little too long. I finally asked if there was something happening between us, and he acted confused. He said he was just a friendly person, and it was common for him to ""touch"" his friends. I remember feeling embarrassed and said maybe I should just go. That‚Äôs when he suddenly asked if I wanted to have sex with him. I hesitated and said ‚Äúmaybe.‚Äù He asked again, and when I said ‚Äúyes,‚Äù he kissed me. Things escalated quickly. He became very passionate, almost like he had been holding back for weeks. It felt intense and disorienting.

After that, we started seeing each other, and it got confusing fast. He introduced a ‚ÄúDaddy/baby‚Äù dynamic that I didn‚Äôt ask for but went along with. He could be warm and affectionate, then distant or cruel. He would encourage me in my career and offer really great advice. He'd check-in on me, congratulate me, express how proud he was of me. How beautiful he thought I was and how intelligent I was. But he also yelled at me, accused me of ‚Äúvictimizing‚Äù myself when I cried, and made degrading jokes about things we had done. He also crossed physical boundaries in ways that scared me, like grabbing my face when I spoke during an argument. He told me I made him act the way he did. That I was pulling it out of him, making him act ""not like himself"", and that his ego was too big to deal with me. It was emotionally exhausting and ruined some of my confidence.

I finally blocked him a few weeks ago after he told me he was ‚Äúdone with me‚Äù during an argument, then started texting me again like nothing happened. Going no contact has helped a bit, but I still feel hooked emotionally and physically. Everyone else sees him as this brilliant, admired person, and I feel like I met someone completely different.

\*\*\*

She watched the sky tear open as a low hum found her‚Äîa tuning-fork vibration in the glass, her jaw, the thin skin over her heart.

Her apartment was a cube of blue shadow, the city‚Äôs lights dimmed by frost on the windows and an aurora‚Äîgreen, pea-soup yellow, hospital-pink‚Äîspilling in ribbons over the skyline. *Far north for Philadelphia, even in March.*

She stood at the window, pressing her forehead to the pane. The glass trembled against her skull as she tracked the fractal glow above the Ben Franklin Bridge, colors shifting in slow, mesmerized rolls.

From the next room, the television muttered the governor‚Äôs briefing, volume low enough to lose every third word. The signal snapped with static; turning her head left a bleeding afterimage across the walls.

The hum rose.

Mira recalled first hearing it two days ago‚Äîa faint pressure in her fillings, a mosquito whine beneath car alarms. In the ER that night, everyone complained only of headaches and dizziness. Now it thrummed in her marrow.

Her phone lay face down on the table, its screen an oily mirror reflecting the city below, lit in pale blue and toxic green.

A SEPTA trolley crawled the intersection, sparks popping under ice-choked wires. Sidewalks were empty; brownstone lights blinked in wordless Morse. The river behind the bridge lay thick as antifreeze, ice floes glowing beneath the aurora.

Her breath fogged the glass. She traced a circle around the bridge before wiping it away. The cold crept in‚Äîor maybe it was the hum‚Äîor the chill she‚Äôd carried since Matt vanished. *Impossible to say.*

She glanced at her phone‚Äîno buzz, only a truncated alert from her shift captain: *ALL STAFF NEEDED, NOW*‚Äîtimestamped three hours ago.

She should go in, call someone, do something. But the hum rattled her teeth, and the city felt like a mouthful of tinfoil.

The TV in the living room went black, then flickered back on with a three-second lag. The audio was a faint hiss, as if the broadcast whispered through a straw.

She moved closer, joints stiff, and nudged a can of seltzer on the counter. Inside, bubbles quivered with every pulse of sound.

She hovered at the doorway. The screen was a skittering blank streaked with razor-thin bands of color. It ticked like an insect caught under glass.

On screen, the governor‚Äôs hands left ghostly trails; his lips shaped open syllables‚Äîsilent and unnerving‚Äîa cruel ventriloquism.

Mira sniffed, then wiped at her nose with the heel of her palm, the cold slick almost sticky against her skin. On the screen, the governor‚Äôs features jittered, microseconds out of sync with the rest of him.

The hum built, stuttering for a moment, then surged‚Äîa pressure so dense it seemed to seize the house itself.

Just as she braced for it to peak, *everything snapped off.*

Not just the TV. Every light folded in on itself. The kitchen clock went blank; the fridge shuddered and exhaled a last cold sigh.

Even the radiant halo from the streetlamps vanished, leaving the apartment a pure, uncut darkness‚Äîthe kind she‚Äôd only known as a child during blackouts, when the world shrank to the radius of her own breathing.

Mira‚Äôs heart climbed her throat. She waited for the hum to come back, but it was gone too‚Äîvacuumed out of the air.

*No EMF,* she thought. *Not even a whine from the neighbors‚Äô ancient router.*

She tested another breath. The silence was total.

The aurora light, filtered through the window, was now the only illumination‚Äîunsteady and thick, as if the sky were bleeding color down the walls.

She slipped her hand along the edge of the sofa, found her phone, thumbed the button. *Nothing.* The display was dead black. Had it run down, or‚Äî

A crash from the hallway, then voices: high, panicked, arguing.

Mira‚Äôs feet were heavy, but she moved anyway, crossing the carpet with the caution of someone baiting a wild animal.

Her hands shook as she reached for the knob. The static from the wall scraped the nerves in her teeth.

It was an old habit‚Äîbracing for the next thing to go wrong: the circuit breaker, the ceiling, her own pulse.

Out in the corridor, every fixture was dead.

The neighbors‚Äô door‚Äîthe one opposite with the sticker of Our Lady‚Äîstood ajar, and there was an ugly scuff of something‚Äîcoffee or blood or sauce‚Äîsmeared across the threshold.

Mira called out, voice paper-thin, and nothing replied but the click of her own tongue against the roof of her mouth.

Another crash sounded above her, followed by a thud and a string of frantic, muffled swears. Fifth floor, stairwell.

She followed.

Each landing was colder than the last. On 3, a whimpering, animal sound‚Äîthen a sharp, wet cough.

She found him at the turn: a man, fortyish, in a Temple sweatshirt and basketball shorts despite the weather. Crumpled on his back, mouth lolling toward his shoulder, skin sallow and slack.

Mira crouched, fingers at the carotid, fighting the urge to recoil from his cold skin. *No pulse.*

She tilted his head, opened the jaw, dug knuckles into his sternum. Nothing.

She started compressions‚Äîheel of palm over heart. *Crack.*

The ribs gave on the second pump‚Äîsoft and awful, the crunch and the way tissue yielded.

She expected resistance, the bounce-back of real flesh, but her palm kept sinking as if she'd missed‚Äîpressing dead air.

As if the skin had been hollowed, or filled with cold vapor that remembered what it once was.

She tried again, switching hands. Her push met less and less‚Äîthe man's chest thinning, parting into static.

By the fourth compression she was nearly elbow-deep, and the man‚Äîeyes open between plea and accusation‚Äîdid not twitch.

There was a resonance then, a tone that seemed to rise from the stairwell itself‚Äînot sharp, but so dense it made her vision contract at the edges.

It rolled up from the rebar and drywall, the way thunder does inside a parking garage‚Äîfull, architectural, almost beautiful.

The blue light from outside had puddled at the base of the stairwell‚Äôs window, refracting through safety glass covered in thousands of hairline fractures.

The light moved with the hum, writhing in the cracks, and every time she blinked, the window seemed to change shape.

Her hands stank of ozone and silver polish.

She looked down at the man, saw the bloom of blood at his lips‚Äîtoo dark, too thin, almost black.

Mira pinched the skin at his neck, willing it to snap back, to do *anything* but stay deathly still.

She watched her own hands flicker in the blue light, stuttering into double images with each cycle.

The air hung thick as hospital sheets left too long in the dryer.

Her scalp prickled, fine hairs along her arms standing not in fear, but in slow, rising awe.

She sat back on her heels, listening.

The man‚Äôs body was beginning to lose its boundaries‚Äîat first just the skin, which seemed to haze at the edges, then deeper, as if the muscles and veins were being disassembled by an invisible current.

She reached out and, without quite meaning to, touched his forearm.

Her fingers passed through at the top layer‚Äînot soft exactly, but resisting her with the texture of high-tension silk.

It was like trying to grasp a shadow made of sugar glass.

She thought: *This is not resuscitation. This is translation.*

Mira stood.

Her knees were weak from the stairs‚Äîor from the way the world buckled around them now; she couldn‚Äôt be sure.

Above, the aurora fanned out‚Äîbrighter and lower than before‚Äîtextures in the light like velvet run backward over bone.

The stairwell echoed empty, her footsteps the only sound. Each flight up, the air grew colder and thinner, the walls leaking condensation that felt almost oily under her palm.

The smell changed, too‚Äîsour with ammonia, or the ghost of bleach, the kind they used at the hospital after a really bad night.

On the sixth floor roof, the door‚Äôs magnet was dead.

She shouldered it open and was hit by a wind sharp as knives, carrying a taste of iron and scorched copper.

The city had gone mostly black‚Äîjust a handful of emergency reds blinking from the decks of the refinery, and the green ribbon of the bridge, lit by the sky‚Äôs spill and not much else.

Far off, sirens tried to howl, but the sound was thin, strangled by the humming‚Äînow so loud and slow it felt *tectonic.*

She took three steps onto the tar paper, aimless.

The sky hung nearer than it had ever been‚Äîclose enough to reveal the granularity of its colors, lavender and bile green mixing at the seams, sometimes sparking a thread of white so pure it made her teeth ache.

The light bled down the parapet, pooled around her shoes, then climbed her jeans.

Her hands, when she looked, surprised her‚Äîveins lit blue and pink from beneath, blood in wrists and throat giving off a soft, sickle-moon glow.

She flexed, and the light inside pulsed with the hum‚Äînot quite regular, but insistent.

She shuffled forward, sneakers slapping wetly on the roof membrane.

Cold wind cut through all six layers she'd thrown on. She tucked her hands into her armpits, then yanked them out, unable to bear the pressure against her own skin.

Pins and needles everywhere‚Äîsharp and glassy like a just-shaved scalp.

Mira edged toward the parapet, the city falling away on all sides.

The sky shed itself in slow, extravagant ribbons.

She thought of Matt‚Äîher brother, first to see the pink aurora, to joke about it, to paint his face with glow sticks the night it started‚Äîand how he'd vanished, a wordless subtraction.

She imagined him out there, his own hands bright with this same inside-out light, watching with her from the other side of the river, or the sky, or wherever they'd sent him.

The hum pressed in, flattening thought to a single metallic taste.

Each breath clattered, lungs barely able to keep pace with the oscillation.

She remembered the old emergency drills‚Äî*duck under your desk, stay away from windows*‚Äîbut all she wanted now was to be closer to whatever was calling.

She climbed onto the lip of the roof.

When I make it double it is considerably less aromatic and more 'heavy' closer to filter coffee.

I have the grinding at 2.

1ojyzis,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojyzis,How I beat the 0 likes trap on hinge and got consistent matches,"
I used to have another account u/lucifer-diaries where I was posting my journey from going 0-100 matches on hinge but someone from r/tinder reported my account for some stupid reason and my account got banned and I couldn't post anymore. 

At its peak my posts were getting 2-3 million views on average and my dms blew up like crazy mostly from guys who wanted more of my openers and prompts. But some also wanted profile reviews and swiping tips. So I decided I'll just write a book on it where i go in detail about how to set up your profile pictures, how to swipe so you end up in the top pool, how to write prompts and openers. And yes I have a list of openers and prompts that work like a charm.

Anyways I've tried to summarise everthing from the book in the following post. Which was meant to be posted on my previous account but I couldn't thanks to the ban. But,nonetheless, Enjoy:) 
..................................................................

Being a 6‚Äô5 blue eyed trust fund millionaire will always be my life‚Äôs mission but it‚Äôs not my reality. I‚Äôm not even 6 feet, neither am I blue eyed nor am I a millionaire. I‚Äôm just broke as a joke but I still trade my ramen for romance, every time.


I didn‚Äôt expect my dms to blow up the way it did after posting my hinge screenshots on reddit. Although I‚Äôve replied to most of you guys with questions on my profile, openers and even my prompts, but new dms keep showing up. So, it‚Äôs just better i make a dedicated post regarding this. So, here we go boys.


I started using dating apps few years ago mostly to have fun dates like everyone around me but all I got was uninterested matches if at all any with a few likes here and there until they turn into uninterested matches too. Leaving me with 0 likes and 0 dates. So now after installing and uninstalling hinge multiple times I‚Äôve figured out a few things which have helped me finally get dates from hinge.



*Here‚Äôs what I was doing wrong and how I fixed it*


###1) Surge Swiping:

Back in the day I would go doom swiping until I‚Äôve seen everyone in the my area and used all my likes. Which the algorithm deemed as a low quality behaviour and shadow banned my profile hence the 0 likes.

*HOW I FIXED IT*

I deleted my account and made a new profile with new pictures and prompts. When it came to swiping. I was swiping 10-12 profiles a day with right swipes on 2-3 profiles. Did this for the initial 5-7 days so the algorithm sees me a high quality user and keeps pushing my profile to more people, which it did. Within the first week i was getting better looking people in my swiping stack and i was receiving consistent likes every day with some roses too. I think my profile might have been on standouts. Interesting enough the less I used the app for swiping the more likes I was getting. 

###2) Bad Poses & Expressions In My Pictures:

I was thinking that getting a picture in a cool spot would be enough for girls to right swipe on me but I rarely got any likes on my pictures. I don‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôm the ugliest man on the planet but I kinda knew that I didn‚Äôt have then best facial expression while posing for a picture which certainly would be off-putting on a dating app.

*HOW I FIXED IT*

I went on pinterest and looked up ‚Äúmale model portfolios‚Äù and ‚Äúdate pics men‚Äù. Saved the pictures I liked. Made a list of cool places i knew around me: cafes, hotel lobby, parks, museums etc and figured what kinda clothes I should wear for each picture. Then I visited every spot over the weekend with my friend. I clicked his pictures first in the angles I wanted so he has a reference to replicate for me (saved a lot of time and phone storage). Slowly but surely I had over 10 pics that made me look like a solid 8 rather than a struggling 5. Once I had them on my new profile the picture that got me the most likes was the one where I had goofy expression while smiling at a restaurant table. So it's better to optimise your profile to be more human than hot. Hinge is a dating app after all so embrace your warm welcoming even funny side. 

###3) Prompts Were Not Engaging

Initially I used the prompts like a QnA hoping that girls with similar interests would engage.

i go crazy for: football matches

we‚Äôll get along if: you‚Äôre listen to the weeknd on repeat

I unwind by: going for a walk 

But this got me no where. 

*HOW I FIXED IT*

I started testing a few prompts and I noticed that I got more likes and comments on a funny response than a intellectual answer so I switched my prompts accordingly and with time my likes on my prompts got consistent, refer my other reddit posts for examples. In my experience it‚Äôs just better to show your interests and hobbies via the pictures and use the prompts as a funny bait to get the match, ‚Äúshow don‚Äôt tell‚Äù.

###4) Stop Using Boring Openers

I‚Äôve never been a big texter. So this was the hardest part for me. Initially I used to text ‚Äúhi, wyd‚Äù but that never got responded to so i switched too ‚Äúhi, what‚Äôs you fav song‚Äù which got me replies but after a few messages the conversation died mostly because I didn‚Äôt guide the conversation properly into asking her out but I understood that she was replying to me and not necessarily chatting with me. So i had to change that. 

*HOW I FIXED IT*

I was aware that any girl I matched with had way more on going chats than me, so my text had to stand out. I tried a few being funny sometimes sarcastic and they worked well. But nothing came close to the success I had with describing what i thought of her through her pics or something that she wrote on her profiles. So, since then I‚Äôve stuck to my winner. I‚Äôve posted plenty on reddit for you to get an idea. But here are a few examples.

 

BAD: i like your eyes 

GOOD: Dear diary, even if the sky was filled with stars i‚Äôd still rather see them in your eyes.

BAD: you are pretty

GOOD: You look like you're out of a fairytale

Yes, these sound very over the top and corny but they work. 


###5) Ask Her Out ASAP

Whenever I had a good conversation with a girl on hinge. I got her instagram in hopes that i will ask her out later. But with time the conversations died with the girl and we became strangers again. 

*HOW I FIXED IT*

So, instead of asking for her instagram I started asking them out on hinge for a walk/ ice cream/ coffee/ drinks anything that is easy to say yes to. I avoid dinners because they are expensive plus a bigger commitment for a first date. If they say yes. I ask for a their number and call them later the same day or immediately. I do this mostly because I like talking on the phone. But with time I‚Äôve realised that if the girl gets on a call with you before a date she is more likely to show up. So, I‚Äôve made calling mandatory for myself.



###IT'S POSSIBLE 


Look, I didn‚Äôt figure this out overnight. It took me years of trial and error. But once I figured a few things out about the hinge algorithm getting dates has become easier. I wanted to include more info on this with pics/screenshots besides the text but I know this sub has it's rules and I want to respect that and posted that elsewhere. I've tried my best to briefly explain my learning in this post hopefully it was helpful for you guys. 

Good day!

1ojyzf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OddRace1208/comments/1ojyzf4/how_walking_for_mental_clarity_can_boost_your/,How Walking for Mental Clarity Can Boost Your Focus and Calm,"I used to sit at my desk, staring at the screen, willing my brain to focus. The harder I tried, the worse it got thoughts scattered like leaves in the wind. One day, frustrated, I stepped outside and walked around the block. Ten minutes later, I came back calmer, with a clear plan. That simple walk showed me something powerful: moving your body can quiet your mind.

Walking for mental clarity isn‚Äôt fancy or complicated. It‚Äôs free, easy, and works every time you give it a chance. Let‚Äôs break down why it helps and how you can make it part of your day.

# Why Walking Clears Your Head

When you‚Äôre anxious or stuck, your brain gets noisy. The same worries repeat, louder each time. Sitting still keeps you trapped in that loop. But when you walk, everything changes.

Your eyes see new things: a passing car, a kid on a bike, clouds moving across the sky. Your ears pick up sounds, footsteps, wind, distant laughter. This pulls your attention away from the chaos inside. Scientists say nature and gentle movement help restore focus. In simple terms, walking gives your brain a break from overthinking.

I felt this during a tough week last year. Work piled up, sleep was short, and I couldn‚Äôt think straight. One morning, instead of forcing myself to ‚Äúpower through,‚Äù I walked to the park nearby. No phone, no rush. Just one foot in front of the other. By the time I sat on a bench, my breathing slowed and the panic faded. The problem I‚Äôd been wrestling with suddenly had a solution.

# How Walking Boosts Focus

Focus isn‚Äôt about staring harder, it's about giving your mind space to work. Walking does that naturally.

As you move, blood flows better to your brain. Oxygen increases. A chemical called BDNF (think of it as brain fertilizer) grows new connections between thoughts. That‚Äôs why ideas often pop up mid-walk, not mid-meeting.

A friend of mine, a writer, keeps a small notebook in his pocket. He walks every afternoon when words won‚Äôt come. Nine times out of ten, he returns with a fresh sentence or a full paragraph. ‚ÄúThe rhythm of walking shakes loose the stuck parts,‚Äù he says. He‚Äôs right. Steady steps create steady thoughts.

Even a short 10-minute walk can sharpen your focus for hours. No need for an hour-long hike. Just enough time to let your mind wander in a good way.

# Walking to Calm Anxiety and Stress

Stress makes your body tight, shoulders up, jaw clenched, heart racing. Walking unwinds all of that.

Each step sends a message to your nervous system: *You‚Äôre safe. You‚Äôre moving. You‚Äôre okay.* Your heart rate settles. Breathing deepens. Over time, regular walks lower cortisol, the stress hormone that keeps you on edge.

I started walking after lunch when work stress peaked. At first, I worried about ‚Äúwasting time.‚Äù But I returned to my desk lighter, kinder to myself and others. Colleagues noticed. One even asked, ‚ÄúWhat changed? You seem‚Ä¶ steadier.‚Äù I smiled and said, ‚ÄúI started walking.‚Äù

# Simple Ways to Start Walking for Mental Clarity

You don‚Äôt need a plan or perfect conditions. Start small and keep it simple.

* **Morning reset**: Walk for 5‚Äì10 minutes after waking. Leave your phone inside. Notice the air, the light, the quiet.
* **Midday break**: Step outside when work feels heavy. Circle the block once or twice. Breathe with your steps, inhale for four, exhale for four.
* **Evening wind-down**: Walk after dinner. Let the day settle. No music if you want real calm just listen to your thoughts without judging them.

Wear comfortable shoes. Dress for the weather. That‚Äôs it.

# Make It a Habit, Not a Chore

The magic isn‚Äôt in one walk, it's in doing it often. Tie it to something you already do. Walk while your coffee brews. Stroll during a phone call (earbuds in, hands free). Park farther from the store. Little moments add up.

Some days, you won‚Äôt feel like it. That‚Äôs normal. Start with one minute. One block. Motion creates motivation.

# Final Words!

Your mind isn‚Äôt broken when it‚Äôs foggy or anxious, it's just asking for movement. Walking gives it what it needs: fresh air, gentle rhythm, and a chance to breathe.

I was about to hit hacker status and I seen a reverse tunnel coming into my machine via my openvpn terminal. He went through my browsing history and accused me of cheating because I googled a thing or two about hacking. I was trying to reach hacker status on his site and was about there. I was injecting an ssh key into a user‚Äôs home directory from a temporary directory on the machine and come to find out Harris was sitting in the virtual machine deleting the key I injected stopping me from reaching hacker status and joining a team. 

Come to find out he installed a keylogger in my computer and took over all my online accounts and any new one I created! I was also locked out of one of my computers and a phone. 

My ex was cheating at the time and was seeing her ex husband who has it bad for me. He found out about this and reached out to Harris and they formed a criminal organization with a group of collection agents from work. These losers all do open relationships. 

So they slip one of the girls from the collection agency into my life who played the loving and loyal girlfriend while betraying me the entire time. She had the keys to my apartment while driving my car and made copies while I was at work. She gave Harris‚Äôs criminal organization access to my apartment and set it up for cyber attacks. Gave Harris access points at her house and my apartment and the games begin. 

He hacked 3 computers of mine overwriting my passwd using using openssl -6 salt newuser newpasswd command and editing my /etc/passwd file and then overwriting my original file locking me out of my computer! 

He flashed my Bluetooth speaker and turned it into a listening device. The device name was now bt-99 which returned a headset firmware with a Google search.  

He ran Bluesnarfer attacks and locked me out of 3 brand new iPhones. He intercepted emails to my car insurance provider stopping me from verifying my identity. My car insurance was dropped forcing my car off the road. 

Fraudulent charges on my bank card from the United Kingdom locking my bank account forcing me to have to go into the bank to unlock my account 3 different times. Green dot credit cards were purchased and the money would go lost in cyber space with no explanation from the credit card company. Had to wait for a check via snail mail for a refund 4 weeks later. 

My cell phone bill was due and my phone was supposed to be off yet it could still dial out to the woman who gave them access to do all of this? My apartment was watched and his criminal organization gained access while I wasn‚Äôt home and fentanyl was put in my coffee in an attempt to kill me. 

I have police reports filled everywhere. See more at r/Hackedvictims  Harris is a cyber criminal and a killer. This man should be behind bars and never allowed access to a computer. His group of cyber criminals r/masterhackers are all over my subreddit trying to say I have mental health issues and this never happened. I assure you that all of this happened 

I will continue on letting everyone know he is a cyber criminal! He can‚Äôt do anything more to me than he already has! It takes a hacker to catch a hacker! 

Don‚Äôt forget, see r/Hackedvictims for images and proof of 4 years of stocking and hacking!

A few months ago, I was in a relationship that felt different, the kind where you start planning your future in quiet moments, like what kind of coffee you‚Äôll drink together in your old age or where you‚Äôll spend Christmas. She made me believe I was finally safe to care deeply again.

Then one day, without a fight, without warning, she just disconnected. The good morning texts stopped. The voice notes got shorter. I could feel her slipping away before she even said it was over. When she finally did, it felt rehearsed, like she‚Äôd already said goodbye weeks before.

I tried to be mature. I told her I understood. But the truth is, I didn‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt go from ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to silence overnight. It‚Äôs been months, and I still replay her laugh in my head and the one that used to make my day feel lighter.

I wanted to dig a little deeper into this and as it turns out it might be earlier than you think. The thing is:   
‚òï The half-life of caffeine is 5 to 6 hours, meaning if you drink a cup at 4 PM, you are likely to still have half of that caffeine at about 10 PM. However, caffeine can last longer in some people depending on genetics, body mass, hormones and even light exposure during the day.   
  
A few more interesting things:   
1. Your CYP1A2 gene determines depending on if you're a fast or slow metabolizer of caffeine, so slow metabolizers could be losing sleep if they drink coffee in the morning.  
  
2. Exercise in the afternoon could delay the clearance of caffeine, since your body will act as if it's a stimulant during recovery.   
  
3. Caffeine blocks adenosine, the chemical in the brain that makes you sleepy. Once it wears off, that ""sleep pressure"" comes rushing back, which is the reason we start to crash hard!

1ojyqgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinerLive/comments/1ojyqgo/surkhail_selling_to_people_wholl_never_pay/,Surkhail - Selling to people who'll never pay,"Surhail, a founder from Pakistan living in Germany is building an online accelerator for entrepreneurs rejected by traditional programs.

While his heart is in the right place wanting to help the 97% who get rejected, we quickly discover a fundamental problem with his business model. People who apply to accelerators are looking for free money and support, not to pay ‚Ç¨150 per hour for mentorship.

We explore the psychology of startup founders, why they're incredibly tight with spending, and how his matching service might work better if he stops positioning himself as serving ""rejects"".

Listen to this episode under ""Finer Live"" on Spotify or Apple Podcasts.

**FULL RECAP**

**Surhail:** ""So it's AIMentor. It's an open accelerator for the founders rejected by traditional accelerators. The startup accelerators, they reject about 97% of applicants. And what happens to them, to those people, they are rejected and in despair.""

*I was immediately struck by the romantic appeal of this vision. There's something deeply compelling about building for the underdog, for the 97% left behind. Surhail had immigrated from Pakistan to Germany, worked full-time in med tech, and had already failed twice at entrepreneurship. This felt personal to him - he'd been rejected too.*

**Eli:** ""Is it your conviction that people get rejected from accelerators for reasons that have nothing to do with the quality of their ideas or the quality of their work or them as people?""

**Surhail:** ""No, not at all. I think the reason for rejection is not racism or anything like that. It's first thing is exclusivity. So scarcity of spots. They take in cohorts of maybe 50 startups, and during that time, they don't give you personal, individualized, customized mentorship. They give you a coworking space, and they do weekly workshops. And then there is a demo day where you pitch to the investors.""

*This was encouraging. Surhail wasn't building his business on grievance or conspiracy theories. He saw the problem as structural - a supply and demand mismatch created by the physical limitations of traditional accelerators. But I sensed there might be some tension ahead about how to position this insight.*

...

**Eli:** ""When you said I want to build an accelerator for people who were rejected from other accelerators, I think at least as a social vision, it has power as a movement. You've also painted the enemy. Maybe you're not fully aware of that.""

**Surhail:** ""No, I don't want to do that.""

**Eli:** ""In marketing, it is said that it is good to paint an enemy. Not because you actually want to fight or win, but because you want to attract people who perceive that same enemy as an enemy. The people who have just been rejected by an accelerator, unless they have tremendous capacity for ownership and agency, would think the accelerator sucks.""

*This was one of those moments where the marketing reality crashes into someone's noble intentions. Surhail wanted to help people, not wage war. But the people he wanted to help were likely carrying some bitter blame. There's tremendous marketing power in pointing that anger at a target, even if you don't mean to be divisive about it.*

...

**Surhail:** ""The first thing is reaching out to startup founders directly who are rejected by accelerators. But the problem is where do they hang? Where do they gather? Nowhere. There is not a single platform that they are on. They are scattered everywhere.""

**Eli:** ""And they're also in a state of dejected moping. Being rejected is distinctly unpleasant, maybe even humiliating, which means the next step of their journey is to retreat inwards and maybe even step away from the world for a period of time.""

*This was the first real red flag. The target market wasn't just scattered - they were actively hiding. When I've been rejected from something important, the last thing I want to do is join a community of other rejects. The psychology was working against the business model from the start.*

...

**Eli:** ""What's the upside for an accelerator to refer the people they rejected to you?""

**Surhail:** ""One thing is they will get commission on the referral. Second is they can come out as a wholesome body for all founders, not only exclusive to a few who they accept, but as someone who cares about the founding community.""

**Eli:** ""An accelerator presumably makes its money from equity, from investment into successful startups. So I don't necessarily see how some cash flow revenue from referrals would be meaningful to them financially. The other side is really cool though - painting themselves as doing good is equivalent to corporations setting aside funds for donation.""

*I could see Surhail grappling with something I've watched many idealistic entrepreneurs struggle with: the gap between how they think the world should work and how it actually does work. He believed accelerators fundamentally existed to help founders achieve their dreams. I suspected they existed to make money by finding the next unicorns.*

**Surhail:** ""Think of why does an accelerator exist? The only thing that it's based on, of course, making money as a business. But how it started? What was the dream of an accelerator? So it wants to help startups, to help founders, to achieve their dreams.""

**Eli:** ""I think you might be a little too idealistic. I don't think that's why accelerators get started, actually. I think accelerators get started either because people believe they will be able to uncover these uncut gems ready to become the next Mark Zuckerbergs. Or they're sponsored by the government. I actually think that goodness of heart is not a core incentive.""

*This led us into an unexpectedly deep philosophical discussion about individual potential versus systems of competition. Surhail quoted Islamic principles about everyone achieving their highest potential by doing good for others. I shared my Soviet background and how it shaped my view of equality versus excellence. We found common ground in the idea that everyone can be the best version of themselves without direct competition.*

**Surhail:** ""It's a credit based system. Each credit is worth ‚Ç¨50. Once you sign up as a founder, you earn two credits. Two free credits are given to you, and you are matched with three mentors. You can use these two free credits to unlock those mentors. If you like them, you can book a one hour session with them, which will cost three credits. So ‚Ç¨150. And out of these 150, ‚Ç¨50 are taken by iMentor for sustainability, and ‚Ç¨100 goes to the mentor.""

*Finally, the business model. It sounded reasonable on the surface - mentor matchmaking with a try-before-you-buy approach at a lower cost than hiring mentors directly. But as soon as I heard the numbers, alarm bells started going off based on my five years of selling services to founders.*

**Eli:** ""Maybe it's the business model. ‚Ç¨150 might be a blocker for someone who doesn't have money and who wants to start a startup.""

*This opened the floodgates to what I consider one of the most important and counterintuitive insights about selling to entrepreneurs.*

**Eli:** ""I spent the last five years offering services and selling products to founders. It is a ridiculously stubborn bunch. Founders are extraordinarily tight with spending. Not because they don't have money - that was a crucial understanding. Many founders have jobs, well paying jobs, savings often, sometimes in the dozens or hundreds of thousands of euros, which they will not touch at all for the purpose of funding their business.""

**Surhail:** ""Mentors are very costly though.""

**Eli:** ""They are as costly as their quality. You're paying your mentors ‚Ç¨100 an hour. If you can find mentors who are willing to take ‚Ç¨100 an hour, then any other sufficiently motivated person can do that. So it's not like you're offering something unavailable elsewhere.""

*I had to deliver what felt like a hard truth: the people Surhail wanted to help had specifically demonstrated through their behavior that they didn't want to pay for this kind of service. They had applied to accelerators precisely because they wanted to get money, not spend it.*

**Eli:** ""People who've just been rejected from accelerators do not have their credit card in hand. In fact, they've shown through their behavior that they do not want to pay for this. They want somebody else to pay for this. I can almost guarantee you, they apply to an accelerator so they don't need to spend any money on this. They expected to have the services provided and even get paid, and then they didn't.""

*I watched this land. Surhail had selected a niche that was not only hard to find and demoralized, but fundamentally opposed to the business model. The very act of applying to free accelerators revealed their mindset about money.*

...

**Surhail:** ""That's where we are at. It's definitely, as you said, and you pointed out beautifully and put it all together. This platform of yours, this podcast, it's a way to align perspectives. It's a way to reach out to people who are at the spot where they need help, and they need guidance.""

*There was something beautiful about this moment. Despite having his business model challenged pretty thoroughly, Surhail was gracious and reflective. He understood that the mentor matchmaking service itself had value - he just needed to find the right people, the ones who actually had their credit cards in hand and were looking for mentors, not free money.*

**Surhail:** ""I pivot a lot. Pivoting is like drinking a cup of coffee. That's what I'm doing.""

*And there it was - the entrepreneurial spirit that actually matters. Not the romantic vision of helping the downtrodden, though that's admirable. Not the clever business model or the perfect niche. Just the willingness to see clearly, accept feedback, and change direction when the path isn't working. That's the quality that might actually get Surhail to where he wants to go.*

From what I‚Äôve seen as a franchise consultant, service-based franchises (like home improvement, cleaning, or health and wellness) are still on the rise because they‚Äôre affordable to start and meet everyday needs. Food and coffee brands still have strong potential too, especially niche, experience-based ones.

# The Essence of Women‚Äôs Portraiture

Women‚Äôs portrait photography is not just about capturing a face ‚Äî it‚Äôs about revealing emotion, confidence, and inner strength through light and connection.  
At [Kuvaajankulma.com](https://www.kuvaajankulma.com/valokuvaaja), I believe that every woman deserves to be seen in her truest, most radiant light.  
Each session we create is built on trust, emotion, and artistry ‚Äî combining technical mastery with a sensitivity that brings out genuine beauty.

[Posing tips for women's ](https://preview.redd.it/hqabcwq2v8yf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=59a5610f2615aaa5a9b897518fb154da73a530c3)

# What Makes a Women‚Äôs Portrait Truly Successful

A great portrait doesn‚Äôt happen by accident. It‚Äôs the result of thoughtful planning, trust, and understanding between the photographer and the subject.

# Trust ‚Äì The Foundation of Every Connection

Trust transforms nervousness into confidence. Before every photoshoot, we take time to talk about style, comfort, and expectations. When a woman feels respected and at ease, her natural grace shines through every frame.

# Light ‚Äì The Photographer‚Äôs Softest Tool

Light paints the soul of the image. We use soft, sculpting light to highlight facial symmetry and skin texture, creating a glow that feels authentic and timeless.

# Planning ‚Äì Small Details, Big Impact

Everything matters ‚Äî clothing, background, pose, and color palette. When these elements harmonize, the result is not just a photo but a story told in light.

# Posing Tips for Women

Posing is the rhythm of portrait photography ‚Äî the subtle language that communicates mood and energy.

# Classic Poses

* Hands on hips create structure and confidence.
* Turning the shoulder toward the camera softens the look.
* A glance over the shoulder adds mystery and timeless charm.

You can find even more inspiration in our guide [‚ÄúPose Ideas for Women ‚Äì Find Your Own Style in Front of the Camera‚Äù](https://www.kuvaajankulma.com/post/poseerausideat-naisille-l%C3%B6yd%C3%A4-oma-tyyli-kameran-edess%C3%A4).

# Relaxed Lifestyle Poses

Movement adds life. We might capture laughter, a casual step, or a quiet coffee moment ‚Äî these gestures tell the story of who you are.  
Check out more pose inspiration on our [photography tips blog](https://kuvaajankulman-valokuvaus-vinkit.blogspot.com/2025/10/pseerauideat-naisten-muotokuvaus.html).

# Seated and Chair Poses

A chair can be a perfect prop. A slight forward lean builds connection; crossed legs project confidence; and a hand resting on the cheek ‚Äî an eternal classic ‚Äî brings quiet elegance.

# Comfort Is the Key to Confidence

# Creating a Safe and Supportive Atmosphere

We begin each session with conversation, laughter, and empathy. The best photos come when the subject feels safe, valued, and understood.  
For newcomers, we start simple ‚Äî leaning gently against a wall or sitting naturally ‚Äî to build comfort and confidence step by step.

# Guiding Beginners with Ease

Our approach is gentle and intuitive. If you‚Äôve never done a professional shoot before, we‚Äôll guide your poses naturally. You won‚Äôt have to ‚Äúperform‚Äù ‚Äî just be yourself, and we‚Äôll take care of the rest.

# Camera Angles That Flatter Every Woman

# Low, High, and Side Angles ‚Äî When to Use Each

* **Low angle:** elongates the body, adds power and grace.
* **High angle:** softens facial features and creates intimacy.
* **Side profile:** emphasizes the jawline and adds drama.

The right angle reveals not only beauty but emotion ‚Äî how you want to be seen.

# Elegance Without Objectification

We believe elegance is about emotion, not exposure.  
Our portraits focus on strength, serenity, and individuality ‚Äî where sensuality is suggested through light, not skin.

# Theme Inspirations

* **Nature & Elements:** forest, water, wind, soft daylight.
* **Fantasy & Vintage:** fairytale, ethereal, or timeless retro vibes.
* **Black & White Aesthetic:** contrast and depth revealing emotion.

# The Power of Light ‚Äì Softness as the Secret Ingredient

Light transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary. A soft, well-placed light wraps the subject gently, flattering every texture and curve.

# Best Lighting Techniques for Women‚Äôs Portraits

|Technique|Description|Purpose|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Butterfly**|Light from above and front|Highlights cheekbones and symmetry|
|**Clamshell**|Two lights, top and bottom|Creates smooth, even skin tone|
|**Broad**|Light on the visible side of the face|Adds warmth and openness|
|**Narrow**|Light from the shadow side|Slimming, natural effect|

üí° **Pro tip:** Use a white or silver reflector to soften shadows and create that captivating ‚Äúcatchlight‚Äù in the eyes.

# Outdoor Portraits ‚Äì Embracing Nature and Natural Light

# Golden Hour and Weather Magic

Cloudy skies bring even light; golden hour gives warmth and romance.  
We love using nature‚Äôs textures ‚Äî trees, stone walls, stairways ‚Äî to frame the subject and add narrative depth.

# Styling and Wardrobe Choices

# How Outfit and Accessories Shape the Story

Long dresses, flowing fabrics, and thoughtful accessories create timeless elegance.  
For glamorous portraits, we use soft lighting and reflective surfaces to add gentle shimmer to the skin.

Need styling ideas? Explore our [portrait photography tips podcast](https://www.kuvaajankulma.com/podcast) ‚Äî where we discuss creative direction, posing, and confidence on camera.

# Post-Processing ‚Äì Enhancing Natural Beauty

# Retouching with Subtlety

Editing should never erase personality. We remove small distractions but preserve skin texture and the subject‚Äôs natural glow.

# Color and Harmony

We fine-tune tones and contrast to ensure everything ‚Äî from lighting to skin hue ‚Äî feels cohesive and refined.  
Our goal: a portrait that feels *real*, yet elevated.

1ojyiyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/1ojyiyc/lightweight_coffee_maker/,Lightweight Coffee Maker,"Hello,   
I always like to bring a coffee machine to my trips, it might not be ultralight but I consider it my luxury item.   
For the last few years I've been bringing my aeropress go which is about 320g.   
  
Lately though I wanted to see if I could find a moka pot, since that is my favourite coffee to drink and I found this on amazon [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CF1RKDZ9?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CF1RKDZ9?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) (obvs not affiliate or anything) which is listed at 193g on the page.   
  
I bought it since it was cheap and weighed it on my scale and it turns out it is 155g so half of the aeropress.  
It can be dismantled, the spout can be unscrewed for carrying and the coffee comes out nice. It's alluminium so not as nice as a steel moka but steel is heavier so...

My cook kit currently is  

1. 350ml lixada titanium pot with lid (84g) 
2. Gram counter gear thermo pocket (34g) 
3. The moka pot (155g) 
4. Tito Ti long spork (16g) 
5. trangia (118g) 
6. Evernew ti cross stand (16g) 
7. Vargo fuel bottle (32g) 
8. Tomshoo Titanium Windshield 3 pieces (10g)

for a total of 465g which i think is not too bad for including a coffee maker :)  
I could obviously save weight by swapping the trangia but I really like it.   
the 350ml cup fits perfectly under the coffee maker and it is enough for my homemade dehydrated meals.

Now think about Deepika and Katrina. Bigger stars. Have you ever seen where they live or their building complex?  

Even Karan who is a drama queen protected his kids. Ultimately the ones who want to desperately get papped ask for attention ‚Ä¶

There are private entrances in these apartment buildings and even a normal complex in Mumbai will not allow paps to come in and photograph normal people. PR alert!

Since I was little, she‚Äôs treated my mom like garbage. She‚Äôs always manipulated my dad and spread gossip about my mom‚Äôs side of the family. She acts like she‚Äôs the victim when really she‚Äôs the one turning everyone against each other. If you want to understand the full situation, I explained more in my post *‚ÄúMy parents are getting divorced :(‚Äù* on my profile.

When her husband died about six years ago, she suddenly became obsessed with my dad. She clings to him constantly, calls him every day, and takes up all his time. Every weekend, he‚Äôs out with her ‚Äî never with us. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time my parents and I did something together as a family. She‚Äôs taken him away from us completely.

The worst part is how *possessive* she is of him. One time my parents finally went out together (which was super rare ‚Äî I had to literally beg my dad to take my mom for coffee), and while they were out, my grandmother called him and said: ‚ÄúHey \[nickname\], how about you and I go to France this Saturday?‚Äù I was in shock. Like‚Ä¶ she knows he has a wife and daughters, right? It‚Äôs like she wants him all to herself.

She also loves humiliating me in front of her guests. Whenever I visit her, she says things like, ‚ÄúUgh, \[my name\], why don‚Äôt you ever come see me? You hate me so much, what did I ever do to deserve that?‚Äù She says it in this fake, dramatic way that makes everyone stare at me like I‚Äôm the bad one.

I told her once that I didn‚Äôt like it, and she apologized, but a few days ago she did it again, worse than ever.

I stopped talking to her after that, and now my dad is mad at *me*. He yelled at me, called me awful things, and told me I was the one in the wrong.

My mom, depending on how she feels she can be either very supportive or very dismissive. Saying things like : I never told you it wasn't okay to like girls (she literally told me it was impossible for me to like girls when I was 14, ""because you've always been with guys""), and stuff like : there was no way of knowing you were unwell (I tried suicide for the first time at 9, and started dressing up like my brother at 10, she then sent me to an all girl school, suicid attempt were numerous until I came out, especially at the family home). 

So yeah. Let's hope today she'll be on the supportive spectrum. 

I hate feeling like this. I wish I was closer to my mom (we used to be so close before I moved out). She all blames it on the drugs and influences in my teenage years/young adulthood (I've been sober from hard drugs for 7 years and alcohol for three, I'm now 30 with a wife and 2 kids). And I'm still petrified at the idea that this is gonna go south and I'll have to walk out yet again. 

I just really hope that today will be a good talk. Recently she's been better. Since my coming out too, she just doesn't put any effort into seing me. 

I knoow, you'll tell me : why don't you just forget about her. I went no contact for 10 years. We're both getting older, I want my mom in my life. I just need a little bit of love from my community and support. Because it might go well, but it might not. And I just needed some place to put it off my chest.

I‚Äôm looking for someone to take over my lease in our beautiful, updated apartment on 3rd Street in Park Slope, starting December and running through August next year, with the option to extend or sign a full lease after that. You‚Äôll be joining two wonderful roommates who already live in the apartment.

Some other details about the apartment and location:

\* sun-drenched and entirely south facing in the heart of Park Slope

\* two full bathrooms (not half bath)

\* washer/dryer in-unit!

\* second floor (barely a walk-up)

\* heat and hot water included

\* pet friendly! but space would be better suited to a small dog/cat

\* 1 block away from Whole Foods

\* 5 blocks from F/G/R trains

\* Faces a beautiful park

\* Historic and picturesque 3rd street is a gorgeous, clean and well-maintained street

\* 1 block from tons of restaurants, bars, coffee shops and markets on 5th Ave. Everything you could possibly need is a short walking distance in every direction. And then two blocks for the markets, restaurants and banks on 7th Ave.

\* 1 block from the famous Park Slope 5th Ave Farmer's market every weekend

\* 1 stop away from Atlantic Station which has the B/D/Q/R/2/3/4/5 and LIRR

\* 5 blocks from Prospect Park

They‚Äôre both very clean, respectful, and considerate; keeping a tidy home is important to them. They really value clear and open communication and appreciate someone approachable when it comes to sorting out any house matters. Overall, they‚Äôre friendly and easy to get along with, and they hope to find someone who shares those values to keep the apartment comfortable and pleasant for everyone BLM and LGBTQIA+ friendly.

Work from home ok, but as both other roommates are also remote, preference would be for someone who commutes at least part-time or works from another location.

No preferences to age or gender! Just be cool, tidy, respectful and open to communication. One of your future roomies will likely get a cat, as it is her destiny, so cat-friendly persons preferred! Please let us know of any allergies or aversions.

If you're interested and feel that you'd be a good fit, PLEASE REACH OUT ASAP! We can provide additional info, videos, photos and would be happy to schedule virtual or in-person visits. Thanks!",2,1761827045.0,NYCapartments,5,0.75,False
1ojy87b,https://www.reddit.com/r/StraightTalk/comments/1ojy87b/searching_for_purpose_and_ultimate_truth_of_life/,searching for purpose and ultimate truth of life ? here is that final perfection,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
