1ihb7kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1ihb7kb/dont_pour_your_savings_into_witchcraft/,Don’t Pour Your Savings into Witchcraft,"I’ve been practicing for about 5 years. One piece I wish i listened to was don’t buy everything you see nor everything at once.

As a baby witch when you ask for advice on what to get, only listen to what truly absolutely speaks to you. If that’s stones, get a couple of tumbles and start there. if that’s candles, get a white 7 day and begin placing intention. If that’s divination, invest in a tarot deck, runes or an oracle.

Always learn first too. whenever people post on what to get, BOOKS! even if you’re not a reader, find a good audio book. instead of asking what books, ask what book is good for learning crystals, i’d say the crystal bible. etc. find what you like and what you’re drawn too!! 

Something else i’ve learned is, not everything is gonna work for you. if you’re forcing yourself to work with stones when you don’t care for them and it’s just because you’ve been recommended them, don’t!! I always tell my customers/clients your intuition in that sense trumps mine. I can feel drawn to a stone but if you prefer herbs or candles, that’s what’s gonna work best for you!

I have bought so much over the years from singing bowls, to pendulums, i have well over 10 tarot/oracle decks, i can’t count the amount of tumbles i have and so much more. some of this comes with practicing for as long as i have. a lot of this was from overconsumption and thinking i needed everything to complete a spell. a lot of things i don’t even use, so i just end up giving away. i have used my mortar and pestle ONCE 😭 i have probably 3 different pendulums and i only recently started occasionally using them. after 4 years of having at least one 😭.

i realized all of this when i started packing to move, i seriously cannot relay the amount of things i have lol. and it is a gift to be able to collect and keep the amount i do. i definitely understand that’s a privilege.

but my point with all of this, start small. start by turning the mundane into something magical. this can be kissing your mirror with lipstick once you’ve gotten ready for the day(vanity spell), charming little knick knacks you can’t part with(protection, money charms, attraction charms), stirring cinnamon into your coffee(positivity/energy) and dancing for the moon for just a few examples. 

once you’ve integrated magic in your day to day or until you know you’re ready to commit financially. and still, start small, buy what you need. your collection of tools and ingredients will grow as you do🤍",5,1738649313.0,witchcraft,3,1.0,False

1ihb5nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ihb5nr/struggling_with_exs_frustration_re_no_contact/,Struggling with ex’s frustration re: no contact,"
My ex (25) and I (26) broke up nearly a year ago. We were together for a little under a year. They started dating someone the day after we broke up (they met this person about a month beforehand, their story is they only started really talking at an event they both attended the day after and I’ve made peace with the questionable timeline) and started being pretty harsh with me about it. When I asked for space because I was blindsided and heartbroken as I had hoped we’d get back together, they told me to, essentially, get a grip and move on like they had.

We had some interactions in the following month that ranged from arguments to them crying about missing me and wishing I would just be their friend. I cut off contact in May after a particularly bad exchange, but I reached out in September (I know) because the whole thing felt unresolved and I have a hard time cutting off people entirely (I’ve had people I love pass away after a falling out). We got coffee, talked about the end of our relationship, they listened to what I shared about how I felt, and they validated my feelings. We tentatively made plans for the following month to trial friendship.

During those plans, everything went well until they said something that reopened a wound from our breakup, and I realized there was a lot of pain there that we couldn’t really resolve. They’re still with the other person so talking about our failed relationship for too long is inappropriate, and when we did brush against the topic, they would tell me they didn’t really regret anything they did and just considered it an unfortunate moment in our past. I understood we just felt differently, and I had worked so hard to heal that there really was no point to trying to convince them to feel how I felt when I knew they didn’t. I told them I cared about them, but it just didn’t seem like friendship was possible right now, and I wished them the best.

Fast forward to December, they texted me pouring their heart out about alone they felt, how they wanted to leave their girlfriend because of her personal problems but didn’t know how because she was wrapped up in their professional life, and how they regretted how they treated me and felt like they finally understood the pain they’d caused me. I told them I cared, but the choice to leave or stay with their girlfriend was theirs, and friendship was still off the table as (I didn’t tell them this part) the whole thing seemed like a mess and I knew they wanted me around to fix something I couldn’t fix for them.

Now, they pressed me for friendship again, and I told them as nothing has changed, I really think it’s best we keep on our separate paths. They tried to negotiate with me, then they told me I had made myself a stranger to them by being so averse to conflict, and when I realized they were gearing up to say cruel things I didn’t need to read, I blocked them. 

They’ve taken this as a sign that I hate them, and to be honest, I’m having a really hard time with that. I want them to be okay. I don’t want them to feel alone or unloveable. I do love them, and I’ve even said that. But I just can’t be there to support them emotionally through this. They hurt me so much, and even if you ignore that, it’s so unhealthy for them to be getting real, emotional support from me while continuing on with their girlfriend. It’s not fair for anyone. But it’s so hard to have someone I care so much about hate me and think I hate them. I’ve tried so hard to make them understand, but they just take it as me being on my avoidant high horse. I just want them to be okay.

I’m trying to maintain no contact, finally. I have such a hard time with it after the losses I’ve suffered, but I’m making things worse by engaging. But it’s hard. It’s day 4, and I’ve had a knot of anxiety in my chest all day. And this ended a year ago! God. I really do wish them the best. This is so hard. And yes, I do know logically I don’t deserve this and I’ve put myself in this position. I thankfully have a wonderful support system and have even recently started dating someone who understands what a mindfuck this has been and treats me very kindly. I just am, unfortunately, stupid.",1,1738649112.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False
1ihb5cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbaimeetups/comments/1ihb5cl/anyone_from_churchgate_and_nearby_would_like_to/,Anyone from Churchgate and nearby would like to hang out?,"So, here’s the deal—I’m a 27-year-old Mumbai guy who thrives in a world of books, flavors, and green corners. A nerd at heart, I get equally excited about deep conversations and discovering new recipes. I love cooking, not just because food is life, but because there’s something incredibly satisfying about bringing flavors together. Bonus: I make a mean cup of coffee.

I have a thing for plants—yes, I talk to them sometimes (don’t judge me, they listen better than most humans). I’m an introvert who loves cozy spaces, warm lights, and the right company. But don’t let the quiet fool you—I’ve got a sharp wit, a naughty streak, and a flirtatious side that surfaces when least expected.

What am I looking for? Someone who appreciates a good book, enjoys meaningful (or mischievous) conversations, and wouldn’t mind an impromptu dessert-making session at 2 AM. If you’re someone who can match sarcasm with sarcasm, who loves slow mornings and spontaneous adventures, we might just get along.

If you’re into deep talks, cozy corners, and a guy who can cook up both storms and laughter—slide into my DMs. Let’s see where this takes us.

anyway i mentioned to him a few days ago that i didnt really wanna continue texting nonstop bcuz it starts to make me feel a bit overwhelmed and he completely understood! but earlier the dreaded thoughts crawled their way up to my brain and kept overanalyzing how the time between texts kept getting longer and longer. in the past i havent had the best experiences w men (im very much wlw but u know...comphet) and it made me wanna RUN. yes i kinda freaked out at the fact that he respected my boundaries and randomly blocked him on everything 🧍‍♀️

idk have u ever felt so healthy compatible w someone that it scares u? we have a couple of similar interests but also have completely different aesthetics....and i dont do the whole ""staying in the present"" thing like i cannot help but think about the future i suffer from massive anxiety 🤚 i thought about it though and i decided to unblock him so i can let him know tomorrow that i will not be going forward w the weekend date instead of just disappearing...

so yea i just wanted to vent about how i will not fall into the temptations of ghosting someone i barely know 🙏🏼 and i know its a ridiculous post AND he probably wont give not one fuck 😭😭😭 BUT ITS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME!",1,1738648380.0,ghosting,1,1.0,False

1ihax3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ihax3w/how_do_i_get_over_a_girl_that_doesnt_like_me/,How do I get over a girl that doesn’t like me romantically?,"I (20m) met this girl through college. She was in all my classes last semester but we never really chatted. She did ask for my IG after one class so I did but we never really talked or anything. This semester I was in the library and she came up to my table and we chatted for maybe an hour or so. I realized this girl is really fun and easy to talk too, so I asked her to hangout in the library again after one of our classes. She said yes and we hung out a few times for like 3/4 hours, going into the evening. Since then, we haven’t really hung out like that. We’ve been casually texting (without me needing to start the convo, but lately the text backs have been longer and longer) and she has hung out with me in the library quite a few times since then, but it’s usually been for like 1 hour or 30 mins before our class. One thing I think is important to note about this girl is she is VERY extroverted and outgoing. I’ve seen her no issues make conversation with people she just met like they’ve been friends for years. I noticed she just is very attentive in conversation, even with people she doesn’t know.

I really thought her and I hit it off. We have such similar humour, music taste, opinions and tease-y sarcasm, and a bunch more. I get like lost in her eyes when we talk. She has been very flirtatious as well (and not like subtly). She asked to play truth or dare and in that game she did, however, ADMIT that she likes to very lightly flirt with guys to get them flustered, but I flirt so well back it gets her flustered. That really made my opinion change on her. But, I haven’t actually noticed her flirt with guys like she does with me. I also notice she is quite different around me than even some of her friends (more lax and jokey) and other guys. I’ve heard her do some very lightly teasing but no “flirty” type of stuff with other guys. Shes been touchy with me, saying very flirtatious and sexual stuff, etc., 

I’ve tried to make plans to hangout thrice. Once bowling, once skating, and once just for coffee. She said that she has to work each of those times, which is fair, but there has never been any effort on her side to reschedule once. 

I don’t want to play these games of “oh maybe she does like me” or “well” I want a girl that is genuinely in to me. She wants to do stuff together, she wants to hangout, and she puts in effort doing those things. I want a girl where I’m all she thinks about and she smiles when I text her. I feel like if she really liked me she would put in an effort to hangout after I’ve asked, not take forever to text me back, etc. One thing to note I guess is that she genuinely isn’t on her phone all the time. Like each time I’ve hung out with her she’s only gone on her phone maybe two or three times and when I see her with her friends it’s the same thing. 

I wonder if I just like the attention she gives me as a man that hasn’t been very popular with women and wants a relationship. I’m starting to think SHE just likes the attention I give her. The whole “I like to casually flirt with guys” has really made me kinda think differently about her and that she just likes to play dudes. Something else I’ve noticed about her is she seems a little fake. Like, for example, she’s in a group with her friend and 2 other guys that she met in class that were sitting in front of her (just worked out that way) and she’s super nice and talkative and such with them (almost like how she is with me), and then she was telling me the other day that “Omg I can’t stand those 2 guys, they’re so annoying.” Like damn, is that what you think about me?! I feel no because she has asked me to hangout with her and/or just joined me in the library without me asking her, but after she told me that I started to feel like she’s lowkey fake. Like I start to wonder if she is just hanging out with me out of pity or?? Actually, this past Friday, I was driving home from visiting a buddy an hour away so I was like fuck it, let me call her, and she answered and we ended up talking for 45 minutes and it was actually a really good time. She wasn’t rushing to get off the phone or anything. But then she didn’t text me all weekend or even talk to me today, so IDK. I don’t think she’s in to me, or even if she did, we would never work out with communication like this. I swear I noticed her look at me a few times but she didn’t try and talk or anything. 

My heart just feels so heavy. I don’t want to do anything, even go on my phone. I literally want to just lay in bed and stare at the ceiling. I have college, work, gym, cooking, etc., that I have to do and I just have zero will. I keep hoping that something with work out, but I don’t want to force anything that’s not there on her end. I want to try to cut her out because this is so mentally draining but it’s hard because she’s in all my classes. And then she bought me this little car ornament so it’s in my car but I feel bad getting rid of it cause she paid for it lmao. She also knows how I feel. In that game of truth or dare she asked me if I liked her. I said yes, and then I asked her what would the odds of me getting a date would be and she was like 85%, but I’m not “looking for a relationship right now.” I feel like that’s her trying to let me down easy or that she just isn’t wanting a relationship with ME. And then she continues to flirt with me. Is it crazy to say she’s being manipulative? And I don’t even think she realizes. I’ve noticed this actually, and it’s the main thing that’s been kind of making me become unattracted to her. It just seems so immature to me, and I feel so much more mature than people my age. She did sound hella genuine though when she said she wasn’t looking for a relationship rn because she’s just so busy with school and work that she doesn’t feel like she can fully commit to someone and she only really dates to marry someone (which is how I think). But if it was someone she really liked she would make it work, right? And am I just trying to validate my own feelings that maybe there is a chance? I feel like I’m just questioning my whole life.

Basically, how do I get over this girl that talks to me still (more in-person) and we have all the same college classes together, so I’ll be forced to see her anyway? This might be toxic, but I think I’ve decided I’m not really gonna answer her texts anymore. I friggin texted her Sunday morning, she responded, I texted back, and I still haven’t heard back. Someone that’s genuinely interested in you wouldn’t wait that long to text you back. Maybe just a bit/very limited texting. i don’t think I’ll ask her to hang out anymore either. If she just ends up joining me or maybe asks me, I’ll accept as I don’t want to be rude and keep things cordial, but I don’t think I’ll go out of my way to try and hangout with her anymore. She knows how I feel and is playing with me, I think. It’s so hard, I was already thinking like this last weekend and then she started talking with me and I totally bailed on it.

Someone that’s genuinely interested in you wouldn’t wait that long to text you back. Maybe just a bit/very limited texting. i don’t think I’ll ask her to hang out anymore either. If she just ends up joining me or maybe asks me, I’ll accept as I don’t want to be rude and keep things cordial, but I don’t think I’ll go out of my way to try and hangout with her anymore. She knows how I feel and is playing with me, I think. It’s so hard, I was already thinking like this last weekend and then she started talking with me and I totally bailed on it.

i’ve been to 3 different clinics, and the last 2 doctors told me that the bacteria levels are indeed a bit high but everything else is normal, so i had nothing to worry about. the one i saw today said every body is different so maybe it’s just the normal color for me (which it’s not— that’s the whole reason why i’m worried lol) or maybe i’m dehydrated. obviously i would know if it was dehydration over the span of 6 months. anyway, i’m pretty diligent about drinking 2L a day of water/tea, i’ve cut down on coffee and alcohol and smoking in the past few months as well. it does become clearer if i chug a bottle of water, just like it does for anyone, but even then it’s tinted a bit brownish and is cloudy.

i have no other symptoms. if 2 doctors say it’s fine, i’m thinking of letting it go, but ofc webmd says i might have liver disease. anyone who has any insight, your help is greatly appreciated. thank you!",1,1738647806.0,LiverDisease,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 1

I told no one of my questions to The Oracle or the damning prophecy it had relayed to me. Alicia knew I had gone to the cave, but much like her, my mark was hidden on my torso and wouldn't be seen by anyone I didn't want to see. As I promised not to tell anyone of her mark, she promised not to tell anyone of mine.

I was only twelve years old and I knew I was more than halfway to my death bed. That kind of pressure wasn't meant for such a young mind. It warped every thought I had; changed how I saw things.

As I stood in Alicia's bathroom, overcoming the shakes from my harsh weeping, she ran her hands through my hair and caressed my back with loving tenderness. She cooed and whispered in my ear in hopes to calm my reeling mind. I should have been excited for the closeness and the opportunity to be held by a pretty older girl.

Instead I was wondering how to meet the requirements of the ‘five coins’ that the poem had said would come from my heart. 

I don’t remember leaving Alicia’s house or what I said to her as I left. I remember telling my mom that I was going to lay down and that I didn’t want dinner. I remember laying in my messy bed, staring at the ceiling as I turned the words in my mind over and over.

Gold from innocence mislaid. 

How did one ‘mislay’ their innocence, anyway? I couldn’t come to a conclusion for that coin and moved on to the next.

Silver from a friend betrayed.

So at some point I would have to betray a friend in some meaningful way. Being without friends for so much of my life meant that I treasured the very idea of friends. The Gangers were the best friends I had ever had– even if I had only known them for less than a month. Even so, the thought of betraying any of them made me sick to my stomach. If it meant saving my life, though, maybe I could do it.

One of iron from an enemy slain.

I’d have to kill someone? That seemed impossible. How could I possibly kill someone? That’s not the type of person I would ever want to be. And who would I even consider my enemy, anyway? Maybe if someone was so terrible that I considered them my ‘enemy’ they would deserve to die. 

And two of copper from a loved one’s eyes.

What the hell did that mean? Did it mean I had to blind someone? No, that didn’t make sense. I knew I would have to research what that meant to figure out how hard it would be to get these two coins.

I tossed and turned in bed, trying to get comfortable and failing horribly. Finally, around 10pm, I gave up and climbed from my bed and headed for the kitchen, hoping that grabbing something to eat might help.

My dad was standing with his back to the sink, his hip pushed back against the sink as he ate at a jumbo honey bun. I pulled up short, surprised to see him standing there in his rugged electrician's clothes. Normally I would’ve noticed the smell of the brewing coffee before I walked up on him, but my mind was far too distracted to even notice it.

“Hey bud, what are you up to?” he asked with a raised brow. 

“I skipped dinner, so I wanted to grab a snack before I fell asleep.”

He nodded thoughtfully as if I had said something truly deep and moving, “I have truly raised a boy wise beyond his years.”

I let out a small chuckle, feeling some part of my built up tension release. “I don’t know dad, I’ve been feeling pretty dumb lately.”

“That makes you smarter than any teenager I’ve ever known.”

“What do you mean?”

“Most boys around your age think they know everything, and no amount of proof will sway them.”

“Were you like that?”

“Doubly so, yeah.” He threw away the wrapper and started to fill his thermos with the fresh coffee. “How have you been enjoying the neighborhood? Mom says you are out of the house every moment she doesn’t force you to be inside.”

I nodded slightly and leaned against the oven opposite him, “Yeah, I’ve made some pretty cool friends.”

I described each of them and talked about them a little, my dad listening intently as I gushed about how great my friends were. Alicia was the last one I spoke about, and my dad took special interest in her.

“Huh, I should’ve figured.”

“What do you mean?”

My dad let out a mighty sigh and sat his massive hand on my shoulder, “Listen, you be good to that girl. I can tell by the way you talk about her, she’s good to you.”

I wanted to protest, but then realized that I had spoken about her for twice as long as anyone else.

“I gotta get to work, bud. I’m off the night after tomorrow, so how about I get up a bit early and we go to that drive-thru down the highway and watch something?”

I smiled. I hadn’t gotten to spend hardly any time with my dad since he started his new job as an electrician for the power company, doing dangerous maintenance on the power grid at night. Even though the work was straining and posed a real risk to him, he enjoyed it immensely and it paid well. Unfortunately, it meant he slept all day and worked all night, leaving little time for Mom and me.

He wrapped me in a hug, kissed the top of my head, and tousled my hair. He grabbed up his thermos and went out to his work truck, the dark swallowing him whole before the metallic beast lit up the driveway. As he pulled out of the drive, I waved just in case he could see him. I watched him drive away, munching on one of his honey buns.



# Chapter 2

There were many small things that happened the rest of that summer before school started up. I couldn’t focus on much and found little enjoyment in the adventures the Cavers drug me through. I knew Alicia hadn’t told them about my foolish actions, but they could all tell something was wrong with me. To their credit, they all did their best to cheer me up in their own ways. 

Nothing helped though.

My first four weeks at Upperpoint High School came and went. 

I had found a groove to fit into, and even had a period with Theo and a different one with Shannon. Unfortunately, none of the Cavers from my neighborhood shared my lunch period, so I spent the time at a table with a handful of kids from my classes. 

One was a Caver named Steven that Theo introduced me to during our shared P.E. class. He lived in the rich neighborhood that I had heard about from Theo. The one that Aiden lived in.

“I heard you guys had to scratch someone’s name from The Rock,” I prompted as I poked at my rubbery pizza.

“Oh, Aiden?” Steven shrugged a bit and nodded. “Yeah, dudes an asshole. Jordan said he was breaking the oaths by spreading a rumor about a girl from your group right?”

“Yeah, some pretty bad stuff,” I agreed and pushed my tray away.

“‘Pretty bad’? Jesus, underselling much Will?” Jen asked with a dubious gesture. “Aiden said she had a gangbang with five highschoolers when she was in the eighth.”

“What’s a gangbang?” Joel asked with a confused look at us. He was only 10 but got moved up two grades because he passed some tests.

“It’s when a bunch of dudes all get together with one girl and-” Clark started before receiving a sharp elbow from Jen. “Oww! What the fuck Jen?”

“Ask your older brother about it when you get home Joel,” Jen said as she threw a dangerous glare toward Clark. “Yeah, Shannon got bullied pretty bad the rest of last year. She seemed to handle it really well though.”

My blood was boiling at the mention of what he had really said. It seemed like Jen admired Shannon’s ability to handle the verbal abuse she had suffered from her peers.

The next day, during my second period, an unfamiliar teacher rushed into our classroom and whispered something to our teacher. She turned on the monitor in the corner of the room, and my class watched in shock as the second plane hit the World Trade Center.

I don’t remember much about the rest of that school day now, but we got sent home early and after talking to my mom for a few minutes, I went over to Alicia’s and watched the news on her big screen with the rest of the Cavers. None of us knew what was going on at the time, but the event left us all in a weird mood, and we went our separate ways as our parents got home from work. 

I was the last one to leave her house, and before I did, I asked her if she could just hold me for a few minutes. 

She obliged the simple request and I held her back, smelling her conditioner as the news in the background went on about their theories of who did the attack. When I pulled away, she looked down and gave me a weak smile.

Looking back on it, I knew she could tell I was hurt, and all she wanted was to fix the pain. Unfortunately, The Oracle had planted the pain so deep, that no one was ever going to pull it free.",2,1738647705.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False

I started getting weird symptoms where I felt like I could not digest no matter what I do, and it won’t go away. I tried eating at 4pm but still would go to bed with it and wake up with it. I almost got depressed and started eating much less to not feel like that 

i went to the doctor after a week or two, and got h-pylori positive, did 2 week antibiotics, and eradicated it. during this process, I stopped drinking coffee and alcohol completely and some other food doc told me to avoid like tomatoes. after the treatment, I hadn’t had symptoms for over three months

a couple weeks ago, I started drinking coffee again in the morning because I have been having one or two per week at cafes and never had an issue. not even a week later, i start getting my symptoms again. But the trigger is not just any coffee, it’s CAFE BUSTELO! 

I had Breville and drank espresso with whole beans for years with no issue until i moved to pennsylvania last september, because my roommate took the machine. I started drinking coffee in my Mokapot, and because east coast has Aldi, I naturally bought CAFE BUSTELO and drank it as my main coffee. I drank two weeks of Breville espressos when my friend brought the machine to my house while visiting in december and had no issue. The second I start drinking Mokapot, CAFE BUSTELO, this january, I got symptoms again. 

I stopped drinking it once I realized it might be the trigger and now the symptoms are completely gone in less than a week. During this week, I still drank latte and drip coffee at a coffee shop, so I am 99% certain it’s CAFE BUSTELO specific symptoms.

After looking into both the creatista and latissima machines, outside of the fact they both have milk frothers, I'm trying to figure out what justifies the massive price increase from the next. Are they built better? I've heard some of the vertuo machines have been having mechanical issues? Does it brew a strictly better tasting cup of coffee? What is the overall advantage? Their website is not particularly clear in my opinion. 

Also, I notice these machines have a milk reservoir. Does this mean they automatically heat up and portion the correct amount of milk into the cup for a cappuccino?

We see why his death took such a toll on Kate, and it was because of how much he went out of his way to be a good dad to her. Speaking of Kate, she is on her way to a weight loss camp, and she has an eye for a guy at this camp. This episode talks a lot about their birthday in the past timeline. We see footage of their birthday parties up until their 10th, when they explain they each want their own birthday parties. Kevin wants to flex his acting skills, by reciting the Inigo Montoya scene a thousand times, with a Princess Bride themed party. Kate wants to have a Madonna themed party, so she can teach her friends to vogue. Randall isn't fully convinced yet, until he learns he can have a magician for his birthday party.

Jack wants to have another child, but Rebecca vetoes it, because she wasn't prepared to be a mother of 3, and she's already exhausted trying to keep up with Kevin, Kate and Randall. Back to the parties, they are decorated to the tee on the themes the kids want for their birthday parties. Kevin ended up having 99 percent of the guests, as Kate's guests ditch her party, to go to Kevin's party, and Randall only has 3 people show up. Rebecca is very unhappy about the lack of guests for Randall, and she wonders if it is because of his race. Randall reassures her he would much rather spend it with the three people that did show up, and that he's not lonely at school. Now Rebecca wants to have kids, but Jack doesn't.

He sees Kate abandoned at her party, so he went out of his way to learn how to vogue, for her. She's still upset about all of her guests abandoning her to go to Kevin's party, including her best friend Sophie, who has a crush on Kevin. The day ended with a wrapping paper fight, playing their old game, Pin the tail on the donkey,  and bringing out the original sign that signified their birthdays past with Jack. Eventually, we see a glimpse of Rebecca, Kevin, Kate, and Randall at Jack's funeral service. The kids appear to be in their late teens, so we know it is going to happen soon. Make sure you all prepare for this emotional, gut-wrenching, and heart breaking moment in the show.

Kate sees Toby go through heart surgery, and decided not to have gastric bypass surgery after all, so instead, she ends up at a weight loss camp. He is supportive about it, and drops her off at the remote Adirondacks locale. Kate then finds out that this fat camp is all about yoga, and serenity, and tackling the issues that lay beneath the weight, and not the weight itself. Kate doesn't like it, so during the drumstick-slinging session, she calls Toby to come get her. While she is on the phone, the resident horse whisperer Duke, taunts her into putting the phone away. He explains that people don't change, and that is why she is quitting. Kate decides not to quit, and it becomes therapeutic for her. As she conjures up mental images of Jack, and all he did for her, she screamed in pain. 

She then thanks Duke for being a dick, to convince her to stay, but that was not his intention. Now he has feelings for her. She rejects him, because she is engaged, but Duke still thinks it is going to happen. While Kate is at her camp, Toby decides to hang out with Kevin. He keeps thinking about who he wants to try again with Sloane, or Olivia, but Toby gives him advice, to treat women right. He tells Kevin to close his eyes and picture his true love, and it ended up being Sophie. It is then revealed that they were once married, but have been divorced for twelve years, due to something Kevin did. He shows up at her home, and gives some speech, like every other Pearson man. She agreed to meet him for coffee. We will see what happens.

Randall and Beth warned William that his presence was going to earn him top billing in Randall's life, so when he wakes up feeling good for the first time in months, he decides to keep Randall out of the office for a day, to spend time with William. Randall and William ended up spending the day together, going shopping, scouring town for the perfect egg-cream shake, whatever that is. Eventually, he reveals he never learned how to drive, so Randall changes that. He knows what it is like to lose a parent, so he makes the most out of this time with William,

I was only a barista at a coffee shop right out of undergraduate, but I worked there for about 8 months. I have been dealing with post-grad mental health issues, mostly depression and anxiety which takes the form of irritability, especially in stressful situations. My boss has told me two times during one on one meetings that I am too emotional at work and need to leave my feelings at the door in order to be more pleasant towards customers. I did everything I could and I thought I was doing a good job. I would make fake small talk, smile and try my best to not let the emotions of others shift my mood at work. However I found that my coworkers were all good friends without me which made my mood worse, they would purposefully give me the shit tasks because they didn't like me but they were nice to my face. They would disclude me when they ordered lunch and didn't frequently involve me in conversations. The managers told me technical things that I could do better, and they made checklists to make sure every task was always done, yet they never told me that I was doing a good job, they only ever talked to me when I did something they didn't like. I wasn't always in a good mood, I frequently was grumpy because I was being disrespected by my coworkers and my bosses. When I got fired I sent out an apology text that pretty much said I was sorry to my coworkers and that I was fired for being moody and that the managers didn't like me and for my managers to go to hell. How do I move forward here and be a better person? Everything people disliked about me came from my depression and other aspects of me they didn't care to get to know. I just sometimes can't relate to people and I have a hard time faking happiness like everyone else. I don't have many friends because its hard not to see myself as mean or as a bad person.

Basically, I got coffee with an old coworker because she asked me to. I went, it was nice to catch up, and we started talking about the old business we both used to work for. We always used to get along. 

I currently work for one of our old mutual coworkers, and I am frustrated with my position as I feel I do everything for her with very little compensation. I expressed my frustrations to my old coworker, considering these two had worked together at one point for many years and just wanted to feel vindicated in how I was feeling. If anyone would know, it would be her. 

Fast forward to the end of our meetup, and she expresses that she recorded our conversation and will send it to my boss if I don’t leave and come work for her. 

Is this illegal? I’m panicking as I obviously don’t want this sent to my boss, all I wanted was to confide in someone who I thought would understand. I believe this is considered blackmail but i’m unsure if I reported her to police if anything could be done since it isn’t related to money or any kind of exchange of goods.

----------------------------------------

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/vYfJCEWeaM): **August 18, 2024**

My father has always been against any confrontation or arguments. He is extremely passive, refuses to stand up for himself, and avoids any conflict. If someone isn't paying attention while walking and bumps into him, he insist it's his own fault. If his employer would mess up his salary, he wouldn't bother fixing it. If a mechanic didn't properly repair his car, he would just accept it as is.

This unfortunately resulted in a tumultuous childhood with my insanely narcissistic mother. She controlled his every move. She got him to quit his job and be a locked in stay at home dad. She had him do every chore. She insulted him at every step. She cheated on him relentlessly and even brought APs into our home. She enjoyed making his life miserable every day and he never questioned it. My extended family, God bless them, were there for me so many times as much as they could be. They tried for years to make my father leave but he never budged.

When she would direct her anger onto myself, in the form of screaming, insulting or general demeaning, my father never once found the guts to stand up for me or support me. When I was a kid if I cried to dad about something mom did or said to me he would sweep it under the rug or just insist I forget about it. Hell he would even try and justify it.

As I grew older it really set in for me how messed up this was. My mother gladly kicked me out of the house when I was 18 and my father just sat there and looked sullen. Didn't say a damn thing. I joined the Air Force almost immediately and got stationed on the other side of the country. The dynamic was awful and I could have easily gone down the incel route if not for therapy and the amazing people I met along the way.

It took years for me to get in a better mental space. I was filled with hatred. My mother left my father 2 years after I got stationed and utterly destroyed my father in the divorce. She was killed a year later in a DUI with one of her APs. I took alot of joy in hearing that it took her hours to die, and that's when I really knew I needed help to process things. I'm almost 30 now, have a girlfriend who is perhaps the best thing to ever happen in my life, and fully understands the situation with my family. I have learned to not allow myself to be consumed with anger and resentment by my past (or so I thought, you'll see) and instead put that energy to my future.

I have been extraordinarily low contact/ near no contact with my father since I left. As much as I try, I cannot make that connection with him. I recently went to a family reunion and brought my girlfriend with me. My father was there as it was his side of the family. They have many issues with him but he is family so whatever I guess. I made sure to avoid him.

I was chatting with my uncles when I heard my father talk in the background. He was discussing how a coworker of his was going through a divorce as he discovered his wife was having an affair, and was positioned to have a very favorable divorce on his side. My father remarked how his coworker should work instead to forgive his wife and by his own words ""set a good example for unity and forgiveness"", and how he believed he set a great example for me in that extent.

I swear it was like a switch went off in my head and I was mentally back to being the rage filled 18 year old. All these years and he never learned a damn thing. I turned to him and asked if he was fucking serious. He looked at me and started to stutter. I know the next minute was pure word vomit and I can't relay it perfectly, but to sum it up I shouted how he was a pathetic father, pathetic man, his family all know he's a disgrace of a human being who would rather his son be treated like shit then defend him because he's a fucking coward, no one would ever see him as an example to live by, his wife would rather fuck half the neighborhood then even touch him, and he should never EVER believe anyone respects him

I began to derail and ramble between my shouting and my girlfriend quickly took me out and drove me home. It was insane just how quickly being away from him made me feel better. She just held me when we got back and told me it's OK. Again, best thing to ever happen to me. I was ashamed of how I lost It and am now going to resume my therapy, that's a given. However, I'm glad I finally unloaded ehay always needed to be said onto him

Extended family is pretty mixed with reactions. His brothers/my uncles said it was time for him to hear it from me, my grandparents are pissed I did that in front of the entire extended family, with some saying I should have done that behind closed doors instead of everyone.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA with a few YTAs**

**Relevant Comments**

**Mesmerizing-Taylor:** It sounds like you finally got to express the pent-up feelings you've carried for so long. While the outburst wasn't ideal, it seems like it was a necessary step towards healing. It's good you're resuming therapy to process this further.

> **OOP:** Yeah afterwords it hit me that although it was very cathartic, It definitely wasn't the most appropriate way to handle it lol

**nevertoomuchthought:** He sounds like a gentle, kind, and well-meaning person. You directed what is very clearly anger and resentment for your mother at him. It's a bit more complicated than being an asshole or not. You seem to have got some catharsis out of it I just don't believe he is the one you really wanted to scream at and from the sounds of it he was also a victim of your mother too. And while he was the adult and should have known better he obviously didn't. Being nonconfrontational isn't some character flaw. It's psychological. And he probably needs therapy himself. Screaming at him and demeaning him actually sounds like something your mother probably did/would do and I worry about you if that is something that actually made you feel better about yourself.

> **OOP:** Yes I fully admit he was a victim of my mother, but he was a victim who had a support system he never wanted to use, he fully let me be a victim my entire childhood because apparently it was too much effort to try, and to this day doesn't believe he needs therapy

**nevertoomuchthought:** All I can say is based on your post and this interaction is your anger is deeply misguided. And you're failing to recognize the truly horrifying thing. You're behaving like the mother you actually should hate.

> **OOP:** Oh trust me I fully hate her as well, but she is gone, and there is no use in holding a grudge against a dead person. I had hoped though, after his son making him an outsider in his life, his family openly joking face to face about his failings as a father, and his ex wife draining him for everything he had and making him start over in a one bedroom apartment, his friends slowly leaving his life one at a time out of embarrassment, that he would have maybe have at least one moment to reflect and maybe consider he should have done things differently

**OOP getting therapy due to his past trauma**

> **OOP:** Eh yeah either way I need to hop back on the horse for therapy. It'll be good for me. As for my grandparents, I really have had to look back as to how far this pattern of enabling goes back. I know they all did what they could to try and help, but it always seemed like there were times that more active measures could be taken. Times where people should have been far more stern with his addressing his behavior. The older generation on his side are the classical "" they're fanily and we stick together no matter what"" and I have to think whether his passivenes and enabling is something he picked up on his own or something he learned from his own parents

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/tg27i6waXI): **August 20, 2024 (two days later)**

Thanks for the advice and recommendations, even amongst some of the YTA. However, some of them needed to he addressed because they were either hilarious or cringe worthy

1) Some of them were very angry, and they kind of confused me at first until I saw their comments further down or saw their profile and saw rants about double standards or complete non sequitur ramblings about women. So yeah, not helpful advice and they were great dark reflections about how I could have turned out if not for the support in my life

2) Some attempted to portray my dad as a humble, kind, caring sensitive old man who I'm just being a big bully to. This was a very good insight into how enablers of abuse get away with so much in todays worls, because so many people forget how they are part of the abuse themselves

3) Some were attempting to mentally dissect me or have a gotcha moment with me to pull apart my story. That was generally asinine and I had to step away from those before they asked for my cranial measurements or something

So it was pretty much immediately when I was up the next morning that I realized I needed to resolve the events of last night. I first spoke to my girlfriend and gave a sincere apology for having her see me like that. She reassured me that nothing was wrong, she'd known me for years and has always known me to be level headed, and understands why I kinda snapped. She herself has a history of dealing with narcissistic family so she absolutely understands the dynamic. She only really told me that it would be best to work on spending time around my extended family since my father will always be there. I told her don't worry, I'm immediately going to talk to them afterwords to figure that out. So that parts fine. Looked like kind of an ass in front of her, but I'm making sure that doesn't happen again. I also informed of her my intentions to resume more therapy just to keep myself steady which she was happy to hear.

I called my grandparents and sincerely apologized as well for putting such a sore dent into their family reunion. That it wasn't appropriate and while I still feel it felt good to say that to him, it should have been privately and not in front of everyone. I also told then that going forward, as much as I love spending time with them, since the family always hangs out in one group that my father will always be in, for now until I can handle being around him, I need to distance myself occasionally until I feel comfortable interacting. I told them that I am nor would I ever be establishing an ultimatum or demands of them, and that either way I need to step back

I guess during my apology and explanation I was kind of just going on a tangent because my grandfather interrupted me to calm down. He told me that after I left, people kind of separated or slowly started leaving, and they eventually were able to talk to my father one on one. I guess seeing me have such a freak out resulted in my grandmother having a mini freak out of her own when she started talking to my father, resulting in her kicking him out. While I have a great relationship with both, my grandmother has always been extra protective of me so seeing me that way must have set off a fire in her. 

My grandfather then said that it has become a bit of an open family secret my father's failing. His brothers taunt him about it and generally don't have a great relationship with him, and for my grandparents it's always just uneasy. But seeing me the other day and how it still affects me so much has really liked in for a lot of people that it was really bad. They began to try and say sorry if they didn't do enough, which I very adamantly retorted that they did more than what anyone could have expected. 

It was very emotional for a minute, but culminated in then telling me that they have decided to distance themselves from my father for the time being, and have given him the ultimatum that unless he has a deep introspective and regularly goes to therapy, that distance may become permanent. My extended family I've been told, are going to try and reach out or call or whatever, but I asked them if they could relay to them that it's not necessary, and that I'm fine and am sorry to them as well for ruining the day, which again, they told me I shouldn't apologize for being hurt. Since then extended family have sent some messages with the general consensus that it's OK with some older members complaining about my lack of respect towards my father

And finally, I texted my father hoping to meet at a local coffee shop and have a final talk. I met him and he didn't look good. I think his parents tearing into him finally got the message through. I had so may things I could have said, but I instead asked him first thing if the coworker he gave the advice to took it well. He just said that neither him nor several coworkers interact with him anymore. I asked him if he truly 100% believes that every single thing he did for me as a child was for MY benefit. He didn't really say anything. I then finally asked if he has any regrets for how I was treated as a child, and if he thinks he ever did anything wrong. He looked utterly defeated and just mumbled that he could have done more. I could have poked and prodded and could have gone on another rant, but instead I told him this should be goodbye and I hope he gets the help he needs

I think finally unloading my frustrations was what I needed to finally be able to move on and find peace. I absolutely need to keep on track for therapy and admit that a public bitching moment isn't OK, but I should be fine

**Comments**

**atmasabr:** This is an interesting one.

The ability to control one's failures (yes that's what I'll call your situation) is very powerful. You'll do all right.

**I_wanna_be_anemone:** Congratulations sincerely on owning your actions. No matter how justified, you acknowledged your outburst was uncomfortable for others and likely not appropriate in that setting. It takes incredible strength of character to admit your failings even if you have no idea how else you could have reacted in that moment. 

That you immediately communicated that to your loved ones is a huge sign of how respectable and genuine you are as a person, I really hope you keep moving forward from this situation with the same mindset. Good luck. 

**jessicaa_fit:** NTA. It sounds like you handled things well after what happened. You took responsibility by apologizing to your girlfriend and family, and it's clear you’re committed to moving forward by focusing on therapy and healing. It’s understandable that you snapped given everything you’ve been through. It’s also clear that your outburst made your family realize the impact your dad’s behavior had on you.

Don’t beat yourself up over it. You’ve done what you needed to do to move on, and it seems like you’re on the right track now.

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/iblNXhW7sT): **September 12, 2024 (three weeks later)**

Things have progressed over the last couple weeks and I now have broader context about my family

Long sorry short is, there was alot hidden from me, my father was an absolute asshole to his family, and that's why the treat him the way they do

I got alot of feedback including the compilation posts on BestOfRedditorUpdates and BORU, and one thing that stood out was people questioning if my extended family could have contributed to the abuse and that's why he was so feeble. And since I was trying to work on my relationship with my family, I figured it was tike to ask the hard questions before going that far

I met with my dad's brothers who invites me out to a popular lunch spot. For context and clarity:

-Dale is the oldest brother. He is married and has a daughter and a son

-My father is the second oldest. Self explanatory

-John is the second youngest, also married with a son

-Bill is the youngest, married with 3 daughters

So anyways, we met up and I ripped the bandaid off asking about my father growing up, what he was like beyond the basics I know, and what really is going on with their relationship

Dale sighed and bascially summed up that besides what I know, there is alot of backstory I'm unfamiliar with that they never told me about simply because it was never the tike nor the place to. What I've always known is that my father was fairly normal when he was young, a little shy but fantastic academically, played sports occasionally, had a close knit relationship with his brothers, and meeting my mom in high school junior year made everything go downhill

What I didn't know was that my father was a guiding figure for his 2 younger brothers, was generally seen as one of the nicest people, with a bright future ahead of him. My grandparents adored him and he even became a little bit of a golden child but no one minded. The reason his family doesn't respect him is what happened to his behavior when my mother got attached to him

-it first started simple, my mother acted rude and distant to the family. They weren't huge fans but my father loved her so they tolerated it

-she became possessive and slowly isolated my father and convinced him to give up his ambitions and goals. family became concerned and spent a long time trying to talk to him and convince him to leave. My father didn't budge and began to lash out.

-when I was born my extended family tried to talk to my father about my mother's attitude. My father was angry and threatened to report them for harassment. He was in denial about her behavior

-when Dale's wife was having fertility issues, my mother messaged her appalling and cruel things. When Dale was pissed and went to talk to my father, he told Dale to drop it and even justified it. Dale punched him and police almost got involved. Dale hated him going forwards

-John grew to hate him when my mother insulted his son due to mild physical disabilities. My father cracked a joke about what she said. John hated him then

-Finally Bill, who always idolized my father, tried to inform my father that my mother made a pass at him and urged divorce. My father responded with a maddening call of utter hate and relationship ending words

To sum it all up, the more time my father spent with my mother, the more he began to repeat her attitude. When they all signs of abuse to me and tried to intervene, my father threatened to lie, to accuse them of worse things. My mother had money and lawyers and could make their lives hell if they tried and my father would gladly let her. They were stuck and could only do so much at a time

The older members of the family like the grandparents, great and and uncles and such, believe in the traditional mindset of family sticking together no matter what, while the generations further down want to keep a distance from him. They're all stuck between and rock and a hard place

There's more they told me out it was all essentially that my father died on the hill for my mom, ruining his relationship with his brothers in the process. And when she died and destroyed him, he probably had to realize it was all for nothing. My grandparents seem to not want to accept the fact that he was lost, or maybe they hope he can fix his life. Who knows.

This was a lot to process and was only confirmed by my father himself when he called my to ask about family therapy with us. I cur to the chase and asked if what I heard was true. He said yes.

I would have agreed to maybe some family therapy but now I have no idea

&nbsp;

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/40U4Q8o3A7): **September 25, 2024 (13 days later)**

I came to the decision that it was time to cut off my father for good. The more I learned about how he was the more I came to the realization that nothing good would come out of having him in my life. I'm also going to put some minor distance between myself and extended family on his side until I can process things more. There's just alot of things to work through there

I met up with my father one last time in a coffee shop to talk things over. I asked him one last time, why? Why did he do all this? Why did he let his wife treat everyone like shit? Why did HE treat his family and me like shit for her? Why did he do all this? He tried to weasle his way out but I absolutely demanded to know

And he bascially answered that it was because he loved her. Yep, it was that stupid of an answer. He loved her and just clung onto her no matter what she did. No matter how much she hurt him or others he was an insecure man who just latched himself on the first woman who showed him attention. Even when she slowly destroyed his life he thought it was better than trying again

I just got up and told him to fix his life but I won't be a part of it, and I hope he has the sense to understand why. No matter how he tried to word it, i had 2 abusive parents. He didn't say anything. Just stared at me.

Which leads to last night. I got a call from my grandparents that the night before my dad tried to call his brothers and make peace. Unfortunately from what they said, he did it in the most half assed avoidant way possible sparing himself any guilt. That didn't go well. After recent events and old wounds being dug up, they gave him a verbal lashing that made mine look microscopic in comparison.

My dad hung up and lost his shit. Decimated his entire apartment before packing up what was left before driving off. They only found out because one of the brothers came to check up on him. From what they can tell from the few texts they have, he's lost his mind after decades of shit and is driving off to the other side of the country to start fresh

Also, from the minimum communication they have with him, he's acting incredibly vile towards them, and they say he seems to be acting just like my mother

**EDIT:** Things are progressing/spiraling very quickly and I'm expecting this whole insanity parade to come to a conclusion within a few days at this rate. Won't make any real update until I have all the facts but I'm just glad I made the decision to move on

&nbsp;

-----------------------

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Life has moved on](https://www.reddit.com/u/Artistic-Minute-4365/s/yjfFxpxZM6): **January 9, 2025 (3.5 months later)**

For those who stuck around I'd say it's over and about as wrapped up as can be

My girlfriend/fiancee and I are getting married later this year.

My father is alive. He lost his shit and spiraled but a couple weeks later came back. His apartment obviously barred him from coming back and are going after him for legal and financial damages. He has no job anymore. He is staying with my grandparents. He has hit the absolute lowest point and has finally taken responsibility for his life, his choices, and his damaged relationships. It's too late for alot of the family, but his parents are seemingly giving some help since he's finally trying to fix things

However, the extended family as a whole has kind of blown up. My father kind of became a mascot for deeper family issues that have become worse over time. There are far too many to go over. When he finally got called out, everyone figured there was no use in ignoring everything else going on. Minor feuds have formed, some people aren't talking to eachother. Some have entered marriage counseling and family therapy. People don't want to live by the ""but faaaamily"" lifestyle anymore.

My fiancee and I have decided to distance ourselves. We were kind of disappointed seeing how since her family is insanely toxic we could lean on mine, but I've come to realize mine has far too many issues to be reliable. We have a fantastic group of friends so we will be fine.

And that's about it. I'm gonna be wrapping this up and moving on to a far less bitter lifestyle. I'll stick around for a little longer to elaborate on anything if anyone wants

And please do not post this on social media.

Pardon me, as this may be laid down a bit messy.
So, I’ve been dating this guy for like 2 weeks now. He’s currently on a bar review as I said on the title. During our talking stage, he could afford to respond to my messages after 2 to 3 hours, which was totally fine with me given that he’s on bar review everyday. We met on Bumble btw, but we had a few dates na in person, i.e coffee, ice cream, and movie date. I’ve been to his place and met his sister. So last weekend he needed to catch up on his readings, which I think took a day, though he made mention na he wasn’t able to finish it nga. He sets schedule with his deadlines, and because he was not able to finish it last Saturday, so he needed to do a lot of readings Sunday. We converse naman, and I also update him with my day, but up until today, he wasn’t very much interested to chat/have a message with me. Though, I called him last night, because I was wondering why his responses were more than 5 hours late, compare to when we’re still in our talking stage, that he could afford to respond to me even after 2 to 3 hrs. This sounds funny and weird prolly but I’ve been anxious since yesterday. I felt like he lost interest in me or maybe he’s just really pre-occupied(?). Last night, he told me that he would be running errands today for his mom, which means he’s not on review, but he hasn’t texted/responded to me even when I texted him first in the morning.

I’m sharing because I want to understand him. Like what must I do now? I’m kinda going gaga. It would be great if I receive advices from anyone here, given that you know better in terms of law students/graduates perspective.

But I think what has been most devastating is realizing I'm too scared to do things I want. There is a musical touring, and an Orchestra concert that sounds amazing going on in the city where the abuse took place. But I'm too scared. I'm scared of running into anyone from the church involved in my abuse. I missed a volenteer opportunity because I was so scared of seeing someone from that church I was just sobbing uncontrollably.

But I also am handicapped in the small town I moved back to where I grew up. I went to a coffee shop (my favorite space in this small town I moved to) and overheard someone talk about a sermon, and almost threw up. Had to leave before I got my coffee. Was shaken up the next time I walked in. There are churches on about every corner. Even seeing a stupid coffee maker can be a trigger. 

My little town is also super religious. So is my family. So are all the old friends I have. Honestly, so are the reasons for living I had and morals and values and purpose I felt. 

I feel my world getting smaller and smaller, and I just feel like less of a person now. I feel small and not valuable. I feel pathetic. I don't know the right words. 

I have a therapist, but honestly once a week is barely enough. I have a few friends I can talk to, but I think I have exhausted them, and I don't want to hurt them more. I'm also just not a good friend right now. 

I just wish I could shrivel up as small as I feel. I hardly feel like a real person anymore. Just a pathetic shell of who I used to be. 

If you want to hate on me, weirdly I welcome it. I hate on myself, lol. It's be nice to have some validation in that hate. I just want to get smaller and smaller in hopes that no one sees me anymore.

Now, I’m ready for my next big adventure: building a future with the right person—marriage, family, and all the moments in between.

I don’t smoke or do drugs, but I do appreciate strong coffee, a well-earned drink, and an active lifestyle. My downtime is anything but dull—you’ll find me scuba diving, cooking, riding motorcycles, boating, or tackling DIY projects. Family means everything to me, and I believe in living a healthy, fulfilling life.

I’m looking for someone who’s kind, emotionally steady, and ready for something real.

It's difficult to know where to begin—stories like this are often dismissed, reduced to little more than a tale. 

Something so bizarre, so outlandish, is always seen as just a story, a fiction, a cautionary myth designed to scare children into staying indoors after dark or to eat their vegetables. 

But this... this is no myth. As painful as it is to dredge up these memories, to share something so desply unsettling, it needs to be said. It needs to be told.. 

Not that anyone will believe me—people never do. But I swear, it's real. Every part of it.

The sweltering heat of early July clung to the asphalt as my wife and I pulled out of Pennsylvania, the hum of the highway beneath us a familiar melody of change. 

The road stretched ahead, winding down toward East Tennessee, where my family waited, where home was supposed to feel like home. But at that point, home was just a word—a temporary stop between the endless cycle of leaving and returning.

We weren’t a military family, just two young dumb 20 year olds, not bound by duty to roam from state to state at the government’s command. 

No, our travels were dictated by something far less noble, something far more relentless. 

A vicious cycle of scraping by, of watching our bank account drain faster than we could fill it, of packing up our lives and starting over—again and again. Pennsylvania to Tennessee, Tennessee to Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania to Tennessee, a pendulum swinging on the weight of desperation.

Thankfully this time it WAS just a visit.  No packing up our lives, no uprooting again—just a trip to see family. 

But God, if I wasn’t tired of this drive. Eight-plus hours of highway, a journey I had made so many times it felt burned into my muscle memory. I’d done it at least a dozen times already, back and forth, the same stretches of asphalt, the same endless miles of road signs and gas stations.

And that’s where this story truly begins.
Cowans Gap.

A beautiful state park nestled near the Pennsylvania border. If you take Interstate 81 North, you pick it up in Tennessee, ride it through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, then finally, Pennsylvania. 

And the moment you cross that final state line, it almost immediately spits you into what I can only describe as absolutely fucking nowhere. “The Boonies” we like to call it. 

Nothing but endless trees, rolling hills, and the kind of backcountry that makes you wonder if you’re still in the 21st century.

But not too long after you enter Pennsylvania, you pass through Cowans Gap. And yes, I said beautiful. But beauty doesn’t always mean comfort.
Something about that place always felt... off.

Especially at night.

I’ve driven through it more times than I can count, and each time, that eerie feeling settles in. That quiet, creeping sensation that you’re not alone, that something is just beyond your line of sight, just out of reach. Watching.
Always watching.

And no matter how many times I make that drive, that feeling never fades.
In fact, it seems worse each time.

I’ve driven through plenty of creepy state parks in my life. Comes with the territory of my job. As an electrician, I’m constantly bouncing between three different states a week, crisscrossing highways and backroads, passing through the kind of places where the trees seem to whisper and the night presses in a little too close. 

I’ve seen my fair share of eerie spots—places like Brown Mountain, where I grew up hearing stories about the strange lights that drift through the trees like glowing specters, lost souls searching for something they’ll never find.

But Cowans Gap?
This was different.

This wasn’t some old ghost story passed around campfires. This felt real.
Each time I drove through it, the air felt heavier, the silence deeper, like the trees themselves were holding their breath. The road twisted and turned through the darkness, my yellow high beams carving through the thick woods. And every time, I caught myself glancing at the trees, half-expecting to see something—someone—standing there.

Waiting.

Like a face just barely visible behind the bark, something wrong in its shape, something grinning, teasing, just out of reach.
Like it was waiting for my car to break down.

Like it knew, one day, I wouldn’t be leaving that mountain road.
Let me not get too sidetracked, though. It’s just… when I think of that place, I get tangled up in the memories. Those goddamned memories.

We had just left Tennessee. We’d gone down to celebrate the Fourth of July with my family, a short-lived break from the grind, a chance to breathe. My folks live in an old house in the Tri-Cities, tucked on a quiet road off the highway where time seems to move just a little slower. 

Every year, the church across the street puts on a firework spectacle that could rival a city show. Awe-inspiring, the kind of display that makes your chest swell when the sky bursts into fire and color.
I wasn’t a big fan of the church itself, though. 

My wife and I had gone a few Sundays, trying to find something more in our lives, a connection, a purpose. At the time, we felt like we needed it. But nothing quite says ""Christ-loving church"" like the stench of racism and homophobia they spewed from the pulpit. 

It only took a few visits to realize that this wasn’t the place for us. If we were going to give up our one guaranteed day off together, it wasn’t going to be for that.
So we packed up our things that night, ready to hit the road.

Our ride? A maroon-colored Chevy G20, one of those old conversion vans with the raised roof, perfect for camping, road-tripping, or just getting lost for a while. We called her Barbra. 

She was our pride and joy, a cool little beast with side pipes that made her roar down the highway like she owned it. And loud—so loud she turned heads every time we fired her up. But more than anything, she was reliable.

That Chevy 350 small block could take us to Mars and back without a hiccup.
And thank God for that.
Because the last place I’d ever want to break down was Cowans Gap.

And, of course, that’s all I could think about the whole way back to Pennsylvania—Cowans Gap.

Barbra was a beast, no doubt about that. But she had her quirks. And by quirks, I mean her gas gauge didn’t work.
That never really bothered me, though. I knew the right places to stop and exactly when to stop. 

I’d only done this drive more times than I wished I had, after all.
The first stop was always over halfway through in Woodstock, Virginia. There’s a Sheetz there—one of my favorites, right up there with Wawa. 

Every time, without fail, I ordered the same thing: a double-patty burger smothered in buffalo sauce, a side of fries, and an extra cup of buffalo sauce to dunk them in. A ritual at this point, something familiar in the middle of these long, restless drives.

Then, there was the second stop—right at the Pennsylvania border. Another Sheetz. But by then, I didn’t need food. What I needed was liquid courage.
No, not alcohol. Coffee.

Something to keep my eyes open, to keep my mind from wandering too far into the shadows stretching alongside the road. Because after that stop, there’s nothing but Amish fields for miles. Just dark, empty farmland with towering cornfields swaying in the night breeze—cornfields that look straight out of Children of the Corn, endless rows that could hide anything, or anyone.

And then, past that, there’s Cowans Gap.
No gas stations. No streetlights. Just a long, winding road through the deep, black woods.

And if you run out of gas there?
Well… let’s just say breaking down in the middle of those fields or on that lonely mountain road isn’t an option.
Not with whatever’s waiting in the trees.

Chapter 2: Lights in the Distance

The night stretched long and restless, the hum of Barbra’s engine the only steady sound against the silence of the open road. The caffeine from my Sheetz coffee barely kept the fatigue at bay, my eyes flicking between the yellowed beams of my headlights and the dark expanse of trees lining the highway. 

The further I drove, the deeper the night seemed to swallow everything whole.
The Amish fields had come and gone, their endless rows of corn swaying like silent watchers in the wind. Now, the road was mine alone. No other cars. No signs of life. Just the rhythmic thrum of tires against pavement and the unsettling feeling that the world had emptied out behind me.

Then, in the rearview mirror, I saw them.
Two headlights—distant but unmistakable, cutting through the dark.

At first, I thought it was another car, maybe just catching up. But as I kept driving, they didn’t get any closer. They stayed there, a steady presence in the mirror, far behind me.

I frowned, my grip tightening on the steering wheel.
It was an old semi truck. The kind with the rusty grill and the battered trailer. The headlights glowed dim, flickering almost as if struggling to stay lit. 

They were far enough behind me that I couldn’t make out any details, just the shape of the truck, slowly trailing in my wake.

I tried to brush it off. Maybe it was just the quickest way for this truck to meet its destination. I knew truck drivers sometimes had near impossible deadlines, so snaking through a mountain where you might slip off it could’ve been a norm.

I continued to drive, trying to keep my mind blank to ease the growing nerves. My wife, Gabrielle, was fast asleep next to me. She probably passed out two hours into the drive. 

Those old '90s captain seats in the van were surprisingly comfy, after all. She could’ve slept in the bed I built in the back of the van, but the seat seemed to work its mysterious ways and brought her into dreamland.

At least she didn’t have to be awake while we passed through skin-walker territory. She hated driving through the Gap as much as I did, so honestly, I was glad she could sleep through it. I’d keep that burden to myself.

About 30 minutes passed, and I was leaving the Gap when I noticed the truck turn off. I hadn’t realized how close it had gotten—it was trailing about 500 feet behind me at that point. 

As it turned off, I saw it more clearly. It was an old logging truck, and my suspicions from earlier were right—it was a Peterbilt from the '80s. I’d always loved the way those trucks looked growing up.

I won’t lie, I felt a sense of relief watching it pull off onto some other road. Now it was just me again, by myself.

We were out of the receptionless mountain road for the most part, still some deep, wooded, unlit driving ahead, though. 

As I drove, my heart sank when I noticed it. It was there in the rearview. That truck? How the hell did it get there? I knew it was the same truck—the front headlight was about out, and the shape was unmistakable, shadowy and looming. 

What the actual hell, I kept telling myself.
I tried to keep my focus on the road, but all I could think about was how the hell he got right back behind me. 

He had been far away, at his original distance, but that road he turned off of led somewhere completely else. It didn’t merge back onto this road. How did he do it?

I started doing my best to pretend it wasn’t there, but the damn truck just kept getting closer. This time, it wasn’t like the creeping I’d felt earlier. 

I could feel the weight of it, the proximity of it. Closer, and closer he got. I was already speeding, pushing above the speed limit, just wanting to make it home and finally crash into my bed. But him? He must have been going 100 miles an hour, it seemed, absolutely flying down the road. 

I started pressing on the gas to make distance. 60. Then 70. Then 80.
It was still gaining on me as if I was at a crawl.

The yellow beams filled the cabin with an ungodly glow, casting long, warped shadows across the dashboard. My hands were slick with sweat, gripping the wheel so tightly my knuckles ached. I pushed Barbra harder—85. 90. The road was getting dangerous at this speed, the curves sharper, the trees closer, but the truck was still closing in.
300 feet.

It would be on us in seconds.
Then, up ahead, barely within view, I saw it—a dark, hidden road branching off to the right. I didn’t think. I didn’t hesitate. 

I yanked the wheel hard, slamming the brakes as I jerked Barbra into the turn.
The tires screamed against the asphalt. The van lurched sideways. For a terrifying second, I thought I’d lost control, that we were about to skid off into the trees. Gabrielle was whipped forward, nearly flying out of her seatbelt as Barbra’s tires fought for grip.

Then, silence.
We had made it.

But the truck—the truck never passed.
Gabrielle was awake now, wide-eyed and furious. ""Morgan, what the fuck?! Are you falling asleep at the wheel or what? Why did you do that?"" she yelled, breathless from the sudden jolt.

I was still gripping the wheel, heart hammering against my ribs. My mouth was dry. My body felt electrified with panic. I forced myself to speak, but my words stumbled out in a breathless stammer. ""Baby, there was a truck… h-h-he was chasing us.""

She stared at me, then at the empty road behind us.
There was nothing.
No headlights. No distant engine growl. Just darkness, thick and suffocating.
It hit me all at once—the truck had vanished the second I rounded that bend.
Gabrielle ran a hand through her hair, sighing in exasperation. 

""Morgan… what would a truck be doing out here at this hour? I know this place gives you the heebie-jeebies, but come on. You gotta stop being so paranoid every time we come through here. You almost killed us.""

She didn’t see it.
She didn’t feel it.

I swallowed hard, my pulse still erratic in my throat. Maybe she was right. Maybe I was losing it. The truck had already disappeared once before. Maybe it really was just my imagination.

Maybe.
But deep down, I didn’t believe that.
Not for a second.

Chapter 3: Screaming Pipes

With my heart still in my throat and my stomach in my ass, I whipped Barbra around and forced us back onto the main road. 

The tires screeched in protest, the smell of burnt rubber and oil choking the interior like a candle straight from mechanic hell. My pulse was hammering in my ears, my hands locked in a death grip around the wheel.

I glanced over at Gabrielle. She was awake now, silent, but her posture said everything—tense, arms crossed, jaw set. She didn’t have to say it. I already knew she was pissed. Pissed that I had nearly turned Barbra into a makeshift missile aimed at a row of trees.

The silence stretched between us, thick, heavy. I could feel her staring, waiting for me to say something.

Then finally—""Morgan, do you want me to drive? You look sick… and tired.""
I probably did. Sweaty, pale, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror every few seconds like I was expecting something to still be there. Like I was afraid it would be.

She didn’t see it.
She didn’t feel it.

I swallowed the lump in my throat and forced a breath through my nose, keeping my voice as even as I could. ""No, baby, I’m fine. I can drive. I’m sorry for almost crashing the van.""

She exhaled through her nose, shaking her head just slightly before turning back toward the window. The tension in her shoulders remained, but her frustration was beginning to fade, replaced by exhaustion.

I thought about making a joke, something to lighten the mood.
""Maybe if I sent Barbra into those trees, it would’ve been a strike. Spare, at least… spare tire.""

What a stupid joke, I thought.
I almost said it out loud, but judging by the way she was still pressed into the seat, I figured now wasn’t the time.

Tough crowd.

I let out a small breath and loosened my grip on the wheel, feeling the weight in my chest ease, if only slightly. The road stretched ahead, dark and quiet once again. The further we got, the more it felt like the night had swallowed whatever had happened back there.
Maybe I was just tired. Maybe I had imagined it.

I kept driving.
Finally, I felt I was slowly setting into easy. It had been close to 10 minutes, and there was no sign of the truck. I thought to myself that this must've been what the kids in Jeepers Creepers felt like.

Now that Gabrielle was awake and most certainly not going back to sleep, I figured it was the perfect time to fill the silence with something. Maybe music would help break the tension. 

I connected my phone to the Bluetooth media player we had installed in the van, scrolled to my playlist on Spotify, and hit shuffle.

Funny enough, I didn’t check the volume on the media player before. Huge mistake.
""AHHHH!""

The sudden blast of sound shook us both to the core. Layne Staley’s scream from Them Bones by Alice in Chains ripped through the van, booming so loud it felt like the speakers were going to explode.
As funny as it was, it scared the living hell out of both of us. 

I jumped so hard, my hands nearly jerked the wheel. Gabrielle, who was already on edge, let out a yelp and practically leapt out of her seat, clutching the armrest like it was the only thing keeping her grounded.

I could feel her glare from the corner of my eye. She didn’t say anything at first, but her silence was enough to know she was not amused.

I quickly fumbled to turn the volume down, my fingers scrambling like I was trying to stop a fire. The music didn’t stop, but the volume went from ear-splitting to a much more tolerable level.
""Seriously, Morgan?"" 

Gabrielle finally spoke, shaking her head with an almost pained look on her face. ""After everything, you really had to do that?""

I could barely stifle my laughter, even though I knew I was in the doghouse. ""Sorry, babe. Didn’t realize Spotify thought we needed that extra adrenaline boost.""

Her eyebrow shot up, but I could see the corner of her lips twitching as she tried not to smile.

I just nodded, trying to avoid another full lecture.

At least it broke the tension, I thought. Even if it was just for a second.
Five minutes had passed, and the silence between us wasn’t as suffocating anymore. 

The music was still playing softly, keeping the peace. But then, something odd started to happen.
At first, it was a small disturbance—a faint flicker in the song. Static started to creep in, slowly at first, almost as if the song was deteriorating. 

I thought maybe it was just the area we were in, no radio tower nearby, but then I remembered... we were using Bluetooth. This wasn’t a radio signal issue.
“Huh? That’s odd…” I muttered to myself, glancing at the media player, my brow furrowing.

“Baby, why’s the music doing that?” Gabrielle asked, her voice a little strained.
“I don’t know, I…” I trailed off, trying to figure it out. The static had completely drowned out the song now, filling the van with a thick, unnatural hiss.

I turned the volume down, then off completely, trying to clear the air. But the silence that followed wasn’t comforting. It felt heavy, like something had replaced it—a quiet kind of pressure that hung between us.

I glanced at the rearview mirror and blinked. The trees, the pale moonlight that had been softly lighting the road behind us, were gone. It was as if the light itself had been swallowed.
I leaned forward slightly, trying to see better.

“Wait, where did the trees go?” I mumbled, more to myself than to Gabrielle.

The road was dark now. And I mean pitch black, like someone had dimmed the world just behind us.

I stepped on the brakes, hoping to light up the road behind us. The van slowed, and the red glow from the brake lights stretched over the pavement. But then something caught my eye. Something wrong.

The shape in the mirror—at first, I thought it was a shadow, some kind of distortion from the brake lights. But then I saw it. The grill. A huge, metal, jagged grill, glaring out of the darkness, moving toward us.

My breath caught in my throat. How the hell was it so close?

The truck was right there. No more than five feet from us. It seemed to materialize out of nowhere. The moment I saw it, the roar of the engine exploded to life, a deep, vibrating growl that shook the van. The noise was so sudden and deafening, I jumped in my seat, my heart racing.
Gabrielle shot upright, eyes wide. “Morgan! What the hell is that?!”

I didn’t have time to answer, my eyes fixed on the rearview, heart pounding against my chest. The truck’s headlights snapped on, blinding in the mirror. They flared to life like they’d been waiting for the perfect moment, washing the cabin in an unforgiving yellow light.

The truck’s engine growled louder, almost alive in the way it thundered through the van’s interior. 

The headlights burned through the rear window like two deadly suns, and the truck seemed to get impossibly closer with every second.

“Morgan! What the hell is going on?!” Gabrielle screamed, her voice shaking.
I slammed my foot on the gas, desperate to put some distance between us, but the truck stayed right on our tail. It was close. Too close. 

I could hear the roar of its engine vibrating deep in my chest, and the headlights, still blinding, felt like they were cooking me alive.

Then, without warning, the truck’s grill ignited. Flames shot from its metal teeth, curling out into the air like a furnace had opened right behind us. The heat hit us instantly—searing, unbearable. 

The cabin felt like an oven. Sweat broke out all over my body as the fire light danced on the rearview mirror, stretching across the glass like it was reaching for us.

“God, it’s coming for us!” Gabrielle cried, her voice breaking.

It was too much. I couldn’t think. I couldn’t breathe. All I could hear was the roar, the crackling fire, the engine—and the screaming of my own heart in my chest.

It was getting so close I swore it was about to hit us. I was pushing 90, my foot jammed on the pedal, but it was still right there—right there on my tail. 

The van was screaming, the engine groaning, trying to keep pace, but it wasn’t built for this. 

I could feel every ounce of strain in the wheel, the tires, the shaking body of the van as it desperately fought to keep the road beneath us.

Gabrielle was screaming uncontrollably, but her voice felt miles away, drowned out by the monstrous roar of the engine. I felt her panic, but all I could hear was the fire. Every time my mouth opened to scream, the sound of that fire rushed in, drowning me, freezing me in place.

I forced myself to glance into the rearview mirror, praying that maybe, just maybe, I was imagining this, but I couldn’t look away. The truck. It was right there, so close. And there was no driver.
I could see it—eyes.

Glowing eyes. Red. Burning. They burned through the darkness like nothing I’d ever seen, like fire that couldn’t be extinguished, staring straight at me. 

Behind them was nothing. No body. No face. Just empty, glowing eyes. And beyond that... the seat. Just floating, empty, a vacant void where a driver should have been.

I felt the blood drain from my face. The truck wasn’t even trying to catch up anymore. It was us.

And then, just like that, the horn blared.
The sound wasn’t a regular truck horn. It didn’t sound like a horn at all. It was worse.

It was a scream.
A thousand screams. No, a thousand tortured souls, crying out from the depths of hell, their agony wrapped in the sound of fire, burning and screaming in unison. 

The sound twisted in my head, reverberated through my skull. The fire in the engine grew louder, the roar of it almost shaking the van, shaking me to my core.

The truck’s horn went off again, and this time it wasn’t just the sound—it was the heat. It pressed in on me, making the air thick, suffocating. The flames were everywhere now. The truck didn’t just roar—it bellowed like a beast rising from hell, and I couldn’t breathe. Every inch of me screamed to escape, but there was nowhere to go.

The fire—it was consuming us.
And it wasn’t just the heat, the flames, or the sound.
It was the eyes.
It was the truck, chasing us, dragging us, straight down to the inferno.

And then, just as I thought it was going to collide with us, right as I felt the impact was imminent—it happened.

The truck erupted in a blaze of fiery chaos, its entire body consumed by an inferno, the flames licking up the sides of the truck, curling and snapping like a beast tearing through the night. The heat was unbearable, scorching the air around us, but it wasn’t enough to keep it from vanishing.

The truck, in a heartbeat, was dragged down, pulled into the earth itself like something straight out of hell. It wasn’t just driving off or turning a corner—it was being swallowed.

The ground seemed to give way, as if the earth itself parted, and with a deafening roar of flames, the truck—that thing—was sucked down into the depths of the earth, as though Satan himself had reached up from the underworld and dragged it back. The truck’s lights flickered out in an instant, and all that was left was a haunting silence.
It was gone.

""Get away! Get away!"" she screamed over and over, her voice cracking with fear, her words coming out like a desperate, broken chant. Her face twisted in a kind of fear I had never seen before, as if her very soul was trying to flee the van itself, trying to escape from something far worse than what I had just witnessed.

I reached out, grabbing her shoulders, trying to steady her, but she was out of control, her body trembling violently. ""Gabrielle, baby—"" I tried to shout, but the words wouldn’t leave my mouth, swallowed up by the suffocating tension.
She didn’t even hear me. Her eyes were locked on the road ahead, her face pale and desperate. She didn’t even look at me anymore. 

She just kept screaming, “Get away! Get away!” each time more frantic, more guttural. Her hands were shaking as she pointed frantically at the dark, empty road ahead of us, her body pulling toward the dash like she wanted to escape whatever it was that she saw coming down that road.

Her screams echoed in the van, a haunting soundtrack to the madness unfolding around us, her breath coming in short, gasping sobs. The terror in her eyes—it wasn’t just fear; it was something worse, something primal, like she could feel the very presence of something that shouldn’t have been possible. Something dark, something evil, something that was about to consume us.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. I just kept driving, my hands shaking on the wheel, trying to keep control of Barbra, but it was hard to focus when I couldn’t even understand what she was seeing. ""Get away!"" she screamed again, her voice raw, barely audible over the sound of her terror.

I looked ahead, but the road was empty. Nothing but darkness ahead of us, the headlights illuminating an endless, empty stretch of road.

Out of nowhere, about 200 feet ahead of me, the ground exploded. The truck erupted from the earth like a volcano—its massive form more violent, more infernal than before. The flames that had once been contained now bled into the very air around it, filling the sky. It was facing us, charging straight toward us with an unrelenting fury.

Its eyes—no longer just lights—were now glowing embers, like the very essence of hell itself was burning in them, piercing through the windshield, locking onto me, consuming me. 

The flames were everywhere. A wall of fire, like it was being fed by some unholy power. My heart pounded in my chest. There was nowhere to run, no time to think. I screamed.

In an instant, I veered the van right off the road, straight into a field, my hands yanking the wheel in a desperate attempt to escape. 

But I lost control immediately. The van tilted dangerously. I could hear the tires skidding, screeching against the earth. And in my rearview mirror, the truck was right behind us, its infernal glow consuming the space between us. 

The heat radiated off it, like a furnace blowing against my neck, making the air burn.

I couldn’t stop it. The van was going to flip. I could feel it. My stomach dropped. My breath caught.

The truck hit us.

The impact was deafening, a sickening thud that sent the van skidding sideways. The flames licked at the rearview, burning the hairs off the back of my neck as the heat wrapped around me like a suffocating blanket. 

The van was thrown violently, rolling over itself, the world spinning, upside down and sideways, like time had no meaning.

Roll... roll... roll...

I didn’t know what happened after that. The world became a blur. The next thing I remember was the final roll, when the van slammed onto its side. 

I could hear the crunch of metal, the shatter of glass, and the horrifying screams of the truck’s horn blaring in the distance. 

I lay there for what felt like forever, dazed, my body thrumming with pain. But through the broken glass of the windshield, I saw it—the truck. Once again, it was consumed by the earth, dragged back into whatever infernal pit it came from. 

The earth itself seemed to swallow it whole, its glowing eyes fading into the darkness.

And the horn—oh god, the horn. That horrible, unearthly sound—the sound of a thousand souls, screaming as they were sucked back into hell. And just like that, the truck was gone.

I looked over at Gabrielle. Her eyes were wide open, locked in place, but there was no movement. 

Her body lay limp, her chest barely rising with shallow breaths. My heart skipped. My pulse roared in my ears. I felt a wave of pain crash over me—everything from the crash, the terror, the fire—it all slammed into me at once. 

The searing ache in my chest, the ringing in my head, it was too much. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think.

1ih9opg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ih9opg/flakey_girl_advice/,Flakey girl advice,"I met this girl a while ago at a common friend's party. We had a simple first date, we both had a good time. She texted me happy new year. After that she got sick, so I couldn't see her for some days. I texted her once to check up on her, maybe I should've been more attentive, given she was sick. Anyway, eventually I set up a second date. I thought it was good, I had a good time, felt compatible with her. After that I tried to schedule a third date, but she was busy on the weekend (works as a nurse with shifts), told her that she lets me know when she's free.

Anyway, I think this is where I might've gone wrong. I have a female therapist, she's around 55-60, really wise about human relationships, but obviously has a woman's perspective, and from a different time too. She thinks I was too aloof and took too much time to text between dates and whatnot. We didn't have many conversations over text admittedly, maybe I took the ""text is only to set up dates"" advice too much to heart. So instead of waiting for her to contact me I texted her a couple of times through the week, and asked her for another date eventually, to which she agreed, she suggested a coffee date, which was a bit disappointing as a third date, but I agreed. I texted her the day before (sunday) to check up on her and she told me she was really tired because of a night shift the day before, and asked if she could wait for tomorrow to confirm the date. I said no problem, talk to you tomorrow. Next day (monday) she texted a few hours before the date, this were our last 2 texts:

Her: Hi OP! I'm still really tired today, is it ok if we leave it for another day??  
Her: \*sad cat sticker\*  
Me: Hi <girl's name>, don't worry. Let me know when you feel better and are up for it, so we can arrange something. Have a good rest!

To which she didn't reply...

I think the best I can do is to try to meet another girl. I'm disappointed because I really liked her, but it seems she's not very into me. So I guess I should just stop texting her (I was texting her every 3-4 days) until she reaches out, if she does. Would you agree with that assessment? Am I being too pessimistic/optimistic?",0,1738643847.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

I'm going to write her a note to go along with the present. i was thinking about getting her the mug attached below, as she's a coffee addict - but I've seen lots of teachers say that they do not need any more mugs and they would want anything but a mug. I've also seen lots of suggestions to get band directors custom batons or custom stands, but I don't have the money and I also don't think she would appreciate it as much as something funny. she has a great sense of humor and she's really sarcastic. she has helped so many people and she stays after school every day just so people can practice. she is way to nice and she deserves the world. i'm devasted that I have to leave the school this year because I will miss her so so much - but that's not the point. please lmk any good suggestions or things you guys would want as band directors yourself!

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I deff have more.. I don’t wanna say energy but willingness. I feel like when stress comes my way, which a lot has lately, I can handle it well in the day time. But it has caused me stress nightmares even though my doctor prescribed me parazosin to go with it. So on the days I really get horrible sleep my irritability is TERRIBLE. I’ll be perfectly fine one moment and the next I could kill someone and then a few minutes later I’m fine. 

I also haven’t had my appetite or my nicotine cravings go down and I’m desperately trying to get my eating down for a calorie deficit. I feel like my nicotine craving has gone up?? I have been on zyns for over 2 years to help me with no vaping but I have an emergency pack of cigarettes in the car and I have been through two vape pods. Deff not smoking as much as I did when I was actively doing it but zyns used to help me. I think it’s like a vice to not drinking.

 I HATE DRINKING ON WELLBUTRIN. It makes it so much less fun, the effects less, and the hangover unbearable. I’m going completely sober for awhile for my weight loss but also so I don’t have to deal with any of horrible hangovers. 


Also I have IBS. Like the kind that constipates you. And Wellbutrin and my IBS have joined forces to shut that down completely. I talk still softeners and I’ll cramp but nothing. 

Also I am drinking some coffee but not as much before. As it’s been affecting my sleep I need something in the AM to make me coherent. But deff have to measure it. 

I guess my questions are…

Anybody relating to this?
Do I give it more time? 
Do I up the dose?

The world is full of things that suck. Slow internet? Sucks. Traffic jams? Suck. That feeling when you reach into your pocket and realize your keys aren’t there? Absolutely sucks. But you know what doesn’t suck? **Bitcoin.**

Bitcoin is the financial equivalent of an invincible superhero, the incorruptible, decentralized currency that gives power back to the people. Everything else? Meh. And if you’re not using **our Bitcoin QR Code Maker** to send and receive Bitcoin, you’re probably still living in the Stone Age—where everything also sucked.

Ready to leave behind the sucky world of traditional finance? Good. Let’s get into why **everything except Bitcoin sucks** and how our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** is here to make your crypto life ridiculously easy.

# Fiat Money: The Ultimate Dumpster Fire

Imagine having a money printer in your basement, churning out cash whenever you want. Sounds great, right? That’s exactly what central banks do, except instead of benefiting you, it causes inflation, making your hard-earned dollars worth less and less every year.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, doesn’t play that game. It has a fixed supply—21 million coins, ever. No politician, banker, or government bureaucrat can wake up one morning and decide to print more. It’s **hard money for hard people.**

And if you’re tired of jumping through hoops just to make a simple transaction, guess what? Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** cuts through the nonsense. Just generate a QR code, scan it, and boom—Bitcoin transferred. **No banks, no fees, no delays.**

# Banks: Where Your Money Goes to Die

Let’s talk about banks. You know, those institutions that charge you fees for *holding* your money, limit your withdrawals, and freeze your account if you dare to spend your own cash in a way they don’t like. Not to mention the 3-5 business days they take to process transfers (because they’re busy sipping overpriced lattes and discussing new ways to make your life miserable).

Bitcoin doesn’t need banks. **It is the bank.** With a Bitcoin wallet and our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker**, you can send and receive payments instantly—no middlemen, no permission needed. **You’re the boss of your own money.**

# Credit Cards: Fees, Debt, and Pain

Credit cards seem convenient—until you realize they’re basically modern-day shackles designed to keep you in debt forever. Swipe now, pay later, and then keep paying… forever. Oh, and don’t forget about those transaction fees merchants pass on to customers.

Bitcoin doesn’t do debt slavery. Transactions are final, low-cost, and peer-to-peer. And with our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker**, paying with Bitcoin is as easy as scanning a code. No fees, no interest rates, no nonsense.

# Apps That Spy on You: Big Brother is Watching

Ever wonder why you see ads for things you were *just* talking about? That’s because your favorite apps are selling your data faster than you can say “privacy violation.”

Bitcoin, however, is **the antidote to surveillance capitalism.** It’s decentralized and pseudonymous, meaning no creepy corporations tracking your every move. Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** lets you generate payment codes without handing over your personal information to some data-hungry tech giant.

# Traditional Payment Systems: Slow, Expensive, and Annoying

Think about the last time you sent an international wire transfer. The fees were ridiculous, it took forever, and you needed to provide more paperwork than a government job application. **Why does it take days to send money in 2024?**

Bitcoin moves at the speed of light compared to traditional banking. And with our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker**, all you need to do is scan, send, and boom—funds transferred **instantly.**

# Gold: Heavy, Old, and Useless in the Digital Age

Gold bugs love to tell you how their shiny metal has been a store of value for centuries. That’s great and all, but try using a gold bar to buy a cup of coffee.

Bitcoin is **digital gold**, but better. It’s **easier to store, move, and divide.** And if you need a seamless way to transact with Bitcoin? **Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker ensures you never have to fumble around with long wallet addresses.**

# How Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker Fixes Everything That Sucks

Alright, you get it—everything except Bitcoin sucks. But how do you actually use it efficiently? Enter our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker**—your gateway to effortless Bitcoin transactions.

✅ **Generate QR codes instantly** – Whether you’re receiving payments, sending funds, or just showing off how tech-savvy you are, QR codes make Bitcoin transactions seamless.  
✅ **Eliminate human error** – Typing in wallet addresses is a recipe for disaster. One wrong character and your Bitcoin is lost forever. **QR codes prevent that.**  
✅ **Perfect for merchants** – Accept Bitcoin payments at your business with zero hassle. Just display your QR code and let customers scan to pay.  
✅ **Totally free to use** – Because freedom shouldn’t come with a price tag.

# Stop Settling for What Sucks—Switch to Bitcoin Today

You don’t have to live in a world of slow transactions, hidden fees, and financial middlemen. Bitcoin **fixes money**, and our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** makes it ridiculously easy to use.

So what are you waiting for? **Ditch the outdated financial system.** Generate your free Bitcoin QR code now at [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) and start living in the future.
