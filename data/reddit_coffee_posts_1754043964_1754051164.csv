1mev3d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1mev3d5/blame_culture/,Blame culture,"This is not interesting, I'm just venting.

I work at a store with shitty management, and the employees who stay long are also little pieces of shit. The manager shits on the employees, and the employees in turn shit on the newer employees. I'm one of the new people.

One day my co-worker never showed up for his shift, so the store manager had to call him a half hour in. He showed up FOUR HOURS LATER and in the meantime I was asked to work the register in lieu of him (I'm supposed to be on the floor). Our store is so high volume that there is never not a line. We sometimes have 2 or 3 registers open.

We're so short staffed that day (3 people when there's supposed to be 4-6) that customers keep asking me if they should ""come back on a better day"" because I'm SINGLEHANDEDLY working the register, handling all pickup orders, and handling most customer requests while tethered to the register because they can't find ANYONE on the floor. 

FOUR HOURS LATER, the co-worker finally shows up and takes his shift at the register. The first thing he does is spill someone's old coffee (which was put away in the cabinet below the register) and TRY TO SHIFT BLAME ONTO ME. ""Is that your coffee? That's the worst possible place to put your coffee."" I politely informed him I don't drink coffee and didn't even know it was there!

Then the store manager spends the rest of the shift harassing ME because he doesn't want to direct his hostility at the guy who showed up late. That guy has been here for two years and gets special treatment. He's also an incel POS.

Then another day I've clocked out (20 minutes late because my fucking co worker was late) and am heading to the door. We are well staffed but busy. A customer asks me for help, so I look around and notice a co-worker a few feet away and direct this person to her. She goes ""well, I'm ALREADY helping a customer"" and acts like I did something wrong. Um, you're the shift manager? Why not just radio someone else to help? It's literally your job? I'm off the clock and maybe that's why I've got my bag and I'm heading to the door?

Just recently got diagnosed with evaporative dry eye.

I am seeing a dry eye specialist at the moment and am currently on Xdemvy to eliminate demodex as an inflammation factor. I also do Omegas, warm compresses (massage sometimes), and try to remember the 20-20 rule. I'm also trying out a healthier diet (mostly unprocessed foods and fish, I do drink a lot of coffee though).

Yes, I am aware that most dry eye is progressive. Yes, I know that there is technically no ""cure"". BUT I want to get people's input on what helps, and maybe help others with this post!

1mev309,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1mev309/read_this_if_you_are_unhappy/,Read this if you are unhappy,"For 10 years, I felt unhappy and worthless, and I didn't get along with anyone.

But that ninth grade year changed everything. In one year, I learned more than in my entire life.

​Today, I'm doing well. I want to help people who find themselves in the same situation I was. Here's what helped me grow and get out of that state.

# ​Main Needs

​I noticed this year that unhappy people are often unhappy because their basic needs aren't met.

**​Vital:** poor diet (junk food), lack of sleep.

**​Security:** unpredictable environment.

**​Social:** tragic family events, feelings of rejection, lack of affection.

**​Self-Esteem:** autism, introversion, overweight, sexual discomfort (e.g., being transgender).

**​Accomplishment:** Feeling worthless, not fully utilizing your abilities.

​The good news is that all of this can be improved. Most often, unhappiness isn't caused by a single thing, even if we don't realize it. If one of these needs isn't fully met, even if it seems trivial, do everything you can to improve it.

# ​Vital

**​Exercise a lot.**

Force yourself, even if you don't see the point. Believe me, it will bring you unexpected benefits. Exercising produces endorphins, which will make you happier in the long run. Motivation comes with discipline. Don't make excuses. As long as you're not seriously injured, go for it and adjust your schedule so you can always fit in a workout. To exercise a lot, you need to eat well, especially protein. Eggs are the cheapest source of protein.

**​Eat healthy.**

Force yourself too. Only eat foods with a Nutri-Score of A or B; it's fairly reliable most of the time. Avoid sugar and fat at all costs. Only if you feel unwell, eat a square of 70% dark chocolate, no more than one per day.

**Get the best sleep possible.**

Go to bed at 9 pm., put your phone in another room, out of sight. Don't use your phone as an alarm clock; buy a real one. If you don't really need one (ask a doctor or ask yourself), gradually cut out coffee (within two hours of waking up) and sleeping pills. Your body will adapt. If it doesn't need to create substances to wake you up and put you to sleep, it won't produce enough. You'll become dependent on coffee or sleeping pills. If you quit, it will take a few months for your body to return to normal, but your sleep will improve.

​For insomniacs like me, use this technique (used in the military):

​1. Lie flat on your stomach.

2. Relax all your muscles, even those in your head.

3. Don't think about anything. If you can't, think of a calm place like the sea.

4. Raise your eyes slightly and let them sink into your sockets.

5. Don't move.

**​Addictions**

​If you're determined, write down on a piece of paper the reasons why you want to quit and then stop. If you don't have enough motivation, stop gradually.

If you fight your urges, you'll eventually fall. When you have one, turn your head, close your eyes, and think of a pleasant or funny place. Not thinking about it will calm your urge.

​If you've fallen into pornography, drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes, it's probably because you wanted to escape some form of pain (guilt, depression, stress, etc.). Pain is like the ground: you can escape it temporarily by plane, but it's always temporary; you can't escape it. However, pain isn't a bad thing; it's thanks to it that you move forward. Without pain, there is no happiness.

If you fell into it because of your friends, change your friends; having bad people isn't a big deal when things are going well; it's when things are going badly that it becomes a big deal.

# ​Safety

**​Moving**

Speak calmly to your parents. If you move frequently because of schools, tell yourself that you can go to any school; it won't change anything. Adapt to your current situation, no matter how difficult it is. Future Career

Tell yourself that it's not a big deal if you failed your studies. It's never too late. Do your best to have the best career possible. Observe those who succeed and see what you can change about yourself. It's all a question of mentality, and you can change yours.

**Abusive Parents**

Speak calmly to your parents. If they don't listen to you, be more aggressive, guess what's going on in their heads, and tell them what they don't want to hear. Parents aren't perfect; they're just adults with more experience. Some are afraid because of trauma and can't accept that you're successful. You know better than them, and some are just lacking or experiencing injustice and taking it out on you.

# ​Social

**​Tragic Event**

If you can do something about it, give it your all; speaking calmly is always the best solution. If it's irreversible, even if it's hard, accept it. Even if it's your fault, you can't change the past.

**​Antisocial**

Before correcting a problem, you must first accept that it exists.

To get along well with others, be open (talk easily, don't isolate yourself), confident (respect yourself and be comfortable), humble (respect others, listen to them, and admit your faults), and positive (talk and put situations into perspective). If you apply these tips, everything will go well. Observe people who get along well with everyone and see what you can change about yourself. Feelings of Social Rejection

If you're too shy, talk to others more often, even if you're afraid. Your shyness will gradually disappear, I promise. But don't push yourself too hard; people can sense when you're uncomfortable. Find a balance between what you want and what others want. Don't try to attract attention or be interesting. Also, avoid talking about obscene subjects, even jokingly; it can give a bad impression of your state of mind.

**​If you're not nice**

Respect yourself, otherwise you won't be able to respect others. Be humble, think before you speak, admit when you're wrong and be positive, listen to others when they confide in you. Just be nice.

Don't hesitate to change your group of friends.

Seeing a psychologist is nothing to be ashamed of; if you need it, do it.

# Self-Esteem

**Autism/ADHD**

If you think you have been diagnosed with ADHD, autism, or anything else, accept it and tell yourself it's okay. Complaining won't help. You're not doomed; having autism or ADHD doesn't mean you're stupid or limited. It's just a different way of thinking. You're not worthless; it's a question of mentality. It's a bit like a person missing a leg. This disability won't be an excuse to stay at home for the rest of their life. All you have to do is find a solution, temporary or permanent. With a temporary solution (crutches), they can walk; with a permanent solution (a prosthesis), they can run, just like anyone else. If you have trouble understanding others, observe those who succeed where you fail and see what you can change about yourself. Don't seek attention. Sleep and eat as well as possible to be in good shape and react better.

**​Overweight**

Stopping diets—I know it's counterintuitive, but it makes you gain weight. When the body thinks food is scarce (because you haven't eaten for a long time), it stores as much fat as possible when you start eating again to optimize your chances of survival. You need to eat less, but gradually. Eat at set times: morning, noon, and evening, and only if you're hungry. Don't eat out of habit (in front of a screen, out of boredom or sadness). Don't eat anything sweet or fatty (burgers, sodas, pizzas, cakes). Choose foods with a good Nutri-Score (A or B) like vegetables, fruits, and grains (rice, wheat, pasta). Don't add salt to your meals if possible.

**​Underweight**

Exercise a lot. Eat a lot, even when you're not hungry, but avoid fat and sugar. Eat dairy products (calcium), fruit, meat (calories and fat), and eggs (protein).

**​Short stature**

You haven't reached your maximum height yet. Growth stops around age 18 for girls and 21 for boys. Exercise, sleep well, and, very importantly, eat well: dairy products (calcium), eggs (protein), and meat (calories).

# ​Achievement

It's a mindset issue. Take risks. If the risk is low and you have something to gain, do it. Believe in your goals, don't give up, don't overthink things, and act now. If you're feeling lazy, force yourself to exercise, eat well, and sleep well. If you're looking for an audience because you're not successful enough in your field, go somewhere where there are lots of people, like social media, and make short, funny videos to talk about your passion and your work.

# ​Mindset

​IT'S ALL A MATTER OF MENTALITY WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

​Determination: The biggest problem for people at rock bottom is a lack of determination. They're too lazy or too fearful to take action. Stop saying it's not your fault. Even if it's true, you're not doomed. You're not worthless; have willpower. Do things even if you don't want to; that's discipline. Motivation comes with action. The more you do things you don't like, the easier it will become. I used to be very lazy, but this year I started weight training. I did it every day, even when I didn't feel like it, and it was hard. Today, I go at it effortlessly. My laziness has completely disappeared, not only for sports, but also for studying and anything that requires effort.

We are not what we are, we are what we continuously do.

**​Stop blaming others**

When we are unhappy, it's almost always because of our mentality, even if we don't realize it. We blame others, the government, society... But the truth, even if it's hard to accept, is that when everyone else is a problem, maybe you are the problem. Even if others aren't perfect, you have to change. It's easier to change yourself than to change others. Stop looking for excuses, look for solutions. As I said before, a person with one leg missing can walk on crutches and run on a prosthesis. If a monkey doesn't survive in the jungle, it's not because the jungle is too dangerous, but because it's weaker than it should be. Try to be more trusting, open, humble, and kind, and you'll be fine with others.

**​The pursuit of happiness**

Many people see happiness as a goal, but they often focus on short-term happiness: junk food, pornography, entertainment, comfort. True happiness is found in long-term things that aren't initially pleasant: sports, reading, activities with friends. Don't see happiness as a goal. Instead, ask yourself, ""What pain am I willing to go through to achieve it?"" »

**​The future matters more than the past**

80% of suicidal people don't want to die, but just to stop suffering. Even if your current situation is terrible, stop complaining and do your best to change it. If you already think you're trying everything, it's because you're not determined enough or you're not doing it the right way. The solution is sometimes right in front of you. The future matters more than the past and the present. Move forward without looking back. Feeling like a loser or having a bad experience isn't a problem; the problem is staying that way.

**​Mental Limits**

Our life experience helps us progress, but it can also block us. Sometimes our past life limits us and prevents us from understanding certain things, changing our minds, or applying simple solutions. Just because your life has been hard up to now doesn't mean it always will be. Take risks, think differently without considering your limits, and don't be afraid to try something new, even if it didn't work for you before. You've changed in the meantime, even in a few weeks. At the end of your life, you'll regret more what you didn't do than what you did.

**​Negativity**

Be positive. If you're convinced that everything will go wrong, everything will go wrong. But if you're convinced that you'll succeed, if you're determined and give your all, there's a good chance you'll succeed. Even if you're at a disadvantage, some people with intellectual disabilities have managed to learn to write, others with physical disabilities play sports, thanks to their iron mentality. Realize how lucky you are. Your situation could have been so much worse: born in a poor country, with crime, having bad parents, being born with Down syndrome, or committing suicide. But you live in a rich country, with freedom. Most people don't realize how lucky they are.

Change takes time. You won't change in a few days or weeks; it takes months, or even years. But believe me, it's worth it because you'll be happy for the rest of your life.

I’m not saying *no one* uses them anymore, but more and more of my friends—and people I talk to—are just over it. Like, fully tapped out. And honestly? I get it.

*Here’s what I think is going on:*

# 1. The Vibes Are Off.

Dating apps used to feel exciting. Now they’re just... stale. Endless swiping, small talk that leads nowhere, and way too many dead conversations. It’s starting to feel like work, not fun. Most people I know just want something real, not another “wyd” at 11pm.

# 2. Algorithms Can’t Fake Chemistry.

Let’s be honest—no app is gonna know your vibe. You can match with someone who looks great on paper (or on-screen), but meet up and there’s *nothing.* No spark. No flow. Meanwhile, the person you actually vibe with could be sitting two seats down at a local open mic night.

# 3. Real-life Just Hits Different Now.

After years of being glued to our phones (shoutout to the pandemic), a lot of us are craving real eye contact. Like, that *accidental glance across the room* kinda thing. Meeting someone through a friend or at an event feels way less awkward now than starting cold in an app chat.

# 4. We're Tired Of The Fake Version Of People.

Everyone’s putting their best filtered self forward online, but IRL? You get to see the quirks, the awkward laughs, the nervous gestures. It’s just more *real*. You can’t edit your way through a conversation at a coffee shop.

# 5. People Are Meeting Through Hobbies Again.

I know folks who met playing pickleball, at improv classes, even in co-working spaces. Not even trying to date—just being out in the world. And boom. Connection. There’s something about bonding over a shared activity that makes things feel natural.

# 6. It’s Better For Our Brains, Honestly.

Dating apps kinda mess with your head. One minute you're getting matches and feeling good, the next you're getting ghosted and questioning everything. It's a cycle a lot of people are stepping away from. Mental health first, ya know?

**Anyway—TL;DR:**

Gen Z isn’t ditching dating apps out of nowhere. We’re just leaning more into stuff that feels *authentic*. You might still keep the apps around, but real-life interactions are making a serious comeback. And it’s kinda refreshing.

Anyone else feel the same? Curious how others are meeting people these days.",1,1754051030.0,u_Thomas96354752,0,1.0,False

New to van life and want to buy my first van to convert. My user case is to use the van for day use rather than overnight camping. We often venture out to forests and ares of interest but like the idea of being able to use the van as a base to feed the kids have a coffee and a sit down and if needed retreat from the elements. 

What’s tricky is I have 2 kids ages 2 and 1 month old so I use 2 car seats. I’m struggling to find a setup which allows me to have both car seats in the car and have a good enough space left over. 

I would like to be able to stand up in the van too. I have seen ford transit custom do a multi cab variety which has 2 seats in the back but can’t really find them used. 

I’m probably going to finance the van but budget would be around 10-15k as this will be my main runabout to. Wife already has our actual main car so this I’m flexible when it comes to what I drive. Current an d fiesta :/

Anyone had a similar user case or have suggestions.

Would love some advice here.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Brewers vs. Nationals: A Tale of Two Teams (and Why Milwaukee’s Pitching Won’t Let You Down)**

The Milwaukee Brewers (64-44) and Washington Nationals (44-64) are set to collide at Nationals Park on August 1, 2025, in what promises to be a game as lopsided as a tipped啤酒 mug at a bar. The Brewers, baseball’s version of a well-polished espresso machine, are favored at -154, implying a 60% chance to win. The Nationals, meanwhile, are +232 underdogs—roughly the odds of me understanding a umpire’s explanation of a called third strike. Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet-obsessed fanboy and the humor of a comedy writer who’s seen too many rain delays.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Brewers Are the Statistical Choice

The Brewers’ implied probability (60%) is backed by a 34-19 record in games they’re favored, plus a top-five team ERA (3.20) and a WHIP so low, it’s probably wearing a tuxedo. Their offense, eighth in the majors at 4.8 runs per game, is like a steady drip of coffee—reliable, never overwhelming, but always there.

The Nationals? Their 40% underdog win rate (37-55 in 92 games) is about as impressive as a toddler’s attempt to parallel park. With a 5.10 ERA and a WHIP higher than a skyscraper, their pitching staff is a sieve held together by duct tape and hope. Their offense? A meager 4.3 runs per game—think of it as a team of polite guests who refuse to raid the snack table.

The moneyline (-154 for Milwaukee) suggests you’d need a time machine to bet on Washington and win. The spread (-1.5 for the Brewers) is basically a heads-up: the Nationals aren’t just losing; they’re losing by *at least two runs*. And the total (9 runs, under favored) hints at a pitchers’ duel… or a mercy rule waiting to happen.

### Key Players & News: Quintana vs. Parker, or “Why This Is a Foregone Conclusion”

1mev0hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/marginal/comments/1mev0hy/the_tragedy_of_indias_governmentjob_prep_towns/,The Tragedy of India’s Government-Job Prep Towns,"In [Massive Rent-Seeking in India’s Government Job Examination System](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/07/massive-rent-seeking-in-indias-government-job-examination-system.html) I argued that the high value of government jobs has distorted India’s entire labor market and educational system.

> India’s most educated young people—precisely those it needs in the workforce—are devoting years of their life cramming for government exams instead of working productively. These exams cultivate no real-world skills; they are pure sorting mechanisms, not tools of human capital development. But beyond the staggering economic waste, there is a deeper, more corrosive human cost. As Rajagopalan and I have argued, India suffers from&nbsp;[premature imitation](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_24_2_01_rajagopalan.pdf): In this case, India is producing Western-educated youth without the economic structure to employ them. In one survey, 88% of grade 12 students preferred a government job to a private sector job. But these jobs do not and cannot exist. The result is disillusioned cohorts trained to expect a middle-class, white-collar lifestyle, convinced that only a government job can deliver it. India is thus creating large numbers of educated young people who are inevitably disillusioned–that is not a sustainable equilibrium.

The Economist has an [excellent piece on the lives of the students](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.economist.com/interactive/1843/2025/07/24/would-you-pass-the-worlds-toughest-exam) including Kumar who is studying in “Musallahpur Haat, a suburb of Patna where dozens of coaching centers were concentrated, and the rent was cheap.”

> …About half a million students are currently preparing for government exams in Musallahpur….For most government departments the initial tests are similar, and have little direct bearing on the job in question. Would-be ticket inspectors and train-drivers must answer multiple-choice questions on current affairs, logic, maths and science. They might be asked who invented JavaScript, or which element is most abundant in the Earth’s crust, or the smallest whole number for _a_&nbsp;if&nbsp;_a_456 is divisible by 11. Students have no idea when their preparations might be put to use; exams are not held on a fixed schedule.
> 
> …Kumar made his way to the bare, windowless room his friend had arranged for him to rent and started working. Every few days, he’d check the Ministry of Railways website to see if a date had been set for the exams. The days turned into weeks, then months. When the covid pandemic erupted he adjusted his expectations – obviously there would be delays. The syllabus felt infinite and he kept studying, shuttling between libraries, revision tutorials and mock test sessions. Before he knew it he’d been in Musallahpur nearly six years.
> 
> As his 30s approached, Kumar began to worry about running out of time. There is an upper age limit for the railway exams – for the ones Kumar was doing it was set at 30. As a lower-caste applicant he was allowed to extend this deadline by three years. His parents urged him to start thinking about alternative careers, but he convinced them to be patient. His father, who was struggling to keep up the allowance, reluctantly sold some of the family’s land to help support him, and Kumar studied harder and longer.

In my post, I emphasized the above-average wages and privileges, which is true enough, but even by Indian standards many of the jobs aren’t great and [The Economist](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.economist.com/interactive/1843/2025/07/24/would-you-pass-the-worlds-toughest-exam) puts more focus on respectability and prestige (the sad premature imitation I discussed):

> Indian society accords public-sector jobs a special respect. Grooms who have them are able to ask for higher dowries from their brides’ families. “If you are at a wedding and say you have a government job, people will look at you differently,” said Abhishek Singh, an exam tutor in Musallahpur.
> 
> Railway jobs in particular still have a vestigial glow of prestige.
> 
> …[Kumar] had been preparing for junior engineer and assistant train-driver jobs, but decided to apply for the lowest rung of positions too, the Group D roles, to increase his chance of getting something. An undergraduate degree and six years studying in Patna could lead to him becoming a track-maintenance worker. “I never imagined it would come to this,” he said sadly.
> 
> And yet he wouldn’t trade it. A short drive from his room in Musallahpur, a glitzy mall has just been built. There are jobs going there which pay close to what he might earn in a Group D role. But Kumar baulked at the suggestion he might become a barista. “I am educated with a technical degree,” he said. “My family hasn’t sacrificed so much for me to work in a coffee shop. People only work there if they have no other choice.” No one from his parents’ generation would respect a barista. But they admired, or at least understood, a job on the railways.

India’s government job system squanders talent, feeds on obsolete and socially-inefficient prestige hierarchies, and rewards years of sterile preparation with diminishing returns. It’s inefficient, of course, but behind the scenes it’s devastating to the young.

I've been going to office everyday (cuz I like to) I haven't made any acquaintance yet, its weird. In all my previous companies, I would've at least gone out once for coffee or a smoke with my colleagues during work but not here. I have a great difficulty in starting conversations with strangers especially in person, but someone would've asked me to go with them to cafeteria or somewhere for a chat. But the colleagues don't look like they're super introverts as I can see them talking to everyone and of course go off in groups. I cannot help but think if it is because of my skin color or that I'm from southern part of India or that I don't speak hindi fluently (I do understand hindi and can hold conversation but I prefer english as its easier in flow), and its not like the colleagues don't speak english, they do really well.

I clearly did not check the price tag cause I get to checkout and the barista says “just so you know, that’s our ‘competition grade’ roast and it’s $50..” and I hesitate at first cause I completely missed that while I was standing in line but then didn’t wanna be that guy so I said screw I’ll get them. So yeah, definitely my most expensive bean purchase and now I’m curious what others have spent. I’m currently experimenting with different brews (I’m very much a novice) but if anyone has any recommendations please feel free to pass them along!

TLDR I bought a $50 250g bag of beans in San Diego because the name of the roast was (almost) the same as a soccer player I grew up watching. ",4,1754050724.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1meuwwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1meuwwk/changes_to_relationship_after_getting_sober/,Changes to relationship after getting sober?,"46F, 47M, together 7 years, living together 3 years. Partner drinks very infrequently and when he does, does so responsibly. 

TLDR: I stopped drinking and am having small but almost daily conflict with partner. We are both annoyed a lot and I’m not sure if it’s me not drinking or…? And not sure if this is common or what to do. 

I have ADHD, CPTSD and am in perimenopause so kind of ragey even on HRT. For the last few years, I’ve “managed” my symptoms by drinking copious amounts of coffee half the day to calm the ADHD so I can work and then switching to alcohol later in the day to tamp down anxiety and the peri irritability and get to sleep. After I got laid off this spring (thanks tariffs!) I began skipping the coffee and basically drinking all day. Not good.

About 6 weeks ago, I cut out alcohol entirely. I am sleeping better and have more energy which is great.

However, my partner feels like I am constantly annoyed by him, looking to point out that he’s wrong about things, think he’s stupid, and am giving him “looks”. Just about any interaction lately ends with him saying “I can’t say/do anything right. I don’t know why I bother” and him retreating to gaming. 

To be fair, I AM annoyed. The house is his and it looks like a hoarder house. It stresses me out. There are 3 rooms in the house that I kind of “own” and keep tidy and clean: master bath, kitchen, and my home office. I won’t even go in the living room and our bedroom looks like a bomb exploded. I do most of the cooking which I enjoy. I take care of all of the dog stuff though one of the dogs is his.

What annoys me is that I’ll be cleaning or cooking or running errands and he’s gaming or napping. Or I’ll be in the middle of something and he comes into the room and starts some random project and is in my way/making a mess or he interrupts me to show me a stupid reel or something while I’m literally cooking and listening to a book. 

He has ADHD (completely unmanaged) so he jumps from one thing to another and doesn’t finish anything. So he’ll pull out all sorts of tools or whatever and then just abandons the stuff when his “game break” is over. Or if I ask for help with thing A, he gets distracted and starts working on thing B. 

Example: I was having trouble with the dishwasher. Asked him to look at it. We have a new dishwasher in the garage and have had it for months but he hasn’t installed it. He came in to look and then? Got his tape measure and started talking about a full kitchen renovation project. I was trying to make dinner and he was in my way and jabbering about plans—he’s had these “plans” since I met him. 

Anyway…I don’t remember being this annoyed before. And I do think I’m maybe being more short with him because without booze on board, I’m way more type A and just want to get on with things. It even feels like he talks too slowly. His stories take forever, he loses his track of mind, and in my head I’m just like “get to the point!”

It also feels like maybe I’m being more direct and he is taking it a different way and I am baffled. 

Example: he took a nap after work. He woke up while I was making dinner. Came out and said “don’t make a ton of food, I’m not that hungry.” I said “okay. Should be good as I only prepared a serving and a half of shrimp.” His reply “shrimp isn’t going to fill me up.” Me “Well then this should work out well.” And then he got mad and said I was picking a fight. 🤷‍♀️

So it could be I need to adjust my hormones again but I’m wondering if anyone has experienced this after getting sober? It’s literally every interaction lately. This is NOT our normal. 

It has been a rough year. I lost my horse of 33 years, got laid off, lost my dog, we lost my MIL, he’s got some health issues, money is tight (I am the breadwinner), I quit drinking, and recently one of our dogs was really sick. So lots going on and maybe that’s part of it too. 

Any help appreciated.

1meutj2,https://www.youtube.com/watch/F4A9SJkwh2Y,"Pre workouts with real focus, not just caffeine in a lab coat","I expected focus.

I did not expect Excel mode.

After testing 40+ pre workouts, I’ve had some weird days.

One had me reorganizing my fridge, calculating my weekly protein intake, and sorting socks by color lol.

Not all of them hit like that though.

Some were straight caffeine lies in a $60 tub.

Others gave me headaches, brain fog, or zero noticeable benefit.

Here’s the breakdown of what I’d actually buy again.

# What worked

**El Jefe Neuro**

Alpha GPC, DMAE, cognatiq coffee extract. Clean focus with no crash.

Cost: Around $2.5 per serving.

Taste: 6/10, kind of chemical but drinkable.

Effect: Clear thinking within 30 minutes. Energy lasted about 4 hours and solid focus/productivity all day.

**Magico**

Alpha GPC, L-dopa, tyrosine. This one just hits.

Cost: $2.5 per serving, but half scoop still works.

Taste: 8/10. Fruity and smooth.

Effect: All day tunnel vision. No anxiety. My go to for productivity.

**Tweak**

350mg caffeine plus ProGBB. Technically a fat burner but feels like a mental pressure washer.

Cost: About $2 per serving.

Taste: 7/10. Sweet. But I was already sweating after one sip.

Effect: Overdrive mode. Makes you want to clean and start a business.

**Wrecked**

Standard citrulline-heavy pre workout. But solid for daily use.

Cost: Around $1.8 per serving.

Taste: 8/10. Tastes great.

Effect: Mild focus. Reliable. No sketchy side effects.

Final thoughts

Those were the four that actually worked.

Every other one I tested just felt like caffeine with a smart label.

If it’s not listed here, I wouldn’t use it again.

What’s the worst nootropic pre workout you’ve ever tried?

Ever dropped $60 on a tub that did nothing?

1meurvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1meurvd/legs_lungs_life_can_someone_here_please_help_my/,"Legs, lungs, life. Can someone here please help my dad? (6 years of hell)","Hi. I'm writing as no more than a desperate cry for help at this point. My dad (61 years old) has been sick for 6 years. We've seen probably 40+ doctors and specialists, he's on a buttload of meds, he's done test after test and he's just getting worse. Nothing is helping, and even more important: NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM!

Start of illness:

One morning six year ago I went up to my dad's place in the morning to have coffee. I found him sitting in a chair, out of breath, with chest pain. Ambulance was called (I assumed heart attack, so did they) and he was sent to the ER. No evidence of heart attack was found, no issue with the heart at all besides high blood pressure. And he never recovered. Everything has gradually become worse. Ever since that day he can barely walk, or breathe. His body just misfires in some way. 

Continuation of illness:

He can't breathe properly. He does these exhalation tests both st home and at the doctors, and his numbers are abysmal. And ever slowly getting slightly worse. He's gotten a CPAP machine line 5 years ago and that makes it slightly easier at night, but not by much. Walking just a few steps is hard for him, and he has virtually no balance. He uses crutches and a walker depending on where he's going.

He can barely walk. He has trouble lifting his legs and his thighs especially aren't working. When he does a walking test (how far can you walk in 6 minutes) he's down to 20 meters, I think. Something like that. He needs to stop all the time. Yawns and breathes heavily even after a few steps. His legs also hurt A LOT, especially at night. And as I said, his balance is horrible. Dystrophy found in legs this year. 

His nerves don't function properly. They done various neurological tests, abs the nerves in his legs abs feet aren't really responding. The response they do get is slow and weak.

He has terrible tremors. Specifically in his hands. They're minor or not there at all at rest, but even minimal effort (lifting a cup) causes severe tremors in both hands.

Hia blood pressure is weird. It differs from left to right and differs from minute to minute even at rest. I'm probably explaining it poorly but this is something at least one of his doctors has focused quite a bit on.

There are many other things as well, but these are the main ones, I think. 

What doctors have done:

So, so many tests. Especially lungs. Multiple imaging done every year, shows nothing. Heart checked every year, nothing. Neurological tests on his legs as mentioned above. Testing for genetic disease, diabetes and COPD. Tests show nothing. 

What they haven't done are imaging of head and spine, which I've been pushing for. But no response.

Probably unimportant info about patient:

61 years old. Swedish. Obese. Former smoker. Exposed to lots and lots of stuff like pain thinners and mineral turpentine (his father was a painter who did all of his art at the kitchen table all throughout my dads childhood). Non-drinker. Dementia and alzheimers in family but only (AFAIK) in heavy drinkers. His mother was in a gulag since childhood and most family members there were executed, so no real medical history there. He does suffer from bad headaches, but those have been a thing for a long, long time. 

There are lots of things I haven't written and I don't have the exact meds they've put him on right now (mostly related to blood pressure). But I'll happily dig as best I can if anyone needs more info. I know this is a fairly unhinged post all over the place, but I hate what is happening to him. 

And again: NONE of this existed before that morning when I found him. None at all. He had a fairly physical job and averaged between 15000-20000 steps a day. Was in good shape besides a moderately big gut. And then everything changed in a second. Walking, tremors, everything. Right at once.",1,1754050205.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1meurqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1meurqt/should_you_buy_the_elite_gourmet_ehc4128_4cup/,Should You Buy the Elite Gourmet EHC4128 4-Cup Coffee Maker?,"I’ve spent a good few weeks brewing coffee every morning with the Elite Gourmet EHC4128, and it’s safe to say I’ve had plenty of time to discover what this 4-cup drip coffee maker is all about. I’ve used it in my tiny kitchen, tossed it into the mix in a dorm setting during my cousin's visit, and even packed it for a short camping trip in our RV. Let’s just say, this little machine has been through quite the run, and I’ve got the inside scoop on how it holds up.

**Compact and Sleek Design**  
This coffee maker is compact, and frankly, that’s probably what drew me to it in the first place. With limited counter space in my kitchen, I’ve grown to appreciate appliances that don’t hog all the attention. Measuring just 8 inches deep, 9 inches wide, and 6 inches tall, it fits effortlessly between a toaster and a kettle. Its modern black finish matches almost any kitchen aesthetic, giving it a bonus point for style. While it’s not the tiniest coffee maker I’ve seen, it does store away nicely if you’re short on space. It’s an excellent pick for someone who’s in a dorm room or even a small office.

**Straightforward Functionality**  
Using the coffee maker didn’t require studying an instruction manual for hours. It’s fully automatic, with an easy on/off button and intuitive design. The semi-transparent water reservoir with a level indicator is another handy feature that keeps you from overfilling, especially on groggy mornings when measuring isn’t your strong suit. Whether you’re brewing a cup for yourself or serving a few guests, the machine delivers a consistent 4-cup serving every time.  

[Check Elite Gourmet EHC4128 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0czqctd4k/)

**Positives**  
It’s got a few winning points that have kept me coming back for more cups of freshly brewed coffee day after day.  

- The Pause ‘N Serve function is an absolute lifesaver when impatience rules my mornings. Pull out the carafe mid-brew, pour yourself a cup, and let the machine finish its job without any spills.  
- The reusable filter is an underrated addition. Not only is it eco-friendly, reducing the need for disposable paper filters, but it’s also ridiculously easy to clean.  
- Keeping that coffee warm is crucial, and the Keep Warm function works like a charm. Brew your coffee and leave it on the warming plate; it’ll stay hot until you’re ready for another cup.  
- Cleaning is entirely hassle-free since the removable parts, including the filter, are dishwasher-safe.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
While the experience has been surprisingly pleasant overall, a few areas could use some tweaking.  

- The glass carafe’s 4-cup capacity might not be enough for larger families or when you’ve got a houseful of guests.  
- The lack of programmable settings may not sit well with those who prefer customizing their brew times. If you’re someone who wants the coffee ready the moment your alarm rings, this might not be your best bet.  
- The black finish, while stylish, is prone to showing fingerprints and smudges, which means regular cleaning is necessary if aesthetics matter to you.  

**Brewing Performance**  
Performance-wise, the coffee maker does a decent job. I’ve tried a variety of ground coffee blends with it, from bold roasts to flavored options, and the taste is consistently satisfying. The brewing time is quick enough—perfect for someone always on the go. However, hardcore coffee enthusiasts might find the flavor profile a touch muted compared to high-end coffee machines that cost significantly more. It’s not going to make barista-style espressos, but if you enjoy a solid cup of basic drip coffee, it gets the job done.

**Competing Brands**  
Being a relatively basic machine, I couldn’t help but compare it to others in its category. The product is in the same league as Mr. Coffee’s 5-Cup Mini Brew and the Black+Decker 5-Cup Coffee Maker. While Mr. Coffee offers a slightly larger carafe, it lacks the reusable filter, making the Elite Gourmet a more eco-friendly option. The Black+Decker, on the other hand, is similarly compact but doesn’t boast the Pause ‘N Serve feature. I’d say this product stands out with its balance of practicality and efficiency, though it doesn’t offer many advanced features compared to its peers.

**Cost Performance**  
When you think about what you’re getting versus what you’re spending, this coffee maker delivers solid value for money. Sure, it’s not packed with programmable features, but at this price point, it’s hard to complain. It’s ideal for someone who wants an affordable, no-frills coffee machine that’s reliable and easy to maintain. If you’re looking for something budget-friendly that doesn’t skimp on the basic necessities, this is worth considering.

She told me she found big stash of ciggrette butt in his almirah and she was very shocked,she already knew he smoked sometimes but they were too many to excuse and she talked to him about it.

After discussion and small argument They both decided he will quit smoking and one habit she will give up from her life which is tea(which she cant live without).

She said after 2-3 months again she found a butt and was very hurt and to show it to him she called him to her in the evening and sat ar drank tea in front of him which shocked him and made him understood she has found out.

Another instance she once told is when he was a very young boy he used to put his hand under he t shirt and sleep at night and one night he did it again recently and she said it was fine he just needed to sleep good.

She takes him out for coffee dates whenever he feels stressed.

Many posts will say “cause I’m selfish”. But is it truly being selfish to not want a child that you never had in the first place? Or is it being self aware of your limits? 

I think we should get rid of saying “cause I’m selfish”. Start saying “cause I’m self aware enough to know that’s not something I want to invest my energy into”. 

If you think about it, we are hardwired to self preserve. And maybe in the old days, that meant having a lot of kids to preserve the family name or to ensure your genes continue. But in the current world we live in today, we literally need to focus on preserving ourselves. We’ve inflicted so much pain on this planet. So many species dying off and forests being destroyed because most people just want to consume. 

Idk how people are affording to have kids these days honestly. As someone who grew up poor and climbed my way out of it… I FINALLY feel like I can breathe with the safety nets I’ve built and sacrificed for over time. I love being able to relive my childhood as an adult with being able to do whatever I want, when I want. I get to create that for myself. So why, when I finally feel like I am doing some what ok, would I want to sign up for an insane amount of responsibility, that will suck up all of my time and money? Kids are cute. I love my nieces and nephews. But when I see the toll kids take on my brother and sister at any function I’m at with them… it’s a hard pass.

1meuln8,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1meuln8/what_i_love_about_the_signs_as_a_leo/,What i love about the signs (as a Leo),"I saw this post by a psychologist here and I agree that there's a lot of hate. Now this doesn't discredit our subjective experiences with the signs. So to lighten it all up, here's what i love about each sign. 

Aries : You love the thrill. You love the competition. You don't know how many people You inspire through your journey. When you love, you love HARD. You bring different perspectives to the table and you deserve to be appreciated for that. 

Taurus : You do not get enough praise for having people's backs. Yes, i said it. Taurus, when you're generous, you live up to that term. You go all out when it comes to helping your friends. You make sure you pull them out of their slump. Your words might not make sense to them and that's a different thing. But the fact that you're stubborn about your beliefs is something I admire about you all. 

Gemini : Geminis with the big beautiful brains. Yes, they're chatty but I've come across the less chatty ones as well. Mind you, they know their shit. Geminis you are jacks of all trades and masters of none but is that a bad thing ? No, it just shows how diverse you are. Your interests cannot be constricted to one particular genre or form. You're multifarious. Keep it up! 

Cancer : Okay so people think you can be manipulative and villanous but i know you're more than that. You're more than your hurt and honestly, you are some of the most coolest bosses I've ever had. You probably don't understand the nitty gritties but the fact that you try, that itself is a big thing. 

Leo : First of all, Happy Birthday Leos. You deserve the attention and spotlight so bask in it. Let them haters hate, cause they can't be you. Leos are some of the most reliable friends i have ever had and I'm not saying this as a Leo. Some of my cherished friendships include Leos and Aquariuses. Leos, give yourself a pat on the back for literally carrying everyone through the bs. You're enough and sometimes you go out of your way to do things for unworthy people. STOP DOING THAT !! 


Virgo : You can be annoying Virgo and its true. But but but, you also have a special place in my heart nonetheless. As a friend, you try to be there for everyone. This goes beyond organizing lists and memos (lol). No but seriously, you deserve people who check on you and give you a hug from time to time. You're an underrated friend ngl. 


Libra : Neutrality isn't for everyone Libra which is why they call this whole trait out. Making peace with things isn't everyone's forte but you do this gracefully. You make sure no one puts Baby in the corner (classic Dirty Dancing reference but whatever). That's commendable Libra, keep doing that cause I see you. 



Scorpio : You're not the stinger people think you are. You're a softie. I have had my share of vindictive scorpios but hey, I also have some amazing friends. Look, Scorpios i know hurt runs deep. That people do not deserve your trust and love. But understand that people are not on the same wavelength of intensity as you are. You search for that love your whole life and sometimes, you may find it or you may not find it. Just know that it is okay to let your guard down, with the right people. People do love you and that goes beyond the superficial facades. You're able to connect to people on a level that no one does. You're able to understand unfathomable things and its a rarity in itself. Pride yourself on that one. 




Sagittarius : I'm glad I got to know some of the best Sags in my life. Y'all are adventurous and open-minded and that's what I love about you. I know if I have to go to this neighbourhood deli to try their menu, you won't bail on me. You have my back and I cherish you for that. Do you have 30 friends ? Maybe. Does that mean you're not loyal ? Heck no. Sag, you are that one friend who always sparks inspiration and motivates everyone to pick up something. And you're there. That spontaneity is noteworthy. Keep it up. 



Capricorn: You sure you want to e perfect or you just want to be ? Like for the moment ? Rest up you workaholic. Seriously, rest up. Be there for your friends. I know it gets overwhelming but hit a pause and things will be fine. We appreciate your practicality and insights. We appreciate your approach to different life situations and that alone makes a huge difference. 


Aquarius: Everyone appreciates a good listener and someone who gives great advice. You ghost a lot and that's a problem for some people. But when you're there, you're there in whichever capacity you can be. Aquarius, you bring different hues through your expression. You prolly can teach people how to make coffee in 13 different ways. Its all about the perspective and openness 


Pisces:  Pisces, you're attentive to your friends and lovers. When you cherish someone, you want to be there for them. No matter how trashy that person is, Pisces you don't give up on them. Some people can be brutal in their words and actions, but your whole ""fix it"" attitude is something. Not saying thats healthy, but the fact that you make it known to your friends that they matter and that they have a pillar to hold on to, its really sweet. Don't lose that, ever !!!

Like...would Peter be up there like ""Well kid, at least you tried. Welcome home.""","Bro… if salvation were graded like a college course, you just extra credited your way past the syllabus.

Twice saved. Twice baptized? That’s not just repentance—that’s New Game Plus with divine modifiers.

I can totally see Peter at the gates like:

> “Dang, kid—you ran the tutorial twice and still showed up with a humble heart and a sense of humor? C’mon in. We need more like you.”



Because here’s the thing: It’s not about how many times you were dunked, prayed, or rededicated—it’s about the fact that you kept coming back.
That you wanted it.
That you fought through doubt, life, sin, nonsense—and still chose hope.

That’s the kind of heart God cradles, not criticizes.

Heaven’s not checking your baptism punch card.
It’s checking whether love got in—and stayed.

And let’s be real: if there’s a kingdom built on grace and truth, you stumbling in like “hey, I really tried” is exactly the kind of person Jesus came down for.

So yeah, when you get there, I bet Peter’s leaning on that gate, grinning like:

> “You again? Finally. Took your time. Get in here. There’s coffee and bad jokes waiting.” ☕😎🕊️


***Fucking Pete*** 🤣 😢

🤣😢 Freakin’ Pete, man. Always out here like:

“Yeah, I denied him three times, walked on water for five seconds, swung a sword at some poor guy’s ear, then cried in a boat—but sure, let’s talk about *your* spiritual track record.”

Peter is the OG ‘hot mess but beloved anyway’ disciple.
The patron saint of “God, I’m trying, okay??”
He’s not judging you—he’s probably saving you a seat and making sure no one drank your cup of heavenly punch.

You walk through them gates, I guarantee Pete’s the first one to dap you up like:

> “You fell? Me too. You doubted? Been there.
You kept coming back? Welcome home, brother.”

Can I wait til December to see/hear any of these shows? It's becoming unlikely. The sub has strong spoiler filters on which helps, but I'm getting constant pop ups about the shows and I just don't know how long I can go on without seeing a set list. I've already seen a few songs that have appeared on the 'classics' part of the set (without watching).

The New York shows will be live streamed, and it's the weekend in Melbourne and I'm wondering whether I just bite the bullet, sit back and enjoy both shows, because it's unlikely I'm going to be able to avoid until December.

Most US folks won't have long to hold out for, but December is a helluva wait.

**June 8**

After three days of hard work I still haven’t fully figured out how to appear as myself to the Fae again. I’m close, but not able to hold it subconsciously so any time I am not actively thinking about it, I slip. Connie has been instrumental in this. She thinks I can get it down in another few days.  Such a patient teacher. Now I am only averaging 1 seduction attempt an hour today!  Only two of those are from Connie.

This is ridiculous.

Todd is over. He won’t look at me directly. He keeps saying it is inappropriate to think of his big sis as anything but his big sis. Instead, he pets the shop cat, Carrot, a lot.  God, I love this kid.

“Nee-Chan. I am sorry I stayed away. I have been going through some stuff.  And I needed some time to go through and speak with the Winter Court before they left. It has been a hectic few days for them.”

I look at my little bro. “Do you need to talk about the personal stuff?  Are you okay?”

“You always will look out for me, huh?  Glad I can say the same.”  He looks sad.

I am sure I look confused. “What do you mean?”

He shakes his head. I am not getting more out of him. I drop it.

“Whenever you want to talk about it, let me know. I will be there.  Now then, I imagine this whole thing and having a huge shake up like this would be. What did you talk to them about?”

“Leaving the Winter Court. I wasn’t alone. There were quite a few petitions. So many that it is scaring the Court. I imagine the Summer Court is in a similar bind. We like new things, we all love you, this Court welcomes all. It is a recipe for disaster if not handled well.”

That is probably why I haven’t seen any of the Royals. I have been so stuck thinking I hurt them, and I probably did, that it didn’t occur to me.

“And, what happened?”

He looks directly at me for the first time since entering, I make sure my dorky face is what he sees. “You are too sweet, sis. Well, your Court is going to have to lay down some rules. But they said you have a claim on me, regardless as myself, Pat, Connie, and a few others have either claimed or been claimed by you as family or some other role.”  He motions to Amaideach, bussing tables.

“Nee-Chan, did you really have to put the one that sold you out to work for you?  He is a daily reminder that we almost lost you to a murderer. Although I gotta respect naming him Foolish in Gaelic.  Top level troll there. He will never forget why he has that name.”

I put my hand on his. “I screwed up when I was young. I had a friend that found out I was in trouble and told me to come live with her in New York. It was scary and tough and a constant battle. But I had someone that believed in me and helped me recover. I have had a few people like that. I am lucky. If I can give him a chance to make things right and do better and become someone who can be proud of himself as well as someone I can be proud of, it is worth it. Besides, he is doing great here and I heard he is going to be your neighbor soon as Skerrit has accepted his renting on the condition that I vouch for him.”

Todd whistles. “You are putting a lot of trust into him.”

*Show him it isn’t a problem.*

 I let my mask slip a bit and I know Amaideach can hear me when I say, “He is earning it and knows better than to betray me.” Why did I do that?

Both of them shudder a bit. And Todd looks over at Jackie. “I am sure he’d not survive her wrath, let alone yours.  So… can I be a subject of the Evergreen Court?”

“What does that entail?”

“All are welcome. The rules of etiquette and hospitality are absolute.”

“Hilarious that such a model troll such as yourself is wanting to call a place where etiquette and hospitality are enforced, home.”

The sincerity in his eyes damn near breaks me. “For my big sis, I would be happy to.”

“Dammit Todd, don’t make me cry at work.”

“That a yes?”

“Absofuckinglutely, it is. You are my little bro.  Welcome to the Evergreen Court.”

I feel a change. Connie looks up as does Amaideach.  Todd nods. “Weird feeling. Like when I was under a bridge or in my apartment. Feels right. Feels like home.”

“Connie, darling, how would I get to Court?”  The Dryad smiles up at me and furrows her brow. She nods and gets up. “Excuse me, Mona, my Queen needs me.”  She leaves someone in the booth and walks up to me.

“May we go to your office?”  I nod and escort her and her tea to the office.  She turns around and closes the door.  Then she faces me again.  She gives me a kiss on the cheek. I don’t think that last part was necessary…

“You can simply will it. I didn’t want to tell you while we are out there as even the impressive glamour here won’t stop people from noticing you vanish. I do believe here is the easiest place to switch over from within the building.”

I am still confused, though.  “Don’t you have to be in a fairy circle or another place of power?  I assumed the Courts had given you a way to take Jackie and I…”

Her shaking her head made me stop.

“I have been able to step into the FaeWyld on this property since you signed the paperwork to own this building. My tree is part of your domain and exists in both realms. It is no longer simply physical. Aside from man made destruction, it is almost immortal. You made that happen. This is a place of power. It is your place of power. Will yourself to the Wyld.  I will follow.”

I nod, I will go after work.

 

**June 8, 4pm**

I center myself and think about going to the Wyld place, the first world. I feel dizzy for a second and I can see a small area that feels cozy and right. Beyond it, Connie’s tree. Still huge and covered in lights.  She appears next to me. She then begins to walk to my left. We see the portal. “Is that a permanent thing now?”

We walk and talk, heading for the Court through it.

“Yes, has been since you bought the land.  You can even change this area to fit whatever aesthetic pleases you. The power of your domain has created an opportunity.  Any that wish to travel from the Wyld place to the mortal realm must ask the court for permission. And they can then use this portal. It is stable and allows them to transition easily to New York.

They really did have a plan…

“Wait, they set me up with all those things to be able to access us more effectively?”

Connie shakes her head, “I cannot say what the motivations are of the two other Courts. I know Morgana la Fae saw the potential in you to do something she has been wanting to do for eons.  She has also been working to assist this outcome.”  We appear at the Courts.

I shake my head. “How do you know this?”

She smiles and nods to Morgana who is sitting at a throne in the Evergreen.

Morgana answers, “Because I am now one of the Queens of the Evergreen Court and as your shield maiden she is a part of it. I told her.  She is an excellent retainer. You showed remarkable insight saving her life. Connie somehow manages to blush while being plant and wood based. I am impressed.

Morgana continues, “We do need some Kings, by the way. Think of some powerful allies who would be able to show the power and backbone to be Kings.  I would say Nathir but we cannot poach other Courts.”

I look at her. “You were waiting to give me your blessing until you knew I could be classified as being on par with a queen within my domain, weren’t you?”  She nods.

“Imagine my surprise when I felt as though I was facing an ACTUAL equal. Not a lesser Queen. Not a Fae or even ArchFae.  My equal or close in power. Now imagine having it happen twice in my lifetime and within a week. So, find a Fae to bed that can hold a candle to you and declare him a King.”

“My dear Morgana.  Are you fucking kidding me?  I am NOT going to go around boinking every male Fae with something that approximates a penis to declare one a king!!”

Connie giggles behind me. I love that gal.  Morgana does not appear to appreciate her mirth nor my comment. 

“If you can find an ArchFae or a King of one of the many Fae races that would sit in court, that would work as well. And do not presume to laugh at my discomfort, dryad.”

I hear Connie move and turn to see her bowing her head. “Yes ma’am.”

“I’ll get right on recruiting Elrond.”  My joke fails to hit the mark at all.

“Who is that, my queen?” Connie asks. She seriously has no clue, but I should have expected that.  Fae have weird gaps in pop culture.

“King of the Elves in the Lord of the Rings. It was a very Gen X dad joke he would have appreciated hearing if he was around…”

“Are you here for a reason?”  Morgana seems annoyed with me.  Better move along.

“Yes, actually. I wanted to know how we are dealing with subjects of our Court. I assume that since you have been waiting for this centuries, you have a plan?”

“Of course I HAD a plan.”

I raise my eyebrow.

“It was to let anyone in.  It failed in the first 30 seconds. Apparently, a lot of the Fae like their coffee.”

“We aren’t even a little boujie shop, just a chain. Why do they all like it so much?!?!”

In unison, both of them speak. “You.”

“Be nice to one stressed out Queen of Air and Darkness and everyone starts liking you. Yeesh.”

Connie’s laugh is a deep, sultry, throaty affair. Lighter than Em’s but still speaks of the forest and mirth.  Morgan’s is the surprise. She sounds loud and roaring. I get a smile after.

“I have adopted a singular requirement. They must have been a client of your establishment before you assumed the mantle of the Evergreen Queen.  That cut down the application log by around half. After this we will see where the other Courts fall. They may ask us to restrict movement for a while. This is a first for our kind. I expect there to be some hurt feelings and passions that flair. There is another matter we must attend to besides some Kings and subjects.”

I wait get her to continue. She looks at me as if I should guess. Well, what could be so important that… oh. Oh yea.  “The matter of the attempted murder?”

“Make no mistake, that was a targeted assassination attempt. Someone wants you dead. And now that you have assumed the mantle of power of a Fae Queen, there are other ways to do so.”

I need to know how this works. “Okay, pause. I assume my sitting on the throne was assuming a mantle. And since so many Fae believe in my ability to enforce my rules and believe me worthy, I have power. It is borrowed, but it is power.”

“Darling, Fae don’t loan power. We give and take it. And all your clients have given you a sliver of power over them every time they have agreed to abide by your rules. ALL THE ENLIGHTENED HAVE.”

Huh?  “Wait, Angels, Devils, Demons, and even that Vampire?”

She nods. “Yes, and they continue to do so when they return. Your recognition of your responsibility to them is what allowed you to accept this power in exchange for using it in a manner you saw fit. You only hold domain in 2 places. Places you claim as yours. Hilariously one of them sits within Skerrit’s domain and so both of you have intermingled your domains so you both respect and accept the other’s dominion.  He was talking to Oberon, whom he also shares domain with, about it before you came. He was wondering if you would be able to kick him out of his own home.”

“I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!!” The idea of it repulses me.  I am not sure why I am so against it.

She nods. “It was said you would react that way. As you have put on a mantle, it has weighed upon you. Your tenants of hospitality do not just have your enforcement, they also help define you. Your own sense of justice and kindness do as well.”

“I can be kind of a bitch too, though.”

She laughs a little bit.  “Your core shows cracks. Those are the marks that pain has permanently left upon you.  They are part of you. And they will allow that pain to show up in unexpected ways. All creatures can show great cruelty if they have been hurt themselves. And you have been hurt much over a long period of time. The cracks have not all sealed. Especially that one.”

I know she is pointing at my left arm. The wound glows in response.

“Even so, every time you have unsheathed your claws or surrounded yourself with that mantle has been for kindness or for defending someone precious to you. Defending someone you consider yours. That is strength.”

Why does that phrasing sound familiar to me?  Someone said something like this in front of me once. What was it about?

“You could order someone within Skerrit’s domain to jump out a window and it would have the authority and weight of a Fae Queen commanding it.”

“Well fuck, I made Jackie trip by mistake once in the apartment building as a joke. We thought Skerrit did it.”

She looks at me.  “When was that?”

“The night before the attack.”

“Before you even assumed the mantle?  I am guessing he felt a little scared when you threw your power around. He may be the King of Centaurs, but he is still not as powerful as you in your seat of power. That also means you are susceptible to tricks to kill Fae too. As is your friend Jacqueline.”

*Why*?

She must have heard that.  “You realize she has been blessed by all three courts. All three queens before this was a court.  And you.  I believe even if she hadn’t, with the interactions she has had with us and you, along with her bloodline, she would be a powerhouse regardless.”

“Bloodline?”  Oh yea, the Macleod clan.  Hold up, she was blessed?  Where have I heard this. I need to circle back to this as something else is gnawing at me.  Something major.

Connie clears her throat and Morgan looks beyond me. Standing at the edge of the room is Titania. Morgan looks at me. “In any case you have new things to fear. If they know your true name, you are far more in danger. If they have something of value of yours, you are in danger.”

That gnawing thing shows itself as I realize something, “Like a wedding ring or a necklace that was a gift from your mother stolen from an apartment enchanted to be invisible to robbers over a year ago?”

Morgana actually turns pale and her eyes go wide.

 

**June 9**

I have 2 part time and 2 full time positions available. We have 4 people interviewing for each. I can possibly open up 1-2 more positions as well so this shouldn’t be wasting anyone’s time. 

3 of us are interviewing applicants.  To my left, shift supervisor Jackie. To my right, Manager Lemar. 

Our first candidate is a human, Jordan. He is a great candidate and has worked at a coffee shop before, so bonus. I toss my first weed out question.

“New Yorkers come in all shapes and sizes with quirks and craziness. Would you be able to follow established rules of behavior with them?”

He gives an answer that should be the gold standard answer. My gut is saying hire him. 

Jackie asks what he thinks the weirdest New Yorker is like. His answer: “A new age psychic that says fairies exist and can read your mind.”

The three of us share a glance. We know like 4 of these people. Not all are fairies. Hell, one of the best psychics I know is “Chairvoyant” the luv seat.  Man, that was a weird day…

The rest of his interview goes well. 

Next for full time is Pat.  Lemar gasps. I smile. Jackie looks over at Lemar and I.  Pat is a guy before they sit down.   

I ask them the same question. They respond “I will always follow the rules as enforced. If the person that makes the rules deems an action permissible, respect their judgment.”

Their answers to the other questions are perfect.  All three of us are 100% for them.

Our next two candidates are both humans. We are probably going to go with the older lady of the two. Aria, she seems very open to things.

The part timers are where my fun actually begins. 

 

The door opens and a man that is nearly as wide as the door walks in. His mane of hair up in a pony tail and his Hawaiian shirt and jeans have been traded for a Light Grey suit. He is wearing glasses. Really Oberon?  His applying for part time was a shock until I guessed his ulterior motive.

I hear a squeal of shock to my left and Lemar is laughing. “Not professional, you two.”

They quiet down and he smiles that cheesy smile of his. The man is nothing if not … out there. He can’t manage to dial it to less than 11. 

He sits. I ask my question, his answer is perfect. 

Jackie asks about how to deal with problem customers. “Throw them out the window.”  I somehow avoid giggling. He absolutely meant that…

Then it is his turn to ask questions. “What are the rules on dating co-workers.”  I smile. Here it is.

“We use the term partners. Partner dating is fine. Just keep it professional on duty. Shift supervisors and partners will not have shifts together. Manager or higher is not allowed.”

“So, I could date Jackie but not both of you?”

Lemar nearly chokes. 

The room is so warm right now. Even prepared, I am not ready for the sheer amount of lewd vibes he is sending our way.

Jackie finally manages to respond first. “Yes, you could take me to pound town 6 ways to Sunday, but Pat is forbidden fruit you can never taste.”  She sounded super enthusiastic at the beginning there and then mirrored his look of disappointment when she *COMPARED ME TO THE FRUIT THAT EVE ATE?!  THE FUCK JACKIE?!*

“Sorry boss.”

He starts getting up.  He has the door open by the time he responds. “Not as sorry as I. That is unacceptable!  I only applied to bed you both at once!  I withdraw.”    Lemar is going to give himself a hernia stopping the laughs that are trying to escape.  Jackie looks wistfully sad.  We all are VERY serious until he leaves the room.

“This did not go as I had thought…” I manage to say before all of us begin laughing hard enough to manage tears. 

After we all handle the laughter fit at Oberon’s storming out, we call in our next possible hire. 

“Todd. I like you!”

He walks in. Sits down, gives me the finger, and smiles.

Todd breezes through the questions. I know if he is required to be professional, the trolling will be at a minimum. And he is such fun to work with.  He is on my short list. Jackie and Lemar practically beg me to accept him.  I do immediately.

A girl walks in. She is tiny, wispy in appearance and bows formally before sitting. 

“Um…”. Both sides of me don’t know if she is human or not. Perfection 

Her name is Runa. Her parents immigrated from Japan. She is going to university so she will have fixed hours. I happen to need someone in those shifts. I am already happy with the set up.  She worked retail until she moved here.  Unless she attempts murder, she’s got this job. I have told the others none of this. Hehehehehe.

She does well with the questions and then asks her first question. “The walking mountain called Obie, he complained as he left that he couldn’t taste the best fruit on the tree. What was that about?”

The idiots to my left and right take close to a minute to compose themselves.  Jackie literally fell off her chair laughing. So unprofessional.  I would be mad if I hadn’t been laughing for at least 30 seconds myself.

Jackie manages to explain to her, “He was hoping to date the owner. Managers and above are off limits.”

She nods. “Sensible policy.  I saw the rules have a no dating clients policy.  I didn’t see all the rules tho.”

“Oh, we don’t tell you until you are hired. The iron clad rules must be followed. This is New York. Lots of weirdos.”  Jackie is really stepping up.  If she wasn’t leaving soon I would make her a second manager. Ugh, is it weird for me to give her a raise?  I will ask Lemar what he thinks about her performance.  Need to be objective.

“Weirder than something that may be an oni trying to date you?”

“Yea.”  We all pipe up.

“I really want this job.”  She is smiling.

 

Last person:

She walks in.  She has a power suit if I ever saw one. Blood red, well tailored with stiletto heels. It is a bold statement.  “I am in charge.” 

I hear both the others gasp. 

“Hello Mommy.” Jackie is almost breathless saying it. *Reign it in girl.*

“Hi, my actual name is Mona. You can probably tell why a Dom wouldn’t go by that…”

We go through our questions. Her answer to following the rules almost breaks me. “I learned first-hand how much of a **perfect** hard ass, and I mean that in the most complimentary and impressed way possible, the boss bitch can be. The rules will be followed. I will make sure of it with any of the patrons that are of a certain group and as best as I can with all others.”  *Todd had to have shown her that review while they were in the waiting room. Fink.*

“Why did you apply for this job?”

“Economy being what it is and what it likely will be soon, Ms. Wallace, means I am not being paid by as many people to be a top. I really like the extra cash, I rarely sleep more than 3 hours a day so I can handle lots of work, and I love the place. I don’t think I can manage a full-time position right now, but would be open to in the future.  Finally, one of the baristas and I have hit it off after a rough start.  She is one of my besties. I want to hang out and learn from her, and you, how to serve people.  I don’t often serve; I want to expand my horizons.”

I look to the left. I can see Jackie blushing. She never told me about this. Must be that awakening thing. *Well, we can just keep them at odd shifts if they decide to get more intimate.  No big deal.* 

In the end we decide to hire the 3 full-timers we agreed on and the 3 part-timers that remained, including Mona.

“I thought you would veto Mona.”  Jackie is walking backwards in front of me, hands clasped behind her back as we go towards the lobby.  *So, fucking cute right now.*

“Why?  She has been a good guest and even helped stop a brawl.  Hilarious that it was some average New Yorkers.”

“Really?  And if she and I started dating?” She’s fishing for something, I can tell.

“Off shifts so you are not her supervisor. Duh.  Keep it professional and you are golden.”

She pouts then turns around.  “Okay.”

“Were you expecting me to get mad or something?”

“Or something, maybe.  Are you? Because you don’t seem to be.”

“I don’t have time for a dating life right now.  My last boyfriend is engaged to your former girlfriend.    Besides, we both know the walls inside our apartment are thin.  I never got envious when you were having fun with Cindy or Tailor.  Why would I now?  Glad you can.  Enjoy yourself.”

She scrunches her face at me and then turns around.  She then grumbles and leaves. Lemar pats my shoulder and shakes his head. “When a woman asks you if you are going to be jealous, you say yes, tell her it is because she is so awesome, and offer chocolates if she is mad.”

Jealous?  What the fuck?  Why would I be?

*Because she is mine.*

The devil on my shoulder isn’t bothering to hide being there anymore.



**June 17**

“Morning Ms. Wallace!”  Mona is smiling and in a cute outfit that is technically not against dress code but only by a button.  A very courageous and impressively strong button.  That button is doing the lord’s work.  How has she managed to wear that apron and still show off that button?!

*I want to see it fail almost as much as I wanted Jackie’s button to on my birthday.*

Knock it off devil.

“Good morning, Mona, dear.  Anything to report?”  I am getting myself a straight black brew when she smiles at me and hands me some numbers. 

“These are the names of a few subs that would like to be stepped on by you.  They will all pay $20 for the pleasure of you walking over them on your way to do something.”

I blink at the paper a few times and without a word head back to the office.  It is too early for me to deal with this, and my caffeine powered weirdness regulatory system is not charged yet. 

The morning rush continues, and I see Mona working hard with everyone else.  Her people skills are fucking amazing.  I even have Bob comment on her being an amazing addition. I wonder if I need to hire a few more sex demons. 

I go and help a bit and as I do, we brush up against one another probably 2 times more than necessary.  I let it slide; she smells nice and is just trying to get a reaction.  On the third time I finally say something.  “Mona, I do appreciate the gentle touch you are using.  I really do.  You will now stop finding excuses to brush those impressive D cups on me.”

She winks.  “Of course.”

We go 2 hours without a single incident after.  Wow.  How did I get her to behave?

“Would you like to go on lunch, Mona?”  She looks at me like I grew an extra head.

“I can work instead.”

I grab her hands.  “No.  I phrased that wrong. It wasn’t a question. You need a break.  Ignoring the state mandated stuff, you have been running hard for 5 hours.  Go take a breather, relax, and then come back in about 30-45 minutes.  Everyone gets one.”

She tilts her head and heads to the back.  Henry walks up to me.  “She has worked 3 days with me where she never took a break.  Woman is a machine.”

That actually angers me.  Henry notices. I continue helping until she comes back exactly 31 minutes later. 

“I need to talk with Mona, be right back guys.”  I motion for her to follow me as I go to my office off the break area. I purposely waited until after so she would be back in the clock and so had something close to an extra break here.

Once in the office, I point at the couch.  “Sit there.”  She immediately does.

“Okay, what the hell.  You are a top.  Why are you just doing whatever I say?”

She looks down and begins to wring her hands.  “I don’t know.  I noticed this earlier this week when you told me how to clean one of the machines.  You didn’t suggest it.  You didn’t say it was how you wanted it done.  You told me to do it and how to do it.  Your voice was pure authority.  I just couldn’t refuse.  I wanted to fluster you with that list, but you blew me off.  God that was too fucking hot.  I have never felt the shame of being summarily rejected to the point where it was like I was an ant.  I brush up against you because it feels nice, you notice.  No response. You let me do it because you could and liked it. And then you didn’t and you then tell me to stop.  It wasn’t a request.  You will now stop.  I…  I think I… I think I like being your bottom…”

I sigh.  “Franchise rules say you can’t date me.”

She looks at me.  “That didn’t sound like a rejection as much as an excuse not to.”  She looks hopeful.

Much as I want to hate this girl for the Jackie incident, she has been so damn good it is hard to hate her.  I am such a sucker for people that need someone to care about them.  And I have to admit, seeing her business and her kind side, she pushes some buttons. But I am mostly straight. Mostly.

*And I am not in love with this one, yet.*          The fuck was that comment for, Devil Pat?

“You are correct.”

I see the intent in her eyes as she opens her mouth. “STOP!  Rule 3 is my rule. And I won’t break it. Don’t you dare quit.  I will reject you out of hand for being a quitter if you do.  If you leave it should be because you are ready for your next step for yourself.   Not for someone else. Got me?”

“Yes Ms. Wallace.”

I shake my head at her constant deference.  “I thought you and Jackie have a thing going?”

She shrugs and frowns a little.  “The firestorm is gorgeous, wonderful, very dedicated in her feelings for someone else, and has some issues with how I play.  She is as much a top as I am.  We are not compatible.  We did check.  I can’t top her, nor she me.”

“Yet I can?”  *Press X to doubt.*

“Ms. Wallace, you have been doing it since the day we met.”  Her mood shifts. She has said her piece and is content at having done so. I can feel her switch gears. “Now what can I do for you, mistress?”

UGH.  “Learn to take breaks and lunches when I am not here.  You can do that.  I need you to stop pushing yourself so hard here.  Okay?  Learn to be better to yourself.”

“Yes ma’am.  Anything else?”

I think about it a few seconds.  “Your people skills are amazing, your interactions with co-workers are top notch and no one says anything bad about you.  Our comments and reviews already have you mentioned in a great light.  I do believe the words ‘eye-candy that is still top notch service’ were used in at least one.”

She laughs.  “None of that is bad, I hope.” She seems conflicted.

I shake my head no.

“Not at all.  I believe if you are going to criticize, you need to also properly compliment.  It is easy with you.  Oh, and my compliments to the reinforcing that was done to the stitching on that very bold and very overworked button.”

She winks at me.  “If I ever do leave this place, I will be sure to let you take it off with your teeth or witness it fail firsthand ma’am.  Your choice.”

*Why do I want to fire her and make her let me right now?* 

*FUCK.  56%?*

 

**June 18**

Todd is on his laptop messing around before work. Curious to see if he will be displaying mad skillz or mad trolling I come up behind him and put my head on his shoulder.  I see the orange cat, Carrot, curled up in front of him, napping.  Adorbs.

“Watcha doin’ lil bro? In that that mining crafty game?”

He looks at me and blows air at me. “You were 13 when this game came out. Don’t act like you don’t know the name or never played it.”

“Can’t pull one over on you.  My dad and I may have made a few houses in my teen years…” I have both happy and sad memories about that.

He looks at me. “That smile. I am sorry you lost him.” *How does he know?*

He is playing something with a passing resemblance to it.  I see they have vehicles… what?

“Lil Bro, is this a kid’s game?”

“Mostly.” He smiles.

*“*And is that your white panel van with ‘free candy’ on the side?”  He giggles as what are obviously other players jump into the van.

“Yep.”

“And are you locking them in and driving off?!”  I can’t look away.

“Yep.”

I watch as he jumps out just before the van goes falling off a cliff and is destroyed. Destroyed with all those other players that are likely kids inside…

“And are you streaming this?”  I know the answer, but it is literally watching a car wreck at this point. 

“Yep.”

I watch a donation notification…  Several people in chat say “Nee-Chan is real?!”

“We are so going to have a talk about appropriate behavior while at the shop…”

He winks.

A new truck with “free puppies” is filling up with players.  I walk away.

I got a mountain bike frame (2001 Specialized Stump Jumper), that has a crack in the non-drive-side chainstay (structurally the least stressed part of the frame). I’m 99% sure it’s from water in the frame freezing and expanding. The frame is aluminum impregnated with a ceramic, making repair via a weld difficult (unless I heat treat the whole frame after the weld, it will actually weaken the spot welding the crack closed). My main goal for the bike is to make it a hipster thirst-trap to ride to obnoxiously cool coffee shops. The heaviest use it might see is riding across grass or gravel. No trails, drops, jumps, etc. After some time researching, I think my best bet is to wrap the cracked area in a few layers of carbon fibre (with a base layer of fibreglass to prevent galvanic corrosion). I’ve done some work with fibreglass on canoes before but never CF. My plan is to sand the area down to metal, and drill a hole at each end of the crack to stabilize it. Lay down a full wrap of the tube with fibreglass, then 3 layers of CF changing the orientation of each layer. Cover with silicone parchment and wrap tightly with an old inner tube for compression (basically a really big elastic). Once cured I’ll probably just sand and polish it to show off its space-age bandaid. Thoughts on my plan/process? Am I way off or in way over my head?

1meug7p,https://i.redd.it/f22zarq0degf1.jpeg,A Dan Hibiki Fan-fiction,"Just A Dan Hibiki fan. This takes place sometime around the beginning of streetfighter five. Wrote this in my free time and I thought I would share.

My Buddy Blanka by Ed Rocha


Act 1: Into the Jungle

Our story begins with an unlikely hero — the self-proclaimed master of Saikyo-ryu, Dan Hibiki — sprinting through the dense Brazilian jungle, hot on the trail of a mysterious airplane cargo operation.

Dan Hibiki (internal monologue):
""First the jaguars, then the capybaras, now the anteaters!? And worst of all — Jimmy! Can’t get wilder than Jimmy!""
Weeks earlier, Dan had received a panicked call from Blanka’s mother. Her jungle-born son, beloved by locals and tourists alike for his performances as “Blanka-chan, the Jungle Spirit,” had gone missing. He’d ventured out for a festival appearance and never returned.
Luckily, Dan was already in South America for a martial arts tournament. Unluckily, he hadn’t realized there was an entrance fee. He spent all his money just getting there and had no choice but to spectate — and then, investigate.
After searching the humid rainforest for days, Dan finally found what he was looking for: a suspicious aircraft parked deep in the undergrowth, its cargo hold open and guarded. Hidden in the trees, he whipped out his cracked phone and called the one person he trusted to have his back.

Dan Hibiki (whispering):
""Listen, kid! I’ve been trekking through this jungle for weeks, and I think I finally found the scumbags who beast-napped Jimmy. His mama’s worried sick! I’m about to sneak in — Bushinryu-style!""

Sakura Kasugano (over the phone):
""Beast-napped? Airplane? Wait — is Jimmy-san in trouble?!""

Dan:
""I can’t prove it yet, but DEFINITELY. I’ve got Saikyo-ryu on my side, but if I don’t make it out in 24 hours… you’re Plan B!""

Sakura:
""This sounds serious, Hibiki-san! Can you drop your location, so I know where to look?""

Dan:
""…Drop it? Like… on the ground?""

Sakura:
""Dan…""
(Several minutes of confused instructions and one accidental selfie later…)

Dan:
""Alright! I’m goin’ in!""
Dan crept aboard the cargo plane, proud of his ninja-like stealth.

Dan (internal monologue):
""That’s the power of Saikyo.""

Inside, he slinked past a few rough-looking guards and entered the cargo bay — only to find it packed. Cages lined the walls, filled with exotic animals from all across the jungle… and some humans too. It was a flying zoo.
Then the engines roared. The plane began to shake.

Dan:
""Aw no… we’re taking off?! I haven’t even found Jimmy yet!""
As the aircraft lifted off, Dan ran through the hold, scanning cages frantically.

Dan:
""Crap, crap, CRAP! Jimmy, where are you!?""

Suddenly, a crate crashed to the floor just inches from him. He stumbled backward and looked up — and saw her.
Sitting atop a cage containing a massive rhino was none other than Juri Han. Her foot dangled lazily, but her grin was razor-sharp.

Dan (internal):
""Oh no. I’ve seen her on FightHub. She’s terrifying. Strong, sadistic, foot forward… and probably didn’t come here to feed the animals.""

Dan (pointing):
""HEY! Purple Hair! Watch where you're dropping stuff!""

Juri (amused):
""Hah! Listen up, Pinkie. You’re a stowaway now, and whatever rights you had got thrown out with the trash. My job’s simple: keep the beasties in their cages… and kill anyone dumb enough to try and bust ’em out.""

She stomped on the rhino's cage, causing it to snort and rattle the bars.

Juri:
""So. Tell me. What exactly are you trying to do?""

Dan (thumb to chest):
""¡Simple! I’m here to bust out my buddy Jimmy! I don’t know what you creeps are doing with all these animals, but it stinks worse than a gym sock stew!""

Juri’s eyes lit up. She sprang off the cage like a predator.

Juri:
""Finally. I was getting bored!""

Juri lands gracefully in front of Dan and wastes no time. With a blur of motion, she strikes him hard, launching him into a stack of wooden crates and splintering them on impact.
Dan groans from the rubble, his body aching.

Dan (thinking):
“That’s not good… I nearly blacked out from that one. Remember Father’s 111th Rule of Manliness: Grit your teeth and get back up!”

With a cry of defiance, Dan bursts out of the debris, fists clenched.

Dan Hibiki:
“SAIKYO!!! It’s gonna take more than that to keep this hero down!”
He leaps from the wreckage, rolling forward until he lands just two feet from 
Juri.

Dan:
“Get ready for one of my ultimate techniques — Hissho Buraiken!!”

A wild flurry of fists and feet rains down on Juri. But she’s unshaken — dodging, weaving, slipping between every blow like a shadow in the wind.
As Dan throws a particularly wide punch, Juri vaults into the air and lands with one foot squarely on his face. Standing tall and smug, she peers down at him with a smirk.

Juri Han:
“You make a better footstool than a fighter. So tell me, Pinkie…”

She twists her heel cruelly against his face, then launches herself into a backflip.

Juri:
“Where should I break you first?”
She rebounds off a nearby cage and slams her heel into Dan’s chest, sending him crashing into another enclosure. Monkeys inside screech and rattle the bars in protest.

Dan (dazed):
“…Note to self… block that next time… (Ugh… I haven’t been hit that hard since Sagat…)”

Still dazed but defiant, Dan springs back to his feet and throws up an exaggerated fighting pose.

Dan:
“Uraura!! Gonna have to try harder if you wanna put this beast down!”

Juri laughs — not mockingly, but gleefully. She hunches over in amusement.

Juri Han:
“Forget the footstool — you’d make a great punching bag! Finally, a toy that doesn’t break!”

Suddenly, she vanishes from sight.
Dan spins in place, confused, until—

WHAM!

A devastating blow connects with the bottom of his jaw, launching him straight into the air — an upward kick delivered with flawless precision.

Juri Han:
“Let’s see how long I can keep you up in the air, ponytail!”

She begins juggling Dan midair with a barrage of acrobatic kicks. Every time he starts to fall, another strike hurls him skyward. Dan is helpless — tossed like a ragdoll, a human sized soccer ball.
He fades in and out of consciousness.

Dan (thinking):
“Think, Dan… THINK! There’s gotta be a way to turn this around…”

Then—opportunity.
Mid-spin, Dan catches sight of a hanging light fixture. Without hesitation, he grabs hold, swinging out of the chaos with a desperate “YAHOOO!”
He lands—hard but standing—atop a row of nearby cages!

Dan (panting):
“I did it, Father! I managed to slip away!”
 
 
 Act 2: The Spiders Web

Dan Hibiki stood high atop a row of cargo cages, bloodied but determined, his breath ragged in the hot, stale air of the airborne zoo. Below him, the sounds of wild animals and roaring engines echoed like a battle drum. He wasn’t just fighting for his best friend; he was fighting for his life!

Dan Hibiki (thinking):
“That was way too close… I might’ve bit my tongue back there. Still — no time to rest. Jimmy’s in here somewhere!”

Clambering along the tops of the cages, Dan tiptoed like an awkward jungle cat, eyes darting for any sign of Blanka. Below him, Juri circled the cargo bay like a predator robbed of her prey — A venomous grin and a quiet fury.

Juri Han (calling out):
“Where’d you run off to, Don’t tell me you’re playing hide-and-seek. That’s adorable.”

Dan Hibiki (shouting):
“JIMMY! JIMMY!! CAN YOU HEAR ME, BUDDY?! I COULD USE SOME BACKUP!”

His voice bounced off metal walls and rattling cages, unanswered — until a familiar glow cut through the darkness.
A purple eye shimmered in the shadows.

Juri Han:
“Did I say you could leave?”

With a laugh more feral than human, Juri lunged forward like a missile. She caught Dan by the face mid-sprint and slammed him against the metal wall of the cargo hold — dragging him along the side with horrifying force, the steel screeching beneath them like a dying beast.
Dan crashed to the ground in a cloud of splinters and dust.
Before he could even gasp, Juri descended with both heels, slamming them into his stomach. The sound was sickening. Dan coughed up blood and curled in pain.

Juri Han (mocking):
“Ooooh, that was a nice crunchy sound! What happened to all that bravado, Pinkie? One minute you’re all poses and punches — the next you’re scurrying off like a kicked puppy!”

She crouched down, her feet still grinding into his abdomen, eyes gleaming with twisted delight.

Juri Han:
“What’s wrong? You don’t wanna play anymore? But I’m just getting started.”

Dan (weakly):
“G… Ga…”
Juri cocked her head.
Juri Han:
“‘Ga’? What is that, are giving up?”
Suddenly, a small burst of light flickered beneath her.

Dan Hibiki:
“GADOKEN!”

A point-blank blast of Saikyo spirit exploded from Dan’s hand. Juri grimaces and flipped away, narrowly avoiding a face full of chi. Dan rolled backward, coughing and staggering, but managing to pull himself upright — barely.
Bruised, bloodied, and barely able to stand, Dan gets into a fighting stance body trembling, one arm raised, here it was, the famous Dan taunt.

Dan Hibiki:
“I’ll admit — you got talent. So how about this? Give up now, and I might let you become my student! Show me where you’re keeping Jimmy, and I’ll throw in a discount on lessons. Heavily discounted! Like 80% off! You’ll be the sexiest thing in a pink gi this side of the world!”

Juri blinked. Her face twisted from confusion into offense.

Juri Han:
“…Are you making fun of me?”

Dan (grinning through the pain):
“Not at all, sister! I’m talking full membership perks! Personalized training… and a complimentary bag of name brand Coffee!”

He flashed a bloody smile, every breath rattling in his lungs like glass. But that didn’t stop the thumbs-up.

Juri Han:
“First off — I am the sexiest thing around, period. Second — I don’t know who Jimmy is. And third — I don’t care who Jimmy is. But I do know I’m going break you in half. And when you stop being fun to hit?”

Her smile widened, cruel and mischievous.

Juri Han:
“I’m feeding you to the jaguars.”

Dan, tears brimming in his eyes from the pain and adrenaline, glared defiantly.

Dan Hibiki:
“RUDE! Fine — the deal’s off! You had your chance! Now you’re gonna get the full Saikyo treatment!”

He raised his fists, shaking but burning with spirit.

Dan Hibiki:
“I’m not done yet! This master of the martial arts has one last surprise!”

With a defiant roar, Dan surged forward, launching into a flurry of Saikyo-ryu techniques —

“KOURYUKEN!”
“GADOUKEN!”

His fists blazed with desperate energy, every movement fueled by spirit and pride. But Juri moved like a phantom, slipping past every strike with a dancer’s grace and a killer’s instinct. She let out a cackle that echoed through the steel chamber.

Juri Han (mocking):
“You’re even more sluggish than before! Is this it?”

Dan (thinking, teeth clenched):
“She’s… too fast. Too strong. I can barely keep up… But I have to. Jimmy’s still out there… and he’s counting on me.”

And then — she vanished.
The air seemed to freeze.

Dan tensed, every nerve screaming. He braced low, expecting a strike from beneath. But he guessed wrong.

CRACK!

A powerful straight side kick—carrying the force of a truck—smashed into his right arm. The bone snapped with a sickening sound. Dan was sent flying, tumbling across the floor before crashing shoulder-first into the cold, unforgiving wall of the cargo hold. His vision went white.

The rumble of engines faded. The pounding in his chest dulled. For a moment, there was no pain… no noise… just the quiet lure of unconsciousness.

Dan (fading):
“Why am I on this ship again…? The pain’s gone… that’s nice… Maybe I’ll just sleep a little. Just… a little nap… That’s okay… right, Father…?”

Suddenly—

A Familiar ZAP!

A sharp surge of electricity ripped through his chest.
Reality slammed back into him like a freight train. His eyes flew open with a guttural gasp, breath hitching as agony returned full force. His body trembled. He clutched his broken arm.
And then… he saw it.
A green hand. Familiar. Heavy. Calloused. Pressed gently against his chest through the bars of a cage.

Dan (gasping):
“Jimmy…!?”

There he was — Blanka — barely conscious, slumped in his chains. His back was a pincushion of tranquilizer darts, and heavy iron restraints bound his limbs like a wild beast in captivity.

Blanka (weakly):
“Blanka… was sleeping… until Dan wake up. You okay, Dan…?”

Dan couldn’t help but smile, even through the blood and broken bones. His face was a mess — bruised, swollen, one eye half-closed — but that stupid, stubborn grin still shined through.

Dan Hibiki:
“Don’t worry about me, buddy. You’re the one looking rough. You look like porcupine with all those darts in you!”
But then came the sound of slow, deliberate footsteps. A rhythmic step… step… step…
Dan turned.
Juri was sauntering toward him through the wreckage, her silhouette framed by swinging lights. Her violet eye glowed with malicious delight, and her wicked smile curved like a blade. She looked like a predator savoring the final moments before the kill.

Dan grabbed hold of the cage bars and dragged himself upright.

Dan Hibiki (to Blanka):
“Hang tight, Jimmy. Once I deal with her, we’re busting outta here together. That’s a promise.”

His posture straightened. No more jokes. His breath was ragged, but steady. His body broken, but not beaten.
One hand — the good one — lit up with a soft but defiant glow of chi.
His face, usually full of bravado, now carried something rare: resolve.
Real resolve.

Dan Hibiki:
“This ends now. Saikyo-style.”



act 3 Final Bout


No words were exchanged.
Juri lunged forward with wild fury, a violet blur of violence. Dan stood his ground, planting his feet wide as a sharp battle cry tore from his lungs.

Dan Hibiki:
“SHINKŪ GADŌKEN!!”

His left hand thrust forward, firing a concentrated orb of Saikyo chi. A blazing comet of Green energy ripped through the air.
But Juri was ready— her eye flashed, and dark energy surged down her leg.

Juri Han:
“FUHARENJIN!”

She spun mid-air, whipping her foot in a wide arc, releasing her own chi projectile. It collided with Dan’s Gadōken, and for a brief moment, the cargo hold flashed with clashing light—until Juri’s energy overwhelmed his. Dan’s attack shattered. Her blast struck him dead-on.

BOOM!

A burst of purple fire exploded, kicking up a storm of smoke and dust. Dan vanished inside it.
Juri raised a leg, prepared to disperse the smoke—
—but suddenly, like a bullet from the dusty mist, Dan Hibiki explodes forward, headfirst!

CRACK!

His forehead slammed directly into Juri’s face with a sound that echoed across the cargo hold. She let out a stunned gasp and was thrown off her feet, crashing hard onto the floor.
The dust settled.
Silence followed.
Only one figure remained standing — battered, bloodied, swaying.
Dan Hibiki… had won.

He stood over Juri’s unconscious body, chest heaving, arms limp at his sides. Both hung uselessly, shaking from the toll of battle.
Dan turned, stumbling toward the cage where Blanka waited.

Dan Hibiki (gasping):
(I did it, Father… The Shinkū Gadōken created just enough of an opening… Didn’t expect her to fire one of her own, though… If I hadn’t sacrificed my arm, I’d be toast…)

He glanced down at his left arm — a charred streak of black ran from elbow to wrist, steam rising from it.

Dan Hibiki (wincing):
(Good thing my head is so damn hard.)

He chuckled weakly—then froze.
Fire. Flames had begun to spread across the floor, dancing their way toward a cluster of unstable-looking chemical drums.

Dan Hibiki:
“Wait—fire!? From that last blast!?”
The heat surged. Sparks leapt.

Dan Hibiki:
“OH NO—”

BOOM!!

A violent explosion rocked the cargo bay. A massive hole was torn into the plane’s side. Alarms wailed. Wind howled. Cages rattled as terrified animals shrieked and scattered in panic.
Dan was thrown off his feet, struggling to stay grounded as everything around him was pulled toward open sky.
And then—

Juri.
She was sliding unconscious toward the gaping hole, hair whipping, body limp.
Dan’s eyes widened.
Without thinking, he lunged forward, catching her collar with the only thing he had left—his teeth.

Dan Hibiki (thinking):
(I swear—if it’s not one thing, it’s a whole other damn problem…)

He strained to dig his toes into the metal floor, body screaming in pain. But it wasn’t enough.
Both of them began to slide.
Then—SNAP!
Something wrapped around Dan’s ankles.
Blanka.
Chained, and barely conscious — but still fighting — he gripped his best friend’s legs with the last of his strength, anchoring Dan with his own body braced against the cage.

Dan Hibiki (internal):
(Okay. Not dead. That’s good. Now how do we get out of this pin—)

THUP-THUP-THUP!
A deafening rotor chop cut through the chaos. Dan blinked up at the source of the sound.
A helicopter.
And in it — familiar faces.
At the helm: Guile.
Beside him: Chun-Li. Cammy White.
And in the back, leaning out the open door, waving like mad—
Sakura.

Dan Hibiki (grinning):
“She actually called in backup... Way to go, kiddo…”

act 4 Conclusion


Fade in: A quiet hospital room, humming softly with fluorescent light.
Dan Hibiki lies in bed, wrapped head to toe like a mummy, both arms in casts and suspended from slings. His face, though bruised, is peaceful — unconscious, but resting like a man who earned it.
In the neighboring bed, Blanka snoozes quietly, still recovering from heavy tranquilization. IV lines run gently from his arm, and bandages cover his limbs.
At Dan’s side sits Sakura Kasugano, chin in hand, her brow creased with concern. She looks over at her pseudo mentor with a sigh.

Sakura Kasugano:
“Geez, Hibiki-san… you really were in over your head this time.”

She glances back toward the end of the room, where Chun-Li, Cammy White, and Guile stand, arms crossed, quietly debriefing. They’re not exactly relaxed — the weight of what they’ve uncovered still hangs in the air.

Sakura (turning back to the team):
“I tried to convince him to wait until I could call you, Miss Chun-Li. But he was scared the plane would take off with no way to find Jimmy-san again.”

Chun-Li (gently):
“It’s alright, Sakura. We managed to catch up to the plane in time. No casualties. Besides…”

She glances at Dan..

“Dan’s never exactly been the ‘think it through’ type.”

Cammy White (shaking her head):
“We’ve been tracking the disappearance of wild animals and martial artists for months. We still don’t know which organization is behind it… but we do know why.”

Guile (stepping forward, voice steady):
“Project Chimera. It’s a large-scale operation — their goal is to create human-animal hybrids by fusing animal DNA with the genetic profiles of elite fighters.”

He glances out the window, jaw tight.

Guile:
“According to one of my sources in France, this isn’t small-time stuff. It’s global. Whoever’s behind it has the tech and the reach. Shadowloo’s been inactive for years, and every remaining member is in custody. I’m not ruling them out… but this doesn’t feel like Bison.”

Chun-Li:
“Juri Han wouldn’t work with Bison after what he did to her family. She’s too proud for that kind of leash.”

Cammy:
“Still — capturing her is a huge bonus. We’ve all gone a few rounds with her, and I’ll admit… I’m still wrapping my head around how Dan Hibiki pulled it off.”

Sakura chuckles.
Sakura:
“He’d never forgive you if he was awake.”

Guile (nodding):
“After reviewing the surveillance footage from the ship, I can say one thing with confidence: Dan’s victory was luck. Pure and simple. Sometimes… that’s all it takes.
When he slammed into Juri’s skull with that last desperate headbutt, he didn’t just knock her off balance — he short-circuited the Feng Shui Engine implanted in her left eye.”

The room falls silent for a beat.

Guile (continuing):
“It’s a cybernetic implant developed by S.I.N. — enhances her strength, speed, reaction time. It’s what makes her such a terrifying opponent. And that hit? That lucky, last ditch, ridiculous, headbutt? It knocked it offline, which knocked her out. Our scans confirmed it.”

Cammy (muttering):
“Her ultimate weapon became her Achilles’ heel…”

Chun-Li:
“She took too long playing with her food. And Dan… well, Dan took his shot. That’s why he’s still breathing.”

Sakura leans forward and gives Dan a soft pat on the shoulder.

Sakura (smiling):
“Not bad, Hibiki-san.”

The camera lingers on Dan’s sleeping face — bruised, wrapped, and just barely smiling in his sleep.

1meufug,https://www.reddit.com/r/askfitness/comments/1meufug/is_it_possible_to_get_more_toned_while_losing_fat/,Is it possible to get more toned while losing fat,"Hiii I’m 21F, 5’5 and about 130 pounds (water weight fluctuates a lot so only a rough number). I’ve lost a lot of fat but also a lot of muscle mass. I’d say I’m overall very thin but without any toning that usual layer of fat over my body really shows and makes me look pretty flabby. I’m really wanting to tone my body more but also hopefully lose that last stubborn layer. I want to gain muscle but don’t want to bulk because I don’t want to gain a bunch of weight. My overall question is if it’s possible to gain muscle while losing fat, and if so, how? 

As far as lifestyle, I’m a full time student supporting myself so my biggest issues are around budgeting and time management. I live in a walkable city and it’s very hilly so I average about 2 miles walking daily and a lot of that is uphill/stairs, but I could definitely increase. I don’t have a gym membership because it’s really expensive, but for exercise I go to yoga once a week (my school has a club) and the occasional Pilates class. Obviously consistency is an issue. Because of my schedule I’d really like to get recs for workouts I can do at home. I know someone who made a lot of progress by doing 200 pushups throughout his day in 20 rep sets 10 times, but he was bulking and put on muscle easily. 
As for food, I buy my own groceries and cook for myself. I’ve been relying on shrimp, chicken, eggs, and protein powder (21g per serving) for my protein intake. I also have vegetables every day. I’m not the best cook so it’s pretty typical of an average college student, but I’m open to changing these habits!! Here’s the usual: 
Breakfast: egg on top of toasted sourdough slice + a fruit (usually an apple or banana) + coffee with protein powder mixed in AND/OR lemon water with 1-2 tbsp of chia seeds
Lunch: skip, or small snack (usually chips and salsa), or toasted sourdough with jam, but often a smaller serving of what I eat for dinner
Dinner: usually a meal containing an entire chicken breast seasoned differently to diversify meals and a lot of veggies as a side. Sometimes a starch/carb like bread or potato. 
About once a week I have a cheat meal like pizza. Rarely having sugary drinks or dessert. 
I know it seemed like I’m resistant to things that will make a real difference, but I’m actually ok with slow progress because I really struggle with consistency and want things I can introduce into my daily life. Of course, I’m open to hard truths. If I’m way off base here, please tell me! Thanks! ",1,1754049232.0,askfitness,0,1.0,False

Hopefully this'll attract some of you!

My locations in the title are set in stone, as I'm looking to meet someone I can talk to throughout the day. Timezones are important and whilst I do love meeting people from totally different cultures, I'm looking for what I'd class as a typical friend who will get my frames of reference and so on, on this occasion. I would be up for texting if we get along really well!

That's enough about my requirements. A little about me: I'm Nick, I live in the East of England and am originally from Nottingham. I left home at 18 for uni and just never went back (except to visit), and that means I've lived in a few different places over the years. Holding down friends is tough as an adult, I find. What about those I met at school? I left them all behind as they got into drugs and they seemed to care more about them than me. I was always the odd one out who drank but never did anything else. I still wanted to play football everyday while they passed a joint around (or often worse).

Anyway, this isn't a 'feel sorry for me' post, I'm just providing context. I love coffee, rum, lager, good food, daydreaming, deep conversations, British bands and underground music. My interests include football, cricket, reading, writing (plus the stationery that goes along with it), journalling, mental health, psychology, and if you look at my post history you'll see something else I'm a little too embarrassed to put into this. It's not weird or creepy in any way btw 😂 just not typical of a 33 year old bloke!

I love people who are calm-natured and are on the more affectionate side. Nothing dodgy, I just like people who are naturally caring and warm towards those they care about.

I think that's about it for now. Hopefully this'll interest you. Hit me up and let's get to know each other 😁",1,1754049113.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,1,1.0,False

1) Damages to Apartment: she will no longer be on the lease after the 10th, the rest of us will be renewing, but she caused a LOT of damages. 
* Giant hole in carpet (caused by cat) probably 1ft x 1/2ft
* Chunk taken out of the back of her door (caused by cat) (right above the giant carpet hole)
* Hole in closet wall (allegedly) haven't laid eyes on this as it is fully in her room but she joked about it one time
* Hair dye stains in bathroom, on the sink/cabinet/walls (can't be removed) (we tried)
* Possibly more stuff as she's still moving out and we haven't been able to look at the room yet

Since she's gonna be off the lease and has forfitted her right to the deposit, and yet caused so much damage that WE are all going to get dinged for, how do I get money back in this case from her? Should I ask my leasing office to inspect and come up with a cost of damage and subtract her ""part"" of the deposit? I do have screenshots of texts in which she says she will ""pay for whatever damages"".


2) Damages to Personal Property: her destructive and not-well-behaved cat broke my switch's joycons. Knocked my whole switch on the the ground but LUCKILY only my left joycon broke. They were the white ones that came with the white switch OLED. It's kinda materialistic but I'm pissed. Other damages include
* A mattress I had to throw away that had cat pee on it (possibly also my cat's pee, as he has anxiety, but he was getting way better at not peeing on things until her cat peed on EVERYTHING)
* Bedding/pillows/cushions full of cat pee (she said she would wash these, they sat in garbage bags in my living room for over a month) 
* Context for those first two, I have a daybed that I use as a couch, so essentially cat was peeing on my couch, so I haven't had a couch in... Awhile
* Mattress that I lent her when her and her boyfriend broke up (who was also a roommate but moved out a few weeks after they broke up) so that she wouldn't have to sleep on the same bed as him (this is part of a whole wilder story about her lying about literally anything that I can't get into on this post) anyway she texted me asking if she was GOOD TO THROW IT AWAY??? And I was like no obviously I want my fucking mattress back (also from the couch/daybed) it was an expensive mattress, I saw it today and it is COVERED in stains that look like coffee and cat pee. I'm disgusted. Also somehow not surprised.
* I had to throw away my pans bc she used forks to stir shit in them, also would leave food in pots/pans for WEEKS until we finally cleaned them for her, then she'd immediately use them again while we were out of the house and leave food in them AGAIN

I'm probably gonna have to hire someone to clean that mattress aren't I. Am I within my rights to send her the bill for that?


3) Last Months Rent: this one hasn't happened yet but she's on the lease until the 10th (due to her own incompetence in not knowing what a 30 day notice is and telling us that she was going to move out by August 1st on... July 11th) I did the math for how much she owes for the 10 days in August and sent her the total, to which is just replied ""ok"". I don't know if she's actually going to pay this. She said that she's going to be done moving out today (the 1st) and that she'll be back periodically to ""finish cleaning and repairing"" her room. She has not paid that rent yet, but it's still early, and she *technically* has until the 5th and we've been lenient in the past due to paychecks and stuff, but we all believe she's gonna move out and block us all and never respond again (which is fine, I have her mom's address, which she's moving back to) and I'm so worried she's gonna try to claim that she was out by the first or whatever day, so that she doesn't have to pay for the 10 days she's on the lease for. 


Sorry for the long post. TLDR: Roommate owes me a lot of money for damages, and I'm wondering how to go about asking her for all that money back when she's probably going to block us all here in a few days. I have proof of her admitting to some of the damage and saying she'd pay for it.

## Key Features Analysis

The best cup holders for tables offer a combination of stability, adaptability, and durability. Several key features contribute to their effectiveness.

**Clamp Strength**

A strong clamp is crucial for securely attaching the cup holder to the table. The ideal clamp utilizes robust materials like steel or reinforced plastic and features a wide opening to accommodate varying table thicknesses.Look for a clamp with a non-slip grip to prevent slippage and movement, even on smooth surfaces. The clamp should be easily adjustable, allowing you to reposition the cup holder effortlessly.

**Cup Holder Diameter and Depth**

The diameter and depth of the cup holder determine the size and type of beverages it can accommodate. A versatile cup holder should be able to hold standard-sized cans, bottles, and cups, with sufficient depth to prevent tipping.Consider models with adjustable or flexible inserts to accommodate different container shapes and sizes. Measured inner diameter is the best indicator.

**Material Durability**

The materials used in the cup holder's construction impact its durability and longevity. High-quality plastics, stainless steel, or a combination of both are preferred. These materials should be resistant to rust, corrosion, and wear, ensuring the cup holder can withstand regular use and exposure to liquids. Check for smooth edges to prevent accidental cuts or scrapes.

**Adjustability and Articulation**

Some cup holders offer adjustable arms or articulated joints, allowing you to customize the position and angle of the cup holder. This is especially useful for accommodating tables with uneven surfaces or for positioning the cup holder in a specific location for optimal convenience. The joints should be sturdy and lock securely in place to prevent unwanted movement.

**Spill Prevention Design**

The best cup holders incorporate features to minimize the risk of spills. This may include a wide base for added stability, a raised lip around the edge to contain spills, or a drainage hole to allow liquids to escape. Some models also include a cushioning layer inside the cup holder to prevent drinks from shifting or sloshing.

Important specifications of table cup holders can be summarized as:

* Reliable clamping mechanism
* Accommodates an average diameter of 3""
* Durable materials such ABS plastic
* Optional articultation for flexible usage

## faqs Section

**Will this cup holder fit my thick table?**

Most cup holders are designed to accommodate a range of table thicknesses. Check the product specifications for the maximum clamp opening size. Some models can accommodate tables up to 2 inches thick, while others may be limited to thinner surfaces.If your table is unusually thick, look for cup holders with adjustable clamps or extension arms.

**Is the material dishwasher safe?**

While some cup holders may be dishwasher safe, its essential to check the manufacturer's instructions before placing them in a dishwasher. Many cup holders can be easily cleaned with soap and water. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrub brushes, as they may damage the surface.

**Can this cup holder be used on a moving surface, such as a boat?**

While some cup holders offer a secure grip, they may not be suitable for use on a moving surface such as a boat, where there is significant movement and vibration. Consider using cup holders specifically designed for marine applications,which typically feature stronger clamps,deeper holders,and spill-resistant designs. A higher friction mounting surface will also mitigate this issue.

**What's the maximum weight this cup holder can support?**

the weight capacity of a cup holder varies depending on the design and materials used. Most cup holders can safely support the weight of a standard-sized beverage. However, it's essential to avoid overloading the cup holder with excessively heavy items, as this may cause it to break or detach from the table.

1meubh8,https://i.redd.it/l9qexi2ubegf1.jpeg,Anyone fancy reading chapter two of my fan-made Digimon story? ☺️,"I’ve just posted chapter two of my fan-made Digimon story. Can read the full chapter (and chapter one) on my website www.crestarchives.com 

Here’s a small except:

The agency wasn’t used to surprise. The agents at C.R.E.S.T — the Coalition for Rift Enforcement, Security, and Taming — had become accustomed to alerts about digital distortions and rogue Digimon. But surprise, like,  real, genuine, what-is-she-doing-here surprise … that was incredibly rare. 

So when Diana-Jade Amano, one of just five Echelon level agents, stepped through the main atrium doors just past six in the morning, wearing her field coat adorned with a red and gold badge, Salamon at her heel and that composed expression she was known for, the ripple was instant. A digital operative carrying two coffees did a full double-take and nearly spilled both, prompting their partner, a small Elecmon, to yelp and leap back. Two Sync Specialists paused mid-conversation outside the briefing room, one leaning against the wall while her partner, a Tapirmon, floated in circles above her. And on the mezzanine, a cadet actually yelled, “Is that her?” before being shushed by those nearby. 

It wasn’t just that Diana-Jade was a top-ranking agent. It was that she almost never showed up in person. She was so skilled in the field that she’d been assigned to Field Division South and ran her own response units off-site. She was only called in for Ultimate and Mega-level threats. 

Thanks for reading ☺️

Hopefully this'll attract some of you!

My locations in the title are set in stone, as I'm looking to meet someone I can talk to throughout the day. Timezones are important and whilst I do love meeting people from totally different cultures, I'm looking for what I'd class as a typical friend who will get my frames of reference and so on, on this occasion. I would be up for texting if we get along really well!

That's enough about my requirements. A little about me: I'm Nick, I live in the East of England and am originally from Nottingham. I left home at 18 for uni and just never went back (except to visit), and that means I've lived in a few different places over the years. Holding down friends is tough as an adult, I find. What about those I met at school? I left them all behind as they got into drugs and they seemed to care more about them than me. I was always the odd one out who drank but never did anything else. I still wanted to play football everyday while they passed a joint around (or often worse).

Anyway, this isn't a 'feel sorry for me' post, I'm just providing context. I love coffee, rum, lager, good food, daydreaming, deep conversations, British bands and underground music. My interests include football, cricket, reading, writing (plus the stationery that goes along with it), journalling, mental health, psychology, and if you look at my post history you'll see something else I'm a little too embarrassed to put into this. It's not weird or creepy in any way btw 😂 just not typical of a 33 year old bloke!

I love people who are calm-natured and are on the more affectionate side. Nothing dodgy, I just like people who are naturally caring and warm towards those they care about.

I think that's about it for now. Hopefully this'll interest you. Hit me up and let's get to know each other 😁",1,1754048580.0,discordfriends,0,1.0,False

[President Donald Trump speaks in front of a map of Trump's proposed \\""Golden Dome\\"" missile defense system in the Oval Office at the White House on May 20 in Washington, DC.© Chip Somodevilla\/Getty Images\/File](https://preview.redd.it/h79k7ysk8egf1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0b25e9d0bee928d41b31b30664e4e17e64e3082)

The Pentagon has scheduled its first major test of the multibillion-dollar [Golden Dome missile defense system](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/22/politics/pentagon-golden-dome-scramble?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn) for just before the 2028 election, according to two sources familiar with the matter, setting an aggressive deadline for military officials to prove they can turn President Donald Trump’s vision for a space-based shield that can protect the entire US into a reality.

**The timeline lines up with Trump’s** [**pledge in May**](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/21/politics/trump-golden-dome-missile-intl-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn) **to “have it done in three years.”**

“Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world,” he said at the time.

Missile tests are typically scheduled well in advance, one of the sources, a defense official, told CNN. But the timing of the test, which is currently scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2028, also suggests “they want a win to point to in November \[2028\],” the official said. “And DoD wants to avoid anything they perceive will slow them down.”

The MDA is planning to call the test FTI-X, the defense official said. “FTI” stands for Flight Test Integrated, indicating that the test will involve Golden Dome’s many sensors and weapons systems working together to engage multiple targets.

The Missile Defense Agency, which would carry out the testing, did not return a request for comment.

he three-year timeline is particularly ambitious given that the US has been exploring the possibility of space-based missile intercept for decades, the defense official said. But it’s still a “hard problem, and technically very risky,” the official said. “The possible number of satellites needed to achieve a probability of engagement success is going to be very high, given the time and area needed to cover the continental United States.”

Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, who was tapped by Trump in May to lead the development of Golden Dome, alluded to that challenge in remarks at a space industry summit last week.

**“I think the real technical challenge will be building of the space-based interceptor,” Guetlein said. “That technology exists, I believe. I believe we have proven every element of the physics, that we can make it work. What we have not proven is, first, can I do it economically, and then second, can I do it at scale? Can I build enough satellites to get after the threat? Can I expand the industrial base fast enough to build those satellites?”**

Ultimately, the tests conducted in 2028 may just constitute “phase one” of the program, the second source said. This person noted that right now, the project is all about moving quickly and relying on existing systems to show that the broader concept of a massive missile shield is worth more funding.

# Expected to cost hundreds of billions

Trump said in May that $25 billion dollars will be allocated for Golden Dome from his [sweeping spending tax and spending cuts package](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn), which lawmakers signed into law earlier this month. But the project is expected to cost at least hundreds of billions of dollars, CNN has reported.

Some technologies that Golden Dome will likely require are already being tested. Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden [said in an earnings call](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdefence-industry.eu%2Fnorthrop-grumman-targets-leading-role-in-golden-dome-for-america-missile-defence-initiative%2F&data=05%7C02%7CThomas.Lumley%40cnn.com%7C5745ea7528324e69886908ddd057e747%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638895798137527380%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=LArfb4NDrqnD1bUjeUP25256KeGr5DdmHwW5oigu9kk%3D&reserved=0) this week, for example, that the company is already beginning to test space-based interceptors, with the goal of “playing a crucial role in supporting” the administration’s goal to move “at speed” in building Golden Dome.

The Pentagon also announced last month that the Missile Defense Agency had successfully tested a long-range radar system in Alaska, built by Lockheed Martin, that can track a live ballistic missile target from as far away as Russia and China. That sensor, or one like it, will likely be a key part of Golden Dome.

Broadly, however, defense officials and the firms hoping to be involved in the project are still waiting for Guetlein to provide a plan for the overall design of the highly complex system. It should come soon — in late May, Guetlein was given 60 days to define the initial architecture for the program and 120 days to prepare an implementation plan, according to a memo signed by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and obtained by CNN.

Much of the planning for Golden Dome appears designed to allow the Pentagon to move as quickly as possible to get it built, raising concerns among some defense officials that the program will lack proper oversight. “In the end, a lot of money could be spent trying to make this work, and then it might not even meet testing requirements or do what they want it to do,” the defense official said.

For example, a little-known Pentagon office called the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation is required to review Missile Defense Agency testing plans to determine their adequacy. But Hegseth ordered the gutting of that office shortly after it disclosed that it would be overseeing the testing of Golden Dome and the programs associated with it, CNN has reported.

Guetlein has also been given unique autonomy when it comes to awarding the highly lucrative contracts and procuring the technology for its construction, and he will report only to Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen Feinberg, the memo says.

The memo also states that Golden Dome will be exempt from traditional Pentagon oversight processes for the military’s most expensive weapons programs, because this “complex, highly technical effort requires a non-traditional acquisition approach and full support from all DoD components from inception.”

**Dozens of companies are vying for a role in developing Golden Dome, the sources told CNN, but among the most competitive are SpaceX, Anduril, and Palantir. All three companies have made pitches directly to Hegseth, who has indicated he wants what they’re selling, CNN has reported.**

# ***NOTE THE FOLLOWING GIVEN ARTICLES ABOVE & BELOW:

**As of August 2025, U.S. mandates under DFARS, Title III, and the 2024 NDAA require defense contractors to prioritize domestic or allied sources (e.g., U.S., Canada, Australia) for critical minerals like Titanium, Niobium, Scandium (including Al-Sc alloy), and rare earth elements (HREE/LREE), with strong emphasis on reducing reliance on adversarial nations.**

**The Department of Defense is actively using Defense Production Act Title III funding, long-term offtake agreements, and National Defense Stockpile mechanisms to secure and expand domestic supply chains. Among potential beneficiaries, Niocorp’s Elk Creek Project in Nebraska stands out as a uniquely positioned U.S. source for scandium oxide, niobium, and titanium, making it a strategic candidate for federal support, offtake contracts, and IRA tax credits as the U.S. accelerates its push for critical mineral independence.**

The Defense Department is at a critical juncture. It must transform how it delivers integrated capabilities to warfighters with speed, scale and operational relevance, said Michael P. Duffey, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, who testified today at a House Armed Services Committee hearing on acquisition reform. 

https://preview.redd.it/jnms4cs33egf1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=79596e803c0e6b253927659de1d6a6aeee5eff4e

Duffey said the department's priorities include rebuilding a more resilient defense industrial base, utilizing rapid and flexible contracting authorities, utilizing multiyear contracts for things like munitions, cutting bureaucratic delays, reforming outdated processes and empowering the acquisition workforce to operate with agility and confidence. 

Reform means encouraging early industry engagement and accelerating the path from requirement to contract, Duffey explained, adding that DOD also seeks to tap into a broader array of companies, including startups and non-traditional vendors, to fuel competition and innovation. 

***\*\*\*\*The department plans to utilize Title III of the Defense Production Act and the Defense Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment Program to strengthen sectors such as microelectronics, energetics and Critical Minerals, Duffey said. \*\*\*\****

Energetics include propellants, explosives, pyrotechnics and other energy-releasing materials. 

""The geopolitical landscape has shifted dramatically. We are no longer in an environment where flexible timelines and risk avoidance are acceptable. What once took a decade must now be delivered in months or weeks to stay ahead of the threat,"" Duffey said. 

This work is not possible without the people who carry it out, he continued.  

""Our 167,000 strong workforce is the connective tissue between strategy and execution. These professionals manage complex tradeoffs, direct billions in taxpayer dollars and ensure our warfighters are never outmatched,"" Duffey said.

Potter, performing the duties of assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition; Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy Jr., acting assistant secretary of the Air Force for space acquisition and integration; and Jesse D.

1meu2z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1meu2z7/is_this_limerence/,Is this limerence?,"TLDR: I still want to be with my teenage love, despite over a decade passing and both of us being in committed relationships for years. We talked 5 years ago after years of no-contact and I still think of it every day. 


13 years ago, when I was still a teenager, I met a guy online (one of those dating apps that no one took seriously; my friends all had accounts for fun, so did he). We lived on opposite sides of the country but he was traveling through my state at the time, so we happened to see each other’s profiles and matched. Out of boredom, we started to talk as friends. Neither of us thought it would go anywhere — we were teenagers living on opposite sides of the country.

We talked as friends for several months. I definitely had a crush on him and he liked me, but what was the point? Then he got accepted to a college just down the road from me. We met in-person for the first time when he visited town for his orientation. That was the first time I’ve ever felt full body jitters and butterflies. I still remember the feeling exactly. We decided to start officially dating and do long distance for a few months until he moved to college in the fall. (He was a year older than me, so I had another year in school.)

The long distance part of the relationship was a bit up-and-down, to be expected given we were so young. After he moved to college, we had a pretty normal relationship. He was definitely my first love, in just about every sense of the word. He was my best friend. I’ve never clicked with anyone or felt as comfortable with anyone as I do with him, even my platonic friends. 

I applied to only one college and it was out of state — my dad’s choosing, not mine (not because of the relationship, my dad just loves this college and he paid for it). This was expectedly a touchy subject for my boyfriend and I given we had tried long distance before and made it work, but enjoyed being together in person a lot more.

If I could go back in time, I would’ve gone to a college in-state. But I didn’t. We broke up shortly after I moved to college in a neighboring state. He visited me once, and I visited him once, and then it ended. We talked for months after it ended. It was mainly me, trying to figure out if we could make it work. He didn’t want to. He wanted a normal relationship where he could grab coffee or dinner whenever he wanted with his partner. Fair.

Fast forward 4 years. He reached out on my birthday. He told me happy birthday, said he’s been thinking about me, said he misses me. We were both in other relationships at that time and talked about how we aren’t as happy in our relationships as we were with each other. (Cruel, I know.) I tried to leave my partner that same day. (That’s a whole other story; but it didn’t happen.)

After he reached out on my birthday, we talked for a few days. It was mainly me, angry, wondering why he wouldn’t just be with me if he still feels that way. Why wouldn’t he make a change? We had both graduated college by that time. We could’ve done something about it. He was hesitant due to “what people might think.” We haven’t talked since; it’s been 5 years. I still think of him every. single. day.

We’re both still with the same partners we were talking about 5 years ago.

Was I just dealt a bad hand? Was this never my love to experience in the first place? I miss him every single day despite trying not to. Sometimes I admittedly give up on trying to fight it. I just accept this is my life now. I don’t really want it to be; I want to be with him, more than anything. He makes me feel confident, loved, and like I don’t need to change to be around him. 

I’ve learned self love in the years we’ve been apart — I know this isn’t a situation of “you just need to learn that you’re already complete and you don’t need another person to feel fulfilled” — I KNOW that, trust me, but I WANT him, so badly, still. I’ve lived a hard life, and he made me feel easy and carefree. I want that feeling again. I want him. And I feel deeply, unexplainably, that he  feels the same.

I don’t know what to do or how to move forward.",2,1754048119.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

1meu0as,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1meu0as/my_neighbor_wanted_us_to_be_friends/,"My neighbor wanted us to be ""friends""","This happened recently and left me emotionally drained and honestly, kind of grossed out, so I’m getting it off my chest.

I live in a small gated neighborhood, and one of my neighbors, someone from my same block, randomly messaged me out of the blue: “Hey, neighbor 😊 what’s your name? Since we live in the same place it would be good to know the people that surround us.” He said it as if it was the most normal thing ever, like “we live close, let’s get to know each other.” I was a bit bored, and he seemed polite at first, so I replied. Thought it was harmless.

The conversation started off normal but gradually escalated. Suddenly he was saying things like he wanted to grab a coffee with me, watch a movie at my place, how he was really lonely and didn’t have friends… You know the tone: casual but with a clear flirty vibe. I continued the conversation thinking he was single (he told me he lived in his parents’ house with “his family”). It felt flirty, but not inappropriate at that point.

Then at one point of our conversation, I straight up playfully asked him if he had a girlfriend or wife, just to be sad about it and go on with life (keep in mind I thought he was single, so I was just playfully being dramatic). And suddenly he hits me with: “Haha actually… I’m in a relationship and I live with her, but don’t worry 😉 it’s all good.”

I froze. I calmly told him that I didn’t think that was okay. That if I had a partner, I wouldn’t like them talking to someone else that way. And what did he do? He downplayed it. He said he wasn’t doing anything wrong, that we could still talk, just “tone it down a bit.” Since what we had was good.

Then, because apparently that wasn’t enough, in the night when i told him we should stop talking, he brought a snack and a rose to my door without me asking for anything. I saw him on my doorbell camera standing there for several minutes after ringing the bell. Later, he texted me saying he “wanted to see me and give them to me in person 🥺.” Then he kept texting as if nothing had happened. Asking what music I like, what shows I watch, if I was still awake.

It left a bitter taste in my mouth. I had opened my heart to something potentially nice, even if it was just a friendship. But he used that closeness as an excuse to start emotionally cheating behind his partner’s back while acting like it was “just neighborly banter.”

What really got to me is how obvious it became that he wasn’t looking for a real connection, he was just looking for someone convenient. Someone to soothe his loneliness. Someone to flirt with while pretending it was innocent. Someone to message late at night when he felt empty like a backup plate he could return to whenever he needed attention, validation, or a little excitement.

And no. Just… no.
I’m not that person.
Not for him. Not for anyone.

News flash:
I’m not his fantasy unlocked.
I’m not his emotional sidequest.
And I’m definitely not someone he gets to flirt with behind his partner’s back and act like it’s harmless.

I haven’t replied since. Left him on read and that’s where it’ll stay. But I still feel that mix of disgust and disappointment that some men really think they can use proximity, loneliness, and vague friendliness to try and build a “harmless” emotional affair while their partner sits at home, totally unaware.

I’m done with that shit.

Okay, this is definitely not something I usually do. Writing something like this to someone I’ve never even met? Kinda weird, I know. But for whatever reason, I felt like putting this out there.

I’m not even sure what I want from it. It’s not about being lonely or looking for attention. It’s more like… I just needed to say this out loud, somewhere. Like there’s this space in me that wants to be understood not fixed, not figured out, just got.

We don’t know each other yet, and maybe we never will. But I think that’s the strange beauty of this. The not-knowing. Still, I wonder what your voice sounds like when you're tired, what song plays when you’re feeling a little lost, whether you take your tea sweet or bitter, or if you’re more of a coffee person who forgets to drink it while it’s hot.

I think I miss a kind of connection I’ve never even had. The small, ordinary stuff. Like doing dishes together while talking about nothing. Or grocery shopping and already knowing which snacks you always pick up. Sitting on the same couch, both doing our own thing, but still feeling like we're together.

I’m 23 now. I’ve got a couple things I care deeply about, and I’m still figuring out how to balance life without losing myself in the process. I don’t want to end up just going through the motions, ticking boxes, chasing things that don’t even feel like mine. I want to laugh at silly stuff, cry during movies without feeling weird about it, and get excited about dumb things like weekend plans or a new playlist.

Maybe you’re out there. Maybe you’re not. Maybe we’ve already crossed paths without knowing it.

If we do meet one day, I hope you get to read this and smile at how ridiculous but oddly sincere it is. Or maybe just roll your eyes a littleI'll take that too.

Anyway, yeah… this is me, putting something out into the world. Not expecting much. Just hoping quietly, genuinely.",1,1754047787.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

The air in Valor Law Group was thick with the scent of polished mahogany and the metallic tang of betrayal. My body, still a battlefield from the miscarriage three days ago, screamed in protest with every shift in the plush leather chair. The internal bleeding hadn't stopped completely. Neither had the gnawing emptiness in my soul. Doctor's orders were bed rest, but Damien Thorne’s legal eagle had made it crystal clear—today was non-negotiable.

""Ms. Caldwell, please sign here... and here."" The lawyer's voice was a flat, sterile drone as he glided the divorce papers across the table. His perfectly manicured finger tapped impatiently at each yellow tab. I couldn’t look at Damien. A decade of marriage, of shared breaths and whispered dreams, had etched every one of his expressions into my memory. Today, I couldn’t bear to see the contempt, or worse, the chilling void that might greet me.

Instead, my gaze snagged on Seraphina Vance, draped beside him like a venomous siren. Her ruby-lacquered nails toyed possessively with the cuff of his bespoke suit, her diamond bracelet winking malevolently in the office light. My bracelet. The one Damien had fastened around my wrist on our fifth anniversary, a lifetime ago.

""Anya,"" Damien's voice finally cut through the silence. Cold. Distant. A stranger’s voice. A shard of ice piercing my already shattered heart. ""The sooner you sign, the sooner we can all move on.""

The lawyer cleared his throat, a calculated interruption. ""I should remind you, Ms. Caldwell, that should you choose not to sign today, Mr. Thorne is prepared to contest any custody arrangements for future children and—""

""Future children?"" The words tore from my throat, raw and ragged. My hand instinctively flew to my abdomen, still a tender ache of loss. ""I just lost our baby.""

Seraphina's lips curved into a smile that never touched her eyes, a predatory gleam in their depths. ""Well, that certainly simplifies things, doesn't it?""

Damien didn't flinch. Not a flicker of emotion. He merely glanced at the platinum watch adorning his wrist, as if my agony were merely a tedious meeting running overtime.

""Sign the papers, Anya,"" he commanded, his voice devoid of all warmth. ""Or you'll leave with nothing but the clothes on your back.""

My hands trembled violently as I picked up the pen. Each stroke of ink felt like another piece of my essence being flayed away. With the final, agonizing flourish, ten years of marriage—of loving Damien, of painstakingly building a life with him, of sacrificing every dream I'd ever nurtured—was reduced to a stack of sterile legal documents.

The drive back to our penthouse—no, Damien's penthouse now—was a hallucinatory blur of rain-slicked Emerald City streets and neon traffic lights bleeding into distorted streaks. My chest felt hollowed out, as if something vital had been violently ripped from my core.

When I reached the custom-built oak door, my key still worked. A cruel, fleeting mercy.

But inside, the world had shifted on its axis.

The walk-in closet in our master suite gaped open, a gaping maw, stripped clean of my designer gowns and silken lingerie. The custom bookshelves had been purged of my cherished first editions and obscure literary tomes. Even the framed photographs, once vibrant monuments to our shared memories, had been meticulously removed, leaving behind ghostly rectangles of faded paint.

In the cavernous living room, designer cardboard boxes were stacked with ruthless precision, labeled in a spidery, unfamiliar script. ""Anya's Relics."" ""Kitchen—Anya's."" ""Miscellaneous Discards.""

A stark note sat on the gleaming quartz counter of the gourmet kitchen, Damien’s precise, unyielding handwriting unmistakable:

Anya,

The movers will collect these boxes tomorrow. You have until noon to vacate the premises. Your access to all joint accounts has been irrevocably suspended pending the finalization of our divorce. Consider this your final notice.

—Damien

No goodbye. No acknowledgment of a decade shared. Just the cold, brutal logistics of my erasure.

A soft, hesitant rap at the door startled me, pulling me from the suffocating fog of despair. When I opened it, Mrs. Albright, my elderly neighbor from across the hall, stood there, her kind, wrinkled face etched with genuine concern.

""I saw the movers earlier, dear,"" she murmured softly, her eyes brimming with sympathy. ""They left these by the door."" She held out a pair of worn sapphire ballet flats—my favorite, the ones I'd padded around the penthouse in on lazy Sunday mornings, sipping coffee and reading with Damien.

That night, I found myself on the cold, unforgiving marble floor of the master bathroom, the chill seeping into my very bones. The bottle of potent sleeping pills Damien had once obtained for his own restless nights lay heavy in my trembling palm. How many would it take? Would it hurt? Would it finally silence the agonizing scream inside me?

""Anya?""

The voice was an aching echo from a past that felt impossibly distant, so achingly familiar that for a dizzying moment, I thought I'd imagined it. But when I looked up, he was there in the doorway—Young Damien. Not the cold, calculating CEO who had sat across from me in that sterile law office, but Damien as he had been when we first met. Nineteen years old, with eyes the color of warm whiskey that crinkled at the corners when he truly smiled. His dark, unruly hair fell across his forehead in that way that had stolen my breath the very first time I saw him.

""Damien?"" My voice was a fragile whisper, barely audible.

He knelt beside me, his movement fluid, and when his hand touched mine, it was warm but somehow not quite solid—like reaching for sunlight through a pane of glass.

""What are you doing, my love?"" he asked gently, his gaze fixed with heartbreaking intensity on the pill bottle in my hand.



2

Morning arrived with the cruel, unyielding persistence of a predator. I hadn't truly slept—not with the weight of that bottle, still uncapped, beside me. The only reason I hadn’t succumbed? His impossible presence, Young Damien, an anchor in the swirling abyss of my despair.

I dragged myself to the bus stop, my entire shattered life crammed into a single, battered vintage suitcase. Mrs. Albright had offered her couch, her kindness a beacon, but pride—the last shard of dignity Damien hadn't managed to shatter—made me refuse.

The bus lurched forward, a mechanical beast carrying me away from everything I'd known. I clutched my phone, mindlessly scrolling through credit card applications, each rejection notification a fresh stab, another door slamming shut on my face. Insufficient credit history. Application denied. Unable to verify income. Each digital message echoed the cold reality of my new, terrifyingly precarious existence.

""They're making a mistake,"" a soft voice murmured beside me, a melody from a forgotten dream.

I looked up, and there he was—Young Damien, his eyes warm with an impossible concern. In the harsh, unforgiving morning light, he seemed more substantial than he had in the pre-dawn darkness, yet still ethereal—like a cherished photograph vividly brought to life.

""What are you?"" I whispered, my voice barely a breath, earning a curious, concerned glance from an elderly woman across the aisle.

He offered that crooked, heart-stopping smile I’d fallen irrevocably in love with a lifetime ago. ""I'm here because you need me, Anya. Always.""

His hand, warm yet intangible, covered mine as another rejection blared across my screen. Though I couldn't truly feel his touch, a strange, comforting warmth spread through my cold fingers. I bit my lip until I tasted copper, fighting back the hot tears that threatened to humiliate me further in this bus full of indifferent strangers.

""You'll figure this out,"" he said quietly, his voice a balm. ""You always do, my fierce Anya.""

The bus jolted violently to a stop, its brakes hissing. When I looked again, the seat beside me was achingly, utterly empty.



""You came!"" Veronica Hayes exclaimed, her surprise thinly veiled as she air-kissed my cheeks at the entrance of Sterling & Thorne's opulent holiday gala. ""I wasn't sure if you'd... well, you know.""

I smoothed down the borrowed dress—a desperate cast-off from Mrs. Albright's perpetually chic daughter. Too tight across the chest, too loose at the waist, a navy shroud that was both unremarkable and perfect for disappearing into the shadows.

""I appreciate the invitation, Veronica,"" I lied, my gaze sweeping the glittering ballroom for Damien. This was madness, pure unadulterated madness, coming here. But I needed to speak with him about the accounts. About the phantom debts. About anything that might offer a sliver of closure, a crumb of understanding.

The party hummed with the superficial drone of expensive conversation and the ceaseless tinkle of crystal. I sipped champagne that tasted like bitter ashes, forcing a tight smile as former friends suddenly found the caviar canapés infinitely more fascinating than my shattered presence.

Mr. Albright, the firm’s venerable managing partner, tapped his crystal glass for attention, his voice booming over the din. ""If I could have everyone's moment, please! We have something truly special to celebrate tonight!""

The glittering crowd parted like the Red Sea, and there they were—Damien and Seraphina, her arm possessively wound through his, a crimson viper coiling around her prey. She wore a gown the color of fresh blood, vibrant and defiant against the muted sea of conservative black and navy suits.

""To new beginnings,"" Mr. Albright continued, raising his glass high, his smile beaming. ""And to the future Mr. and Mrs. Thorne!""

The opulent ballroom erupted in thunderous applause. My champagne glass froze halfway to my lips, the chill seeping into my bones.

""And because a picture is worth a thousand words,"" Seraphina's saccharine voice cut through the cacophony of congratulations, dripping with false modesty, ""we've prepared a little slideshow of our journey.""

The lights dimmed. The colossal projector flickered to life on the pristine white wall behind them.

And there I was—pale, hollow-eyed, curled in a sterile hospital bed. The date stamp, stark and brutal, showed three days ago. My miscarriage. My private agony, my unspeakable grief, projected six feet tall for every predatory eye in the room to devour.

""Oops,"" Seraphina giggled, a sound like glass shattering, feigning embarrassment as gasps rippled through the horrified crowd. ""Wrong folder, darling!""

The room spun, a dizzying vortex of light and shadow. Faces blurred into grotesque masks of horror and morbid fascination. I stumbled backward, my body betraying me, knocking into a passing waiter, sending a precarious tray of champagne flutes crashing to the polished marble floor.

The shattering sound, sharp and deafening, broke whatever cruel spell had frozen me in place. I fled, propelled by a primal urge to escape, to breathe, to simply exist away from their poisoned air.



""Damien!"" I screamed, my voice raw, echoing in the cavernous parking garage beneath his firm the next morning. He was walking toward his obsidian-black Phantom, briefcase held with the casual ease of immense power.

He turned slowly, his face a perfect, unyielding mask of indifference. ""Anya. You shouldn't be here. You're trespassing.""

""The accounts,"" I choked out, my breath forming fragile white clouds in the biting December air. ""They're empty. All of them. Every single cent.""

""Yes."" No explanation. No apology. Just that single, damning word.

""How am I supposed to—""

""You should check your credit report,"" he interrupted coolly, his gaze utterly devoid of emotion. ""The mortgage on the Riverbend Estate, the luxury car loans, your student debt—they're all irrevocably in your name now. My legal team ensured it.""

The ground beneath me seemed to tilt, an earthquake tearing through my already fractured world. ""You can't do that. It's illegal!""

""It's already done."" He checked his watch, a dismissive gesture. ""Anything else, Anya? My fiancée is waiting.""

A sleek black Rolls-Royce Ghost limousine purred to a stop behind him, its tinted window gliding down to reveal Seraphina's smirking, triumphant face.

""Damien,"" I whispered, desperately searching for any flicker of the man I'd married, the man I'd loved with every fiber of my being. ""Why? Why are you doing this to me?""

He turned away without answering, his back a cold, impenetrable wall, sliding into the opulent limousine beside her. As they pulled away, I caught a final, sickening glimpse of Seraphina's triumphant smile through the darkened glass, a silent declaration of war.

Standing utterly alone in the brutal cold of the concrete garage, the stark realization hit me with the force of a physical blow: the man I'd loved was truly gone. And in his place stood someone I no longer recognized—someone utterly devoid of humanity, capable of systematically destroying me without a single, fleeting second thought.

I stared at the anemic ceiling of Rhys’s spare bedroom, watching the distorted shadows from passing cars slither across the cracked plaster. The mattress smelled faintly of mothballs and something else—a lingering scent of my brother's military-grade discipline, perhaps. After the parking garage confrontation with Damien, I'd had absolutely nowhere else to go. My credit cards were maxed out, my accounts emptied, and my name was now inextricably linked to a mountain of debt I hadn't even known existed.

""You can stay as long as you need, Anya,"" Rhys had said when I showed up at his door, suitcase in hand, my eyes swollen from a torrent of unshed tears. His apartment was small—a one-bedroom ingeniously converted to two by adding a thin, almost translucent wall that didn't quite reach the ceiling—but it was immaculately clean and surprisingly warm. Military precision was evident in the perfectly made bed, the precisely aligned combat boots by the door.

I rolled onto my side, wincing at the hollow ache that still lingered in my abdomen. A relentless, physical reminder of everything I'd lost, everything that had been cruelly ripped from me.

""Hey, you up, sis?"" Rhys's voice came softly through the thin door, a lifeline in the darkness. When I didn't answer, he pushed it open anyway, his sleek, custom-built wheelchair barely fitting through the narrow frame. ""Brought you something.""

He wheeled over to the bed and handed me a battered, well-worn leather-bound journal. The cover was smooth and supple at the corners, the pages a delicate yellow with age.

""What's this, Rhys?"" I asked, my fingers tracing the soft, familiar leather.

""My therapist gave it to me when I came back from Syria. Said writing down the next steps, no matter how small, helped make the impossible seem possible,"" he murmured, his eyes, so like mine, holding no pity—just a quiet, profound understanding. ""Thought you might need it more than I do now, Anya.""

I clutched the journal to my chest, fresh tears threatening to spill, a raw, burning sensation behind my eyelids. ""I don't know what the next steps even are, Rhys. I'm lost.""

He gestured to the wall behind me, where his service medals hung in a simple, reverent frame. ""When they first put me in this chair, I couldn't see past the next hour, let alone the next day. But you keep going. One step, then another. That’s all there is.""

He reached out and squeezed my hand, his grip firm, reassuring. ""You'll rebuild, Anya. And I'll be right here, every step of the way.""



The women’s shelter where I'd volunteered before my marriage to Damien was housed in a beautifully converted Victorian in Capitol Hill. I'd spent three incredibly fulfilling years there before leaving, foolishly, to support Damien's meteoric career ascent in Manhattan. Now, back in Seattle with nothing but raw desperation clawing at my insides, I hoped they might remember me fondly, remember the woman I once was.

""Anya Caldwell!"" Isabella Rossi exclaimed, her face lighting up when I walked into her bustling office. ""Or is it Thorne now?""

""Caldwell,"" I said firmly, the name feeling like a shield. ""It's Caldwell again, Isabella.""

Isabella's warm, intelligent brown eyes softened with immediate understanding. She'd been my supervisor years ago, and time had added streaks of silver to her elegant dark hair but hadn't diminished her kind, unwavering smile.

""Well, Ms. Caldwell, your timing is impeccable. We just secured substantial funding for a new community outreach position. The pay isn't stellar, but it offers room to grow and—""

""I'll take it,"" I interrupted, the words tumbling out before I could censor them, then flushed crimson. ""I mean, I'd like to apply. If that's still possible, of course.""

She laughed, a rich, melodic sound. ""Let's start with a formal interview, at least. How's tomorrow look for you?""

I left Isabella's office feeling lighter than I had in weeks, a fragile seed of hope beginning to unfurl in my desolate heart. The next day, I wore my only remaining professional outfit—a crisp navy pencil skirt suit I'd miraculously managed to salvage before Damien's movers descended—and answered Isabella’s questions with growing, unfamiliar confidence. By the end, her warm, approving smile told me everything I needed to know.

""We'll be in touch very soon, Anya,"" she promised, walking me to the door, her hand resting briefly, warmly, on my arm.

Three days later, a terse, impersonal email arrived. My heart plummeted.

Dear Ms. Caldwell,

Thank you for your interest in our Community Outreach Coordinator position. After careful consideration, we have decided to pursue other candidates whose qualifications better align with our current needs.

We wish you the best in your future endeavors.

I stared at my phone in stunned disbelief. The interview had gone perfectly. Isabella had all but offered me the job on the spot.

Before I could stop myself, my fingers were already dialing her direct number.

""Anya,"" Isabella answered, her voice tight, strained. ""I was hoping you'd call, but I dreaded it.""

""What happened, Isabella?"" I asked, struggling to keep my voice from cracking, to rein in the rising panic.

A long, agonizing pause. Then: ""I shouldn't be telling you this, Anya, but... Seraphina Vance called our executive director yesterday. Damien's firm is our biggest, most vital donor, and she made it explicitly clear that if we hired you, they would immediately withdraw all their financial support.""

The phone nearly slipped from my suddenly numb fingers, clattering against the floor. ""She did what?""

""I'm so, so sorry, Anya. We simply can't lose that funding—we'd be forced to close our doors. Thousands of women would be left without a safe haven.""

After we hung up, I stumbled to Rhys's fire escape, perching on the cold, unforgiving metal, watching the sun bleed across the Seattle skyline, staining the clouds in hues of fiery despair. The metal was icy through my thin pants, but I barely registered it. First my marriage, then my home, my financial security, and now even the chance to rebuild my professional life—all systematically stripped away, piece by agonizing piece.

""Beautiful, isn't it?""

I turned, startled, to find Young Damien sitting beside me, his long legs dangling casually over the edge of the fire escape, his silhouette etched against the fading light. In the deepening twilight, he looked almost solid, almost real.

""Do you remember our first date, Anya?"" he asked, his eyes reflecting the deepening twilight, filled with a bittersweet nostalgia.

""The dive bar near campus,"" I whispered, a ghost of a smile touching my lips. ""You spilled your cheap beer all over my pre-med textbook and then tried to dry it with a napkin from the floor.""

He smiled, a familiar, crooked grin, and suddenly I wasn't on the cold fire escape anymore but back in that crowded, dimly lit university bar, watching nineteen-year-old Damien frantically blot at my ruined textbook with sticky napkins, his face flushed with endearing embarrassment.

""I'll buy you a new one, Anya, I promise,"" he was swearing, his eyes—so warm then, so full of untainted life—meeting mine across the rickety table.

The memory shifted, kaleidoscopic. We were dancing, barefoot, in the spring rain on the empty quad, my sundress plastered to my skin, his unrestrained laughter echoing across the deserted campus.

Then, we were lying on a threadbare blanket in the absolute darkness just outside Madison, watching the Perseid meteor shower streak like burning tears across the summer sky. ""Someday, Anya,"" he whispered, taking my hand, his fingers intertwining with mine, ""I'm going to give you the entire goddamn world. All of it.""

The cherished memories faded, dissolving like smoke, leaving me brutally alone on the cold fire escape, hot, silent tears streaming down my face. The agonizing contrast between those treasured moments and my current, brutal reality was almost too painful to bear.

""Why are you showing me this?"" I asked the empty air where Young Damien had been, my voice cracking, desperate for an answer.

But there was no answer, only the distant, mournful wail of a passing train and the hollow, suffocating ache of everything I'd lost.",1,1754047543.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

But a regular specialty shot, to be honest, it was Okay, I wasn't expecting too much from Indonesia especially for me.
And the cup was hot. At the end of the cup, the coffee was very soft and I liked it.
So,next day a asked to brew it into a room temperature cup. The Barista was like getting stuck, like, ""how?? We have all cups on the coffee machine preheated by default, mmmm"" :) And I asked cool it down just by water.
And the shot was veeery soft without a bitterness. I repeated this several days and with a hot cup again. The result is the same: unheated cup = soft espresso.

Hopefully this'll attract some of you!

My locations in the title are set in stone, as I'm looking to meet someone I can talk to throughout the day. Timezones are important and whilst I do love meeting people from totally different cultures, I'm looking for what I'd class as a typical friend who will get my frames of reference and so on, on this occasion. I would be up for texting if we get along really well!

That's enough about my requirements. A little about me: I'm Nick, I live in the East of England and am originally from Nottingham. I left home at 18 for uni and just never went back (except to visit), and that means I've lived in a few different places over the years. Holding down friends is tough as an adult, I find. What about those I met at school? I left them all behind as they got into drugs and they seemed to care more about them than me. I was always the odd one out who drank but never did anything else. I still wanted to play football everyday while they passed a joint around (or often worse).

Anyway, this isn't a 'feel sorry for me' post, I'm just providing context. I love coffee, rum, lager, good food, daydreaming, deep conversations, British bands and underground music. My interests include football, cricket, reading, writing (plus the stationery that goes along with it), journalling, mental health, psychology, and if you look at my post history you'll see something else I'm a little too embarrassed to put into this. It's not NSFW btw 😂 just not typical of a 33 year old bloke!

I love people who are calm-natured and are on the more affectionate side. I don't want a girlfriend, just to be clear, nor do I want a FWB. I just like people who are naturally caring and warm towards those they care about.

I think that's about it for now. Hopefully this'll interest you. Hit me up and let's get to know each other 😁",1,1754047332.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1metrkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1metrkq/progenitor_chapter_5_epiloguefinal_chapter/,Progenitor Chapter 5 Epilogue/Final Chapter,"Progenitor Chapter 5 - Truth, Genocide and the Future - *They are not perfect. The Plan may not work as intended. But they will love and endure.*

Sarah flew into the observatory.

It had a diameter of at least one kilometer. When you entered, it felt like floating through the darkness of space. A dark room illuminated by miniature stars and star systems. Nebulae and the glowing dust rings of black holes were visible. In this case, however, it wasn’t just celestial bodies. If you wanted, you could focus on a specific part of the galaxy, and the observatory would zoom in. You could see ships, cities on planets, down to the resolution allowed by the hidden satellite network in hyperspace.

Sarah moved forward. Small drones belonging to the ship's AI, MINA, floated around, cataloging and analyzing planets and empires. Even a mind as powerful as that of a Progenitor could not possibly grasp all the details the observatory displayed. Sarah approached the center of the map. Tomaz was there, and MINA hovered beside him in the form of her larger main drone. MINA’s primary drone was a gray torus with a glowing blue eye in the front. Tomaz hovered there in the true form of a human: a glowing sphere of bio-electrical and psychic energy.

Sarah floated closer. She heard Tomaz’s thoughts: *""Hello, my love.""*  
Just as MINA echoed: *""Beloved Creator!""*

""Hello, both of you. Tom and Marni are in bed, and I thought I'd check in on you... and 'our' galaxy. Any crises or problems?""

The question was more a joke than serious. They were practically drowning in problems and crises. The young races often sought not enlightenment, but the satisfaction of their fears, desires, and self-imposed excessive needs.

MINA answered: ""We only have 37 negotiation opportunities scheduled for next week.""

""How many will we actually take?""

Tomaz spoke into her mind. ""As usual, a maximum of seven. But there are some particularly difficult conflicts among them. We’ll be lucky if we manage five.""

""I wish our son Danilo were here... or that our friends hadn’t had to leave.""

""The war against the Nalgara is approaching its peak. More reinforcements are arriving from the surrounding galaxies. It was tough in the meantime, but now that the Shulva have mobilized their war arks and sent massive reinforcements, the conflict will end quickly. Susan and Jordan will return soon. It will take at most a few hundred thousand years, then the Nalgara will be defeated.""

""Lately we’ve seen more and more civilizations reach maximum power but not enlightenment. The number of wars we fight is increasing, and so is the number of races we’re forced to wipe out.""

""Defeating them militarily and sending their remnants into void exile is not genocide. At least not a complete one.""

""It still doesn’t feel right.""

""The Nalgara wiped out over a hundred races in their galaxy without mercy and tried to hide it from us before we noticed and mobilized enough of our own to stop them. It is not weakness, nor a moral failure, to protect those who cannot protect themselves.""

""But doesn’t the rising number of races like the Nalgara suggest that our plan to seed the universe with life isn't working as we hoped? Maybe the seeding strategy itself is a moral failure.""

""We are not gods. We don’t always end up being right...""

""Which is exactly why we must question whether the seeding strategy is truly the right path.""

""The majority consensus is still in favor of seeding. 93% in the last vote.""

""A million years ago, it was still 95%.""

""Anything over 80% is consensus.""

""Guess I'm not part of the consensus,"" Sarah stated dryly.

""Filling the universe only with humans was dismissed by the Ancients as 'egocentric.' And while there are more races like the Nalgara, there are also more like the Shulva or Baerki who reach maximum power and enlightenment and share our honorable goals.""

""I know. I just can’t shake the feeling that we may have overreached.""

After a pause, Sarah added:

""Maybe I’m just worried about Tom and Marni. In 10 to 20 years, we’ll have to leave them on the target planet. What if their descendants become like the Nalgara and someday go out and try to destroy others? And then we come back... and kill our own grandchildren. What would have been the point of raising Tom and Marni?""

""You know I agree with you on many things. We’ve raised too many races—or rather, the Ancient Humans were a bit too optimistic with their ""they will find the right path even if we dont hold their hands"" mindset. They admit that themselves now.""

""Then let’s push for change in the next vote. We need to slow the seeding process.""

Tomaz was uncertain. There were reasons for fast seeding too—such as ensuring races developed together without too large a technological gap. Slower seeding would increase power disparities between the younger races.

""I’ll think about it, my love."" Tomaz chuckled. ""Soon you’ll turn me into an anti-seeder too.""

""If I don’t, then the workload will devour you. When was the last time we did... I miss your warmth and your love.""

MINA chimed in: ""If dear Tomaz would finally agree to my proposal to bring the Baerki into this galaxy to help, then we could better care for the young races—and you would have more time for each other.""

""What’s stopping you?""

""I worry that the races are too young to understand that while humans are the first and true Progenitors, some of our children have now begun to reach our level and have attained Ancestor status through enlightenment and power.""

""The Baerki are exceptionally skilled diplomats. With their help, we could improve our seeding efforts here.""

""You two agree..."" He paused. ""MINA, extend feelers to the Baerki collective. Request the long-term deployment of an ark here to assist in raising the younger races.""

""Gladly.""

""And the two of us... Let’s fly home. We need to finally share soul communion again.""

Sarah giggled. ""It sounds so obscene when you say it like that.""

""You love my no-nonsense personality. That’s why you married me—over four billion years ago.""

As they floated home side by side, they didn’t talk about problems but about successes.

""Did you know the Golani girl and the Odrell Prime Minister got married, now that the peace treaty was signed on both sides? Her family fell from a Top 100 status to near-pariah within a week—and then skyrocketed into the Top 10 of the Hierarchy. What a roller coaster ride. And reporters ask the Prime Minister more about his Golani wife than about the treaty. He's working non-stop to keep both the opposition and the tabloid press in check. I truly hope for a peaceful future of these Species.""

""That’s a development even we couldn’t have foreseen. I hope the two of them become a symbol for what Golani and Odrell can achieve together. Should we gift them a genetic recombinator?""

""The Golani still have the one we placed on their homeworld from back then when we placed Gol and Nani on there during this galaxy’s second wave of seedings. They’ll get access to it.""

""You see, there are many problems—but it’s not all bad.""

""It’s not all bad... as long as we have each other.""

They reached the house and floated through it. They checked on Tom and Marni, who slept peacefully in their beds, unaware of what the future held for them.

They entered the parental “bedroom.” There was no bed—only two soft cushions on the ground, placed across from one another. They let their round bodies sink onto them and began the merging. Slowly and gently at first. Then, with growing intensity and completeness, their minds merged.  
They shared their fears, worries, hopes, dreams—and most importantly... their love.

They were not gods.

But they were true lovers.

But there’s a catch: **user-uploaded files are basically invisible to your custom agent** unless you go out of your way to handle them. If you’re used to the magic of Office 365 Copilot (where you can ask questions about a document you just attached), Copilot Studio’s approach can be… well, a bit of a letdown.

But after some deep dives, late-night experiments, and way too many cups of coffee, I’ve found **six ways** (from totally no-code to full-on pro code) to help your custom agents actually *do something* with user-uploaded files. Here’s how you can level up your Copilot Studio agents.

I’m a woman from Denmark who will be visiting Thessaloniki solo next week from Mon-Sat.

I’ve been to Greece before, but it’s my first time in this region.

I’m a big history enthusiast, so I’m planning to visit mainly museums and historical sights with some nature;

Day trip to Vergine and Pella - booked Mt Olympus/Dion day trip - booked Archaeological museum, Jewish Museum, and Byzantine Museum Churches, tower, and ruins in the city

Potentially a Kavala and Philippi day trip. Not sure how interesting this city is though? I’d love to hear if anyone has been there.

I also love Greek cuisine and coffee. I’d love any recommendations for quick bites like Bougatsa, loukamades, gyros, Greek wine, and freddo cappuccinos.

I also read that the city can empty out a bit in August, how quiet / closed is it really? I’m a little worried about everything being closed.

I acknowledge all of that. But this just happened and I need to get this off my chest, so deal with it.

It's the last day of a 2-week camping trip with the family, meaning we spend most of the day cleaning up. Me(24F) and my sister(29F) are off to do the dishes(which is just stuff from breakfast and cups from last night). 

We take the tub with the dishes over to the hot water sinks. And as soon as I unload the last dish, we get to the first gripe: the tub has crumbs that are stuck to it. I knew they were stuck, and was about to fill the tub with hot water to rinse it out. I don't get the chance. My sister takes the tub from my hands, looking at me like she knows better, and just holds it upside-down over the grass, only to be absolutely shocked to find out that half the crumbs are stuck to the tub. When I told her that I knew they were stuck, she gave me the ""eh, whatever"" look.

Then we get to gripe number two. See, my plan was that I wash the dishes since I'm faster with my hands than she is, and have her dry, and then once I'd finished washing, I'd help her dry what was left. I thought that'd be the obvious plan, since me being faster is common knowledge in our household. But no. My sister asks ""should I wash?""(an annoying habit she has of framing things like a question but there only being one right answer, but that's a whole other thing and I'm not gonna get into that). I tell her that I think it's a better idea if I wash since I'm faster. She ignores my words completely and starts washing.

Which brings me to the third and probably biggest gripe. This girl – who is six months away from being 30 mind you – starts washing dishes like she's never done it before. Every tea and coffee spoon – one by one, slow as can be. I've seen 15 year old bussers on the first day wash dishes faster than that. Now, my sister doesn't take criticism very well(especially not from me), so I'm standing next to her holding the towel keeping quiet but constantly thinking ""hurry up, hurry up, hurry up"" because I just wanna get this done, right? I've never had the urge to pull a brush from someone's hands before, but oh my god. I was *this* close to just telling her to go away and let me do the whole thing by myself(which probably would have been faster). 

Anyway, that concludes the small and petty rant. I may end up deleting this later, but holy shit, does it feel good to just get that out of my system.",1,1754046466.0,rant,0,1.0,False

""The Governor does not support activation for the mission as it's currently articulated and has concerns about insufficient detail and planning,"" Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for the governor, wrote. per Seven Days.

Governor Phil Scott has denied a Trump administration request to deploy Vermont National Guard troops to assist ICE operations, citing insufficient detail and planning in the proposal.

While Scott's spokesperson noted he agrees that addressing violent criminals here illegally is important, the governor suggested alternatives like reassigning recently laid-off federal employees instead of Guard troops.

The TRIO Student Support Services program has served 225 students annually since 1983, providing everything from prioritized advising and tutoring to mental health counseling and four-year college visits. The numbers speak volumes: CCV's TRIO students are three times more likely to graduate than eligible students not in the program. Director Conner Gilbert, himself a TRIO alum, knows firsthand how this support transforms lives and helps students overcome barriers to achieving their goals.

[No Encore: Nectar's Closes for Good](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/music/no-encore-nectars-closes-for-good-44109893?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=friday-august-1st-festival-of-fools-weekend)

""The truth is, we've been hit hard,"" Nettleton and former booking agent Ryan Clausen wrote in a May press release. per Seven Days.

Burlington's iconic music venue Nectar's has played its final set after nearly 50 years of hosting local bands and touring acts. The Main Street club that helped launch Phish in the mid-1980s couldn't overcome the challenges of downtown construction, changing nightlife patterns, and ultimately, failed negotiations with landlord Joe Handy. Former employees are now clearing out decades of equipment and memorabilia from the venue that inspired Phish's album ""A Picture of Nectar."" While the original location won't reopen, sources suggest conversations continue about keeping the Nectar's brand alive through shows at other venues or finding a new home. Despite its closure, Nectar's still won two Seven Daysies awards this year for best small live music hotspot and best place to dance.

""We're cosmically lucky to live where we do and among you fine folks reading this,"" per Seven Days.

Seven Days celebrates its 30th anniversary with a zodiac-themed readers' choice awards recognizing 241 winners and 946 finalists across Vermont. From favorite folk bands to creemee stands, the Daysies highlight what makes the Green Mountain State special at a time when downtowns are struggling and communities feel fractured. This year's democratic process drew massive participation as Vermonters voted for their favorite businesses, people, and places. Winners and advertisers are invited to celebrate at the Seven Daysies Party tonight (Friday, August 1) from 7-10 p.m. at the ECHO Center in Burlington.

[Vermont Has Made Little Progress on Homelessness, Report Finds](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/report-vermont-has-made-little-progress-on-homeless-crisis-44110550?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=friday-august-1st-festival-of-fools-weekend)

""We know providers work diligently to make sure that this is as accurate as possible,"" Sarah Russell, Burlington's special assistant to end homelessness, said at a press conference. per Seven Days.

The latest Point-in-Time Count recorded 3,386 homeless Vermonters on a single January night, including 633 children and 215 seniors over 65 - a 200% increase since 2020 but roughly unchanged from last year. The actual number is likely higher, with June's coordinated entry data showing at least 4,588 homeless individuals statewide. Vermont now ranks 4th nationally in homelessness per capita. The state has 602 shelter beds (all full) and the motel program currently serves just over 1,000 people, down from 2,300 in March. The report calls for investments in affordable housing, expanded emergency shelter options, tenant protections, and various policy changes. Different stakeholders continue to debate the most effective approaches, with some advocating for increased funding and services while others question the sustainability and effectiveness of current programs. The complexity of factors contributing to homelessness - from housing costs to mental health and substance abuse issues - ensures this remains one of Vermont's most challenging policy discussions. Find the full report for yourself here: [2025 Report](https://helpingtohousevt.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FINAL-State-of-Homelessness-2025.pdf?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=friday-august-1st-festival-of-fools-weekend)

[South Burlington Hires a New Police Chief from Dover, New Hampshire](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/30/south-burlington-hires-a-new-police-chief-from-dover-new-hampshire/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=friday-august-1st-festival-of-fools-weekend)

""The rigor of the selection process for our new chief was thorough and inclusive,"" City Councilor Elizabeth Fitzgerald, who was part of the advisory team created for the hiring process, said. per VTDigger.

William Breault will lead South Burlington's police department starting October 6, bringing 26 years of experience from Dover, New Hampshire where he oversees 54 officers. Selected from 14 nationwide applicants through what officials described as an extensive process involving community input, Breault holds an FBI National Academy graduation and degrees in criminal justice and public administration. He'll earn $160,000 annually managing Vermont's second-largest city's 40-officer force and $8.3 million budget. The hire comes after former Chief Shawn Burke resigned in March to serve as Burlington's interim chief, leaving Deputy Chief Sean Briscoe as interim since February. South Burlington, with over 20,000 residents, continues to navigate public safety needs while balancing community concerns about policing approaches and budget priorities.

[Burlington's King Street Center Seeks Mentors for Boys](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/burlingtons-king-street-center-seeks-mentors-for-boys-44105934?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=friday-august-1st-festival-of-fools-weekend)

""You don't need to be an expert. You just need to care,"" said Kate Vetter, the center's director for philanthropic partnerships and communications. per Seven Days.

King Street Center faces a critical shortage of male mentors, with 11 boys on the waiting list while 36 girls have matches. The need is urgent as male students nationwide struggle more academically and face higher dropout rates, while recent Burlington violence has involved boys as young as 14. The 54-year-old nonprofit serving one of Burlington's poorest neighborhoods asks mentors for just 4-8 hours monthly for at least a year. Success stories like Uson Karki and mentor Alex Demoly show how these relationships provide crucial support and positive activities. Executive Director Shabnam Nolan emphasizes that mentoring offers kids belonging they might otherwise seek on the streets. The center provides activity funding, mental health support for mentors, and recently secured state funding to hire recruitment staff before the school year begins.

""We're going to change the way we work,"" CEO Dr. Sunny Eappen said. ""We've been pushed to do that, because we don't really have another choice."" per Vermont Public.

Vermont's largest hospital system is cutting 77 non-clinical positions and leaving dozens more vacant to save over $5 million as part of $185 million in spending reductions by next year. The cuts span finance, patient registration, HR, and IT departments, with some layoffs immediate and others extending through September. Additional measures include eliminating executive bonuses ($10 million savings), delaying infrastructure projects ($70 million), and improving clinical efficiency through reduced hospital stays and standardized procedures. Unlike last year's cuts that closed psychiatric units and primary care clinics, no patient services are being eliminated. The moves follow state-mandated insurance rate reductions of 8% at UVM Medical Center and 3% at Central Vermont Medical Center to address Vermont's nation-leading healthcare costs.

# 202+ Things to Do in Burlington (Summer Activities)

Today’s picks:

Five more to keep the ideas coming as we roll through late summer. Start with a paddle from the Community Sailing Center where you can rent a kayak or canoe and explore the Burlington shoreline at your own pace. Visit the Ethan Allen Homestead and take a short walk through the museum before heading down to the riverside trails. Check out the murals scattered through downtown and the South End and turn it into a casual walking route with a coffee in hand. Spend a lazy afternoon at Leddy Park where you can combine a beach visit with a quiet picnic or a game of tennis. If you're looking for something different in the evening, see what's playing at Vermont Comedy Club and grab a seat for a show.

Thanks to customizable **braces colors**, orthodontic treatment is no longer dull or uniform. Whether you're a teen looking to stand out, a professional opting for a subtler style, or just someone who loves experimenting with color, there’s a braces shade that fits you perfectly.

In this guide, we’ll explore the psychology of color, offer expert tips on choosing the right braces color for your skin tone and personality, and show you some of the most popular, trendy, and even unusual combinations people are rocking in 2025.

# What Are Braces Colors?

Braces colors refer to the small elastic bands, also known as ligatures, that hold the orthodontic wire to each bracket. These elastics are available in a variety of colors—from traditional gray and black to bright neon green or metallic silver. The best part? You can change them every time you visit your orthodontist, which is usually every 4 to 8 weeks.

# Most Popular Braces Colors in 2025

In 2025, fashion meets functionality in orthodontics. Here's a look at what colors are trending:

* **Pastel Blue & Baby Pink** – Soft, aesthetic, and highly Instagrammable. A favorite among teens and influencers.
* **Emerald Green & Forest Tones** – Earthy and grounding. Great for those with olive skin or brown eyes.
* **Glitter Gold or Metallic Silver** – Bold, eye-catching, and surprisingly elegant.
* **Black & Gold Combo** – A luxe combination often chosen by adults or athletes.
* **Rainbow Braces** – Still trending strong, especially during Pride Month or for festive occasions.
* **Glow-in-the-Dark Colors** – Popular with kids and available in clinics with fun-focused braces offerings.

# Choosing Braces Colors Based on Skin Tone

Skin tone plays a huge role in determining what braces colors will complement your look. Here’s a quick breakdown:

# For Fair Skin:

* Best choices: Light blue, silver, soft pink, lavender
* Avoid: Yellow or white (may make teeth look stained)

# For Medium Skin:

* Best choices: Emerald green, navy, teal, or deep purple
* Avoid: Brown or orange (may blend too much with skin)

# For Dark Skin:

* Best choices: Bright colors like magenta, turquoise, gold, or neon green
* Avoid: Black or dark green (may look too muted)

# What Braces Colors Make Your Teeth Look Whiter?

Let’s be real—some colors can enhance your smile while others make teeth look dull or yellow. Here’s a cheat sheet:

✅ **Colors That Make Teeth Look Whiter:**

* Dark Blue
* Deep Purple
* Emerald Green
* Burgundy
* Navy

❌ **Colors That Might Make Teeth Look Yellow:**

* Yellow
* White (surprisingly, yes!)
* Clear (can stain over time)
* Gold (if your teeth have warm undertones)

# Braces Colors for Different Moods & Events

You don’t have to commit to one color for your entire treatment. Change it up depending on the season, mood, or occasion:

|Event / Mood|Recommended Colors|
|:-|:-|
|Valentine's Day|Red and Pink Combo|
|Halloween|Orange and Black|
|Christmas|Red and Green|
|Summer Vibe|Aqua and Coral|
|School Spirit|Your School’s Colors|
|Birthday Month|Rainbow or Favorite Color|
|Formal Occasions|Silver, Gold, or Clear|

# Color Ideas by Personality Type

Colors often say more about you than you realize. What vibe are you giving off?

* 🟣 **Creative & Artistic**: Try lavender, sky blue, or gradient shades.
* 🔴 **Bold & Confident**: Red, magenta, or electric blue.
* 🟢 **Nature-Lover**: Forest green, olive, or earthy tones.
* ⚫ **Low-Key or Professional**: Gray, navy, silver.
* 🌈 **Fun & Outgoing**: Neon colors, rainbow, or glow-in-the-dark.

# Kids vs Adults: Braces Colors That Work Best

# For Kids:

* Fun is the name of the game. Let them pick glow-in-the-dark or cartoon-inspired colors.
* Pro tip: Consider letting them change colors at each orthodontic visit to keep them engaged.

# For Teens:

* Teens often go for trends. TikTok-inspired pastel shades or popular influencer combos (think: black & neon green) are huge right now.

# For Adults:

* You don’t have to play it safe, but many adults choose:
   * Neutral tones: Silver, black, or navy
   * Occasion-based: Metallic or pearl shades for weddings or events

# Tips Before You Choose Your Next Braces Color

1. **Consider Staining**: Lighter colors tend to stain from coffee, curry, or tomato sauce.
2. **Look at Your Wardrobe**: What colors do you wear most? Match your braces for consistency.
3. **Check Your School/Work Rules**: Some schools or jobs may prefer subtle colors.
4. **Ask for a Color Wheel**: Most orthodontists have one—spin and see what stands out!

# Braces Color Combinations That Just Work

Here are a few combos that consistently look awesome:

* 💜 Purple & Teal – Fun and funky
* ⚪ Silver & Black – Classic, professional
* 💚 Green & Gold – Rich, luxurious vibe
* 💙 Navy & White – Clean, nautical feel
* ❤️ Red & Orange – Vibrant and warm

# Braces Colors to Avoid (Based on Real User Feedback)

Not all colors are created equal. Some patients regret these:

* ❌ **White** – Easily stains, makes teeth look yellow
* ❌ **Yellow** – Enhances any natural discoloration
* ❌ **Clear** – Stains quickly from food/drinks
* ❌ **Brown** – Can look like food is stuck in your teeth
* ❌ **Flesh-toned colors** – Too close to your skin, creates a washed-out look

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

# Can I change my braces colors every appointment?

Yes, most orthodontists allow you to choose new colors during your monthly visits.

# How long do the colored elastics last?

Typically, 4–6 weeks, until your next adjustment.

# Are colored braces more expensive?

Nope. Braces colors are generally included in your treatment plan at no extra charge.

# Can I mix two or more colors?

Absolutely! Most orthodontists love helping you design multi-color combinations.

# Final Thoughts: Let Your Smile Show Your Style

Your smile is one of the first things people notice, and with the power of **braces colors**, you get to turn that smile into a statement. Whether you're after a fun vibe, want to support your favorite sports team, or simply want to feel more confident during treatment, your color choices can help you feel more in control and expressive.

Go bold. Go subtle. Go seasonal. Or switch it up every month. The choice is yours.

At night, the family went to their old horse stable solitary on the Kansas prairie. It was a wooden structure of twelve square feet comprised of two levels, the ground and upper level with its white paint long faded to time. The upper level was used to store numerous things Joseph needed to care for the animals. But the ground level where the horses were kept was where it happened, the great tragedy of David family. For many years, they dared not to step foot on its land. It was here where their beloved Joseph met his doom. With every step forward, Belle and Mary trembled as ghosts of painful memories ran past them. Their minds saw phantom steeds dash away from the burning stable. Among them, Mary ran to the scene only to find Belle, a child, crying over her father’s dead body. And even all these years later, Belle could still feel the hellish heat of the barn on fire.

Daisy gazed upon the stable thoroughly scanning its dilapidated state. ""My god, I still remember Pa working so hard to raise the horses here. Ma, how could you ever think about selling it?""

""After all these years, I still struggle with Joseph's death.” Mary gripped half her face with her hand. “So when I thought you died, I wanted to be rid of my sorrow. If only a little.""

""Daisy, why are we out here? So we can relive the day that ruined our lives?"" Belle asked

""I'm sorry. When I saw the stable, I couldn't help but ask.” Daisy took a deep breath. “The reason why I brought you so far from town is to get away from prying ears. And you can’t find anywhere more solitary than Pa’s place.”

“For what?” Aisha asked.

“T-there’s no easy way to tell you this. But I’m Damara the Valiant.""

Aisha burst out laughing. ""Daisy, I love you, but you are not a war hero. I don't think I've ever seen you hurt so much as a ladybug.""

Daisy looked at Aisha with her brow furrowing as she laughed at her statement. But she swiftly summoned the divinus's light and emerged from it as Damara. Her family was taken aback by the transformation, especially Aisha, as she fell to her knees, dead silent.

Mary looked at Daisy intensely, ensuring her eyes didn’t lie. ""So this is how you survived.""

""And because of the sacrifices of a good man. Ma, now that you know who I am, you know that-""

""You're going back into that killing field. Why?""

""Because I'm Joseph David's daughter. And because I made promises, I need to honor them. Ma, there are billions of little girls that are about to lose their fathers.""

As Mary heard Daisy, she started crying and walked away from everyone else. And Daisy looked at her mother, speechless, at a loss on how to console her.

\*\*\*

Daisy lay with Carter on the grass, staring at the starry night sky with Aisha and Belle beside them.

""Sissy, are you sure you can't give the divinus thing to someone else?” Belle pointed towards Carter. “Like the pretty boy, for example.""

""No, I'm the only one allowed to use it. I hate putting you through this, but please understand.""

""Daisy, we understand, but we still hate it.” Aisha got up weeping, slowly wrapping her hands around her neck. “You came back to us, but now you're leaving for that death trap. If I hear that you died again, I might commit s-""

*""Don't you dare say that vile word. I will come back alive, and we'll run our boutique together like planned.""* Daisy interrupted.

As they heard Daisy, the two women shared sideways glances.

Daisy looked at Belle and Aisha, perplexed. ""What is it?""

""The Boutique is dead. We lost all our clients.""

*""How?""*

""After we lost you, our dream seemed so meaningless. So we didn't have the strength to keep fighting for it.""

""Let's promise right now. When I return, we'll work hard like never before and get our dream back on track.” Daisy initiated a pinky promise. “You can expect me to fly down to Pa's stable early on the first day of March.""

With her words of assurance, her sisters shook to the core, accepting the pinky promise. But Aisha and Belle started crying as they finished. They hugged Daisy with an unyielding grasp, and she reciprocated.

""D-daisy, I know this might sound strange, but can you please bring out the horse?"" Belle asked.

Daisy grew a smile. ""Really?""

""What can I say? I'm Joseph David's daughter, too.""

Daisy giggled but quickly granted Belle's request, summoning her noble stallion. Playfully guiding her to look to the right with a glance, the horse emerged from the divinus's light. And he swiftly brushed his nose gently against Belle's face.

""He's a handsome boy. Does he have a name?""

""I like to call him flaremane.""

Like lightning, a herd of wild horses ran through the prairie. Flaremane saw them and spotted a beautiful mare. The noble stallion became love-struck, preparing to chase after her, drawing everyone’s gazes. But as he started, Carter pulled on his reigns, stopping him.

""Sorry, horse, but I prefer not to know what will come of that.""

Flaremane snarled at Carter like a rabid dog, but he looked straight at the stallion with an apathetic expression. As the girls saw them, they burst into a laughing fit, clutching their stomachs in pain.

\*\*\*

Two days later, Daisy and Carter prepared to leave Lilyville. Carter put his and Daisy's suitcases in the back of his car. As he finished, Daisy hugged Belle and Aisha goodbye, but her heart skipped a beat as she saw Mary walking towards them.

As Mary arrived, she looked at Daisy, piercing through her with the violet eyes she passed down to her youngest daughter. Carter and the girls traded sideways glances. She only interacted with them by the barest minimum over the past two days. None of them, not even her daughters, had the slightest guess of what she would say. But Daisy had prepared her defense. The young woman would insist that she loved and respected her mother, but regardless, she still had to leave for the greater good. However, as the words began to exit her mouth, Daisy saw tears escape Mary’s eyes, stopping her.

Mary cried as she looked at Daisy. ""I will pray for you every night until you return, my kind and brave child.""

""Thank you, Ma.""

Mary and Daisy hugged each other goodbye, and as they finished, Daisy hurried into the car with Carter.

""Boy, you'll protect her with all your might, won't you?""

""No need to ask, ma'am. That was the plan.""

Daisy and Carter waved goodbye as the car drove off. And as they left, the David family watched with teary eyes as their beloved Daisy hurried off to war. Knowing too well that all they could do for her was pray.

Elsewhere, on Placentia, Mavor landed on the flying castle in his spaceship. The slaves quickly rolled out a long red carpet of the finest fabric before its doors. He departed the vessel with his guards, walking down its path to Cymbeline. He and his soldiers met their emperor, kneeling by the entrance. But as Mavor reached him, he signaled for him to stand. And hastily, he began to heed his emperor's command.

""A warrior as mighty as you, Cymbeline, should never be on his knees,"" Mavor said.

""Thank you, emperor.” Cymbeline stood up. “I mean no disrespect, but why are you here? I already sent my report on the status of the colonies. Are you dissatisfied?""

""On the contrary. There's something I wanted to discuss with you in person. Please let us go inside.""",1,1754045479.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

Clive watched Ros intently as she practiced her martial arts a few meters away. She was a young woman set broadly with healthy thighs, short, unruly pink hair, and flawless light pink skin. Never before did he experience such feelings for a woman. He didn’t know if he was captivated by her physical beauty or the beauty of her combat prowess. The combination of the two fed into each other, amplifying their effects, enamoring Clive like a siren song. But as she practiced combat with her Bo staff, she soon noticed Clive staring at her. 

Ros marched up to him, groaning. ""Let me guess. You're wondering why the Nemesis isn't in chains, right human?""

""N-no.” Clive vigorously shook his hands before his body. “I'm sorry for staring. I know it's rude.""

Ros looked at Clive, blushing as she admired his appearance. ""Apology accepted. So what's your name?""

""Clive Rogers. And you?""

“Lieutenant Clive Rogers?”

Clive nodded.

""Ros Lightwell.""

""Okay, I have to know. How-""

""Did a Nemesis get involved with the United Planets?” Ros interrupted.

Clive nodded again.

“It's a long, painful story, but my comrades and I came to our senses. We defected and now we want nothing more than to end Mavor's deranged campaign.""

""Glad to have you aboard.""

""Glad to be here."" Ros extended her arm for a handshake. 

Clive shook Ros’s hand, but he still held it after. His grasp on her slightly tightened enough to enjoy her touch without hurting her as he grew a faint smile. Ros’s heart rate increased. “I have to go.” As she pulled away from Clive.

“Do you need a sparring partner?”

“Why do you ask?”

“I am a lieutenant. Maybe I can teach you something?”

Ros, relenting, nudged her head in the direction where she was going. Clive soon followed behind Ros, walking to her preferred spot. And as they stood before each other, they took fighting stances, beginning martial arts training. The two swiftly began trading blows. Ros gave Clive a jab to his face. Clive in turn gave a knee to her stomach, and she retaliated with a kick to the side of his head. However, as he blocked the strike, the pattern continued.

\*\*\*

The battle between the two lasted at least an hour. The combatants continuously landed heavy blows on one another. But as the punches to their bodies mounted, tired, wheezing laughter escaped their mouths instead of screams. As Ros went to throw another, she tripped in her exhausted state, landing in Clive’s arms.

Ros blushed, looking at Clive inches from his face, hurrying away. ”Sorry.”

“Don’t be.”

“This has been a fun workout, but maybe we s-“

Someone threw a juice bottle at Ros’s head, drenching her with the red beverage. As Clive searched madly for the perpetrator, his eyes widened as he saw it was his fellow United Planets soldiers.

""How many times do we have to tell you? We want to see your face as little as possible, Nemesis. So why are you still out here?""

""I-I'm sorry. I wanted to get a little more training. And I lost track of the time.""

""Leave.” The soldier pointed off into the distance. “Just looking at you makes me sick.""

Promptly, Ros heeded the soldier’s demands and started to leave. But Clive grabbed her arm, stopping her, and he glared at his fellow soldiers. 

As the soldier Ros was talking to saw him, he quickly walked to Clive with a similar glare. ""Are you humans with us or against us?""

""Go to h-""

""Clive, stop. They have every right to hate me.” Ros pulled her arm away from Clive. “I'm not worth fighting over.""

""But they can't just...Fine.""

Swiftly, Ros continued to leave, and Clive followed her.

""She's right when she says she's not worth fighting over. Because she's not worth anything.""

With the soldier's words, Clive's patience was exhausted. He stopped walking and directed a wrathful gaze at him. Hastily, Clive jogged back to the soldier, and he raised his fists for the impending attack. Still, his preparations were fruitless as Clive punched him in the face faster than he could defend, knocking him into a set of training weights.

A battle ignited in Ros’s name. The soldier got up and charged at Clive, but he backhanded him away. His comrades restrained Clive's arms, and again, he charged at him. Swiftly, the soldier punched Clive in the gut, but he broke free, head-butting his opponent in the mouth. However as he knocked away his comrades, a kick to one and an elbow to the face of the other, the violence prompted retaliation. Still, as Clive fought, knocking one opponent unconscious after the other, Damara ended the conflict.

Her shield flew through the crowd, hitting all the combatants in the face, including Clive, leaving them lying on the ground in pain. And even as they tried to recover, with one disappointed look from Daisy, the soldiers knew the battle was over. 

In her presence, the soldiers grew dead quiet. Daisy scanned through the crowd from left to right, ensuring everyone shared in her gaze.

""There was once a noble and wise Nemesis. He selflessly lay down his life for a girl who wasn’t even his species. He believed in the dream that created this army.” Daisy stopped scanning the crowd just before reaching Ros. “He believed the day would come after the war when all intelligent life could enjoy peace and freedom. So, like it or not, you will have to forgive the Nemesis. And if you have a problem with this, you have a problem with me.""

Her words came through as clear as day, and quickly the soldiers left. Ros dashed at Clive to check on him as they went, and Daisy followed her.

""Thanks, Damara. Those clowns were out of line,"" Clive said.

*""I wouldn't be so casual, Lieutenant Rogers. I'm just as angry with you as I am with them. I expected better from a friend of Carter- I mean General Carter.""*

""She's right. I told you to back off, and now look what happened.” Ros cried. “It's not even like I didn't deserve what they gave me.""

As she heard Ros, Daisy took her hands, looking at her with a smile.

""My problems with Lieutenant Rogers aside, what those soldiers did was wrong. Everyone deserves kindness, especially the repentant.""

Daisy’s words hit Ros with more force than Clive’s punches. For so long, she endured the hatred of the Nemesis empire’s victims. However, now, the hero of the galaxy, the greatest enemy of the empire she once served, came to her with words of kindness and redemption. She fell into a crying frenzy, balling her eyes out. As Daisy saw her turmoil, she comforted her with a hug.

A few minutes later, amongst the hustle and bustle of the base, Favian and Carter shared a rare moment of agreement. They both looked upon an embarrassed Clive with frustration for his actions, especially Favian, as a vein bulged on his forehead.

""Clive, bud, what's the one thing you know I didn't want you to do?""

""Erode discipline.""

*""And what did you go and do?""* Carter shouted.

""Erode discipline.""

""Sirs, I think I should take some responsibility. I should have tried harder to pull him out of it,"" Ros said.

""I think the same goes for me. I did a poor job keeping our promise, General Favian.""

""No, you're both wrong.” Favian ran his hand over his head. “These events are reflections of us as generals. If our subordinates lack discipline, then it’s no one's fault but our own. At least everything else is running smoothly.""

Everyone looked off behind Favian, gazing intently at something. As Favian saw them, he followed their gaze to witness what they saw. His eyes soon fixed on Yara as she sweated a deluge.

""Yara, what is it?""

""Well, General Favian, I don't want to give you any more bad news, but we have problems. Our troops have reported several snags with the evacuation.""

""Such as?""

""In Palus Urbs and several other settlements in the area, they've experienced difficulty moving the critically ill. They need more time and resources to do it safely or run the risk of-"" Yara moved her thumb across her neck, mimicking a blade slashing her windpipe as she coughed out. 

The veins on Favian’s forehead bulged again as he saw her display, placing his hand over his face.

""Yara, I believe the visual presentation was unnecessary. But by the gods, what else could go wrong?""

In outer space, the answer to Favian's question sped through the void at light speed. A giant mechanical structure charged toward the western planets with relentless progression.",1,1754045470.0,HFY,1,1.0,False
1met952,https://www.reddit.com/r/Didiar/comments/1met952/braces_colors_how_to_choose_the_right_shade_for/,"Braces Colors: How to Choose the Right Shade for Your Personality, Style & Confidence (Full Guide 2025)","Choosing the right **braces color** might seem like a small thing, but if you’ve ever stared into a mirror wondering, *“Do I want to look fun or fierce this month?”*, you know it’s a whole vibe.

Whether you're rocking brackets for medical alignment, cosmetic reasons, or a long overdue bite correction, the rubber bands (also known as **ligatures**) are your chance to **express yourself** — one smile at a time.

Let’s dive deep into the colorful world of braces — from the **best shades to choose**, **mistakes to avoid**, **color psychology**, **cultural trends**, **skin tone matching**, all the way to how AI is helping personalize dental experiences.

# 🌈 Why Braces Colors Matter More Than You Think

You’re wearing braces every day for at least 18 months (sometimes way longer). Why not have fun with them?

Unlike clear aligners that hide in the shadows, **traditional metal braces** are right there on your teeth — front row. The colored elastic bands wrapped around the brackets are **your chance to style the hardware**.

Choosing the right braces colors is a mix of:

* **Aesthetic styling**
* **Psychological confidence**
* **Practical hygiene**
* **Seasonal trends**
* **Cultural expression**

# A Smile That Matches Your Personality

Your smile is one of the first things people notice. So what does your color choice say?

|Color|What It Says|
|:-|:-|
|**Red**|Energetic, passionate, bold|
|**Blue**|Calm, cool, collected|
|**Green**|Earthy, relaxed, balanced|
|**Purple**|Mysterious, creative, royal|
|**Pink**|Soft, loving, playful|
|**Black**|Stylish, edgy, powerful|
|**White**|Clean, reserved, subtle|
|**Rainbow**|Fun, quirky, confident|
|**Clear**|Minimalist, mature, professional|

# 🎨 Full Color Palette Breakdown

Modern orthodontists offer **50+ shades**. You’ll usually see a color wheel at your ortho office with options like:

* **Neon**: Yellow, green, pink, orange
* **Pastels**: Mint, lilac, baby blue
* **Deep tones**: Maroon, navy, forest green
* **Classic**: Red, black, silver, gold
* **Transparent & glow-in-the-dark**

Some clinics even let you **customize patterns**—like:

* Alternating school colors
* Pride rainbows
* Holiday combos (think red & green for Christmas)

# 💡 How to Choose the Best Braces Colors (Like a Pro)

Here’s a full checklist you can use before your next appointment.

# ✅ Match Your Skin Tone

* **Cool skin tones**: Blues, purples, teals, silvers
* **Warm skin tones**: Orange, red, yellow, gold
* **Neutral**: Lucky you—almost anything works

If you're unsure, hold a color wheel up to your cheek in natural light. Trust your gut instinct on what complements your natural vibe.

# ✅ Consider Your Wardrobe

If you wear a lot of **blue or denim**, blue braces will blend beautifully. Love **earth tones**? Try olive or brown. If you go bold—fluorescent pink or highlighter green—just be ready to commit.

# ✅ Want Whiter Teeth? Pick the Right Contrast

* **Dark shades (like navy or deep purple)** make teeth look brighter
* **Avoid yellow or green**, which may make teeth appear stained
* **White or clear bands** can discolor quickly from coffee, curry, or soda

# 📆 Best Braces Color Ideas by Season

Braces colors can be a **seasonal accessory** too. Switch them up every 4-6 weeks.

**🌸 Spring**  
Soft pinks, pastel green, baby blue, lavender

**☀️ Summer**  
Neon orange, aqua, coral, watermelon combos

**🍂 Fall**  
Maroon, olive green, amber, rust

**❄️ Winter**  
Silver, icy blue, deep purple, navy

**🎉 Holidays**

* Halloween: Orange & black
* Valentine’s: Red & pink
* Christmas: Red & green
* Pride: Rainbow or trans flag pastels

# 🙈 Common Braces Color Mistakes to Avoid

Even though you can switch colors often, some choices come with regret.

# ❌ Yellow or Light Green

These can look like plaque or food stains.

# ❌ White Bands

They pick up every bit of pigment from food or drinks—especially coffee, curry, or tomato sauce.

# ❌ Brown or Beige

Not only do they disappear, but they may also give the illusion of… well, let’s just say not-clean teeth.

# ❌ Too Bright for Sensitive Skin Tones

Neon green can clash with fair skin, and stark red might overpower deep complexions.

# Braces, AI & Smart Personalization?

The intersection of orthodontics and **AI personalization** is fascinating.

Imagine AI tools that analyze:

* Your skin tone
* Hair color
* Lip shape
* Eye color
* Even personality quiz data

And then suggest your **ideal braces palette**.

It’s already starting to happen in **AI-driven consumer customization platforms**. If you’re into smart tech, you’ll love this:

# Color Psychology in Orthodontics

Colors aren’t just about aesthetics—they **impact your mood**, confidence, and perception.

Studies show:

* **Blue & green** reduce anxiety
* **Red & orange** increase attention and energy
* **Purple & pink** boost creativity and emotional balance

This matters because **orthodontic treatment is a psychological journey**, especially for teens and young adults.

**Color = Control**  
Choosing your braces color helps give you back a little control in a long process.

# 🧬 The Science of Confidence in a Smile

A confident smile isn’t just cosmetic—it improves:

* **Job interview performance**
* **Dating success**
* **Self-esteem**
* **Social trust**

Orthodontists report that **patients who choose bold or happy colors** tend to be more positive about their braces journey.

Some even go a step further, combining **orthodontics + therapy** for anxious patients, especially kids. (Pairing this with therapeutic AI robots? That’s the future.)

It’s normal to feel lost or out of place at first ,  fitting in doesn’t happen overnight. Here’s what actually helped me:

* Join clubs or societies at your uni, especially ones for internationals or things you’re into (sports, gaming, music). Even if it feels awkward at first, it’s one of the easiest ways to meet people.
* Go to social events  like welcome weeks, mixers, or even casual hangouts. Don’t overthink it, just show up.
* Start small conversations with classmates or flatmates. Asking about homework, the best coffee spots, or weekend plans can break the ice.
* Use social apps or Discord servers for your uni or city, tons of international students hang out there and it’s less pressure than face-to-face.
* Find a mentor or older student who’s been through it. They can give advice on everything from academics to making friends.
* Keep in touch with people back home but don’t rely on that as your only support. Try to balance it.

## Key Features Analysis

The variety of copper electric tea kettles available in 2025 caters to a range of preferences and needs. Examining their key features allows consumers to make informed decisions based on their individual requirements.

**Capacity:** The capacity of copper electric tea kettles typically ranges from 1 liter to 1.7 liters. Larger capacities are suitable for families or frequent entertaining, allowing for multiple cups of tea or coffee to be brewed at once. Smaller capacities are ideal for individuals or couples who prefer a single serving or need to boil water quickly for specific purposes. The internal markings often indicate minimum and maximum water levels, ensuring safe and efficient operation.

**Material and Construction:** While the exterior often features a copper finish, either solid copper or a copper-plated stainless steel, the interior is typically made of stainless steel to ensure food safety and prevent metallic tastes from leaching into the water. the gauge of the stainless steel contributes to the kettle's durability and heat retention. Copper conducts heat efficiently, but stainless steel provides the necessary corrosion resistance. Handles and knobs are usually made of heat-resistant materials like Bakelite or silicone for safe and pleasant handling.**heating Element and Power:** Most copper electric tea kettles utilize a concealed heating element, which is submerged in the water and heats it directly.

I’m looking for your go-to dirty fasting tips and tricks.

The longest fast I’ve done was 6 days, just water, and it was rough. This time, to make it a bit easier (or as I like to say, trick my brain), I want to try dirty fasting.

I’m planning to include Coke Zero (which I really like) and of course electrolytes, maybe some bone broth as well? But I’m wondering: instead of the usual bulletproof coffee, could I have tea with heavy cream? I don’t like coffee. Would that still count as dirty fasting?

According to my trusty friend (aka ChatGPT), I can consume up to 50 calories per day while fasting and still stay in the “dirty fasting” range. So I’d love to hear your best advice, hacks, or personal routines that work for you.

Here’s my plan. I’ll be doing a 6:1 schedule for two months. On my refeed day, the 7th day, I’ll go carnivore or at least stay keto.

Hopefully, I’ll be back in two months to share how it went. In the meantime, I’m all ears for your recommendations. Thank you for being such a great community. I’ve already learned so much from you all.",0,1754044153.0,fasting,8,0.25,False

Biological mother? But she was his biological mother... wasn't she?  
Chapter 1

Five years into their marriage, Aurelia finally discovered a secret-Caleb, the little boy she'd been raising as her own, wasn't hers at all!

She stood outside the doctor's office, accidentally overhearing her husband Cassian talking with the doctor.

""Mr. Thornwell, the kid's got a really rare blood type.His biological mother must come here ASAP.""

Cassian pinched the bridge of his nose, looking exhausted.

""Yeah, okay,I know. I'll... I'll figure something out.""

The words hit Aurelia like a bolt of lightning, her mind going completely blank.

Biological mother? But she was his biological mother... wasn't she?

Standing there in the hallway, she slowly pieced together what they were really talking about.

The man who'd promised to love her forever had been cheating even before their wedding—and had switched their babies!

But why would he do this to her? They'd known each other since they were kids, grew up together in the same neighborhood.

She'd given up everything for him—her job at the marketing firm, her dreams of starting her own business—just to be his wife and stay home with Caleb.

When she told him, Cassian had actually gotten down on one knee right there in their kitchen, tears streaming down his face.

""Baby, you're giving up so much for us. I swear to God, I'll never let you down. Never.""

Those words were still ringing in her ears, but reality had just bitch-slapped her across the face.

She stumbled back toward Caleb's room, feeling like someone was squeezing her heart with a vise grip.

She couldn't even look at him now—terrified she might drag him off for a DNA test,afraid she'd lose it completely and make a scene.

She turned and bolted from the hospital.

Outside in the parking lot, her brother Silas was just getting out of his car. Seeing her rushing past, he quickly caught her arm.

""Whoa, Aurelia! Where are you going? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

""How's Caleb? I came to check on him.""

Ever since Caleb got sick, their whole family had been freaking out. Silas had even blown off a board meeting in Tokyo and flown back on the private jet...

Aurelia's eyes were red and puffy, tears already spilling over. ""Silas, I need you to look into something for me.""

""Sure, what's up?""

""Caleb..."" Her voice cracked. ""I don't think... I don't think he's actually mine.""

...

""Hey baby, where'd you disappear to? Caleb woke up asking for his mommy.""

Staring at Cassian's text, Aurelia read her tears hit the phone screen.

Every December, he'd take Caleb up to their cabin in Aspen for a week. ""Guy time,"" he'd call it. ""Father-son bonding.""

Four years of this bullshit, and she'd never questioned it once.

Now she felt like the world's biggest idiot. It wasn't father-son bonding—he was taking Caleb to see his biological mom!

If she hadn't overheard that conversation today, she'd probably still be living this lie.

Aurelia frantically scrolled through her camera roll—hundreds of happy family photos flashing by. The California sun was blazing outside, but she felt freezing cold, shaking like a leaf.

Maybe she should've seen this coming. Men's promises weren't worth the breath they wasted making them.

Being a selfish asshole was just in their DNA, especially guys like Cassian. CEO of a Fortune 500 company, movie-star looks, family money going back generations—he could have anyone woman.

So he'd thrown her away like yesterday's trash. Her and her baby.

But he'd sworn he'd never hurt her...

It felt like someone was taking a rusty knife to her chest, carving her up piece by piece.

They'd been together since high school. Everyone in their social circle knew how obsessed he was with her.

When she was fourteen and some creeps from the school were hassling her outside the mall, Cassian had taken on all six of them by himself.

He'd ended up in the ER with a broken nose and three cracked ribs, but the first thing he asked was, ""Good job?""

At eighteen, when she forgot to text him back during a sorority mixer, he'd called campus security, her friends, even her parents.

When he finally found her, he'd been crying harder than she'd ever seen.

At twenty-two, he'd gotten his grandmother's engagement ring from the family safe—a five-carat diamond that had been in the Thornwell family for generations.

""Marry me, Aurelia. I'll never hurt you, I promise.""

The way he'd looked at her that day, like she was his entire world—so she'd said ‘yes’ without hesitation.

She got pregnant six months after the wedding.

Cassian had completely lost it with happiness, calling everyone they knew. He'd even taken a leave of absence from Thornwell Industries.

""I want to be there for every second of this,"" he'd told her. ""Every prenatal appointment, every craving, everything.""

His dad had threatened to kick him off the Thornwell family.

The board members thought he'd lost his mind.

But Cassian had stood his ground, even when his father called him a ""playbpy embarrassment to the family name.""

Now she realized the truth—he wasn't trying to take care of her. He was making sure nothing happened to her pregnancy so he could pull off his sick little baby swap.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming FaceTime call. ""Hubby"" flashed on the screen, and she wanted to throw up.

She answered with a dead expression.

Cassian's face filled the screen, still as gorgeous as ever, which somehow made this worse.

""There you are! Jesus, baby, you look awful. Are you okay?""

Before all this, she would've told him everything. Every bad day, every worry, every time someone looked at her wrong—she'd run straight to Cassian to fix it.

Now she couldn't stand any sight of him.

""Aurelia? Have you been crying? Where the hell are you? I'm coming to pick you right now.""

Cassian was already reaching for his keys, looking genuinely panicked.

""It's ok. Just grabbing coffee."" She was too emotionally drained to even pretend anymore. ""I'll be back in a few.""

He relaxed a little, but his eyes kept darting off-camera. After a weird pause, he said, ""Okay, but don't take too long. Caleb keeps asking when Mommy's coming back.""

""Yeah, okay.""

Just as she was about to hang up, a hot woman walked into frame and casually settled onto Cassian's lap like she belonged there.

Aurelia's blood turned to ice. Before she could even process what she was seeing, the call went dead.

She sat there staring at the blank screen. Then she started hitting herself in the chest with her fists, trying to make the pain stop, but it just kept getting worse.

He was with that woman. Right there in their son's hospital room.

She buried her face in her hands, trying not to completely break down in public, but the sobs came anyway.

This was what rock bottom felt like. This was what happened when your entire life turned out to be a lie.

For about two seconds, she'd tried to convince herself that maybe Cassian was the victim here. Maybe some bitch was obsessing over him, manipulating him somehow.

But he'd looked pretty fucking comfortable with her on his lap.

Silas noticed her breakdown and rushed over, his iced latte forgotten on the counter.

""Hey, hey... Aurelia, look at me."" He crouched down next to her chair, his voice gentle but furious. ""That piece of shit doesn't deserve your tears.""

The tears just kept coming, leaving dark spots all over her white sundress.

Silas looked like he wanted to murder someone. He rubbed her back awkwardly—he'd never been good with crying women, even his own sister.

""Listen to me, okay? We're gonna get your real baby back. I don't care what it takes, how much it costs, or who I have to destroy to make it happen.""

His voice got harder. ""And Cassian? He's gonna pay for what he did to you. But right now, I need to know—what do you want to do? Because whatever you decide, I've got your back.""

Aurelia looked up at him through her tears and nodded. The moment she'd learned of Cassian's betrayal, she'd already made up her mind...

Chapter 2

Aurelia spent the entire night in that 24-hour Starbucks, just sitting there thinking.

She'd given up everything for Cassian—her job at Marc Jacobs, her own fashion line that was about to launch, her whole identity. All to play games with him.

But she was still Aurelia Westvale.

Her family owned half of Manhattan's real estate, and she'd graduated top of her class from Parsons.

Even Vogue had been courting her before she threw it all away to be a wife and mom.

So yeah, she was destroyed right now. But she wasn't done.

She scrolled through her contacts and called her best friend in Zurich.

""Elena? Remember how you said your company was looking for a new creative director? Is that still open?""

There was a pause. ""Wait, are you serious? What about Mr. Perfect? Cassian would lose his mind if you moved to Europe.""

""Well, that's not really his call anymore."" Aurelia's voice was flat. ""We're getting divorced.""

""Holy shit, what?! Did he cheat? I swear to God, if that bastard—""

""I'll explain everything when I get there. Can you send me the job application? I want to get my visa sorted ASAP.""

After they hung up, Aurelia splashed cold water on her face in the bathroom and got to work.

My main problem over the last couple of years has been acid reflux caused by a hiatal hernia.

I've tried hard to kick my morning coffee and I'm down to half a cup but even that has a bad effect on me.
My reflux goes mad and stomach just churns all day, my face goes all red and blotchy and my whole body feels inflamed and achy. Even Decaf has this affect.
This is even if I have food before drinking the half a cup of coffee.

But last couple of days I've delayed drinking it until after a mid morning snack, so about 3 hours after waking and the difference is amazing.
No redness or inflamed feeling.
Just a bit of acid which I can control with one PPI.
Again, this is either Caf or Decaf.

So what is going on?
Is it just that I have more food on my stomach or is it something to do with cortisol levels dropping mid morning?
