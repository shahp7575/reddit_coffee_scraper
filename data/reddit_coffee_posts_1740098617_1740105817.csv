1iugcp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1iugcp4/first_dates_and_lack_of_serious_follow_up_f20s/,First dates and lack of serious follow up (f20s),"I've been on a few dates and always felt so good about them but most guys I went out with ghost me, our conversation fizzles out, or kinda expect to hook up soon after. 

I'm in my mid 20s and I usually match with people around my age to a bit older. I've only gone out with guys between 26 - 30 tbh never older or younger.

Before the dates, I usually text the guy for around a week or two with like relatively consistent responses. My profile say that I'm interested in a serious relationship and like to take things slow.

Most of my dates follow a relative similar formula where we grab coffee then grab some food and we talk for hours. Then after if the date went well, I would always say I loved hanging out with them and that we should hang out again. After that, guys would either ghost me, or invite me over to their apartment. I would tell them that I'm not comfortable with that yet and then I would get ghosted or they would be like ""oh ok"".

So, a little about me…Well, I’m rocking the oh so cool age of 43, have a couple kiddos, couple dogs/floofs, married 12 years, have a career I love, enjoy being outside, sipping coffee, cooking every now and then, traveling, cuddling in on the couch for a good movie, big fan of fried pickles, and ummm love a tasty bowl of berries and melon to chomp on at night….bowl of lucky charms also makes a good replacement if no fruits…

For starters, we are renovating and do not have a dinner table right now. Dad got his plate first, and was watching the hockey game, so he ate at the coffee table while I finished up in the kitchen. Baby boy likes to watch me cook, so he was content with me for a few minutes while I plated up my own. 

We go into the living room, and baby boy bee lines it for dad. He crawls to dads side, stands up, and immediately reaches for some of dads dinner. Dad of course said no, and blocked his hand. The LOOK he gave dad, like ""How DARE you say no to me?"" And he continued to reach for dads food. 

I scooped baby boy up so dad could finish, and he burst into tears, arching his back, wriggling to get free from my embrace. He wanted that food BAD. 

He settled down when I gave him a teething toy, and in hindsight, should have put him in his highchair before I did what I did next. But I thought I could hold my boy and eat my dinner at the same time. Bad idea. He reached for my bowl, grabbed the edge of it, and yanked it off the table - tomato sauce and penne noodles EVERYWHERE. 

Oops. 😂 I placed him in his highchair to clean up, and he proceeded to scream and protest at the top of his lungs until I gave him a few noodles.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iufuqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1iufuqw/fluinduced_review_of_8_springish_fragrances/,flu-induced review of 8 spring-ish fragrances!!~,"hey! this is my first time writing a review here...i'm very much an amateur, so this review is less about notes and technical stuff and more about vibes! i actually was going to write this review much earlier but got busy with school. well, i'm stuck in bed now with the flu, and my brain is so mushy i can't do actual work, so i thought i would reminisce about not having clogged sinuses and being actually able to smell things 😩😩 enjoy my 103+ degree feverish ramblings?

i sampled these fragrances on the basis of them feeling ""spring-y"", which is pretty vague. there's not really rhyme or reason to the selections and it's not like a cohesive sampling of a collection or anything, but they all do feel spring-y!!

**1. diptyque - fleur de peau**  
*on paper:* first sampled this in a department store. ADORED the pepper note on the paper, it lasted for a really long time. having the sample paper in my jacket made me feel like such an It Girl, like i was summering in an artist's loft in paris and drinking black coffees and writing existentialist poetry. decided to get a sample to spray on skin.  
*on skin*: i'm sooo glad i got a skin sample, because i was so close to getting a full bottle right then and there in the store—HOWEVER, this is so different on my skin (and not in a good way) 🥲 the carrot comes on *really* strong and stays for the whole time. i can't get the pepper at all. just a slightly sour carrot that turns into a slightly nice musk (but definitely not nice enough to justify $250 for a bottle). 4**/10**

**2. jo malone - english pear and freesia**  
*on paper:* also sampled this at a department store at first. thought it was too green for me and i didn't think i was into it.  
*on skin:* i actually received a free sample of this when i got a full bottle of velvet rose & oud, and i didn't think i'd really use it, but i was pleasantly surprised!! it actually turns into a really nice crispy pear on my skin!! i feel like i am in a jane austen novel when i wear this, waltzing around the english countryside in a regency dress with ribbons in my hair, picnicking in meadows and skipping across streams. this is such a spring fragrance. would maybe shell out for a 30 mil travel spray of this after i finish my 30 mil of nectarine blossom & honey :)) **7/10**

**3. jo malone - peony & blush suede**  
*on paper:* this just smells like my mom. that's because my mom has the peony & blush suede lotion. i wasn't going to get a sample of this because i don't necessarily want to smell exactly like my mom (i love her, it just feels…weird?? to smell exactly like her) but again, free sample with the purchase of a FB of velvet rose & oud, so…  
*on skin*: i actually wore this to a lunar new year gala. i was wearing a water-lily patterned qipao, and thought i wanted a soft, pink floral to pair with it. i'm so glad i did!! i still associate this with my mom, but it's a lovely fragrance. it's very *wedding*. i don't really know how else to describe it, but i feel like this fragrance is very very bridal. big fluffy dress and veil and pink bridal bouquet sort of fragrance. i'll use up the rest of the sample for sure, but only when i'm at school and not when i'm around my mom, lol! **7/10**

**4. bdk - gris charnel**  
*on skin:* i didn't test this anywhere, i just bought the sample based on the fact that i wanted to smell like chai. and GOODNESS IT LIVED UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS!! this was my absolute favorite of all the fragrances i've sampled. it might be my favorite fragrance ever. saving up for a full bottle—that'll be my next purchase. this does smell more winter than spring, but spring where i live is kind of cold still so i would definitely still wear this in the spring. i just don't think my 2ml sample will last that long 😂 this smells like i'm reading classics in a library with a bookshelf ladder, with pastries and tea on the side. and i'm curled up on an overstuffed armchair like a cat on my boyfriend's lap. (he loves this.) someone is baking a cake in the background and it's raining outside and i am wearing expensive cashmere. this smells so classy to me (and really kind of sexy? which i wasn't expecting from a tea fragrance, but this is definitely also a night out fragrance for me). will say 1 spray is plenty enough, this is very strong and i'm usually into skin scents/light scents as really heavy scents trigger migraines. **1000/10. if i could bathe in this i would.**

**5. hermès - un jardin en mediterranée**  
*on skin:* also didn't test this in a department store, bought a sample because the notes interested me. on my skin it smells very masculine. a little too masculine for me. actually it almost smells like the masculine, summer version of gris charnel?? the vibes are kind of similar? obviously the notes are different but that was my initial impression upon sampling. after a couple more tries on my skin, i can safely say that this is a beautiful, well-blended fragrance, but it's not for me. too green and too male. i feel like i would smell this on someone who is really self-assured, dresses in linen pants in the summer, speaks 5 languages and makes a really good pesto. i don't know what one could possibly do with this description but that's the best i got. **3/10 for me but would love to smell this on someone else!**

**6. jo malone - osmanthus blossom**  
*on skin:* i am on the hunt for a good osmanthus scent, i was born in china and osmanthus was my childhood!! osmanthus desserts, osmanthus bushes around my house, candied osmanthus and lotus root…*everything* osmanthus.  
I was so, superbly disappointed by this. it smells very strongly of rubbing alcohol?? i don't know if it's just a really old sample because i think the actual fragrance has been discontinued? it smells like a really bad cheap alcohol-forward body spray, it doesn't smell like osmanthus *at all*. i literally can't get any other notes except alcohol upon spraying this. maybe an hour after spraying i get a woody base on my skin, but no osmanthus :// **0/10 this is a scrubber and i am throwing away the sample it's unwearable :(**

**7 - maison margiela - lazy sunday morning**  
*on paper:* tested this in a sephora. i couldn't smell much except the alcohol on paper, but that might be because sephora is just really overwhelming scent-wise, so i think it was just an anosmia-inducing environment.  
*on skin:* decided to give this a second chance because i saw good reviews! this smells like pears and laundry to me. i don't really love it and i am using it as a bedtime scent. it just smells like a fancier version of my wall-plug ""fresh linen"" air freshener 😭 **3/10 inoffensive but a bit boring**

**8 - juliette has a gun - pear inc**  
*on skin:* if you couldn't tell from my previous sample choices, i really like pears, lol! when i was little my mom made this dessert/folk remedy called 冰糖蒸梨 really often (rock sugar steamed pears?) and pears just smell like care and love and home to me. also i associate pears with spring even though pear season is really july/august. i don't know why, i just do. i feel like this fragrance is ""young,"" not in the sense that only young people should wear it of course, but just that it's ""young."" can i explain more? no not really. anyway, this fragrance was really one-note, literally pear and an ambroxan bomb. i liked glossier you, but strangely even though that one also has ambroxan as a note, i've found out i'm not the biggest fan of strong ambroxan. so this was…not great and a little bit nausea-inducing. if you like ambroxan this is so for you!! unfortunately something about ambroxan just does not agree with me, so i never reach for this sample. may be a throw-away sample like osmanthus blossom, i just don't enjoy wearing it at all. **2/10**

anyway i hope everyone enjoyed reading this :) i will go back to suffering from the Fluest of Flus 🫠 and hope that soon my sinuses will be back to normal so i can enjoy fragrances 🥹",3,1740103955.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False
1iufund,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sororities/comments/1iufund/cob_process_rejection_any_insights/,COB Process + Rejection - Any Insights?,"Hello, I need some help i decided to do  COB (Continuous Open Bidding) and get some advice on what might have happened during my recruitment process.

I initially rushed in the fall, but due to some personal stuff that came up, I ended up dropping out. After that, I decided to go through the COB process in the spring to give it another shot.

So far, I’ve attended several COB events and coffee dates with different sororities, but almost all of them have ghosted me after either the coffee date or the COB event. One house, however, really stood out to me. I had three coffee dates with them and attended two or three COB events. I got along incredibly well with all of the girls. During one of the coffee dates, we ended up talking for three hours straight, and it honestly felt like really clicked

After the COB event, they told me they would reach out for another coffee date, and I was super excited. My friends who are already in my house mentioned that the recruitment girls said they liked me, thought I was cute, and that I seemed nice. But, then... I didn’t hear back for about two weeks.

Finally, I received a message saying:

*""We appreciate your time and effort getting to know us this week. We think you are lovely, unfortunately, we can’t offer you a bid. We encourage you to explore other chapters and we still value you as a friend and hopeful Panhellenic sister. Let us know if you would like us to help you navigate contacting other chapters."" (By the way, I didn't meet with them after the COB event, so I believe they sent me a copy-and-paste message.)*

I won’t lie— I was ugly crying, especially since I felt such a strong connection with them. What’s even more confusing is that 3 other girls were picked by the house, and they didn’t do nearly as many coffee dates or COB events.I was wondering if it's because I'm overweight compared to the other girls? 

I'm honestly struggling to understand why I didn't receive a bid, especially since I felt I had a great connection with the girls. I'm curious if anyone has any insights or advice—what might I be missing? Experienced something similar where anyone else exp they felt they were a great fit but still weren't chosen? If I try again in the future, would I even have a chance to get into a house? ",1,1740103948.0,Sororities,1,1.0,False

I genuinely cant imagine where id be now without the zoloft. I am currently running on 200mg. I have had very few side effects. No headaches at all, a little bit of tummy trouble that balanced itself out within the first two weeks, and ill get nightmares on nights i forget to take it, but thats mostly it… 
except… 
my libido is virtually GONE. 
Which is crazy to me because before the sertraline my drive was insane. Now i have to like work myself up to sex. Dont get me wrong, i still enjoy it, but i dont crave it the way i used to. I just dont get it anymore and its created my own personal turmoil. Essentially what im trying to say is, who else has gone through this and is there any advice you can give?

I know she has OCD and perfectionism, but that doesn’t mean she can’t make progress in her life. Also, just to mention it, I’ve met her in person, and she came off as quite distant—not that it’s really important, but I thought I’d share.

This morning I was travelling up to see some family (but not family that I'd ever share what happened with) and they live about two hours away. I was just leaving my city in the left lane and turned on my signal to go into the right lane and merge onto the highway. This new, fancy BMW SUV that was in the right lane but far enough back that there was enough room for me to merge over decided to step on it and close the gap, honk at me and then flip me off. When we made it up to the red light ahead I made the lovely decision to get out of my car, walk up to the BMW and throw my iced coffee through the drivers window which was rolled down a few inches. Safe to say it got ALL over the inside of this guys car. I quickly got back into my car as he was exiting his, and he picked up the remaining drink and threw it at my windshield as I drove off into a corning neighborhood to try and get away from him. He chased me around these really snowy and slippery streets and I was able to get away from him after crashing into someone's decorative bricks that went along their grass line. It completely messed up the front of my car as I flew over this homeowner's lawn and landed on top of more bricks. It definitely bent the frame of my vehicle and destroyed all the sensors in the front ($20000+ damage easy).

I later received a bunch of suspicious phone calls from an unknown Florida phone number but not sure if this is a coincidence because I asked my lawyer if in Canada anyone can get your contact info from a license plate and he said absolutely not.

My list of emotions range from disgusted with myself, to embarrassed, scared, sorry, and just wanting to take it all back. This guy might have access to my address, maybe contact info, and everything else linked to my car registration. Again, I have no idea how this is possible as Canada privacy laws only allow governmental systems to look this info up.

How do I ultimately move on from this? I am so shaken up and I feel like I don't know myself and what I'm capable of.

Got a msg that things were already starting to sell by the time I got in, so looked through pretty fast.

Ordering was super smooth though. The site was good, no hiccups, and checkout was clean. 

I like how easy it was to grab a variety of beans, especially from roasters I wouldn’t normally get this kind of selection from. Each bag is small, priced right, and makes for a low-commitment way to try a ton of different coffees. I think I accidentally ordered double of one coffee but whatever, I’m not mad about it. Will post thoughts on each bean as I brew through the samples.

Ended up grabbing a solid lineup:

**Datura Coffee:**  
- Finca Hartmann LOT 2 Guarumo Estate Natural (20g)  
- 24/098 Oma Natural Gesha Village (20g)  
- La Palma Y El Tucan Heroes Gesha Lactic (20g)  

**B&W:**  
- Yeltsin Sagastume - COE 20 (20g)  
- The New School (20g)  
- Julio Madrid - Nitro Caturra (20g)  

**DAK:**  
- Jhonatan Gasca - Thermal Shock Pacamara (20g)  
- Grape Lace - Guatemala (20g)  
- Jazz Fruits - Ethiopia (20g)  
- Kumquat Squat - Ethiopia (20g)  
- Darling Peach - Ethiopia (20g)  
- Coco Bongo - Colombia (20g)  
- Banana Split - Colombia (20g)  

**AMOC:**  
- /045 Ecuador — Galo Morales (50g) 


Excited to try all of these, especially some of the wild process coffees. This kind of drop format just makes sense. Easy access to a huge variety without committing to full bags, and the lineup is stacked. Already looking forward to dialing these in.

Thanks.

Query:

Dear \[...\]:

In an old apartment by the bayou, Peter spends his days alone, blaring mopey jazz records and wondering if we all just get a little bit lonelier over time. But after he learns about a missing girl from his neighborhood, his isolation turns to curiosity, and he starts asking questions. Henry, Peter's retired gardening buddy, knows her from church. He's an expert in the art of detection—he's seen it on TV.

When the girl turns up dead at the neighborhood church, Peter is crushed with guilt. He should have done more to help. Peter befriends the murdered woman's sister, Michelle. The police haven't done much, and she's glad to find someone who cares. Peter’s glad to find someone to talk to who isn’t Henry.

As Peter and Henry stumble through their investigation with more enthusiasm than skill, a suspect turns up dead, and an aggressive detective takes over the police investigation. She has zero time for amateur-hour nonsense.

When a note warns Peter to stay away from Michelle, he realizes the cops aren’t the only ones watching him. If he gives up, he risks failing Michelle (and himself) all over again. If he keeps digging, he may put everyone he loves in danger.

THE SIDEWAYS MAN (80,000 words) is a mystery that would appeal to readers who enjoy the ensemble thrill of Elly Griffiths (THE POSTSCRIPT MURDERS) and the dark, witty vibe of Chris Offutt (SHIFTY’S BOYS) or Jonathan Ames (A MAN NAMED DOLL).

First 300:

  
Shortly before sunrise, Peter Pizzuto gazed out his window at the park where a woman with a red bicycle stood beside the rusty grill. She was burning twigs and trash, warming her hands over the small fire. He liked watching her little ritual. There was something hidden in it, some secret bliss he couldn’t have.

He knew her name now—Ellen—but little else about her. What was her story? Was she homeless? Peter felt a pang of guilt. Why should that matter? It was a public park—she had every right.

Peter pushed his thin wire glasses up the bridge of his nose, looked down at his plain composition notebook, and wrote: *Even though it is warm.*

Peter Pizzuto enjoyed looking out the window. Most of the time, there was nothing to see, which was fine with him.

 

It was noon, and Peter had run out of excitement for the day (he’d run out of coffee hours before). He rubbed his bald head, pulled a nicotine lozenge from his pocket, and crushed it between his teeth.

The label on the little tube of lozenges explicitly warned against chewing them, but Peter found it so satisfying to feel the little thing crunch, leaving the minty dust to dissolve on his tongue. Like smoking, it was only a ritual, and within minutes, the brief aura of minty enjoyment had faded.

His cat, Anna Magdalena, pounced on his laptop. She purred, stuck her tail in his face, and kneaded the keys, entering a short paragraph of jumbled letters into a spreadsheet of little importance.

“Are you trying to help?” said Peter, gently moving her off the laptop.

“Meow.”

“You don’t mean that.”

“Meow.”

“That’s dark… and true.”

A scoop of dry food, a smaller scoop of wet food, and a splash of water from the faucet. It had to be all three in equal proportions, or else Anna Magdalena might throw up—she was indiscriminate about where she did so.",1,1740102246.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

When I got around to serving said customer there was another customer next to her who was using the self-scan machine and she thought it was appropriate to just shove him because he was ""in the way"". Of course I told her off about it, said that it was unacceptable to push other folk out the way and that if she wanted him to move a bit out of the way then all she had to do was ask (he was slightly leaning a bit but not to the point where he was actually in her way). This cow then started accusing me of taking his side and had the utter front to actually justify assaulting another customer because ""If he was in your way you would do the same thing"". She was just unpleasant to deal with all round and I couldn't have been happier to have served her sooner so that she could leave.

All at the same time, a customer dropped a bottle of wine by the beer aisle, the next customer had TWO TROLLEYS full of items but found out they could only afford one of them after I already scanned everything so I had to void their shopping item by item until I got to the item they wanted to buy, and another customer actually tried to scan a cup of coffee on the other self-scan (spoiler: you can't as they don't have bar codes and are an option on the self-scan) and thought tipping it on its side and drenching the machine would get it to scan.

At this point I was done. A shop full of ignorant, arrogant, stupid, entitled customers which was the bane of my 8 hours and these four were the worst of the lot in a span of 5 minutes.",3,1740102149.0,retailhell,1,1.0,False

Turns out it is possible!,"After being stuck in a constant state of fear for around 10 ish~ years since I was around 11/12 today I finally got out of survival mode for a long time. 

I’m in college right now and on top of not really having a good healthy basis as a child I was really struggling to be grounded in the present moment to focus on what’s important. I have been subconsciously spiraling over the past few months and have been diagnosed with MDD and GAD. Yesterday I ended up numbing my feelings out with video games and feeling really bad about it- I was in a depressed, anxious haze when I got back to my apartment. It kind of snapped to me where I realized I should be doing better for myself and my girlfriend; just because some bad things happened to me in the past doesn’t mean I don’t have the power to change my life in the future. 

Since I didn’t really do anything super tiring that day I spent the entire night up to 5 AM cleaning up the remnants of my depressive spiral- doing dishes, picking clothes off the ground, taking out the trash. I wanted to make my girlfriend feel good because she’s in the middle of being burned out so I figured she’d really appreciate the house being clean and her coffee which I made a 5 AM store run for. 

Today I woke up at 1 PM and felt better than I did yesterday. Usually I’d feel awful after waking up at 1 PM but in a way doing chores around the house for myself and my girlfriend made me feel in a way, more connected to the world.  

And then it all happened. Through feeling happy I could feel more emotions in my body that I was disassociating from. There were the old feelings of pain, fear, and sadness, but there were also feelings like happiness, contentment, and relaxation. It felt like the ball was back in my court after a long time of me being in the passenger’s seat while my trauma was driving. I felt like I could just be in the present moment without any obligation. Being disconnected from your body for a long time made me bad at noticing my body’s needs, but now I could feel that I was hungry, thirsty, and needing rest. After doing all that I felt better and more whole instead of empty. 

I am going to practice more grounding exercises. Cheers to a better future.

Im not allowed to have him sleepover at my house and we live about an hr appart by the time he comes over to my place hes so tired from homework, chores, and transit travel ( neither of us dont have car) its a struggle to get things intamte. usally he falls asleep. :/ and his parents call asking where he is so he cant stay late. At his place is even harder his room is two double push doors very unsound proof and his parents have no boundries. They come in all throughout the day asking for him to do things or calling him to do things. As well as they do not know that we do things and when they asked my bf before he had to refuse since they are conservitive. His father works from home most days (in office mon-wed come home early somtimes randomly) and only sits a few meters away from his room so theirs no way. On the other hand the mother comes home very late at night 11:30-12pm and doesnt go to sleep till 1:00am-2:00am. she will be telling him things to do until she goes to sleep even late at night bothering us. so then by 1:30 am we can maaayyybe start thinking about doing thing but from helping out with his chores and it being so late at night we're both too exsuasted to do anything. ( and he doesnt drink coffee so its not like we can do that plus then we wouldnt be able to sleep) At this piont its been a struggle to do anything and every weekend we hang out bc we have school durring the week intamacy just gets skiped. we both wanna do it but we end up just passing out. I asked him to at least try talking to his parents about boundires but since they are workoholic immagrant parents they dont understand/ listen. (even with unrelated topics) we're too broke to get our own place bc we cant work full time bc of school. Note:things didnt used to be like this  they haev been getting seemingly more overbearing last few months since i think they've become more confterble when im there. which is good but not for our intamte life. i love my bf and his parents but it seems like its rlly starting to affect us esspeally me bc its important for me.

1iuew9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1iuew9c/32_m4f_michigan_seeking_a_genuine_connection_with/,32 [M4F] #Michigan Seeking a genuine connection with an older woman.,"Hey there!

I’m a 32-year-old guy from Michigan looking to connect with an older woman for meaningful conversation, laughter, and whatever else may come naturally. I’m drawn to confidence, wit, and a good sense of humor—someone who enjoys great conversation and isn’t afraid of a little sarcasm.

A little about me: I’m 5’11”, athletic build, with green eyes and brown hair. I love the outdoors, cooking, reading, and spending time with friends. In the winter, I enjoy cozying up with a good book or binging a great show with coffee in hand. I’m laid-back, affectionate, and love to laugh. My love language is physical touch, so if you're someone who enjoys cuddles, that’s a plus!

I’m looking for something that feels natural—whether that’s friendship, a deeper connection, or something more. If you’re an older woman who enjoys good conversation, adventure, and a little fun, shoot me a message! Let’s see where things go.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

1iuevi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1iuevi9/looking_for_title_and_link/,Looking for title and link,"I tracked my husband Cole and found out that he went to his assistant Elsa 's house.
Elsa's baby bump is unmistakable.
Everything felt like it was moving in slow motion as she wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him down into a smooch.
 It was too much. It was suffocating. 
Cole was cheating on me.With Elsa.And she was pregnant.
""Stay cool, Sara. You're stronger than you think. You can get through this.""
I straightened my posture and wiped the tears from my face, a sudden surge of determination rising within me.
————————
SARA
""Do you know where Elsa is?"" I asked my assistant Dona. She shook her head.
""I've been looking for her all morning."" I glanced at Elsa's desk. ""But she was here, right?""
""Yes,"" Dona said. ""I saw her come in, but then she took the elevator—probably heading to the lobby to grab something to eat.""
""Yeah, that sounds like her. The baby probably demanded to be fed,"" I chuckled. ""Let me know as soon as you see her, okay?""
""Sure thing, boss."" Dona gave me a playful salute.
I glanced at my watch—9.40 a.m. Our office started at 9. What had Elsa been doing in the lobby for that long? Frowning, I turned and headed back to my office.
Seated behind my desk, I opened my email. Thirty unread messages stared back at me, and for a moment, a wave of overwhelm washed over me. This was exactly why I needed Elsa—at least a third of these fell under her responsibilities. As my finance manager, she was the one who handled expenses and invoicing. She was supposed to help me sort through this mess.
I had no idea how I was going to manage when Elsa took her twelve-weeks maternity leave. My interior design firm was small—a subsidiary of Cole's real estate development company—with only a handful of employees. Losing my finance manager for that long felt like a looming crisis.
Sighing, I started reading the first email.
Everything had been going smoothly—until I reached the eleventh email. That's when I hit a problem I couldn't solve on my own. Glancing at the clock on my laptop, I saw it was already 10:15 a.m.
And Elsa still hadn't come back.
Or had she returned to her desk, and Dona just forgot to tell me?
I got up from my seat and stepped out of my office, my eyes immediately landing on Elsa's empty desk. Still not here.
I turned my attention to Dona, who was deeply engrossed in her typing, her pink headset on, unaware of my presence. I tapped her shoulder gently. She looked up at me, lowering the headset.
""Is Elsa coming back yet?"" I asked.
Dona shook her head. ""I haven't seen her. If she did, I surely have noticed.""
Yeah. Of course. Elsa needed to pass by Dona's desk to get to hers.
""Try to call her, please.""
""I did."" Dona said. ""She didn't pick up.""
""Try calling the security downstairs. I worried something happened to her. She's about to have the baby soon.""
""I saw Elsa heading to the second elevator row,"" Angie, another team member, suddenly said as she arrived at her desk across from Dona. She must have just returned from a meeting.
""Probably going to your husband for some budget approval.""
I frowned. I hadn't asked Elsa to do anything like that. Why would she go there?
Angie glanced at me, a knowing smirk tugging at her lips, which made me suspicious. ""You didn't send her?""
""No,"" I said, shaking my head. A strange feeling crept into my chest. Why would she go to Cole?
Dona, who had been silent until now, looked up from her laptop. ""Maybe she took the initiative? Or maybe she needed some advice?""
""Still, she should've run it by me first,"" I muttered, reaching for my phone. My fingers hovered over the screen, debating whether to text Elsa. I turned to Dona. ""I'll be in my office. Let me know if she comes back.""
Dona nodded.
As soon as the door to my office closed, I called Cole. He didn't pick up. I tried again. After the third ring, he finally answered.
""Hi, babe,"" his voice came through the speaker, warm but distracted.
""Honey, I'm looking for Elsa. Is she there?""
A brief pause. ""She was here this morning, but she already left.""
I frowned. ""Why did she come to see you?"" I couldn't quite hide the suspicion in my tone.
Elsa was technically an employee of the parent company, not mine, which meant she reported to Cole. But she had been assigned to assist me in monitoring finances. If she had something to report, the professional courtesy would have been to consult me first.
Cole sighed. ""She wanted to go over some numbers before submitting them. She said it was urgent.""
I clenched my jaw. ""And you didn't ask if I already gone through them?""
Another pause. Then a sigh. ""I told her I'd review them first. We can review them together if you want.""
That didn't make me feel any better. ""But she didn't say anything to me."" I said. ""Which numbers did she talked about?""
Cole didn't answer me. ""Cole?""
""The Jamison project."" He finally answered. ""Babe, sorry, I'm a bit distracted. I'I have an urgent email I need to send. I'll talk to you tonight, okay?""
""Okay,"" I replied slowly. ""Love you,""
""Love you too.""
He closed the call.
I returned to my emails, forcing myself to focus on the reports and requests piling up in my inbox. But the nagging feeling in my chest refused to fade, a persistent distraction that made concentration impossible. My eyes skimmed over the words on the screen, but my mind kept circling back to Elsa.
Why would she go to Cole for something without discussing it with me first? It felt like she didn't trust me. This was my husband's company, for God's sake—I could just ask him in bed tonight.
I needed answers. I dialed Cole's number again.
No answer.
Frustrated, I pushed back from my desk and walked out of my office. ""I'm stepping out for a bit,"" I called to Dona as I headed for the elevator. ""Be back after lunch.""

SARA
It might have been my imagination, but everyone was acting strangely.
Lawrence, Cole's PA, stared at me with wide eyes and an open mouth, as if bracing for impact. I glanced at my right—Maisie, Cole's secretary, was also staring. Both of them had risen from their seats to greet me, something they had never done before. Ever.
I didn't come to Cole's office often, but I had been here enough to know that something was definitely off with them.
""Uh... what?"" I had to ask. This was getting weird.
Lawrence and Maisie exchanged a quick, uneasy glance before snapping their attention back to me.
They shook their heads.
I shrugged, then continued my walk.
""Cole's in a meeting,"" Lawrence said abruptly. ""An overseas conference call. It might take a while.""
""Oookay..."" I trailed off, coming to a stop, my gaze drifting to the chair across from Lawrence's desk. ""Then I'll just wait here.""
Maisie shifted uncomfortably, casting a quick glance at Lawrence before returning her gaze to me. ""I think it's okay if you go in,"" she said, her voice slightly shaky. ""It's an important meeting, but you're his wife, so...""
She trailed off as she and Lawrence exchanged another uneasy glance.
""But it could take hours,"" Lawrence added, a little too quickly.
I narrowed my eyes. ""And?""
Maisie forced a smile. ""Lawrence probably just doesn't want you to waste your time.""
I crossed my arms. ""I don't mind."" Pulling out the chair across from Lawrence's desk, I sat down, making it clear I wasn't going anywhere. ""I can wait here.""
Lawrence exhaled slowly, his fingers twitching against the desk. Maisie looked like she wanted to say something but pressed her lips together instead.
Something was definitely off.
I frowned, my gaze bouncing between the two of them. ""Okay, what is going on?""
Maisie hesitated, staring at me for a long moment before finally sighing. ""Just go in, Sara. It'll be fine.""
Lawrence shot her a sharp glare, but she didn't acknowledge it.
My eyes stayed on Maisie, trying to decipher the strange, almost resigned expression on her face. Seriously. What's going on?
Slowly, I rose from my seat and walked toward the door, hyper-aware of their eyes tracking my every move.
My fingers curled around the handle, and for a split second, I hesitated. Then, I pushed the door open.
Cole stood by the floor-to-ceiling window behind his desk, one hand in his pocket, the other holding his phone. His suit jacket was draped over the back of his chair. At the sound of the door, he turned. His face was calm, composed—but there was something in his eyes that made me pause.
But I wasn't sure what. Maybe it was just in my head.
I pushed the thought aside and shut the door behind me. ""Hey,"" I said.
""Hi babe,"" Cole offered me a soft smile.
I glanced around the room—empty. Just the two of us. ""I thought you were on an important call.""
""I was,"" he said, swallowing. ""It's done already.""
""Lawrence said it might take hours,"" I pressed.
""We solved the problem quicker than I anticipated.""
""Oh, good."" I walked closer, and he stepped around his desk, pulling me into his chest before pressing a smooch to my cheek.
""What brings you here?"" he asked.
""I want to talk about Elsa.""
His dark blue eyes flickered—confusion, maybe. ""Elsa?""
""Yeah. I'm not comfortable with her coming to you behind my back. The Jamison project isn't that important to seek advice directly from you.""
""It's not?"" His eyes widened slightly.
""It's just a small renovation. Why did she bother you with it?"" And it was not that urgent.
Cole let me go, stepping back toward his desk before sinking into his chair. ""I don't know, Sara. She probably needed advice.""
I walked over and took a seat across from him, my eyes locked on him. ""What kind of advice?""
""I didn't have the time, so I asked her to just email me.""
My eyes narrowed. ""She didn't even tell you anything about the project?""
Cole shook his head.
That wasn't like Cole. He was meticulous, pushy, and a complete control freak. He never left things to chance—he would want to know every detail. Anyone on his team would spend hours preparing and gathering information before approaching him. Elsa would need to prepare a lot, and she would need to go through me, before going to Cole. So, for Elsa to suddenly go to him one morning, and for him not to bother asking anything, was unusual.
I remember him saying on the phone ""She wanted to go over some numbers before submitting them. She said it was urgent.""
It was even more unusual for him to review preliminary numbers before they were finalized. Cole only wanted to see the final figures. No one dared to submit a draft.
I decided to test him. ""What do you think about the budget we proposed?""
""I told you, I didn't have time to go through it,"" he said, his voice tight.
Still not giving me an answer. Which I didn't understand. Why was he acting like this?
Did Elsa complain about me? To my own husband? Had I made a mistake in my plan?
I kept pressing. ""But surely, she showed you something if she came all the way here,"" I said, then added, ""Without even telling me.""
Cole was studying me. ""Why does it bother you so much, Sara?""
""Because,"" I sighed, feeling a twinge of doubt. Maybe I was being ridiculous. ""It feels like she doesn't trust me. She went straight to you without consulting me. I can't work with someone like that, and I don't have the time to focus solely on developing her.""
I glanced at Cole and found his gaze had softened—almost sad, in fact.
It felt like he was feeling sorry for me—like he thought I lacked the leadership ability to develop my own team.
""She was part of your team before,"" I continued. ""She's used to the fast, structured, and efficient workflow at the parent company—I get that. But my team operates differently. We're smaller, we move at a different pace, and while we may not be as rigidly efficient, we complete our projects with precision and care.""
""You're her boss, Sara. You tell her how you want it to work.""
""Oh, I will tell her,"" I scoffed. ""But I just can't find her. She's missing the entire morning.""
Cole didn't respond, his gaze was still tight and locked onto me.
""Cole."" I leaned forward across his desk, lowering my voice. ""I'm not happy working with her. She's stubborn and uncooperative. My team has complained about her, too. I've given it three months, and nothing has changed.""
Still, he said nothing.
I exhaled, leaning back. ""She's going on maternity leave soon, and I can't run things without a finance manager. This is the perfect time to find a replacement. When she returns, she can work for you again.""
""Okay,"" Cole responded.
""Okay?"" I repeated, couldn't quite believe that he would agree so easily. He was practically forcing her on us.
""Yes,"" He nodded.
""Thank you,"" I smiled. He smiled too.
""Are you going to have lunch with Bobby?"" He asked.
""Yes,"" I answered.
Bobby and I had our usual lunch at least twice a week at the park across from our office building. We'd grab burgers or tacos from street vendors, sit on a bench, and watch people pass by while Bobby made snide comments about their outfits. She was unapologetically blunt.
""Okay, have fun with her."" He smiled tenderly. ""Come here and give me a smooch.""
I got up and walked around his desk, and when I was in front of him, he pulled me into his lap. ""I love you,"" He whispered, before he pressed his lips against mine, lingering there for a while.
""I love you too."" I said to him, my heart softening.
We said goodbye, and I headed for the door. But just before walking out, I glanced back at him and gave a small wave.
That's when I noticed it.
A small pouch sat on the coffee table in the sitting area.
Pink.
The same one Elsa always carried with her everywhere.
That meant Cole had a meeting with Elsa not on his work desk. But on the sofa.
And that bothered me. A lot.
I glanced back at my husband, but he was already on the phone, discussing something about a takeover.
Frowning, I looked at the pouch again, deciding I would ask him about it later when we were home.
And then I heard something. A sound. Like something had fallen to the floor.
I brushed it off and kept walking, only to find Lawrence and Maisie watching me intently again. My eyes narrowed at them, but they didn't say anything. I could still feel their stares on me as I made my way to the elevator.
As the car began to descend, a thought suddenly crossed my mind.
The sound had come from my right.
The right side of the room had the sitting area—and the door that led to Cole's private bathroom.
But Cole had been sitting at his desk on the left side of the room.
There couldn't have been someone in that bathroom the entire time I was there... could there?
-
Bobby was saying something about a girl in a red dress—something about it making her look like she had a third tit—but I couldn't focus on her words.
My mind was still on that pink pouch—and that sound.
I was losing my mind, trying to make sense of it all.
And Elsa's pouch was right there.
Elsa—the pregnant, unmarried, gorgeous woman.
Bobby's eyes trailed a woman wearing a massive bow on her back. ""I sincerely respect the commitment to bad fashion,"" she mused, still watching her. ""That took guts.""
I didn't respond.
She poked my waist, pulling me from my thoughts. I glanced at her—my best friend, with her striking red and purple hair—raising an eyebrow.
""What's wrong with you?"" she asked. ""You've been zoning out for over an hour now.""
I shook my head. ""Nothing.""
""Your face says otherwise."" She frowned. ""Spill it.""
I wasn't sure if I should tell her. I didn't even know if this hunch—this suspicion—was real or just in my head.
Bobby was one of Cole's best friends from college. There were four of them—Steve and Archie were the other two—and they were inseparable.
Bobby and Cole had built their careers side by side, backed each other through every success and failure, and knew each other better than anyone else. Loyalty ran deep between them. If I told Bobby what was on my mind, there would be a good chance it would get back to Cole.
Bobby was also Cole's second-in-command, the only person he fully trusted in his company. She had helped him build both businesses from the ground up, leading the real estate agency while Cole handled development. They worked so seamlessly together that it sometimes felt like they could read each other's minds.
Steve was Cole's go-to lawyer, handling all legal matters exclusively. When Cole insisted on having him despite Steve being a junior associate at the time, the firm resisted, but Cole's business was too valuable to lose. Since then, they had worked together flawlessly.
Archibald, a journalist, was the most elusive of the group. His work kept him away for long stretches, and he rarely spoke about it. We only learned about his stories once they hit the news. His discretion was unwavering, and we eventually stopped asking.
I had grown close to them, especially Bobby, but they had been Cole's friends first. And sometimes, when doubt crept in, I couldn't help but wonder where their loyalties truly lay.
Bobby was still watching me, waiting for an answer.
""You know Cole very well, don't you, Bobby?"" I asked quietly.
She nodded, confusion flickering across her face.
""He would never betray me... would he?""
Bobby looked taken aback. ""Why would you even ask that?""
I looked away, giving a small shrug. ""Just asking.""
She held my gaze. ""He loves you, Sara. You know that.""
""I know.""
But still... that nagging feeling wouldn't go away.
I was about to say something, but a voice behind me cut in.
""I see you two still have lunch in the park.""
I perked up immediately, recognizing the voice. Bobby, however, tensed beside me.
Turning around, I came face to face with a tall guy—platinum blond hair, mesmerizing green eyes, and tattoos creeping over his collar—grinning at me.
""Archie!"" I squealed, jumping up from the bench. I spun around and threw my arms around him. He let out a chuckle, wrapping me in a tight hug before lifting me off the ground for a second.
""Miss me, Peaches?"" he teased, setting me back down. He'd been calling me Peaches for as long as I could remember, and he never once told me why. I had stopped asking long ago because he always dodged the question.
I rolled my eyes but couldn't stop smiling. ""It's been forever! Where have you been?""
""Somewhere in the middle east."" He said simply. His gaze flicked to Bobby, who was still seated, arms crossed, watching us with a blank expression.
Knowing him, that was probably the best answer I was going to get. So, I just nodded, choosing not to press further.
""Hi, jerk,"" Bobby said to him.
""Bobby,"" he drawled, tilting his head. ""Still as charming as ever, I see.""
Bobby huffed, shooting him a look. ""Still as annoying as ever, I see.""
There was history between these two—messy, complicated history. A year ago, they slept together, which they both knew was a mistake. It had the potential to ruin their friendship, and Bobby had gone ahead and shattered it completely by dumping Archie and then sleeping with Julian, his younger brother, instead.
Her excuse was simple—Archie never loved her anyway. His heart had always belonged to another woman.
I never probed further. It wasn't my business.
I spotted my husband striding toward us, scowling at his best friend. ""That's enough,"" Cole growled, flicking a hand in warning. ""Get your filthy hands off my wife.""
Archie's hands flew up as he let go of me.
""Hey, baby,"" Cole greeted, leaning down to press a smooch to my lips.
""Don't I get a smooch too?"" Archie quipped.
""Not in front of my wife,"" Cole shot back, smirking.
Archie chuckled.
""How's lunch?"" Cole turned to me, looking at me affectionately.
My mind went to that pouch and that sound again. I couldn't get it out of my head.
""It's fine."" I said tensely.
His brow furrowed in concern, noticing something was off with me. ""Something's wrong?""
Before I could answer, his phone buzzed. He took it out of his coat's pocket and glanced at the screen.
""Hold that thought,"" he said, picking up the phone. ""Yeah?"" His expression shifted, his voice tightening. ""I'll be there soon... Just wait for me.""
Cole glanced at me, remorse flickering in his eyes. ""I'm sorry, babe, I have to go.""
He had already turned away, about to walk off, when I called after him. ""Where?""
""Some crisis,"" he said briskly, and started to jog. ""I'll explain when I get home.""
He sprinted across the park toward the reserved parking lot in front of the lobby, leaving me standing there, completely stunned. I barely had time to process what had just happened before I turned to Archie, who was already watching me with confusion.
""What?"" he asked. ""What are you thinking?""
I was frozen for a moment, my eyes shifted again, tracking Cole's car as it sped through the driveway. Then, suddenly, I bolted.
""Sara!"" Archie and Bobby called out in unison, trailing behind me. ""Where are you going?""
I didn't answer. I had a bad feeling about this. Call it intuition, but I needed to see this through. Reaching the curb, I frantically searched for a taxi.
""Sara, where are you going?"" Archie shouted, but I ignored him, waving down an approaching cab.
Miraculously, an empty taxi pulled up in front of me. I yanked the door open and jumped in. ""Follow that car!""",1,1740101111.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

I would get them every so often maybe if I drank too much the night before. Gradually it’s gotten worse, I had to completely cut things like coffee and then alcohol out of my life, getting dizzy as soon as I drank them. I was given propanol and it worked for a while but all of a sudden one day last month it completely stopped working, when I went to the doctors about this she decided I should stop taking it all together as she believed it was slowing my heart down too much. My heart palpitations have gotten so bad I can’t even work out for 15 minutes anymore, I dread waking up every day, I cannot sleep at night I constantly feel dizzy, sick and my chest gives me so much anxiety. I have been checked for a chest x ray, I wore an ECG for 72 hours and all have came back clear, been up to A and E constantly with no problems. I’ve been to doctors/hospital over 20 times in the past year or so about this and have made absolutely no improvement, they seem completely at a loss. I don’t know what to do anymore I have cut everything out of my life that could be causing these and now the propanol has been taken off me I’m scared I will feel like this everyday for the rest of my life. I went to therapy when I was younger (unrelated to the palpitations, my dad passed away) so I know a lot of breathing techniques and they don’t really help at all.

It's one of those large, high-end machines where you simply select your preferred coffee, and it dispenses it for you.Before starting the system cleaning cycle, you need to remove the tube from the milk, connect it to a spout, and then plug it into the front of the coffee machine so it can cycle water through.So I started the system cleaning on the coffee machine as usual when I noticed that the milk tube had come loose from the spout from the pressure and it started spilling water on the table. Thinking it might not have been properly attached, I secured it back in place and went on with my task.
As I stood there, wiping down the exterior of the machine, I was caught completely off guard, the spout shot off, and in an instant, my face was drenched in hot water. Startled, I took a step back, trying to make sense of what had just happened. It seemed like pressure had built up in the tube, forcing it to pop off with force. And making the water come flying out and straight up into my face.
Could it be that the tube, or something else inside, was starting to clog? I took a quick look, but there was nothing visibly obstructing it. Then again, not all of the tubing was in sight…I report the issue to maintenance and continue with my shift. The next night, I follow my usual routine and begin the cleaning cycle. But this time, I make sure to step back a good distance from the machine as it starts up. Sure enough, the spout suddenly flies off, and water sprays up into the air. Thankfully, I was clever enough to stand further back this time.",19,1740100302.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,2,0.95,False

I am one of the minority who started drinking coffee because I just enjoyed the taste! I would be lying if that's the only reason, I do enjoy the caffeine, but oddly enough, I started mixing my beans for half decaf so that I could drink more coffee without the side effects from too much caffeine.

Why? Because there are many health benefits to coffee! Studies have shown that drinking more coffee, up to about 3-4 cups per day, is associated with improved health outcomes! Unfortunately, many people drink it for the caffeine and feel the need to fill it with cream and sugar in order to tolerate it. While there are still some benefits from the coffee itself, the added cream and sugar has unfortunate negative health outcomes and drinking 3-4 cups double-double's each day (if newly added to a person's diet with no other nutritional changes) would directly result in about 2 lbs of weight gain PER WEEK!

So - do yourself a favor and try this simple trick to make black coffee more enjoyable to the average drinker. Add a pinch of salt! It sounds weird but why should it be any different than adding salt to food? It can take a harsh and bitter tasting coffee and make it milder and easier to drink for someone who doesn't usually like black coffee. If you can make the switch to black coffee, you can enjoy the numerous benefits of coffee only limited by the side effects of caffeine; or just go decaf or partially decaf!

Firmware Validation Engineer After a Year of Unemployment,"https://preview.redd.it/14yenlpo6eke1.png?width=5100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8d467bed786648fd8a75eda1d57aa7d527225a4

  
Hi All,



I should've posted this a few months ago and I'm really sorry for the delay (But I was busy so don't be too mad). I'm a computer engineer who focuses on embedded testing, mostly in the automotive industry. I was never a great student, never did super cool projects, and have always struggled with mental health stuff and especially executive function/ADHD BS. 



I was laid off in September of 2023 and did not start my new job until November of 2024. I wish I'd tracked how many jobs I applied to in that time, but it was A TON. I made a lot of mistakes when applying to jobs in this time. For about a year I only applied for jobs in my area, a decent sized city with lots of engineering but (almost) no automotive. The next 2 months I applied all over the US and that changed everything. I was finally getting responses. The company I started at is pretty small, privately owned, and the team is only 25 people. I am the only firmware tester on the team, for a pretty serious project, in a way it's really scary, but I'm learning a lot and I like the job so far.



The best advice I have is; It's not a flaw in your character that you're struggling to find a job. The market is a nightmare, recruiters spam emails and never call you back, chatGPT writes job descriptions, and these websites are incentivized to keep people unemployed. 



My biggest mistake when applying to jobs was not understanding the purpose of a resume, and not understanding the people who are looking at my resume. Long story short, a non-engineer often reads it first, if you never get calls back from recruiters you're not impressing them. But impressing recruiters does not get you a job, you tailor it too much for non-technical people and no manager is gonna care about you at all. You need to find a balance.

Other stuff:

1. Please don't use AI, it takes away your control. When you write things yourself you can choose to do small things, like using words in a company's mission.

2. Applying for jobs, is kinda like being a spy. You get to do a little research on companies/people, you can do a little lying, you get to plan how you want to present yourself. It's kinda cool, and I think it's a good way to frame the concept. You need to convince a few VERY SPECIFIC PEOPLE that you're the right choice. I use a different strategy for every resume and every interview.

2a. For example, some schools have religious affiliations (Looking at you BYU). If LinkedIn says someone went to BYU, you know a few things about that person. Don't talk about your IoT coffee maker design, and don't ask about the nightlife in the area. But this is also good to think about for people with military backgrounds, political leanings in the area, and all sorts of other stuff.

3. Constantly rework things and try new changes. I have at least 100 revisions of my resume. The more you see something, the more natural it feels, I had lots of lines in my resume that were poorly worded, but I spent so much time looking at my resume, so now it all sounds normal to me. 

4. Looking in other areas is a good idea. Even if you're not really planning on moving for a job, it can give you more feedback, more practice, and a good ego boost when it goes well. 

5. You need feedback from people around you. This subreddit is great, but you should also get people you know to read it, non-engineer friends, old coworkers, old managers, ect. 



I don't really know what else to say here, I'm happy to answer any questions or go into more detail about specifics.",4,1740100182.0,EngineeringResumes,1,1.0,False

I was given propanol and it worked for a while but all of a sudden one day last month it completely stopped working, when I went to the doctors about this she decided I should stop taking it all together as she believed it was slowing my heart down too much. My heart palpitations have gotten so bad I can’t even work out for 15 minutes anymore, I dread waking up every day, I cannot sleep at night I constantly feel dizzy, sick and my chest gives me so much anxiety. I have been checked for a chest x ray, I wore an ECG for 72 hours and all have came back clear, been up to A and E constantly with no problems.

1iuegun,https://www.reddit.com/r/fearofflying/comments/1iuegun/three_weeks_ago_i_made_a_post_asking_if_i_should/,Three weeks ago I made a post asking if I should cancel my flight. I'm so glad you all encouraged me not to. I was able to fly with minimal anxiety for the first time in ages!!!,"When I was young, I did not have flight anxiety. But at some point in my teens I developed a huge fear of flying. I flew often, however, only because my love for travel outweighed the fear. On *every* plane ride I would analyze every sound/ding/beep and assume everything meant we were going to crash, be unable to sleep or eat, and be on the verge of a panic attack for *hours*.

I planned a trip with some friends a few months ago. **For an entire week before the trip, I felt tense, on edge, and extremely anxious. I cried several times.** [**I asked you all if I should cancel my flight.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fearofflying/comments/1iexxee/convince_me_not_to_cancel_my_flight/) Then the DCA crash happened and I was so close to texting my friends I couldn't go. It also did not help that my flight was with a Boeing (Max) which I felt would be unsafe. With encouragement from you all, and my friends, I refused to cancel the flight and instead made an effort to *confront* my fear.

**I did the following in the span of a week leading up to my flight:**

1. I read two books: SOAR and the Fear of Flying Workbook. I thought both were helpful. For those who have or will read SOAR, I did not do the ""strengthening exercise"" but still found the insights to be helpful overall. These books collectively gave me a pilot's perspective and helped me realize how widespread this fear is. I also liked hearing about the authors' specific experiences working with people who have this fear. The books also give you a great mental image of what the cockpit looks like -- pilots relaxed and in charge, even if there's lots of turbulence (I think one book said the biggest concern is getting coffee on their uniforms when it's bumpy -- i thought this was a great image to keep in mind when things got bumpy)
2. I tried to learn everything I could learn about planes and flying. This was the KEY. It is much harder to be scared of something known than something unknown. I had to make the unknown, known.
   1. I found this random YouTube [account](https://www.youtube.com/@lesposen/videos) by a psychologist, Les Posen, a clinical psychologist who works with patients who have a fear of flying. I found his videos to be calming and informative.
   2. I read posts by the amazing pilots on this subreddit.
   3. I watched and rewatched and rewatched again this [video](https://youtu.be/6V5vw8Di-hM?si=aG8LaYajpHltNsBW) by a pilot who explains all the noises on a flight.
   4. I watched all of ""airplane facts with Max"" videos on Instagram.
   5. I looked at Flight Radar 24 to really sit with the fact that thousands of planes are flying at every moment without issue.
   6. I learned about different types of turbulence from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wQ9nAlO12E).
3. I got seats by the window overlooking the wing. Seats over the wing and near the front of the plane feel the effects of turbulence less.

**I did the following right before the flight:**

1. I took anti-nausea medication because for me, some anxiety comes from feeling nauseous. This helped keep my stomach calm and made me feel less like I was lurching during turbulence.
2. I took magnesium because it helps with my nerves (personally).
3. The SOAR book emphasized that anticipatory anxiety does not equate to anxiety during the flight. So I just accepted that I felt nervous, wrote down my fears, and hoped I would feel okay during the flight.

**I did this during the flight:**

1. Listened to music but did not try to distract myself too much or try to trick myself that I was not flying. This was one of the recommendations from the Fear of Flying Workbook.
2. I made mental notes of what the different sounds and motions meant based on what I learned by watching the videos. This was key to not feeling anxious -- I knew everything that was going on and felt in control. I knew what the flaps did, what the various noises meant, why it feels like the engines quiet down when you reach cruising altitude, what the turbulence was probably caused by, etc.
3. I told myself that *discomfort does not equal danger* (from the Fear of Flying Workbook). Your anxiety will trick you into thinking fear is indicative of danger.

Even though I had been scared TO DEATH for a week, the anticipatory anxiety was 1000000x worse than the flight itself. **I felt CALM on the flight to my destination and back.** It felt unreal because if you asked me a month ago if I would EVER feel CALM on a flight I'd say ""absolutely not.""

***IF I COULD DO IT, YOU CAN TOO!!!*** I know this is not a one size fits all type of thing, but I hope at least some of this post may be helpful to you.",63,1740099947.0,fearofflying,14,0.99,False

Welcome to a world where your lab partner might not insist on getting coffee breaks or complain about lab hours, because it's a supercharged AI, diligently drumming up hypotheses while you sleep. Google’s AI co-scientist doesn't just shine light on dark research alleys; it debates, refines, and ranks ideas, vying to bring the most groundbreaking endeavors to the forefront. It’s essentially an AI-based scientific tournament straight out of a sci-fi novel, engineered to light up the path of discovery with its futuristic glow.

**How It Works: The AI Brainstorm Brigade**

Imagine AI bots huddled around a virtual table, throwing groundbreaking ideas like confetti at a wedding. Here's the breakdown:
- **Supervisor Agent:** The orchestrator channeling the research goal into a feasible workflow.
- **Generation Agent:** Synthesizes the known universe of research into new cosmic ideas.
- **Reflection Agent:** Peer-reviews like the toughest journal editor, ensuring only quality suggestions make the cut.
- **Ranking Agent:** Hosts a scientific showdown, ranking ideas through vigorous debates.
- **Proximity Agent:** Clusters similar insights, cleaning up redundancies like Marie Kondo.
- **Evolution Agent:** Distills and clarifies top-tier concepts, synthesizing them into clarity.
- **Meta-review Agent:** Synthesizes all efforts—delivering a neat presentation to human scientists.

The spotlight is now on AI's ability to support, not replace, human creativity, embodying the spirit of collaboration. Yet, like any good sci-fi plot, there’s a twist. The dual edge of AI—the concern about research integrity with a flood of AI-spawned 'studies'. Let’s remember, with great power, comes great responsibility.

No one understands what we go through, and no one wants the discomfort of sticking around to help or support. Other parents of ASD kids are supportive, but most of us don't have the mental bandwidth to really 'be there' while in the thick of it with our own kids. I thank God for this sub.

I'm 40 and my son is 4.5. Obvious autism by age 1.5 - 2 and diagnosed as L3 last September. I worked really hard with him last fall and was elated when he (barely) scored L2 when reassessed in December. He also started a new preK class with a teacher that actually knows how to handle ASD kids, and mostly NT kids. He has an IEP and gets 30mins of speech and OT in class 2x a week. 

He does great when I'm in a good mood and putting every ounce of energy into being his at-home special ed teacher, but I'm so depleted - in health, mind, spirit. Last year was hell; up until last fall, he was totally out of control and almost non-verbal. He's large for his age and physically imposing. By accident, he broke my nose on Mother's Day and caused other injuries. I wince and brace to be hit or kicked every day, even though he stopped doing that months ago. 

I just picked him up from preK and the teacher said he's been mimicking the really aggressive boys in class. First thing he did when we got him was clock me in the face with his fist. He's never done that before. He's also not potty trained yet, won't eat more than a few foods, and is extremely bossy and stubborn. He fights me On. Every. Little. Thing. 

I know all the things we're supposed to do, I've researched it to death and have talked to so many specialists... It's beyond a full time job. 

My stress is maxed. I no longer have a car (my partner had a bad accident with him in the car last November), I lost my job 2yrs ago and have stayed home with my son ever since. My partner is in full time school to be a musician engineer, isn't working but 'looking' for 3mos now; thinks he's 'above' jobs he qualifies for  like Home Depot, Guitar Center, etc. He's a great dad, but permissive while I try teaching boundaries and obedience. 

We're so poor that we're living off grants and family loans, and the money is about gone. We also live with my 76yro mother, who's slightly narcissistic and emotionally abused me as a kid. Most times I try discussing these fears with my partner - esp the money stuff, since we're fully dependent on him - he tells me I'm ""gaslighting"" and all I've ever done is hinder him while he does school and looks for work. He's extremely impractical with money; rarely helps clean unless asked. He was an alcoholic all his life until rehab a few years ago, so he's very immature and inexperienced at adulthood.

I feel like I have no way out. No freedom; I can't even go on a drive or go buy a coffee because I have no car or money. No prospects. No resume. I have a 2014 BA from UC Berkeley and haven't done anything but housekeeping. I also have autism and ADHD, so I've never been able to handle a 'real' job and be on time, bla bla.

I'm so deeply unhappy. The worst thoughts keep creeping into my mind. If I can't escape or get a break, then I no longer want to be here. My life is over; this fate is sealed. I wanted 2 kids soooo badly. 

Oddly enough, my biggest fear in life was always to be stuck in poverty at my mom's with a special needs child. Welp.",3,1740099649.0,Autism_Parenting,5,0.72,False

I am late-diagnosed and have recently only just started medication - 10mg dex, 5mg at breakfast and 5mg at lunch. They're quite effective and I have had limited side effects, except for one big one: overwhelming nausea.

I am struggling to eat, and I really need to eat. I can't skip meals as it causes epigastric pain, and also blood sugar concerns etc. But my god everything is repulsive. Before this I was an enthusiastic eater, maybe even tipping over into a bit of 'food noise' so this is not normal for me. 

When I was young, I was quite a picky eater. I wouldnt say full blown ARFID, but I had texture issues. All of that has come roaring back. 

I have some other compouding issues - to start dex I had to give up cannabis. I have been a life-time user and obviously cannibinoids affect the gut. Im also finding coffee unhelpful so I've stopped drinking that too, another substance that has gut effects when you quit. So it's fair to say that my digestive system is going through it right now xD 

I am only at day 10 so I wanted to ask others who also had quite intense appetite suppression/nausea what their experience was like. Did you adjust? And how long did it take? Did you have any issues with reflux or having a 'sour' stomach?

Hi everyone,

I’m hoping to get some advice on my current supplement stack. I’ve been struggling with executive dysfunction, low motivation, and poor memory/recall, and I’m trying to find something that actually works without making my anxiety worse. I don’t drink coffee because it makes me too jittery, but I do enjoy black tea or matcha occasionally.

My psychiatrist doesn’t want to prescribe Adderall, and I’ve tried Strattera in the past, but it gave me heart palpitations. So, I’m really trying to find a nootropic approach that can help me get things done, stay organized, and feel more energized without tipping into anxiety.

Here’s what I’m currently taking:

Every Day:
	•	Lion’s Mane (365 Whole Foods Market) – 500 mg
	•	Choline & Inositol (NOW) – Not sure of the exact dose, but I follow the bottle’s recommendation
	•	D3 + K2 (Sports Research) – Plant-based formula
	•	Cordyceps (365 Whole Foods Market) – 500 mg
	•	Niacinamide (NOW) – 500 mg
	•	Methyl B-12 (NOW) – 5,000 mcg
	•	Vitamin A (NOW) – 10,000 IU
	•	Prescriptions:
	•	Venlafaxine (Effexor XR) – 150 mg
	•	Bupropion (Wellbutrin XL) – 100 mg

Sometimes (as needed):
	•	L-Theanine (Solaray) – 200 mg
	•	L-Tyrosine (Solaray) – 500 mg
	•	Gotu Kola (Solaray) – 450 mg
	•	5-HTP with B6 (Vitamin Shoppe) – 50 mg
	•	Bacopa (Solaray) – 100 mg

What I’m Looking For:
	•	Better motivation and focus,  improve executive dysfunction.
	•	Help with task initiation and staying on track.
	•	Improved memory and recall.
	•	Energy without anxiety or crashes.

I moved in with him to help out around the house and keep him company, but I am really worried about his diet. He was on insulin but has not been taking it this last year or so because he switched to a carnivore diet. Doctor gave the OK for no insulin injections.

He stopped taking his statin drugs and metformin about a month ago and hasn't told his doctor. His blood sugar has been 110+ every morning for the last week and he's been getting hateful. I'm really at a loss here. This morning he said his feet hurt and felt swollen!

Then, later this afternoon, he brought back a leftover birthday sheet cake from an event that only had 4 or 5 VERY small pieces cut out. He ate all the rest of it in one sitting then almost immediately started being rude, which prompted me to come here.

I cannot have anything sweet in the house because he will literally gorge himself binge eating whatever it is, unless it is soda (he's a coffee drinker). He has, most nights, gone out to buy 2 or even 4 half gallon containers of Tillamook ice cream and eaten them all at once. I'm completely baffled as to what is driving these binges but I'd rather not have to call 911 because he went into shock.

He frequently will hold his arm above his head before doing the daily wireless blood pressure thing and will only check his blood sugar first thing in the morning.

I'm M 50,  I started last May.We started having friendly conversations and eventually I started to have feelings for her.  This past Christmas I told her I loved her & she said the same & told her I'll see her next week.  Next week she seemed  agitated and said yea I know you love me, she left early and we didn't have a chance to talk. The next week she greeted me with a big hug & called me her love. I've noticed she was a little shy, for the next 3 weeks we would talk & give me great hugs around the waist and neck, finally  asked for her number.  I texted her several times & called her 3 times, I apologized to her for so.many tecg, I thought she would enjoy the little poems.Going forward she didn't answer my texts or call me back but always told me she loved me , hugged and kissed her. I asked her what she wanted for Valentines day she said nothing & seemed upset by the Valentines emoji & at the end of the day I asked her to talk & unfortunately I made a mistake by talking about us at work, she held my hands and I knew I screwed up & she said get home safe. I apologized & she gave me his, kisses  and called me her love. two weekends I told her thru text messages domestic stuff about me and told her I wanted to get together, she told me at work she was busy & seemed agitated and said she was busy.the next week she gave me a hug around the waist & kissed me & had her frienddrive me home.. Last weekend I stood next to her just had a little chit chat , she walked away short distance and said something to another co worker  & said she works 6 or 7 days, I just walked away at the end of she was next to two co worker friends of hers and then I turned around they were gone.after about 40 minutes I clocked  out and I saw them in the parking lot.they said when they left they thought I had left, so they went for coffee & food, I was pissed & she grabbed my hand , called me her love, She didn't know why I was mad & became agitated & walked away.

A couple years ago, I started noticing some issues during academic classes, where I would doze off during class. I didn't think much about it, just thinking I was maybe not the best student. So I began to get coffee, sitting at the front of class, etc, but it was not that helpful. As the years passed, this dozing off had become more common, to the point where I could predict that I would doze off in a class regardless of what I would do about it. It has become a problem since I am also dozing off while behind the wheel. When this occurs, I notice that I start to have an ""aura"", and then doze off while still driving. Looking back, I was vaguely aware of driving, and would briefly become fully aware before dozing off again. And more recently, I've been noticing that I would occasionally wake up with a headache and dizziness. 

I brought these concerns to my PCP and went ahead to get a home sleep apnea test. The test came back negative, but I still am experiencing the symptoms. (Report states In-lab sleep test, MSLT and actigraphy are suggested) My PCP advised me to call the neuro. department of a major hospital in my state, but I have been having difficulty getting an appointment. 

  
Is there any other medical problem these symptoms could be a result from?

1iue2hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iue2hn/i_fought_with_my_30_year_old_brother_physically/,I Fought with My  30 year old Brother physically.,"Long story short i fought my 33-year-old brother. To put this into perspective i am an 18-year-old who just turned 18 and i think i have PTSD. Look the contextual reasons for the fight is as follows, I was basically getting double-teamed by both my sister and brother, my sister was adding fuel to the fire shes is around 16 btw and so I was getting visibly angry by the second I told her repeatedly to stop provoking me and said to her that she was adding fuel to the fire. I have a dysfunctional relationship with both my sister and my brother and so our relationship is very toxic. I slammed the coffee table in anger almost breaking and yet she and her my brother persisted. Because of the hyperarousal of my PTSD, I was getting visibly red and i could feel myself starting to lose control . My PTSD as a disclaimer is undiagnosed but i am showing symptoms and need a therapist but this is a taboo for me and my family due to my Islamic background. My parents are away hence why this fight happened. So long story short after my sister's tirade my brother who is 33 btw started being condescending and mocking me. My sister was pissed at me because i didn't help her carry an 8 litre bottle pack of water which makes me sound like a scumbag but i insisted on 5 liters because it had a place where you could place your hand on it as a means of easily carrying it. She told this to my brother who emasculated me and mocked me for this percieved act of cowardice even though i remonstrated against my sister's decision to do such an absurd thing. So I got pissed at my brother who was the cherry on top to my anger i slammed the coffee table again then i flipped it. My PTSD (undiagnosed) kicks in at this point and i am in fight mode but despite this i go into my room but because of the hypervigilance of my PTSD i perceive that my brother is being aggressive and that he is walking towards my room even after i have entered it and possibly defused the situation. So i leave my room and i see my brother pacing toward me, at this rate nature kicks in and we become beasts rather than men of reason. He headbutts me or vice versa and i shove him aggressively. It's worth noting that i am taller than my brother and yes our age gap is whopping but this is because of my parent's youthful-old marriage which is normal in our culture. I'm 6 foot and kinda close to 6 foot 1 and he's closer to 5 foot 11 but is 6 foot. After the initial clas,h I shove him a fair distance away but I retreat into our doorway in anticipation of a much more brutal fight. My sister only accentuates the affair with her incessant yelling which only occurred during my acts of aggression and not his,btw because she despises me despite us being Irish twins. My brother seems shocked by my aggression but he relents and continues to engage me, at this rate, i push and hold his jumper during the clash and he's funneling me into the doorway which is a corner. In the fight, we knock down the mopping bucket which is used to clean our household and it falls onto my legs slightly wetting my toes and the ground. I willfully stopped engaging my brother while also being defensive as I was cautious of the ramifications if I had killed him. Yes, I did actively battle thoughts of killing him whilst engaging him in the fight. It's a weird feeling because I felt that I could overpower him and get him in a death grip. You dear viewers are most likely concerned about my mental state but i assure you I can judge between good and wrong hence why after he pushes me to the wall next to the doorway i shove him back at this rate he is still holding onto my jacket and i tell him to let go to which he says condescendingly ""go to your room"". Before this during the lull in our engagement, I reminded him of his age (33 )as a means of mocking his actions.

  
Look I am a misanthropic man and i view mankind as acting on the maxim of self interest incessantly hence why i have had feelings of running amok and doing a barbaric act against my family via homicide ideations but I can control these feelings unless someone gratuitously provokes me. My sister mocks me for having an external locus of control and i acknowledge that i need to improve my internal locus of control.I just need advice after this engagement because i am really angry and resentful against my brothers as my anger dissipates sluggishly and also festers within me. My hyperarousal has led me to be in incessant states of fight or flight and i attribute it to the reason why I stood my ground against my brother.I also fought my other brother who is 27 and also stood my ground. I have had conflicts with every member of my family and understand i am responsible for my PTSD even though I cannot control how I got it. My childhood is a contributing factor for my PTSD but also experienced traumatic events. I just need advice guys thats all please be kind.",1,1740098838.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1iue1f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NashvilleBeer/comments/1iue1f7/nashville_brewery_meadery_cidery_food/,"Nashville Brewery (Meadery, Cidery) Food","Having travelled the south a lot lately (often from Nashville to Florida and back), I have noticed something unique about Nashville. Unlike the typical small percent with food throughout other areas, almost all of our breweries have food. Some have chosen to have their own kitchens. Some have permanent popups. And others have permanent food trucks partnering with them. Here is a breakdown (and feel free to add as this is off the top of my head and will require edits).

Breweries with their own kitchens:

* Bassline - Added food in, but had restaurants in the food court and allowed take in since they were Bold Patriot. It is harder calling this a brewery now they are not brewing regularly (still have Bold Patriot recipes).

* Big Machine Brewery & Distillery - At least the Berry Hill location has a full menu. Not sure on the brewery aspect, however. They either contract brew at Blackstone or white label Blackstone/Nashville Brewing beers. (Need to figure this out)

* Blackstone/Nashville Brewing Company - it is a bus and will shut down if lower crowds and no food going out

* Diskin's Cider - Has a limited food menu, which is a bit more upscale (not to Lauter level). 

* East Nashville Beer Works - Pizza, Salads, Sandwiches

* Fat Bottom - Pub grub style menu. 

* Harding House - Partners with Primitive Coffee, which currently has breakfast, but is working on a larger lunch/afternoon menu.

* Living Waters - Limited menu, mostly breakfast

* Rock 'N Dough - Actually more restaurant than brewery. 

* Smith & Lentz - Pizza, Salads, Sandwiches and some upscale appetizers

* Southern Grist, East Nashville - Lauter restaurant. A bit more upscale pub grub (more limited now than when they opened)

* Southern Grist, Nastions - Only Th - Sa currently. Offshoot of Lauter. Food truck (theirs) in the side parking lot.

* Tailgate (all locations) - Pizza, Salads, Sandwiches

* Tennessee Brew Works - Pub menu. Has a very complex burger that is worth trying.

* Tennfold - Pizza, Salads, Sandwiches


Breweries with Permanent Popups inside their Building:

* Bearded Iris Sylvan Supply - Black Dynasty Ramen inside

* Cyanide Cider - Teamed up with Birria Babe (Nadine Moore).

* Fait La Force - JamBox, from Shane Nasby (Cledis), sandwiches with jam spreads on each

* Yazoo - Teamed up with Grillshack for burgers, etc.

Breweries with food truck partnerships:

* Bearded Iris, Germantown - Cabin Attic Burger, although I do need to check as I heard this was switching

* Honeytree Meadery - Bad Luck Burger on site.


Breweries without Food all the time:

* Barrique - Will do popups and trucks when the season is right.

* Black Abbey - Has food trucks regularly on weekends, but nothing full time.

* Broadcast - Only snacks.

* Crazy Gnome - Currently none, but understand the new, bigger location will have food. More later.

* Jackalope - Currently relies on food trucks and has snacks.

* Marble Fox - Attempted a full time, but more snacks now.

* Monday Night - Snack boxes, which really don't count for me.

* New Heights - May have one again, but the previous two partnerships went bust",3,1740098652.0,NashvilleBeer,3,0.81,False
