My Dr put me on this, as I tend to be a mindless eater and Vyvanse is also used for binge eating disorder.

Honestly, it just feels like the party drugs I used to take in my 20‚Äôs. Even at such a low dose, when it kicks in - I just feel so jittery and on the go. I also get super chatty/excited when having a conversation with someone (Luckily I WFH)

Sure, it‚Äôs great to be so productive all day - but it just doesn‚Äôt feel natural and I don‚Äôt feel at ease. People describe their meds as coming out of a blur, but I literally just feel speedy.

My son is on Ritalin SA, so I tried that and even his 10mg tablet made me feel speedy once it kicked in.

And now it‚Äôs 7pm, I just feel exhausted. Which makes sense, as I‚Äôve been on the go since 9am and have done way more in the day than I normally would.

I‚Äôm going to focus on my protein intake this week and I don‚Äôt drink coffee on the days I take my medicine.

I just don‚Äôt know if this is how everyone feels on Vyvanse/stimulants and I need to suck it up, or if I‚Äôm just on the wrong medication. My Dr said she‚Äôll prescribe Concerta as the next option.",1,1730103102.0,ausadhd,0,1.0,False

1gdwvj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RentalCenterCrete/comments/1gdwvj8/food_and_drinks_to_try_in_crete/,Food and Drinks to Try in Crete,"Crete, Greece's largest island, is renowned for its beaches, ancient ruins, and vibrant culture. Its culinary tradition, among the world‚Äôs oldest, emphasizes fresh, local ingredients like fish, mountain herbs, and the famed Cretan olive oil. Distinctive drinks include raki, local wines, craft beers, Greek coffee, and Cretan Mountain Tea, adding to Crete‚Äôs unique appeal.

Listed below are the 11 Famous Foods and Drinks to Try in Crete.

* **Olive Oil**: Olive Oil is known as ‚ÄúLiquid Gold‚Äù. Without it, nothing is cooked. Meats, cheese, salad, veggies, and bread. It is fantastic and covers everything.
* **Raki**: It is the Cretan people‚Äôs national drink. Every meal is nearly automatically followed by its serving.
* **Loukoumades**: The Greek equivalent of doughnuts, are small, fluffy, honey-sweetened balls that are deep-fried until they are ideally golden and crispy.
* **Dakos**: It is a wonderful Greek meze or salad that is similar to bruschetta but is made with barley rusks or paximadi rather than bread.
* **Fried Snails**: Snails, which are pan-fried in their shells and frequently in copious amounts of olive oil or in a bed of salt, are the main component of this traditional Greek dish.
* **Kalitsounia**: classic, a small-sized snack that is both savoury and sweet and originates from the Greek island of Crete. It comes in all different shapes.
* **Paximadi**: Paximadi also referred to as rusks, are the conventional Cretan method of long-term bread preservation. These tiny, hard bread pieces are repeatedly baked and softened by the addition of water or olive oil.
* **Gamopilafo**: Gamopilafo is a rice dish served during conventional Cretan weddings. It is made in a rich meat broth, similar to a deluxe risotto, using long-simmered goat, lamb, or chicken.
* **Sarikopitakia**: Sarikopitakia are pastries with sheep‚Äôs cheese filling that are fried in olive oil and served hot with honey on top. The dough contains tsikoudia, Cretan grape-based alcohol.
* **Lamb Stamnagkathi**: Stamnagkathi with lamb is a traditional meal because it can only be found in Crete. Although it has a small bitterness, the taste is still pleasant. It typically goes well with lamb recipes and is served boiled with olive oil and lemon.
* **Cretan Cheeses**: Cretan Cheeses are often made from sheep, goats, or a combination of the two, and each type of cheese has a regional variation. Best served as a dessert or as a side dish with bread, fruit, and honey.

","I was sitting in a cozy little caf√©, nursing my coffee and reading a book, when I noticed him. He was tall, with broad shoulders and a jawline that could cut glass. His eyes were a piercing blue, and his hair was a mess of golden curls. I couldn't help but stare. He caught my gaze and smiled, a slow, teasing grin that made my heart skip a beat.

""Like what you see?"" he asked, raising an eyebrow as he approached my table.

""Do I have a choice?"" I replied, smirking back. ""You're hard to miss.""

He chuckled, a deep, warm sound that sent shivers down my spine. ""I'm Jack,"" he said, extending a hand.

I took it, feeling a spark at our touch. ""I'm Emma.""

We spent the rest of the afternoon talking, laughing, and flirting shamelessly. Jack was charming, witty, and had a way of making me feel like the only person in the room. As the sun began to set, he leaned in, his voice low and seductive.

""I've been wanting to do this all day,"" he murmured, before capturing my lips in a passionate kiss.

The next day, I found myself at his apartment. He lived in a modern, spacious loft filled with natural light. As soon as the door closed behind us, he pulled me into a tight embrace, his hands roaming over my body.

""You're even more beautiful in the light,"" he whispered, his eyes scanning my face. ""I want to see every inch of you.""

I let out a soft moan as his lips found mine again, his tongue exploring my mouth. He tasted like mint and desire, a combination that drove me wild. His hands slipped under my shirt, tracing the curve of my waist before cupping my breasts.

""You have incredible nipples,"" he groaned, biting gently on one through the fabric of my bra.

I gasped, arching my back to give him more access. ""Jack,"" I breathed, my voice already thick with need.

He grinned wickedly before dipping his head to suck on my nipple through the lace, his hands working to unbutton my jeans. I helped him, kicking off my shoes and stepping out of my pants. He looked up at me, his eyes filled with hunger.

""I want to taste you,"" he said, his voice rough with desire.

I bit my lip, my body already aching for him. ""Yes,"" I whispered, my voice barely audible.

He pulled my panties off slowly, kissing every inch of skin he revealed. When he finally reached my pussy, he looked up at me, his eyes dark with lust.

""You're so wet,"" he murmured, before leaning in to lick me slowly.

I moaned, my hands fisting his hair as he teased me with his tongue. He sucked on my clit, his fingers slipping inside me, and I cried out, my body shaking with pleasure.

""Jack, please,"" I begged, my hips bucking against his face. ""I need you inside me.""

He looked up at me, a wicked smile on his face. ""Not yet,"" he said, his voice low and dangerous. ""I want to make you come first.""

He went back to work, his tongue and fingers driving me to the edge of sanity. I came with a scream, my body convulsing as waves of pleasure washed over me.

""Fuck, Jack,"" I gasped, my body still trembling. ""I need your cock.""

He stood up, his eyes never leaving mine as he undressed. When he finally stepped out of his boxers, I let out a low moan. His cock was thick and long, the head already glistening with precum.

""You're so big,"" I whispered, my eyes wide with anticipation.

He smirked, his cock twitching at my words. ""You can handle it,"" he said, before moving to kiss me again.

I could taste myself on his lips, and it drove me wild. I kissed him back, our tongues clashing as our bodies pressed together. He lifted me up, and I wrapped my legs around his waist, my pussy sliding against his hard cock.

""Fuck me, Jack,"" I begged, my voice hoarse with desire. ""I want you to breed me.""

He growled, his eyes darkening with lust. He carried me to the couch and laid me down, then positioned himself between my legs. I could feel the head of his cock pressing against my entrance, and I groaned in anticipation.

""You're so tight,"" he groaned, slowly pushing into me.

I gasped, my body stretching to accommodate him. He was big, bigger than anyone I'd been with before, but the sensation was incredible.

""More,"" I begged, my hips lifting to take him deeper.

He obliged, sinking into me until he was fully buried inside. I could feel every inch of him, and it was incredible. He started to move, his hips thrusting against mine as he fucked me slowly at first, then faster and harder.

""You feel so good,"" he groaned, his voice ragged with desire. ""Your pussy is milking my cock so perfectly.""

I moaned, my body on fire with pleasure. ""Harder, Jack,"" I begged. ""Fuck me harder.""

He did, his body slamming against mine as he drove into me with force. I could feel my orgasm building again, my body tensing as waves of pleasure crashed over me.

""I'm going to come,"" I gasped, my nails digging into his back. ""I want you to come with me.""

He nodded, his breath coming in ragged gasps. ""I want to come in your mouth,"" he said, his voice low and dangerous.

I nodded, my body still shaking with pleasure. He pulled out of me, his cock glistening with my juices, and climbed on top of me. He kissed me deeply, his cock sliding against my lips as he did.

""Open your mouth,"" he commanded, his voice thick with desire.

I did, and he slid his cock inside, his hips moving as he started to fuck my mouth. I could taste myself on him, and it drove me wild. I sucked on him, my tongue swirling around his shaft as he thrust in and out of my mouth.

""You suck cock so well,"" he groaned, his body tensing as he got closer to the edge. ""I'm going to come, Emma. I'm going to fill your mouth with my cum.""

I moaned around his cock, my body still shaking with pleasure. He groaned, his hips moving faster as he came, his hot cum filling my mouth. I swallowed it all, my tongue licking him clean as he pulled out.

He looked down at me, his eyes dark with lust. ""You're incredible,"" he said, before leaning in to kiss me again.

I kissed him back, my body still tingling with pleasure. ""That was amazing,"" I whispered.

He smiled, his cock already hard again. ""We're not done yet,"" he said, his voice low and dangerous. ""I want to breed you again, and then I want to come on your face.""

I moaned, my body already aching for him again. ""Yes,"" I whispered. ""I want everything you can give me.""

He smiled, his eyes filled with lust. ""Good,"" he said, before positioning himself between my legs again. ""Because I'm going to give you everything you can handle, and more.""",1,1730102916.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False

","I was a regular at the university library, always buried in books, trying to drown out the world. That's where I first saw him, tall, dark-haired, and with eyes that seemed to see right through me. He was a graduate student, a year older than my 19 years, and he had this way of making the air crackle with electricity whenever he was near.

His name was Max, and he was a history major, just like me. We started chatting over coffee after a late-night study session. He was witty, charming, and had this smile that could light up a room. I wasn't sure if I was imagining it, but every time our eyes met, I felt a spark.

A week later, we were having lunch together in the library caf√©. ""You know,"" he said, leaning in close, ""I've always wondered what it would be like to have sex in the stacks.""

I choked on my coffee, surprised. ""You're joking, right?""

He grinned. ""Am I? It's just... there's something so intimate about books, don't you think? And the quiet... the anticipation...""

I felt a shiver run down my spine. ""You're crazy,"" I whispered, but my heart was pounding.

Two days later, I found myself in the dimly lit stacks, alone with Max. He closed the gap between us, his hands gripping my waist. ""You're not going to tell me you're not a little turned on by this,"" he murmured, his lips brushing against mine.

I couldn't argue. I wrapped my arms around his neck, pulling him closer. Our lips met in a fierce kiss, tongues clashing, teeth nipping. He bit my lower lip, and I gasped, feeling a throb between my legs.

He chuckled, low and husky. ""You like that, don't you?""

I nodded, breathless. ""Yes.""

He leaned down, his teeth finding my neck, biting, sucking. I moaned, arching my back. He unbuttoned my shirt, his hands exploring my body, pinching my nipples through the fabric. I cried out, pleasure shooting through me.

He laughed again, a dark sound. ""You're so responsive. I love it.""

I reached for his belt, unbuckling it, needing him. He pushed my hands away, a wicked smile on his face. ""Not yet,"" he said, turning me around so my back was against a bookshelf. He pushed my skirt up, his fingers finding my wetness. I bit my lip, trying to stifle my moans.

He fingered me, slow and deep, his other hand pinching my nipple. I was a mess of sensation, my body aching for more. ""Please,"" I begged.

He laughed, low and throaty. ""Please what?""

""Fuck me,"" I panted.

He spun me around, his eyes burning into mine. ""Say it,"" he demanded.

""Fuck me, Max,"" I whispered.

He smiled, a wicked grin. Then he was inside me, filling me, stretching me. I gasped, my body adjusting to his size. He started slow, his hips moving against mine, his cock sliding in and out of me.

""You feel so good,"" he groaned, his hands gripping my hips.

I moaned, my body moving with his, meeting his thrusts. ""Harder,"" I begged.

He obliged, his thrusts becoming faster, deeper. I cried out, my body on fire. He leaned down, biting my nipple through my bra, and I screamed, an orgasm crashing over me.

He didn't stop, his thrusts becoming more urgent. I could feel him getting closer. ""Cum in my mouth,"" I begged.

He pulled out, his cock in his hand. I dropped to my knees, taking him into my mouth. He groaned, his hands gripping my hair. I sucked him, tasting myself on him, taking him deep into my throat.

""Fuck,"" he groaned, his cock twitching in my mouth. I felt him cum, his hot seed filling my mouth. I swallowed, every drop, looking up at him with a satisfied smile.

He pulled me up, his hands on my face, his cock still half-hard. ""You're incredible,"" he murmured, kissing me deeply.

I smiled, my body still tingling. ""So are you.""

He grinned, his eyes gleaming. ""But we're not done yet.""

He turned me around, bending me over a nearby table. I heard the sound of his belt, then his zipper. I braced myself, anticipating his thrust. But instead, I felt his cockhead against my ass.

""Max,"" I gasped, looking back at him.

He smiled, his cock rubbing against my entrance. ""Trust me,"" he murmured.

I nodded, breathing deeply. I felt him push in, slowly, gently. I gasped, my body stretching to accommodate him. He was gentle, patient, letting me adjust to him.

""You feel so tight,"" he groaned, his hands gripping my hips.

I moaned, my body moving with his, meeting his thrusts. He was fucking me, breeding me, his cock sliding in and out of my ass. I could feel myself getting close again, my body aching for release.

""Harder,"" I begged.

He obliged, his thrusts becoming faster, deeper. I could feel his cockhead hitting my g-spot, sending waves of pleasure through me. I was close, so close.

""Cum on my face,"" I begged.

He groaned, his body tensing. I turned my head, opening my mouth. He pulled out, his cock twitching in his hand. I felt his hot seed hit my face, my mouth, my hair. I moaned, my body convulsing as my own orgasm crashed over me.

We collapsed onto the table, our bodies slick with sweat, our breaths coming in ragged gasps. Max looked at me, his eyes soft. ""You're incredible,"" he murmured, kissing me deeply.

I smiled, my body still tingling. ""So are you.""

","I first met Emily at the local library, where I was a volunteer librarian. She was a regular, always with her nose buried in some classic novel or another. I was drawn to her immediately - her fiery red hair, her freckled nose, and those emerald green eyes that seemed to hold entire worlds within them.

One day, after she'd finished her usual stack of books, she approached me at the checkout counter. ""You know,"" she said, her voice soft but with a hint of mischief, ""you're the only one I've seen here who looks like they actually enjoy being around all these books.""

I smiled, leaning in slightly. ""Well, I do enjoy them. There's something about the quiet, the smell of old paper, the stories... it's like a whole different world in here.""

She laughed, a sound like tinkling bells. ""I know what you mean. It's my favorite place in the world.""

Over the next few weeks, we started talking more. I'd recommend books to her, she'd recommend them back. Then one day, she suggested we grab coffee after her shift at the nearby caf√©. I agreed eagerly, and we spent hours talking about everything under the sun.

That night, I texted her, ""I had a great time today.""

She replied, ""Me too. Maybe we should do it again sometime. And maybe not talk about books.""

I grinned. ""Deal.""

A few days later, I invited her over to my place. She accepted, and as she walked through my door, I could see the spark in her eyes. She looked around, taking in the bookshelves lining the walls, the cozy couch, the warm lighting. ""This is perfect,"" she said, turning to face me.

I stepped closer, our eyes locked. ""I'm glad you think so."" My voice was low, husky. She took a step towards me, her breath hitching slightly. I reached out, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. She leaned into my touch, her eyes fluttering shut.

""You know what I've always wanted to do?"" she whispered.

""What's that?"" I asked, my voice barely audible.

She looked up at me, her eyes filled with desire. ""I want to make love in a library.""

I raised an eyebrow. ""Well, we can't do that here, but I can promise you an experience just as good.""

She smiled, a slow, seductive curve of her lips. ""I'm counting on it.""

I led her to my bedroom, pulling her close as we reached the bed. Our lips met in a hungry kiss, tongues tangling, bodies pressing together. I slipped her dress off, revealing her curves, her soft skin, her hard nipples. I trailed my mouth down her neck, nibbling gently, feeling her shiver against me.

""You taste so good,"" I murmured, licking her collarbone. She moaned, her hands fisting in my hair. I moved lower, taking one of her nipples into my mouth, biting gently. She gasped, arching her back. ""More,"" she breathed.

I obliged, sucking harder, nipping with my teeth. She squirmed beneath me, her breath coming in short gasps. I moved to her other nipple, giving it the same treatment. Her moans grew louder, her body writhing.

I slid my hand between her legs, finding her already wet. I slipped a finger inside her, feeling her clench around me. She threw her head back, a low moan escaping her lips. I added another finger, pumping slowly, feeling her ride my hand.

""Please,"" she begged, her voice hoarse. ""Please, I want you inside me.""

I complied, positioning myself at her entrance. I pushed in slowly, feeling her stretch around me. She moaned, her nails digging into my back. I started to move, slowly at first, then faster, deeper. Our bodies slapped together, the sound of our lovemaking filling the room.

""Harder,"" she panted. ""Fuck me harder.""

I did as she asked, my hips slamming against hers. She met my thrusts with her own, our bodies moving in perfect sync. I could feel her tightening around me, her orgasm building. I reached between us, rubbing her clit with my thumb. She cried out, her body convulsing as she came.

I pulled out just as she finished, her cum dripping down her thighs. I positioned myself at her mouth, my cock throbbing. She opened her mouth eagerly, taking me in. I fucked her throat, her moans vibrating around me. I could feel my own orgasm building, the pleasure intense.

""Swallow it,"" I growled. ""Take it all.""

She did, her throat working as she took my cum. I pulled out, my cock still twitching. She licked her lips, a satisfied smile on her face.

""That was... amazing,"" she said, her voice hoarse.

I feel like I'm in a weird situation regarding this.

I (29M) just saw someone (30F) I know on Hinge, on the Standouts page (so, I can only send her a rose).  
I know her from uni, we were in the same classes in 2017-2018 basically. She did have a boyfriend at the time, I am very surprised to find her on the app!

I met her again by chance in 2022, after an entrance exam. We chatted a bit, I even complimented her, and she agreed to grab a coffee, but we didn't set a specific date due to our schedules (and the entrance exam getting us tired didn't help). I wanted to set it on FB Messenger, which is the only way I have to contact her, but I got surprised because I thought she unfriended me.  
Anyway, I still sent her a LinkedIn request (I signed up there quite recently) with the coffee suggestion as an introduction. No answer.

Well, I just checked both social media right now because I saw her on Hinge: I am pretty sure she just set all her privacy settings really high, given that I can still message her on FB (and can't add her as a friend, which suggests that we already are even though she doesn't appear on my friends list) and she can't be messaged on LinkedIn except if you get premium, even though she's sometimes active there.

So, what should I try?  
I thought of two possibilities:

1. sending her a message on Hinge, joking about how I am still interested in grabbing a coffee
2. sending her a message on Messenger, more candid/natural. I am quite used to getting in touch again with people I know, so that's not a problem for me

1gdwn50,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1gdwn50/is_this_weekly_chores_list_excessive/,Is this weekly chores list excessive?,"Hi all, I have a new housemate who really struggles with taking care of household chores. Since there are 3 of us total in the apartment, we all agreed to keep things simple and rotate between cleaning the kitchen/bathroom/living room areas weekly. My other housemate and I created a detailed list to help ourselves keep track of everything, which we don't think is unreasonable. But our new housemate keeps getting frustrated with us, calling us neat freaks and saying they just don't have the time to keep up (even though they only work part time and are home most often out of all of us...). I understand everyone has their own standards of cleanliness and I'm trying to be respectful of that. But is our list really that much or are they just being lazy? I thought this was pretty basic stuff yet they haven't completed a single weekly checklist since moving in 2 months ago -- There's always *at least* one thing they ""forget"" to do/outright ignore.

Work, home, the same routine ‚Äì it all started to feel unsatisfying. I browsed through various sites, but nothing specific caught my eye. Then, suddenly, I came across the **V**[**ictoria Milan app**](https://shorturl.at/QxAPq). At first, I was skeptical, but the idea intrigued me ‚Äì a place for people in relationships, looking for a bit of a break without commitments.

The thought that I could feel something new and exciting started to take shape. Sometimes, life in a relationship, even with someone you love, can become monotonous. I had been a loyal husband for years, but this app tempted me with the possibility of‚Ä¶ an adventure. Eventually, I signed up and began browsing profiles. After a few days, I came across a woman who stood out. She was 45, married, and was also looking for a bit of escape. We started chatting.

At first, it was innocent enough ‚Äì we shared stories about our lives, our routines, and what we felt we were missing. I could sense through the phone screen that we had similar needs. The more we talked, the more intrigued I became. She was mature, intelligent, confident, and full of warmth that I hadn‚Äôt felt in a while. After a few weeks of messaging, we decided to meet.

Our first meeting was awkward but thrilling. We met for coffee, far from the city, where no one knew us. The conversation flowed naturally, and the chemistry between us was indescribable. We didn‚Äôt need many words ‚Äì a glance, a gesture was enough. The meetings started becoming more regular, evolving into something more than fleeting moments.

This affair lasted three months. I was living in two worlds ‚Äì on one hand, I would go home to my wife, who was completely unaware, and on the other, I had this secret life full of emotion and intensity. I felt like a different person, as if I was rediscovering myself.

After those few enjoyable meetups, I realized that this [**app truly works**](https://shorturl.at/QxAPq) ‚Äì especially when you upgrade to a higher package

But as with these situations, the risk started to overwhelm me. I began feeling more and more guilty, and I couldn‚Äôt shake the thought of what would happen if my wife found out. I started to see her in a new way, in every smile, in the little everyday moments. I realized that despite the routine, she was the person I wanted to grow old with. Finally, I made the decision ‚Äì I ended the affair and decided to focus on my wife, to return to our life.

Of course, it wasn‚Äôt as easy as it sounds. Even though I ended the relationship, I still had to be careful not to give anything away. And then, one day, I almost got caught. My wife reached for my phone when a message came through ‚Äì the last one I hadn‚Äôt yet deleted. My heart was pounding. She looked at the screen, and in a split second, I came up with an excuse ‚Äì I said it was a work message and that I had to leave immediately to handle something important.

Thankfully, she believed me, and I immediately deleted all the evidence. Since then, I‚Äôve kept away from these kinds of adventures. Ultimately, I realized that my wife is my true love and that it‚Äôs not worth risking everything for a fleeting thrill.

So guys, please be careful!",1,1730101216.0,Amateur_Milf_Porn,0,1.0,False
1gdwilt,https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/1gdwilt/chocolate_crinkle_cookies/,Chocolate Crinkle Cookies,"
üßë‚Äçüç≥ INGREDIENTS
2¬Ω cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled off with knife
2 teaspoons baking powder
¬Ω teaspoon salt
5 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped (best quality, such as Ghirardelli)
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into ¬Ω-inch pieces
1 teaspoon instant coffee or espresso powder (optional)
4 large eggs
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup Confectioners' sugar

üßë‚Äçüç≥ INSTRUCTIONS:

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
Combine the chocolate and butter in a small, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring between each bout of heat, until almost melted. The chocolate will continue to melt as it sits. (This technique ensures the chocolate mixture will not get too hot and scorch.) Add the espresso powder and stir until completely melted and smooth.
In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Use a whisk to smash any lumps of brown sugar. Whisk in chocolate mixture.
Add the flour mixture and whisk until evenly combined. (Note that the mixture will be very wet, more like cake batter than cookie dough.) Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill until firm enough to roll -- at least 2 hours or longer if necessary.
Position two racks in the center of the oven and preheat to 350¬∞F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and place the Confectioners' sugar in a small bowl. Roll the chilled dough into 1¬Ω-inch balls, then roll each ball in confectioners sugar. (If the dough gets sticky, wash your hands and then dust them with confectioners sugar before proceeding.) Arrange 12 balls evenly on each baking sheet, then place remaining dough back in the refrigerator. Bake the cookies for 9 to 12 minutes, rotating the pans from top to bottom and front to back midway through, or until puffy and almost dry between the cracks. Cool the cookies on the pans for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining cookie dough. Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature.",2,1730101212.0,easyrecipes,1,1.0,False

1gdwhl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gdwhl5/im_going_to_be_alone_with_one_of_my_two_roommates/,I'm going to be alone with one of my two roommates and I want to ask them to move out.,"Possible trigger warnings: mention of suicidal ideation, and mental, emotional, and financial abuse.

Backstory: I have two roommates, I'll call them Mega (32 F) and Byte (30 NB) bc I'm a nerd. I've been friends with Mega for two years, she's my best friend and I love her to bits. But platonically, we dated for 3 months when we first met but we've been friends for wayyyyy longer than our relationship and I cherish the friendship.

Mega did ask me before Byte moved in to see if it was ok, and I had a gut feeling I should say no, but Byte was in a supposedly domestic relationship that they had recently left and then ended up rooming with two people who were abusive to each other. So Mega and I thought we were helping someone who desperately needed help. 

Mega was dating someone else at the time, and they ended up ending the relationship and Mega and Byte started dating, but Mega and her ex were still friends. Byte has a lot of mental health issues and was always insecure that Mega was still friends with her ex, and would one day say it was fine they were friends, and then turned around and said they shouldn't be friends and ex just wanted to get back together with her. Mega told Byte straight up before they started dating that if Byte had an issue with Mega being friends with ex, then their relationship would not work out. 

That led to a lot of insecurities and eventually Mega stopped coddling Byte, and that led to a lot of arguments and Byte broke up with Mega after accusing her of having a sordid love affair with ex (when all 4 of us are on Life360 and Mega, Byte, and I all have access to the Ring cameras that are positioned at the doors). Eventually Byte apologized to Mega, and assumed because they apologized, they were back together. Mega doesn't do the back and forth ""we're together, now we're not, now we are"" bs because we aren't teenagers and if someone says the relationship is done, whether it's during a fight or not, those words are going to stick and not be taken back. The breakup stuck, but now Byte picks fights with Mega, repeatedly wakes her up when Mega works late which has led to a lot of sleep deprivation, spends ALL of their money and so far $300 of Mega's money this month because they are sharing a bank account (Mega thought she was helping Byte with finances, but has ended up paying all of Bytes bills and repeatedly bailing the account out of negative balances). Byte doesn't really clean, won't talk to me, and was in the hospital over a kidney stone they've refused to do anything about. They had a laser to break up the stone and a stint put in, and now says they had surgery and has been trying to make us feel sorry for them and do everything for them. 

They're convinced both me and ex are secretly still in love with Mega, I'm using Mega to move out of state (when it's been super clear from the beginning that I was moving in to save up money to move either out of the state or country), and apparently neither Mega or I do anything for Byte even though we've helped them through their crises that they go through almost every day and have helped them when they needed it.

Funny enough, Mega fairly recently had facial surgery to remove cancer from her face, and Byte refused to do anything for her. They said she was milking the surgery, complained that they hadn't been intimate (after FACIAL SURGERY), and has been using Mega's car since they moved in because Byte doesn't have one, but says it's both of theirs because Byte paid for a single oil change and brakes. Because that's how it works. /s

We're already taking care of Byte's animals on top of ours, because they won't feed or water either their dog or cat, or let their dog out. Mega has dogs of her own, and ends up taking care of Bytes, because she doesn't want Byte's animals to suffer. We stopped taking care of the cat for a couple days.. she didn't eat for about 2 days because Byte would not give her food. I ended up giving her food because I felt so bad for her, and she was so hungry. 

They also stopped taking care of their kid, which funny enough also didn't have anything and Mega bought them clothes, a bunk bed with mattresses, all the bedding stuff, and Bytes ex had to tell them to take care of their kid because Byte wouldn't wash him or get him a toothbrush. They regularly ignore the kid, when all he wants is attention from his parent. (His other parent won't do anything either so we haven't really told them anything about what's going on, poor kid is stuck with shitty parents.) 

I went through the shared bank account, and the money that was brought in from Byte vs what they spent alone.... not including rent, utilities, or the stuff Mega bought for them and their kid that she's still paying for, last month Byte had spent all but $120 of their money on mostly Amazon, Target, apple apps, and coffee shops, and this month so far they've spent all of their income plus almost $300 of Mega's. August they spent all but $6 of their money on the same shit, and complained that there wasn't that much money because Mega is paying all of her AND Byte's  bills. 

They stopped going to therapy and taking their meds, lied about both for a while, quit cold turkey off benzos, has hit things with Mega's car (lied about that too for a while) and removed themselves from Life360 so Mega is no longer allowing them access to her car. I've been helping with their kid for the past couple months, but now they've been throwing temper tantrums and said they should have never relied on me when I wasn't able to watch him on my sisters birthday, I am no longer involving myself in anything to do with Byte or their kid.

Mega is going out of town from today until Saturday, and that leaves Byte and I by ourselves. Byte has been majorly going after Mega, calling her a piece of shit, an asshole, and said when Mega was crying and needed to go to the hospital (she had a secondary infection and was delirious, and also HAD FACE CANCER) that Mega was dramatic and only wanted sympathy/to have Byte do stuff for her. Bruh, I did more for Mega after her surgery than her own partner. 

Mega doesn't want to kick them out, because she doesn't want to go back on her word when she told Byte that she'd never kick them out. But I never made that promise, so I want to. 

The problem at hand, I want to tell Byte they have 30 days to find another place. Neither of us are on the lease, and I'm just really hoping Byte doesn't try to retaliate esp using my or Mega's animals. Mega hasn't called the cops on Byte, but Byte keeps threatening to kill themselves and blames it on their mental health issues. We can't call the property management company, because me and Byte are in violation of the lease and that would jeopardize Mega. 

Any tips on how to approach the conversation? Any ideas on what to say and do to help me get through to Byte that they need to leave?

TLDR; one of two roommates is a roommate from hell and has been mentally, emotionally, and financially abusing my friend who is my other roommate. It's created a really awkward and heavy environment. My friend and I want them gone, but not really sure how to go about it. 

Also this is probably rambling and a mess, it's 2 AM and I'm exhausted but can't sleep. Sorry about that. Also I doubt they see this, but I hope they do. üñï them. ",1,1730101075.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Alright, man, I gotta tell you about this crazy experience I had on XLoveCams. You know, it started out as just another night of browsing, no big deal, right? But things took a wild turn ‚Äì like, *actually interesting.* Let me break it down.

# What‚Äôs the Deal with [XLoveCams](https://shorturl.at/rex3N)?

So, XLoveCams is a live cam site, but it‚Äôs not like all the others. Instead of just clicking through random streams, you get to actually chat with the models, and they‚Äôre *real* about it. Not that fake ‚Äútip and smile‚Äù routine ‚Äì I‚Äôm talking real convos. It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre right there with you.

# The ‚ÄúOne‚Äù That Stood Out

So, here‚Äôs where it gets spicy. I‚Äôm just cruising through the profiles, right? 

And then ‚Äì bam! ‚Äì there‚Äôs this one woman who completely caught me off guard. Not only is she ridiculously gorgeous, but she actually seemed interested in chatting beyond the usual stuff. 

I wasn‚Äôt just another name on her screen. We‚Äôre talking personal vibes, like she‚Äôs actually into the back-and-forth and the whole energy of the conversation.

I was thinking, ‚ÄúYeah, this is gonna be the usual 5-minute chit-chat.‚Äù But nope ‚Äì we start talking movies, favorite bands, and suddenly it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm having a beer with her.

[Bro if you want to try it out click here...](https://shorturl.at/rex3N)

 She‚Äôs got this vibe that just‚Ä¶ *pulls you in,* man. It was intense. And the craziest part? I half-jokingly mentioned maybe meeting up, thinking she‚Äôd laugh it off ‚Äì but, bro, she‚Äôs actually down! 

Said she‚Äôs planning a trip near my city in a few months. We‚Äôve been talking about meeting for coffee, and she seems genuinely interested.

Look, I‚Äôve been on other sites before, but XLoveCams feels different. It‚Äôs not just about the video; it‚Äôs like they make it *easy* to actually connect. And some of these women? They‚Äôre not just sitting there waiting for tips ‚Äì they‚Äôre there to connect, have a good time, and, yeah, maybe meet up.

**Real Interaction** ‚Äì The models are seriously engaging. It‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúthanks for the tip‚Äù situation. They talk, they remember stuff about you, and it‚Äôs almost like you‚Äôre building something real. **Private Sessions and Customization** ‚Äì You can set up private shows, customize things, make it feel *tailored.* The whole experience just feels‚Ä¶ personal, you know? **Safe and Private** ‚Äì Security‚Äôs tight, and payments are secure, so I don‚Äôt worry about anything shady. It‚Äôs discreet, which is clutch.

# 

Not every connection‚Äôs gonna be fire. Some interactions don‚Äôt have the same spark, and yeah, those private sessions can get pricey if you‚Äôre not careful. But when you find someone who clicks, it‚Äôs *so* worth it.

If you‚Äôre looking for something a little more‚Ä¶ *real,* I‚Äôm telling you, XLoveCams might surprise you. It‚Äôs not every day you jump on a cam site and end up talking about meeting up for coffee with someone who actually seems into it. I‚Äôm just sayin‚Äô ‚Äì give it a shot, and who knows?

Let‚Äôs call her Ray. First I met her in college when she was fundraising for a church event, she was asking me to donate money. I did. Later we could run into each other quite often. One day I just invite her to a gig where I would perform, she agrees to come, I ask for her number to send her the details. Later when I send her the details she mentions that she won‚Äôt be able to come as there‚Äôs another event she has to go to the same day. I‚Äôm like okay. I couple days later we casually text she asks me to take her to dinner. I agree. Next day we go and the waitress already knows her name and randomly comes in at one point to ask if we were on a date. Ray says yes it would be weird if we weren‚Äôt. Till that point I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was actually a date or a casual hangout. We seem to get along quite well and she suggests that next week we watch a movie together. I agree. Next week she comes over to my place. We watch the movie and eventually she makes the first move and kisses me. I couldn‚Äôt make the first move as I hadn‚Äôt had much if any experience in dating. Plus I had also grown up traumatized and isolated, so it took time for me to be comfortable around others, especially when it came if intimacy. However, while making out she says she won‚Äôt sleep with me and it takes her time. I‚Äôm like okay it‚Äôs the same for me. Next day she suggests that we make it a routine to watch a movie every week. I agree. She comes over second and third time, each time she says she won‚Äôt sleep with me. I‚Äôm like okay I like it this way, wherein she says that she used to be a whore but now she‚Äôs not. That bothers me a bit. She comes over forth time, where we go a bit further than just making out, like fingering stuff, she gets naked and all that. But she says she‚Äôs still not going to sleep with me. I‚Äôm like okay fine. Later while talking she casually quips that she loves cock. That also bothered me a bit but I don‚Äôt say anything. I was bothered that she let other men sleep with her so quick but not me. 
Next week I‚Äôm under a lot of stress as there are chances that I‚Äôd be kicked out from my university. I meet the director, he‚Äôs adamant in kicking me out. After the meeting I run into Ray, while talking to her, she mentions that she‚Äôs gonna come over to my place tommrow, after which I tell her that some girl in class this morning wrote her number on a piece of paper and gave it to me. She has a bad reaction but acts normal. A couple hours later she says she cannot come to my place as she has homework to do. I suggest that we could do the homework together at a library if she likes. She agrees. Next day we go to the library where she has forgotten her laptop charger, I allow her to work on my laptop as I didn‚Äôt need it at that moment. An hour or two later I tell her that I need my laptop for a bit. She says she‚Äôs not done yet. Then she suggests that we go to her apartment, get her charger and then go to my place and do the homework there. I agree. On the way to her apartment she changes her mind and says she‚Äôll work at her apartment, I reply that she can work at mine if she wants. She doesn‚Äôt say anything and leaves. 

A couple days later I run into her in college where I‚Äôm pretty sure something‚Äôs off. Like two weeks later she asks to meet for coffee, I agree. There she mentions that she has a chastity pledge now and since I wasn‚Äôt a Christian she can‚Äôt marry me. She mentions that after the forth visit she had decided to have sex with me but changed her mind last minute, also she says that the forgotten laptop charger was a sign from god not to have sex with me.  She also tells me that I was the first man to treat her like a proper woman, and treated her good. And that she knows now that it is possible to have a meaningful connection. She also mentions how whenever she would go to someone‚Äôs place, she would think she‚Äôs not going to have sex with him but would have sex anyway when she did. This bothered me very much, as why didn‚Äôt that happen with me and it did with the other men. Why was I left with nothing having treated her good but the other men got everything they wanted without treating her right. Why was I made to wait for sex but not any of the other men she dated before me. I did call her chsiaty pledge story bullshit, I definitely thought it had something to do with that story about the girl writing her number on a price of paper and giving it to me. 

I‚Äôve been racking my brain for all this time as to what I did wrong but no answers. Nor any answers from her, as I‚Äôve literally begged just to tell me what happened, what did I do wrong. It‚Äôs like a survival mechanism, this rumination. As to not let this thing happen again, to learn from my mistakes, so that if I‚Äôm in a similar situation, I could do better. My therapist mentions that I would play games and was inauthentic from the start. That maybe true, but I‚Äôm still not convinced. Until I don‚Äôt have the answer, it‚Äôs scary to date anyone else, as I don‚Äôt want the same thing to happens again. 

Anyways, like 3-4 months later I run into her in college. Where I express my anger, tell her that what she did was wrong and she led me on. We have a huge argument. She gets angry, being angry she does mention that there was a real reason why she left. Meaning that chastity pledge thing was bullshit. She mentioned that she didn‚Äôt want to see me anymore, but doesn‚Äôt mention the reason why. I‚Äôm still in the dark. ",1,1730100086.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

I‚Äôm around 3 months now (I tried carni in the spring, but failed due to cheating). 
Here some results (for the moment):
1. All the things you guys already mentioned, like good sleep, no bloating, good energy etc. 
2. Some metrics (sorry for another system, I‚Äôm from Kazakhstan): 
- I lost 5 kilograms overall
-- I lost 3 kilos from visceral fat, according to some ‚Äúsmart‚Äù scales 
- I gained 1 kilos of muscles 
- I went down 2 sizes (from W30 to W28).

What‚Äôs the plan: stick to it. I‚Äôm still testing my skin issues, like skin tag on my neck. Dr Berry said that it will fall off eventually. For me, that would be top result for me. 

What I eat: 
eggs (3-5 daily), 
beef (I don‚Äôt measure, just to full): most of the time it‚Äôs boiled with bones (to drink with broth) and some time it‚Äôs minced beef cooked, horse meat (I think 1-2 times a week), lamb (occasionally), salmon (1-2 times a week), and sometimes chicken,
Local butter,
Sometimes local cottage cheese and cream (I don‚Äôt know whether u have this in your locations, it‚Äôs about 60% fat) 

I drink tea (and also with milk), I drink coffee (black and with butter or milk) almost every day 

I‚Äôm not training regularly, but I do some pushups, pull-ups and squats, like when I see bar, or just as morning routine. ",1,1730099659.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt ask him again until Sunday and he‚Äôs like i‚Äôm not sure what to do so i went in and entered all of his info for him even though i came to a coffee shop to do the essay i had due.

Me: Are you not willing to call 609-584-4480 extension 1421 and ask for help? 

Dad: no I am not. You are grown. This why you should keep contact with your mother. 

Me: ok. I will find another cosigner. 

I forgot that dad doesn‚Äôt like to ask for help and relinquish control for a second because he‚Äôs a raging narcissist. 

I feel really bad though because i waited all week for you just for you to tell me you can't do it at the very last step. A lot of my energy was wasted. Today instead of doing the essay i needed to do i put in all your information for you and then you can't help me with the last step. It is not up to me to give consent to check your credit if I am an adult or not i still cannot give them consent to check someone else's credit. It really saddens me that you had me waste all of this energy.

Me: i‚Äôm not sure what you mean

My current roommate (M 21, lets call him S) and I (F 21) became friends during our freshman year of college. We had a mutual group of friends that year who we would hang out with fairly frequently. I never considered myself very close with him, but it was always nice to see him and talk to him. During the two years I attended, I learned more about his personality. We shared a few interests, and bonded over our shared classes and freshman experiences. He also seemed a bit standoffish and rude at times, would put his friends last constantly, and asked for favors that he never repaid. His room was extremely messy and had rotting food that made his closer friends confront him to no avail. He spent most of his time in his room talking to his internet friend groups at this point, but later I found out that most of these groups kicked him out for a plethora of different reasons.  Most of the friends in our group stopped talking to him because of these things and kind of moved on to other friends to hang out with. When he came to me about this, I felt bad for him and continued speaking to him despite the red flags raised by these behaviors. I didn't want to lose my first friend at college so easily.

In our second year, we shared a dorm floor with separate rooms. We had more roommates this time, and we all made efforts to hang out together. I mostly hung out with my newer friends that year, but would still try to make time for S. He would ask for rides to places around town, which i had no problem doing. The issue was that we would arrive to the store or location and he would never have the money he needed to pay. So out of pity, either me or the friends that accompanied us would pay for his shopping cart or tab. He would guilt trip people for doing things without him, and would constantly make fun of friends that did not share his opinions as a 'joke'.

At first, I didn't think anything of it, but after speaking to one of our last mutual friends, I learned that he had only been speaking to her in order to get rides or favors from her. She felt like she was being used and that their relationship no longer felt like a friendship at all. She also mentioned how uncomfortable S made her feel when he would bring up her being neurodivergent. He would treat it as the punchline of a joke, saying that her making a mistake was because she had this condition, or her decor choices were because she was neurodivergent, etcetera. He would justify this by claiming he was also neurodivergent, but when I asked him about it he told me he was never diagnosed and just 'thought he was'. Our mutual friend asked him to stop, and despite claiming he would, he continued to make jokes at her expense. After she distanced herself, S posted vague complaints about her online, which made her even more uncomfortable.

 Me and the other roommates constantly had issues with food going missing from our shared kitchen. After checking the cameras, it turned out that it was S taking the food. When I confronted him about it, he said from now on he would ask. A day later, I notice there are ramen noodles in the brewing compartment of my very expensive coffee maker. WTF??? Again, I tell him to ask before using things or to at least clean up when he's done. He agrees. And then continues to make ramen noodles in my coffee maker for the remainder of the year. 

I switched colleges during my junior year and chose not to message S. He never messaged me outside of the occasional ask to vent or ask me to get something for him from my hometown. I came back to the college that friend was from after that year. We were assigned the same room within a two-room dorm (4 people total) through his request. At this point, he had never shared a room with someone before, and i was worried about how he would act. S is definitely someone that values their alone time, and I knew that not having enough made him irritable. At the college we attend, we are asked to have roommate meetings and eventually signed roommate agreements stating the terms of how we would like to keep our space. While texting about this, he mentioned that he was neurodivergent and did not want the room to have light in it. I told him that I would bring a smaller lamp so that his side of the room would stay dark and I would still be able to see. He said this was fine. I also mentioned that I like to keep my space tidy and that while I don't mind a messy room, I do not want any food or really nasty messes to be left because I don't want bugs in our room. Again, he said he would keep his space tidy.

When we moved in, these promises were almost immediately broken. His side of the room is constantly dirty, messy, and has open containers of food and old trash everywhere. He wants my lamp turned off every night around 11, and if i don't do it by then, he makes backhanded remarks about it until i do. He has a growing tendency to cuss at me and  insult me about my interests or making silly mistakes. It really hurts my feelings, especially since I trusted him with information I would not tell other people. It feels like he is bullying me, even though he says it's just his sense of humor. Whenever I say something about it, he apologizes, stops for a week, and then continues making fun of me. He is still using mine and my roommates things without asking. Last weekend, we went out clubbing and he ran off without telling anyone multiple times after our very clear requests to stick together. I understood that he was overstimulated because he went nonverbal. I understood that the environment was overwhelming so I let it go. We went out to eat afterwards, and after I bought everyone dinner, he buys himself something and refuses to share. We get back to the dorm, and he announces he wants everyone to leave him alone and that he wants the room to himself. Again, I totally understand that he wants to decompress. The last straw was this afternoon after I cooked a nice home made meal for myself. He walks in and immediately says that the room smells like death. My feelings were hurt, so I just didn't respond. He continues about how terrible it smells, and how bad his day was, and how he wanted me to turn the lights off. I did, and asked if he was going to bed, and he completely ignores me until i start heading for the living room. I ask if he heard me and he says he didn't. I hear him giggle as i close the door. 

  
It's a tiny thing but it's definitely a situation of the last straw breaking the camel's back. I dread coming back to the room even when S isn't there and don't even feel comfortable sleeping there. I often sleep on the couch so I don't do something embarrassing in my sleep for S to talk about later. As much as I want to be kind and accommodating to S, the constant negativity is really getting to me. I've done my best to be cordial and polite given the circumstances and I try not to take the things he says to heart. I feel like he has driven a lot of friends away because of his comments, and when he asks me why I think that has happened it's hard to be honest with him without also incriminating myself. His jokes strike deep and are extremely harsh.  I don't want to be disrespectful if he is neurodivergent. I know neurodivergent people can have a hard time with social cues, and I feel like I have been pretty easygoing with S about this. I do feel like the many requests from our friends and I should have been a stopping point for the mean comments.  There are good times with him, but the bad times are definitely outweighing them. I want to move rooms, but I don't want to lose my friendship with the other roommates I have. My friends outside of college tell me I should move asap. What I honestly want to do is move out without any notice to S. I know this is the cowardly way to go about it, but facing him won't change how he acts.

Am I being too sensitive? A coward? I want to be better if I can be. Let me know.

Heck, we were basically doing this all the time even while I was working fulltime for the prior three years between 2019 and 2022.

The one thing I'm struggling a bit with right is regretting not taking more photos, video and audio of him but I think literally everyone feels the same way with the death of a loved one. Also, I recorded a video of us exchanging ""I love you""'s about a week before he died, when I realized for sure he didn't have much time left, on top of some audio I recorded of him before he lost responsiveness, and these I'm really glad I took. 

Sorry if this seems like a ramble but I needed to let it all out somehow. Basically I spent the last five years doing nothing special at all and giving him care and driving out/eating out with him and generally making sure he was happy while I worked on existing mental health issues of my own. 

I lived in the moment and didn't care as much as I wish I had about taking pics and video of us because 1) we were both camera shy and admitted to each other we never liked the way we looked in pictures  2) I always felt like pulling out a camera to capture a memory, for when after the inevitable would occur later on, kind of killed the mood in the moment, so I just enjoyed my meals in peace with him and 3) the things we were doing to enjoy ourselves were so mundane and boring (like ordering the same meal again and again, getting Dunkin coffee night after night and then driving home to watch the news or Forensic Files or Dateline) that no one night ever warranted taking pictures or mementos.

I think I covered all my feelings pretty well here. I'm gonna devote this entire week and the next digging up any and all mementos from old phones, cameras and camcorders to see what else I can find, but for now the regret is eating at me a little less now. My dad was such a good natured man, the thing that scares me the most about his passing is that it'll be so hard to surround myself with people as gentle and kind as he was.",5,1730098027.0,GriefSupport,2,0.86,False

I enjoy the run what you brung mentality. I could just throw slicks on and be there but I don't want to do that.  
  
I am going to be switching to a sticker drag radial as this year I really had to heat up my tires to get my best time.

Does anyone have suggestions for me? my buddies just tell me get skinnies but it doesnt quite match what I want for the car in terms of drive ability when I am not at the 1/4 mile which is only one or twice a year.

1gdvmg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1gdvmg8/one_time_i_read_someones_dream_as_in_i_was/,"one time I read someones dream. As in, I was reading a book in the tent next to them and they dreamed what I was reading.","This was one of those moments in my life where I cannot explain it nor can I discount it. 

It started about a week before the actual event. As I was sitting on my porch listening to my roomates friend talk about how he never has any dream that isn't just perfectly normal. He never once had any fantastical dreams. Fast forward about a week and we had all gone camping. We had taken a tent up past a washout in the road and were camping in an actual campsite that was not accessible  by car anymore because of a slide that took out the road. So we were able to camp in a site that was right next to the river and there were no other people around, it was a very nice location. Well of course the sun had come up early and woke us all up but we had stayed up late and wanted to get some more sleep, so after making a fire to boil some water for coffee we decided to get back into our sleeping and sleep for a few more hours. 

I had brought a book I was reading and as I couldn't fall right back to sleep I decided to read for a little bit. The book I was reading was called The Dragon and the Unicorn. I had been given this book to read and I just wasn't into it. Until that moment, I remember even looking at the page number because I was suddenly struck by a sense of overwhelming joy and oneness.. I don't know how to describe it but I had finally realized that this was a story about Merlyn's back story and king Arthur. I was on page 212 and it was describing how Merlyn was created. It talked about how Merlin was a product of the devil raping a nun that was on a far away planet that the devil had been searching and searching through the cosmos for this nun. (this all happened about 15 years ago so I am not totally clear on the exact story line. I was a voracious reader and was gobbling up books at the time so if I am getting some of that wrong, I apologize, but it shouldn't ruin the point.) Anyways, I remember this feeling came over me when I realized what this story was about. up until then I didn't know that it was about arthur and Merlyn. I believe they were using the name Myrdin in the book and at the time I was unfamiliar with that name. I digress, but after this profound sense of joy and all I can say, closeness and oneness. I marked my page and drifted off to sleep. 

We woke up a few hours later and I was gathering fire wood to start a fire to cook us breakfast. As I was doing so I heard my roomates friend talking and he was remarking on his dream that he had while we had gone back to sleep. He found it remarkable because he had never had a fantastical dream, well in his dream he was riding on a dragon looking for a lady, I wasn't really paying attention to him as I was gathering wood but this caught my attention. Because I was still thinking about this feeling of rapturous joy that I had experienced. At the time I remember attributing it to the fact that I had just put it together that this book was about king Arthur and Merlin, but looking back I think it was because of something else. Anyways, I stopped and walked over to him and said, please continue telling us what your dream was. He went on to account verbatim what I was reading when I had this feeling and while he was sleeping in the tent next to mine.  He was shook by this dream, he couldn't believe that he had finally had a fantastical dream.  But he said he was so disturbed by it that he wanted to talk about it. The raping of the young nun was of course a disturbing conclusion to his dream. 

I was so incredibly taken by this that I had gotten my book out of my tent and after his accounting of the dream, I took out the book and flipped to page 212 and started reading. My roomate and his friend were both stunned. He was shaking and couldn't believe that somehow what I was reading at the exact time he was having his dream were one and the same. To this day I wonder how this could have happened.. But I think that feeling I had wasn't so much the realization of what the story was about but was a connection to some sort of world consciousness that I briefly touched. There was no way this guy had ever heard about the book I was reading, nor did he have access to the book at any time. He was not a reader and never had any interest in reading for anything outside of school.. 

  
I don't have any explanation for this event I was just glad that my roomate was there to listen to his dream and then listen to the chapter of that book as I read it back to them. This was such a profound moment of my life that I think about it regularly. The feeling I had more so than the fact I was reading his dream. And before you ask, no, I was not reading out loud. No he had no way of getting the book from me while I slept, I am a light sleeper and I fell asleep with the book in my hands and woke up that way. It was all such a strange event. I am curious if anyone else has ever had something like this happen?

TW: addiction, alcohol, drugs, mention of heroin 

My dad died a few days ago. I have never ever had a good relationship with him. I‚Äôve been estranged from him for about a decade, and from my mom about half that time. 

To give a tl;dr of where I‚Äôm coming from, my parents met in AA. My dad actually was still married to my sister‚Äôs mom when he started seeing my mom. I truly don‚Äôt know the timeline of their separation, her getting pregnant with me, but my parents married when my mom was seven months pregnant. Their divorce finalized on their second wedding anniversary. 

I have no memory of them being together and my dad was actually a pretty absent and lackadaisical figure in my life throughout my childhood. I lived with my mom full time and my dad had me for pretty regular visitation. But I never feel like he and I connected or that he necessarily cared to. As I got older visitations were spent being babysat by my step sister while my dad went out with his wife. I kind of always have just felt like an obligation to him, not someone he wants to love and understand. 

Throughout my childhood my mom fell into the depths of heroin addiction for her own reasons, and there was a brief weekend my dad tried to take custody of me from my mom on his wife‚Äôs urging. I begged to go back home to my mom, despite what an unsafe environment it was, because she was my mom. 

I would continue to live with her until she went to jail when I was fifteen. When that happened, my dad and I both had no other option - he had to take me in and make a home for me. I will credit him with doing the bare minimum to keep me alive during the two years I lived with him, but it‚Äôs also the time of his life where I theorize his alcoholism was at its worst. 

He was drunk every single night, sometimes passing out in his room naked, with no door. Sometimes I would wake up to broken glass on my kitchen floor because my dad forgot his keys and so he broke our front door window to get in. This happened multiple times. We were more roommates than father-daughter and even that relationship was tenuous. 

Halfway into my senior year of high school he surprised me us getting evicted, and so I finished out school living with a friends family. I then moved in with my sister, then to my aunt, until I finally returned to my mom with claims of her being more stable. 

In my early twenties my dad and I were distant. I visited him occasionally for a coffee or saw him alongside my sister. 
Around age 21ish my dad sent me an aggressive and inappropriate message about my mom. It was clear he wrote it under the influence, but it was hateful, hurtful, and confusing to receive from my dad (on Facebook no less). This message haunts me for the rest of my life. I can‚Äôt find it anymore and I can‚Äôt really remember the words but the sentiment truly cut me and remain with me forever after. 

We tried to reconcile after my nephew was born, but I always held him at arms length. When my niece was born, there were some difficult times with him and this led me to go fully no contact. My sister took a step back at the time as well but ended up reestablishing contact, making amends, and he had a second life as a very good grandfather supposedly. He and I shared only a few messages after this, and the last time we spoke was 2016. He was supporting Trump and successfully denied everything I remembered about my teen years and early twenties with him rather than taking accountability, so I wrote him off. 

Flash forward to this last Friday. My husband (best friends with my sister) came to me as I woke up with some news and explained my father was being taken off of life support. This was the first news of hearing that he was ill and it was all quite shocking. Only a few hours later he passed away. 

I don‚Äôt regret the way my relationship went with my father - I truly believe we never had a chance to understand each other. I‚Äôm hard to press to pull up good memories, and the ones I can are from my very early childhood. Everything through my adolescence and teens is mostly painful, sometimes neutral, always complicated. However, I‚Äôve been grieving a lot of what I didn‚Äôt have. I wish I had a proper father, but I don‚Äôt feel the loss of this man‚Äôs death. But the thought kept coming to me, if this was my mom‚Ä¶ would I feel the same?

I found out today the day after he passed away, my mom reached out to my sister via text. (Again, not my sister‚Äôs mom) My mom and I have been NC about five years, since I got engaged. Her message was thoughtful but also carried a few of her constant tropes - ‚ÄúI know you all think I‚Äôm bad but I‚Äôve worked hard to a better person and I‚Äôve been sober for over a decade.‚Äù This always gives me pause because tbh I‚Äôm never accusing my mother of not being sober; our problems always have more deeply in her emotional immaturity. Which we also see in the heavy ‚ÄúI know you all think I‚Äôm bad but‚Äù vs her never taking accountability for any of the hurt she‚Äôs caused me or my sister. 

That being said, there‚Äôs a lot in me right now, not even a week after my dad dying, that wants to throw caution to the wind about my mom and try to reconnect. I have stood firm with remaining NC since making that boundary in 2019, I have discussed it heavily in therapy for a number of years and always concluded that our boundaries are for the best, but this grief has softened my heart and made me afraid. For the first time in my life I feel I could regret my mom passing without trying to give her another chance. 

I‚Äôm trying to remind myself that this is just me being naive, but it‚Äôs very hard to navigate and I thought it could be helpful to hear the perspective of folks who have been in a similar position. I hope I‚Äôve explained things well and I appreciate any insight. This is a new thing to navigate for myself. If you read this I also thank you a lot for taking the time to lend me an ear.

1gdvial,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1gdvial/myoinositol_bad_side_effects/,Myo-Inositol bad side effects?,"**TL;DR:** After two weeks of taking inositol, it caused stress, dizziness, and a sense of panic for me.

**In detail:**

I've started taking inositol for my insulin resistance, initially using half the recommended dose from my doctor to ease into it. I'm not taking any other medications; the plan was to tackle IR with lifestyle changes and inositol, as advised by my doctor. I don't have PCOS, but I know that unfortunately a lot of you have IR also... that is why I am asking you.

I took it for two weeks without any noticeable positive effects, though I may have had fewer cravings. However, several unusual symptoms began to appear, which seemed to coincide with when I started inositol. I took 2g of inositol on an empty stomach each morning, followed by folate, and about 15 minutes later my usual breakfast + coffee. I planned to increase the dose to 2g in the evening also, as my doctor recommended daily 2x2gramms.

Initially, I started feeling dizzy. It happened constantly‚Äîwhether I was standing, lying down, or even driving, so I avoided driving during that time.

Then, I experienced random panic-like feelings. I‚Äôve had mild panic attacks in the past but they were rare and usually triggered by mental overload. (I think have it ""naturally"" because my mom has it also, and grandma) This time, it struck without reason‚Äîelevated heart rate, chest tingling, dizziness. The feeling would pass after half an hour, but I was left with brain fog and a lingering dizziness, like I was drunk or stoned.

After about five days, I took my usual morning dose, had breakfast and coffee, and went about my work calmly. Then, suddenly, I almost fainted. My heart rate spiked from 51 to 117 (according to my watch). It felt like everything went dark for a moment, and I was again hit with dizziness, anxiety, and tears. It took another half hour before I felt better.

On top of that, just as my cycle was finally regular after 1.5 years post-birth control (with the last three cycles being 28-33 days), I'm now on day 41 with no sign of my period. It seems to have disrupted my newly stable cycle and brought back hormonal acne that I‚Äôd almost cleared up.

At first, I thought it might be due to work stress, but my partner and family pointed out that I started feeling worse precisely when I began taking inositol. Could this supplement be causing these issues?

I immediately stopped taking it, and it's been a week since. I feel much better now. The dizziness is gone, I'm calmer, haven‚Äôt had any further issues, my mind is clearer, and my mood has improved again.

I‚Äôm still looking for a concrete biological explanation, and found on some other old posts that some also experience something like this, but I am shocked.

I‚Äôve also considered restarting it and monitoring my blood sugar, as I read that these panic-like, dizzy feelings could stem from hypoglycemia (possibly due to inositol‚Äôs impact on blood sugar via insulin). Since I‚Äôm already looking for a good dietitian or diabetologist to help manage my IR, I‚Äôll ask them for advice, but I‚Äôd love to hear if anyone else has had similar reactions or any other negative (or positive) experiences with inositol.",1,1730096461.0,PCOS,1,1.0,False

1gdvgvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1gdvgvy/feeling_cornered_unemployed_and_having_trouble/,Feeling cornered unemployed and having trouble balancing getting back on my feet with maintained relationship‚Äîstruggling with whether to break up,"I‚Äôve been in a long-distance relationship for 3 years, and I‚Äôm starting to feel completely cornered. I lost my job and moved back in with my parents a year ago, so the expectation has fallen on me to travel to see my girlfriend. She‚Äôs in grad school and can‚Äôt travel, but I‚Äôve been out to see her five times this past year, each time for weeks at a stretch. Mainly because she struggles with the distance, so I feel a lot of pressure from her to always be planning the ‚Äònext trip.‚Äô It‚Äôs understandable to want to know when we‚Äôll see each other next, but the cadence is wearing me down‚Äîboth financially and in terms of me being able to get my life together.

I love her, and when we‚Äôre together things are great, but the burden is starting to feel unbearable. I‚Äôve sacrificed so much‚Äîmy time, my goals, my priorities‚Äîto keep the flexibility needed to see her, and my life is starting to feel all sorts of messed up. I know I‚Äôve been flexible because I don‚Äôt have a job right now, but I can‚Äôt keep this up. I can‚Äôt even do gig work or focus on my future because I‚Äôm always going back and forth. It‚Äôs impossible to get hired when I know I‚Äôll be leaving again in 5-6 weeks. The only real option is a remote job, but a.) I‚Äôve been applying and no one is hiring, and b.) I don‚Äôt want to take just any job just because it allows me to visit her.

I‚Äôm at the point where I need to focus on my future. Getting momentum in a career is critical. Yes, it can happen anytime, but why should I keep putting it on hold? I don‚Äôt feel comfortable deprioritizing my own success. It keeps me up at night that I can‚Äôt even get a job at a coffee shop right now. I have no income, and I‚Äôm spending $500 on flights every 6 weeks. And honestly, sometimes I feel like my effort isn‚Äôt even fully appreciated. This cadence we‚Äôre in feels expected, and she takes it personally if I tell her I can‚Äôt come because I have my own priorities.

I can‚Äôt tell if this is all because I‚Äôm bad at setting boundaries or if it‚Äôs the relationship itself that‚Äôs the problem. I feel like I want to leave because of how one-sided it feels, but I keep kicking the can down the road. I know I need to make a change, but I don‚Äôt know what that is. I love her, but I can‚Äôt keep doing this. How do I figure out if this is just a boundaries issue, or is it time to end things?
