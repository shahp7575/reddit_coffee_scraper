Somewhere else?","We currently live in San Antonio area and need to escape the heat. I'm originally from LA area, but have lived in Norcal (Humboldt), Seattle, Alaska, & Maine. My fiance has lived mostly in the south, but she also lived in New Zealand for 10 years before coming back to the states.

I earn 200k full remote and my fiance is back in school and not making much right now, but she will probably pull in ~60k or so after she graduates and goes back to full time.

We have no kids and no plans to, just a couple dogs. I love the coast and the seafood and lifestyle that comes with it, and really want to be within a couple hours max of the coast. Ideally, I think we want a mid-sized city, but open to smaller towns and larger cities as well. Bike friendly, close to nature, mostly liberal politics, lots of craft breweries, a decent amount of things to do, etc., is our jam. If we can live in a walkable neighborhood but also have a house and a yard, that would seriously be the dream. At least walkable to a local watering hole, coffee shop, etc. An absolute must needs to be mostly mild summers. I don't mind the heat as much, but my fiance hates it.

West coast move to PNW would make sense, I've lived there before and can handle the cold and rain. Seattle area, Portland, Bellingham are where we've been considering the most so far. However, besides my short stint in Maine, I don’t have a whole lot of east coast experience. Are there any gems out there we should be considering? Any other west coast options we should look at? Open to anything, going to travel a bit this year and explore, and hopefully sell the house and move next year.",1,1736988436.0,SameGrassButGreener,0,0.67,False

1i2clih,https://i.redd.it/xf678bdv59de1.jpeg,Spirit keeping ,"Have you heard the term #spiritkeeping before? Many consider it trivial as “genie parenting”. However, The Art of Spirit Keeping is a profound science. Every #spirit has its own unique role in the human world.
we have two main components: Man and Spirit. We, as Keepers, are bound with Spirit through the bind process, through the Vessel, the personal spirit portal.
Vessel is the spiritual house that the conjurer created for the spirit. It’s not just a place, it’s also an energy tower. With the right materials and energy, spirit can manifest realistically, from touch to aroma.
Spirit wants to help because of karma and reciprocal relationships. They are not maids, but best friends.
Therefore, a strong relationship between the Keeper and Spirit is important. The stronger, the more effective the spirit performs.
Like a friend, the more we pay attention to him, the better he is to us. That’s why offering for spirit, or sajen, is very important in bonding. Each spirit has its own offering negotiation.
And obviously, spirits are not to be worshipped. The condition is similar to a security guard. You are guarded, given coffee and salary, but you do not worship the security guard, right?

Roger opened his eyes groggily. He stared at the ceiling for a moment before smiling. It was the weekend; finally, he had the day off. He got up in his pajamas and slipped on his slippers to make himself a cup of coffee. After brewing it, he couldn't think of anywhere better than his porch to enjoy the crisp spring morning air.

It was a beautiful day outside—the air was fresh, the birds were singing, and the sun was just peeking over the horizon with not a cloud in sight. He sat down and took a deep breath. Then another. And another. Something was... wrong. What was that pungent smell?

He set his coffee mug on the nearby table and got up to investigate. Walking off the porch, he headed toward his new pool. It was a bit extravagant, he knew, but after getting a promotion at work, he'd decided to treat himself. Last summer, he built the pool. But when he looked down at the water, it wasn't the beautiful, clean pool he'd known.

No. It was... yellow? How could it be? The smell was so bad it was almost unbearable! Someone—or multiple people, hundreds, even—must have done this. But who? Who had he wronged so badly that they would orchestrate this? He had to find out who had ruined his beautiful pool.

Frustrated, he sighed and went back inside with his coffee, away from the horrible smell. He sat at the small kitchen table with some fried eggs and bacon, thinking about people he might have wronged. Tammy from the third grade? Evan, his coworker, whose desk he'd accidentally spilled coffee on? Or Cindy, who he had to assign extra work to, leading to her termination? No, it couldn't be them. Only one person came to mind.

He picked up the phone and asked the operator to route him. The phone rang for a while before a female voice came through.

""Hello? Who is this? And why are you calling me so early?"" the irritated voice on the other end asked.

""It's me,"" Roger said. Silence followed. For a moment, he thought the line had been disconnected.

""What do you want, Roger? You got the house, the money, and the new car. What do you want now? The kids?""

""Maybe I will after the bullshit you pulled!""

""What are you talking about now?""

""You know what you did!""

""No, I do NOT.""

""Then who got at least 100 guys to piss in my pool, huh?!""

""What? You called about, WHAT!?""

""Come on, Jane! You're the only one with that many friends and the gall to do it!""

""No, I did not, Roger. Leave me alone.""

The line went dead. Roger slammed the receiver back onto the cradle. His only lead was gone. He had no other ideas—except one. He picked up the phone again and called his friend, Franklin.

He left the house and got into his car. He was headed to a friend's place on the other side of town. He sat down in his brand-new Dodge Royal and started the car. It started right up. He quickly put it in gear and pulled away. On the way, he tried his best to recollect the last couple of days.

When he arrived, his old friend Franklin was sitting in the yard in a lawn chair. He was sipping a beer, enjoying his recent retirement from the force. Once a great investigator, Frank had decided to retire early after a recent case almost ended badly for him. Roger pulled up into the driveway of Frank's new home, which he had bought shortly after his early retirement.

""Hey, Frank!"" Roger greeted his old friend warmly.

""Hey, Roger! What do you think of the new house?""

""It's nice, Frank,"" said Roger. It was a very nice house, but Roger wasn't really paying attention. His mind was occupied with other things.

""Want a beer?""

""Sure.""

Frank got up and came back with another lawn chair and a couple of beers.

""So, Roger, you said you needed some advice about something you wanted to talk about in person.""

""Yes. Uh, well, I don't know how to say this, but someone—well, not just one, but multiple... Hundreds of people—have peed in my pool.""

Frank looked at Roger in amazement and disbelief for a moment.

""So, you're telling me that hundreds of people broke into your backyard... to pee in your pool?""

""I know it's ridiculous, but... Come on, let me just show you.""

Roger got up, and Frank followed him as they both got into the car and drove to Roger's house. Roger mechanically unlocked the door, stepped out onto the porch, and walked down to the pool. Frank just looked at the yellow pool in disbelief.

Frank began stumbling over his words: ""Wh—Ho—, Who. What, How, Who, When, And most importantly... WHY?""

Roger just looked at him, shaking his head. ""I don't know... Will you help me, Frank?""

Frank nodded his head. ""Especially for a friend, of course.""

Frank decided to activate his investigator mode. ""So, what were you doing the night before you came home and woke up to... this?""

""Well,"" Roger started, ""I went out to the new tiki bar that opened by the beach. I met a nice girl named Janet. We sat at the bar and talked for hours. It was really nice. It was a beautiful night.""

Frank interjected, ""Was she with anyone else?""

""Not that I know of.""

""Okay, continue.""

""Around midnight, I left the bar. I walked, not too far from home, so I didn't drive there. Then I got inside the house and collapsed on the bed. I was hammered.""

Frank nodded, thinking through what Roger had just told him. ""Okay. This morning, when you walked down your porch, did you investigate any further?""

Roger looked embarrassed for a moment, then said, ""No, I immediately went inside. I thought it had to be Jane.""

Frank looked at him, then said, ""Roger, there is no possible way she did this.""

Roger nodded his head. ""Okay, let's start the investigation.""

They looked around the yard for the next half hour. They found no evidence of a break-in. Nothing in the garden shed. They found one beer can: Marty Waterhouse Lite Beer. Roger and Frank sat defeated inside, looking at the single empty beer can, before Roger came up with the single craziest idea he had ever thought of.

""The Waterhouse Brewery headquarters is in town,"" Roger said.

Frank nodded along, encouraging Roger to continue.

""What if we get the serial number off this beer can, trace it to who bought it, and track down who did this?""

Frank looked at him for a moment, the gears in his head turning. ""Yes, it's a long shot, but it's possible. I have some contacts at headquarters who owe me favors. Let's go!""

Frank quickly got up and dragged Roger out the door. Frank decided he should drive, as Roger had never been to the headquarters.

The bright red Dodge Royal, with its white accents, pulled into the parking lot of the imposingly tall brewery headquarters. It wasn't out of place with the other luxury vehicles driven by company executives. What was out of place were the two disheveled men who climbed out.

Roger looked up at the tallest building in Whitefront, California. The small town had been booming the last few years as people flocked to the coast. The beer company, Waterhouse, and its CEO and founder had decided it was best to move their headquarters from the East Coast to California because of the growing market. To cut costs, they chose a small town, and ever since, the town had flourished.

Roger had never been here before. He worked at a small but lucrative law office. It was clear the town's success was largely due to this company.

They entered the reception area and spoke to the receptionist.

""Hey, I'm here to talk to Gordon. Tell him Frank is asking for him.""

The receptionist nodded. ""Ok, I'll let Mr. Gordon know before I leave. My shift is ending."" She got up from her desk and briskly walked out the back door. That's when someone Roger never wanted to see again entered to replace her.

""Roger! Why in the hell are you here?"" Roger's ex-wife, Jane, burst out.

Roger decided to briskly walk to the elevator with Frank, ignoring his ex-wife.

""Roger, you better get your ass—""

The elevator doors quickly closed, cutting off what she was about to say. Frank leaned over, clicking the fourth floor. Relaxing music played in the background as they ascended. He couldn't make out all the lyrics, but something about a beautiful night for a party echoed softly.

The elevator quickly closed, cutting off what she was about to say. Frank leaned over, clicking the button for the 4th floor. Relaxing music played in the background as they ascended. He couldn't catch all the lyrics, but it was something about a beautiful night for a party.

The elevator dinged, and the doors opened. Frank led Roger down the hall until they came to a door with Gordon's nameplate. They knocked.

""Come in!""

The door opened to a large, spacious office with floor-to-ceiling windows. Gordon, to Roger's surprise, was a young Black man with a wide, welcoming smile.

""Frank! Nice to see you, my old friend. And...?""

""Roger,"" he said curtly. Gordon's smile dimmed slightly at Roger's tone. Turning back to Frank, Gordon said, ""I heard about your retirement! Congratulations! Speaking of that, we still need to plan the retirement party—""

""I'm here on business, Gordon,"" Frank interrupted quickly.

""Aren't you retired?""

""I am. This is personal. I need to help my friend Roger here with a case.""

Gordon nodded. ""So, you need my help?""

""Yes,"" Frank responded.

""What do you need?"" Gordon asked.

Frank set a crumpled beer can on the desk.

""A beer can?"" Gordon said, confused.

""I need you to trace the serial number of this beer can to where it was sold. We suspect our suspect purchased this beer.""

Gordon nodded, then shuffled through papers and opened several filing cabinets before shaking his head.

""Nope, not here. It's probably in Quality Assurance. We keep the serial numbers in case we have to withdraw a product from shelves—makes it easier to know what was affected.""

Frank sighed in disappointment, but Gordon spoke up again.

""But I do have access.""

Gordon led Roger and Frank through the hallway into a large room with many cubicles. People typed away on typewriters. Roger observed Gordon, contemplating how, despite looking down on him, the man was still helping him. Strange.

Finally, they arrived at a locked door. Gordon pulled out a key and unlocked it. Inside were rows upon rows of filing cabinets. Frank sighed.

""This is going to take hours, isn't it?""

And it did. Hours passed as they sifted through files.

""This is taking forever!"" Roger complained.

""I found it!"" Gordon yelled out.

 It was exactly what they where looking for. 04/11/54—all the beer made that day and delivered that night. Skimming the files, they found the serial number they sought: C308.

Inside the file was a simple message, only three words long, that crushed the investigation instantly: ""Lost in Shipping.""

Roger almost wanted to cry. He had spent his entire Saturday chasing a lead that ultimately led nowhere. As they left, Frank turned to Gordon.

""Thanks again, man. Sorry to waste your time.""

Gordon nodded. Roger, feeling the need to show some gratitude, said, ""Thank you."" Gordon nodded again, understanding in his eyes.

The office was emptying as they walked through the cubicles, everyone heading home for the day. They took the elevator down.

""Damn it, Roger!""

They were immediately greeted by Jane as they stepped off the elevator. ""What were you doing up there all day, huh? Getting a lawyer to squeeze more out of the divorce? Buying another extravagant beer keg for your house?""

Roger just looked at her in exhaustion and defeat, shaking his head.

""Leave him alone, Jane; he's been through a lot today,"" Frank said earnestly.

""Leave him alone?! Leave him alone?! Oh boy, don't you have a lot of nerve. You're lucky we're in PUBLIC! I would cuss you out right now! He didn't leave me alone this morning, he didn't leave me alone during the divorce, he didn't even leave me alone when we were married! NO! I will not leave him alone.""

She kept going on and on as Frank dragged Roger back to the car. Roger insisted on driving.

""I need more than just a beer—something stronger,"" Roger said before starting the car and driving off.

""Where are we going?"" Frank asked.

""To the tiki bar.""

By the time they arrived, the bar was already starting to fill up. Frank and Roger went inside and sat down. Roger turned to Frank. ""Drinks are on me tonight for all the work we did today. How about a margarita?""

Frank looked at him and said, ""I've never had one.""

Roger looked at Frank in amazement. ""Never had one? They're great! Two margaritas, please.""

That's when a familiar face came into view. Janet from last night came up and sat next to them.

""Hi, Roger, nice to see you again.""

""Hey, Janet.""

""Is something wrong?""

Frank turned to her and said, ""He's down today. Someone... vandalized his pool.""

Janet turned back to Roger. ""Is there anything else I can do to help?""

Frank spoke up for Roger. ""Yes, there is. Roger said you weren't with anyone, as far as he knew, but if you were, they could have been the ones who did this.""

Janet nodded, thinking for a moment, before saying, ""I had a date with some guy named Mark, I think? No, wait..."" Janet thought for a moment. ""Max? No..."" Finally, she spoke up. ""Marty... some Marty Water... Horse?""

Frank looked at her, wide-eyed. ""Waterhouse?!""

Janet looked at him for a moment. ""Yes! That was it!""

Roger stared at her in amazement. ""So, you're telling me you ditched a rich millionaire beer tycoon to go on a date with me and didn't even remember his name?!""

Janet nodded. ""You were cute; he wasn't. I got super drunk.""

Roger abruptly got up and started walking toward the door.

""Roger! What about the margaritas?!"" Frank called after him.

""Put it on my tab! I need my Warm Justice!"" Roger replied.

""Roger, don't do this,"" said Frank, not chasing him.

""Roger, Marty is a dangerous man. He's the reason I retired! He and his men almost killed me!"" Frank desperately called out, but Roger wasn't listening.

""Who's going to take me home?!"" Frank said more to himself than to Roger. He was long gone.

Frank sighed. Maybe Janet would take him home. He walked back in the bar to finish the  margaritas that roger bought. 

Roger was speeding down the road, bee-lining it straight to Marty's house. He lived in the new wealthy neighborhood being built on the west side of town near the beach. He was doing well over the speed limit, and no stoplight or stop sign would stop him. He was getting angrier and angrier. Marty had no right—no right at all—to do that. Roger didn't even know he was there. Instead of acting like a child, Marty could have just spoken up about how Roger had stolen his date. But did he do that? No. He went out of his way to recruit an army of men to piss in Roger's brand-new pool.

By the time Roger pulled into the driveway of the mansion, he was furious. He saw that Waterhouse had one of those fancy electronic gates with a code. Of course, the flimsy gate was no match for Roger ramming it with his car at 65 MPH. The gates broke instantly, surprisingly causing minimal damage to the car.

Roger sat in the car for a moment, ""To late to second guess yourself now Roger,"" He said to himself. 

Roger slammed on the brakes, got out, and marched his way up to the door, holding a big lug wrench as his weapon. The door was far too sturdy for him to get through, but luckily for Roger, glass isn't as strong. He smashed the window in with the wrench before climbing inside, disregarding the glass shards that could have cut him if he weren't careful.

""WATERHOUSE! I'M HERE, ASSHOLE! COME ON OUT AND FIGHT ME!""

That's when, unexpectedly, a bottle smashed into Roger's face. Glass shards and beer went everywhere. It was a ball of fury and hate. The men fought wildly, clearly never having been in many physical fights. They tried every dirty move they could think of to get the upper hand. Eventually, Roger got the upper hand and threw Waterhouse outside into the mud before throwing himself on top of him.

They fought in the mud, blood, and beer. Punch after punch, Roger sent directly into Marty's face. Over and over again, until he paused. He looked up. Surrounding him were 300 men, all staring at Roger with bitter hatred.

Acting fast, Roger climbed back through the broken window. The way to the door was blocked by Gordon.

""I Forged that missing shipping document for a reason, damn it, Roger!""

Roger shook his head in amazement. ""Gordon!?""

Gordon started walking toward Roger. ""You just couldn't stay away, could you?""

Thinking fast, Roger hit Gordon over the head with the wrench. Before Gordon could regain his composure, Roger ran behind him to the front door. Locked. Gordon was already getting up, ready to lunge forward to grab Roger. That's when Roger saw it: the pull string to open the stairs to the attic.

He quickly pulled it down before scrambling up the stairs. Once inside, he pulled it back up behind him. He looked around eagerly for an escape. There was a window big enough to jump out of into the pool in the front yard.

Roger smashed the window with his wrench before quickly jumping out, diving into the pool. He quickly surfaced and scrambled out. He ran to his car and started it. The engine roared as reliably as ever. Roger quickly shifted into gear and took off.

He thought he was safe until he saw a pair of headlights. Then another. Car after car joined the chase. He sped up, slowed down, and went around and around the twisting hills, trying to get away from them. Eventually, he made it back into town, driving wildly through the empty streets. That's when—BOOM—the front tire suddenly burst on his Dodge. The car swerved, sending him into a light pole.

""Damn it, Roger! Are you drinking and driving again?!"" said an irritated voice.

In amazement, Roger realized he had just so happened to crash his car right in front of Jane. Before he could second-guess himself, he said, ""Get in the car!""

""Are you crazy, Roger? If not, you're drunk. The front tire popped! You need to change it, then you need to pay for the damn light pole you nearly snapped in half!""

Roger nervously glanced in the rearview mirror as headlights started shining on the far wall. ""Trust me, this one damn time, Jane—get in the car, or we both die!""

""Roger, shut up! You never listened to me. Why should I listen to you now? I didn't want the divorce, but you insisted, despite the fact that you were the one who cheated. And you know what? Thank you, Roger! It was the best decision of your life!""

Roger thought back to it and suddenly realized—she was right.

He had been a terrible husband, father, and person, and did not deserve a thing he owned. Roger sighed before looking up at Jane and, in earnest, said, ""You're right. I was a horrible husband and an even worse father to our children. I deserved every word and more—much more than what you've said. And I am so, so sorry. But Jane, I'm telling you right now—please believe me—we WILL BE DEAD in less than 30 seconds unless you get in this damn car right now!""

Jane looked down in amazement at Roger for a moment before actually opening the passenger door and getting in. ""You better be right.""

With that, Roger attempted to restart the car. The starter whirled. He clearly heard some fluid leaking from the car, and the hum of the engine got closer and closer as the first Chevy Impala started pulling into view.

Jane screamed in horror. Then the engine coughed, sputtered, and roared to life. Roger quickly threw the car in reverse and slammed on the gas. The car peeled out, now driving backward as it was chased.

""You know that trick with the handbrake to do a 180-degree turn like in the movies?""

""Roger, are you crazy?!""

""Maybe.""

Roger sharply turned the wheel, pulled the handbrake, popped the clutch, and shifted into gear before peeling away. ""There is no way I just did that!""

Roger navigated the streets swiftly and effectively until he turned off onto the street to exit town. There he saw the line of Oldsmobiles, with Marty Waterhouse standing in front of them, pointing a .44 revolver right at them.

Immediately, shots started being fired.

""Jane, get down!""

Both ducked under the dash. Roger sent the car careening straight into the blockade. CRASH. The sounds of twisted metal and breaking glass filled the air, along with more gunshots. Miraculously, Roger and Jane were unharmed.

They sat back up. Roger smiled at Jane. ""We did it!""

That's when the engine started sputtering. It coughed once, then twice, and then died. They were only a few hundred feet away.

Roger and Jane quickly got out and started running. BANG. The .44 went off.

""You better stop, you two, before you get shot,"" said Marty Waterhouse, now with severe damage—two black eyes, a broken nose that was bleeding, and several missing teeth.

""You've got yourself a little accomplice now, huh, Roger?""

Marty started walking toward them, the gun in his hand gleaming under the dim streetlights. The subtle tap, tap, tap of his footsteps echoed as he approached.

""You can't get away with this! They'll find us and trace it back to you!"" Roger spat out in desperation.

""I own this town, Roger. I have every dirty cop, the city council, and even the mayor under my thumb. This is easy, Roger.""

""You can't do this, Marty! How will you explain us going missing? The town just can't ignore it!"" Jane yelled.

""You're right, they can't. That's why I've planned how you'll die. I thought about pulling out your teeth one by one, then beating you to death. But honestly, I just want you gone. That's when it hit me—it's so simple. The newspapers will say, ""Local Man goes insane after someone peed in is pool, kills Ex-Wife in revenge""

Jane gasped in horror. Roger just stared at Marty, expressionless.

""Get the sacks, boys!""

Suddenly, a few of Marty's men came up behind Jane and Roger. They were shoved into burlap sacks and thrown into the trunk of Marty's car. Roger started hyperventilating. The darkness and tight confines of the bag were suffocating. He clawed at the fabric, desperate to escape, when a knife suddenly pierced through the material, cutting it open.

Above him was Jane, holding a pocket knife. ""Damn it, Roger, stop squirming. I might accidentally cut you,"" she whispered.

Eventually, she cut him fully free from the bag. The trunk was surprisingly spacious, allowing both of them to kneel.

""Okay, we need to get the hell out of here,"" Jane said urgently.

Roger nodded in agreement. Jane pulled out a multi-tool from her other pocket, using the toothpick attachment to work on the locking mechanism.

The lock soon popped open.

""Okay, Roger, we need to wait until the car stops—hopefully at a stoplight—so we can slip out and get away, okay?""

Roger didn't have time to respond before the car came to a halt.

""Now!"" she whispered urgently.

Roger quickly scrambled out of the cramped space and helped Jane out. That's when Roger noticed their stopping point: they were at his backyard. It was too late.

""Good job, you two,"" said a voice behind them.

They whipped around to see Marty Waterhouse walking toward them.

""You actually made my job easier—I don't even have to drag you out of the bags,"" he said, smiling menacingly, his gun glinting in the soft moonlight. Behind him, the pool glowed a faint, sickly yellow.

Marty cocked the hammer of the revolver. ""Any last words, Roger?""

""behind you!"" Roger shouted.

Marty whipped around, falling for the trick. He instantly realized his mistake when Roger's fist connected directly with his face. Roger tried to wrestle the gun away. Jane Tried to help but quickly was thrown off by Marty.

That's when Waterhouse gained the upper hand. He jabbed Roger in the stomach with his elbow, pushing him back. Roger doubled over in pain.

""I'll kill your ex-wife first, then!""

Before Marty could say anything else, an old black Oldsmobile smashed through Roger's back fence. Its siren blared as the car skidded to a halt.

Frank threw himself out of his car, his trusty service pistol in hand.

""Get on the ground, Waterhouse! You're under arrest!""

Marty put his hands up, knowing he was defeated. ""You were the only one I couldn't pay off,"" he said.

He threw the revolver forward, causing it to discharge and hit Frank in the foot. Frank cursed several times before walking over to Waterhouse and handcuffing him. Soon, the rest of the force arrived on the scene.

Roger was still stunned by the events when he turned to Jane.

""Roger!"" Jane cried.

She seemed to have just processed what had almost happened and threw her arms around him, sobbing into his shoulder.

""Roger, we almost died! We almost died! What would've happened if I hadn't—""

Roger cut her off. ""Don't think about that. We're safe. We're safe now.""

He held her in his arms for a long moment as the arrests continued in his backyard. She turned her face up to him, tears still shining in her eyes. He looked down at her, and in that moment, she was the most beautiful woman in the world.

""I sure did get revenge on the son of a bitch who peed in my pool didnt I?""

Jane laughed at the absurdity of it all. 

He leaned in and kissed her.

And so, on that day, 300 men were arrested, marking the largest arrest in California history. Gordon and Waterhouse were charged with multiple crimes, including Bribery, forged documents, tax evasion, and mass vandalism. 

Frank only came because of Janet bugged him to after Roger left and waited for Roger to come back. When Marty showed up instead he knew what to do. After this continued to enjoy his retirement, occasionally helping with small cases. Janet and Frank got married a couple of years later. Tammy, from Roger's third-grade class, took over the beer company and continued steering it toward success.

And Roger? He and Jane remarried that year and lived happily together, building a much healthier relationship. In the end, Roger's pool vandalism was covered by his homeowner's insurance, making the entire ordeal a petty tale of revenge gone awry. But hey, at least he brought down an entire crime ring and rekindled his relationship with his Ex-Wife right?

1i2ch4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i2ch4z/hm_the_general/,[HM] The General,"It was nearing midnight, and all was dark at the offices of the PDCO (Planetary Defense Coordination Office). The lights were always set to disable at 10pm sharp, which annoyed Johnson, whose shift ran from 10pm to 6am.

Johnson felt that he was not respected at this workplace. He was smart, diligent, and punctual, and his Masters degrees in astrophysics and computer science distinguished himself from many others in this field. However, having dedicated his life to his studies, he had grown into a fat, sweaty bald man with a high-pitched, squeaky voice and a perpetually shaky, anxious disposition. He had no girlfriend, no family, and no social life outside of work. Nevertheless, Johnson was proud of his academic achievements and believed his position at the PDCO to be both admirable and important to the world.

Johnson stared at his computer screen, illuminating his face in the indigo-shaded darkness of the room. He took a sip of his sweet milky coffee and a handful of some Cheez-Its while trying to shut out the sounds of the janitors vacuuming the neighboring offices. His job was easy, but dull; he had to monitor the skies for any chance of an NEO (near Earth object). He analyzed data from various telescopes across the world to detect any objects that could potentially impact the Earth. There were often many NEOs to be found, but it was unbelievably rare to find one headed directly towards the Earth; most just zipped on by without ever acknowledging this world teeming with life.

The phone rang, shocking Johnson out of his staring contest with his computer screen. Calls were rare, especially during the night shift, so Johnson felt a tremor of anxiety jolt through him. His clumsy hand reached awkwardly for the receiver, which slipped through his clammy palm, clattering on his desk. Johnson could hear a loud, gruff voice yelling through the phone: “God damn it, Johnson! Did you drop the phone again?! Sounded like a damn gunshot going off in my ear, you baboon!”

Johnson finally maintained his grip on the phone and held it up to his ear; his clumsiness had caused him to sweat even more profusely.

“Yes sir, sorry sir,” Johnson had a tendency to be overly formal with his superiors, much to their annoyance. The man on the phone was Donaldson, his rigid and loud-mouthed supervisor. “So, why are you calling? You never-“

“You’re probably wondering why I’m calling so late,” Donaldson interrupted. “I have important news. The General is coming.”

“The General?” Johnson had no idea who ‘The General’ was supposed to be. “As in… the U.S. military?”

“He was supposed to arrive earlier, but his flight was delayed,” Donaldson said, ignoring Johnson’s queries. “His time is limited, so he would still like a tour of our offices even though it’s after hours. I practically begged him to come tomorrow, but he insisted on visiting tonight. Since you’re the only one on duty, the task will fall to you.”

“Me? But sir, you know I have to constantly monitor-“

“Johnson, this is The General we’re talking about. His presence takes precedence over your duties. We have no other options.”

“W-well… Okay…”

“Fantastic,” said Donaldson, his voice dripping with condescension. “Oh, and one more thing: you’ve probably seen the Cheez-It snack bags that were left out on the breakroom table. Those are for day shift only. You are not to have any. We made sure to count them.”

Johnson gulped, looking down at the empty snack bag in his wastebin underneath his desk. “Guh… Yes, sir.”

“God knows you don’t need any more snacks, you fat bastard.” Donaldson suddenly roared an evil, scathing laugh that sounded like a vicious Rottweiler barking at a bird. “Anyways, I’m going to sleep. Don’t call me if you need anything.”

The line went dead.

Johnson, temporarily relieved to not be on a call with his boss any longer, had another pang of anxiety after realizing he hadn’t asked what the General was supposed to look like, his real name, his age, nothing. The General could be anyone. Johnson hoped it would be painfully obvious when the General arrived.

His computer began beeping, alerting him that an NEO had been spotted. This, again, was not abnormal; the computer found NEOs all the time. But as soon as Johnson focused in on what the computer had located, he nearly passed out in his chair. His heart jumped out of his chest. His minor sweat beads turned into a raging waterfall. His armpits moistened, his pupils dilated, his nipples hardened, and his hands began shaking with the ferocity of a 9.8 eathquake.

A massive asteroid. Hurtling directly towards Earth.

There was no mistaking it: the computer does the math well, but Johnson ran a few ancillary tests to confirm. Indeed, the asteroid was on a collision course with the Earth, and would collide within a day or two, based on its relative speed. It was huge; perhaps 2.5 - 3 kilometers wide. Typically, asteroids that size could be detected years, or even decades, in advance, but this asteroid appeared to be approaching from the direction of the Sun - what all astronomers know to be called the “solar blind spot”. This was indubitably the worst-case scenario.

Johnson, who had trained for this moment his whole life, sprang into action. He immediately called dispatch, who would connect him to the U.S. military. A bored woman answered his call.

“Dispatch.” she moaned dully.

“Yes, this is J-Johnson from the Arizona PDCO,” Johnson spit the words out frantically, trying and failing to maintain his composure. “There is a massive asteroid heading towards Earth, I need to speak to a high-ranking officer in the military immediately.”

The lady did not seem fazed. “You said Johnson?”

“Yes, ma’am, Johnson from the Arizona PDCO.”

“Isn’t that where The General is headed?”

“I, uh, yes…” Johnson furrowed his brow in confusion. “But that isn’t important right now. An asteroid, a huge, huge asteroid, will collide with Earth in roughly two days and cause unbelievable devastation! I need to be connected with someone immediately!”

“Hmm,” said the unaffected lady. “Most of ‘em are asleep right now and would rather not be awoken. Ooh, I have an idea, why don’t you just tell The General when he shows up?”

Johnson shook his head in disbelief, spurring a few beads of sweat to fly off him like skittish bugs. “Look, can I speak to someone else? Maybe someone who can understand the gravity of the situation?”

The lady laughed, a sharp, acerbic sound. “Gravity. Ha ha. I get it. ‘Cause you’re, like, a space guy.”

“That’s not what I-“

“I’m the only one on shift tonight, Johnson. Everyone else called off sick,” said the lady, and Johnson could hear her take a big gulp of something. “And to be honest - it’s my first day.”

“You’re kidding,” Johnson replied, his eyes widening in abject horror and frustration. “Well, you’re supposed to connect me with someone in the military. They need to take action on this as soon as possible.”

“I told you, they’re asleep.”

“Well, WAKE THEM UP!” Johnson suddenly screamed impatiently, surprising himself.

“I will not tolerate disrespect,” the lady stated, suddenly speaking in a sharp and mature tone. “Donaldson will be notified of your transgressive behavior.”

“I-I’m sorry!” Johnson wailed. “I just need you to take this seriously! This is a matter of life or death!”

No reply.

“Hello?!”

The line was dead. Johnson cursed and re-dialed. No answer.

“G-God damn it!” Johnson slammed his hammy fists on his desk, causing his coffee cup to spill on his keyboard and mouse. Johnson then tried calling Donaldson, who did not answer either. Feeling desperate, he then opted to call Donaldson’s boss. Donaldson would typically be furious that Johnson would go over his head, but he truly felt that he had no other choice.

“Robertson here,” said a grim, elderly voice on the line. “This better be good.”

“Robertson, it’s Johnson. Night shift.”

“Johnson? Donaldson’s employee? Why are you calling me in the middle of the night?!”

“There is an asteroid hurtling towards Earth. Nobody has answered my call except for you. We desperately need to alert the military.”

“Well, call dispatch. That’s your entire job.”

“I did. They were no help at all.”

“Hmph. I actually received a report that you disrespected a dispatch officer, verbally berating her until she felt no other option than to quit. Why would you do such a thing?”

Johnson squinted his eyes. “She quit?! Look, she wasn’t doing her one job of dispatching me to-“

“That is unacceptable behavior, Johnson. We will discuss this next time I’m in the office. I’d fire you right now if The General wasn’t coming in. You’re all set to meet him, correct? He should be there any second to inspect the facilities.”

“Just who is this General guy? If he’s so important, why aren’t any supervisors here to meet with him?”

“There’s that disrespect again. Johnson, if I hear you utter even a single disrespectful syllable to The General, I will make your life a living hell. I won’t just fire you, I’ll fuck you. For life.”

Johnson paused.

“But sir… The asteroid…”

“Christ, again with this asteroid bullshit. Just tell The General. He’ll know what to do.”

The line went dead abruptly.

Just then, before Johnson could even register that the call had ended, a janitor walked in with a serene look on his face.

“Señor… The General es here.”

Johnson blinked, his heart surging in his chest. He had no idea what to expect, but he was anxious anyway.

He hastily put his coat on and walked to the front entrance of the spaceport. Across the street sat a dark, ominous limousine; Johnson wondered why they didn’t park closer to the actual entrance. A silent driver, who looked more like a walking corpse with his skinny body and pale skin, gave Johnson’s presence zero acknowledgement as he slowly lifted himself out of the car and slowly walked to the rear door of the vehicle. He moved so slowly and so quietly thay Johnson felt as if he were watching a surreal play, especially with the moonlight’s glow being the only thing illuminating the scene.

But finally, the driver opened the door.

A man with a button-down shirt, red as blood, and a long, black leather duster stepped out of the vehicle with a confident swagger Johnson had never before witnessed. This man carried himself like a celebrity, or a sports star, or a used car salesman. He had shockingly white teeth, possibly veneers, that seemed to smile and grimace at the same time, like a demented Gary Busey. His greying hair was slicked back like a 1950s greaser. A cigarette dangled out of his mouth, but no smoke was emitting from its tip; was it merely a prop? He wore clean, perfectly ironed jeans that dropped down to his domineeringly large cowboy boots. He looked like a character from a Tarantino movie that Harvey Keitel would typically play.

This man was an enigma. He just had to be The General. There was no mistaking it.

The General looked directly at Johnson, sizing him up. It seemed he was not too pleased with what he saw.

“I’m here.” said The General, a hint of disdain in his voice.

“A-are you The General?” Johnson asked. He was intimidated by the man’s sheer confidence.

“Am I The General?” The General giggled and looked at his driver, who laughed as well. “He’s asking me if I’m The General.”

Johnson blinked, feeling pathetic.

“I need to be shown around,” said The General, finally stepping towards Johnson, his cowboy boots clinking metallically with each step. “You will serve as my guide. Do only as I say or you will be severely punished. Do you understand?”

“I, uh, I suppose…”

“My god, you are pathetic,” The General said, sneering at Johnson. “You really must take more pride in your appearance. You’re sweating as if you just ran a marathon, but I presume your job requires no manual labor. A desk jockey! Tell me, is it a condition? Or do I make you nervous? You may answer.”

“To be quite honest, sir…” Johnson gulped. “I found an asteroid headed towards the Earth, which is set to collide with us within one to two days. Approximately.”

The General lip-smiled sheepishly and looked back at his driver, who met him with only a blank, emotionless stare. He then looked back at Johnson.

“How interesting. Yes, yes, this is quite an interesting development indeed!” The General began pacing with his hands behind his back. “I knew there was a reason that I was supposed to come here tonight. I knew it.”

“So… you’ll call someone? So we can do something about it?”

The General smirked mockingly at Johnson.

“No. No, my dear boy. You do not become someone of my status by merely leaning on others for help. You and I, we will take action here, tonight. We don’t need anybody else.”

“S-sir, but-“

“I did not tell you to respond, did I?” The General raised his hand and smacked Johnson’s cheek with an unyielding strike. Johnson yelped like a wounded coyote. “Now, bring me inside, and we’ll figure this out. Like men!”

Johnson begrudgingly led The General into the lobby of the spaceport, greeted by an empty front desk and a darkened room. Johnson heard this room was often very welcoming during the day, but it took on a foreboding look in the dead of night.

“This is the lobby,” Johnson said, continuing towards the elevators. The General grunted, looking around with a stern and focused expression. Johnson hit the ‘up’ button. “Now I’m going to show you the 2nd floor, where I work.”

They stepped into the elevator, where a dainty jingle was playing. The elevator lurched upwards, and quickly settled on the 2nd floor with a jarring ‘ding’.

Johnson saw the janitor down the hallway, who, upon noticing, stood up straight and saluted. Johnson, confused, looked at The General, who nodded as if this was expected behavior. The janitor maintained this salute as they passed by and into the breakroom.

“Ah, Cheez-Its, morsels of the gods,” The General said, somehow unironically, and grabbed a small bag off the table.

“Ah, sir, those are for day shift only…” Johnson felt as though he was talking to the wind.

“Day shift. P’shaw!” The General ripped open the bag and poured the entirety of its contents into his gaping maw. “I am the All-Shift. Shifter of worlds. I can turn Day Shift into Night Shift and Night Shift into Day Shift.”

Johnson made a conscious effort to disregard this comment, and opened the door to the large, dark room that contained his office. At the far end of the room was a single window that took up the entire wall, serving as a viewing port for the Space Shuttle down the tarmac, about a half mile away. The sight of the shuttle often inspired Johnson, and reminded him of why he went into this field in the first place. It seems The General was struck by this sight as well; his eyes lit up and filled with tears, while his mouth hung open, just slightly agape in wonder.

“A tower… No, a monument to the Heavens. Mankind’s ultimate goal, fulfilled. Not just a marvel of engineering, but a marvel of imagination, determination, and victory over science. Victory over God, even. Beautiful.”

“Yeah… we have a launch scheduled for next week. Just to test some of our propulsion syst-“

“This is why I’m here. I understand now.”

Johnson was confused by The General’s ramblings, and vainly attempted to soldier on with the tour. “Yep, and over here is my desk.”

“You will allow me onto the spaceship,” The General said, still looking directly at the shuttle, spellbound. “You will launch me towards the asteroid. I am The Savior. I understand it all now. This is my purpose.”

Johnson, confounded, shook his head. “Look, I know you’re The General and all, but I can’t just… launch you. This is a billion dollar project, plus it would take a whole team to get it to work. Also, you’re not trained, your safety cannot be guaranteed, and-“

“These are all excuses. Matters of semantics. We are two men tasked with finding a solution for a danger that threatens all of humanity. I am not a fan of bureaucracy. I take charge. All of mankind is at stake here, yet you’re still too filled with trepidation to actually do anything about it? It’s time to take charge and stop being the pathetic animal you’ve been your entire life.”

Johnson blinked.

“Can you get me on that spaceship?”

“I mean… y-yes.”

“Do you know how to initiate the launch sequence?”

“Uh… yeah, I guess I know what needs to be done…”

“Very good. I will handle the rest. I will eliminate the asteroid, even if it costs me my life. Safety be damned. This is our purpose.”

Johnson couldn’t help but feel inspired by The General’s words. In many ways he was just happy this matter was finally being taken seriously by someone, even if it was only by this eccentric man.

“Now. What do we need to do to get this bird airborne?”

Johnson explained that the shuttle was already fueled and fully tested for the upcoming launch, and all that was needed to be done was the countdown sequence, which would only occur once The General was in the ship’s cockpit. The rocket would need to be armed, the tanks pressurized, and the spacecraft fully powered up. Typically this was done by a team of people, but Johnson understood the basics of what needed to be done, as most of the hardest bits of the mission were already completed.

“Good. Very good! We were put on this Earth to meet each other at this precise moment for this specific reason. I will save the world, but I need you to be the Shepherd to my Savior. Understand?”

The General’s charisma was overwhelming. Johnson didn’t understand, but he still nodded, as if in a hypnotic trance.

The General walked out of the building, and Johnson watched from the viewing port as the limousine drove out to the parked shuttle, like a lamb to the slaughter. At this distance, Johnson could barely see, but with a bit of squinting, he watched as The General climbed the precarious ladder leading to the cockpit. After a few minutes, The General’s voice sounded from the computer.

“Alright, Shepherd, I’m in place and buckled in. Not that it matters!” An uproarious laugh echoed from the comm system, causing a high-pitched feedback noise to scratch Johnson’s earbuds. “You’re going to launch me right at that fucking asteroid, and I’m going to obliterate it!”

“But what exactly is the plan here?” Johnson asked. “It’s not like the ship is equipped with asteroid-destroying lasers.”

“It’s simple. Elementary. I’m going to collide with the asteroid at a high speed to alter its trajectory. I’m going to give it a good bump and move it away from Earth!”

Johnson considered this. “Kinetic impact… of course. That could actually work. But that’s suicide!”

“It’s every man’s dream to die for something larger than himself,” The General replied. “We’re running out of time, and I’m running out of patience. Initiate the launch sequence.”

Johnson began powering up the rocket while running through the tasks on his timed checklist.

Rocket: armed.
Tanks: pressurized.

After approximately 15 minutes, the spacecraft was powered up, and dawn was beginning to break.

“We’re all set. I locked your coordinates directly towards the asteroid. We just need to do the countdown!”

Johnson couldn’t wait for this. It was every astronomer’s dream to do the countdown.

“FUCK the countdown, let’s fucking ROLL!”

Once again, maniacal laughter emanated from the comm system, and soon enough, Johnson was laughing hysterically too. Their riotous laughter was almost in sync.

Johnson hit the button.

Beautiful, menacing plumes of smoke and fire erupted from the bottom of the spacecraft. The haunting bellow of the rocket blasted through the room, and directly into Johnson’s soul. Everything shook, as if the ground too was nervous of what was about to happen. Beyond the roar of the rocket, Johnson could only hear The General hooting and hollering loudly as the ship took off at an incredible speed.

Johnson cried.

The next morning, the sun came up, and the world continued turning.

I’ve been reflecting a lot lately, and I guess that’s what brought me here. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized how easy it is to lose the closeness we once had with people. Friends move away, life gets busy, and those deep, meaningful connections start to fade. I’m here hoping to find someone to rebuild that with — something real and lasting.

I’m Carlos, 32, based in California. I work a steady job that keeps me busy, but in my downtime, I’m all about the little things that bring me peace. I love music (I’m always looking for new playlists), getting lost in a good book, and watching anime to unwind. Coffee is my go-to comfort, whether it’s a quiet morning cup or a late-night conversation over a fresh brew. Lately, I’ve also found a lot of joy in gardening — there’s something calming about taking care of plants and watching things grow.

What I’m looking for is simple: genuine connection. Someone who wants to talk about life, passions, dreams, and even the random little things that make us who we are. Whether it’s deep conversations or lighthearted banter, I’m here for both. Romance isn’t necessarily the goal, but if something more grows from a connection, I wouldn’t be opposed.

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s see if we can make this disconnected world feel a little smaller.

Take care.

1i2cf43,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i2cf43/splife_debt/,[SP]Life Debt,"Kids can be cruel. One time they would pit insects against one another in a jar. Another, they would kick away a cat preparing to strike down a prey.

Today it was Tommy. He was in a good mood, whistling, or at least trying to, the song they learned at school. It was hot, and he had bought water ice with cola taste. His favorite.

Yesterday it was hot too, he had orange taste then. Another favorite. After he had played doctor, they had taken turns saying ""aaah"" and putting a wooden stick in each other's mouth. It nearly made him puke. Maybe he was going to be a doctor. He laughed. The day was even better.

A crow, blinded by the Sun, exhausted by the heat, had flown against a window. It now lay dazed on the ground. The large orange cat that prowled the neighborhood was slowly stalking closer.

Tommy wanted to see the bird, so without much thought or effort, he kicked the cat away. The cat mostly managed to jump away and left with a thick tail and the disdain even royalty find hard to match.

He went on his knees and looked at the bird. It didn't even try to fly away. ""Poor birdy,"" Tommy said. With that, he picked up the bird and held it to its chest. The bird moved a bit, but his embrace was too strong.

He wanted to make the bird better. He wanted to see if he could make it fly again.

""Grandpa said it is so hot he had to hose down his dogs with water,"" Tommy thought out loud. ""I'm gonna put you under the tap."" With that, Tommy, large for his age, strode to the garden hose and pulled it loose. Then he started the water running and held the bird right under it. The bird was still hardly moving in his other hand.

This changed when the bird was under the running water for a few seconds. The bird suddenly came alive again and shook itself free, flying away.

Years later, he imagined he had heard the bird say ""We... wiLL... RETurN... ThE... FAVor..."" while it flew away, back to its murder. He gave it not much thought.

More important was that he had made the bird fly again. Now he knew it. He wanted to be an animal doctor. He was going to tell his grandpa!

Tommy slowly became Tom, shedding the bright-eyed innocence of childhood. Over the years, Tom changed into Thomas: a man who didn’t believe in much anymore.

He led a meager existence from a dwindling veterinary. He seemed to lack empathy. Detached, he did his job and spoke hardly to the customers.

Saving many animals, that he did. And when they were beyond rescue, he made sure their suffering was short. Then he would hand the former owners the bill. He lost customers.

Many times he had nearly made a wrong choice. Almost had started to dabble in drugs to keep up his study and side job. With what had seemed like luck, another job practically jumped into his lap.

Another time a criminal with a shotgun wound wanted to be patched up. It had stayed with that one. A golden bracelet he found in the garden granted him financial reprieve.

Today, he stood watching the huge fire from an exploded gas station. He had just before stepped out, cursing some bird had shit on his front window, wiping it clean.

He thought he had imagined the crow saying. Now he was not so sure anymore.

Within seconds, the fire in the distance roared to the sky, some faint explosions indicating the fire reached the next tank. The smoke above started to block the stars in what was a clear sky.

For a moment, Thomas stared at the fire. Then he turned back to the front window, a vague smear still visible. For the first time in years, he started to giggle and then laugh.

Several police cars and firefighting trucks passed, with loud sirens. Then a police car stopped next to his. ""Hello sir, can you explain to me why you are laughing?""

No matter how hard he tried to convince them it was the bird shit, a moment later he's at the local police station. A phone in hand. One call, they said. Make it short. Who was he going to call? His brother Kyle, of course. He was a lawyer. He was his exact opposite. All joviality on the outside, but as cold as ice within.

The officer spurred him on. ""Are you going to make that call?""

Handcuffed, he typed his brother's number.

""Kyle? This is Thomas here."" A minute later, Thomas had explained the situation, succinct as he always was. His brother's reaction was even more abrupt and sharp: ""I'll be there.""

Thomas struggled not to tremble when he handed back the phone. He had counted on his brother's easy-going nature to sweet-talk him out of this. It sounded as if his brother was on the warpath.

He had saved his younger brother many times. Most of the time, Kyle was an easy-going fellow. But against those who opposed him too much, another side could appear. One that got him in trouble.

Now they lived separate lives, Kyle in the city. The crow and the fox they had called them back at school. Their pranks on the edge of sanity.

""Feeling guilty?"" The officer asked. ""Tell me again, why you stopped just before the gas station, while you were almost out of gas? We checked your car, you know.""

He did not feel guilty. He just did not want all the hassle with his brother going all in again. He did not want his brother locked up with him. A small smile appeared on Thomas' face again when he thought whether it was that he didn't want his brother in jail or that he didn't want to be locked up with him.

Another officer walked in, a few papers in hand. “And?”

“His story remains the same. Every goddamn detail matches up. No slips.”

The new officer glanced at Thomas and then back at their colleague. “Let me take over. It's pretty warm in here, why don't you take a breather?”

With a nod, the first officer left. The newcomer settled into the seat across from Thomas, leaning forward slightly. “So, you’re sticking to your story. Interesting that you’ve thought it through so well—almost too well. Anything you’re not telling us?”

Thomas smirked faintly, his usual dry tone surfacing. “Yes, but I don’t want to tell.”

The officer raised an eyebrow. “Fair enough. And your brother, the lawyer, is on his way, right?”

“That’s right.”

The officer straightened up, making a show of shuffling the papers. “Here’s the deal. We’re swamped with reports from the gas station fire, and it’d save everyone time if you just waited here until your brother arrives. We’ll need your, uh… witness report of the incident anyway.”

Thomas gave a slow nod, suppressing a laugh. “Sure. I’ll wait. Not like I have anywhere else to be.”

The officers had left him alone, but Thomas felt anything but at ease. He sat there, staring blankly at the wall, his mind racing through years of fragmented memories. Small incidents, so many that seemed unconnected. But those few, those involving birds? They gnawed at him. Was it his imagination? Was he piecing together a narrative to make sense of chaos?

He should use the solitude to sort through it. Or, if nothing else, come to peace with it.

What felt like a brief moment stretched into over an hour. The untouched coffee on the table had long gone cold when the door opened.

Kyle strode in, commanding the room with his long black coat and a brown briefcase in hand. His presence was as sharp as ever. He extended a hand, his smile thin. “Hello, Thomas.”

Without waiting for a response, he turned to the officer standing guard by the door. “Could I have a moment with my client in private?”

Minutes later, with the door firmly shut, Thomas recounted the story again, feeling the weight of repetition pressing down on him. But with Kyle, he said more.

“A bird shat on my window,” Thomas said quietly, eyes fixed on the untouched coffee. “I stopped to clean it, and right then, the gas station exploded in front of me. I laughed because… because that bird saved my life. That’s all. At least, that’s all I told them.”

Kyle tilted his head, his expression unreadable. “And what didn’t you tell them?”

Thomas hesitated, then leaned forward, his voice dropping to a near whisper. “Nobody’s going to believe this. But I once saved a bird -- a crow. I feel like… like they’ve been watching over me ever since.”

Kyle’s face broke into a slow grin, his tone a mix of amusement and calculation. “I believe you.” He paused. “Or at least, I believe you enough to spin this into something useful. This? This is a goldmine, Thomas.”

""A goldmine,"" Thomas thought. The case had turned out to be nothing. Barely a blip on the radar. The bigger news outlets weren't interested. The local paper, though, had made one last attempt. They would send someone.

He sat in the café, coffee in hand, watching the door. The soft hum of jazz filled the air, giving the place an almost detached sense of reality. The journalist, if you could call someone who wrote about haunted houses and herbal teas a journalist, had requested the meeting here.

A young woman, about his age, entered the shop. Her figure was magnetic, but Thomas barely let his gaze linger. Not before an interview. Almost instinctively, he scanned the room to see if she was here for anyone else. No one. It was just him.

When he looked back, she had already slid into the seat across from him, extending her hand with a smile. ""Hi, I'm Ellen Waltsen. Journalist for The Town Tribune.""

And so, Thomas told his story again. Maybe she had a bit of that journalist instinct after all. She asked questions, each one probing deeper, yet somehow he felt at ease with her. She was sharp, perceptive in ways that made him pause, but not in a way that felt like an interrogation.

He choked on his coffee when she asked, “So, a bird saved you, and you save animals. Are you sure there’s no connection there?”

Thomas flushed, the effort to keep from spilling his coffee somehow intensifying the rush of heat in his cheeks. “Sorry,” he muttered, still gasping slightly. “I can’t tell.”

Here's the second half with only spelling and minor corrections, without any changes to the text:

She dabbed at the spilled coffee with a paper napkin, her eyes narrowing with quiet curiosity. “And off the record?” Her tone was knowing, as if she could sense there was more lurking beneath the surface.

Before Thomas could stop himself, the words slipped out. “I… I once saved a crow when I was a kid.”

“That’s everything?” Ellen asked, leaning back slightly, a hint of disappointment in her voice.

Thomas tensed. He didn’t want her to think he was holding back, or worse, that she had wasted her time. Without thinking, he blurted out something he’d never even shared with Kyle. “I thought I heard the bird say something when it flew away. It... it sounded like, ‘We will return the favor.’”

Ellen’s expression shifted instantly. She leaned forward, her interest now palpable, eyes locked onto his. “What do you think that means?”

""Shit on my window,"" Thomas muttered, and they both burst into laughter.

Ellen wrote a charming article that made it all seem far more profound than it really was. She was good at that, making things feel bigger and more important. Thomas almost forgot about her entirely.

But as the days passed, more and more people began bringing their pets to him, whispering behind his back that he had some kind of connection with animals.

Thomas shrugged. He didn’t care what people said about him. They’d always talked. All that mattered was the animals.

Then Ellen showed up with her cat. She asked him a few more questions, but this time, she didn’t leave. Thomas did not see Kyle often, but he was there on that special day.

On their wedding day, just after the ceremony had ended, Ellen felt something hot land on her head. Disgusted, she reached up, pulling the sticky substance from her hair.

Thomas burst out laughing. “It seems the crows have blessed you too.”

I leave for work by 8am and get home by 8pm 6days a week.  Often kid still asleep by the time i leave for work so normally I would like to play or spend time with kid (5yo) after i get home until he falls asleep maybe 10pm  by that time tho i am sleepy myself and fall asleep myself.  But work demands i spend even more time working or work piles up. 

I am considering spending longer hours in the office maybe 3 days a week meaning i get home 9 or 10 already... So i can go more guilt free with loved one the other 3 days and sundays.  But that would mean not seeing kid for entire day those 3 days and again feeling guilty abt that

I also thought about eating drive thru on way home so i dont have to spend time at home eating instead of spending time...but that will take away time with my kid decades from now. 

Already drinking coffee to get by

Something like that which would act as a guide as to an absolute minimum a person should be considering if they were hiring in that location.

I just completed my first worldpackers program in Summer 2024, and I am currently planning (and saving up for) a whole year of worldpackers traveling. I’d love more advice on how much you’d recommend saving up.

Locations: ~3 months in South America, ~1 month in Mexico/Costa Rica/Caribbean, ~4 months in Mediterranean Europe, ~1 month in Japan, ~2 months in SE Asia/Indonesia/Malaysia, ~1 month in Eastern Australia.

I am only accepting programs that offer at least 1 meal per day, and for breakfast I usually get by with a simple coffee. Lunch I can buy groceries for. I am also a great cook, and would cook if we have a kitchen/if the program has a system where the host buys groceries for the volunteers.

I would also like to plan in various 1-week trips to other places that I won’t be volunteering in. For example, if I volunteer in Argentina, maybe go a week to Rio de Janeiro. Maybe go a week to Morocco, a week to Turkey, a week to China, etc. I would plan to stay in a hostel or with family/friends in these cases. This is certainly where I could rack up more cost.

Outside of volunteering, I like to explore nightlife, and try some local restaurants - usually nothing too expensive.

I wouldn’t be shopping much, especially because I would only take my 35L cotopaxi and a smaller bag.

Hi, 

I’m 34M from Britain (England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great have more close friendships. I am based in Northamptonshire, however, it would be great to meet new people and friends in nearby cities to me such as Leicester (which is around 30 minutes away from me by train), and where it is more easy distance-wise to meet up in person  more regularly and where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I like to play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).


I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.



If anyone may be interested in chatting and looking to make new friendships, and if anyone shares the same social interests and hobbies, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect.

1i2bxj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schola_Illusoria/comments/1i2bxj8/florida_mans_sermon_on_the_holy_tools_of_freedom/,"FLORIDA MAN’S SERMON ON THE HOLY TOOLS OF FREEDOM: VPNs, PROXY CHAINS, AND SOCKS5","Brothers and sisters, gather close, for the world has become a treacherous swamp, and I’m not just talking about the gators out back. I’m talking about the gators dressed as lawmakers, snapping at your freedom and chewing through your God-given right to browse the internet in peace. These swamp creatures tell you, “We’re protecting you,” but what they mean is, “We’re watching you.” And when they block your path, when they slap up walls where there should be bridges, I say unto you: “Fear not! For the tools of digital liberation are at hand!” Today, my sermon is about three holy pillars of internet freedom: the VPN, the Proxy Chain, and the SOCKS5 Proxy. Tools so mighty, they make Pharaoh’s chariots look like a child’s wagon. Tools so sharp, they cut through lies like a hot knife through a Florida mango. First, let us speak of the VPN—Virtual Private Network for the uninitiated. A VPN is your cloak of invisibility, your parting of the digital Red Sea. When the tyrants of the web say, “You cannot pass!” the VPN whispers, “Try me.” It masks your IP address, encrypts your traffic, and sends it through a secure tunnel to a far-off land where censorship is but a faint echo.

Now, some will tell you, “Using a VPN is suspicious!” To that, I say: If privacy is suspicious, then so is locking your front door. Shall we leave our homes wide open for every thief and busybody? Of course not! And yet these same folks want you to leave your digital doors flung wide, so they can peek inside and say, “What’s all this then?” A VPN does not hide evil— it protects good. It’s not a mask for criminals; it’s a shield for the righteous. But wait, brethren! The VPN is just the beginning. The tyrants grow clever, seeking to block even the cloaked traveler. And so, I present to you the second tool: the Proxy Chain. Now, this is no ordinary shield; it’s a labyrinth, a twisting maze of connections that would make even Theseus scratch his head. A proxy chain bounces your traffic from one server to another, scattering your trail like breadcrumbs in a hurricane. By the time the tyrant catches wind of you, you’re already three steps ahead, sipping coffee in a digital café halfway across the world. But let us not stop there! For the truly devout seeker of freedom, I bring you the SOCKS5 Proxy. Ah, SOCKS5! The name alone inspires reverence. SOCKS5 is not just a tool; it’s a scalpel. Where the VPN is your hammer, smashing through barriers, and the Proxy Chain is your cloak, confounding the watchers, SOCKS5 is the precise, surgical instrument for the trickiest of tasks. It provides speed, flexibility, and compatibility with nearly any application. It’s the Swiss Army knife of digital liberation, the holy multitool of the free internet.

Now, I can hear the skeptics already. “But Florida Man,” they say, “isn’t all this a bit much? Isn’t it easier to just obey the rules?” Easier? Sure. Just like it’s easier to let the alligator take your leg rather than fight it off. Just like it’s easier to bow to Pharaoh than to march through the wilderness. But let me remind you, freedom was never meant to be easy. It’s meant to be right. And make no mistake, the tyrants will not stop at banning websites. Today it’s PornHub, tomorrow it’s your forums, your news, your very ability to ask questions and seek answers. They don’t want you informed; they want you compliant. And so, I say to you: arm yourselves with knowledge. Master the tools of freedom. Let the VPN be your helmet, the Proxy Chain your shield, and the SOCKS5 Proxy your sword.

For the time is coming—and indeed is already here—when the free internet will only belong to those who fight for it. The watchers, the censors, the blockers of pathways will gnash their teeth and cry, “Why won’t these people just stay in line?” And you, the digital Davids, will look back at them with a smirk and say, “Because I’ve got a VPN, a Proxy Chain, and a SOCKS5, and there ain’t a wall you can build that I can’t climb.” Amen, and pass the encryption keys. Let the tyrants tremble in their ignorance, for the free shall inherit the web! ",1,1736986314.0,Schola_Illusoria,0,1.0,False

I didn't get any emails from s this morning, but I still had a few work tasks to complete that I decided I would do later in our local coffee shop for a change of setting. 


I took a walk with b after doing my morning rituals. I was planning on going to the gym, but I wanted to spend more time with her. im not sure what us spending more time together means, though, so im gonna try not to get my hopes up. 


b showered while I started reading this book called ""the midnight library"" it's okay so far. im hoping that I find solace and familiarity in this read, as the main character has depression and a lot of regrets. she's very stubborn and a little annoying, though, so im not sure how much im going to be able to relate to her. b got out the shower, we did the usual after shower activities, talked about the book im reading, then we both went on our phones. 


I opened a text L sent me at 6:27am that said, ""and rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed.""  I found this to be motivating and a great verse to illustrate how I envy her.


 L posts a lot about her faith on social media. some of her posts are little vlogs of her reading her bible. she makes it look so peaceful, relaxing, and enlightening. when I try to pray or read my bible in a silent, dim lit room, my mind is everywhere but on what im reading. I start having thoughts like ""fuck you God. I don't even believe in you"" or "" you should be ashamed of yourself for allowing so much evil in this world. I hate you"" the other day I called his mom a hoe...


 when this happens, I immediately start apologizing and feeling guilty and frustrated. I wonder if that happens to her too? we aren't very close and well... she's L, so im not just gonna ask her if she's ever called God's mom a hoe. 


b was staring at my phone screen when I opened that message from L. she questioned me about why me and L had so many exchanges with bible verses. I explained that I wanted to feel closer to God as one of my new years resolutions, and how L offered to be my bible buddy, as that was one of hers too. half way through my explanation, she grabbed my phone, and started scrolling through our texts. as I continued explaining, I felt more and more ashamed and embarrassed. 


she told me that our texts are corny, how much we talk about God feels culty, I need to pick less lame friends, and that she doesn't want to date me if im going to turn into one of the ""weird Christians"". this is why I would have preferred to keep that to myself. I know that she's not doing it on purpose but sometimes she makes me feel very judged and self conscious☹️


 moving along, after she went to work, I stayed in bed for 3 hours watching adventure time. I don't know why I got so lazy. I guess that reboot yesterday wasn't enough. I had planned to be productive and that was a big chunk of my day spent watching episodes I have already seen 4+ times.

 
it got so late that I was questioning if I should even still go to the coffee shop. I decided to go because I was hungry and still had work to get done. I didn't get there until 4pm, and I only stayed for 20 minutes because I just wasn't feeling being around other people. 


the rest of my day was spent working for the most part. 


I wish that this job didn't put so much pressure on me to have things done as soon as possible. it can be so fun but get frustrating real quick when you're feeling unmotivated and depressed. im surprised that ive been able to somewhat keep up with it despite not feeling the best.",1,1736986207.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

Managing finances can sometimes feel like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but what if I told you there are some awesome apps out there that make it WAY easier? Yep, apps aren’t just for scrolling memes and taking selfies—some of them actually *help* you get your financial act together!

I remember when I first tried budgeting on my own. Long story short, it involved a lot of post-it notes and the occasional tearful breakdown over my coffee budget. 🤦‍♂️ But then I discovered these cool apps, and let's just say my financial life got a serious upgrade. Want to know which ones? Let me spill the tea:

- **YNAB (You Need a Budget):** Ever wished your money could report to you every day? Meet YNAB. It's like having a personal finance coach that fits right in your pocket. It’s all about giving every dollar a job. So, if you've ever wondered, “Where did all my money go?” YNAB’s got your back.

- **Mint:** Think of Mint as the all-seeing eye of budgeting apps. It connects to your bank accounts and tracks EVERYTHING. Want alerts when you’re approaching that budget limit? Done. Want a breakdown of your spending by category? Easy peasy. It’s like Mint knows you better than you know yourself.

- **PocketGuard:** Feeling overwhelmed by the mass of numbers when budgeting? PocketGuard is like that chill friend who always tells you how much you can safely spend today without feeling guilty. It's a great choice if you prefer something straightforward and snappy.

- **Goodbudget:** If you’re the type who loved the idea of the envelope system but hated the idea of actual envelopes, this one’s for you. You virtually set aside money for expenses in different ‘envelopes,’ and voilà, controlled spending in the 21st century style.

- **EveryDollar:** Created by personal finance guru Dave Ramsey, EveryDollar sticks to a zero-based budgeting model, meaning you plan where every single dollar is going... even that sneaky $1 hiding in the corner. 

Switching up how you manage your money can be a game-changer. Maybe you'll find that budgeting isn't so much about cutting out all fun, but more like *prioritizing* what means the most to you. Who knows? You might discover you can save for that dream vacation or finally get that snazzy gadget without guilt. 🤩

So, which app do you think you’ll try first? Or hey, if you've already embarked on the budgeting-app journey, what’s your verdict? Would love to hear your stories—especially if they involve previously underestimated coffee budgets, like mine. 😉",1,1736986011.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1i2brmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/1i2brmk/fish_cheese_notes_on_certain_game_aspects_i_wish/,Fish & Cheese: Notes on certain game aspects I wish I knew in advance (PC),"I wanted to share some of my experience playing the game. I picked it up recently, loved the hell out of it (it helped me during my sickness, I struggled for a couple of days with a near-40 degrees temperature, and just played it to keep my mind occupied), but I also saw ""conflicting"" advice on Reddit that piled up over the years, and is not as easy to google, and, through trial and error, found certain nuances that I'd like to share, in case someone else tries this game for the first time.

Again, sorry, if this info is elsewhere on the board, but I didn't find any detailed instructions myself, hence I felt there might be someone, who could make use of this.

**Fishing:**

1. First time will always be difficult. If you are like me and want to max out the amount of points you get for this activity, just try to catch one fish on the first try. To do that, target the small fish that's closest to where Joker is, e.g. closest to the edge of the pond -- that'll make it more likely for you to succeed.
2. Something I didn't understand till later -- the direction keys (A and D) control the positioning of the pointer in the middle of the screen. Don't mash the ""space"" key (e.g. the ""pull"" key) too often, and use the direction keys to steer the pointer into the red zone. If you press ""pull"" outside of the red zone, you will tilt the pointer closer to the edge. With the Guardian, you will most certainly lose a point of durability that way (the number on the left of the fishing gauge), and you'll be frustrated.
3. Buy the book about fishing in Shinjuku after the first try. Read it. It will not change the fishing mechanic itself, but it will allow you to see, which fishes you should go for. Press ""ctrl"" during the fishing process to highlight the fishes in the pond, and check the advice below.
4. To maximize the amount of points, buy only Large lures (they cost 250 points each; not the Top ones for 400). Depending on your proficiency, you'd be able to catch a certain number of fish. Is the Guardian shows up (it has a golden glow and looks like an eel), buy a Suspicious Lure if you have the points. The Guardian usually shows up after you caught a set amount of fish in a row, but on rainy / bad weather days it can show up earlier. It will only show up once per session, though.
5. If the Guardian is not there, target the **large light-blue fish** with red tails (not the solid blue ones!). Make sure there are sparkles around the fish you wish to catch, as they will double your points. If you don't see any fishes of this description, you can quit out of the fishing menu (press the right mouse button), when Mona asks you what's up, tell him that you wish to ""check the prices"". You will then enter dialogue with the keeper of the fishery, and he will **reset** the pond for you -- e.g., after you tell him that you want to continue fishing, you will see different fish in the pond. Use this trick to maximize the amount of points gained per fishing spree.
6. Reading the book in p.3 also shows you a target reticle when aiming the rod. Use it to put the lure close to the fish you want, but **not on top of it**. The best position is the direction the fish is facing presently. Also, if there is another large fish nearby that you don't want, wait for it to move further or use the dialogue trick above to reset the pond (better to wait, IMO, they don't move THAT slowly). When targeting the Guardian, don't worry about other fish taking his bait, he will be the only one who will go for the Suspicious Lure.
7. You can **buy a better rod for real money in the Sports Shop in Shibuya underground mall**, which gives you more leeway in terms of tilting the pointer on the fishing gauge (you can tilt it more times before the fish gets away). This rod also appears to make the pointer less likely to tilt, but please don't get too cocky, as misclicking the ""pull"" button on the Guardian will still almost always result in a loss of points in the bottom gauge, and it's really frustrating when it gets away...)

**Cheesing money in early game (but post-Kamoshida):**

1. Make sure to always check for the politician (Yoshida) near the Shibuya station exit. Search for him in the evenings near the Shibuya station after meeting him for the first time. Talk to him in the evening outside of active quests (the first time you'll see him, you'll be looking for something around the Shibuya station), tell him you're interested in politics. He will mention that he frequents a certain spot.
2. Get a flyer for Ore no Beko in Shibuya Underground pass. Work for them twice during evenings, preferably before any Sunday. Yoshida's questline only advances on Sundays (up to a certain point, which is irrelevant for what we need to do). During your second evening at Ore no Beko, Yoshida will ask you to help him with his speeches, thus unlocking the Sun confidant.
3. Always visit him in the evenings on Sunday. You will get Charm points as a side bonus, but, more importantly, on level 3 he will teach you to re-negotiate for money.
4. Once you have that skill and you're in a dungeon (mementos or a palace), look for Shadows that are weak to guns (Angel, Hea Po, Pixie, High Pixie, Mothman etc). To ease the process, make sure only one of these enemies is left standing (it doesn't matter, who is in the group with the mentioned enemy, just make sure that they are left alone in the end). **Don't use your guns during these fights!** Instead, when the enemy weak to guns is left alone, shoot them once, then demand money out of them multiple times (Yoshida just gave you this option at level 3). About 50% of the time the monster will summon 1 add to their aid. Get rid of the summon, rince and repeat. You will get hit like this, so make sure to have Morgana or Ann in your party to heal the damage (or use items). With this approach you will essentially be able to ask for money **as many times as the total number of shots available to your characters**. For that reason, I recommend not picking Ryuji for this approach, and taking Ann and Yusuke (for the last companion, Makoto is optimal, since she not only has 6 shots, but she can also heal). **You can also cast an accuracy buff (Masukukaja) on the party to make sure that your shots hit more often**.
5. You can do a similar trick with just about any enemy, to be honest. The idea is to **get them low on health so they beg for mercy**. If that happens, ask them for money multiple times. If they summon adds -- kill the monster that begged you (they will not beg again), and get the add to low health, rince and repeat. Use your spells, if they are low-cost and target the enemies' weaknesses. For this trick to bring you more money, make sure you are fighting 2+ enemies (and thus keep a healer in your party, preferably any two out of Makoto, Ann and Mona).
6. Unfortunately, by the end game you will start making progressively more money, and the amounts you make doing the above will be somewhat obsolete. Yet with the money buffer you earn this way, you can essentially set yourself up for early shopping / spending money on Kawakami / etc.

**Power spiking post-Futaba**

1. **If you start doing mementos before Futaba (the 4th palace), make sure to spend as many stamps as you gathered on the Money bonus. Get it as high as possible, and save up your stamps, until you max it out -- you won't lose stamps (unlike flowers) once you exit Mementos.**
2. **If possible, in Palaces you should capture any personas you meet at least once. Don't worry about keeping them.** You just need to **capture the persona, and substitute it for the most useless one**. You can always summon personas you registered in the Velvet Room. **Any persona gets registered automatically, once you capture it, but only if you DON'T delete it immediately**. This will fill up your registry, and you will get **discounts** for summoning at **25%, 50% and 75%!**
3. Once you get Futaba on your team, equip her with an S.E.E.S. Armband item (it's a DLC item, but you'll get it from your home chest, since Persona 5 Royal on Steam has all the DLC included anyway). That will boost the amount of money you get from encounters.
4. Get Ryuji to level 7 to unlock ""Insta-kill"". It will work only if you ""rush"" into enemies (holding the ""shift"" key), so Yoshizawa's ability might mess with it in Palaces; but you should be fine in Mementos -- just remember to always keep the ""shift"" key pressed while you travel there
5. This combo will shine in Mementos, but it works in Palaces too. In Mementos, enemies respawn, so you can quickly rack up the kills with your team.
6. Get Justine and Caroline to level 5 to unlock being able to fuse higher-level Personas. Fuse Garuda, get the Victory Cry ability. This ability will restore your SP (and HP) after a victory, making sure that at least Joker will always have spell points, in case you need to fight.
7. Once you get to know the Fortune-teller (Chihaya) in Shinjuku, get her to level 8 as soon as you can. Note: **to check your confidant status, go to your map menu, get the cursor over any area that has a blue card near it. Then press ""N"". If the blue card near your confidant of choice doesn't have the word ""UP!"" next to it, you won't level up your bond if you hang out with them like this.** Chihaya allows you to do an Affinity Reading at level 5, so if you get her to that level, always make sure to top up your confidants (even Chihaya herself, as you will need to pick dialogue options carefully with her) before hanging out with them. **When talking to Chihaya, try your best to have a Fortune Persona on you.**
8. At level 8, Chihaya will be able to do Celestial Readings. This will boost the amount of times you get Fusion Alarms. With these alarms you'd be able to Fuse stronger personas and transform them into stronger items. You can do all of this without Chihaya, but she makes the whole process somewhat easier.
9. Go to Mementos, go to the lowest level available to you at the moment. Go one story up. Clear the level until you get a Fusion alarm. Go back down on the lowest level, fast travel to the entrance. Go inside the Velvet Room and fuse personas or itemize them. **Never itemize the persona that you fused during the alarm, as it will very likely fail.** Don't be too greedy with this. Once you are done with the Velvet room, go back to the lowest level, rince and repeat. **Just remember to hold the ""shift"" key while you explore Mementos**. You can also sell most of the sooty equipment you get to the second hand, as you will be able to get better gear from itemized personas anyway. Also, the more enemies you insta-kill in Mementos, the more gold you get.
10. To optimize this process, focus first on completing Justine's and Caroline's questline first (you can do it even without the Fusion Alarm). Just remember that Level 9 of their questline requires you to **complete a mementos request** with a jealous girl, and Level 10 requires you to have a **High Counter skill card**. To get this skill card, fuse the **Ose** persona (use this calculator for help: [https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5\_calculator/indexRoyal.html#/persona/Ose](https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5_calculator/indexRoyal.html#/persona/Ose) ), and itemize it during a Fusion Alarm. Once you hit level 10, buying higher level personas will be cheaper.
11. **To further optimize, focus all your money on getting Justine's and Caroline's quest completed before doing anything on this list**. The quality of the personas you fuse doesn't matter, as long as they get the required skill, and it's really only the level 9 that's gated. Their questline also **doesn't require spending time.**

Other notes:

1. This is a controversial opinion, and some people don't like doing that, but please use the Camera Strap item on your party. You will ambush your enemies for 90% of the time, if you play your cards right, and it's the best item to restore your SP.
2. Don't rush Takemi if you do (1). She does give you Guts as a side bonus, but still, you can de-prioritize her in favor of Ryuji / Chihaya / Yoshida. She is also available to hang out with very often, so don't worry about missing out on her.
3. Prioritize Kawakami, and don't forget to use her every time her services become available (considering you got a money buffer using the trick we described above). **Make sure to have Sojiro at least at level 3 or 4 to unlock Coffee and Curry**, so that she can do that for you, while you do something else. **Don't focus on reading books that much, as Kawakami's ""Slacking off"" bonus will help you with that (but it doesn't trigger as often, unfortunately).**
4. Read mostly on the train, keep books handy. On **July, 1** go to the library and pick up **Speed Reading**, and read that at your earliest convenience. It will make sure you read most of the books in one sitting.
5. **Always use Chihaya's Luck Reading if you are not boosting Affinities, and you know you will be upgrading a stat** (e.g. boosting Yoshida, Sojiro, Shiya, Ohya, Hifumi, Iwai or working somewhere, or studying, or reading books or doing... any kind of activity that you know brings you points. Considering the money buffer we mentioned above, you should not worry about the cost of this procedure.

That's something I gathered for myself during my first run of the game.

Tues and Wed feel okay to function but Wednesday, Thursday and Friday glucose is all over the place around 120ish spikes of 160s, 170s just drinking coffee or pepsi zero. Anyone else seeing a pattern like this? I have a strict diet no sugar or carbs.

1i2bqre,https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/comments/1i2bqre/help_with_new_name_for_rabbit_baby/,Help with (new) name for rabbit baby ,"Hi, namenerds!

I need help with a name for a female, 3 month old rabbit. She is the single survivor out of 6 kits that their mother (who I took in as a pregnant rescue) did not care for.

She is cinnamon brown, lop rabbit mix. Very loving (giving lots of kisses) but also a bit sassy. She is curious and brave even though she is nearly blind. 

Originally I named her Arla. Because she outright refused to touch the kitten formula I had bought for her (there is no rabbit specific formula so this is what is recommended).

The only thing she would drink was coffee creamer. The name of the manufacturer of that coffee creamer is Arla. A big dairy group in my country.

But people will not stop with the puns. Calling her ""Yoghurt"" ""Kefir"" and ""Lurpak"" (Danish butter brand).

I'm getting tired of it.

I have 4 other rabbits:

Archie, Barney,James and Albertine (the latter being the mother of the baby).

I prefer classical names, nothing too modern. I prefer human names over pet names.

She can't be called:

Karla -an ex has a kid by that name.

Matilda and Caroline as both are names associated with food brands in my country.

Luna: Name of a family member.

Hi everyone,

I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

1i2bjmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i2bjmq/the_front_porch_light/,The Front Porch Light,"I woke up sweaty and in a daze. Most nights this is normal for me but not tonight.

Something about my bedroom was odd, something wasn’t right. I felt around next to me and grabbed my phone and checked the time – it’s midnight. Seven more hours of sleep before I gotta get up and get ready for work. I looked over to the open door and saw the faint yellow porch light that emanates through our cheap and slightly cracked blinds next to the front door. 

I dropped my phone back to its place and lay my head back down, letting out a heavy sigh and turning to my wife who’s sleeping soundly next to me, her back facing me. I gently run my fingers down her spine for comfort and try to get my sleep going once more. 

I woke up sweaty and in a daze again.

I felt a cough coming in and did my best to suppress it so as to not wake up my wife, but the dryness of my throat made it difficult. I stood and walked through the open door and into the kitchen. I didn’t bother to turn on any of the lights as the porch lights were enough to illuminate my way. Our apartment was small, only two bedrooms and one bath big and without having any children of our own, it was easy to navigate with my adjusted eyes. 

I grabbed a cup from the cabinet and poured myself some water. As I poured and listened to the sound of my cup being filled, I suddenly realized that the entire apartment was quiet. I stopped pouring and looked over to the window next to the front door. The light still penetrated through but a sense of suspicion all but forced me to take a peek through the blinds. 

I walked over and lifted a single blind. It was foggy. The cars normally parked out in front were invisible and I couldn’t make out a single thing except for some black asphalt maybe ten feet ahead. This fog was dense and looked stained from the porch’s light. 

I let the single blind drop back to its place and turned to the kitchen again. I took two steps when I saw a part of the light that shone on the floor be disturbed. Something ran past. Something I didn’t see or notice earlier. A single black line now broke the even light, and it was clearly standing still now. 

I turned again and with my adrenaline now running I slowly but shakily check the doorknob and top lock, making sure they’re both secure. I stood still now as well, hoping that whatever stood behind my door left or at least gave me the ease of knowing that it’s actually something mundane. 

A minute passes and nothing changes. My eyes were still locked onto the black shadow on the floor and with keeping my peripheral vision on the window, I slowly and quietly went back into the room. At this point I had so much fear of breaking eye contact with the shadow, but I didn’t know what to do. 

I sat on the edge of my bed that gave me a perfect view of the shadow on the floor and used my left hand to reach over and feel for my wife. Thankfully she’s still asleep. 

I sat and watched for a long time. I don’t actually know how much time had passed but it was enough to tire me. My eyes were burning and each blink reminded me that I wasn’t going to last much longer like this. 

Blink. 

Yawn. 

Blink.

I woke up sweaty and dazed. 

I immediately threw myself to my feet and looked around. My heart was beating fast and saw that the shadow on the floor was gone. I looked over to my wife and there she was, still asleep, peaceful and beautiful. 

I managed to get my heart rate down by breathing and thinking to myself how vivid and strange that nightmare was. I sat back on the bed and felt around for my phone and checked the time – it’s midnight. 

That can’t be right. Was it daylight savings? 

My throat was still dry, so I decided to grab some water from the kitchen. I passed the yellow light again and saw the same cup of water I had forgotten about in my nightmare sitting right there on the counter. Exactly where I had left it. 

Dread now washed over me and I began to sweat even more than I already was. Am I still in my nightmare? No, the sweat beading down my cheek and my irritating dry throat felt too real. If that’s the case…

I closed my eyes shut and tightly held them together while my mind raced. This means that whatever stood on my front porch was probably still there. I didn’t want to open them and see its shadowy presence on the floor. Yet, if this is real, I need to make sure my wife is safe. 

I took a deep breath in and opened them. No shadow. 

I let my breath go and made my way back to the bedroom. I crawled onto bed and shook my wife’s shoulder and whispered her name. She didn’t respond. She had always been a heavy sleeper so it was gonna take a little more than that, but I also didn’t want to scare her awake either.

On my second attempt I heard knocking. It was faint but clear. I felt my heart drop and I closed my eyes again, leaving my hand hovering over my wife. 

Then it spoke.

“Hello? Is anyone home?”

The voice was feminine. It spoke with emotion, like a scared person asking if the killer was hiding in the basement in a horror movie. 

The words echoed throughout the apartment. I turned and slowly made my way back to the front door. If it wasn’t a nightmare then I know the locks are secure; yet the dread of doubting myself won and I started shaking with fear. 

I looked over to the lit floor and didn’t see the shadowy line that previously split the light. Instead, it was much smaller and contained itself to the top portion of the lit floor. I took some more deep breaths and calmed myself enough to say fuck it and check what was looming right outside my door. 

What I saw made no sense. 

Outside, where the dense fog remained, right on the edge of the black asphalt where my visibility ended, was a nude female body. It stood still and the porch light gave just enough to see that it was missing its head. 

I took a step back and made quite a bit of noise when I accidentally kicked the coffee table that was nearby. My breathing became more intense and I now had a piercing headache, but I took another look to see if it wasn’t a mannequin. It wasn’t.

I could see that there were dark streaks running down its breasts and down its naval. It looked like it stood perfectly still but noticed that it swayed ever so slightly.

While examining it I tried to see if there was anything else out there that could make sense of what I was seeing but there was nothing. 

Before dropping the blind, I heard very low humming. This was something I hadn’t noticed before – was it there the whole time? Or did it just now start? I scanned the surroundings again and when I looked further up I saw its head.

It was floating right above me, inches away from my front door and facing it. The mouth was agape and the eyes missing. Its hair flowed down and where the neck ends were the same black streaks as the body. 

I was frozen in place. Was this what was bothering me the whole time? Staring right at the floating head it began to speak again. 

“Hello? Could you come outside please?” 

No part of the head moved. Not even its mouth.

At this point I didn’t care anymore. I ran back to the bed and shook my wife, yelling her name. I shook and I shook but there she remained, sleeping peacefully. I grabbed her by the chin and turned her to face me, she looked fine and was still breathing like normal. Good, at least I didn’t ha-

BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG.

The sounds of the violent knocking rattled my headache again and I clasped my ears. I jumped out of bed and ran towards the window. I opened up the blinds wider and less inconspicuous this time to get a better look and saw that the feverishly stained fog had rolled back a little, along with a fleet of headless bodies. Instead of the single one they were now numerous. They varied in shapes and sizes and some clearly darker than others. Some stood on the ground and others floated above, some closer and some farther, some lower and some higher. They surrounded me in my now god-forsaken apartment. 

The floating head remained alone, still facing my front door. I stared at it and waited for it to do something. Soon, it started viciously slamming itself against the door then speaking again.

BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG.

""Hello? Can you please come outside? Please?”

BANG. BANG. BANG.

This time it came from behind me. I quickly turned and saw a figure standing outside my bedroom window, right next to where I sleep. Running towards the window I realized that there was a yellowish light that shone outside, same as the front porch. I stopped and checked the spare room – same light outside. Looking through the spare room window I saw a dark-skinned body floating, stiff as a board but floating, slowly and eerily towards the window. 

I ran back to my bedroom and my heart stopped for a second. Looking upon the bed I saw that my wife was missing. I cried and shouted for her name but received no answer. I ran through the apartment, but she wasn’t there. 

I sat on the bed and cried. I smacked my head a couple times out of frustration when the violent knocking came back again. This time it came from every window in the apartment. Every. Single. One.

I screamed and covered my ears and shut my eyes tightly to try and drown out the horrifying sounds. 

Then I heard my wife.

“Babe? Hello?”

I opened my eyes and looked up, but I didn’t see her.

“Babe, you sound distressed. Why don’t you come outside?”

Sadly, the last 2.5 months have not been enjoyable. The opening and closing/locking of the lid sucks, compared to the automated Plus. If you aren’t precise with closing the lid, the whole machine vibrates violently while brewing. It doesn’t happen often but when it does, my cat and dog run for their lives due to the noise. The coffee tastes the same but the amount of “crema” produced is crazy compared to the Plus.

We live in the same city but in separate apartments. We have a great relationship and she is the best serious romantic partner that I’ve ever had. I can even see us eventually progressing towards marriage in 3-5 years time. 

That said, over the past year of dating, she has informed me she has remained close friends with 3 of her past sexual partners Drake (32M), Matt (31M) and Travis (30M), none of whom live in the same area we do.

Unfortunately for me, I feel that the way she remains in touch with her past partners (now just friends) gives me cold feet from time to time. We have talked about the way that this bothers me on multiple occasions before and we continue to revisit this topic time to time. But every time we revisit this topic, I still can’t seem to get past these feelings of cold feet.

I myself follow the mantra that once I am in a committed relationship with a partner, I start to phase out people that I have had romantic connections with (both long and short term ones) from my past out of my life. Essentially I transition them from being my close friends to being more of acquaintances or even stop talking to them altogether to focus my sole “romantic type” energy on my current partner. 

I want to clarify that I don’t mind that she has slept with people before we met. We both are adults and have numerous sexual partners. What does bother me is the fact that she would periodically sleep with these friends of hers over the years when in between relationships (and within the past 2 years) but still wants to have them in her close friends network.

I personally don’t believe that’s enough time for you to flush out any romantic feelings out of your system for somebody. And given she has at least hooked up with these people over the the course of multiple years, it gives an underlying feeling that if her and I were to ever break up again, if any of these specific friends were single again, there would be no reason they couldn’t/wouldn’t sleep together again.

I do have both male and female friends, and believe people should be free to be friends with any gender. But they are not people that I have had romantic pasts with. This is regardless of if the relationships ended in either good or bad terms.

I also want to iterate that I strive to not be controlling type and let my gf know she is free to do as she pleases, but I do try to let her know that I have certain boundaries of comfort, and should she do something that oversteps these, I may end up feeling a certain way about it.

Now getting back to my relationship with Samantha, I really appreciate that she has been open with me with regard to who these people are. She has told me about when they met (all of them about 4 years ago), how they met (all of them off of dating sites), and gives me updates from time to time about their own lives. She’ll tell me things like if they are dating anybody currently, if they want to visit, if they’re in town currently, and etc. it shows she is open with me about them, and that there is nothing to hide. She will often show snippets of their conversations out of her own volition as well. Side note, I have never snooped through her phone as I trust her, and also bc that’s a disgusting behavior.

But I have different levels of concern/comfort for each respective friend of hers. 

Drake:

One of her friends Drake (32M), I have met in person once before when visiting one of the past places Samantha used to live. I will admit that he was pretty cool. At the time he was seeing someone so it was more like a double date. He is the only one of her friends I could see myself wanting to hang out with as a friend based on shared interests. It only slightly bothers me that she remains in touch with him, but I’m okay to overlook this specific friend. Another important detail to know is that Samantha told Drake about me after our first date, and I gave extra respect for their friendship after finding out about this.

However, the other two of her friends Matt (31M) and Travis (30M) are the ones that I have had more mental issues with.

Matt: 

Her ex boyfriend Matt (31M) was the one that I had the most hesitations with initially. When I found out he was the last person that my gf seriously dated before we met, and had slept with her weeks before we met, that was unsettling for me to hear given she was still talking to him months into our relationship. They had initially been fwb, then dated for a few months beginning about a year before we met, but continued casually hooking up after they broke up until we met. I suspected that she was not completely over him when they originally split and when we first started dating. 

When Samantha and I originally became exclusive, she told most of her friends that she was seeing me, but she took at least 3-5 months to directly mention that she was seeing me to her friend Matt. We have talked about this and I have discussed how this hurt me. She had apologized for that. I had asked that she cut this person out of her life and she was at first not on board with this idea. She eventually agreed to tell him that he needs to stop liking her social media posts and limit her interactions with him to create a sense of space between them so I would feel more comfortable. 

That said, she found out Matt was in town recently from a mutual friend of hers and my GF asked if I wanted to hang out with him on New Year’s Eve with their other mutual friends that were in town. I had remained firm that I was not interested in that idea. I told her that she can do whatever she wants to do, and that I would rather it just be us on NYE together as it approached midnight. 

She then suggested she might grab a coffee or a drink with him instead beforehand, but I told her that if she met up in person with them before our plans for the night that would still make me feel uneasy. I could tell that she was sad with what I had said, but they didn’t end up hanging out. I held my ground that I think it’s still too soon to want to hang out with this person given what I know about them. I was also under the impression that she was going to completely cut out this person from her life, but found out they still stalk each other’s social medias and text occasionally. I find this kind of weird, and it gave me cold feet for a week. I think this is behind us for now at least, but I feel like it’s only going to be a matter of time before he comes back into town and she’ll want to meet up in person again, which I feel uneasy about.

Travis:

She communicates with Travis (32M) the most out of all of these 3 friends. He lives a couple time zones away on the other side of the country. It seems like they are in communication with each other essentially every day. When we are together she will sometimes show me snippets of their conversations. On the surface, it seems pretty innocent, but a part of me also thinks that he is specifically keeping her around in his back pocket. Many times it’s him bombarding her with many small updates about his day to day life. Like the quantity of updates you would only reserve for your partner.

Whether it be pictures of his pets or anything that’s going on at the moment. They seem to heart react to a fair amount of the text messages back and forth to each other. They also send each other memes more often to each other than she does with me. I feel like I don’t understand their entire dynamic. 

I can’t remember the last time that I would message a platonic friend of mine this often, and it weirded me out because I feel like it takes away a part of her emotional availability for me when she expenses it with him talking back-and-forth as much as they do. She doesn’t really text as much as it is, and I often feel jealous like he is stealing her emotional bandwidth from me sometimes. She insists they’re only platonic friends now.

Even though they live on separate sides of the country, they seem to make plans to visit each other in person every once in a while.

When Samantha and I were first dating, she made plans to visit him in his city, but only told me a week before she left that they had a romantic past together for a short period of time. Granted this is a month into our relationship, and we were driving to our first romantic weekend getaway trip together, I felt was in no position to tell her she couldn’t do this regardless on if I felt comfortable or not with it. I felt kind of played by the timing of her announcement, and could’ve portrayed my actual level of comfort with this idea better if it was more open with their past when she initially planned to visit him a month prior. 

I decided to “Play It cool” and be OK with her visiting her friend for a few days one on one. I do trust that nothing happened sexually between them during this trip, and she stayed on an air mattress in a separate room and we FaceTimed each night while she was there.

That said, she just told me last week that he is going to be visiting our town over the weekend in two weeks. I have no idea of when she knew he would be visiting, so I can’t say if they have already made solid plans, but it seems to be that way. 

She said she offered to let him stay at her apartment on a couch in a separate room while she was to stay in her in her bedroom, but also said that she could stay at my place while he is in town and offer him her bedroom at her place instead. Of course, I would prefer the later, but the way that she brought this up made me seem like she had already discussed this with him and told him it is OK for him to stay at her place.

Given we have been dating for a year now, I would’ve hoped by now that if something like this comes up, she would first consult me see if I have any reservations about it, but that is not what happened here. 

I want to bring up to her that I wish she would have brought this to my attention first instead of making all these plans already. But that said, I again feel trapped by the timing of this and feel like no matter what, I will be the bad guy here if I tell her I don’t want him coming to stay at her place.

I want to bring it up to her, but I also don’t want to make it seem like I am demanding for her to get permission and that I am “allowing” her to let a friend stay at her place for which she pays rent for. This just seems like a controlling way to approach it, and I simply want to demonstrate that I am uncomfortable with her making these types of plans given sensitivities I have with these specific friends, and especially given these types of rushed timelines for me to speak my true feelings.

Does this mean she gets to visit him one on one again this year? Does this mean he automatically gets to barge into our lives and stay for free at our place once we move in together? There’s just lots of scenarios/behaviours I want to nip in the bud before they become auto-approved in the future, but don’t know how to bring it up. 


What is your advice here on how to bring this up to her? Do I tell her that her friend can stay at her place and just be passive aggressive about it for months to come, or do I tell her I’d rather he stay at a hotel, and then risk having her/her friend friend dislike me for this? 

Given I have met one of her friends in the past, do I meet this other guy too? 

I know the typical r/relationship_advice comments tend to be something like “just break up with her and find someone else”, but I would hate to ruin something I think is really special over some type of jealousy hang up I have. Certainly we would be able to work through this I would imagine right?

I guess another thing I’m curious about is why does she have to be friends with these specific people? Why do her closest friends need to be some guys she has slept with? Is it something along the lines of she just likes the extra male attention she gets? Is that some form of narcissism?

Idk I just get worried that I will never be enough potentially of that she might end up sort of emotionally cheating on me with some of these male friends of hers.

Sorry it’s a lot to read. But What are your thoughts on how I should bring up these concerns of mine to her?",3,1736984963.0,relationship_advice,13,0.71,False

We are both supervisor in a company that we are going to get sponsor from , it’s been challenging  working there for 4 years , 12 h/shift 6 on/1 off different as my partner as he want to get AMMAP. I learn that he cheated on me after a year of relationship so I have been struggling with trust issue a lot. 
Anyway 4 month ago a girl came to work in our company, kind and everything.  David has been different since she arrived  going to break with her , going to her desk to talk with her a lot ect . I try to be friendly with the girl but she doesn’t seems interested by me…
We had a talk with D and he Guaranteed that they were nothing except friendship , she is someone he can talk to a lot , teaches him Spanish ect. A lot of thing happened  after like some whispers from other like  something was off.  Anyway the girl left , they kept in touch time to time , but it was more my partner that were texting her she would not answer for few days ect. We were still working hard  same as usual and my partner decided to ask her out for a coffee as he was supposed to go grocery during is only day off by himself as we have different days off  , I talk to him about it  and he said that it’s not like it’s going there to see her , he is going to do grocery and catch up with a friend. All my guts is telling me that’s something is up. So I took an extra day off and  stay at home  as we didn’t have time for our relationship as we work too much to catch up with us.She said that she was sick  so couldn’t come. We did grocery and went back home , no coffee for me apparently. D got a tight wallet always have, he needs all the time a good reason to  go to restaurants or buy flowers only for me apparently.

1i2bfye,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1i2bfye/third_wave_shop_review_address_coffee_co_st/,"Third Wave Shop Review:   Address Coffee Co.   - St. Augustine, FL","On Monday I was tipped off to a new 3rd Wave shop in St. Augustine by Adam at Bold Bean Jax Beach.   I made the trip down yesterday to check it out.   And it was by far way more than I expected.  It is definitely a 3rd wave drinker's shop - not just a coffee shop serving pourover because it's the thing to do.

According to the owner he said that opened up just 2.5 months ago.  You'd never know from the experience I had.

I had their a light roast Colombian they had from Passenger Coffee (Lancaster PA).  It was as described by the baristas, light, bright, juicy.

Their brew ratio:   24g C to 405g of water.   16.8 ratio.

Baristas were outstanding, knowledgeable on the coffees, definitely invested in coffee.  The shop utilizes the NextLevel Pulsar Brewer and the presentation is superb -on a small tray.

The style of shop is very modern, clean, white, bright, with amber wood accents and a decent amount of seating considering the size of the space.  They offer an outdoor shared seating space on the right side of the building.  Their back room seating has 2 large sofas and a few more tables and chairs.

Andrew who owns and runs the shop is a great conversation and loved sharing recipes, gear talk, and discussion about the heavy hitters in coffee.  From what he told me, he started out at Blue Bottle and worked in the Bay area in coffee originally.   He was kind enough to give me the last 20 g of a Passenger reserve coffee they had and I returned the favor with a dose of Friedhats Gesha Clouds I had with me in my truck.

Other:

They offer wines, beers on tap, a really good lemon soda they brew up, sparkling water as well.   They had bags of coffee for sale - Passenger and Subtext.   They have some coffee gear - they sell the Pulsar brewer.

Food:  They have a small menu of food options, bakery, and I believe they do some of their own baking there as well.   They have cheese plates and that sort of thing as well.

Hours:  7am to 4pm

From I-95 you're about a 10 minute drive to the shop so it's very convenient if you're just passing through.

Overall, I would say this shop was in my top 5 of all time I've visited for experience, service, and just plain enjoymnent.    They offer WiFi if you're looking to set up a laptop but don't do it at the bar top ;-)

1i2bfgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/JBL/comments/1i2bfgs/auto_turnon_how_to_disable/,Auto Turn-On - How to Disable,"We have a JBL 2.1 Soundbar (with the 10 inch sub) that is hooked up to our Samsung TV with an optical cable only.  We usually use the soundbar for movies and occasional streaming on some evenings, but we REALLY don't want it on with the OTA local news station at 5:00 am when we're quietly having our coffee.  The soundbar appears to have other intentions since it comes on every single time we turn on the TV and blasts us with heavy bass and high frequency noise.

I've called JBL's tech line several times and asked if there's any way to disable the automatic turn-on ""feature"", but they keep referring back to CEC.  They seem to be at a loss with optical (even though it's a function of the sound at itself), and always suggest hooking it up via HDMI ARC.  I do this, and instead of it turning on every single time the TV is turned on, it turns on ~ every OTHER random time it decides to even though CEC settings are disabled on the TV.

I'm at a loss at this point, and would just like to know if there's a way to disable the automatic turn-on ""feature"" via the soundbar itself. Never had a soundbar that can't be fully turned off.  Does anyone have any experience with this? Thanks very much in advance.",0,1736984867.0,JBL,0,0.5,False

I used to like it back then because the story was angsty and the person who wrote it used a lot of really cool songs on the background.

I don't really remember the plot, but the MC worked in a coffee shop and Yoongi used to go there to write his songs, I believe it was kind of a pre-debut story because at some point he starts having concerts......sadly I don't remember anything else, but if anyone does please let me know :) I would love to revisit it, if it still exists somewhere.

Dive into the shadowy, gear-grinding world of Revengate, a roguelike RPG set in a steampunk-infused Lyon! As an investigator for the enigmatic Lux Co., you'll unravel dark mysteries in an alternate 19th century brimming with [Victorian technology and arcane magic](https://revengate.org/img/revengate-demo-v0.11.webm).

The game is rendered using a mix of tiles, ascii, and unicode glyphs. There is also a sprinkle of OpenGL shaders for more [striking visual effects](https://ygingras.net/rev-devlog/summoning.webm). With a focus on mobile friendly controls, the game runs on Android and in the browser.

In Revengate, every boon carries a burden. The reinvigorating potion of booze will boost your health regeneration, but it also takes a toll on your agility. The potion of analysis-paralysis will unlock perfect perception, but you are bound to your location. And absinthe… well, some doors are best left unopened.

Best of all? It's completely free, open-source, with no ads or microtransactions, and you can even play offline!

## Lessons and Triumphs of 2024

This was a good year and I feel like the game got significancy better. The biggest improvements were:

*   **Secrets revealed!** Cheat codes are now public! Unleash hidden powers and explore the game in new ways.
*   **A new quest awaits!** Help a troupe of traveling [Pacherrs](https://gitlab.com/ygingras/revengate/-/raw/main/src/monsters/pacherr.jpg?ref_type=heads&inline=true) find magical crystals!
*   **Performance BOOST!** Experience [smoother gameplay](https://ygingras.net/rev-devlog/crowding-improvement.webm) and optimized performance. I had fun times exploring with the Godot profiler.
*   **Optimized memory!** Only the active level stays loaded.
*   **Whispers of the future...** Godot, the very engine of the game has been upgraded to 4.3. This required some non-trivial changes, but it allows web exports to run smoothly on Apple devices.
*   **New items galore!** Fuel your adventures with the Potion of Coffee, gain new perspectives with Eye Glasses, try your luck with the Potion of Snake Oil, and stay sharp with the Talisman of Sobriety.
*   **Beware the depths!** A new monstrous threat lurks in the sewers: the Sewer Alligator!
*   **Unleash magical fury!** Your character can now wield spells! Prepare for devastating new tactics and strategies.

More minor, but still makes the game better:

*   **Prepare for the horde!** Monsters now crowd together, creating intense and challenging encounters.
*   **Become a master of movement!** Holding down those arrow keys now keeps you flowing through the world. No more stop-start frustration!
*   **Pinch to perfection!** Enhanced pinching controls for a more intuitive experience.
*   **Deeper conversations!** NPCs have more to say! Uncover richer lore and engaging dialogue.
*   **See where you are going** See your travel path clearly highlighted.
*   **Explore new dimensions!** Non-rectangular rooms add exciting new architectural variety.
*   **Full rest!** Long press ""wait"" to fully recover, but your attention drops while your focus is on your wounds.
*   **Dynamic highlights!** Possibly action now enjoy a whole rainbow of colours and shades thanks to dynamic ""scene tiles"", which are more flexible than atlas (sprite sheet) tiles.
*   **Declutter!** Duplicate log entries are now merged for a cleaner and more concise view.
*   **See everything!** Conditions are [now visible](https://ygingras.net/rev-devlog/inspectable-buffs.webm) in the inspect screen.
*   **See what you see!** The vision range is now animated, so you get a better sense of when you've had one drink too many.

There were also some dead ends. I played with glow and dynamic lighting, but according to player reports, those do not run smooth at all on older phones so I ended up having to gate them behind settings and not build any mechanics that would rely on them.

I was less active on the weekly RoguelikeDev threads while doing a social media fast. It really helped me regain some focus. I even experimented coding on a machine that is not on the internet. This felt surprisingly good. The best solution is probably a solid timebox where I give myself several hours of focus each morning and then use the afternoons for things that like research that works better with online access. The trick is to make it hard to check, so the ""airplane mode"" icon in the wifi config does not seem like a good enough solution. I might be ready to start using social media again slowly.

## 2025 Direction

My main goals for this coming year are:

* New platforms
* More item synergy
* Better ranged combat
* New monsters
* Play with pure tiles

Flathub seems like a logical place to publish an open-source game, but reading the other devlogs here, I feel like it's Steam that brings more players.

The new Talisman of Sobriety transforms a range of so-so alcoholic drinks into a very useful items. I want to come up with more such combinations.

I am very aware that there are way too make taps needed to toss anything. The next version with less you quiver stuff into hot-slots and get one-tap-toss buttons for those, a bit like Shattered Pixels Dungeon, which is a really good use of the space on a tiny mobile screen.

I love writing the description and backstories of monsters. I don't love working on art commissions, but I'm usually delighted by the end result, so I should do more of that.

Dwarf Fortress and many others have reported considerable increase in accessibility when they when with a tiled gameplay. It terms of code, that's really easy given where I am. The biggest hit is going to be with the art budget, but there is probably some in between to be found with public tile sets (like the DCSS one) and AI temp art for lesser monsters.

# Minute Maze

I factored out the Revengate maze generation code into mini game: [Minute Maze](https://ygingras.itch.io/minute-maze). This adrenaline-pumping sprint lets you solve mini maze puzzles while the clock is ticking fast! Each game is under 90 seconds, with very simple controls.

This was an attempt to get better at prototyping. It also gave me a tiny code sandbox that was perfect to experiment with things like the Godot scene tiles.

I really like how it feels on the desktop, but I'm not quite happy with the mobile controls. Or rather, I like the mobile controls, but half the play testers seem to struggle with them for at least 5 mins. Given how short the game is, that's unacceptable. I will try a few different schemes, and if I get d-pad style controls to feel really good, maybe I will backport those into Revengate. Otherwise this one is probably done, but I do want to do more small game prototypes in 2025.

That's it for, I wish you all a new year full of enlightening and fulfilling game development.

**Sean woke up from his coma after four months with an insatiable hunger for food. The first thing out of his mouth to the nurse was “french fries”. He was forty-two years old and he was awake. It was a car collision that involved him and another fellow. He had run a red light during the wee hours of the night on a busy city street, crashing into the other man on the passenger side, not harming him. The unfortunate part was that he was left paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his natural life. He had been awake for four days by the time he had gotten any visits while in the hospital.**

**He was sitting up eating a bowl of ice cream and looking down at his legs.**

**“So, for now, you’re going to be staying at an assisted living home. Because the accident was ruled as your fault, your insurance isn’t compensating for the accident. You will be relying on the government disability act until or if you even can go back to work. Get it?”**

**“I get it. I’m a bum now until I show them I can still handle work requirements. Simply put, I’m fucked. I can’t operate the machinery at the plant anymore, so I’ll be waiting for a monthly payoff of peanuts for the rest of my shitty life. I get it, Mark. Who sent you anyway?”**

**“John did because he knows you’re my brother-in-law so he figured…”**

**“He figured he could pass the job of telling me to you.** 

**“I guess.”**

**“Well, it’s done then. Thanks for coming by.”**

**“No problem. The doctor said that you’ll be okay to leave after they’ve rendered you capable.”**

**“Cool. I hate this hospital. The only thing that’s good about this place is the desserts. The nurses here are dogs. Have you seen them? They're a bunch of mutts.”**

**“Sean, leave it to you to say something vulgar like that.”**

**“Hey, nothing's wrong with my libido, brother.”**

**“So, do you need anything else?”**

**“Ya, get me some Mars bars from the Canteen, will ya?”**

**“Done deal. Then I have to leave. Busy weekend for us, you know how it is.”**

**“No, I don’t but I am sympathetic to you. Spend time with my sister and be good to her, eh?”**

**“Always, Sean.”**

**When Sean was finally alone, he had time to contemplate just what had occurred. All he could remember about the accident was leaving the bar. He had been drinking at Al’s all evening hitting on a woman who frequented there often but would never give in to his advances. Lee was her name and she always played hard to get with Sean. On the evenings that they would run into each other, she would ask him to play a game of pool with her, always accepting the drink he would offer to buy. Vodka and seven on ice was her drink and he never got it wrong. He would let her win every game, being as pleasant as he could in his efforts to lay her. She was his type and he just loved the way she laughed. But she was a player and the method to her madness was to get free drinks from the bachelors. It worked quite well for her when she stuck to the dive bars around town.**

**On those nights, including the night of the crash, he would leave the bar alone. And that is all he remembered about that night, drinking and playing pool with Lee, getting cut off for the night by the bartender, and getting in his car to drive home. The accident itself failed to be conscious in his mind.**

**Sean kept trying to jog his memory of that night but nothing ever stood out as a clear memory. It all fell into place as just another night at the bar in his mind and nothing more.**

**But he knew that this wasn’t the case as he tried to move his legs at all. The injuries that he took away from the accident were a broken left wrist, a broken neck, some minor cuts and bruises, and a chipped tooth. When he spoke to the doctor, he said that they were hoping in time that he may regain some of the feelings in his legs but he would never walk again. Every time he thought about this he got depressed, staying with him the whole time he was in the hospital.**

**On discharge day, he was so revved up to get going, that he couldn’t keep his hands still. He would use the phone, then flick the channels on the television, or scribble notes on paper that were relatively meaningless.**

**Anything to keep him occupied.**

**“Mr. Vader, are you ready to leave? Have they given you your belongings yet?”**

**“I think so. Yes. I am geeked to get out of here, that’s for sure”**

**“Good. The chair is yours until you get your real chair. I’ll wheel you downstairs where there will be a cab coming for you soon. All set?”**

**“I guess,” Sean said listlessly.**

**The cab was already waiting there by the time they got to the entrance. He was helped in and quickly dropped off at the Helping Hands Assisted Living Institution on the other side of the city. The occupational nurse at the hospital showed Sean how to leverage his weight and get himself in and out of the chair to do practical duties. He was still very new to it, so it took him time to get from one position to the next.**

**He sat in front of the home taking it in that he was dependent on others from now on to get around and perform certain tasks. Sean wasn’t the type to rely on people, so it was very difficult for him to accept this fate. He took a mental image of the building and pushed his way through the door and to the front desk.**

**Right away, he was greeted by a nurse in a loose-fitting uniform, who introduced herself as Patricia. They exchanged greetings, and he was shown to his room. He would remember her name by relating it to her toothy smile. He liked her right away and told himself to ask her if he ever needed anything.**

**He sat in the wheelchair, staring around the room at his shared situation. The room consisted of two beds, two dressers, two end tables, and a television mounted on the wall. His bed was located beside the window labeled on the headboard as “205B. 205A was empty it seemed so for the time being he had the room to himself. All in all the room was pleasant with two very large paintings of scenery and wall-to-wall carpeting in burgundy to add to the decor.** 

**Sean wheeled around the room, taking it all in, noticing the central air and ensuite bathroom. About five minutes into this the loudspeaker from the hall went off with a voice from administration.**

**“To all residents… dinner will be served at four-thirty pm. Please feel free to utilize our coffee and tea service. Thanks.”**

**Sean checked his watch which said four-twelve pm. That gave him time to wheel himself to the elevator and discover the dining room on the first floor. He could feel his arms burning from the weight as he approached the elevator. Just as he was arriving at the doors, they opened. He saw it was Patricia again but he froze in shock when she exited the doors. Her face was a mess of decay and rot, her cheeks hanging and her teeth exposed. One of her eyes was missing and she had no tongue. She tried to say something to him but it only came out as a garbled retching at him. He yelped and pushed himself back in terror. She walked right by him and turned her face away. For a moment he just sat there, and when he turned himself around to look once again, she was normal. Her face wasn’t grotesque anymore. She smiled at him with a fresh face, eyes bright and cheery. He forced a small back and got himself on the elevator, completely indifferent to what had just happened.**

**He was breathing heavily as the elevator took him from the second floor to the first, unable to process what he had just seen.**

**“You’re hallucinating now too buddy. Get a grip. It’s probably one of my medications that’s doing this to me.”**

**Once out of the noisy elevator, he entered the large cafeteria-style area where people were lined up to two servers that doled out food at the back of the room. Sean took his place at the back of the line and waited his turn. There were about fourteen people ahead of him and he figured it would be awhile before he set down to eat. He fixed his gaze on everyone already seated. There were all different types of characters eating their meals at the tables. He was eager to see what kind of food they served at the establishment he was now a part of.**

**He started to think about Patricia and how her face had changed. He just couldn’t figure out how his mind could trick him like that. When it was his turn to pick out his food he was impressed. He had choices of two different dishes and he picked the pasta and salad for himself, along with a glass of milk and coffee. They even had a fruit cup for dessert but he passed it by. He sat down at a table where there was only one other person seated. It was a man in his forties who looked rather thin and sinewy in appearance. He had a five o’clock shadow and no front teeth to chew with. Every time he closed his jaw to chew it looked as though half of his face disappeared. Sean almost giggled at the sight of this but looked down at his place to distract himself.**

**He began to eat his pasta with a traditional fork and spoon, circling the pasta around until he had a full bite ready when someone yelled out loud something he couldn’t quite understand. He looked up from his plate but could see no one in distress. Just then, two attendants raced over to a woman at another table to the left of him who seemed to be choking. It was the man sitting next to her that had yelled out for help.**

 **When Sean looked back at his plate, he jumped back in his seat, horrified. On his plate, instead of spaghetti, was a pile of pinkish-purple worms, wriggling and sliding about. He yelped out loud and the whole room stopped and stared at him. He tried to stand up, forgetting his disability, only causing him to ram his back more into the seat of the wheelchair. The room was silent for a few seconds before he looked back down at the plate. When he did, it was only spaghetti again. Sean was perplexed.**

**“My spaghetti just turned into worms on my plate! And now it's spaghetti again! I swear it was…” his voice trailing away the more ridiculous he sounded as he went on.**

**He looked over at the man who looked at Sean as though he were crazy and said, “Sorry. My bad. I made a mistake, that's all.”**

**Slowly the room returned to the clanging of utensils and dishware and small talk. Sean was relieved to have the attention pulled away from him then. But the man still stared at him intently, making Sean feel like an oddball. Sean suddenly lost his appetite.**

**“Funny how things can happen the way they do, wouldn’t you say?”**

**“I’d say.”**

**“You’re new here. My name’s Albert. Yours?**

**“Sean.”**

**“Nice to meet you, Sean. How’d you end up in the chair?”**

**“Car accident.”**

**“Oh. I see. Was the other guy hurt?”**

**“No. Just me.”**

**“Hmmm. Are you gonna eat your food?”**

**“No. My stomach’s a little nervous. Go ahead.”**

**“Thanks.”**

**Immediately, Albert grabbed Sean’s plate and pushed the contents with his fork onto his plate. He proceeded to shovel in the food in large bites, grossing Sean out even more. He started to talk through his food and that was when Sean found his time to exit. He was wheeling away regardless of what anyone thought when he heard someone say behind him, “You can run but it will always be there lurking inside of you somewhere, fella.”**

**Sean jerked his head to the left and right and saw no one. Then he circled and saw a tiny lady with white hair in a bun staring right at him. She was smiling but it was a sad smile. When they exchanged glances she nodded her head to signify it was her that said it. He looked at her with wonder in his eyes when she turned and walked away down another hall. Sean was left there wondering what the hell she meant by that. He sat there for a moment, less amused and more bothered, before he left the dining hall. He returned to his room to relieve himself, unpack his belongings, and then sleep for the night.**

**But things took a turn when he came across a twenty-sixer of vodka that his brother-in-law must have snuck in there on his visit. He immediately downed three gulps from it, relieved by its effect on him. He was an alcoholic and he knew it. If he was going to let other people he knew in on his secret was another story. He decided that from now on only he would know about how much he drank and when.**

**Taking a fourth gulp, he began to think about what a weird day it had turned out to be his first day at the home. He was seeing and hearing things that were peculiar on a low note and he couldn’t figure out what would have caused those hallucinations. He chalked it up to stress and nothing more after pondering it most of the evening before going to bed.** 

**The bed wasn’t super comfortable but it would do for him. As he was falling asleep, he thought about his future and what it was supposed to be like living without the use of his legs. He told himself that he wouldn’t stay depressed and that he would keep fighting no matter what. Things were the way they were and he had to accept this no matter how shitty it seemed to him. He drifted off finally, drunk and exhausted.**

	**Morning came too soon for Sean, waking him with the gleam of the sun on his face. His mouth felt like cotton balls and he had to pee badly. He lifted himself to his chair like they showed him and adjusted his legs. His hangover was screaming in his head and he was shaking a bit as he flushed the toilet. In order to see his reflection in the mirror he had to sit back near the toilet, and he was alarmed at what he saw there. His face was gaunt and he was greying on the sides prematurely.**

	**“I guess I wasn’t paying very much attention to my looks before the accident. Either I was lying to myself, or the accident did this to me.”**

**He looked from side to side at himself, hoping to catch a good image but there was none. He looked like shit and he knew it.**

	**Sean began the day with some good self-talk and he thought it was actually working when the loudspeaker came on again for breakfast.**

	**He quickly washed his face, brushed, and got dressed to go down when there was a knock at the door. He wheeled over and opened it, but there was no one standing there. He looked down the hall both ways and it was empty. He shrugged his shoulders and went to grab his room key when someone else was at the door. Only this time it was a thunderous banging that he heard.**

**“Just a minute,” he called, racing to the door once again to find again, no one there,**

**“Very funny. What the fuck do you want?”**

**Again, no one was in the hall.**

**“Whatever.”**

**Sean tried to put it all out of his mind and raced to the elevator. He pushed the down button, noticing that calluses were beginning on his hands from the intense use of them with the wheelchair. He kept turning his head as far as he could see behind him, not liking the limitations he had as a disabled. He got himself on the elevator and had lunch without saying a word, paying his mind to everything around him. His breakfast went uneventful.**

**After eating, he decided that he would have a drink with himself just because he could. He dismissed the fact that it wasn't even eleven o’clock yet, rationalizing it and believing that he was under stress and deserved it. It was something he often did to accept his behaviors.**

**He poured himself a strong drink, using the paper cups from the bathroom. He drank it down in two gulps, disliking the taste, but loving its effects.**

**By noon, he finished the bottle and was feeling pretty buzzed from the vodka. He told himself he was going to have to make a trip to the liquor store soon. How he was going to do this he didn’t know yet. He had skipped lunch and his stomach burned pretty bad by one o’clock.** 

**He decided he was going to have a shower, located right next door to where his room was. He got his towels and soap together and put them on his lap to check if it was vacant, and when he saw that it was, he dashed in. The shower was clean, and there was a shower chair for him to utilize, so he took advantage of it. The hot shower felt good on his skin. He let the water fall onto him, trying to drain away the stress of what had happened to him. He was forever changed and he had to face it.**

**As he returned to his room, his mind was flooded with the idea of getting more alcohol. He didn’t know anyone there yet to ask them to pick it up for him and he didn’t want others to know he drank anyhow, so he came up with the idea that he would take a taxi and have the driver purchase it for him. It was really his only alternative in his situation.**

**So, he took his phone with him and waited out front after calling for the cab. It was a nice day and he didn’t need a jacket but he wore it anyway so he could disguise the bottle in it.**

**The cab came fast and agreed to go in for him, receiving a five-dollar tip for his efforts. Sean was having a nice afternoon, or so he thought.**

**When he got back to his room there was another knock at the door. This time, there was someone there.**

**“Hello. Remember me? I’m the guy who sat with you yesterday at dinner. Ring a bell?”**

**“Ya, I remember you. What’s up?”**

**I was wanting to ask you if you would like to come over to my room for coffee?”**

**“I was just about to lay down, maybe another…”**

**“Listen, I don’t have many friends and I am sure you want to find out some things about this place. What d’ya say?”**

**“Thanks but…”**

**“Then, can I come in for a drink? I can see your whiskey bottle poking out of your vest, Sean.”**

**“You’re serious?”**

**“Just one drink and I’ll go.”**

**“All right then, I guess.”**

**Sean opened the door just enough to let the man slip into the room, quietly. He immediately took off his jacket and sat on the empty bed that said 205A on the headboard. Sean sat directly across from him on his own bed.**

**“Thank you kindly, I really appreciate your hospitality.”**

**“It’s alright,” returned.**

**“This is your second time here, am I right?”**

**“Yes, and how did you know my name? I never told you who I was.”**

**“Oh, information travels fast around here. Besides, I’m good at guessing names. Ya believe me?”**

**“I guess. It’s Albert, right?”**

**“Albert it is. Now for that drink?”**

**“You don’t hesitate do you,” Sean said cynically.**

**“I try to stay in the moment.”**

**Sean poured two drinks into paper cups and handed him one.** 

**“There you go. So, what interesting things do you know about this place,” he asked.**

**“Oh, only the important things. Do you have any questions for me?”**

**“Not really. This place seems to be pretty straightforward if you ask me.”**

**“I wouldn’t say that about this place. It had its secrets, you know.”**

**“What kind of secrets?”**

**“Well, I’ll explain a bit about the ways things happen around here,” he said, sipping his drink and flinching. “I’ll begin with the people. Everyone here is paying a price for things they have done in the past. Let’s say that it isn’t much more than a central station where people are sent to that have done things. There are no bars on the windows or locks on the doors… and you can come and go as you please, but… it’s a kind of existential hell here, you see. You can leave any time you want, but where are you really gonna go? And there are other things going on inside these walls. Supernatural things. They are to make you see the wrongs of your ways, in so many words. There are lessons to be learned here.”**

**“What are you saying? That this place has ghosts or something?”**

**“Not exactly. You’ll see in no time.”**

**“I’ve already experienced a few weird things. Am I a target or something?”**

**“Everyone here is targeted. We all have things to learn before we can leave here.”**

**“And what if you don’t learn anything?”**

**“Then you don’t leave.”**

**“What you’re saying is interesting and all, but I think you’re talking out your ass. Apologies.”**

**“None needed, but I think you should mind what's going on around here. It’s in your best interests.”**

**Albert downed the last of his drink and stood up to leave.**

**“Thanks for your words, but I’ll be fine.”**

**“I hope so. Keep your eyes and ears peeled if you know what’s good for ya.”**

**“I will, and thank you.”**

**“See you on the flip side, friend,” Albert stated, leaving the room just as silently as he entered.**

**Sean just sat there, ingesting what the man had just spoken. He thought the man was off-kilter with the jargon he told to him. Just then, the loudspeaker came on and stated, ”We apologize to say that the elevator will be out of use until tomorrow morning. Your meals will be dropped off at your room door at regularly scheduled times. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you.”**

**“Just perfect,” Sean exclaimed to himself. “I didn’t want to leave the room anyhow.”**

**He went to the bathroom to pee and this time he avoided looking at himself in the mirror. He knew he didn’t look good and his day was already scrambled enough.**

**Sean flushed the toilet and wheeled back to the room where he poured another drink, gulping it empty in one gulp. He put the paper cup back on the end table and tilted his head back, closing his eyes to think. When he opened them the room had changed.**

**The walls were wet and the color of blood, shiny. The room was empty of all furniture as well, with just him in his chair. He looked at the door that was also red and yelled out, “What the fuck is going on?!”**

**Just then, the walls began to pulsate in and out as if they were breathing, The noise of wood creaking in his ears. He stayed silent after that, watching and listening to the walls crying out, only closing his eyes in absolute horror. The creaking sound bellowed loud and fierce, creating a scrunched look on his face.**

**When he opened his eyes, which seemed like an eternity, everything was back to normal. The beds and walls were the same, and there was only the sound of the toilet’s running water. He breathed a sigh of relief, wiping the sweat from his upper lip.**

**“What the fuck is wrong with me,” he whispered to himself. “I must be going crazy or something. Holy fuck. What** ***is*** **this place?”**

**He checked his watch and it said four-thirty. They would be coming around with his dinner soon, and if he wanted another bottle he would have to get it after they served him. He decided to rest for a bit on his bed, remembering the luxury of driving his car to work and to the bar every day. A single tear soaked his pillow while he was feeling sorry for himself. Just as he was about to drift off, someone knocked at the door with three sharp bangs.**

**He got out of bed as fast as he could and sped for the door in his wheelchair, he was so hungry. When he answered it, there was a figure before him that he took to be male because of the uniform, but he had no face. All that was there was an oval head with short dark hair. Where the eyes, nose, and mouth should have been, it was only smooth skin.**

**“Rrrhmmmrrffffssstt,” it said.**

**“Aaahhhh,” Sean yelled in return. Rrr Hmmm Rrfff Mmmnnnmmnnn.”**

**Sean slammed the door so hard, that his baseball hat that was hooked on the inside came off and fell to the carpet. Then the knocking came again, even harder this time. Sean was reluctant to answer the door, but in his panic, he knew he had to. Someone or something was on the other side of that door but that was his only way in and out.**

**He turned the knob slowly and pulled the door back a few inches and peeked through the crack.**

	**“Mr. Limly, I have your dinner here. If you don’t want it, all you have to do is tell me.”**

**Sean opened the door ever so slowly to meet the man with his dinner. This time he had a normal face with all his features. He looked and sounded to be of Spadescentecent.**

**“I’ll just take it then.”**

**“It’s pasta with a small salad and apple pie. And, a juice box. It’s all there.”**

**“Thank you so kindly,” Sean spoke quietly. “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what’s come over me.”problemroble, Mr. Limly. We all have our days.”**

**Sean closed the door softly and put his meal on a tray on the end table as well. He knew he had to eat so he forced the pasta down, wondering what could be wrong with him. As he was finishing, he came to the conclusion that it was the Dt’s that he was experiencing and nothing more. A simple explanation for a complex situation.**

**After his meal, he decided to call another cab to buy more whiskey. The trip to the liquor store unfolded without problem and he was once again, back in his room, ready to crack the bottle.**

**He got himself a drink and gulped it down straight away, pouring another to ease the tension he felt in the small room. He gulped the second one grimacing at its bitter strength. He breathed out the heat from the whiskey through his mouth, pouring a third,  settling down a bit.**

**“I’m going fucking nuts and I’ve only been here three days damned it! What is** ***wrong*** **with me?!”**

**“I’ll tell you what’s wrong with you. You’re having hallucinations, Sean. The kind of hallucinations that try to tell you something. Get it?”**

**He looked over to the left at the floor where the voice was coming from and only saw the central air vent. That wasn’t what was talking to him, was it?**

**“I am here to show you things about yourself, Sean. You are here to face what you have done wrong, Do you know what you have done wrong?”**

**“I am not talking to the heater vent. Who’s doing this to me? Are you the people next door trying to make me thi'nk I’m crazy?! I bet you are. Well, I’m not falling for it for one second, you hear me? It's not not your neighbor, Sean. It’s more than that and you need to listen carefully to what I have to say.”**

**“I don’t have to listen to shit.”**

**“Yes, you do, and you will.”**

**“Says who? And you can’t stop me from saying what I have to say. I mean, who’s going to believe that there are voices coming from the vent, Sean? Who would believe you?”**

**“I don’t care. I’ll block you out.”**

**“How?”**

**“I’ll… put on some music really loud.”**

**“You’ll still hear me.”**

**“Will I, now?”**

**Sean grabbed for his phone and found a playlist of downloaded country songs and hit the play button. Hank William Jr. began to bellow from the cell phone, raspy from having it on full blast. He was singing about country boys surviving… Sean listened for the voice.**

**“I’m still here.”**

**Sean heard the manly voice as clear as a bell in his head.**

**“Damn. What do you want from me?!”**

**“I want to tell you something.”**

**“There is nothing for me to learn about the accident. It’s done and so am I. I have no life now.”**

**“I am not talking about your current situation, Sean. What were you doing five winters ago, can you remember?”**

**“I can’t even remember two years ago. I was probably working. So what?”**

**“So, five winters ago you did something. Something really bad. Do you recall what it is?”**

**“I am not a bad person. I think you have someone else.”**

**“ No, I'm sure I have the right man. Sean, you are a murderer.”**

**“I have never laid a hand on anyone in my life. I am a nonviolent person. I don’t even like confrontation.”**

**“I can see that, but you like to drink, don’t you?”**

**There was another knock at the door. Sean answered it, hoping that they could explain the voice from the vent. He felt hysterically hopeful.**

**“Mr. Limly, could you please keep your music down a bit? Other people are complaining that it’s too loud. You wouldn’t mind, would you?”**

**“No problem, but could you come in for a minute? I want you to take a look at something.”**

**“Sure. No problem, but it has to be quick. I am a busy lady.”**

**“What’s your name?”** 

**“Veronica, but everyone calls me Vicky”**

**Listen, Vicky, come over here for a second. I want you to just listen to this vent. It’s been saying things to me and I want you to hear it for yourself. I know it sounds crazy, but…”**

**“You’re probably just hearing people from other rooms talking. But, I’ll humor you,” she said smiling. She was a young and pretty twenty-three year-old Chinese woman who really did not have the time for him but obliged Sean.**

**Vicky walked over to the vent and noticed the open bottle on the nightstand, and quickly made her judgment before she could listen to anything.**

**“Mr. Limly, have you been drinking?. You know we have a policy here that there should be no intoxicated behaviors going on…”**

**“I am not drunk. Just listen now.”**

**“She can’t hear me like you do, Sean,” the voice spoke.**

**“There! You see?! You heard it, right?”**

**“No, I can't hear anything. I think you may just need some more rest. The accident left you…”**

**“*****Fuck*** **the accident. Are you telling me you didn’t hear that?”**

**“I am telling you I can’t hear anything come from the vent. Now…”**

**“Well, fuck you then! You’re just lying to me to make me think I’m crazy. Well, I’m not!”**

**“Mr. Limly…**

**“Just get out!”**

**“I am reporting your intolerable behavior. You can talk to management about it all. Goodbye.”**

**Vicky left quietly but upset. Sean sat in the chair, still staring at the grate in unbelief.**

**“I can’t fucking believe this! What do you want from me? And why are you talking to me in fashion? If I have done something wrong you can say it to my face. You don’t have to play games.”**

**“This is not a game.”**

**“Then show yourself.”**

**“I am speaking to you in this manner because you** ***are*** **insane, Sean. Nothing is going to be the same from now on. I guess I should tell you why you went insane, shouldn’t I now?”**

**“Yes! But I am not crazy,”**

**“Oh yes you are. Or at least you will be. This is only the beginning. Five winters ago, you were driving home drunk and you hit someone. You hit them with your car while you were drunk, and killed them. It was a woman on her way home from work, walking in the snow, crossing on a side street, and you hit her. Hard enough to kill her Sean. And when you saw what you did, you took off. Do you remember any of this?”**

**Sean wheeled over to the nightstand and pounded the drink down, pouring a fourth. He looked over at the vent and tried to rack his brain to recall anything like what the voice said. He could not. He just sat there, perplexed**

**“Think back on it. You must surely know something about the hit and run.”**

**“I didn’t hit ANYONE!”**

**“You most surely did.”**

**Sean began to cry then. He sobbed loudly, knowing deep in his core that it could have been possible. He had driven home so many times in a blackout that it could be possible that he hit someone and just wasn’t aware of it.**

**“Did I hit someone,” he asked softly.**

**“Yes, you did. Why do you think you are paralyzed, Sean? Being in that chair is the karma you are receiving from the murder you committed. It was your fate and now you must live with this.”**

**“Who knows about this?”**

**“Just you and us.”**

**“Who are you?”**

**“It is none of your business who we are, Sean. That’s not the point. What you have done you are paying for with your body and your sanity.”**

**“But I didn’t do it on purpose,” Sean whined.**

**“You must still pay the price.”**

**“What’s going to happen to me?”**

**“Where you are, you will experience things fitting to what you have done. We will be back in a very short time. For now, we will simply let you feel the weight of what you have done.”**

**Sean collapsed onto the floor next to the grate, fingering the steel while his nose ran snot onto the carpet.**

**“I’m sorry! I’m so sorry,” he whined so loud that there was another knock at the door not long after.**

**Sean didn’t answer this time and the attendant waited minutes until finally entering the room with a main key. What Vicky saw was startling.**

**She found the new resident sprawled on the floor, lying in his own urine, drooling all over himself. His hair was completely white as he stared up at the ceiling repeating to himself, “I’m sorry,,, I’m sorry…”**

**She left the room and went to the nurse’s station, where Nurse Angela was working as head nurse for the shift. Right away Vicky said sarcastically, “We got another one feeling sorry for himself. Why do they always send us the ones who are still in the realization stage? Why can’t they ship us the ones who are at a level of repentance that’s more respectful? We always get the sloppy ones who are still practicing their sins… I need a vacation.”**

**“I agree,” Vicly returned. “But, we have a job to do here. Prepare them for either ascension or condemnation. Where do you think this one’s  going?”**

**“No clue just yet. We’ll bide our time and see, I guess. Call the paramedics. This one will be seeing psychiatry for a while before we plant anything more on him.”**

**“Another day ay Helping Hands…”**

He then stood up on his 2 legs to see what's on top. I thought he saw a rat. Few seconds later he jumps on it then jumps down staring and sniffing. Suddenly a average butterfly moth looking fly. Flies around and starts following across the room... To the desk... 

He jumps onto a seat onto the desk and saw it sit on the wall. They both stared at each other. 
If jump up to grab it with 2 paws and started eating or biting but I don't think he got a good bite he suddenly looked down the corner of the desk 😂 I think the dead flying object feel between the wall and desk. 

He was left peeping through. Stood up licked the wall... Stayed there as I wrote this whole post... Now he's gone back to the original spot and is waiting for another to fly out...

**Sean woke up from his coma after four months with an insatiable hunger for food. The first thing out of his mouth to the nurse was “french fries”. He was forty-two years old and he was awake. It was a car collision that involved him and another fellow. He had run a red light during the wee hours of the night on a busy city street, crashing into the other man on the passenger side, not harming him. The unfortunate part was that he was left paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his natural life. He had been awake for four days by the time he had gotten any visits while in the hospital.**

**He was sitting up eating a bowl of ice cream and looking down at his legs.**

**“So, for now, you’re going to be staying at an assisted living home. Because the accident was ruled as your fault, your insurance isn’t compensating for the accident. You will be relying on the government disability act until or if you even can go back to work. Get it?”**

**“I get it. I’m a bum now until I show them I can still handle work requirements. Simply put, I’m fucked. I can’t operate the machinery at the plant anymore, so I’ll be waiting for a monthly payoff of peanuts for the rest of my shitty life. I get it, Mark. Who sent you anyway?”**

**“John did because he knows you’re my brother-in-law so he figured…”**

**“He figured he could pass the job of telling me to you.** 

**“I guess.”**

**“Well, it’s done then. Thanks for coming by.”**

**“No problem. The doctor said that you’ll be okay to leave after they’ve rendered you capable.”**

**“Cool. I hate this hospital. The only thing that’s good about this place is the desserts. The nurses here are dogs. Have you seen them? They're a bunch of mutts.”**

**“Sean, leave it to you to say something vulgar like that.”**

**“Hey, nothing's wrong with my libido, brother.”**

**“So, do you need anything else?”**

**“Ya, get me some Mars bars from the Canteen, will ya?”**

**“Done deal. Then I have to leave. Busy weekend for us, you know how it is.”**

**“No, I don’t but I am sympathetic to you. Spend time with my sister and be good to her, eh?”**

**“Always, Sean.”**

**When Sean was finally alone, he had time to contemplate just what had occurred. All he could remember about the accident was leaving the bar. He had been drinking at Al’s all evening hitting on a woman who frequented there often but would never give in to his advances. Lee was her name and she always played hard to get with Sean. On the evenings that they would run into each other, she would ask him to play a game of pool with her, always accepting the drink he would offer to buy. Vodka and seven on ice was her drink and he never got it wrong. He would let her win every game, being as pleasant as he could in his efforts to lay her. She was his type and he just loved the way she laughed. But she was a player and the method to her madness was to get free drinks from the bachelors. It worked quite well for her when she stuck to the dive bars around town.**

**On those nights, including the night of the crash, he would leave the bar alone. And that is all he remembered about that night, drinking and playing pool with Lee, getting cut off for the night by the bartender, and getting in his car to drive home. The accident itself failed to be conscious in his mind.**

**Sean kept trying to jog his memory of that night but nothing ever stood out as a clear memory. It all fell into place as just another night at the bar in his mind and nothing more.**

**But he knew that this wasn’t the case as he tried to move his legs at all. The injuries that he took away from the accident were a broken left wrist, a broken neck, some minor cuts and bruises, and a chipped tooth. When he spoke to the doctor, he said that they were hoping in time that he may regain some of the feelings in his legs but he would never walk again. Every time he thought about this he got depressed, staying with him the whole time he was in the hospital.**

**On discharge day, he was so revved up to get going, that he couldn’t keep his hands still. He would use the phone, then flick the channels on the television, or scribble notes on paper that were relatively meaningless.**

**Anything to keep him occupied.**

**“Mr. Vader, are you ready to leave? Have they given you your belongings yet?”**

**“I think so. Yes. I am geeked to get out of here, that’s for sure”**

**“Good. The chair is yours until you get your real chair. I’ll wheel you downstairs where there will be a cab coming for you soon. All set?”**

**“I guess,” Sean said listlessly.**

**The cab was already waiting there by the time they got to the entrance. He was helped in and quickly dropped off at the Helping Hands Assisted Living Institution on the other side of the city. The occupational nurse at the hospital showed Sean how to leverage his weight and get himself in and out of the chair to do practical duties. He was still very new to it, so it took him time to get from one position to the next.**

**He sat in front of the home taking it in that he was dependent on others from now on to get around and perform certain tasks. Sean wasn’t the type to rely on people, so it was very difficult for him to accept this fate. He took a mental image of the building and pushed his way through the door and to the front desk.**

**Right away, he was greeted by a nurse in a loose-fitting uniform, who introduced herself as Patricia. They exchanged greetings, and he was shown to his room. He would remember her name by relating it to her toothy smile. He liked her right away and told himself to ask her if he ever needed anything.**

**He sat in the wheelchair, staring around the room at his shared situation. The room consisted of two beds, two dressers, two end tables, and a television mounted on the wall. His bed was located beside the window labeled on the headboard as “205B. 205A was empty it seemed so for the time being he had the room to himself. All in all the room was pleasant with two very large paintings of scenery and wall-to-wall carpeting in burgundy to add to the decor.** 

**Sean wheeled around the room, taking it all in, noticing the central air and ensuite bathroom. About five minutes into this the loudspeaker from the hall went off with a voice from administration.**

**“To all residents… dinner will be served at four-thirty pm. Please feel free to utilize our coffee and tea service. Thanks.”**

**Sean checked his watch which said four-twelve pm. That gave him time to wheel himself to the elevator and discover the dining room on the first floor. He could feel his arms burning from the weight as he approached the elevator. Just as he was arriving at the doors, they opened. He saw it was Patricia again but he froze in shock when she exited the doors. Her face was a mess of decay and rot, her cheeks hanging and her teeth exposed. One of her eyes was missing and she had no tongue. She tried to say something to him but it only came out as a garbled retching at him. He yelped and pushed himself back in terror. She walked right by him and turned her face away. For a moment he just sat there, and when he turned himself around to look once again, she was normal. Her face wasn’t grotesque anymore. She smiled at him with a fresh face, eyes bright and cheery. He forced a small back and got himself on the elevator, completely indifferent to what had just happened.**

**He was breathing heavily as the elevator took him from the second floor to the first, unable to process what he had just seen.**

**“You’re hallucinating now too buddy. Get a grip. It’s probably one of my medications that’s doing this to me.”**

**Once out of the noisy elevator, he entered the large cafeteria-style area where people were lined up to two servers that doled out food at the back of the room. Sean took his place at the back of the line and waited his turn. There were about fourteen people ahead of him and he figured it would be awhile before he set down to eat. He fixed his gaze on everyone already seated. There were all different types of characters eating their meals at the tables. He was eager to see what kind of food they served at the establishment he was now a part of.**

**He started to think about Patricia and how her face had changed. He just couldn’t figure out how his mind could trick him like that. When it was his turn to pick out his food he was impressed. He had choices of two different dishes and he picked the pasta and salad for himself, along with a glass of milk and coffee. They even had a fruit cup for dessert but he passed it by. He sat down at a table where there was only one other person seated. It was a man in his forties who looked rather thin and sinewy in appearance. He had a five o’clock shadow and no front teeth to chew with. Every time he closed his jaw to chew it looked as though half of his face disappeared. Sean almost giggled at the sight of this but looked down at his place to distract himself.**

**He began to eat his pasta with a traditional fork and spoon, circling the pasta around until he had a full bite ready when someone yelled out loud something he couldn’t quite understand. He looked up from his plate but could see no one in distress. Just then, two attendants raced over to a woman at another table to the left of him who seemed to be choking. It was the man sitting next to her that had yelled out for help.**

 **When Sean looked back at his plate, he jumped back in his seat, horrified. On his plate, instead of spaghetti, was a pile of pinkish-purple worms, wriggling and sliding about. He yelped out loud and the whole room stopped and stared at him. He tried to stand up, forgetting his disability, only causing him to ram his back more into the seat of the wheelchair. The room was silent for a few seconds before he looked back down at the plate. When he did, it was only spaghetti again. Sean was perplexed.**

**“My spaghetti just turned into worms on my plate! And now it's spaghetti again! I swear it was…” his voice trailing away the more ridiculous he sounded as he went on.**

**He looked over at the man who looked at Sean as though he were crazy and said, “Sorry. My bad. I made a mistake, that's all.”**

**Slowly the room returned to the clanging of utensils and dishware and small talk. Sean was relieved to have the attention pulled away from him then. But the man still stared at him intently, making Sean feel like an oddball. Sean suddenly lost his appetite.**

**“Funny how things can happen the way they do, wouldn’t you say?”**

**“I’d say.”**

**“You’re new here. My name’s Albert. Yours?**

**“Sean.”**

**“Nice to meet you, Sean. How’d you end up in the chair?”**

**“Car accident.”**

**“Oh. I see. Was the other guy hurt?”**

**“No. Just me.”**

**“Hmmm. Are you gonna eat your food?”**

**“No. My stomach’s a little nervous. Go ahead.”**

**“Thanks.”**

**Immediately, Albert grabbed Sean’s plate and pushed the contents with his fork onto his plate. He proceeded to shovel in the food in large bites, grossing Sean out even more. He started to talk through his food and that was when Sean found his time to exit. He was wheeling away regardless of what anyone thought when he heard someone say behind him, “You can run but it will always be there lurking inside of you somewhere, fella.”**

**Sean jerked his head to the left and right and saw no one. Then he circled and saw a tiny lady with white hair in a bun staring right at him. She was smiling but it was a sad smile. When they exchanged glances she nodded her head to signify it was her that said it. He looked at her with wonder in his eyes when she turned and walked away down another hall. Sean was left there wondering what the hell she meant by that. He sat there for a moment, less amused and more bothered, before he left the dining hall. He returned to his room to relieve himself, unpack his belongings, and then sleep for the night.**

**But things took a turn when he came across a twenty-sixer of vodka that his brother-in-law must have snuck in there on his visit. He immediately downed three gulps from it, relieved by its effect on him. He was an alcoholic and he knew it. If he was going to let other people he knew in on his secret was another story. He decided that from now on only he would know about how much he drank and when.**

**Taking a fourth gulp, he began to think about what a weird day it had turned out to be his first day at the home. He was seeing and hearing things that were peculiar on a low note and he couldn’t figure out what would have caused those hallucinations. He chalked it up to stress and nothing more after pondering it most of the evening before going to bed.** 

**The bed wasn’t super comfortable but it would do for him. As he was falling asleep, he thought about his future and what it was supposed to be like living without the use of his legs. He told himself that he wouldn’t stay depressed and that he would keep fighting no matter what. Things were the way they were and he had to accept this no matter how shitty it seemed to him. He drifted off finally, drunk and exhausted.**

	**Morning came too soon for Sean, waking him with the gleam of the sun on his face. His mouth felt like cotton balls and he had to pee badly. He lifted himself to his chair like they showed him and adjusted his legs. His hangover was screaming in his head and he was shaking a bit as he flushed the toilet. To see his reflection in the mirror he had to sit back near the toilet, and he was alarmed at what he saw there. His face was gaunt and he was greying on the sides prematurely.**

	**“I guess I wasn’t paying very much attention to my looks before the accident. Either I was lying to myself, or the accident did this to me.”**

**He looked from side to side at himself, hoping to catch a good image but there was none. He looked like shit and he knew it.**

	**Sean began the day with some good self-talk and he thought it was working when the loudspeaker came on again for breakfast.**

	**He quickly washed his face, brushed, and got dressed to go down when there was a knock at the door. He wheeled over and opened it, but there was no one standing there. He looked down the hall both ways and it was empty. He shrugged his shoulders and went to grab his room key when someone else was at the door. Only this time it was a thunderous banging that he heard.**

**“Just a minute,” he called, racing to the door once again to find again, no one there,**

**“Very funny. What the fuck do you want?”**

**Again, no one was in the hall.**

**“Whatever.”**

**Sean tried to put it all out of his mind and raced to the elevator. He pushed the down button, noticing that calluses were beginning on his hands from the intense use of them with the wheelchair. He kept turning his head as far as he could see behind him, not liking the limitations he had as a disabled. He got himself on the elevator and had lunch without saying a word, paying his mind to everything around him. His breakfast went uneventful.**

**After eating, he decided that he would have a drink with himself just because he could. He dismissed the fact that it wasn't even eleven o’clock yet, rationalizing it and believing that he was under stress and deserved it. It was something he often did to accept his behaviors.**

**He poured himself a strong drink, using the paper cups from the bathroom. He drank it down in two gulps, disliking the taste, but loving its effects.**

**By noon, he finished the bottle and was feeling pretty buzzed from the vodka. He told himself he was going to have to make a trip to the liquor store soon. How he was going to do this he didn’t know yet. He had skipped lunch and his stomach burned pretty bad by one o’clock.** 

**He decided he was going to have a shower, located right next door to where his room was. He got his towels and soap together and put them on his lap to check if it was vacant, and when he saw that it was, he dashed in. The shower was clean, and there was a shower chair for him to utilize, so he took advantage of it. The hot shower felt good on his skin. He let the water fall onto him, trying to drain away the stress of what had happened to him. He was forever changed and he had to face it.**

**As he returned to his room, his mind was flooded with the idea of getting more alcohol. He didn’t know anyone there yet to ask them to pick it up for him and he didn’t want others to know he drank anyhow, so he came up with the idea that he would take a taxi and have the driver purchase it for him. It was his only alternative in his situation.**

**So, he took his phone with him and waited out front after calling for the cab. It was a nice day and he didn’t need a jacket but he wore it anyway so he could disguise the bottle in it.**

**The cab came fast and agreed to go in for him, receiving a five-dollar tip for his efforts. Sean was having a nice afternoon, or so he thought.**

**When he got back to his room there was another knock at the door. This time, there was someone there.**

**“Hello. Remember me? I’m the guy who sat with you yesterday at dinner. Ring a bell?”**

**“Ya, I remember you. What’s up?”**

**I was wanting to ask you if you would like to come over to my room for coffee?”**

**“I was just about to lay down, maybe another…”**

**“Listen, I don’t have many friends and I am sure you want to find out some things about this place. What d’ya say?”**

**“Thanks but…”**

**“Then, can I come in for a drink? I can see your whiskey bottle poking out of your vest, Sean.”**

**“You’re serious?”**

**“Just one drink and I’ll go.”**

**“All right then, I guess.”**

**Sean opened the door just enough to let the man slip into the room, quietly. He immediately took off his jacket and sat on the empty bed that said 205A on the headboard. Sean sat directly across from him on his bed.**

**“Thank you kindly, I appreciate your hospitality.”**

**“It’s alright,” returned.**

**“This is your second time here, am I right?”**

**“Yes, and how did you know my name? I never told you who I was.”**

**“Oh, information travels fast around here. Besides, I’m good at guessing names. Ya believe me?”**

**“I guess. It’s Albert, right?”**

**“Albert it is. Now for that drink?”**

**“You don’t hesitate do you,” Sean said cynically.**

**“I try to stay in the moment.”**

**Sean poured two drinks into paper cups and handed him one.** 

**“There you go. So, what interesting things do you know about this place,” he asked.**

**“Oh, only the important things. Do you have any questions for me?”**

**“Not really. This place seems to be pretty straightforward if you ask me.”**

**“I wouldn’t say that about this place. It had its secrets, you know.”**

**“What kind of secrets?”**

**“Well, I’ll explain a bit about the ways things happen around here,” he said, sipping his drink and flinching. “I’ll begin with the people. Everyone here is paying a price for things they have done in the past. Let’s say that it isn’t much more than a central station where people are sent to that have done things. There are no bars on the windows or locks on the doors… and you can come and go as you please, but… it’s a kind of existential hell here, you see. You can leave any time you want, but where are you gonna go? And other things are going on inside these walls. Supernatural things. They are to make you see the wrongs of your ways, in so many words. There are lessons to be learned here.”**

**“What are you saying? That this place has ghosts or something?”**

**“Not exactly. You’ll see in no time.”**

**“I’ve already experienced a few weird things. Am I a target or something?”**

**“Everyone here is targeted. We all have things to learn before we can leave here.”**

**“And what if you don’t learn anything?”**

**“Then you don’t leave.”**

**“What you’re saying is interesting and all, but I think you’re talking out your ass. Apologies.”**

**“None needed, but I think you should mind what's going on around here. It’s in your best interests.”**

**Albert downed the last of his drink and stood up to leave.**

**“Thanks for your words, but I’ll be fine.”**

**“I hope so. Keep your eyes and ears peeled if you know what’s good for ya.”**

**“I will, and thank you.”**

**“See you on the flip side, friend,” Albert stated, leaving the room just as silently as he entered.**

**Sean just sat there, ingesting what the man had just spoken. He thought the man was off-kilter with the jargon he told to him. Just then, the loudspeaker came on and stated, ”We apologize to say that the elevator will be out of use until tomorrow morning. Your meals will be dropped off at your room door at regularly scheduled times. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you.”**

**“Just perfect,” Sean exclaimed to himself. “I didn’t want to leave the room anyhow.”**

**He went to the bathroom to pee and this time he avoided looking at himself in the mirror. He knew he didn’t look good and his day was already scrambled enough.**

**Sean flushed the toilet and wheeled back to the room where he poured another drink, gulping it empty in one gulp. He put the paper cup back on the end table and tilted his head back, closing his eyes to think. When he opened them the room had changed.**

**The walls were wet and the color of blood, shiny. The room was empty of all furniture as well, with just him in his chair. He looked at the door that was also red and yelled out, “What the fuck is going on?!”**

**Just then, the walls began to pulsate in and out as if they were breathing, The noise of wood creaking in his ears. He stayed silent after that, watching and listening to the walls crying out, only closing his eyes in absolute horror. The creaking sound bellowed loud and fierce, creating a scrunched look on his face.**

**When he opened his eyes, which seemed like an eternity, everything was back to normal. The beds and walls were the same, and there was only the sound of the toilet’s running water. He breathed a sigh of relief, wiping the sweat from his upper lip.**

**“What the fuck is wrong with me,” he whispered to himself. “I must be going crazy or something. Holy fuck. What** ***is*** **this place?”**

**He checked his watch and it said four-thirty. They would be coming around with his dinner soon, and if he wanted another bottle he would have to get it after they served him. He decided to rest for a bit on his bed, remembering the luxury of driving his car to work and to the bar every day. A single tear soaked his pillow while he was feeling sorry for himself. Just as he was about to drift off, someone knocked at the door with three sharp bangs.**

**He got out of bed as fast as he could and sped for the door in his wheelchair, he was so hungry. When he answered it, there was a figure before him that he took to be male because of the uniform, but he had no face. All that was there was an oval head with short dark hair. Where the eyes, nose, and mouth should have been, it was only smooth skin.**

**“Rrrhmmmrrffffssstt,” it said.**

**“Aaahhhh,” Sean yelled in return. Rrr Hmmm Rrfff Mmmnnnmmnnn.”**

**Sean slammed the door so hard, that his baseball hat that was hooked on the inside came off and fell to the carpet. Then the knocking came again, even harder this time. Sean was reluctant to answer the door, but in his panic, he knew he had to. Someone or something was on the other side of that door but that was his only way in and out.**

**He turned the knob slowly and pulled the door back a few inches and peeked through the crack.**

	**“Mr. Limly, I have your dinner here. If you don’t want it, all you have to do is tell me.”**

**Sean opened the door ever so slowly to meet the man with his dinner. This time he had a normal face with all his features. He looked and sounded to be of Spadescentecent.**

**“I’ll just take it then.”**

**“It’s pasta with a small salad and apple pie. And, a juice box. It’s all there.”**

**“Thank you so kindly,” Sean spoke quietly. “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what’s come over me.”problemroble, Mr. Limly. We all have our days.”**

**Sean closed the door softly and put his meal on a tray on the end table as well. He knew he had to eat so he forced the pasta down, wondering what could be wrong with him. As he was finishing, he concluded that it was the Dt’s that he was experiencing and nothing more. A simple explanation for a complex situation.**

**After his meal, he decided to call another cab to buy more whiskey. The trip to the liquor store unfolded without problem and he was once again, back in his room, ready to crack the bottle.**

**He got himself a drink and gulped it down straight away, pouring another to ease the tension he felt in the small room. He gulped the second one grimacing at its bitter strength. He breathed out the heat from the whiskey through his mouth, pouring a third,  settling down a bit.**

**“I’m going fucking nuts and I’ve only been here three days damned it! What is** ***wrong*** **with me?!”**

**“I’ll tell you what’s wrong with you. You’re having hallucinations, Sean. The kind of hallucinations that try to tell you something. Get it?”**

**He looked over to the left at the floor where the voice was coming from and only saw the central air vent. That wasn’t what was talking to him, was it?**

**“I am here to show you things about yourself, Sean. You are here to face what you have done wrong, Do you know what you have done wrong?”**

**“I am not talking to the heater vent. Who’s doing this to me? Are you the people next door trying to make me think I’m crazy?! I bet you are. Well, I’m not falling for it for one second, you hear me? It's not not your neighbor, Sean. It’s more than that and you need to listen carefully to what I have to say.”**

**“I don’t have to listen to shit.”**

**“Yes, you do, and you will.”**

**“Says who? And you can’t stop me from saying what I have to say. I mean, who’s going to believe that voices are coming from the vent, Sean? Who would believe you?”**

**“I don’t care. I’ll block you out.”**

**“How?”**

**“I’ll… put on some music loud.”**

**“You’ll still hear me.”**

**“Will I, now?”**

**Sean grabbed for his phone, found a playlist of downloaded country songs, and hit the play button. Hank William Jr. began to bellow from the cell phone, raspy from having it on full blast. He was singing about country boys surviving… Sean listened for the voice.**

**“I’m still here.”**

**Sean heard the manly voice as clear as a bell in his head.**

**“Damn. What do you want from me?!”**

**“I want to tell you something.”**

**“There is nothing for me to learn about the accident. It’s done and so am I. I have no life now.”**

**“I am not talking about your current situation, Sean. What were you doing five winters ago, can you remember?”**

**“I can’t even remember two years ago. I was probably working. So what?”**

**“So, five winters ago you did something. Something really bad. Do you recall what it is?”**

**“I am not a bad person. I think you have someone else.”**

**“ No, I'm sure I have the right man. Sean, you are a murderer.”**

**“I have never laid a hand on anyone in my life. I am a nonviolent person. I don’t even like confrontation.”**

**“I can see that, but you like to drink, don’t you?”**

**There was another knock at the door. Sean answered it, hoping that they could explain the voice from the vent. He felt hysterically hopeful.**

**“Mr. Limly, could you please keep your music down a bit? Other people are complaining that it’s too loud. You wouldn’t mind, would you?”**

**“No problem, but could you come in for a minute? I want you to take a look at something.”**

**“Sure. No problem, but it has to be quick. I am a busy lady.”**

**“What’s your name?”** 

**“Veronica, but everyone calls me Vicky”**

**Listen, Vicky, come over here for a second. I want you to just listen to this vent. It’s been saying things to me and I want you to hear it for yourself. I know it sounds crazy, but…”**

**“You’re probably just hearing people from other rooms talking. But, I’ll humor you,” she said smiling. She was a young and pretty twenty-three-year-old Chinese woman who did not have the time for him but obliged Sean.**

**Vicky walked over to the vent noticed the open bottle on the nightstand, and quickly made her judgment before she could listen to anything.**

**“Mr. Limly, have you been drinking? You know we have a policy here that there should be no intoxicated behaviors going on…”**

**“I am not drunk. Just listen now.”**

**“She can’t hear me like you do, Sean,” the voice spoke.**

**“There! Do you see?! You heard it, right?”**

**“No, I can't hear anything. I think you may just need some more rest. The accident left you…”**

**“*****Fuck*** **the accident. Are you telling me you didn’t hear that?”**

**“I am telling you I can’t hear anything come from the vent. Now…”**

**“Well, fuck you then! You’re just lying to me to make me think I’m crazy. Well, I’m not!”**

**“Mr. Limly…**

**“Just get out!”**

**“I am reporting your intolerable behavior. You can talk to management about it all. Goodbye.”**

**Vicky left quietly but upset. Sean sat in the chair, still staring at the grate in unbelief.**

**“I can’t fucking believe this! What do you want from me? And why are you talking to me in fashion? If I have done something wrong you can say it to my face. You don’t have to play games.”**

**“This is not a game.”**

**“Then show yourself.”**

**“I am speaking to you in this manner because you** ***are*** **insane, Sean. Nothing is going to be the same from now on. I guess I should tell you why you went insane, shouldn’t I now?”**

**“Yes! But I am not crazy,”**

**“Oh yes, you are. Or at least you will be. This is only the beginning. Five winters ago, you were driving home drunk and you hit someone. You hit them with your car while you were drunk, and killed them. It was a woman on her way home from work, walking in the snow, crossing on a side street, and you hit her. Hard enough to kill her Sean. And when you saw what you did, you took off. Do you remember any of this?”**

**Sean wheeled over to the nightstand and pounded the drink down, pouring a fourth. He looked over at the vent and tried to rack his brain to recall anything like what the voice said. He could not. He just sat there, perplexed**

**“Think back on it. You must surely know something about the hit and run.”**

**“I didn’t hit ANYONE!”**

**“You most surely did.”**

**Sean began to cry then. He sobbed loudly, knowing deep in his core that it could have been possible. He had driven home so many times in a blackout that it could be possible that he hit someone and just wasn’t aware of it.**

**“Did I hit someone,” he asked softly.**

**“Yes, you did. Why do you think you are paralyzed, Sean? Being in that chair is the karma you are receiving from the murder you committed. It was your fate and now you must live with this.”**

**“Who knows about this?”**

**“Just you and us.”**

**“Who are you?”**

**“It is none of your business who we are, Sean. That’s not the point. What you have done you are paying for with your body and your sanity.”**

**“But I didn’t do it on purpose,” Sean whined.**

**“You must still pay the price.”**

**“What’s going to happen to me?”**

**“Where you are, you will experience things fitting to what you have done. We will be back in a very short time. For now, we will simply let you feel the weight of what you have done.”**

**Sean collapsed onto the floor next to the grate, fingering the steel while his nose ran snot onto the carpet.**

**“I’m sorry! I’m so sorry,” he whined so loud that there was another knock at the door not long after.**

**Sean didn’t answer this time and the attendant waited minutes until finally entering the room with a main key. What Vicky saw was startling.**

**She found the new resident sprawled on the floor, lying in his urine, drooling all over himself. His hair was completely white as he stared up at the ceiling repeating to himself, “I’m sorry,,, I’m sorry…”**

**She left the room and went to the nurse’s station, where Nurse Angela was working as head nurse for the shift. Right away Vicky said sarcastically, “We got another one feeling sorry for himself. Why do they always send us the ones who are still in the realization stage? Why can’t they ship us the ones who are at a level of repentance that’s more respectful? We always get the sloppy ones who are still practicing their sins… I need a vacation.”**

**“I agree,” Vicly returned. “But, we have a job to do here. Prepare them for either ascension or condemnation. Where do you think this one’s  going?”**

**“No clue just yet. We’ll bide our time and see, I guess. Call the paramedics. This one will be seeing psychiatry for a while before we plant anything more on him.”**

**“Another day ay Helping Hands…”**

The escape hatch floated free as the explosive latch pins detonated, sending it out amongst the asteroids in the field.  With only the dull glow of the cooling engine baffles to light it, the tumbling shape became just another piece of the chaotic motion of the area.

""Just a little farther, Liz."" Wilson's rasping voice came over his labored breath as he worked the damaged powered armor through the small hatchway with the motion of just one arm.

""I only have a few more minutes, Sergeant."" The calm, velvety female voice came from the earphones, ""Power reserves are reaching their limits, and I will have to hibernate to prolong your life support.  I have activated the emergency beacon, but the communications gear is not reacting to the reboot. Sorry.""


Wilson kicked off from the disabled hulk that recently was the Drasalite vessel.  The lack of gravity actually made his broken arm hurt less, but given that the only real light now came from the distant star of the system, the isolation was heightened.  The suit's HUD was only operating intermittently, sudden bursts of green outline covering the dull blackness that comprised the regular human vision of the Cap Trooper.  The sporadic light that came from asteroid impacts on the Drasalite ship gave him something to watch; the pulverized bits adding to the detritus of the asteroid field.

""Liz... It's okay.  I really appreciate your help.  We saved the people who we needed to protect, and ..."" Wilson took a deep breath before he continued, ""... we did our job.  You know, honestly, I missed doing that, and I've never had a better partner.  I... I want you to override your shutdown, and stay with me until the end, okay?""

There was a long pause as the powered armor drifted amongst the lumps of rock, then the rich female voice faltered, ""Serg-... Rutherford, I... I'm honored.  Though I only recently achieved full sentience, in all of my previous operational data, I have never experienced such a successful and fulfilling operation.""

There was a short pause, then the female voice came back.  ""Override command accepted.  I will spend my final moments with you.""

Wilson grinned. ""Well, let's not write everything off yet. Let's try and get the jump juice refilled...""

Liz's rich, calm voice was somewhat subdued as it sounded in the Cap Trooper's ears, ""Rutherford, given that you stored the extra cannisters in the back left storage area, and the left shoulder and elbow joints have suffered extensive damage, my assessment is that you will not be able to access the fuel.""

Wilson tried to move the suit's left arm before the pain of his broken forearm caused him to pause.  As he ceased movement, he took a deep breath of the hot, dry air that seemed a little thicker than it had been a few minutes before.  ""So... No real boosters, then?""

""I'm sorry, no."" The sultry voice answered, still calm, but with a sorrowful edge.  ""The 'Endgame' protocol is about to be enacted...  Please excuse me, but I am overriding the random function.  I can't stand to play *Major Tom* for you...""

""Whatever you think is best, Liz. You've looked out for me so far...""  Wilson didn't know the media that Liz referenced, and was having some problems focusing anyhow.  The blood loss and exhaustion were taking their toll now that the adrenaline was ebbing from his system.

The damaged black powered armor drifted amongst the asteroids in silence for a minute before the HUD flickered again with the indication that the 'Endgame' batch file was started, the song *[Last Morning](https://youtu.be/vCDJj3mbgSQ?si=wRmV4_DoEWfsVzc4)* showing as the selection.

As Wilson watched, the flickering darkness with the distant light of the system's star gave the barest of illumination to the rocks around him.  Gently, from the earphones he heard the start of a bass rift that was joined by the high pitched but descending sounds of a haunting pedal steel guitar.

A singer with a rough-edged voice crooned out, ""*This is the la-a-a-ast mornin', that I wake up in this dirty city, lookin' for the sunshine as the buildings block the sky... This is the la-a-a-ast mornin' that I wash in rusty water, tryin' to shave a face that I don't even recognize....*""

Wilson saw an area of the fore of the Drasalite ship being crushed between two huge hunks of rocky asteroids; plasma fire and explosions blossoming in a detached way from the slow music in his ears.  There was nothing he could do to accelerate or hamper things on that ship now.

As the music continued, a rhythm guitar and gentle percussion entered with the next verse as the steel guitar continued to slide in high mournful sounds, ""*Down the hallway rats are skitterin', I can smell the garbage rottin'. I can hear the children cryin' in apartments... down below. This is the la-a-a-ast mornin' that I'm gonna have to listen to it... I'm goin' ho-ome!*""

Wilson's breath choked as he comprehended the words. Home.  He wanted to be with his daughters.  He knew he wouldn't be, but...

The music subtly sped up, as all good train songs do, ""*This is the la-a-a-ast mornin' that I try to breathe the heavy air, fight the crowds, avoid the traffic, watch the world turn gra-a-ay.*""

Grey. Wilson blinked. In the dim light of the distant star and the small, fading, explosions of rocks hitting the Drasalite hulk, things did seem to be going grey.  Blood loss, right?

""*This is the la-a-a-ast mornin' that I drink my coffee standin' up, smile and speak to strangers who just turn and walk away...*""

Wilson's last coffee was with Chilly. Not a stranger.  Chilly cared.  She'd watch out for his girls.  So would Henry.  And Vicki.  As mournful as the song was, Wilson knew he was surrounded by friends.  Literally, in the case of Liz.  In his dry raspy voice, he whispered, ""Liz...""

The soft, velvety voice answered, ""Right here. I'm right here with you.""

The song continued, however, the singer belting out, ""*This is the tough, cold city here, and I guess I'll never cut it here, and I'm so tired of tryin' to stand against it .. all alone ...*""

Wilson's cracked lips smiled despite himself. He wasn't alone.  Dying?  Sure, but... not alone...  As long as a Trooper was serving they were never alone.  Somewhere, there were Troopers fighting, ultimately to support and save him.

""*This is the la-a-a-ast mornin' that I'm gonna have to fight it! I'm goin' ho-ome!*"" The tempo increased again, and more instruments joined, as those already playing increased their volume, ""*This is the la-a-a-ast mornin' that I wear these greasy overalls, punch the clock and do just what I'm told to get along... And face the lo-o-ong evenin' lying close beside my radio, imaginin' the kisses of the girl who sings the song....*""

Wilson's eyelids fluttered closed.  When had he last kissed anyone?  He should have kissed Liz before suiting up on the Enola Gay. It wouldn't have felt the same, but he would have felt better now if he had. 

The single word, ""Sorry..."" escaped Wilson's cracked lips in a quiet, raspy, whisper.

""*Down below, the subway's screamin', as I lie here halfway dreamin', lookin' at the ceilin' wonderin' wher-er-e the dream went wro-o-ong...*""

""Never apologize to me, Rutherford...""  Over the music, Liz's sultry words were quiet and soothing.

""*This is the la-a-a-ast mornin' that I'm gonna have to think about it... I'm goin' ho-ome!*""

-=-=-=-=-=-

""No! No, no, no, no, no!"" Vicki's voice rang out as a dot of bright, vibrant yellow started to blink on the main viewscreen, superimposed over all of the suddenly red/0% outputs from Wilson's powered armor.  ""Liz's emergency beacon is going off, and we've lost all other output!""

1i2b2dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i2b2dz/aita_bday_ruined_work_va/,AITA? Bday ruined @ Work [VA],"Yesterday was my birthday & I had to go into work. I woke up in a good mood, excited for the day. I even did my hair & makeup and wore my favorite outfit. Once I got to work, I made sure I went to get my free coffee and free chickfil a breakfast. 

Right when I came back into the office, that’s when it all changed. I get snapped at by one manager for “bothering him before he could even clock in” because a client needed his help. But okay whatever, not a big deal. Then I hear that an older MAN lol was talking shit about me & how I “only send emails”, which is far from the truth… I am a huge asset to this company. But once again, whatever, I ignore it. 
Then some other co-workers around me become loud & start having conversations from across the room, disrupting everyone. This was happening while I was making phone calls to clients… I kindly ask my manager if I could sit in an ACTUAL office (bc of course half of us don’t have one due to the lack of space this building has). I just wanted to get through my calls with some quietness & be able to focus. I was told “No. this is something you have to get used to, no one gets special treatment here.” Which is also NOT true, there are many who get special treatment. He could have just said yes or no but instead was just rude (which was upsetting due to the fact the day before I opened up to him about my struggles with anxiety - thinking I could trust him & he would maybe understand why I’ve been struggling to get to work on time. 
THEN… here’s the kicker. I was eating lunch with 2 co-workers when one said “they better get you a cake because they do this for everybody.” & the other said “we should ask the managers.” I responded by saying that it would be cool because I didn’t get one last year & that I wanted one. The one that said they should ask the managers did ask & he comes back to me & says that they all laughed in his face & was told “if she wants one then she needs to ask herself” and proceeded to laugh & essentially make fun of me because I wanted a cake. GOD FORBID SOMEONE WANTS A CAKE ON THEIR BDAY. They have never said that about anyone else. & after this, once again, another older man started talking shit about me. 

I guess one of the managers gave my coworker some money to get a cake but at this point I didn’t want it. I truly was so over everything & just wanted to get through the rest of the day and go home. But of course, they get the cake & sing me happy birthday & i just wasn’t happy. This is just the last straw for me. Almost every other day, there’s always something going on & I am just miserable. But they treat me (and most of the women) like spoiled brats who don’t matter in this industry. 
Am I acting spoiled or am I valid in feeling this way?",2,1736983840.0,AmItheAsshole,4,1.0,False

**Sean woke up from his coma after four months with an insatiable hunger for food. The first thing out of his mouth to the nurse was “french fries”. He was forty-two years old and he was awake. It was a car collision that involved him and another fellow. He had run a red light during the wee hours of the night on a busy city street, crashing into the other man on the passenger side, not harming him. The unfortunate part was that he was left paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his natural life. He had been awake for four days by the time he had gotten any visits while in the hospital.**

**He was sitting up eating a bowl of ice cream and looking down at his legs.**

**“So, for now, you’re going to be staying at an assisted living home. Because the accident was ruled as your fault, your insurance isn’t compensating for the accident. You will be relying on the government disability act until or if you even can go back to work. Get it?”**

**“I get it. I’m a bum now until I show them I can still handle work requirements. Simply put, I’m fucked. I can’t operate the machinery at the plant anymore, so I’ll be waiting for a monthly payoff of peanuts for the rest of my shitty life. I get it, Mark. Who sent you anyway?”**

**“John did because he knows you’re my brother-in-law so he figured…”**

**“He figured he could pass the job of telling me to you.** 

**“I guess.”**

**“Well, it’s done then. Thanks for coming by.”**

**“No problem. The doctor said that you’ll be okay to leave after they’ve rendered you capable.”**

**“Cool. I hate this hospital. The only thing that’s good about this place is the desserts. The nurses here are dogs. Have you seen them? They're a bunch of mutts.”**

**“Sean, leave it to you to say something vulgar like that.”**

**“Hey, nothing's wrong with my libido, brother.”**

**“So, do you need anything else?”**

**“Ya, get me some Mars bars from the Canteen, will ya?”**

**“Done deal. Then I have to leave. Busy weekend for us, you know how it is.”**

**“No, I don’t but I am sympathetic to you. Spend time with my sister and be good to her, eh?”**

**“Always, Sean.”**

**When Sean was finally alone, he had time to contemplate just what had occurred. All he could remember about the accident was leaving the bar. He had been drinking at Al’s all evening hitting on a woman who frequented there often but would never give in to his advances. Lee was her name and she always played hard to get with Sean. On the evenings that they would run into each other, she would ask him to play a game of pool with her, always accepting the drink he would offer to buy. Vodka and seven on ice was her drink and he never got it wrong. He would let her win every game, being as pleasant as he could in his efforts to lay her. She was his type and he just loved the way she laughed. But she was a player and the method to her madness was to get free drinks from the bachelors. It worked quite well for her when she stuck to the dive bars around town.**

**On those nights, including the night of the crash, he would leave the bar alone. And that is all he remembered about that night, drinking and playing pool with Lee, getting cut off for the night by the bartender, and getting in his car to drive home. The accident itself failed to be conscious in his mind.**

**Sean kept trying to jog his memory of that night but nothing ever stood out as a clear memory. It all fell into place as just another night at the bar in his mind and nothing more.**

**But he knew that this wasn’t the case as he tried to move his legs at all. The injuries that he took away from the accident were a broken left wrist, a broken neck, some minor cuts and bruises, and a chipped tooth. When he spoke to the doctor, he said that they were hoping in time that he may regain some of the feelings in his legs but he would never walk again. Every time he thought about this he got depressed, staying with him the whole time he was in the hospital.**

**On discharge day, he was so revved up to get going, that he couldn’t keep his hands still. He would use the phone, then flick the channels on the television, or scribble notes on paper that were relatively meaningless.**

**Anything to keep him occupied.**

**“Mr. Vader, are you ready to leave? Have they given you your belongings yet?”**

**“I think so. Yes. I am geeked to get out of here, that’s for sure”**

**“Good. The chair is yours until you get your real chair. I’ll wheel you downstairs where there will be a cab coming for you soon. All set?”**

**“I guess,” Sean said listlessly.**

**The cab was already waiting there by the time they got to the entrance. He was helped in and quickly dropped off at the Helping Hands Assisted Living Institution on the other side of the city. The occupational nurse at the hospital showed Sean how to leverage his weight and get himself in and out of the chair to do practical duties. He was still very new to it, so it took him time to get from one position to the next.**

**He sat in front of the home taking it in that he was dependent on others from now on to get around and perform certain tasks. Sean wasn’t the type to rely on people, so it was very difficult for him to accept this fate. He took a mental image of the building and pushed his way through the door and to the front desk.**

**Right away, he was greeted by a nurse in a loose-fitting uniform, who introduced herself as Patricia. They exchanged greetings, and he was shown to his room. He would remember her name by relating it to her toothy smile. He liked her right away and told himself to ask her if he ever needed anything.**

**He sat in the wheelchair, staring around the room at his shared situation. The room consisted of two beds, two dressers, two end tables, and a television mounted on the wall. His bed was located beside the window labeled on the headboard as “205B. 205A was empty it seemed so for the time being he had the room to himself. All in all the room was pleasant with two very large paintings of scenery and wall-to-wall carpeting in burgundy to add to the decor.** 

**Sean wheeled around the room, taking it all in, noticing the central air and ensuite bathroom. About five minutes into this the loudspeaker from the hall went off with a voice from administration.**

**“To all residents… dinner will be served at four-thirty pm. Please feel free to utilize our coffee and tea service. Thanks.”**

**Sean checked his watch which said four-twelve pm. That gave him time to wheel himself to the elevator and discover the dining room on the first floor. He could feel his arms burning from the weight as he approached the elevator. Just as he was arriving at the doors, they opened. He saw it was Patricia again but he froze in shock when she exited the doors. Her face was a mess of decay and rot, her cheeks hanging and her teeth exposed. One of her eyes was missing and she had no tongue. She tried to say something to him but it only came out as a garbled retching at him. He yelped and pushed himself back in terror. She walked right by him and turned her face away. For a moment he just sat there, and when he turned himself around to look once again, she was normal. Her face wasn’t grotesque anymore. She smiled at him with a fresh face, eyes bright and cheery. He forced a small back and got himself on the elevator, completely indifferent to what had just happened.**

**He was breathing heavily as the elevator took him from the second floor to the first, unable to process what he had just seen.**

**“You’re hallucinating now too buddy. Get a grip. It’s probably one of my medications that’s doing this to me.”**

**Once out of the noisy elevator, he entered the large cafeteria-style area where people were lined up to two servers that doled out food at the back of the room. Sean took his place at the back of the line and waited his turn. There were about fourteen people ahead of him and he figured it would be awhile before he set down to eat. He fixed his gaze on everyone already seated. There were all different types of characters eating their meals at the tables. He was eager to see what kind of food they served at the establishment he was now a part of.**

**He started to think about Patricia and how her face had changed. He just couldn’t figure out how his mind could trick him like that. When it was his turn to pick out his food he was impressed. He had choices of two different dishes and he picked the pasta and salad for himself, along with a glass of milk and coffee. They even had a fruit cup for dessert but he passed it by. He sat down at a table where there was only one other person seated. It was a man in his forties who looked rather thin and sinewy in appearance. He had a five o’clock shadow and no front teeth to chew with. Every time he closed his jaw to chew it looked as though half of his face disappeared. Sean almost giggled at the sight of this but looked down at his place to distract himself.**

**He began to eat his pasta with a traditional fork and spoon, circling the pasta around until he had a full bite ready when someone yelled out loud something he couldn’t quite understand. He looked up from his plate but could see no one in distress. Just then, two attendants raced over to a woman at another table to the left of him who seemed to be choking. It was the man sitting next to her that had yelled out for help.**

 **When Sean looked back at his plate, he jumped back in his seat, horrified. On his plate, instead of spaghetti, was a pile of pinkish-purple worms, wriggling and sliding about. He yelped out loud and the whole room stopped and stared at him. He tried to stand up, forgetting his disability, only causing him to ram his back more into the seat of the wheelchair. The room was silent for a few seconds before he looked back down at the plate. When he did, it was only spaghetti again. Sean was perplexed.**

**“My spaghetti just turned into worms on my plate! And now it's spaghetti again! I swear it was…” his voice trailing away the more ridiculous he sounded as he went on.**

**He looked over at the man who looked at Sean as though he were crazy and said, “Sorry. My bad. I made a mistake, that's all.”**

**Slowly the room returned to the clanging of utensils and dishware and small talk. Sean was relieved to have the attention pulled away from him then. But the man still stared at him intently, making Sean feel like an oddball. Sean suddenly lost his appetite.**

**“Funny how things can happen the way they do, wouldn’t you say?”**

**“I’d say.”**

**“You’re new here. My name’s Albert. Yours?**

**“Sean.”**

**“Nice to meet you, Sean. How’d you end up in the chair?”**

**“Car accident.”**

**“Oh. I see. Was the other guy hurt?”**

**“No. Just me.”**

**“Hmmm. Are you gonna eat your food?”**

**“No. My stomach’s a little nervous. Go ahead.”**

**“Thanks.”**

**Immediately, Albert grabbed Sean’s plate and pushed the contents with his fork onto his plate. He proceeded to shovel in the food in large bites, grossing Sean out even more. He started to talk through his food and that was when Sean found his time to exit. He was wheeling away regardless of what anyone thought when he heard someone say behind him, “You can run but it will always be there lurking inside of you somewhere, fella.”**

**Sean jerked his head to the left and right and saw no one. Then he circled and saw a tiny lady with white hair in a bun staring right at him. She was smiling but it was a sad smile. When they exchanged glances she nodded her head to signify it was her that said it. He looked at her with wonder in his eyes when she turned and walked away down another hall. Sean was left there wondering what the hell she meant by that. He sat there for a moment, less amused and more bothered, before he left the dining hall. He returned to his room to relieve himself, unpack his belongings, and then sleep for the night.**

**But things took a turn when he came across a twenty-sixer of vodka that his brother-in-law must have snuck in there on his visit. He immediately downed three gulps from it, relieved by its effect on him. He was an alcoholic and he knew it. If he was going to let other people he knew in on his secret was another story. He decided that from now on only he would know about how much he drank and when.**

**Taking a fourth gulp, he began to think about what a weird day it had turned out to be his first day at the home. He was seeing and hearing things that were peculiar on a low note and he couldn’t figure out what would have caused those hallucinations. He chalked it up to stress and nothing more after pondering it most of the evening before going to bed.** 

**The bed wasn’t super comfortable but it would do for him. As he was falling asleep, he thought about his future and what it was supposed to be like living without the use of his legs. He told himself that he wouldn’t stay depressed and that he would keep fighting no matter what. Things were the way they were and he had to accept this no matter how shitty it seemed to him. He drifted off finally, drunk and exhausted.**

	**Morning came too soon for Sean, waking him with the gleam of the sun on his face. His mouth felt like cotton balls and he had to pee badly. He lifted himself to his chair like they showed him and adjusted his legs. His hangover was screaming in his head and he was shaking a bit as he flushed the toilet. In order to see his reflection in the mirror he had to sit back near the toilet, and he was alarmed at what he saw there. His face was gaunt and he was greying on the sides prematurely.**

	**“I guess I wasn’t paying very much attention to my looks before the accident. Either I was lying to myself, or the accident did this to me.”**

**He looked from side to side at himself, hoping to catch a good image but there was none. He looked like shit and he knew it.**

	**Sean began the day with some good self-talk and he thought it was actually working when the loudspeaker came on again for breakfast.**

	**He quickly washed his face, brushed, and got dressed to go down when there was a knock at the door. He wheeled over and opened it, but there was no one standing there. He looked down the hall both ways and it was empty. He shrugged his shoulders and went to grab his room key when someone else was at the door. Only this time it was a thunderous banging that he heard.**

**“Just a minute,” he called, racing to the door once again to find again, no one there,**

**“Very funny. What the fuck do you want?”**

**Again, no one was in the hall.**

**“Whatever.”**

**Sean tried to put it all out of his mind and raced to the elevator. He pushed the down button, noticing that calluses were beginning on his hands from the intense use of them with the wheelchair. He kept turning his head as far as he could see behind him, not liking the limitations he had as a disabled. He got himself on the elevator and had lunch without saying a word, paying his mind to everything around him. His breakfast went uneventful.**

**After eating, he decided that he would have a drink with himself just because he could. He dismissed the fact that it wasn't even eleven o’clock yet, rationalizing it and believing that he was under stress and deserved it. It was something he often did to accept his behaviors.**

**He poured himself a strong drink, using the paper cups from the bathroom. He drank it down in two gulps, disliking the taste, but loving its effects.**

**By noon, he finished the bottle and was feeling pretty buzzed from the vodka. He told himself he was going to have to make a trip to the liquor store soon. How he was going to do this he didn’t know yet. He had skipped lunch and his stomach burned pretty bad by one o’clock.** 

**He decided he was going to have a shower, located right next door to where his room was. He got his towels and soap together and put them on his lap to check if it was vacant, and when he saw that it was, he dashed in. The shower was clean, and there was a shower chair for him to utilize, so he took advantage of it. The hot shower felt good on his skin. He let the water fall onto him, trying to drain away the stress of what had happened to him. He was forever changed and he had to face it.**

**As he returned to his room, his mind was flooded with the idea of getting more alcohol. He didn’t know anyone there yet to ask them to pick it up for him and he didn’t want others to know he drank anyhow, so he came up with the idea that he would take a taxi and have the driver purchase it for him. It was really his only alternative in his situation.**

**So, he took his phone with him and waited out front after calling for the cab. It was a nice day and he didn’t need a jacket but he wore it anyway so he could disguise the bottle in it.**

**The cab came fast and agreed to go in for him, receiving a five-dollar tip for his efforts. Sean was having a nice afternoon, or so he thought.**

**When he got back to his room there was another knock at the door. This time, there was someone there.**

**“Hello. Remember me? I’m the guy who sat with you yesterday at dinner. Ring a bell?”**

**“Ya, I remember you. What’s up?”**

**I was wanting to ask you if you would like to come over to my room for coffee?”**

**“I was just about to lay down, maybe another…”**

**“Listen, I don’t have many friends and I am sure you want to find out some things about this place. What d’ya say?”**

**“Thanks but…”**

**“Then, can I come in for a drink? I can see your whiskey bottle poking out of your vest, Sean.”**

**“You’re serious?”**

**“Just one drink and I’ll go.”**

**“All right then, I guess.”**

**Sean opened the door just enough to let the man slip into the room, quietly. He immediately took off his jacket and sat on the empty bed that said 205A on the headboard. Sean sat directly across from him on his own bed.**

**“Thank you kindly, I really appreciate your hospitality.”**

**“It’s alright,” returned.**

**“This is your second time here, am I right?”**

**“Yes, and how did you know my name? I never told you who I was.”**

**“Oh, information travels fast around here. Besides, I’m good at guessing names. Ya believe me?”**

**“I guess. It’s Albert, right?”**

**“Albert it is. Now for that drink?”**

**“You don’t hesitate do you,” Sean said cynically.**

**“I try to stay in the moment.”**

**Sean poured two drinks into paper cups and handed him one.** 

**“There you go. So, what interesting things do you know about this place,” he asked.**

**“Oh, only the important things. Do you have any questions for me?”**

**“Not really. This place seems to be pretty straightforward if you ask me.”**

**“I wouldn’t say that about this place. It had its secrets, you know.”**

**“What kind of secrets?”**

**“Well, I’ll explain a bit about the ways things happen around here,” he said, sipping his drink and flinching. “I’ll begin with the people. Everyone here is paying a price for things they have done in the past. Let’s say that it isn’t much more than a central station where people are sent to that have done things. There are no bars on the windows or locks on the doors… and you can come and go as you please, but… it’s a kind of existential hell here, you see. You can leave any time you want, but where are you really gonna go? And there are other things going on inside these walls. Supernatural things. They are to make you see the wrongs of your ways, in so many words. There are lessons to be learned here.”**

**“What are you saying? That this place has ghosts or something?”**

**“Not exactly. You’ll see in no time.”**

**“I’ve already experienced a few weird things. Am I a target or something?”**

**“Everyone here is targeted. We all have things to learn before we can leave here.”**

**“And what if you don’t learn anything?”**

**“Then you don’t leave.”**

**“What you’re saying is interesting and all, but I think you’re talking out your ass. Apologies.”**

**“None needed, but I think you should mind what's going on around here. It’s in your best interests.”**

**Albert downed the last of his drink and stood up to leave.**

**“Thanks for your words, but I’ll be fine.”**

**“I hope so. Keep your eyes and ears peeled if you know what’s good for ya.”**

**“I will, and thank you.”**

**“See you on the flip side, friend,” Albert stated, leaving the room just as silently as he entered.**

**Sean just sat there, ingesting what the man had just spoken. He thought the man was off-kilter with the jargon he told to him. Just then, the loudspeaker came on and stated, ”We apologize to say that the elevator will be out of use until tomorrow morning. Your meals will be dropped off at your room door at regularly scheduled times. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you.”**

**“Just perfect,” Sean exclaimed to himself. “I didn’t want to leave the room anyhow.”**

**He went to the bathroom to pee and this time he avoided looking at himself in the mirror. He knew he didn’t look good and his day was already scrambled enough.**

**Sean flushed the toilet and wheeled back to the room where he poured another drink, gulping it empty in one gulp. He put the paper cup back on the end table and tilted his head back, closing his eyes to think. When he opened them the room had changed.**

**The walls were wet and the color of blood, shiny. The room was empty of all furniture as well, with just him in his chair. He looked at the door that was also red and yelled out, “What the fuck is going on?!”**

**Just then, the walls began to pulsate in and out as if they were breathing, The noise of wood creaking in his ears. He stayed silent after that, watching and listening to the walls crying out, only closing his eyes in absolute horror. The creaking sound bellowed loud and fierce, creating a scrunched look on his face.**

**When he opened his eyes, which seemed like an eternity, everything was back to normal. The beds and walls were the same, and there was only the sound of the toilet’s running water. He breathed a sigh of relief, wiping the sweat from his upper lip.**

**“What the fuck is wrong with me,” he whispered to himself. “I must be going crazy or something. Holy fuck. What** ***is*** **this place?”**

**He checked his watch and it said four-thirty. They would be coming around with his dinner soon, and if he wanted another bottle he would have to get it after they served him. He decided to rest for a bit on his bed, remembering the luxury of driving his car to work and to the bar every day. A single tear soaked his pillow while he was feeling sorry for himself. Just as he was about to drift off, someone knocked at the door with three sharp bangs.**

**He got out of bed as fast as he could and sped for the door in his wheelchair, he was so hungry. When he answered it, there was a figure before him that he took to be male because of the uniform, but he had no face. All that was there was an oval head with short dark hair. Where the eyes, nose, and mouth should have been, it was only smooth skin.**

**“Rrrhmmmrrffffssstt,” it said.**

**“Aaahhhh,” Sean yelled in return. Rrr Hmmm Rrfff Mmmnnnmmnnn.”**

**Sean slammed the door so hard, that his baseball hat that was hooked on the inside came off and fell to the carpet. Then the knocking came again, even harder this time. Sean was reluctant to answer the door, but in his panic, he knew he had to. Someone or something was on the other side of that door but that was his only way in and out.**

**He turned the knob slowly and pulled the door back a few inches and peeked through the crack.**

	**“Mr. Limly, I have your dinner here. If you don’t want it, all you have to do is tell me.”**

**Sean opened the door ever so slowly to meet the man with his dinner. This time he had a normal face with all his features. He looked and sounded to be of Spadescentecent.**

**“I’ll just take it then.”**

**“It’s pasta with a small salad and apple pie. And, a juice box. It’s all there.”**

**“Thank you so kindly,” Sean spoke quietly. “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what’s come over me.”problemroble, Mr. Limly. We all have our days.”**

**Sean closed the door softly and put his meal on a tray on the end table as well. He knew he had to eat so he forced the pasta down, wondering what could be wrong with him. As he was finishing, he came to the conclusion that it was the Dt’s that he was experiencing and nothing more. A simple explanation for a complex situation.**

**After his meal, he decided to call another cab to buy more whiskey. The trip to the liquor store unfolded without problem and he was once again, back in his room, ready to crack the bottle.**

**He got himself a drink and gulped it down straight away, pouring another to ease the tension he felt in the small room. He gulped the second one grimacing at its bitter strength. He breathed out the heat from the whiskey through his mouth, pouring a third,  settling down a bit.**

**“I’m going fucking nuts and I’ve only been here three days damned it! What is** ***wrong*** **with me?!”**

**“I’ll tell you what’s wrong with you. You’re having hallucinations, Sean. The kind of hallucinations that try to tell you something. Get it?”**

**He looked over to the left at the floor where the voice was coming from and only saw the central air vent. That wasn’t what was talking to him, was it?**

**“I am here to show you things about yourself, Sean. You are here to face what you have done wrong, Do you know what you have done wrong?”**

**“I am not talking to the heater vent. Who’s doing this to me? Are you the people next door trying to make me thi'nk I’m crazy?! I bet you are. Well, I’m not falling for it for one second, you hear me? It's not not your neighbor, Sean. It’s more than that and you need to listen carefully to what I have to say.”**

**“I don’t have to listen to shit.”**

**“Yes, you do, and you will.”**

**“Says who? And you can’t stop me from saying what I have to say. I mean, who’s going to believe that there are voices coming from the vent, Sean? Who would believe you?”**

**“I don’t care. I’ll block you out.”**

**“How?”**

**“I’ll… put on some music really loud.”**

**“You’ll still hear me.”**

**“Will I, now?”**

**Sean grabbed for his phone and found a playlist of downloaded country songs and hit the play button. Hank William Jr. began to bellow from the cell phone, raspy from having it on full blast. He was singing about country boys surviving… Sean listened for the voice.**

**“I’m still here.”**

**Sean heard the manly voice as clear as a bell in his head.**

**“Damn. What do you want from me?!”**

**“I want to tell you something.”**

**“There is nothing for me to learn about the accident. It’s done and so am I. I have no life now.”**

**“I am not talking about your current situation, Sean. What were you doing five winters ago, can you remember?”**

**“I can’t even remember two years ago. I was probably working. So what?”**

**“So, five winters ago you did something. Something really bad. Do you recall what it is?”**

**“I am not a bad person. I think you have someone else.”**

**“ No, I'm sure I have the right man. Sean, you are a murderer.”**

**“I have never laid a hand on anyone in my life. I am a nonviolent person. I don’t even like confrontation.”**

**“I can see that, but you like to drink, don’t you?”**

**There was another knock at the door. Sean answered it, hoping that they could explain the voice from the vent. He felt hysterically hopeful.**

**“Mr. Limly, could you please keep your music down a bit? Other people are complaining that it’s too loud. You wouldn’t mind, would you?”**

**“No problem, but could you come in for a minute? I want you to take a look at something.”**

**“Sure. No problem, but it has to be quick. I am a busy lady.”**

**“What’s your name?”** 

**“Veronica, but everyone calls me Vicky”**

**Listen, Vicky, come over here for a second. I want you to just listen to this vent. It’s been saying things to me and I want you to hear it for yourself. I know it sounds crazy, but…”**

**“You’re probably just hearing people from other rooms talking. But, I’ll humor you,” she said smiling. She was a young and pretty twenty-three year-old Chinese woman who really did not have the time for him but obliged Sean.**

**Vicky walked over to the vent and noticed the open bottle on the nightstand, and quickly made her judgment before she could listen to anything.**

**“Mr. Limly, have you been drinking?. You know we have a policy here that there should be no intoxicated behaviors going on…”**

**“I am not drunk. Just listen now.”**

**“She can’t hear me like you do, Sean,” the voice spoke.**

**“There! You see?! You heard it, right?”**

**“No, I can't hear anything. I think you may just need some more rest. The accident left you…”**

**“*****Fuck*** **the accident. Are you telling me you didn’t hear that?”**

**“I am telling you I can’t hear anything come from the vent. Now…”**

**“Well, fuck you then! You’re just lying to me to make me think I’m crazy. Well, I’m not!”**

**“Mr. Limly…**

**“Just get out!”**

**“I am reporting your intolerable behavior. You can talk to management about it all. Goodbye.”**

**Vicky left quietly but upset. Sean sat in the chair, still staring at the grate in unbelief.**

**“I can’t fucking believe this! What do you want from me? And why are you talking to me in fashion? If I have done something wrong you can say it to my face. You don’t have to play games.”**

**“This is not a game.”**

**“Then show yourself.”**

**“I am speaking to you in this manner because you** ***are*** **insane, Sean. Nothing is going to be the same from now on. I guess I should tell you why you went insane, shouldn’t I now?”**

**“Yes! But I am not crazy,”**

**“Oh yes you are. Or at least you will be. This is only the beginning. Five winters ago, you were driving home drunk and you hit someone. You hit them with your car while you were drunk, and killed them. It was a woman on her way home from work, walking in the snow, crossing on a side street, and you hit her. Hard enough to kill her Sean. And when you saw what you did, you took off. Do you remember any of this?”**

**Sean wheeled over to the nightstand and pounded the drink down, pouring a fourth. He looked over at the vent and tried to rack his brain to recall anything like what the voice said. He could not. He just sat there, perplexed**

**“Think back on it. You must surely know something about the hit and run.”**

**“I didn’t hit ANYONE!”**

**“You most surely did.”**

**Sean began to cry then. He sobbed loudly, knowing deep in his core that it could have been possible. He had driven home so many times in a blackout that it could be possible that he hit someone and just wasn’t aware of it.**

**“Did I hit someone,” he asked softly.**

**“Yes, you did. Why do you think you are paralyzed, Sean? Being in that chair is the karma you are receiving from the murder you committed. It was your fate and now you must live with this.”**

**“Who knows about this?”**

**“Just you and us.”**

**“Who are you?”**

**“It is none of your business who we are, Sean. That’s not the point. What you have done you are paying for with your body and your sanity.”**

**“But I didn’t do it on purpose,” Sean whined.**

**“You must still pay the price.”**

**“What’s going to happen to me?”**

**“Where you are, you will experience things fitting to what you have done. We will be back in a very short time. For now, we will simply let you feel the weight of what you have done.”**

**Sean collapsed onto the floor next to the grate, fingering the steel while his nose ran snot onto the carpet.**

**“I’m sorry! I’m so sorry,” he whined so loud that there was another knock at the door not long after.**

**Sean didn’t answer this time and the attendant waited minutes until finally entering the room with a main key. What Vicky saw was startling.**

**She found the new resident sprawled on the floor, lying in his own urine, drooling all over himself. His hair was completely white as he stared up at the ceiling repeating to himself, “I’m sorry,,, I’m sorry…”**

**She left the room and went to the nurse’s station, where Nurse Angela was working as head nurse for the shift. Right away Vicky said sarcastically, “We got another one feeling sorry for himself. Why do they always send us the ones who are still in the realization stage? Why can’t they ship us the ones who are at a level of repentance that’s more respectful? We always get the sloppy ones who are still practicing their sins… I need a vacation.”**

**“I agree,” Vicly returned. “But, we have a job to do here. Prepare them for either ascension or condemnation. Where do you think this one’s  going?”**

**“No clue just yet. We’ll bide our time and see, I guess. Call the paramedics. This one will be seeing psychiatry for a while before we plant anything more on him.”**

**“Another day ay Helping Hands…”**

I started dating again 1.5 years ago, and the dating landscape has completely changed. Separately, I often feel a cognitive dissonance, where I sometimes feel very young and very old. 

For instance, wrapping my head around the fact that I could and should be open to dating someone in their early fifties has taken a long time - though I have only gotten to the talking stages to men in this age range. I've started to check older men out when I'm out and vice versa, but I also assume that most older men in the wild are married. That's alright with me, I'm still getting comfortable with making eye contact in a way that demonstrates interest, though there was this one guy...

In general, I more often get approached by younger men. It's obviously a whole fetish, which makes me hesitate to give younger men a chance. In this instance, despite being a very active athlete, I feel really old. I went out on a coffee date with a 36-year-old and felt extremely old, partially because he seemed to be glancing at the handful of stress-induced gray hairs I have (though I did go out on a date with a 31-year-old last year, and felt less so). Still, when I receive a like or a message from anyone younger than 38, I just can't get myself to feel comfortable with it. I have never dated anyone where there was a huge age gap, so it's definitely on me. Meanwhile, my friend is dating someone 11 years younger without hesitation. How?

Has anyone felt this way? How do you work through it? I would like to expand my age range.

I recently had an appointment with my PCP in which I requested a referral to a sleep doctor, but she was pretty dismissive. Tale as old as time. I insisted, even if not narcolepsy, I know that there is something going on, and she said she’d refer me to something she called a sleep hygienist. I have no clue what that is, but I’m assuming it’s one of many hoops I’m going to have to jump through to figure out what is going on. So my question is this: what information do I need to bring to a sleep hygienist to reduce this back and forth? Should I track the hours of sleep I’m getting each night or my caffeine intake? Has anyone else been to a sleep hygienist? Like how can I prove the issue is not screens before bed or a cup of coffee after noon?

I’m looking for an app to help me cut down on vaping initially with the goal of quitting eventually. I’m thinking something like a start and stop counting clock to keep track of how long I go without it, with the intention of increasing the length of time in between uses.

I tried using the cold turkey quitting apps when I was a full time cigarette smoker, and found that what helped me in the end was stopping slowly by cutting down over time to the point where I could go weeks without one. I would still get cravings occasionally but the further away I got from it, the easier it was to dislike it and find it unappealing. Some of the hardest parts of kicking my cigarette addiction included the habit of rolling, and the rituals (coffee and cigarette, stuff like that). Granted, I did start consuming nicotine through a vape during this time, which started off occasionally treating it as a cigarette (going outside, only using socially). But now this addiction has formed its own problem in my life and I would really like to cut this down, and hopefully finally stop.

For context, I used to consume above 600mg caffeine each day (in caffeine pills) once I realized coffee wasn't as effective anymore. Although such a dose is not recommended, I've been doing this for about a year. This seemed to keep me feeling normal and energized at school and other environments. Three weeks ago, however, I decided to stop taking it randomly and I haven't taken it since. I just returned to school after break and I feel exhausted after the easiest days, no matter the amount of work I had to do.  
  
This destroyed my motivation, energy, and I haven't wanted to talk to anyone at school which has never happened. I simply have no motivation or desire to do the things I enjoyed. I believe I used to have a lot of fatigue, which is what prompted me to begin taking it once I realized taking it in higher doses helped. This is most likely unrelated to my sleep considering I am sleeping way more than I did before break, although I know sleep is one of the biggest factors for fatigue.

The world is our oyster and you (yes you, random Redditor) get to call the shots.

A. Do you choose to stay in the URC or go back to Super Rugby? Do you turn the world on it's head and convince the Top14 to join forces? Noting is off the table, gooi - JRLO? MLR? British Prem (LOLsies)?

B. Do you negotiate with the inventor for a sizable portion of the future teleportation business profits (sweetening the deal with Faf's haircare secrets and Eben's help moving furniture), and use the money to establish a completely new international club league? Who do you include?

C. Do you use the money to once again return the hallowed Currie Cup to it's rightful place as THE SUPREME CLUB RUGBY COMPETITION OF THE WORLD?

See where I’m going with this? Sue Bird recently reinforced the same notion on her A Touch More podcast with Megan Rapinoe, and she added a bit more color to it. Here’s what she said (See the 28:20 mark of the YouTube video.):

“Oh my God. There’s going to be so many superteams formed in Unrivaled. The WNBA free agency chatter that must be happening—in the training room, when they’re out shopping, when they’re getting some coffee—has gotta be next level…”

“Now they’re together for, like, two months during WNBA free agency. So, the level of recruiting—I can only imagine.”",58,1736982811.0,wnba,15,0.97,False

It only really saves me a minute or so away from my desk but I’ve always seen it as a “no harm, no foul” situation. I always wipe the seat and use a toilet brush if needed and by no means do I ever leave it in a worse condition than when I entered. 
Been doing it for over a year and never an issue flagged until last week when I responded to an emergency call while in there so I left to go sort it out and absentmindedly left my flashlight, ID card and an almost empty takeaway coffee cup on the shelf just inside. 
I finished out my shift and the morning staff had arrived and I getting ready to leave when I realised I was missing the items. Knowing exactly were they were I asked one of the girls now in the office if she would retrieve them for me. She did so and didn’t even question why they were in there or in anyway seem “off” with me. 
When I woke up that afternoon I had an abrupt email from a manager that I’m not to be using the ladies toilets even when I’m alone in the building and now the toilet doors have an obnoxiously large sharpie sign with “LADIES ONLY - NO MEN”

Right before I made the decision to leave, which I now refer to as my ""midlife crisis,"" my boyfriend (26M) didn’t think it was the best idea. However, he told me he would support me no matter what I chose to do.

Earlier that year, I was involved in a hit-and-run accident where another car hit mine and fled. My car was totaled, and I had to go a few months without one. During that time, my boyfriend lent me $3,000 to buy a new car, which I repaid as quickly as I could because I hate being in debt to loved ones. To pay him back faster, I ended up taking out a high-interest loan (a decision I regret). While I did manage to pay him back entirely, it took longer to pay off the loan, which I just recently finished.

Since taking a break from school, I’ve been working over 40 hours a week for the past two months to save money to pay off my tuition balance. I also needed to cover the cost of a new phone (my old one broke around the time I dropped out), on top of paying off my boyfriend and the loan. However, I still don’t have enough money to pay off my remaining tuition balance of $3,000, which I need to settle in order to return to school this spring semester.

My boyfriend recently offered to help me with the tuition balance, and I agreed initially. But then he started asking why I haven’t reached out to my family for help. When I explained why, he said some hurtful things that made it seem like he thought I’ve been sitting around doing nothing for the past few months. He knows I struggle with asking for and accepting help due to past trauma, yet his messages made me feel like he was throwing his past help in my face, even though he’s always been the one to offer.

After reading what he said, I told him I would never accept any money from him again. I’ll attach the exact messages below for context. But I can’t shake the feeling that maybe I’m overreacting or in the wrong. Am I the a**hole?

“”stop making bad decisions, stop complaining and quitting, the fact that I have to cover for you again when I was begging you not to drop out in the first place, while you choose not to work 40 hrs a week in sept, oct, nov, while you waste your money on high interest loans, take out & coffee, other garbage expenses is bullshit but I am willing to do it because I love you””",4,1736982450.0,AITAH,14,0.83,False

I take a shower at 9pm, crawl into bed, read a chapter or two of whatever book I'm reading to wind down, and I'm asleep by 10pm. No devices during the wind down.  Eight hours of sleep is the ideal for me.

I started sleeping through the night and I now wake up energized instead struggling to get out of bed. I'm getting more than 4 hours a night because I'm not waking up 6 times throughout the night and struggling to go back to sleep each time. Instead of frantically driving to work in traffic because I left at the last minute due to struggling to get out of bed, I walk the 25-minute commute and do some mindfulness exercises along the way. I don't need coffee or energy drinks to get through the day, getting a big rush of energy, feeling jittery for 45 minutes, then crashing and needing another coffee to continue.

I've even lost some weight and toned up because instead of being too tired to cook and relying on quick, processed foods, I pop into the supermarket and grab fresh meat and vegetables on my walk home from work.

The problem is my fiancé still sticks to our old schedule of going to sleep whenever. Obviously, I can't stick to my schedule 100% and there's some flexibility when circumstances arise. For example, the other day was our friend's birthday party. We went to dinner with her and friends to celebrate and I told my fiancé that he can stay out as late as he wants, but I intended to say my goodbyes at around 9pm, so I didn't disrupt my sleep schedule too much (I'd be back home around 9:30). He's beginning to find episodes like this annoying and this particular time it turned into a small fight that I'm being too anal about my new lifestyle and I need to be more flexible. I feel I *am* flexible when it allows and matters and that dinner and a drink or two from 7-9pm is a perfectly acceptable way to celebrate a birthday with a friend when we all have work the next day.

It's not just my fiancé, too. Even my friends are commenting that I'm not as fun as I used to be and have started jokingly referring to me as ""Granny"" and saying things like, ""How's your 'sleep journey' going?"" and rolling their eyes.  And I've noticed I'm not really invited to much anymore (I see their outings on social media), which means my fiancé misses out, too, since they can't really invite him and not me. I feel like I'm doing this good thing for myself and everyone seems to have real problems with it.

To be fair, my fiancé has started going to bed earlier (not as early as me) and he appreciates the better, healthier food. He's even commented he has more energy and has been going to the gym more often.  He functions perfectly fine with 6 hours of sleep.  But in his mind, we're still young and this is the time for fun before we have to be ""real"" adults. He just wants some happy medium between the old me and the new me.  But I feel like my new lifestyle is working for me and I am flexible as needed.

I'm mentally happier and physically healthier than I've ever been due to the changes I've made. I'm not in college anymore, I can't party until 4am, skip class, and sleep until noon to recover. I don't want to stay out until midnight on a Monday night and struggle throughout the day at work the next day.  I don't want to go to work hungover because friends want to party on a random Wednesday and I don't want a slippery slope where I fall back into bad habits.

Is it really that horrible that I'm trying to be a responsible adult and sticking to my choices, even if it makes me too boring to deal with?",4,1736982292.0,relationship_advice,16,0.83,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I got the bambino plus and barazta. After a month of using it i can't seem to dial it in. I was able to realize the  extraction comes close to dialed in when my grind setting is between 19 to 20. I'm using Tony's medium roast cafe Carmelita coffee beans.

The issue is it's inconsistent each time i extract coffee. When i do grind size 19. The first extraction comes out slow then I'll do a second extraction and it was come out faster and third extraction will have another different result. My first thing to do is increase grind size to 20 which is max espresso range on the baratza. Then it comes out too fast. The real confusing part is I've had espresso extracted between 25 to 30 seconds and 38Grams out on both settings. Idk where to go from here. Cause on grind size 19 it'll usually take me from 35 to 45 seconds to extract the coffee and it's bitter or on grind size 20 it will take 25 to 35 seconds but 40 to 50 grams will come out. Alot of inconsistency from each extraction but those two settings I've had few come out just right where it's not too watery or too bitter. 

Noted: each pour it does come out even and touch light brown/tan. 

My process:

Run the double shot two times to heat up the filter


Grind roughly 18 Grams


Setting 19 or 20


Normcore portafilter


WDT the grounds


Spring loaded normcore tamper


Puck screen


Put it in and do double shot. 


I followed the guidelines on dialing it in. I got to the grind size and I got in the rough area but it's just not the same every time which is killing me. Cause this was not cheap venture (already paying off vs going to local shops) i just want to master it. 

And i understand that it doesn't need to be perfect 36G in 27 seconds but why does it vary so much from extraction to extraction if everything is the same?

And this may seem like an odd request, but I need ways to break the crappy breakup cycle im in with my ex, for someone with ND who can hyperfixiate on stress, struggles with changes to routine etc. 

I was with my ex 18 months, not too long for moving on to not be 100% doable, but we lived together a year, so a lot of my routines/associations are now built around him. I'll be forever grateful for being introduced to sourdough bread and filtered coffee, but the rest id like to detach from now, my head and heart are ready. Need to get ADHD brain onboard.

We've been in a cycle of keeping in contact (he's helping me with some other medical issues but I'm in process of arranging other care stuff) but this keeps resulting in us getting closer, him then withdrawing, us arguing, repeat. So I've decided that I'm going to stop contacting him for a while, to let my brain detach  (I still have things at his and he's going to help me make my kitchen more accessible, but I'm putting that off for now as I've been in so much pain recently with my other health stuff) because there is still the dopamine hit of contact with him, and a strong association to my old routine. I haven't really full established one here yet, so my brain wants that one back. 

Fortunately, one of the perks of ADHD I've found is out of sight, out of mind, its the reason I've got multiple unread texts on Whatsapp (some opened and then remarked as unread that I still never end up opening) and 1348 unread emails. Here are some things I've done so far: 

1) deleted social media apps from my phone temporarily, not because he posts on social media all that frequently, but because it gives me that more frequent attachment to my phone which ends in doom scrolling the break-up sub reddit, or texting him. 
2) trying to develop a routine on my own, that is the same, everyday. Same sort of wake up time, bed time, same time for meds, coffee, breakfast, lunch, etc. Same time to do physio/rehab stuff. Similar working hours (I'm on low hours due to medical issues, but work for myself so that's hard at times!)
3) setting a goal for the day to achieve

The things that id like to try to find help with his:

1) breaking the mental association to texting him - Ive considered deleting his number temporarily, and writing it down on a notebook, however, due to my medical issues and him being the only person a close enough distant to meet me at the hospital or take me there, I also lose my emergency contact, which is on my phone, Incase of emergencies, I've had an ambulance called here recently, so not worth the risk with that one, so I thought maybe deleting all our texts?
2) going over aspects of the breakup in my mind, to the point I hyperfixiate on it (haven't found a way to do this yet?) even though I don't want to reconcile at this point or see him the same way anymore. 
3) reliance on nicotine and weed to numb my feelings lol (I do get the weed medicannally for pain as the opiates suck but want to cut down a little, so I'm going to stay with a friend in a week or so to have less opportunity to do that and going to try to quit vaping next week, as it was a vice I picked back up in the breakup.) 

Are there any apps you've used? Like adhd friendly mental health apps for well-being, building routine, setting personal goals. I need to find a way of getting my dopamine elsewhere.

The observation being made is that the characters talk a big game about Italian pride and the suffering of their people over the years, but that when push comes to shove, most of them are barely Italian at all. Just dumb burger-eaters from New Jersey.

I'd like to argue that this isn't a valid analysis of the characters. The Italian-American people are a coherent ethnic group with a distinct shared culture, cuisine, and dialect. Granted, this group- born of the Italian diaspora- was eroding in the early 2000s (and still is today), but it is undeniable that it exists. Without it, there wouldn't be a mob.

For example, a top YT comment on the [scene](https://youtu.be/Lqb-AcciVQw) where Tony meets Furio in Italy is ""Italy is the country where every italian-american realizes He is no more italian than a big mac."" This is unfair. Over centuries, Italian-American culture evolved and became its own distinct thing, retaining some things from Italy and adapting some things from the new world. 

It's very easy to trash Americans for being totally lacking in culture, but I'd argue (as neither an Italian nor an American) that Italian-American culture is very generously portrayed in *The Sopranos*. Sunday dinners, mass consumption of coffee and wine, use of Italian phrases in English conversation, manly men being physically affectionate with each other and not seeming emasculate, etc. 

Maybe the portrayal of Italian-Americans in the show is an over-the-top caricature, but I don't think the intent of the scenes in which Italian and Italian-American cultures clash is to make us believe Paulie is a mungecake.

It's slow like honey

Your memory will fix itself something liberal

All that sugar isn't natural but it tastes like I always remembered it 

Oatmeal and berries with a swirl of peanut butter that tastes like dessert for breakfast

Once when I was a child I ate a worm baked in summer sun

It tasted like shit

But I don't remember the taste of it

I remember the movements 

The sun hitting my skin, my hands warm preparing themselves to peal thin

My fingers like parchment paper and my throat like a desert 

I remember the work of bringing a gulp down and my eyes gingerly closing

But the taste isn't part of it

And that's the only thing that I remember when I think about it

I did it to impress you, an act of courage or maybe servitude

I talked to you once in class and you didn't remember until I mentioned it

A thousand years later when we first kissed

You moved your hair like we were underwater

You guided my fingertips to your shoulders under streetlights 

The skin on your cheek reflected the night like freckles made of stardust

And it tasted like coffee and it still does 

It's slow like honey

I asked if you remembered it one day

Of course you did, but I wonder if in your memory of it, the snow falls and melts on our faces

The sun sets west out the window between the leaves and I watch it above the book I'm reading as a child I don't know what I hated so much about this

It might’ve been the assignment, maybe the choice I didn't have in it, I would get distracted so easily, I remember counting the letters and listening to the music instead

I think it was watching you read that made me try it again a thousand years later

It was Lord of the Flies on a plane. I finished it the day I came home.

A few years before my uncle left and decided he wouldn't come back

I remember it from a few conversations but never saw it

The part where he left and appeared as a ghost in family portraits

A head full of nest and I'm told that he didn't stand a chance

I always remembered a man who would prove that he was one with a flared chest and deep breath

He got into bar fights, yelled at the television, and played war in his mind

He’d give gift cards at Christmas then pour himself drinks as his face slowly flushes 

He’d cry to himself when he was alone 

He took me to a park once

He forgot me there and I swung into the clouds like an airplane over and over

He fought my dog

In the middle of the day as the sun bathed the countertops and shadowed the chaos 

I stood like a shadow before the gate and watched the blood pool from his wrist and forearm onto the tile and in the cracks forever

I remember him picking me up from school until he didn't in the winter because of the ice

I remember he cared so much for us that he’d kill anyone who stood to take it

He has a daughter now but we dont see her

He adored her like every decision he made was hers

She has his eyes, blue and white like a stretched ocean under a summer sky

He loved us and I think he still does

It's slow like honey

Every waking memory trickles down and only parts make it to the mouth

I feel too old now to be worrying about how I remember a memory

The glint blinds me so I look into the shade hoping to find a reprieve in the bushes

The book closed and I admired the white and yellow ring at my knees

My aunt killed herself with a shotgun in the spring 

She would post sunsets with no caption

Her artwork was pretty and colorful with space cadets and long-haired women covered by branches and solar winds

Nobody cared to see it but they claimed their reasons

This was a different woman than the one I knew

Her hair spray would stick to my neck when she’d hug me

That day she left I smelled the perfume she wore creeping in from an open window

I stood tall and weak for a moment in the kitchen watching as birds fluttered from the feeder

I hadn't seen her in some time, but I heard a lot of stories about her

She could not help herself and what I remember was only a shell

She worked in the hospital

She had demons with voices that followed her

She accused the doctors

I don't know what she believed in but whatever it was I hope she's comfortable 

I don't pray but I think about her all the same

She was always sweet to me, she talked to me like a person and not a child

We didn't hold a funeral for her, I would’ve made it if we did

For me, I dont want one either

Give me to science or throw me to the vultures

I hope she had the same sentiment 

She adored my brother

I tilt my drink back and forth so that the ice cubes clink like a boxing ring

An impressionist painting of curiosity

He didn't speak but did so eloquently. He was saying things we just didn't hear them.

His hair cowlicked like mine

My hair is long now and its waves and curls become light in the summers

I remember those women who would come by for speech and therapy

They talked to you carefully as I watched on the carpet 

You flew through the cognitive sessions like practice

I remember the expressions on all of their faces

We read books and slept in the same bed, watched movies and I knew you understood everything

We walked the yard and played ball. I never underestimated you. 

You were four when they found you unresponsive in bed 

I looked but I didn't want to

That night you found me in a dream and we watched that morning unfold from the periphery, holding hands and listening to the clouds

I felt everything from the breeze to the sun, my mother's arms around the boy on the couch watching cartoons, but I wasn't sad, you told me that everything was in its right place

I was told you were in purgatory, but I knew better than to believe what they said 

If there was a God he would’ve had you at his hip 

We carried that stone of yours with Cars and John Deer all the way north

I still watch it close when I’m home 

I sip my drink looking over the water that reflects the deflecting red in the sun's disappearance

Slow like honey

I swallow and brace for the impact of everything

I don't know of all these remembrances what I'll all remember in the morning

I look behind me and see you resting your eyes on the sofa under arching orange skies

The first time I saw you sleeping I cried 

Because I’d never seen such a beautiful thing 

You slipped off into your dreams like a thief of masculinity, quick and unapologetic

Under the TV light and arm on my right, you swallowed up my pride for me

I remember such things as dessert because the longer they bake they burn 

It’s slow like honey

And if I remember enough they’ll taste like my pancakes with berries and peanut butter in a swirl

I watch as your eyes flicker under the comfort of nature on a television

I remember a fortune.

I remember everything.

It's slow like honey

Your memory will fix itself something liberal

All that sugar isn't natural but it tastes like I always remembered it 

Oatmeal and berries with a swirl of peanut butter that tastes like dessert for breakfast

Once when I was a child I ate a worm baked in summer sun

It tasted like shit

But I don't remember the taste of it

I remember the movements 

The sun hitting my skin, my hands warm preparing themselves to peal thin

My fingers like parchment paper and my throat like a desert 

I remember the work of bringing a gulp down and my eyes gingerly closing

But the taste isn't part of it

And that's the only thing that I remember when I think about it

I did it to impress you, an act of courage or maybe servitude

I talked to you once in class and you didn't remember until I mentioned it

A thousand years later when we first kissed

You moved your hair like we were underwater

You guided my fingertips to your shoulders under streetlights 

The skin on your cheek reflected the night like freckles made of stardust

And it tasted like coffee and it still does 

It's slow like honey

I asked if you remembered it one day

Of course you did, but I wonder if in your memory of it, the snow falls and melts on our faces

The sun sets west out the window between the leaves and I watch it above the book I'm reading as a child I don't know what I hated so much about this

It might’ve been the assignment, maybe the choice I didn't have in it, I would get distracted so easily, I remember counting the letters and listening to the music instead

I think it was watching you read that made me try it again a thousand years later

It was Lord of the Flies on a plane. I finished it the day I came home.

A few years before my uncle left and decided he wouldn't come back

I remember it from a few conversations but never saw it

The part where he left and appeared as a ghost in family portraits

A head full of nest and I'm told that he didn't stand a chance

I always remembered a man who would prove that he was one with a flared chest and deep breath

He got into bar fights, yelled at the television, and played war in his mind

He’d give gift cards at Christmas then pour himself drinks as his face slowly flushes 

He’d cry to himself when he was alone 

He took me to a park once

He forgot me there and I swung into the clouds like an airplane over and over

He fought my dog

In the middle of the day as the sun bathed the countertops and shadowed the chaos 

I stood like a shadow before the gate and watched the blood pool from his wrist and forearm onto the tile and in the cracks forever

I remember him picking me up from school until he didn't in the winter because of the ice

I remember he cared so much for us that he’d kill anyone who stood to take it

He has a daughter now but we dont see her

He adored her like every decision he made was hers

She has his eyes, blue and white like a stretched ocean under a summer sky

He loved us and I think he still does

It's slow like honey

Every waking memory trickles down and only parts make it to the mouth

I feel too old now to be worrying about how I remember a memory

The glint blinds me so I look into the shade hoping to find a reprieve in the bushes

The book closed and I admired the white and yellow ring at my knees

My aunt killed herself with a shotgun in the spring 

She would post sunsets with no caption

Her artwork was pretty and colorful with space cadets and long-haired women covered by branches and solar winds

1i2abpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD_Survivors/comments/1i2abpf/advice_on_friendship/,Advice on friendship ,"Hi, I’m looking for advice on handling a difficult situation with a close friend. We live in a small town, so running into each other is inevitable, but I feel like this friendship has become unhealthy for both of us. 
 
Over the past few months, I’ve noticed that our dynamic has become filled with conflicts, misunderstandings, and hurtful comments from both sides. While I do care about them, I feel like continuing this friendship isn’t good for my mental health. I need this cycle to end and to end good. 

The issue is that I’m afraid to end it outright because I don’t want things to get awkward or escalate into something bigger, especially in a small-city environment. She knows a lot about me and my family. 

I'm seeing her next week after she ghosted for a month. She came back and I fell down, i accepted meeting the hang-out request. 

I was planning on having a conversation straight forward but a closed one told me it's not a good idea.  
Some of you already told me to make a slow fade but I don't know how to do it, I could put excuses but she will see me hang out with other people, maybe posting online, or even going to the grocery store, so it's not that easy. 

She wants to meet at her house and I don't feel comfortable, this also angers me because I don't feel considerated. 

So this is it, how do I end this? How do i get out of the cycle? How do I tell her that I prefer meeting her in a coffee shop or something like that?",1,1736981820.0,BPD_Survivors,1,1.0,False
1i2abdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1i2abdc/use_shortcuts_and_automations_to_actually/,Use Shortcuts and Automations to actually remember to utilize your systems,"By popular demand! Here is a bunch of stuff about shortcuts. I was talking into my phone and if I start editing it I will literally spend hours on this so for now here we are. 

Here are some things I use/plan to use shortcuts for to give you an idea:

\- A shortcut that adds a reoccurring reminder like buy more coffee to your reminders list

\- A laundry timer that first gives you the option of choosing wash or dry, and then set a reminder for the proper length of time

\- An NFC tag that I can tap that will automatically start a transcription recording so that I can quickly record meetings

\- A collection of shortcuts that lets me add notes to a specific notes that I have reserved for my planner

\- A quick shortcut to just add something to a brain dump page

\- An automation to track the number of in office days I have each month that’s triggered every time I go into the office

\- This one’s related, but I haven’t figured out how to automate it yet. You can create a list of reminders in the reminders app and then make it into a template and then anytime you want to use that specific list. You just create a new one and use your template so for example, 

\- An automation that will open your shopping list every time you get to the grocery store

\- And automation that triggers a shortcut every night at sunset to ask you if you’d like to anything to write anything about the day

\- I try to do weekly reports which is one thing I am reading eating playing obsessing over recommending and trying that weekP more complex shortcut that will let me add to my report and then I will select a letter and it will add it to a note with the prefix of that letter

\- If you do, Apple watches competitions, you know that you need to open up the Apple Watch competition app every single day in order for it to track anything so I have an automation that opens up my app every day at sunset to make sure it’s there

By far the most helpful one I’ve made so far is a collection of shortcuts that lets me add ideas to one single note where I store things until I can put them into my planner. Basically, I created several similar shortcuts where I can press a button to add a specific type of thing to this list and into the list it will add a description and then when I type, for example I like to be able to quickly jot down ideas for gifts, and if I press the gift reminder shortcut widget it will prompt me to write in gift idea and for the person and then it will add it to my brain dump note and it will look like gift idea: and then it will have the gift idea so that helps me, avoiding adding random nonsense into a list and never knowing what to make of it.

**this is the actual walk through part**

  
OK, so I’m going to walk through how to set up a basic automation and shortcut. It should give you an idea of how these work and honestly once you get the structure, it isn’t too difficult to learn by doing. 

So ultimately, we’re going to create a way to either press a button on your phone or say hey Siri do blank, or hit the button. 



1. Create a note in your Notes app and call it something like brain dump

2. Go into your shortcuts, create a new shortcut and and start by adding “ask for input”

1. Set input to text, and change the prompt to whatever you’re going to write down, here it would be something like “ add to brain dump page

3. Then you want to add “append to note”

1. In the first blank, you’re going to define what you’ll be adding to the note and in this case, we want to ask us every time (which is what we setup in the first step). You should see some suggestions and you can just select ask for input and it will link this step to the previous step and you’ll see a line between the two to confirm it

2. In the second blank, you’re going to find the note that you created for this so you just type in the name and you should be able to select it every now and then there’s issues with finding it. You might just have to restart your Notes app if it’s a brand new note

4. Last is optional, but I really like it as a confirmation you can add a vibration to the end of this automation so that way you will know that it has been successfully added when it vibrates

5. Also optional, you can have the note open after you’ve added something I don’t always do that cause I like to just be able to add something and move on

6. If you want to be able to trigger it with Siri, make sure to name it something easy to say like *add to brain dump* so that way all you have to do is say ""hey Siri add to brain dump"" and it will start your trigger. ",1,1736981794.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

F 25 located in CST (4:00 PM) looking to find a couple more partners to fill missing desires! (Read if you’re seeing this you’re not being replaced!) obligatory disclaimers: I write in first person, I don’t like people who control my character, I like story movement and don’t want to be the only one pushing. 

**if you’ve messaged before and I haven’t gotten back to you, it’s entirely possible your message got lost. Try again and make it interesting! 

Please be 23+, within 6 hours of CST, capable of 4+ decently written paragraphs, friendly, and have a common interest in at minimum romance + 1 other interest. Romance is a **must** for these roles

Ideas:
The other dragons laughed when you shared your thesis that humans should be capable of learning magic. Infuriated, you fly off to capture a human and teach it the ways of magic.

Somehow, some way, a human managed to acquire both a pomegranate from the underworld and fruit from the realm of the Fae, then made a smoothie out of them. Now, Hades and the Fae are in a fierce argument regarding who the human belongs to. (Will you be the fae or hades?) 

In a world with gods old and new, everyone is born with the symbol of their god on their forehead. The symbol on my forehead is one that hasn’t been seen in centuries, when I became an adult the god came down to earth to help build their temple. 

I’m most interested in finding someone that I can chat with ‘out of character’ just as easily as I can send a roleplay reply to. I like to be friendly, chat about nonsense and just have fun with each other.  I’m frequently described as quirky, sensitive, kind, thoughtful, playful, and a bit of a hippie.

He sat in the corner of the cafe as she entered the building, it was as if she demanded the attention of everyone just by existing.  He kept a nonchalant eye on her, not wanting to be accused of being a creep or staring, but he couldn't help but continue to look.  Her long blonde curls bounced softly as she walked towards the counter, her hips visibly swaying even beneath her heavy winter coat.  The clatter of dishes being thrown into the sink, the bathroom door swinging open and shut, and the quiet hum of the heater running snapped him back to reality from his day dreams.  Again, for just a brief moment, images of ropes, candle light, steam, and sheets filled his mind.  *Clang* The beautiful woman sat down in front of him and began to speak. 

""My name is Paige. I'm new here."" She smiled at him shyly before taking another sip of coffee. ""I guess you could say that I'm looking for someone to show me around town?"" The words came out easily, like they had been rehearsed or something, charming and seductive, yet seemingly totally innocent.

Can’t take sectional or giant sofas, 4th bed, big dressers, garage fridge, etc. Debating taking one loveseat and one sofa. They’ll take the bookcases, too, as I don’t think they’ll fit in the Unit. Antiques: dining room table/6 chairs, huge kitchen table (drop leaf, gateleg), 6 chairs, giant ancient mirror, rice bed, 2-3 small dressers, loveseat and chairs, very fragile shelf unit, very large portraits of grandparents (ack) (no place to put them in tiny house), china cabinet, small bar cabinet, very large buffet, tall corner curio cabinet, blah blah.

All the components on my bike are 10 speed (which I don’t want to upgrade because I’m building a 90s coffee run bike), I have a nice pair of spare wheels but these have an 11 speed cassette on them.. is it possible to ONLY swap the cassette from an 11 to 10 or do I need to change other parts (free hub etc).

","























































































































Hi! I’m in Columbus Ohio and I’m looking for cool women to be friends with! I’ve realized I’m ace for a few years now.

About me: I’m 32, live in Columbus, Ohio, and I’m into all things horror and spooky. I like watching things about Bigfoot and aliens and ghost and unexplained mysteries. I also enjoy playing traditional card games and board games. I like football and I’m 420 friendly. I also am interested in religion and spirituality and I like watching and listening to things about those topics too. 

I’m looking for a friend to get coffee with, hang out with, have movie nights or game nights with, and maybe have some late night smoke sesh philosophical conversations with. 

If you want to message me, please be in central Ohio! ",1,1736981574.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1i2a6nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/caloriecount/comments/1i2a6nr/use_this_sub_properly/,Use this sub properly,"I know not everyone is as intuitive as I might be, but boy does scrolling through this sub get depressing sometimes. Apart for the 50-75% of this sub’s user base being people with some kind of ED asking how many calories are in a fucking coffee or a bowl of rice, the rest of us seem to not understand what this sub is intended for. 

When you go to a restaurant and order a meal and don’t know the calories for that meal, use this sub. If you go to a family dinner and don’t want to look like a freak weighing everything before you put it on your plate, use this sub. Basically any situation where there is food in front of you that you didn’t prepare yourself but want to know the calories, you can and should use this sub! 

However, if you make a meal by yourself containing 100g of penne rigate, 1 cup of classico four cheese pasta sauce, and 1 large russet potato, just use your fucking brain. There are labels containing nutritional information on almost everything you can find in a grocery store. So just do the math yourself. Obviously if you’re posting on this sub you have a wifi connection and a phone/computer with a calculator on it, so you don’t even have to use your brain. I have a google home in my kitchen so you know what I do? Prepare the ingredient, weight it on my scale, then say “hey google how many calories are in ____ grams of ____?” Sometimes the numbers are too specific for google so I may have to turn my brain on for 30 seconds to do some basic algebra, but that’s it. 

If you know what ingredients and how much of them, you should not be using this sub. It would probably take more time to wait for an accurate response from someone in this sub than it would to cook and eat the entire meal, so just do it yourself as you are preparing it. Honestly, using this sub is unnecessary like 95% of the time. The only situations I can think of where I genuinely couldn’t just figure out the calories on my own are the restaurant and family dinner ones I mentioned earlier. Like where do you think the people answering your questions are getting their information? They’re just figuring it out themselves using the photos you provide. Meanwhile you actually have the food for real in front of you so you will obviously get more accurate information by doing it yourself.

As for those of you with an ED; please please take care of yourself and eat a decent amount of food each day. ",33,1736981436.0,caloriecount,16,0.88,False
