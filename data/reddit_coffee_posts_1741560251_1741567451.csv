I also thought about just buying a roll of coffee filter like paper and draping 2 or 3 layers over the top of the drip pan as I pour it in but that will likely take more time as I'll have to make sure it doesn't overflow.

1j7lhxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1j7lhxc/want_to_talk_with_a_girl_who_broke_up_with_her/,Want to talk with a girl who broke up with her boyfriend recently,"My situation is the following. Some months ago I was in a dating app and came across a girl's profile. This girl was one of the most striking profiles I've ever seen. Funny, same goals in a relationships, much of our likes (history, art history, among others) were intertwined, etc. This, coupled with the fact that she was beautiful (not model level, but someone who you would probably say is pretty if you saw her on the street) made me super interested in her, not only on a physical level but much much more on an intellectual level.

I kinda ignore the profile and go about my business, and some months after I go out with a friend of mine and he asks me what I've been up to romantically. I told him not much and start raving about this girl that I saw on a dating app. Some solid raving (about 5 or maybe close to 10 min). My friend then asks me her name and I tell him (her profile was so striking that much of the details stood out in my mind months after)  and he makes fun that maybe it's a girl he works with. We start laughing about it but then he shows me her Instagram profile and it was the girl. I was absolutely shocked.

He asks me if he wants him to talk about me to the girl, to which I make myself kinda ""shy"" but at the same time saying ""please do"". He tells me that it would probably end badly because he though the girl was in a relationship already. Turns out, the girl broke up with her boyfriend earlier the week (early February) when my friend and I went to have a coffee. Nevertheless, he talks about me to her, and tells her this story to which she found amusing (given the information that my friend provided). 

She says that I can follow her on instagram and DM her and I do but she does not reply back. I give her time because I don't want to rush or pressure her. A week goes by and my friend asks her about if she messaged me already and she tells him that she's not in a good place mentally yet to go into another relationship. Another week goes by and I go to their workplace (they work at a museum and went more to have lunch with my friend and chat with him then to talk to her). 

Nevertheless, he warns her that I'm coming to the museum so that she doesnt find it weird and she tells him that I could talk to her with no problem. I go to the museum, have a lunch with my friend and go visit the museum and I come to the section that she was around. I chat with her for around 5 mins.

Not an amazing talk. I ask her what paintings she would recommend me seeing, her favourite art movements, we talk about our hate about picasso, and make a joke about an ice-cream that I was planning to give her (she was aware of this. She texted me previously to warn me that she appreciated the gesture and the care but that there was no need) and go about my business. 

I really want to talk with her but now my friend and her probably won't see each other again because their contracts are up. He told me to text her around Monday or Tuesday and chat her up about some our similar likes, for example Bob Dylan etc etc.

This is all find and dandy but she has insisted twice that she is not ready for anything right now. I told my friend that I can wait just because I'm so interested in her, but at the same time I don't want to pressure her into talking to ne when she already said that she does not want anything. At the same time, I think we are kinda the same from what my friend gathered (hopeless romantics) and she got really bad because her boyfriend wanted something casual when she want something long-term (the relationship was not long) from what my friend gathered.

My stepdad has had anger issues my entire life, and as a child, he was both emotionally and physically abusive toward me. Now, as an adult (and pregnant), I see his passive-aggressive control tactics for what they are, but my mom continues to gaslight me and justify his behavior.

The most frustrating part? He goes out of his way to be petty and controlling, and she acts like it’s normal. Some examples:
	•	He changed where he puts the trash cans just so they’d be in my parking spot when I got home.
	•	He hoards food and drinks, even though we contribute financially, and even taped shut a pack of green tea after I took some out to put in the fridge.
	•	He only puts out enough coffee pods for him and my mom, even though we all paid for them. When I left a used K-Cup in the machine (which everyone does), he put it back in the box with the unused ones instead of just throwing it away—then did the exact same thing himself the next day.
	•	He throws tantrums over things that make no sense, like toilet paper, and just creates an uncomfortable, hostile environment for no reason.

None of these things are huge on their own, but the pattern is obvious—he wants me to feel like an outsider in this house, like I don’t belong, and like I’m always doing something wrong. My mom completely defends him and tells me I’m making a big deal out of nothing, even though she knows how he is.

It’s gotten to the point where I told my mom I don’t feel safe around him. Instead of listening to me, she went behind my back and asked my boyfriend if he really thinks my stepdad would hurt me. My boyfriend told me later, “Based on everything I’ve seen and heard, I would say so,” but he didn’t even respond to her because he saw exactly what she was doing—trying to manipulate the situation and get him to invalidate my feelings.

To make it even more frustrating, my mom recently had a burst blood vessel in her eye from coughing and sent a picture to my sister (who is my stepdad’s biological child). My sister’s first response was, ‘Did Daddy hit you?’ That alone should tell you everything about his reputation.

At this point, I know I just need to keep my head down, keep saving money, and get out ASAP. But in the meantime, how do you deal with the constant, exhausting passive-aggression of an abuser when you’re still stuck in their space? I try to ignore it, but it wears me down, and I’m getting so emotionally drained. Any advice or support would mean a lot.",1,1741564717.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

I’ve struggled with mental health my whole life. 3 years ago I went through an extremely traumatic experience so that’s why I’m talking about my PTSD in the messages (the event took place 3 years ago this month so that’s why I mention especially around this time of year I struggle). 


I’m just confused: 

I understand how draining it must be to be in my life. I have multiple mental illnesses that affect my personality as well as how I function and it’s always changes day to day some days I’m doing fine some days I’m doing great and some days my brain is literally tortures me. I never know what to expect and neither do those around me. I understand how hard it must be to be in a relationship with me. And I am grateful my boyfriend stuck it through these past couple of years. 

I admit I am probably the worst person to make plans with 
1) because of my extremely strict parents it’s such a process 
2) because if I’m not in the right headspace on a day there’s a chance I’m gonna cancel because why would I go in public in the middle of a panic attack or PTSD episode. The public or doing things only adds more stress to my plate. With my boyfriend I usually try to still see him but change the plan’s slightly (plans to go to Top Golf… could we do a movie at home instead?) etc. 

But honestly I’m just confused. 

We’ve been fighting a lot. 

A lot of it has to do with things that are my fault. 
A lot of things are things that have happened because of either my parents or my mental health. 

And I know the parents situation needs to be fixed I’m on top of that fixing that. 

But in all honesty when it comes to my mental health I feel like he could be doing a better job supporting me. And I wish I could communicate that to him. 

1) I just want to be listened to when I talk about my mental health I don’t want advice unless you’re my psychiatrist (he’s obviously not) and most of the time people will just say “push through your anxiety like I did and now I’m so happy”… I don’t have anxiety I mean I do, but it’s a sub symptom of my BPD, PTSD, and again depression. 
2) I wish he could just show support in small but meaningful ways: sit on the phone with me we don’t have to talk, hug me, sit next to me and just let me cry on his shoulder, offer to take me out to get ice cream or a coffee or bring over a favorite snack of mine. BUY ME FLOWERS (I really wish he did this more) 
3) not get so angry with me when my mind is all over the place. 

How can I communicate this to him? 
Am I overreacting? 
Am I an awful gf? 
Is this fixable? 
Is this means to break up? ",2,1741564675.0,AmIOverreacting,50,0.75,False

The dimensions of the nook for the fridge are 36 inches (wide) x 72 inches (tall) and it's a standard depth nook (it's 30 inches deep, I don't really care if the fridge pokes out a bit). I don't have a ton of requirements for it other than it should roughly fit that area and it should have an ice maker that drops into a tray so that enough ice can be easily taken out of the fridge to be used when making iced coffee. Some of the fridges I've looked at look like they only have an ice maker that dispenses from the dispensers on the outside of the fridge, which wouldn't really work - most don't have enough room for a carafe to fit so dispensing ice directly into the carafe wouldn't be possible, also feel like just doing it that way would take too long and be too annoying, so I'd rather just have an ice tray that I can remove from the freezer and then scoop into the carafe.

I am open to suggestions and recommendations though (otherwise I wouldn't be posting!). As long the size of the fridge is right. One thing I have found annoying is it's hard to tell if a fridge has an ice maker that drops into a tray or not? Like most that have ice makers *I think* only have a dispenser. The freezer will still have a tray location, but it doesn't actually drop ice into it automatically (or at least... this is what it seems like, maybe I'm wrong but it just doesn't seem clear, especially when you are looking online).

Through the night my husband is in the spare room and I have her in my room, so I do all the night feeds (I ebf), diaper changes, etc. I haven’t slept longer than 3 and a half hours since she was born, meanwhile he hasn’t had to get up once. Through the day, he works 8-6, but usually stays late so doesn’t get home till seven. A lot of the time he’ll pass out on the couch, or if he stays awake he doesn’t want to hold the baby for long, so I get very little hands free time.  It’s always a struggle to get her to nap for longer than thirty minutes at a time so I can’t really do anything even when she’s down, she’s a very sensitive sleeper too and her bedroom is right next to the living room/sitting room so I basically just have to sit there until she’s awake because the slightest sound will disturb her. 

She’s an extremely alert baby, has been ever since birth basically, so when she’s awake it’s just constantly trying to entertain her. She likes to be walked around non stop and as soon as I sit down she starts screaming. It’s exhausting honestly. She hates the bouncer, the swing and the baby carrier too so I have to hold her exclusively. My husband has said it’s not really an excuse to not do anything as I could just put her down anyway and let her “cry it out”. I don’t believe in that, and when she’s crying it’s all I can focus on, so I do not think it’s an excuse. 

If he takes her in the evening it’s usually only so I can eat dinner or shower, then he wants to hand her right back after. As I mentioned previously, she needs to be walked around or else she’ll cry, but he refuses because he says he’s too tired so he will just hold her while she screams and I have to rush whatever I’m doing so I can take her back and calm her. I only get one day usually where it’s not 100% my responsibility, which is Saturday when we go grocery shopping, run errands, maybe go out to eat or get coffee, even then it can be stressful as she’s getting less and less tolerant of being out and about. Sundays, like today, he’s gone all day until late evening, doing his hobbies or at his mom’s house helping her. She doesn’t care if I need him at home helping me, she just demands he comes over and he will. 

All my family are in another country so aside from him I’m completely on my own, there’s no one to come help. Writing this all out, I realise how unfair the balance is, but everyone around me says it is fair. Since he works long hours on his feet all day at his manual labour job, I’m told it’s perfectly acceptable that I do all the child care, especially since I’m going to be a SAHM for the first few years, something I’m privileged to be able to do as he earns enough on his own. For now he’s agreed to do the housework I can’t do, like dishes, the cat litter box, cooking etc, but even my own mother gives me crap for not doing that right now, told me I should have dinner ready for him when he comes home. Okay, but like how? I can barely even eat myself, let alone cook a full meal for him. 

I’m tired out today and she’s being extra fussy, but I can’t even get hold of him on the phone to ask when he’ll be home. It’s just really tough right now.",8,1741564516.0,beyondthebump,45,0.83,False

1j7lciw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceNcoolThings/comments/1j7lciw/guidebest_toothpastes_according_to_my_exhaustive/,"[GUIDE]Best toothpastes according to my exhaustive research for years, best remineralizers for dentin and enamel.","If you have anything you'd like to add,etc, feel free to comment below. I've downloaded over 109 science papers in regards to oral health,tooth repair,cavity prevention and oral health and combed through all of them, the papers’ subjects vary from peptides to zinc hydroxyapatite,non-micro hydroxyapatite, micro hydroxyapatite and nano-hydroxyapatite and also other nano particles and nano science,also chitosan and theobromine,etc. I also used chatgpt A.I., deepseek A.I. and also Google gemini advanced A.I. to review my notes and my conclusions.I will also provide my current recipe for homemade toothpaste and other advice.

(I have no medical degrees)

1.) First and foremost nutrition: amino acids, proteins, vitamin and mineral nutrition science are one of the first things that should be checked & studied when one has oral health problems. Also, genetics, diet and any current or past medications.

2.) I’ve come to the conclusion based on many science papers that nano Hydroxyapatite is too dangerous to use in a toothpaste and should only be used to treat teeth, cavities and dentin in a very isolated & careful way. Nano particles are so small they can pass through and permeate throughout the entire body and it’s especially a bad idea to brush this into gums,etc. that are so close to the blood brain barrier. An analogy is how diatomaceous earth screws up an insect’s body because it’s so small.

Here is one study among many that I discovered and reviewed: (Adverse Biological Effect of TiO2 and Hydroxyapatite Nanoparticles Used in Bone Repair and Replacement,2016)

As far as hydroxyapatite(HA) goes, based on my research non-nano zinc hydroxyapatite is the best type of HA to use in a toothpaste, it works great repairing dentin AND enamel. Nano size works even better but it should not be used in a toothpaste as i’ve said.

Here are the three forms of zinc hydroxyapatite that I’m aware of, I cant find a way to buy any of them online, i can only find them in 5 different toothpaste products.

\~1.) Zinc-Substituted Hydroxyapatite (Zn-HAp) Ca₁₀₋ₓZnₓ(PO₄)₆(OH)₂

\~2.) Zinc Carbonate-Hydroxyapatite (Zn-CHA)  Ca₁₀₋ₓZnₓ(PO₄)₆₋ᵧ(CO₃)ᵧ(OH)₂​

\~3.) Biomimetic Zinc-Carbonate Hydroxyapatite

To be clear theobromine ranks best interestingly to repair enamel and use as a toothpaste, with Nano-Hydroxyapatite ranked 2nd in repairing enamel.

For dentin, Amelogenin-Derived Peptides (ADP5 or LRAP 8,9) across the board ranks #1 as the best to repair dentin. And Nano-Hydroxyapatite ranked 2nd. Unfortunately, i cannot find any toothpastes that have Amelogenin-Derived Peptides (ADP5 or LRAP 8,9), and I cant find anyway to obtain Amelogenin-Derived Peptides (ADP5 or LRAP 8,9).

3.) Theobromine, is fascinatingly one of the best to use to repair enamel, it ranks 1st across the board for enamel and ranks much lower in effectiveness in repairing dentin. Theobromine has shown to be more effective than any fluoride. (See: Surface Roughness of Restorative Materials After Simulated Toothbrushing with Toothpastes Containing Theobromine and Arginine: An In Vitro Study,2023)

Theobromine is found in cocoa powder, tea leaves and the cola plant,etc.  I am, however, wary of theobromine that is obtained from cocoa beans because of possible contamination from lead and cadmium that 90% of all chocolate has insanely harmful levels of.  Also caffeine in cocao powder and coffee,etc, causes tooth erosion. (See: The Contrasting Effects between Caffeine and Theobromine on Crystallization: How the Non-fluoride Dentifrice Was Developed,2021)

4.) Things to stay away from and that are scientifically harmful: glycerin in toothpaste(creates a barrier on teeth that blocks remineralizers), baking soda(too abrasive); charcoal(too abrasive,erodes teeth); fluoride(too much of it in our food and water already,etc), saccharin, erythritol and also preservatives in toothpaste, also Phthalimidoperoxycaproic Acid and Potassium Chloride.

4.5.) Use abrasives sparingly. Calcium carbonate is best to use, and it also helps with ph levels as well.

5.) In summary, What toothpastes would I recommend using? I will not recommend brands, but I absolutely recommend ones that are theobromine based and zinc hydroxyapatite based.

6.) I dont know of anywhere where I can host for free my 109+ science papers/pdfs and my research notes for all of you to read, study and download yourself. And even if I did and put a link here\_\_\_\_, reddit would likely flag my post and not approve it, reddit is very picky. if anyone has a place I can host the papers, let me know. I also dont have the money to pay a filehosting site.

7.) How to make one's own toothpaste, the best recipe:

Remineralizing Toothpaste:

\-2 tsp micro-hydroxyapatite powder (remineralization) 

\-2 tsp xylitol (anti-cavity)

\-1 tsp calcium carbonate (gentle polish)

\-1 tsp bentonite clay (detox/alkalinity)

\-1–2 drops peppermint oil or cinnamon oil or powder(lead free) or other flavor

\-1–2 tsp distilled water (adjust consistency as needed)

(bentonite clay is optional)  Also xylitol has excellent remineralizing properties.

NOTE: one can also use theobromine powder in one’s toothpaste(but I dont know how much) also If you are looking to use theobromine for enamel and dentin repair, aim for a particle size in the nanometer range (typically less than 100 nm) or micro range, I dont know the potential harms of nano theobromine, it needs to be researched.

Also, merely and simplistically using, for example, theobromine powder and adding it to toothpaste is not enough, one must also make sure the particle sizes are the best size for repairing dentin and separately repairing enamel.

The PH level of the toothpaste should be 7.0 to 8.5.

You can also consider adding to toothpaste Kaolin Clay (use 1 tsp) (Don’t use everyday: 2–3 times/week is sufficient for detox benefits.)

Be wary or kaolin & bentonite clay’s abrasiveness and leaching properties.

8.) What I have not finished researching, I have a list of over 60 chemicals, toothpaste ingredients and potential remineralizers. Such as aloe vera extract, Chitosan(which I know works very well as a remineralizer), also Coral calcium, Myrrha oil, zinc acetate, Pearl powder, and on and on. I have not had the time to study all this yet. I also am still studying the impact of vitamin/mineral deficiencies on oral health & cavities. And the harms of fluoride. It’s of course a work in progress.

9.) I am very poor & come from a very disadvantaged background, if you want you can donate/tip to me in appreciation for my work and my post:

Mom died 5 years ago, the trauma of it sent him insane and he has never been able to fully empathise or connect with my sister and I since. There’s been screaming fights, weeks and months of no or low contact, him managing to find ways to humiliate or let us down on special occasions. He has basically obliterated my mother’s memory, and spends all his time with his new partner and her family. We are out in the cold.

 But, he wanted a grandchild. He was so excited when I told him I was pregnant. Maybe the most proud and excited he’s been of me in years. When Nòra was in NICU, he was in the hospital. He got along with my mother’s relatives, after not speaking to them in years. And he really endeared himsef to my in-laws. He read a prayer at the funeral. For a few weeks after, he took me out for walks, for coffee.

 However, the sympathy well has apparently dried up. I first noticed the withdraw of support a few weeks ago, when I got engaged. My partner’s proposal was a beautiful surprise in a dark month. My sister suggested a brunch to celebrate. I mentioned in passing that dad could bring his partner if he wanted (why did I bother?). She was babysitting at that time, and I wasn’t about to change the event. So he was sour that she didn’t come. He let me pay for his meal, he didn’t even say thanks. Fine, whatever.

 I met him today for coffee. It’s so painfully obvious that he is not my support. I haven’t seen him in weeks because he moved house and is spending all of his time redecorating it. Except he does have time to care for my cousins children. Or attend his partners grandkids birthday party. Just no time to meet me for walk and chat. 

 I tried to tell him I’m proud of myself for getting fit and recovering after my surgery. He told me that he was a member of the same gym, but he was so busy moving house, he never got to go there. I told him I’m joining a choir - his response was “oh my partner is in a choir”. No encouragement. No praise. 

I’ve been in bits all day. I can’t believe I let myself fall for him again. He’s as distant as ever, but now he has managed to move himself to a house far away, where I am not invited. If my mother were here, she would be grieving her grandchild. Instead, this man treats me like an acquaintance and avoids any reference to my baby. I fucking hate him. He is a shallow, phoney, arrogant piece of shit. He was willing to be Mr. Grandad if Nòra lived. Now that she’s dead, he’s acting like nothing happened. ",3,1741564334.0,babyloss,3,1.0,False

I do black coffee and maybe a celery ginger juice as-well if I make some fresh. 


Recently keep seeing about high protein in the morning being the best way to curb cravings later in the day so I’ve been trialling that- but seriously I’ve never felt more hungry! It’s like it opens the gate to my stomach.
I’ve tried eggs, yogurt, oats etc (very clean and nutrient dense stuff) but just end up starving after wards. 


So past 2 mornings I thought maybe instead I’ll have a protein coffee to get the protein but not have to eat, as I hear a lot of people say adding protein to their coffee curbs all the hunger for majority of the day (came to around 220cals), and omg I feel 10x hungrier than if I just stuck to my black coffee. 


Anyone else the same? I do want tips as I do tend to binge or get cravings at night esp after dinner so I’m trying to counter that.

1j7l60k,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1j7l60k/my_walk_didnt_help_for_long/,My walk didn't help for long,"I noticed that my blood glucose was a little above the usual so decided to take a walk before dinner. (I knew that by the time I ate dinner it would be dark outside and a little colder.) When I got home I saw that my BG was below 100 mg/dl. Great so far. Then I picked up an Amazon package that was supposed to correct a deliver on Thursday. I had ordered 72 Keurig coffee pods and only got 12 on Thursday. My BG and my blood pressure both shot up when I discovered the idiots had done it again. Yup, another 12 cups. The shipping label even claims that the little box weighs 3.1 pounds. I put it on my scale and found that it weighed only 0.428 pounds. (My guess is that their system calculates the weight including the box that an order of 72 is supposed to be in.

End result is that Amazon refunded the $41 I paid because they can't get the order correct.

At this point I feel that the only way my blood pressure and blood glucose levels will drop again is if I get to take a 2 x 4 to the heads of the Amazon workers who packed my order. I can dream.",1,1741563820.0,diabetes_t2,1,0.67,False

1j7l2dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dishwashers/comments/1j7l2dq/long_rant_about_this_crappy_job_sorry/,Long rant about this crappy job (Sorry).,"I've been working as a dishwasher in The Netherlands for about two years now, but the last year has been tough. The dishwashing machine broke, and we’ve been forced to clean everything by hand. This causes the drain to clog up constantly and they kept blaming me for it (Guess what, the tank was just full). It's completely unsanitary, but the boss claims she can’t afford a new one as well as wanting to sell the place. 

I’m also in college, and at the beginning of January, I had my graduation period a stressful time with deadlines and making sure my thesis was perfect. Three months before, I requested two weeks off to focus, as I had accumulated enough free days. My boss didn’t give me a clear answer but insisted I work a few days. I refused. In december I saw I was still scheduled on the roster. I immediately responded in our group chat that I wasn’t going to come.

Their response? ""Your graduation is your problem."" They didn’t care. Even though I stood my ground, they pressured me into working some shifts, and we eventually agreed that I’d get the other days off. But when January 1st came, I was exhausted; I hadn’t even celebrated Christmas, so I called in sick. My boss’s reaction was extreme; coworkers told me she was literally crying because she “didn’t know what to do.” Turns out, it wasn’t even a problem. Hardly anyone eats out on January 1st, and there were already two other people working dishwashing and deliveries.

After that, they cut my shifts from three days a week to just one and made my life hell during my graduation period. I resent them for the stress they added when I needed to focus. Throughout January and February, I barely worked, and the treatment became even more unfair.

I never get scheduled for the fun shifts where staff get to drink and socialize—I only get the hardest, dirtiest jobs. I’m not even allowed to make coffee behind the bar anymore. Everyone else takes breaks freely, but the moment I step away, they’re on my case. Unlike other staff, I don’t get food to take home, and the chefs aren’t allowed to give me anything because they’d get in trouble.

The boss constantly pressures us to finish by a certain time, despite the fact that we’re doing everything by hand without a dishwasher. Sometimes, I’m just drying while another person washes. 

I get blamed for things I have nothing to do with. Just yesterday, my boss yelled at me for not making sure everyone got pizza, when I had only eaten one slice myself!

Today, I finally snapped. I was so fed up that I yelled in the kitchen, threatening to sue them and report them to the labor inspection. I told them I have video proof of how things are run and that I won’t stop until the restaurant is shut down. They pretty much ignored me and chef told me to do it because he agrees with me. 

I’m tired of being treated unfairly, but I also don’t want to quit because then I won’t get any financial compensation and I want them to feel justice. ",2,1741563526.0,dishwashers,3,1.0,False

I’m looking to hopefully make a connection that leads to some romance! Or some new wlw friends are cool too! 😂 Posting on Reddit again as I’ve met some lovely people on here, just hasn’t led to much! 😩

A lil about me, I am a bi cis lady, from Canada. I am pretty femme and girly, and I’d say I have a very cute, comfortable/casual style. I do want to get a few more tattoos in the future as well! I am about 5’4ish, average size ish, mixed, dark brunette with curly hair, and brown eyes. In terms of like actual hobbies I do spend most of my free time doing fibre crafts. I do love napping when I can, I do smoke sometimes, I love collecting blind box toys, vinyl and sneakers! I also enjoy doing my makeup and tweaking my skincare routine, and self care (does this count as a hobby lol?) I love going for walks with my music blasting, and hiking when I have the time, love me some cute coffee dates and I do game very seldom sometimes on my switch. I also love dogs, if you have one send pics PLZ. 🥰 I have an alright job, a few close friends and a boring life so overall my life is pretty quiet and drama free! ✨ Really just looking to share in the monotony of day to day life with someone, the highs and lows and whatever falls between those places too 😌

Im not really dead set on someone particular or a “type” I’m looking for, I’m very chatty and am hoping you are too though! I’d love to hear about your day everyday, your hobbies, yours passions and everything else going on! Also please have a good sense of humour!✨ I would prefer if you were close ish to my age or a bit older (24+), and preferably from Canada or North America? I can’t do huge time zone differences, I sleep too early! 😂 I am also monogamous relationship wise, very on the fence about kids (leaning no), and want to be around people who share the same values (politically left.) Also happy to swap selfies if you wanna see who you’re talking to! 

Please if you do reach out, please tell me your age, where you’re from and a little blurb about you so we can get to chitty chatting! Thanks for stopping in lmao ✨🫶🏼",3,1741563462.0,lesbianr4r,0,1.0,False
1j7l1gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j7l1gt/my_27f_best_friend_26f_of_8_years_just_dumped_me/,My (27F) Best Friend (26F) of 8+ Years Just Dumped Me Out of Nowhere—Am I Missing Something?,"I’m still in shock and could really use some outside perspectives. My best friend and I have been close since college—over 10 years of friendship. We were roommates, took art classes together, and supported each other through everything. She even posted a photo of us last year captioned *“love my bestie.”* We’ve been through breakups, job losses, and family struggles together. When my dad passed away in 2020, she was there for me, even giving me a beautiful heart-shaped locket with his picture.  

But recently, she’s completely cut me off, and I’m struggling to understand why.  

The Last Time We Met (first week of January 2025) 
We hung out at her apartment in early January. She’d just moved out of her parents’ place, and her TV wasn’t working, so my husband and I tried to help her fix it. I even brought her extra hand towels and kitchen utensils I had to spare. Everything seemed fine—we chatted, laughed, and caught up like always.  

After that, she texted me several weeks later to tell me about a job opening at her office. She even asked her boss about it, but they said it wasn’t a good fit. And that it would be a violation for her to recommend me. I thanked her for thinking of me and told her I appreciated it but I would keep searching.

And after this I finally landed a job I was proud of so I shared the new with her in a brief update (mid February 2025.

The Last Normal Conversation (Late February 2025) 
At the end of February, we had a short ish but normal conversation about the pets I’d recently adopted. She asked about their names, requested pictures, and we even talked about how awful it is that people treat black cats badly. The conversation petered off naturally, and I told her she was welcome to come over and cuddle the cats anytime.  

The Sudden Shift (March 2025)
In early March, I texted her to ask how she felt about running together once the weather warmed up. I wasn’t asking to hang out immediately—just floating an idea for the future (spring/summer). 

I said:Hey! Happy Friday! 🌟 How’s life treating you these days? I’ve been wanting to get back into running, and you came to mind, I remember how much you were into it for a while. Since the weather’s warming up soon, would you wanna team up for a weekend run sometime? We could jog and chat, kill two birds with one stone.  Like a weekly weekend running date?  
Totally get if you’re swamped (I still don’t know how you juggle everything 😅), but figured I’d float the idea. 

She responded with:Hey there! Im doing well thanks, I hope you are too and the new job is going well 💫. Yea I don't really do outdoor running lol, it's a lot more strain on the knees so I run indoor on a treadmill all year round. If you want to get into running I suggest joining a running group or club, there's a few around. Hope this helps!  

I replied with:Glad you are doing well!
Thanks for the tip! I'll probably just run outdoors on my own though. Just to clarify—I mostly suggested running together because I miss hanging out and thought it’d be fun to pair it with something you already do. I didn't realize you preferred the treadmill because of the knee strain, I totally get that! And I know you’re super busy, but if you ever want company at the gym or even a quick coffee break, I’m here! No pressure at all—just wanted to put it out there 💕

 Her next response was cold and dismissive:  

“We hung out like a month agooo lol 😭, that's really sweet of you and I appreciate it a lot. I enjoy your company as well but Im pretty booked, and it's going to be that way for a few years until and I get in and out of PA school. Is [other friend] around? maybe take some classes in the evening after work, explore different subjects and find what you want to do with a master's degree (if that's something you're still interested in pursuing). Take your husband running with you, draw, paint.” 

First of all, it hadn’t been “a month ago”—it had been two months since we last saw each other. Second, I wasn’t asking to hang out right away—just suggesting something for the future. Third, her unsolicited advice (*“take classes,” “find what you want to do”*) felt condescending, like she was implying I have nothing going on in my life.  

My Response 
I sent her a final message to clarify my intentions:  

“Hey—I’ve been thinking about your last message. To be honest, it left me confused. I didn’t reach out because I have ‘nothing going on’—I have pets now, a new job, and I’m starting to volunteer at an art gallery and join a book club. I just like to check in occasionally, like we did last year when we didn’t meet for almost a full year and only texted or called every so often. That was totally fine with me. But it sounds like you’re not interested in any form of connection moving forward. If that’s the case, I’ll respect it. Take care and good luck with everything.”  

Her reply was short and final:  

""I think it's best if we go our separate ways, I too wish you all the best. Thank you for the wonderful years.”

Why I’m Struggling 
1. The Suddenness: Everything seemed normal until her dismissive response. There was no fight, no warning, no explanation.  
2. The Mixed Messages: She called our years “wonderful” but ended the friendship abruptly. It feels insincere.  
3. The Lack of Closure: I don’t understand what changed. Was it something I did? Was she only my friend out of pity when I was struggling (unemployed, grieving)? Now that I have a job, pets, and stability, does she feel like I don’t “need” her anymore?  

---

Additional Context
- Our Friendship History: We’ve been through so much together. She was there for me after my dad’s death, and I was there for her through toxic relationships and job struggles.  
- Her Recent Behavior: She’s been dismissive and cold, but there were no signs of this before this conversation in March. In fact, she texted me about a job opportunity and asked about my pets just weeks before this happened.  
- Her Current Life: She’s in PA school, working full-time, and she has a part time low hour side gig. I get that she’s busy, and I respect that, but her response felt unnecessarily harsh.  

---
 My Questions for Reddit
1. Am I Missing Something? Could I have unintentionally done something to upset her?  
2. Was She Only My Friend Out of Pity? Her support during my unemployment and grief felt genuine, but now I’m questioning everything.  
3. How Do I Move On? I’m hurt and confused, but I don’t want to dwell on this forever.  

---

**TL;DR**: My best friend of 8+ years abruptly ended our friendship after I suggested we might run together in the future. She claimed we’d “just hung out a month ago” (it was actually two months) and gave unsolicited advice about my life. I’m hurt and confused—was it something I did, or is this about her own issues?

1j7l0mr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j7l0mr,This weekend I ran from the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia to the 9/11 memorial in NYC!!!!,"What a run! This was a training run for Cocodona 250 coming up in May. The purpose of this run was to stack the deck against my friend (who is also running cocodona) and I. We wanted to come into this run being beat up and run down in order to simulate what we might feel like on our self half of the 250. Leading up to our run I did HIIT classes (5am) every day, ran almost 20 miles throughout the week, worked all day Friday and got up at my usually time of 4:30. Usually when you run a 100 miler you will taper the week leading to the race but this time I wanted to load my week vs taper. 
This run was really special to me for a few different reasons. The starting and ending points are both special to be because I’m a USMC Combat Vet who enlisted in December 2001 and the terrorist attacks of 9/11 confirmed my decision to join the Marines and fight in Iraq. Also being a proud American the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall is very significant to me too. I have been wanting to do this run for a while and this past weekend it came to fruition. 
The starting and end points were great but the route was not the best. For the first half we traversed one impoverish area and neighborhood after another. Every now and then we would be in a nice area but it was not the norm. We went through the rough spots of Philly, Trenton, Rahway, New Brunswick, and Staten Island. A lot of the roads were very busy with little shoulder and it was very sketchy. We did however go through some areas and had some nice back roads too. Those areas were really amazing and we really enjoyed those parts. 
Mentally this 100+ miler was a lot harder versus other 100’s I’ve done. It was tough going into it exhausted but I know that I would grow as a runner and endurance athlete. I had to dig in deep and fight out of some dark spots. I had to stay positive even when the times got tough! 
The temperature was really good at night too. The wind gusts were not fun especially when we were on top of the Gothles, Bayonne, and George Washington bridges. All of these things added to the personal growth and mental fortitude that I was looking for during this run. 
As I mentioned I was up since Friday at 0430 and it wasn’t until Sunday morning at 0400 (47.5 hours) that I continued to run until my battery just had enough. We stopped at Jersey City hospital and we crashed out for 45-60 min in the lobby. I asked the security guard if we could hang out for a bit and told him where we were running from and to and he was able to let us hang there for a while. So grateful! 
Another moment of gratitude was when we got off the Gothles bridge and my friend was in a rough spot. His feet were killin him and we were both cold to the bone. The Port Authority PD allowed us to warm up in their lobby and they even brought us some coffee. Honestly moments like that really fills my heart! 
We did a lot of walking and I was fine with that because her second half of Cocodona I would imagine there will be a lot of walking and time on feet conditioning and training will be very important so it was perfect training. It took us over 41h30m for complete 122.85 miles and I’m really happy with that. We did that mentally and physically fatigued and it just reminded us that we have grit and intestinal fortitude! 
Lastly if you are still reading the most important part of this run was the fact that we were raising money for a veterans nonprofit called Semper Fi and Americas Fund! Semper Fi and Americas Fund (SFAF) has helped me when I was at some of my lowest parts and has helped me transform those lows into life changing highs. If you are able to donate and support SFAF that would be so incredible and I would be so grateful. You would be helping a cause that’s so much bigger than yourself and it would help change the lives of others who have risked their lives and health so that we can life safe and sound in America. If you can spare the price of your coffee that would make a huge difference!! https://thefund.org/upcoming-events/48-hours-for-the-fund/

I just want to say thank you to everyone who has donated and encouraged me along that way! Enjoy the photos of my wild runventure!

My husband and I are wanting an espresso set up at home and need some recommendations for something that wont require a mortgage payment but reliable and consistent.  
I’ve been working in coffee shops for about two years now and am used to the big ol’ 20 thousand dollar industrial machines that hook up to the main waterline. My husband has little to no experience with good espresso machines.  The at home ones I’ve used were a nightmare. One that I used had a built in grinder that would clog up every third pull even after repeated adjustments to the grinder settings (I was working on it every morning for two hours and had to take apart the grinder). Two others were completely manual and had to stop the machine of the espresso will keep poring (literally just turning a nob for water flow). 
I’d prefer to have the grinder and espresso machine separate. 
I’ve read that gaggia classic pro is a pretty good machine coupled with the eureka mignon manual grinder. 
We’ve also looked at the La Specialista Arte Evo Espresso Machine but most reviews range between it’s an absolute waste of money and it’s a pretty good all in one machine. 
I’ll update the next time I work with the name of the machine and grinder I use there.

Transforming your outdoor space into a vibrant retreat is easy with a patio furniture set boho style. This aesthetic is characterized by a laid-back, eclectic vibe, blending various textures, colors, and designs that invite relaxation and creativity. Choosing a boho patio furniture set can elevate your outdoor decor while providing a comfortable area for gatherings or solitude.

When selecting a patio furniture set boho style, look for materials that encapsulate the essence of bohemian design. Natural elements like rattan, wicker, and wood are common choices, creating an organic feel that harmonizes beautifully with outdoor settings. Additionally, adding cushions and throws in vivid patterns and earthy tones introduces warmth and personality.

Opt for a combination of lounge chairs, ottomans, and low coffee tables that encourage easy socializing. A distinctive feature of boho decor is layering; mixing different seating styles can create a visually appealing, inviting atmosphere. Consider incorporating poufs or hammocks for added comfort and style, making your patio a cozy nook for reading or sipping beverages.

- **Decorative Pillows:** Bright, patterned pillows enhance comfort and visual interest.
- **Textured Rugs:** Outdoor rugs with unique textures can define spaces and add softness.
- **Lighting:** String lights or lanterns promote a warm ambiance for evening relaxation.

Incorporating a patio furniture set boho style not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of your outdoor area but also encourages a lifestyle of leisure and enjoyment. Embrace the bohemian spirit and create a personalized retreat that reflects your individual style while celebrating the beauty of nature.

Hello future friends! It’s been a crazy, great week! I was off for three days from my main job (which might never happen again), and I made the most of it. For some backstory—I’m an EDM musician, recently moved back to town, dropped a few new releases, and have more in the works.

I’m always down for a meet-up—coffee, bar, club—but juggling a few jobs means I can’t always make it out. Still, this week has been solid. Met a string of new people, had early coffee this morning in the Strip, and hosted nine guests at my BnB—nine more people to meet, haha.

On top of that, looks like I’m closing one of my contracts this week, which means I can finally drop one of my jobs and free up more time—so why not celebrate? I’m also looking to make new friends, so if anyone’s down to grab a drink or an evening coffee and just hang out, let’s make it happen.

I had a mouth and neck surgery on 15th February. It was a four hour long surgery which has temporarily changed my voice (people can’t understand anything I say), I have difficulty eating and drinking, very weak and immunocompromised.
I was in the hospital for over 1.5 months before the surgery and for 10 days after the surgery.
I have been on a liquid diet or bland soft food diet after my surgery and have been craving for all kinds of food. I had expressed this to my partner and my father. I had also told them that I might be spiralling into depression.

A week after being discharged from the hospital ,my partner visited me (we stay in different cities) with his friend. They ordered in all kinds of delicacies. My partner and my father  never bothered to offer me any food or check in on me. I eventually had a meltdown as my father and my partner were eating amazing Indian food for a late lunch. I was feeling weak and  had only an egg since morning.
I could not express myself calmly and I was crying hysterically. I threw stuff and asked them to leave my house. I told them that they were selfish and did not really care about me.

I was extremely angry when my father and my partner asked me why I could not order in food myself. I had to remind them that I was on a bland soft food diet (no spices/ no pepper) and it was almost impossible to order in anything.  

I also pointed out that during my stay at the hospital my father and my partner always prioritised their food and sleep over my well being. I told my partner that on one occasion I was going to have a painful procedure , I was scared to death and he decided to leave me and went for a coffee break. I also told him that he was on an hour long call with his mentor when I was crying and having difficulty breathing. But I also thanked them for taking care of my dog and ensuring the home was clean. I had thanked them even before this incident 

My partner has stopped talking to me , called off the wedding which was scheduled next month.He also said that I like drama and that I was an ungrateful prick. 

I tried explaining my situation to my father and my partner. My father initially understood my condition but later said that I ruined my relationship over a meal.

My partner also called me an asshole for not articulating my needs clearly. I feel very confused about this situation. My brain has been strongly telling me not to apologise but I am also worried that this will cause my partner to never talk to me again.",2,1741562566.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

We met in April 2024 when I travelled to see my best friend. We went on a date and it was amazing. You came to see me in July - stayed with me for 3 weeks - we went to Norway. Did some hiking. Ate good food. Had good conversations. It was perfect. 

We planned a trip in Early October. But a hurricane hit you - but we found a new date to meet again. In November - I landed and saw you - I couldn’t have been happier as I hugged you at the gate. When we got back to your apartment, there was a slightly strange feeling - there was no “we haven’t seen each other in 3 months sex”, or any cuddling with a film that evening on the couch. You didn’t come to bed with me - instead you explained it’s normal for you to fall asleep on the couch. 

I shook it off - and we went to Orlando for the Epcot festival. It was such an amazing weekend - I met your friends for the first time (properly) and we had a great time. Going for dinner with them. I got to meet their extended family too.

The next day we did the festival - it was hot and busy, but you were smiling and having a good time - it made me happy. We then got wasted drunk that night with your friends. But you didn’t seem to want to spend time with me…you would put your arms around your friend but wouldn’t hold my hand - you would slap their backside playfully, but wouldn’t put your arms around me. 

I shook it off - we went back to the city, where you live, and we continued business as usual - it was almost as if we had lived together for 30 years; life mundane. In fairness, you had work, and I had assignments to do, but it felt empty. We would go for walks, trips to the store, and the odd beach evening, but nothing more than that - no cuddling on the couch, or in bed (including intimate time). 

The next weekend, we went to Atlanta, Georgia. It was such a beautiful city, and one you were so fond of having lived there for a long time. You were so excited, telling me about your time there - showing me all the places that used to be mere memories but have now changed to sky scrapers or another Starbucks. It was a perfect city break - we then drove some 2 hours to do some hiking in the Georgian mountains. A perfect weekend under the stars, a camp fire going. It should have been the most romantic evening - but still, no romantic gestures, no nothing. 

We left, going back to your home - again. Business as usual. We spend a few days in - the odd walk here and there. My trip is nearly coming to an end. I ask you “why haven’t we been remotely intimate since my being here!” And you say we’ll talk about it soon. “Let’s go to the beach and watch the sunset”. You say. 

The next day. You bring it up - you say you feel we’ve moved from partners to friends. I was devastated. Clutching at any straw that you might take back what you just said to me - words that sent me spiralling. He’s breaking up with me - we’re sat at a coffee shop. And he’s breaking up with me….

I hold back my tears - my stomach churning and my chest aching. You say you’re sorry - as a tear rolls down my face. When we get up, we go back to your place - I’m not sure if you’re as upset as I am, or relieved that you finally said it. I immediately sit on your balcony, door closed, as you go back to work. 

I’m sat in the sun, crying…on my own. You come out a short while later. And give me a hug. The first bit of contact with you I’ve had this whole trip. I cry hard into your stomach. And you say you’re sorry - but somehow. Your words don’t mean a thing to me in that moment. Otherwise you wouldn’t be breaking my heart right now. But you’re sweet at the same time - you take the day off work to console me. And we talk about everything. You try to tell me why, but for some reason, it doesn’t translate..

“I want to do new things with my life. And I feel we’ve become really good friends rather than partners - you still mean a lot to me and I’d love to continue being friends - I don’t want to not be in your life” ~ words to the effect of…

That night, we still sleep in different rooms, and I’m still heart broken. When I leave you at the airport a couple days later - I yelp. And scream when I’m alone in the monorail. Gut wrenching. Never felt a worse feeling. This is heartbreak. 

4 months have passed….

We texted each other often in the first couple of months. Checking in with each other and having some light conversation. It feels good to talk to you still.

some of my clothes still smell of your detergent though - I couldn’t unpack my bag from the trip - it hurt too much. It still does…

Today, as I’m writing this, We haven’t messaged in a month. You’re getting on with your life and I’m just about getting on with mine. We said we’d be friends forever. But our friendship feels like it’s fading and I’ve got no control over it. 

I feel a new level of heartbreak. I care so much for you. And miss you every day. But do you miss me? Do you still think of me too? Or am I just a fading memory?…

I miss you…

Quick notes on what worked for me:

Getting Interviews:
- Include a one sentence summary of your scope of role before your accomplishments.
- Quantity of applications matters more than quantity.  I completed ~250.
- Buy LinkedIn premium and proactively contact recruiters.  If they are in your area buy them a coffee.  My interviews for Block, and Gusto were a direct result of this.

Prep
- DSA
- System Design
- Behavioral

DSA:
- Grokking coding interview patterns.
- Recently asked LeetCode prep.  Try to answer questions asked by targets in 90 days. Not always possible.  Do your best.
- USE YOUR RE-ROLL.  If you’re in a coding screen and you get a problem you know you can’t solve tell the interviewer that you solved it recently.  You’ll probably get another.

 System Design
- Designing Data Intensive Systems
- The Google SRE Book for Senior+
- Microservice patterns
- System Design insiders guide Vol 2. Vol 1 is not relevant for Senior+.
- Hello Interview for practice
- If you are below Senior and not cloud architect certified this is probably the best practice you can get.
- Skim ALL of the docs for one relational database, one KV database,
Elastic search, Redis (it’s so versatile), one message queue like Rabbit, NATS, or Kafka

Behavioral:
- Write a one page narrative for every major project that may come up in STAR format.  Recall as much detail as possible.  Include a brief description of your team and how it fits into business at the top.  Don’t memorize.  Just priming your working memory.

General:
-  Take care of yourself.  Eat well.  Go do fun stuff with friends and family.  Try not to take rejection personally.

however, i recently finally cracked and used treasure islands/time travel to help decorate because it was just taking too long… now that i’ve had access to basically do whatever i want with the game, i realize that this game has quite a lot of flaws. i am sure there is a bunch of post like this but i need to dump all my frustrations somewhere!! maybe there’s even something i am missing that folks can help me with 

in no particular order, my qualms: 

- the lack of inclusion of such iconic characters. i know i just mentioned i have enjoyed time traveling but man, i kind of miss resetti. i feel like there must be some way to include his character creatively with the new horizons format 
-speaking of missing being yelled at, the villagers are SO boring. where is the personality, the drama!! the animals are supposed to be the appeal of the game, can they please give me more than a 5 word sentence 
-also why do they barely interact with anything on the island??? i’ve curated this beautiful island for them with so much seating but they always prefer to sit on the floor. it drives me crazy. i’ve also played pocket camp and the interactions both with characters and furniture is so so so much more fun on that platform
-i really don’t care for my role as island representative… for lack of a better way to phrase this… i want to be god. i want to able to decorate and move things on the island with a lot more ease. or at least, i need a lot less talking interruptions/pop up screens. like why can’t i lay down customized paths a lot more easier??  
-same thing goes for crafting/cooking/customization. why can’t i just mass produce 
-also if you’re at a diy station/kitchen, you should be able to access your storage. the back and forth is so annoying 
-things to do on the island are LACKING. i wish we could work up nook’s cranny to become a resort mall with a lot more places to visit or an addition to harv’s island where shops there have the option to move to the island to offer a lot more services. also back to my point of bringing back iconic characters: gracie would absolutely slay a tropical boutique or something of the sort. 
-addition of mini games would be great. the fishing tourneys and the bug offs get old so quick. 
-the museum is a snooze too — again, many possibilities for mini games or at least something to do. you should be able to do more than just get coffee from brewster, and i find it an absolute crime that there is no space dedicated to celeste. the island backdrop is literally the perfect excuse to ALWAYS be stargazing 
-also if gyroids spawn pretty regularly, there should be more to do than just display them. again, missed opportunity to include brewster in a more active role on the island, or perhaps they could have done more with the gyroid guy that pops up for bridges/inclines 
-the dlc is probably the best part of the game, however, still feels really limiting at times. i wish happy home academy scoring was implemented into the designing aspects of happy home paradise 
-decorating itself feels limiting at times too. there should be a lot more room for customization especially with the partitions oh my god it makes me me so mad you can’t give it its own wallpaper or hang anything on them
-also get with the times, give me convenient furniture ordering. okay maybe it doesn’t have to be delivered immediately, but we should canonize same day shipping in acnh, give nook the power or build out what reese & cyrus have to offer 

i feel like there’s plenty more i can say but of course i’m blanking. i’d be so interested to hear what others have to say about the flaws they find in acnh and what they wish was different/included. 

also wanted to include my dream address! 
DA-0892-5438-4355

spent the last month redoing my island, it was a lot of fun. would love feedback as to what i should do/improve to make the game worth continuing to play. accidentally did the bell glitch so making money is not as fun, and i haven’t had much luck completing my museum’s fish & bugs. the creating is definitely my favorite part of the game so would love to keep going with that!

So my husband, myself and my BIL moved into the neighborhood recently in January. It's pretty quiet here and peaceful except for us a little, but I swear we are not trying to be bad neighbors. Two days ago my husband was coming home and there was this ""lady"" who had fallen along the road. Being the gentleman he is, he stopped to help her out and make sure she was OK. Ended up she lives a few spots down from us so he drove her home. Later that day she shows up. I meet her, she is a little ""off"" but seems ok it was weird she kept hugging me and was trying to hug my husband it was really weird, so we talk a little she goes home. At this point I am thinking I now know 3 women in the neighborhood cool.  I dont know anyone here  and am new to the area its a goodthing maybe we can do a book club or something. Yesterday we wake up to someone beating the door really hard, we're saying who the heck is beating on our door this early in the morningon a Saturday. It's her. My husband had me go to a door because he didn't want to be rude to a lady.  He is a true southern gentleman wrapped up in a blue collar package, but goes out of his way to never be disrespectful of women in anyway but he is pissed. Being the brutally honest man he  says what he thinks and feels and you can be ok with that or not it doesn't matter either way to him thats your problem. So I reluctantly go. I answered the door, she is wanting to go to the store. Needing to  do my errands I agree she can go with me. Its barely 7 am, I told her I would be a few minutes she sat down on the patio and immediatly starts barking orders demanding me to adjust the umbrella so she doesn't get burnt by the sun I am a redhead so I get hiding from the sun, then ordered me to bring her a drink and hurry up about it. I was a good host not cursing her off as I really wanted to being respectful of elders. Dang those Southern bell manners my Grams taught me. I told her I would be a few minutes getting dressed and getting my husband's day started but I wouldn't take too long. I started to make some instant coffee, wash my face, and throw on some an shorts offit maybe 10-15 time needed tops. She was banging on the side of our house every few minutes complaining I was too slow. While I was getting ready my husband and I had had a quick talk and agreed that this is a 1 time arrangement because she was being ridiculous. Finally I am ready and she wanted me to somehow hoist her up like my husband did to get her in the truck.  I am a little bitty thing, tall at 5' 9 in, but only 140 lbs, let alone 51 years, and disabled, this is going to be interesting she out weighs me by at least 20 lbs and i am this tall skinny woman. She then started fussing that husbands truck so big and made it tricky to get in. I  laughed, agreed and  told her she was preaching to the choir i knew all about it. Quickly I gave her quick simple instructions on how to get in the truck. To put her left foot on the rail and stand up then sit down. She of course stepped up with her right foot which twists your body in the wrong direction making it impossible to now get in the truck I know i did this everyday for weeks before I figured it out. She's in. Time to go. We live about a 10 miles from the big blue store, straight shot, easy drive. Music was playing, its a good drive, she reachs into her bag and pulls out a huge bottle of wine and starts chugging. Now we don't drink anything stronger than Dr. Pepper in our house and we deffinatly dont drink alchol in our vehicles never have. Flabbergasted, thinking this woman has an open container in our truck, while I am driving in a heavy patroled area (military base with a large town that it butts upto it so there is MPs to your left and county and local pd everwhere)I am starting to feel uncomfortable with the situation worried i was going to get pulled over because of this woman and have unnecessary wasting thier and my time, heck could I get a ticket, this woman could  be wanted and I don't know it. That bag she carries is huge, I  know she has that wine in there what else could be in that bag. Needless my anxiety was through the roof. We get to the store she goes off on a handicap cart, saying she is going to grab a few things and will wait by checkout for me right here upfront. I reminded her if she needed me my number was in her phone under Baby Girl and my husbands was there and i knew she knew his name, but I didn't want her to need me and not be able to get me. 30 minutes later, my husband calls.  He has been called into work and I  need to come home ASAP. OK on the way. I grabbed a bag of cat food and headed for the front, it's been maybe 35-40 minutes she should be done. She wasn't at the front. I waited a few minutes then started searching the store. I had saved my # into her phone and my husbands, but had forgotten to add hers to mine Oy. So I searched the store several times over, my husband calls back babe I gotta go, maybe she is waiting in the truck. I check out go to the truck, she is not there, I put everything in the truck, and headed back  inside. Searching the store for at least another 30 minutes she is no where to be found.  My husband was wanting me to just leave, but I didn't want to strand the lady in town with no way home. Needless to say it caused a problem. He suggested to try paging her, so off to customer service I go. On the way  I remembered I don't know her full name, she has been calling me Baby Girl (what my husband calls me) she won't know my propper name either, since she hadn't shut up long enough to learn it.  Speaking with the manager explaining my weird complicated situation. The manager knew exactly who i was missing she had left the store over 2 hours before to meet up with friends for a party she was telling everyone in line drunk. She also is suspected of drinking in there store. Realizing she didn't even try to let me know she was leaving, just made her purchases and FU I am out of here, like I am a fn Uber driver. I had been searching frantically for hours not wanting to leave my neighbor 10 miles from home trying to be decent and she didn't even have the integrity  to thank me, and say  I am leaving with my friends see you in the neighborhood, nothing. My husband had to miss work, costing us extra income we really need right now, so he wasn't happy this had happened. I drove home and we salvaged what we could of our day. Few hours later, we see her walking to our house. I  met her in the front yard told her 5 times to leave politely. She refused. My husband came out and also nicely asked her to leave, why we wanted her to leave and that she should and to not return ever. She kept on and he bellowed LEAVE. She left. Good story over..
This morning my husband leaves for work I sleep in a little. My BIL who has a tramatic brain injury lives with us.  Evidently when she knocked on the door, he recognized from the day before. He thought it was ok to let her in the house since she wanted to come in really bad. I woke up and heard a woman's voice and didn't think anything about it's just the TV.  I walked around the corner and she is sitting on my couch. Trying not to lose my cool, I asked her what part of leave and not come back did you not understand, get out of my house now. This woman had the audacity to tell me  no in my house and refused to leave. I am faced with 2 choices, go Old School on her or call the police. I went with the police, she continued to refuse to go with the non emergency police officer on the phone. I told her to leave, they are telling her to leave, she continued to refuse to go, so they were going to send a patrol car. I finally had had my fill of this chick, i started screaming go now, go out of my mf house or I am going to put you outside physically and then I am still going to press charges when they get here. She finally left, gosh I hope she doesn't come banging on the door in the morning, this woman is obsessive and it was freaking me out a little. The poor police officer was very kind she told me she would put the call in the log, as a record of me telling her to leave. So now the house is quiet, my BIL is ok and now understands this chick isn't welcome under any circumstances please don't let her in again, stay away from her and let us know if you see her coming or hear her voice. 

So we are dealing with this woman who's personality reminds us of Glen Close character in Fatal Attraction with a platonic association at best twist added in to switch it up a little bit. 

I am wondering if she gets it, don't care,  has a psychiatric issue or ment deffect  or is she  so inebriated she doesn't remember. Maybe all the above.

Sorry it was kinda longin

I’m a minor, my life’s a flaming trash heap, and this tale’s got screaming maids, dead dogs, and a robbery that’d make a sitcom writer blush. (Yes, this all happened and is not made up) 

I’m a kid (age redacted for drama), and my existence is a runaway garbage truck smashing through every red light—I’m the driver, the trash, and the guy yelling “why me?!” at the wreckage. Saturday night rolls in, and I’m popping a couple of sleep pills like they’re candy, hoping to dodge my usual insomnia hell. I crash around 11 p.m., dreaming of peace—until 4 a.m., when I’m jolted awake by my house help shrieking, “There’s a man trying to kill me!” over and over like a broken alarm clock. I’m groggy as hell, brain still half-melted from the pills, and I fumble for my phone to use as a flashlight. Plot twist: it’s gone. I figure it’s yeeted itself under the bed, so I stumble toward my door in the dark.
I shove the door, but it’s jammed—only cracks open enough for me to poke my head out like a confused meerkat. Hallway light’s blazing, and I spot a stack of chairs barricading me in. I’m skinny as a noodle, so I muscle it open a smidge more, wriggle through, and clamber over a chair like it’s a low-budget obstacle course. I stagger into the living room, and there’s my maid, bouncing up and down, still yelling her lungs out. This whole circus unfolds in, what, three minutes? I’m dazed, but I grab her shoulders, and get her to simmer down. We bolt to her room (closest safe spot) and lock ourselves in for 10 minutes while I ask her what the hell is going on.
She spills the tea: two dudes invaded the house then invaded her room. One’s looming in the doorway, the other’s hovering over her with a knife raised, mid-debate with his buddy like it’s a casual “stab or nah?” meeting. She wakes up, clocks the blade, and starts screaming bloody murder—smart move cause it spooks them off, cueing my wake-up call. So, piecing this nightmare together, and decide to fetch our gate man. We step outside, and bam—there’s my dog, dead as a doornail, sprawled like a grim welcome mat. My heart sinks, I loved that dog. Gate man’s snoring through the apocalypse, door locked tight, so we pound on it like desperate drummers for a solid few minutes til he stumbles out, bleary-eyed and useless.
Back in the living room, I tell him to call Dad’s buddy, who lives a hot minute away, for advice. Buddy’s like, “Chill til 8 a.m. before bugging your dad—he’s on a work trip, and you’re not bleeding, so no rush.” It’s 5 a.m. now, and my pill haze drags me under—I pass out on the sofa while the house help and gate man mumble in the background like a late-night podcast I didn’t sign up for. I blink awake at 7 a.m., still phone-less (turns out the thieves snagged it, along with my maid’s), so gate boy dials Dad. Dad’s orders: hit the police station, file a report, then swing by the service provider to grab temp phones and resurrect our SIMs—all a breezy 10-minute stroll away. Why no 911? Where I live, cops are less “heroic saviors” and more “paperwork goblins”—slow as molasses, stressful as tax season, and none of us even know the damn emergency number. Cool system, right?
We trudge to the station, and the cops—yawning through their coffee—muse that it’s probably a neighborhood lurker who’s been stalking us, picking Saturday night cause Sunday mornings are for sleeping in, not crime-solving. Brilliant. So here I am, robbed, dog-less, and wondering if my life’s a cosmic prank.

I've had my pico for a month now, and up until yesterday I've been using the included 18g basket. I'm using a kingrinder k6 and typically have the grind somewhere around the 28-30 mark, which is extracting 36g in around 35 seconds. So far so good.

I've recently purchased the 12g basket, as I'm coming from a moka pot background, and the 18g produces more coffee that I actually want. For the last 2 days I've been using the 12g basket with the same grind settings, around 29 clicks, and the shot is running through really quickly, 24g in around 12 seconds. I assumed the change in basket size wouldn't require any changes to grind fineness, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Understanding the difference between coffee and espresso can enhance your coffee experience. Coffee is brewed by dripping hot water over ground beans, producing a lighter and larger drink. Espresso, on the other hand, is made by forcing hot water through finely-ground beans at high pressure, resulting in a small, strong shot.

This distinction affects not only the taste but also the caffeine content and overall experience. By learning these differences, you can better appreciate what each drink offers and choose the perfect brew for your mood or needs. Let’s dive deeper into what makes coffee and espresso unique.

# Coffee Vs Espresso

Introduction paragraph about What is the Difference between Coffee And Espresso and Coffee vs Espresso…

# Key Differences

Coffee and espresso are two popular beverages made from coffee beans. Though they share the same origin, they have distinct differences. Understanding these differences can help you choose the right drink for your taste and needs.

Here are the key differences between coffee and espresso:

* **Brewing Method:** Coffee is brewed by dripping water through ground beans, while espresso is made by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee under high pressure.
* **Grind Size:** Coffee uses a coarser grind, while espresso requires a fine grind to create a rich and concentrated flavor.
* **Brewing Time:** Coffee usually takes several minutes to brew. Espresso takes around 25-30 seconds.
* **Serving Size:** A typical serving of coffee is 8-12 ounces, whereas an espresso shot is about 1 ounce.
* **Caffeine Content:** Although espresso has more caffeine per ounce, a cup of coffee usually has more total caffeine due to its larger size.

|Aspect|Coffee|Espresso|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Brewing Method|Drip|Pressure|
|Grind Size|Coarse|Fine|
|Brewing Time|Several minutes|25-30 seconds|
|Serving Size|8-12 ounces|1 ounce|
|Caffeine Content|Less per ounce|More per ounce|

# Flavor Profiles

The flavor profiles of coffee and espresso are another significant difference. Each drink offers a unique taste experience.

Here is what you can expect from each:

* **Coffee:** Coffee typically has a milder flavor, allowing for a wide range of tastes based on the beans and brewing method. It can be fruity, nutty, or even chocolaty.
* **Espresso:** Espresso has a bold and intense flavor. The high pressure and fine grind extract more oils, giving it a rich and concentrated taste. Espresso often has a slightly bitter note with a creamy texture.

Flavor profiles can also be influenced by the type of beans used:

* **Arabica Beans:** These beans are common in both coffee and espresso. They offer a smooth and sweet taste with hints of fruit and sugar.
* **Robusta Beans:** These beans are stronger and more bitter. They are often used in espresso blends for an added kick.

Ultimately, the choice between coffee and espresso comes down to personal preference. Coffee offers a more varied and subtle taste, while espresso provides a quick, robust, and intense flavor.

# Brewing Methods

Understanding the differences between coffee and espresso goes beyond just taste and strength. One key difference lies in their brewing methods. Let’s explore how each beverage is prepared to appreciate their unique qualities.

# Coffee Brewing Techniques

Coffee brewing techniques vary widely, each method offering a distinct flavor profile and experience. Here are some popular methods:

* **Drip Coffee Maker:** This is one of the most common methods. Hot water drips through ground coffee, which is held in a filter. The brewed coffee then drips into a carafe or pot.
* **French Press:** Coarse coffee grounds are steeped in hot water. After a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down to separate the grounds from the liquid.
* **Pour Over:** Hot water is manually poured over coffee grounds in a filter. This method allows for control over the brewing time and water flow.
* **Aeropress:** This method uses air pressure to push hot water through coffee grounds. It’s quick and produces a concentrated coffee.
* **Cold Brew:** Coffee grounds are steeped in cold water for an extended period, usually 12-24 hours. The result is a smooth, less acidic coffee.

Each method involves different grind sizes, water temperatures, and brewing times. These factors influence the final taste and strength of the coffee. Here’s a quick comparison:

|Method|Grind Size|Brewing Time|Water Temperature|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Drip Coffee Maker|Medium|5-10 minutes|195-205°F|
|French Press|Coarse|4 minutes|200°F|
|Pour Over|Medium-Fine|3-4 minutes|200°F|
|Aeropress|Fine|1-2 minutes|175-185°F|
|Cold Brew|Coarse|12-24 hours|Cold|

# Espresso Brewing Process

Espresso is made using a specific and intense brewing method. The process requires an espresso machine, which forces hot water through finely-ground coffee at high pressure. This method results in a concentrated coffee shot with a rich, creamy layer called crema on top.

Here are the key steps:

1. **Grind:** The coffee beans are ground very finely, almost to a powder.
2. **Tamping:** The ground coffee is packed tightly into a portafilter.
3. **Extraction:** The espresso machine forces hot water (around 200°F) through the packed coffee at high pressure (usually 9 bars).
4. **Serving:** The result is a small, concentrated shot of coffee with a strong flavor and aromatic oils.

Espresso machines come in various types, from manual to fully automated. They all share the same goal: to produce a consistent, high-quality espresso shot. The brewing process is quick, typically taking around 25-30 seconds.

Here’s a brief comparison to highlight the differences:

|Aspect|Details|
|:-|:-|
|Grind Size|Very Fine|
|Brewing Time|25-30 seconds|
|Water Temperature|200°F|
|Pressure|9 bars|

Espresso’s unique brewing process creates a bold and concentrated flavor. It serves as the base for many popular coffee drinks, such as lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos.

# Caffeine Content

When discussing the difference between coffee and espresso, one important factor is caffeine content. Caffeine is the main reason many people drink these beverages. It helps you stay alert and awake. But how much caffeine do you get in a cup of coffee versus a shot of espresso? Let’s explore this in detail.

# Caffeine In Coffee

Coffee is a popular choice for many. It provides a steady energy boost. The amount of caffeine in coffee can vary. It depends on the type of beans and the brewing method. Generally, an 8-ounce cup of coffee contains about 95 milligrams of caffeine. But this can range from 70 to 140 milligrams.

Several factors influence the caffeine content in coffee:

* **Type of Beans:** Arabica beans have less caffeine than Robusta beans.
* **Roast Level:** Darker roasts have slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts.
* **Brewing Method:** Methods like drip coffee, French press, and cold brew can affect caffeine levels.

Here’s a simple table to show the caffeine content in different types of coffee:

|Type of Coffee|Caffeine Content (mg)|
|:-|:-|
|Drip Coffee|95|
|French Press|80-100|
|Cold Brew|150-200|

As you can see, the caffeine content varies. So, choosing the right coffee depends on how much caffeine you need.

# Caffeine In Espresso

Espresso is a strong, concentrated coffee. It is made by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans. A single shot of espresso (about 1 ounce) contains around 63 milligrams of caffeine. This may seem less than a cup of coffee, but remember, espresso is served in much smaller quantities.

Factors affecting caffeine in espresso:

* **Grind Size:** Finer grounds can lead to higher caffeine extraction.
* **Brew Time:** A longer brew time can increase caffeine content.
* **Pressure:** Higher pressure in the espresso machine can extract more caffeine.

To compare, here’s a quick table showing caffeine content:

|Espresso Type|Caffeine Content (mg)|
|:-|:-|
|Single Shot|63|
|Double Shot|126|

Espresso packs a punch in a small volume. This makes it a favorite for those needing a quick caffeine boost.

In summary, coffee and espresso offer different experiences. Coffee provides a moderate caffeine boost over a longer period. Espresso delivers a quick, concentrated dose.

# Grind Size

Understanding the difference between coffee and espresso starts with the grind size. The grind size plays a vital role in determining the flavor, strength, and overall quality of your brew. A coarse grind is used for coffee, while a fine grind is essential for espresso. These differences in grind size result in unique brewing methods and distinct tastes.

# Coarse Grind For Coffee

A coarse grind is typically used for brewing coffee. This grind size resembles sea salt or breadcrumbs. The larger particles are perfect for slow brewing methods, allowing water to flow through the coffee grounds more freely. This process extracts the flavors gradually, resulting in a smoother and less bitter taste.

Here are some popular brewing methods that use a coarse grind:

* **French Press:** A popular method where the coarse grounds steep in hot water for a few minutes before being pressed down with a plunger.
* **Cold Brew:** Involves steeping coarse coffee grounds in cold water for an extended period, usually 12-24 hours, to produce a smooth, rich flavor.
* **Percolator:** Uses steam pressure to push water through the coarse grounds, which then filters back down through the coffee multiple times.

The table below highlights key differences in brewing time and flavor profile:

|Brewing Method|Brewing Time|Flavor Profile|
|:-|:-|:-|
|French Press|4-5 minutes|Rich, full-bodied|
|Cold Brew|12-24 hours|Smooth, mild|
|Percolator|7-10 minutes|Strong, robust|

Using a coarse grind for coffee ensures that the water extracts the flavors at an optimal rate. This results in a balanced and enjoyable cup of coffee.

# Fine Grind For Espresso

A fine grind is essential for making espresso. This grind size is much smaller, resembling powdered sugar or table salt. The finer particles allow for a higher surface area, which is crucial for the quick extraction process in espresso machines.

Key points about fine grind for espresso:

* **Extraction Time:** Espresso is brewed under high pressure for a short time, usually 25-30 seconds.
* **Flavor Concentration:** The fine grind ensures that the water extracts a concentrated, intense flavor, producing a rich and robust shot of espresso.
* **Crema:** The fine grind helps create the signature crema, a golden layer of foam on top of the espresso shot.

The table below compares espresso with other coffee types:

|Coffee Type|Grind Size|Brewing Time|Flavor Profile|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Espresso|Fine|25-30 seconds|Bold, intense|
|Drip Coffee|Medium|4-6 minutes|Balanced, smooth|
|French Press|Coarse|4-5 minutes|Rich, full-bodied|

Using a fine grind for espresso ensures that the high-pressure water extracts the maximum flavor in a short time. This results in a strong and aromatic espresso shot.

1j7kap5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j7kap5/technology_catch_up/,Technology catch up?,"After a bit of research about flagship dual boiler prosumer models, I’m astonished to see the fast pace of innovation lately which seems more like a technological catch up. Perhaps because there’s no need to change a winning formula for commercial machines, but the increase of amateur home baristas may have required more up to date tech for quality of life and ease of use for non-professionals. 
 
For instance :
- the new Synchronika II, currently on preorder, adopts heating cartridges to shorten the E61 warm up time down to 7 minutes. We’ve been using cartridge heating with thermistors and PID for over two decades to quickly heat 3d printer heads (which is a big block of nickel plated copper for temperature stability just like the group head ). 
- small OLED displays have been extremely affordable during the last 3 years. Touchscreen E-ink displays are also widespread but so far no manufacturer adopted it.
- a seven-segment display to show the shot timer was probably available when man landed on the moon!
- a precise Chinese coffee scale is so affordable that everyone has one, however a machine with an integrated, waterproof scale is nowhere to be found, let alone one that reads the extraction weight to refine the brewing profile, except for a $10,000+ professional La Marzocco. 
- brass is the top tier metal for heat exchange applications in terms of its cost effectiveness (silver would be even better if weren’t for the higher price) , so why Synchronika adopts steel boilers? Steel can absorb like 15% more heat than copper meaning slightly more stable temperature but it is pretty bad (slower) to conduct , or “exchange” heat with water compared to brass. 
- group head “temperature offset” is set manually but a $1 thermistor at the shower screen or even in the portafilter would suffice to automatically adjust the temperature offset. 

These questions are not to be taken as critics at all, it’s just legitimate curiosity from a broken mechanical engineering nerd dipping his toes in the prosumer market to justify spending a small fortune to get consistent and balanced shots every morning. Note: I just bought a decent grinder and will spend the next months using my same old Breville barista to improve the extraction as much as I can before asking my tongue whether she’s still unhappy as she is now, to justify buying an entirely new machine.

Folks, let me tell you something. Arch Linux? It’s not just good, it’s the BEST. The BEST. Other distros? They’re a total JOKE. Embarrassments. Ubuntu? Bloated, it’s a DISASTER. Fedora? A complete WASTE of space. Debian? OLD, so OLD. 
Windows? I’d rather run my business on a potato-powered Raspberry Pi with dial-up internet. 
You know it, I know it, everybody knows it—Arch is for WINNERS. It’s a FACT. 

People say, ‘You can’t install it without guides!’ WRONG. People talk about Linux like they know what they’re doing. They don’t. I installed it myself—no guides, no wikis, no YouTube tutorials. Just me, the terminal, and a whole lot of AMERICAN EXCELLENCE.

No one installs packages faster. The AUR? INCREDIBLE. It’s like a treasure chest of pure gold. Rolling release? Like a GODDAMN well-oiled machine. NEVER breaks. NEVER. Other distros? They need LTS. They need stability. They need their little training wheels. They need a safety net. SAD!

I’ve been playing osu! for what feels like an eternity, and over the years I’ve discovered that success isn’t just about practice, mods, or even raw skill—it’s also about those quirky little rituals that keep us going. For me, it all started with a coffee mishap that turned into a blessing in disguise. One fateful day, I spilled my coffee all over my setup (yikes!), and while cleaning up the mess I stumbled upon a surprising revelation: my caffeine buzz somehow calmed my nerves and sharpened my timing.

Since then, I’ve been a loyal advocate of my pre-game coffee ritual. And if that wasn’t enough, I decided to take it up a notch by adopting a little rubber duck as my “osu! charm.” I know, it sounds absurd—but on those days when I nail a near-impossible combo, I swear I owe half of it to my lucky duck and the perfect cup of joe.
