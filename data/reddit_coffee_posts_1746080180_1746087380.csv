And why do people do strange things like this?,"I (46M) was talking to one of the mums (43F) at the school about our boys weekend sport. Whilst chatting, she asked me how long I had been single and what I did when I didn’t have the kids. We have always had each other’s number to arrange activities for the kids the last few years and she asked if she could message me. So that night, there were multiple messages exchanged and she asked me if I wanted to catch up for a coffee during one of my midweek days off and I said yes and plans were then made. She cancelled on the day and has sent maybe 2 messages since (7 days ago). I have left it and not pressed for anything but what are the reasons for this?

1kc3jgp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kc3jgp,Iced pour over finally tastes right – this recipe changed everything,"I used to struggle with iced pour over, always tasting diluted or flat. After a lot of trial and error, this simple recipe finally gave me the clarity, body, and chill I wanted. I'm hooked.

Recipe:

Coffee: 16g (medium-fine grind)
Ice: 70g (in the carafe)
Hot water: 150g at 91°C

Instructions:

1. Add 70g of ice to your server or carafe. Pre-cool your serving glass with cold water and ice—set aside for later.


2. Add 16g of medium-fine coffee to your dripper.


3. Brew with 150g of hot water (91°C) using your preferred pour-over method.


4. Swirl the carafe gently and wait until all 70g of ice has melted completely.


5. Drain the water from your serving glass (from step 1); keep the ice. Pour and enjoy.

Important notes:

1. Do not pour from the carafe until all the ice has melted.

2. Pre-cooling the serving glass ensures that no more ice melts during drinking, so don't miss this step.

3. I use 65–75 clicks on a Kingrinder K6 for a Burundi light roast. Your grind may vary—explore what works best for your beans.


This changed how I see iced pour over. Let me know if you try it or have your own tweaks.",1,1746087097.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

1kc3fv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1kc3fv4/my_funko_pop_collection_just_reached_300_figurines/,My Funko Pop! Collection just reached 300 figurines,"Baudrillard describes the disquieting strangeness of the simulacrum. Clearly, he never saw my Funko Pop! collection.

Take Arya, from Game of Thrones. Every detail, from the slight part in her lips to the inflection of her eyebrows, is perfectly rendered in polyvinyl. Her oval eyes and handpainted pupils suggest contentment—pride, even. 
Staring at her motionless features takes me back to grad school---lounging on the sofa with Jessica, streaming the series on a laptop propped up by  a coffee-stained paperback of *Amérique*.  Then, we never worried about spoilers, or the job market for sociology doctorates with deep expertise in comic book exegesis. Arya eventually left the Kingdom of Westeros, and Jessica left our shared apartment, yet my Collectible ThronesHead Edition© figurine remains a reminder of the past.

Where there are Funkos, there is Being. Hundreds of shrink-wrapped dolls gaze out from the shelves of my collection room. Formerly a nursery, the space guides the eye across years of acquisitions. Each shelf reveals a history—the limited edition Pixar Classics set from 2015, the DC Crossover Webcomic series from 2018. The Teen Titans Revival (2022) commemorative set or the nursing blanket knit by her grandmother (2024) just below it. Instead of a crib, a glass case at the room’s center houses the rarest piece, a limited-edition Spider-Man 3.2 edition, in a classic (pre-1990) blue jumpsuit. *With great power…* reads the faded Sharpie text, signed by the late Stan Lee. A reminder that life, like appraised value, is fleeting.

As the collection grows, minor distinctions grow more important. The 2012 Avengers limited edition set slightly differs from the 2018 Infinity Saga™ series. Cap’s jaw looks softer, kinder now.  When Jessica still visited, she joked that Iron Man’s graying beard undermined the whole time travel mechanic. Before she left, I shaved too. *We are still young, we can try again.* Hulk is now a different shade of green.

As I wrote in my dissertation, we construct our sense of self through opposition to the Other. The yin to our yang, the Hydra to S.H.I.E.L.D., the remaining collection versus the 50% of figurines that the judge awarded her. Like the loss of youth, innocence, what we really mourn is a simulacrum of the past—was the limited edition Shovel Knight Victory Edition (2019) really that special? Do I really miss the Demon Gate (2018) Collector’s edition, or Pepper, the Shih-Tzu we adopted as a practice run? When I feel regret, I scroll through photos from the past ten years—Indiana Jones memorabilia auctions, catalogues of rare Star Trek figures, private preschool brochures, and Dune movie posters. I remember the warm moments, winning the bidding on a Yoshi’s Wooly World glass-encased Koopa Trooper, or lab test results confirming it would be Isabelle, not Ian. The rest of it all shrinks away, like punctured clingfilm, and I am left with my collection, my life’s work.

1kc3f8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1kc3f8z/as_a_queer_woman_who_has_served_ns_how_do_i/,As a queer woman who has served NS; how do I accept that I will always be de-prioritised over new citizens (and in extreme cases even PR's) who did not serve?,"(Tried to post to r Singapore and it got deleted twice and the third time outright hidden. Stay classy, mods.)

A few weeks ago, my partner had a discussion with a fellow sinkie (who is in a straight relationship) about how us queers are regularly fked in this country; especially with regards to housing (the topic originally came about as she was eagerly awaiting her appointment with HDB after a successful BTO ballot). She responded with something to the effect of ""what to do, Singapore is a small country."" I later learned that her fiance is a PR... who never served NS. At work I had a colleague who upon being granted his shiny new citizenship... managed to successfully ballot a BTO... at Bidadari no less (we all know what the resale of this estate is like now). He also never served NS. Meanwhile, I served NS. And I'm a woman. Why? Because I happen to be trans.

I also happen to be in a same-sex relationship. So while the PAP decides I was apparently man enough to serve NS (something something loopholes), I am not good enough to marry the love of my life and jointly BTO a 3/+ room flat together. Mind you this is the same PAP that is more than happy to leave policies in place which allow a lot of PR and new-citizen so-called ""men"" to not serve all in the name of not scaring away the foreigners or some rubbish. I can't even remember anymore.

And time and time again, I see the same common theme.

During my time growing up in this country, I have seen the population climb from 3.5 million... to over 6 million now.

So apparently... we have enough space to almost double the population... but not enough homes for queers, singles, and so on.

At the same time... the PAP always tells us COE supply needs to be constrained... but we have enough space to almost double the population.

And of course... LHL can say we ""cannot keep building new hospitals to meet the growing needs of a rapidly ageing population""... but we have enough space to almost double the population.

Public transport? You know what it is like.

The list just keeps going on and on. And it seems like it's always the fault of us born and bred sinkies... when we aren't the ones rapidly inflating this country's population.

Remember during the height of COVID when we all used to joke ""look another ""Dear Singaporeans"" address coming.""

And back to housing... we have all heard the stories of struggling sinkies... making appeals to HDB, MP's... everyone under the sun and moon... just to be told that HDB needs to be fair... just to be told that these are the rules...

And in even ultra extreme cases, I've known outright foreigners (non-SC/PR) being prioritized over queer sinkies. I have a sinkie friend whose spouse is not local and they both had to leave Singapore because same-sex spouses are not applicable when applying for a DP; meanwhile foreign couples -- as long as they are straight -- don't seem to have much trouble with their DP applications.

I know what some PAP-apologists are already going to say.

""Oh, but this isn't a foreigners vs sinkie vs new-SC thing; we treat all queers the same."" I've heard this line many times.

Bruh. The process doesn't matter when the end result -- the result which I see and feel every single day -- is what it currently is: that I cannot BTO a 3/+ room flat, whereas many others who never served can.

The process also doesn't matter... when there's always a long list of excuses, justifications, reasoning (as above)... as to why my partner and I cannot BTO a 3/+ room flat despite being together for the better part of two decades.

And of course... the process most certainly doesn't fking matter... when the PAP can go out of its way to take my 4-room BTO away from me under extremely questionable circumstances.

Yes, I am that woman: https://qz.com/988514/

Oh, and don't forget who was the Minister for the Ministry of Social and Family Development when my marriage was revoked.

Yep, Tan Chuan-Jin. Yep, Mr. ""fucking populist."" Yep, Mr. extramarital affair.

What a slap across the face. Where's the sanctity of marriage now, eh?

During my ordeals, throughout my struggles... I've even had PAP-apologists call me bitter. Blaming me for my views, blaming me for my resentment. Blaming my bitterness for why the world isn't a better place (I'm not even joking here).

These are people who can tell me after I have lost my house straight in my face that the ""government does good."" Good for you, I guess?

Some other PAP-apologists have even tried to convince me that what the PAP did was for my own safety. That somehow, if marriage-quality was granted, we'd be met with more resentment from more ""traditional"" folk.

Foreigners telling me we have things great in this country and should be grateful.

New citizens telling me that the government needs to be fair.

Everyone telling me that Singapore is ""more conservative"" and this is what I get for ""choosing to be"" queer / trans / with another woman.

I've heard it all. How in the fking hell am I supposed to accept any of this crap?

Ultimately, I know what many people think. That I am pro-opposition, that I am all fk-the-gahmen.

And to that I'll say: I'll leave my strongest criticism for our opposition parties much in the same way as how I have always left my strongest criticisms towards my own race.

When my house was taken away from me, the We Are Against Pink Dot SG / Wear White groups celebrated the loss of our home and marriage on Facebook. Last I remember the *only* party with an MP in such a group is WP.

WAAPD/WW did not care that MSF/ROM likely acted beyond the scope of the law. All they cared about was that MSF/ROM's bigotry aligned with their own.

During the years when I was coping with the loss of my home, I even emailed SDP and even Dr. Chee directly. We never heard back.

We even emailed Jamus Lim. We never heard back.

But above all, do you know who I blame the most? Fellow Singaporeans and their penchant for upholding and continuing to enable the sinkie-pwn-sinkie culture.

This exact culture is the precise reason why we born-and-bred sinkies will always be low. Because those who come into our country will take away what we hold dear to our hearts while we continue to fight against each other.

Despite this however, I will always defend my brothers and sisters, and each and every sinkie in-between.

I will always defend the uncles and aunties at coffee shops who call me ah kua. I will always defend the muds/minahs who call me bapok thinking I don't know what they're saying. When it comes down to it, I will still defend my fellow sinkies no matter how low they look down on me. Because I know that if I don't... we're finished. Every single one of us.

Thanks for reading me KPKB’ing. And sorry if I don’t reply. I hate myself more than enough as it is, and I don’t think I have it in me anymore to read any of the replies. If you think you can shoot me down while I am at my lowest… trust me… I’ve both seen and heard it all. There’s no going deeper from here.",12,1746086568.0,askSingapore,5,0.61,False

This is my previous one [https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1jv8jhf/my\_personal\_diary/](https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1jv8jhf/my_personal_diary/)

**Mental side:**

Not much change since that post. I spent every free minute (sometimes even in my job OR DRIVING A CAR, god I am so screw and getting out of this self-destoying loop os being miserable will be loooon journey) on reddit or chatting with ChatGPT to make me feel better or asking about statistic and my case. After my long desrcibction he told me im  mild case which I dont really believe. I one it's false believe but reading about my state make me more peacefull, I'm kinda addicted to it/develop some OCD about it. I feel like this is permament, I feel like I will never be able to drink coffee, alcohol to dance on parties, to go cycling with people I love and like, to go for a stupid walk without pain... I cannot see how beautiful world is right now :c

**My symptoms now:**

\- neck, lower back,knees pain when I walk or after a walk when I stand. Is not even a pain more like a discomfort 2/10, I would like to know if for others this is the same (?)

\- calves discomfrot when I walk (even 500 steps). I really don't know how to describe it and if it is more related to tendons, muscles or nerves but it feels like I was running a lot the previous day, like they are fatigue/weak (?)

\- shoulders pain 2/10

\- joints cracking

\- dry mouth especially in the morining or when I wake up in the middle of a night

\- tingling in legs, hands 3/10

\- waking up with tingling, once it was whole body,other times my right hand, it lasts 5 minutes and disappears

\- cold feet and hands it doesn't bother me at all, if I will have to choose and symptom which might stay with me it would be this one :)

\- light insomnia - it's very hard to fall asleep, like I need an hour or more, then I wake up in a middle of the night and sometimes will fall asleep again sometimes not; I wake up tired but who wouldn't be after sleeping 4-6 hours per day for 2 weeks

\- weakness in my arms (especially right one, maybe I'm overusing it while doing daily tasks? Even typing on computer reminds me how weak I am...

\- I don't know if it's connected but I have strange sensation in my utheral area, not for a whole day so I suspect it's another gift from Cipro. Anyway I want to conduct some urine test just in case.

Anxiety, heart racing, numb jaw, are gone or come back for 15 min per day and doesnt bother me.

Not being hungry and slowed vision dissappered for good (well we never know :C)

**Flare ups?:**

I think I'm doing pretty well, since the symptoms poped out many of them are lighter/ less intense (or I want to think that way, my brain is super tricky, I'm not a person I used to be I feel like I cant believe myself anymore). I did 13k steps and 2 days later in a job i have this strange symptom of not understanding what people what from me, I just couldn't focus (and believe me, in my job I have many stimuli) which was like a state from beggining of my  journey. It lasted 4hours, but the same night was super hard for me to fall asleep and my heart was beating super fast (so basically firsts symptoms which were eased apper once again). Also my back pain was more like a lightly burning that day. I hate the fact it can happen and will don't know when and if I can rely on my body, how long it will last etc.

**Some positive things:**

\- nothing new pop out since 1,5 week, discomfort I have is only changing place (sometimes right knee hurts sometimes left one, but I would say that my right side is more prone to be weak)

\- thank god no rupture, eye-floaters, tintinnus - may god save me from this pleeease

\- I'm still able to walk 8k steps feels (doing with calves and back discomfort). I'm glad because I work as an construction enginner and I would never want to give up this job.

Supplements/diet:

\- magensium, ALA, B12, B1, Vit c, Vit D3, Omega-3, folate when I remember, ashwaganda, melatonine, collagen, Q10, probiotics, selenium.  I took glutathione 2 times but I felt like it flared me (I woke up 5 hours after taking it with headache and could fall back to sleep). Maybe and NAC I hope it's not too late?

\- I'm eating 90% anti-inflamatory mostly only fruits, veggies, meat and grains. Altough I had a cake and nothing bad happend

**Personal events:**

\- broke up with my boyfiend after 3,5 years of being together. I was planning to do this anyway and to be honest I am so fixated about my stated that I barely see his absence. I feel like I shoud  have than that earlier because we didn't get along from looong time.

\- I visited dr Pietruszynski (I'm from Poland) for some hope but he didn't gave me it. Asked for statistics of recovery and he told me he have a one patient who is totally out of it and then started to talking about other who end-up on wheelchair. Great. Told me also that in my case it will be 1-2 years (looong) I don't even know why he told me that because he didn't even allowed me to speak about my symptoms. He printed me his article and mention a magensium (AT THE END OF APPOINTMENT) and asked if I took it right away - I said noafter 10 days. And he said ""it's not good"" - thanks man. So it was a disaster, but anyway I have a strage and strong urge to go to him once again I don't know why. Maybe just to talk even more about it. I am screw mentally.

\- still looking for a magic bullet. But it doesnt existst

\- I don't have anyone except one colleauge who is SUPPER SUPPORTIVE. Thank you, one person who listens to you and with who you can make different than physical activities can change so much.

**Plans for the future:**

\- I thought about having coffee for my 1-month floxieversarry but I read that for people with neuropathy it may cause flare up (indeed my last one coffee was 2,5 week ago and after 1,5 day I experience tingling in my legs for a whole day- terrible but never came back in such a intensity) so I will postpone trying coffe for a 3-month mark

\- I would like to try swimming (MISS SO MUCH SWIMMING AND RUNNING) at 2 mont mark (can wait to it) of course I will see have I will feel. Funny, I was always looking for those slowly swimming people with superiority. And know will be one of them -lesson learned, never judged anyone because they have their own battle.

\- in 2 weeks I'm going on buisness trip including wine testing and kayaking and it will be super hard for me to abstane from alcohol. Or maybe to tell to people, that I JUST CAN'T DRINK. I was never a beer-bro drinking after job or to relax so problem is more about talk to people not to convince me to drink rather to abstane from it. I used to love dancing at parties and drink a lot of vodka, people associate me with vodka literally. Miss my old self really but she is dead. Super hard to see all of those people not knowing WTF is happening inside my brain and have to pretend like it's ok :C

\- **STOP reading reddit**, letting my body heal, just... I think I've read recovery megapost at least 3 times. I was Sherlock Holmes and was checking peoples profiles to see how they are doing after stating they recovered and you know what? Most of them have a relapse or flare which doesn't make me feel any better. I feel like when I will be able to lessen reading I will stop focusing on symptoms, just let it be, and live again, different live but.. well. It happend and I/we have to get over it. It so hard to see the progress because it is so slow, so I think I will never be able to get over it and live :C

\- probably I will ask my family if I can spent weekends with them. Just to put my phone away and talk with them. I just have to have anyone near me. I'm not having suicidal thought but time just slowed down. It's so hard.

Two characters, no love drama, absolute loyalty ,they finish each other's sentences, laugh at each other at the most inopportune moments, and come hard when it matters most. That's where the sparks fly.



Think of Ailin and Marisol in The Fire This Time ; shoplifting, reading midnight poetry, plotting revolutions, not broken hearts. Or Kit and Maeve in The Summer of Salt ; bonding over witches' familiars and old family hexes, showing us a soul-sister relationship can be infinitely greater than star crossed lovers.



Sincerely? Platonic mythic crew or found family group any day, hands down, over angsty love triangle. Bonus points if they're sneaking through the demon-killing snack food aisle, getting heist-night disguises on, or saving each other in the middle of the chaos because, of course, they know your coffee order.



So let's be real:  Which book (or TV!) non-romantic couple fist-bumped you and your bestie? → Which ride-or-die sidekicks stole the scene?  And hot take , do these friendships actually feel more legendary because there's no romance complicating the mix?

Having heard about taste profiles of flat burrs, i was curious. Reading reviews i found anything below 300€ was more or less unusable. I didn't want to go for start ups or chinese companies, fearing two or three years down the line i wouldn't be able to get support or spare parts. So the used market it was. Browsing around i found i could get a Baratza/Mahlkönig Vario from 2015 for ~100€. Reading up on it, it has alot of Potential for tune ups (alicorn alignment) and spare parts were still readily available and cheap. Seller said, that the burrs were worn and it couldn't grind espresso as good as it used to.

Upon receiving it, i did a test grind on the finest setting and saw, that indeed, it was alot coarser than i expected. It also made a very uneven sound while grinding. Reading on Mahlkönig website, the ceramic burrs should be good for 2000kg of coffee. I reconed it must be something else. So i tore the whole machine down. I was suprised, how much ground and also whole beens where inside the back (where the angry electrons and spinny bits live). Also there was a lot of carbon deposit from the motor brushes. I cleaned everything and found my first culprit. The belt has lost some teeth in one place. I bought the replacement belt+pulley kit for 15€. Swapped both, added new grease and it was running smooth again. Regarding the grind size, it seemed the calibration screw had backed out. I removed it and screwed it back in with some yarn wrapped around the threads. I did the alicorn alignment procedure and where back to a suprisingly silent flat burr grinder for 115€.

🎶and so it goes
and you're the only one who knows🎵

music is ruined too because of him

why can't i focus?

am i as erratic as him,
when he was manic,
 blasting soft rock through the house?

i wanna stop before i turn into him,
it's what I dread

when you know what's coming and you know the solution 

why can't I be happy?

i shouldn't be selfish,
i'm the youngest so why was I the parent?

why am i still the parent

no matter how far i go, where i move
i can't get out of that fucking house.

and now

a wonderful partner who needs mothering, and i do it gladly
with my fingers crossed behind my back,

because why do I have to be the one keeping track of 

two sets of appointments

two dinners

two sets of dishes

two showers—don't forget to brush your teeth
I'll skip mine and put off the dentist.

I hope this infection takes me out.

even though i have a building resent my partner is wonderful

and strong and hard working

a beautiful soul

i'd do him a favor by cutting the cord.

why can't I?

what a coward trying to spare myself the guilt of one honest action.

 I'm setting up breakfast

looking into my void of coffee

seeing my parents

and 26 years worth of bags under my eyes

he loves my eyes

says they're rich and lively

but when i look into them i just see a pit

the kind i'd rather be in. 

no pills

no words

just nothingness

for whatever brief second of bliss

before i have to wake up and do it all over again

reincarnation scares me the most.

naturally it's the only afterlife theory i cling on to

1kc37m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeR/comments/1kc37m0/pap_the_ultimate_capitalist_in_singapore/,PAP - The Ultimate Capitalist in Singapore,"As you all know, the PAP recently increased the GST from 7% to 9%. However, that’s not the only way the PAP profits from ordinary Singaporeans. You would have noticed that the prices of all goods and services have increased over the years, far beyond 2%. Because rental costs for these businesses have been rising steadily. And the PAP government has consistently earned a huge profit by having a monopoly on Singapore's most precious resource: Land.

In 1966, the Land Acquisition Act was introduced, which allows the Singapore government to forcibly acquire private land at below-market prices. The government currently owns approximately 90% of all the land, giving it a de facto monopoly. 

The government, through the SLA, then sells land leases, usually between 30 to 99 years. This makes the land in Singapore a renewable resource for the Singapore Government. After the leases expire, the land will be automatically returned to the government to be sold again. Therefore, one could argue that land in a tiny city state like Singapore is an extremely valuable asset, possibly even more valuable than natural resources like gold or oil. 

Private developers such as REITs would buy these land leases and develop the land by building shopping malls, condominiums, offices, factories and more. They will then generate profits by renting out these properties to be used by the businesses that provide you with goods and services. So whenever you buy something or pay for a service, you are indirectly paying for the cost of land leases sold by the Singapore government. And because land prices have been increasing over the years, the cost of rental has also increased which causes the price of your goods and services to increase as well. 

The government has substantial ownership in many of these REITs through their sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings (I.e Mapletree, Capitaland). So the government is basically double dipping, profiting not only from the sale of land leases, but also from the dividends of the REITs! To top it all off, GST is then levied on all the goods and services provided. 

The profiting comes from residential and public housing as well. When you buy a BTO flat from HDB, you are paying for both the construction cost and land cost. HDB buys land leases from SLA at what they consider a “Fair Market Value”. Of course, as land prices have been increasing over the years, this “Fair Market Value” has increased as well. Remember, the government acquired this land a long time ago for a rock bottom price. And now they sell it to us for a profit at what they consider Market Value. This is one of the reasons why property prices have been skyrocketing 

In short, everything that you do is on land leased from the government which profit off you not just once, but at multiple levels.

And that’s not all. The PAP also has a direct or indirect stake in many essential sectors: utilities (SP Group), telecommunications (Singtel), airlines (SIA), offshore and marine businesses (Keppel, Seatrium), and more, largely through Temasek Holdings. Through its political ties with NTUC, it also has influence over key supermarket (NTUC FairPrice) and insurance (Income Insurance) players. Unlike most capitalist countries, which mainly rely on taxes for revenue, Singapore has built a system where the state profits through widespread land ownership and Government-Linked Companies.

Despite being in a much better fiscal position than before the COVID-19 pandemic, the PAP still has the gall to increase the GST from 7% to 9% during a period of heightened inflation and rising cost of living. They claim that they need the money in order to save up for a “rainy day” in the future. But they seem to have forgotten about the “today”. What about the elderly poor who have to pick up cardboard just to make a living, or dishwashing and cleaning the hawker centers and coffee shops. 

Looking at how the PAP runs Singapore, it seems as though they are not running a country but a monopolistic corporation where the aim appears to be market dominance: driving out competition, consolidating control, and ultimately raising the cost of the product. Instead of the Republic of Singapore, we have become Singapore Inc. A profit driven, monopolistic conglomerate where the senior executives draw an exorbitant salary while ordinary workers bear the burden of stagnant wages, rising costs and systemic inequality.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not against the Land Acquisition Act or building up a strong national reserve to protect ourselves during crises. What I take issue with is the hoarding of these fiscal resources under the guise of prudence with much of the wealth distributed amongst the ministers, senior civil servants and those connected with the establishment. 

Elections are just around the corner. Please don’t be fooled by the PAP’s election carrots, their fear mongering of Singapore collapsing if the opposition is voted in or their constant nostalgic reminders of the achievements of the 1st generation PAP.

Elisa Muse  
  
The ringing in my ears is so annoying that I have no choice but to wake up. I check the time, ""Who the f\*\*k calls me at three in the morning?"" I grumpily complain, then I stare at the screen and sigh,  
  
""Of course, she will be the one calling..."" I sighed, and after missing the first call, I got on the first ring, the second.  
  
""Hi, Grandma..."" I said in a sleepy but cheerful voice. My grandmother is the bomb.   
  
""Oh, Elisa... I hope I am not interrupting you in your chores, darling..."" she said, and I scrunched my eyebrows. No matter how long I have lived abroad, she never gets the time difference right.  
  
I yawned, ""No, Grams, I was sleeping. It is three in the morning..."" I said,   
  
""What are you doing at that hour?"" she asked, appalled. ""You are young, yes, but you still need your beauty sleep,"" she advised, making me laugh.   
  
Is she for real? She was the one who woke me up with her call... I took a deep breath and closed my eyes,   
  
""Well, lucky for you, I am up... so what's new, Grams?"" I asked,   
  
""Oh, honey... I was calling you about something... but I don't remember what it was... I am sure it will come to me..."" she said, and my heart squeezed. My grandmother is entirely functional, but her mind slips sometimes... I love her to pieces, but with her almost ninety years of age, the possibility of not having her around increases every day. That is why I don't complain whenever she calls me at odd hours.   
  
""So, tell me... How have you been?"" she asked,   
  
""I am doing great, Grams. The fashion house I work for is planning a huge runway, and guess whose designs made the cut?"" I said in a sing-song voice.   
  
""You are very talented. I am sure you got that from me. And your beauty comes from this side of the family..."" she said matter-of-factly, despite me being a carbon copy of my mother.   
  
""Oh! I remembered..."" she said triumphantly, and I waited for her to say whatever she needed.   
  
""What is it, Grams?"" I asked her after the long pause she held.   
  
""Eddie is coming home for Christmas..."" She announced proudly, and I almost gasped. Eddie, my brother, is a very famous music producer. He tours the globe most of the year with his band, the Abbotts Red. He hasn't been home for a while, and I managed to see him briefly two years ago when he made a quick pit-stop in Paris...   
  
""Wow, Grams, that is nice... He finally made time to pause and return to the mothership..."" I joked, and she giggled.   
  
""So, here is the plan..."" she said, not giving room for any arguments. ""Everyone, and I mean that... will be home for the Holidays... I want all my grandkids, kids, and everyone here with me..."" She paused, and I froze.   
  
I haven't been back home either. It has been five years since my heart got broken, stomped about, chewed, and spat back. I had been avoiding the moment I had to return, and I was about to yell at her that I wouldn't return home or celebrate the Holidays. I stopped celebrating five years ago and see no reason to start now. ""Elisa, I am getting old and want one last memory of my family. I am starting to forget things, and I can see it in your dad's face... he is worried about me... Buddy, too..."" she sighed,   
  
""Would you? Please? For me?"" she pleaded, and with a tear escaping my eyes, I took a deep breath and barfed,   
  
""Of course, Grams, I will be there for the Holidays..."" My voice choked. This was hard for me to do, but she was right. Who knows if this could be her last Christmas, if not physically, mentally, with us? She wants to treasure one more holiday in her heart because her mind is starting to fail.   
  
""Excellent... I knew you would say yes..."" She sighed, and then she paused.   
  
""Hello?"" she said,   
  
""Grams?"" I muttered,   
  
""Oh, darling... it is nice that you have called..."" she sighed, and I choked... Yes, my Grams were slipping into oblivion more frequently, even if I didn't celebrate Holidays and swore never to return to that place... I will do it for her... for the memories we will create and treasure forever.   
  
""I love you, Grams..."" I sighed, and she chuckled.   
  
""Don't tell the others... but you are my favorite..."" she mumbled, making me laugh. I was sure she told that to everyone... and I mean it... I heard her say the same thing to Eddie once, and there is no doubt she has said it to Amanda or Peyton.   
  
""I've got to go, Grams. Say hi to Buddy. I love you both!"" I sighed, and she said goodbye, finishing the call.   
  
""Putain, qui t'appelle à cette heure?"" (f\*\*\*\*\*g hell, who calls you at this hour?) Collette, my best friend and roommate, stood at the threshold of my room. She worked for the same fashion house, and we were each other's rides or dies.  
  
""My grandmother..."" I replied, and she sighed.   
  
""Honey..."" she sat beside me, realizing I had tears in my eyes. ""Is it that bad?"" she asked, and I nodded.   
  
""Worse, she was slipping away and asked me to return home for Christmas..."" I sighed, and she patted my head, running her fingers in my messy locks.   
  
""I think it is time for you to go... five years... you are not the same, and I am sure things have changed..."" she sighed, and I nodded.   
  
""Maybe... but I don't celebrate anything anymore... but I will pretend for Grams' sake,"" I added.   
  
""It looks like you will need reinforcements..."" she sighed, and I nodded with a pout.   
  
""Will you?"" I asked, and she chuckled.   
  
""Are there any hot guys in your little American town? You know I am out of luck with Parisian guys... I am too much for them..."" She said confidently, and I shrugged my shoulders.   
  
""A couple of jerks, maybe..."" I sighed,   
  
""Those are enough to get a good laid..."" she said enthusiastically. Collette's standards were way below average. Every time we went out, it ended the same way: I came back alone because she had hooked up with some random dude... I wished she could see how amazing and worthy she was. She deserved the world, but she had permanently settled for peanuts.  
  
On the other hand, I knew my worth and was traded for peanuts. After that, I never bounced back, never recovered fully, and I knew that the pestering wound would come out bursting as soon as I stepped home. I needed Collette there; she was the only one who could contain the outburst.   
  
""Scoot over, let's catch some sleep, and we will talk about it tomorrow..."" She made a spot on my bed for herself, and having her around made me feel secure and comfortable. Despite that, sleep never came back. My mind reeled about what had happened five years ago, and my stomach churned with the idea of seeing him again.   
  
I never spoke to him. I left and never turned around. Could it be that he will realize what he has lost when he sees it? Is my heart ready to see him? Would he be as handsome as ever? What would I say? What would he say? Suddenly, the promise I made to Grandma seemed like a terrible idea...   
  
Would I ever be ready to go back to our town? The most festive city during the Holidays? The townspeople call it 'Mistletoe Town' as a joke. I had no idea if I was ready, but I would return home for her: My Grams.  
  


# Chapter 2 - Two Options

Elisa Muse  
  
Colette and I woke up early the following day. We had a plane to catch, a long flight to endure, and a family to face... at least, I have to.   
  
We cleared security and headed to the nearest airport coffee shop to fuel the day. I was not a morning person and a nasty woman without coffee, which is essential to taming the beast.   
  
""Are you ready?"" Colette said, and I nodded.   
  
""Thanks for coming along. I am sure it will be a wild ride,"" I said, and she nodded.   
  
""Anything for you, ma biche..."" She giggled, and I rolled my eyes.   
  
""But I was not asking you about taking the plane and leaving Paris. I was asking about being there and the odd possibility of running into the man..."" she said, and my stomach churned.   
  
Five years ago, my entire life changed...   
  
FLASHBACK   
  
""I can't believe it is only a week away!"" I said to my mother, and she smiled.   
  
""Yes, you and Noah have been together since you were in diapers... this is a dream come true..."" Mom said while fixing the veil on my head. I was on my last dress fitting before the wedding. The most minor tweaks that must be done for it to be perfect.   
  
It was a dream come true for both of our families. I still remember how elated my mother was when Noah and I broke the news about us being officially boyfriend and girlfriend four years ago. Noel and I were high school sweethearts; we were official by the end of our 9th year, and against all odds, we were together through high school... naturally, we wanted to leave for college as husband and wife. My parents were best friends with his parents, and in a way, we were fulfilling the family's dream.   
  
""Mom, did you get wedding jitters'"" I asked her, and she smiled.   
  
""Sweetie, yes... I almost didn't marry your father..."" She smiled and cupped my cheek tenderly. The glow in her eyes said it all... she loved my father even more than the first day, and she hoped the dream would become a reality for me. She and Sammy, Noah's mom, always said that we were meant to be together.   
  
""Why would you ask that?"" Mom bit her lower lip, and fear crossed her eyes.   
  
""I don´t know. Noah was my first boyfriend, a kiss and everything, and now marrying him will mean he will be my first forever."" I paused, feeling a big knot settle in my stomach.   
  
""Are you having trouble with him?"" Mom asked. ""Because I can talk to Sammy and ask her to straighten him out,"" Mom said in her heavy, nonsense tone.   
  
""Oh No! Mother! It was just a question,"" I quickly said, and she nodded.   
  
Deep down, the knot in the pit of my stomach, the nerves, the wedding jitters, but the lack of spark in Noah's eyes when he spotted me told a completely different story. I was happy, Noah as a catch, and I was too... it was a match made in heaven, the perfect couple, the perfect family, and the perfect future... but nothing is perfect... I am going to blame everything on these damn nerves and brush it off; after all, a week from now, I am going to be away on my honeymoon in Paris. Paris! I can't wait!   
  
Mom and I made our way back home. We kept these appointments secret to surprise Grams with the beautiful gown we had made for the special day. I was barely nineteen, and Noah was a year older. However, due to a severe case of dyslexia when he was younger, he was pushed a year behind in school. I was with him through all of it as a friend—we have always been friends—and I trust him with my life.   
  
Grams sulked when we arrived because we hadn't included her in the last dress fitting. As I headed to my bedroom, Mom took care of her, and I found a small note under my door. Eddie's friend Noel also often left notes or stickers at my door. Despite being boyfriend and girlfriend and soon to be married, we had established clear boundaries regarding space and privacy so he would never dream of entering my room when I wasn't there.   
  
I picked up the note and unfolded it...   
  
""POOL HOUSE u/7,   
  
N""   
  
I giggled. Noel had been most anxious about our honeymoon, and even when we promised to consummate our love once we were married, I was not immune to his charms and a good make-out session.   
  
If I must be honest, I couldn't wait either... Maybe we can eat the cake before the wedding tonight. After all, what is a week in the grand scheme of things? My heart fluttered, and my hands felt clammy.   
  
I checked the time, and it was close to seven. I changed my outfit into something more cute and my underwear into a sexy, lacey one. If I allow Noel to pop my cherry tonight, I want to do it in style.   
  
I sneaked out of my home. If my family saw me walking out, they would ask endless questions. These are questions I was not in the mood to answer. I silently made my way to the pool house.   
  
The pool house was an apartment my parents first had as a storage place. When Eddie chose to study music, they remodeled it and converted it into a two-bedroom apartment with a music studio. That way, if Eddie had a spur of inspiration, he would have a place to crash.   
  
Everyone knew the pool house as Eddie's man cave, which went unused while he was studying in New York. So, naturally, while he was out, it was our official make-out place...   
  
I walked closer and heard some noise inside. My stomach quickly flipped, knowing Noel was waiting for me. I took a deep breath and silently opened the door. I was ready to be his, even though we were not married.   
  
My entire body wanted this, my heart belonged to him, it was natural that my body would too...   
  
With silent steps, I made my way to the upstairs bedrooms... Then I saw the light coming from one of the doors. He must be waiting for me there. The door was slightly open, and when I was about to push it to walk in, I heard,   
  
""Oh, God... Noah..."" a female voice moaned.   
  
Instead of opening the door, I peered through the door crack, and naked on the bed, was Noah pumping hard into Adrianna Carter... Of all the people he chose to cheat on me, it had to be her. The woman who hated my guts, my nemesis...   
  
""f\*\*k, Adri... you feel so good..."" he grunted while the slapping noises increased in intensity.   
  
The same intensity that shattered my heart, the same slapping I would feel... Tears welled in my eyes and fell even against my will...   
  
I saw enough, and I was about to retire silently and confront him once I was on a better estate, but the sob I was painfully holding in escaped... aldo against my will... He stopped and turned around to see my retrieved figure...   
  
""Ellie..."" He screamed while I ran like the devil and locked myself in my bedroom.   
  
Moments later, I heard a knock on my door, ""Ellie..."" his voice boomed on the other side...   
  
""It is over..."" I mumbled between tears...   
  
I heard a gasp, and I knew the entire audience was there... I was sure they saw me running inside and then Noah following me... My family loved to be in everyone's business, and this was no exception.  
  
I took a deep breath and opened the door. Turning to stare at my parents, I said, ""I am leaving tomorrow. "" With that, I locked myself in my room again. This town holds too many memories and too much pain. The entire dream had been crushed and stomped upon, and I was sure I would never be able to love again, unlike I had always loved Noah.   
  
The following morning, I packed a bag, went to the airport, purchased a ticket to Paris, and left, hoping never to return. However, I was heading back.   
  
END OF FLASHBACK  
  
""You spaced out,"" Colette said, and I gave her a tight smile. Our plane took off while I was going down horror memory lane.   
  
""I'm sorry. Some unpleasant memories crawled into my head,"" I said, shaking my head. She held my hand.   
  
""We have two options..."" She wiggled her eyebrows... ""Either we get pissed out drunk, or we sleep without drinking..."" She giggled...   
  
""Pissed out drunk..."" I said, and she clapped. Of course, anything to drown the pain and tuck it back into the corner where it was locked away.",1,1746085425.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Lately, there’s a growing trend of users generating the same AI image over and over—sometimes 100 times or more—just to prove that a model can’t recreate the exact same image twice. Yes, we get it: AI image generation involves randomness, and results will vary. But this kind of repetitive prompting isn’t a clever insight anymore—it’s just a trend that’s quietly racking up a massive environmental cost.

Each image generation uses roughly 0.010 kWh of electricity. Running a prompt 100 times burns through about 1 kWh—that’s enough to power a fridge for a full day or brew 20 cups of coffee.

## What is GPT 5.0 Lispro?

GPT 5.0 Lispro is an **AI-driven trading platform** designed to help users make more informed and faster financial trades. It uses advanced natural language processing and machine learning models, supposedly based on the GPT-5 architecture, to scan market data, predict price trends, and execute trades automatically or semi-automatically.

Think of it as your personal AI trading assistant. Unlike traditional platforms that require manual analysis and decision-making, GPT 5.0 Lispro does the heavy lifting by offering **real-time insights**, auto-trade options, and custom alerts.

The platform aims to bridge the gap between beginners and the complex world of crypto and forex trading, essentially lowering the barrier to entry for anyone interested in dabbling with digital assets.

## Who Created GPT 5.0 Lispro?

The creators of GPT 5.0 Lispro are somewhat under the radar, which can be a little frustrating if you like knowing exactly who’s behind the scenes. From what I’ve found, it appears to be developed by a group of fintech developers and AI researchers, possibly linked to teams that have worked on similar platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge.

There’s no Elon Musk or Sam Altman tied to it (despite the ""GPT"" branding), so don’t get it confused with OpenAI. But the tech it uses does seem to be inspired by large language models, maybe even fine-tuned versions tailored for financial forecasting.

This isn’t unusual in the automated trading world—many platforms are created by anonymous or semi-anonymous teams to avoid regulatory headaches. That said, the platform does follow **compliance protocols like KYC (Know Your Customer)** and privacy regulations in most countries where it operates.

### [🔥 Start Trading with GPT 5.0 Lispro Today](https://is.gd/eLBXMe)
## How Does GPT 5.0 Lispro Work?

GPT 5.0 Lispro works by combining **AI algorithms with real-time market data** to optimize trading decisions. Once you’re signed up and funded, the platform allows you to either manually control trades or let the AI bot handle them for you.

Here’s how it breaks down:

- The GPT-based engine pulls data from multiple exchanges and news sources.
- It processes this data using machine learning models to predict short-term market trends.
- You can set your risk level and preferences, and the bot executes trades accordingly.
- The platform also includes dashboards with customizable alerts and performance tracking.

It’s basically like hiring a data analyst who never sleeps and reacts in milliseconds. While it’s not magic (you can still lose money), it does give you an edge, particularly if you’re not glued to charts 24/7.

## GPT 5.0 Lispro Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real—no platform is perfect. Here’s my take on the good and the not-so-good with GPT 5.0 Lispro:

**Pros:**

- **Beginner-friendly UI** with easy onboarding
- **AI-powered analysis** reduces guesswork
- **Customizable trading settings** for different risk appetites
- **Multiple asset support** including crypto, forex, and stocks
- **Responsive customer support** that actually answers emails

**Cons:**

- **No downloadable app** (browser-only can be limiting)
- **Limited transparency** about the development team
- **Risk of loss** like with any trading platform
- **Requires a $250 deposit** to get started

If you’ve tried other bots, you’ll likely find this one more polished and slightly smarter. But it’s still not a “set it and forget it” solution—you’ll want to check in regularly.

### [👉 Open Your GPT 5.0 Lispro Account Now](https://is.gd/eLBXMe)

## GPT 5.0 Lispro – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where GPT 5.0 Lispro shines. The platform uses **GPT-style natural language processing** to scan articles, social media, and financial reports to catch market shifts as they happen.

It doesn’t just spit out numbers—it gives context. You’ll see sentiment analysis, trend summaries, and even potential trade recommendations, all in real time.

### User-Friendly Interface

This is ideal for spreading your risk or trying new markets without switching platforms.

## Is GPT 5.0 Lispro a Scam?

No, GPT 5.0 Lispro doesn’t come off as a scam. It has legitimate features, SSL encryption, KYC compliance, and a working withdrawal system.

That said, don’t expect miracles. The AI helps, but it’s not foolproof. You should still do your homework and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Always start with the **demo account** to test the waters.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on GPT 5.0 Lispro?

The **minimum deposit is $250**. This is pretty standard for platforms in this category.

You can deposit using:

Once funded, you can switch between demo and live trading modes.

- I was unsure about בישול [Pealim](https://www.pealim.com/search/?from-nav=1&q=בישול) said it meant ""cooking/boiling"" but is ""brewing"" an option here too? And the word had ב- as a prefix, so doesn't the verb בבישול mean ""in cooking/boiling""?
- in the sentence להינות מניחוח ארומטי מופלא, ולהמתין כשתי דקות, the part which says מניחוח ארומטי מופלא would mean ""wonderfully aromatic scent""?
- the word לשמירת would mean ""for safekeeping""? Because the prefix ל- would mean ""for"" and שמירת is a verb which would mean ""guarding/preserving""?
- the suffix -נו indicates possession, therefore מפעל + נו means ""our factory""?

## What is Profit WiFi System?

Profit WiFi System is an **automated trading software** designed to help users trade various financial assets like **cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks**. Think of it like a digital assistant that uses algorithms to analyze markets and execute trades on your behalf. You just set your preferences, and the system does the rest.

It’s marketed as a way for people with **little to no trading experience** to still participate in the markets and potentially profit from them. Whether you’re into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or traditional assets, this platform offers a range of tools to help you trade smarter, not harder.

## Who Created Profit WiFi System?

The Profit WiFi System doesn’t have a big flashy name behind it like Elon Musk or Brian Armstrong (hey, that’s me 😉), but that’s pretty common in the world of automated trading platforms. 

From my research, it seems like a group of **fintech developers and market analysts** were behind the creation of the system. Their goal? To make high-level trading strategies accessible to the average person. It shares some similarities with platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**, which also operate in the automated trading space.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Profit WiFi System Today](https://is.gd/OBCSev)
## How Does Profit WiFi System Work?

The Profit WiFi System works by using **smart algorithms and AI** to scan the market for profitable trading opportunities. Once it spots a potential trade that fits the parameters you’ve set (or its default settings), it executes the trade for you—automatically.

Here’s the basic flow:
- The system uses **real-time market data** and historical trends.
- It identifies patterns or signals that typically result in profitable trades.
- When it sees a match, it **places a buy or sell order** through your connected broker.
- You can let it run on auto-pilot or manually tweak settings if you want more control.

It’s essentially the **autopilot mode for trading**, which is especially helpful if you’re not glued to your screen 24/7.

## Profit WiFi System Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real—no platform is perfect. Here’s what I found after testing and digging into user experiences:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Super beginner-friendly

# Why the Excitement?? Why Should I Get Involved?

Understanding the human condition couldn't be a bigger breakthrough! This explanation of Jeremy Griffith's work taken from [FAQ 1.6: 'Why this solves Everything'](https://www.humancondition.com/wtm-faq-why-does-understanding-solve-everything/) describes the immense significance of getting to the core issue in all human affairs:

>**All the problems we’re experiencing on this planet, aside from natural phenomenon, are caused by us humans. We are the ones who are egocentric, selfish, greedy, materialistic, fake, angry as hell. And so it’s that underlying issue — our destructively behaved, so-called human condition — that really has to be addressed and fixed if we are to solve the world’s problems.**

>**Only the psychosis-addressing-and-solving, real explanation of the human condition can stop the destruction of our world and the disintegration of society that is happening everywhere we look. And it is precisely this real psychologically redeeming, relieving and transforming explanation that biologist Jeremy Griffith has delivered in his first principle-based biological understanding of the human condition.**

And as the former president of the Canadian Psychiatric Association, [Professor Harry Prosen](https://www.harryprosen.com/), has said:

>**“I have no doubt** ***FREEDOM*** \[Jeremy Griffith's magnum opus\] **provides the holy grail of insight we have sought for the psychological rehabilitation of the human race.”**

So it's a MASSIVE and INCREDIBLY EXCITING paradigm shift that humanity has arrived at. Fellowship, engagement, and open discussion couldn't be more important at this stage in the human journey.

## What is Instant Cormax 11X?

Instant Cormax 11X is an **AI-powered automated trading platform** designed to simplify and optimize the trading experience for beginners and seasoned traders alike. It's not just for crypto—it also supports forex, stocks, and commodities.

The core idea is this: you deposit funds, customize a few settings (or just go with the suggested ones), and the algorithm takes over—scanning markets, analyzing trends, and placing trades for you. Think of it as your own personal trading assistant that doesn’t sleep or take coffee breaks.

It positions itself as a tool for people who want to **benefit from market movements** without actively managing trades every second of the day. So if you're busy working your 9-5 or just don’t wanna stare at charts all day—this might be your jam.

## Who Created Instant Cormax 11X?

The platform doesn’t put a single name behind the curtain (which is kinda common in this industry). However, it’s supposedly developed by a **team of fintech experts and former Wall Street analysts**, who wanted to democratize access to high-level trading tools.

This is similar to how platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge** operate—no flashy founder name, but a focus on the tech and team behind it. While some may find this lack of transparency a red flag, it’s not unusual for platforms in this category.

What’s more important is that they seem to partner with **regulated brokers**, which is a good sign. It adds a layer of legitimacy, especially when handling user funds.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Instant Cormax 11X Today](https://is.gd/xXlZu0)
## How Does Instant Cormax 11X Work?

At its core, Instant Cormax 11X uses **algorithmic trading**. That means it leverages real-time market data, technical indicators, and pattern recognition software to decide when to buy or sell assets.

Here’s how it plays out:

- You sign up, fund your account (minimum $250), and choose your settings.
- The algorithm starts scanning markets across multiple assets (crypto, forex, etc.).
- It identifies opportunities where profits might be made—based on historical trends, price action, and volume indicators.
- Trades are executed automatically by the system in milliseconds.

You can either let it run fully automated or switch to **manual mode** if you want more control. Either way, it’s designed to be fast, efficient, and *mostly* hands-off.

## Instant Cormax 11X Pros and Cons

## Instant Cormax 11X – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform constantly scans global markets to find the **most profitable trading opportunities**. It uses AI algorithms that adapt in real-time, meaning it doesn’t rely on outdated data to make decisions.

This helps reduce delay (aka ""slippage"") and boosts the chances of executing trades at optimal prices.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean, straightforward, and not overloaded with jargon. You get a clear view of your **portfolio, open trades, and performance metrics**.

Even if you've never traded before, you'll get the hang of it quickly. It’s like the Netflix of trading platforms—designed for easy binge-use.

It’s partnered with **regulated brokers**, has **clear terms**, and offers a **demo mode**—which are all green flags. I also tested withdrawals and didn’t run into any red tape or delays.

That said, always remember: **trading involves risk**, and no platform can guarantee profits. If you see any site promising that you’ll ""earn $1000/day guaranteed,"" run the other direction.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Instant Cormax 11X?

The platform requires a **$250 minimum deposit** to get started. This is pretty standard across similar trading tools like Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge.

The funds go straight to your broker account and are used for actual trading—not a fee. You can withdraw your capital anytime.

### Instant Cormax 11X Customer Support

Support is available **24/7**, and you can reach them via:

- 💬 Live Chat

They’re surprisingly responsive. I tested a few queries and got replies within 5 minutes on live chat and under 2 hours via email.

## How to Delete an Instant Cormax 11X Account?

If you decide to walk away, just:

2. Request account deletion
3. Make sure to withdraw all your funds first

It usually takes 24–48 hours for full deletion.

Based on patterns I’ve seen with similar apps—like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge—it’s likely built by a team of software engineers and financial analysts who specialize in algorithmic trading.

That said, the app does seem to be backed by **licensed brokers** in regions where it operates, which gives it a layer of legitimacy. It’s not just some anonymous shell running trades with no oversight.

## How Does Pondmatex App Work?

Pondmatex works by using **AI and machine learning algorithms** to scan financial markets for profitable trades. Once it finds a potential opportunity, the app either makes a trade automatically (if you’ve enabled auto-trading) or sends you an alert to approve.

In simple terms:
- You sign up and make a minimum deposit.
- You set your trading preferences (risk level, asset types, etc.).
- The app analyzes the market and executes trades for you.
- You monitor your account and withdraw profits whenever you want.

The automation is what makes this appealing. Whether you're a total newbie or a casual trader, Pondmatex reduces the need for manual analysis.

## Pondmatex App Pros and Cons

Here’s what I’ve found after some hands-on experience:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Super easy to use, even for beginners
- ✅ Supports multiple asset classes, not just crypto
- ✅ No platform fees or subscription costs
- ✅ Offers a demo mode for practice
- ✅ Fast withdrawals (usually within 24–48 hours)

**Cons:**
- ❌ No mobile app yet (browser only)
- ❌ Limited transparency on the team behind it
- ❌ You still need to monitor it occasionally—this isn’t a “set it and forget it” thing
- ❌ Not available in all countries

Honestly, the pros outweigh the cons if you’re looking for a simple way to get into trading without needing a finance degree.

1kc2xmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteNerds/comments/1kc2xmx/the_rise_of_flexible_packaging_products/,"The Rise of Flexible Packaging Products: Innovation, Efficiency, and Sustainability","In an era defined by fast-moving consumer trends, evolving retail landscapes, and growing environmental concerns, **flexible packaging products** have taken center stage as a modern solution to meet these changing demands. From food and beverages to pharmaceuticals and household items, flexible packaging has transformed the way products are preserved, transported, and presented to consumers. Unlike rigid packaging, flexible alternatives offer lightweight, adaptable, and cost-effective solutions that support both branding and functionality. These packaging products, which include pouches, wraps, sachets, bags, and films, are rapidly replacing traditional formats across many sectors due to their remarkable versatility and value proposition.

One of the main reasons for the growing popularity of [**flexible packaging products**](https://bowepack.com/products/) is their efficiency in terms of material usage and logistics. Flexible packaging requires less raw material to produce than rigid containers such as glass or hard plastic, resulting in reduced manufacturing and transportation costs. These lightweight materials make it easier to store and transport products, thereby lowering fuel consumption and carbon emissions throughout the supply chain. This combination of economic and environmental benefits makes flexible packaging an appealing choice for both businesses and consumers. Furthermore, their compact and conforming design allows for better shelf utilization in retail settings, offering more visibility and convenience.

https://preview.redd.it/7q1bziudg4ye1.jpg?width=513&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4ca21b8e0c36bfbf79ef23f86d8ad9ca479b66f

Flexible packaging products also offer an exceptional level of protection and customization. Advanced barrier technologies used in films and laminates help preserve freshness, extend shelf life, and protect contents from moisture, light, oxygen, and contamination. This is especially important in industries like food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, where product integrity is critical. Whether it’s a resealable snack pouch, a vacuum-sealed coffee bag, or a heat-sealed medical sachet, flexible packaging can be designed with consumer convenience and safety in mind. Add-on features such as zip locks, spouts, and easy-tear notches make usage simpler and more appealing. The surface of flexible packaging also offers a high-quality printable area, allowing brands to deliver compelling visuals and communicate product information clearly.

Sustainability is increasingly at the core of flexible packaging innovation. With consumers becoming more environmentally conscious, manufacturers are developing packaging solutions that align with circular economy principles. Recyclable films, compostable materials, and bio-based plastics are gaining traction as viable alternatives to traditional petroleum-based packaging. Some flexible packaging products are now designed for mono-material recycling, meaning they are easier to process through existing recycling streams. Others are being developed with reduced plastic content or made from renewable resources. These sustainable options not only reduce environmental impact but also enhance brand credibility in the eyes of eco-aware consumers. Retailers and manufacturers alike are recognizing that investing in sustainable packaging can drive long-term growth and loyalty.

As technology advances, the future of **flexible packaging products** looks even more promising. Smart packaging, which incorporates QR codes, RFID tags, and sensors, is being integrated into flexible formats to improve traceability, provide real-time information, and enhance the user experience. Digital printing allows for short-run customization and faster turnaround, supporting targeted marketing campaigns and limited-edition product lines. E-commerce is also fueling demand for durable, lightweight, and tamper-evident flexible packaging that can withstand shipping while maintaining brand aesthetics. With global packaging trends leaning toward minimalism, portability, and sustainability, flexible packaging products are well-positioned to lead the next generation of consumer packaging solutions.",1,1746084412.0,WriteNerds,0,1.0,False

## What is Evex 1 Pro?

Evex 1 Pro is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade financial assets using smart algorithmic tools. Think of it like having your own personal assistant that watches the markets 24/7 and makes trades based on the strategy you set—or lets the platform’s AI drive the trades for you.

The main goal? **Simplify trading** so that even if you have zero experience, you can still participate in markets like crypto or forex. It’s built to eliminate the need for deep technical analysis or staring at charts all day. Not everyone wants to be a full-time trader, right?

Evex 1 Pro operates similarly to other platforms like **Bitcoin Era** or **Immediate Edge**, offering automated features, real-time market scanning, and an intuitive dashboard. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it does a solid job making trading more accessible and less intimidating.

## Who Created Evex 1 Pro?

The creators behind Evex 1 Pro are a bit of a mystery—**there’s no official info on the developers or company** behind the platform. This is pretty common in the world of automated trading tools, especially ones that operate globally.

While that lack of transparency might raise an eyebrow, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a scam. Platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Bitcoin Era** also launched anonymously and still have thousands of active users.

That said, it would be nice if Evex 1 Pro gave us a little more background on the team. Transparency builds trust—and right now, they're relying mostly on the platform's performance and user experience to do the talking.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Evex 1 Pro Today](https://is.gd/I0z2PJ)

- The platform scans markets constantly using its AI engine.
- When it finds a match, it **executes the trade automatically**.
- You can monitor your trades or switch to manual mode if you prefer more control.

If you’re just starting out, the **demo account** helps you get familiar with the platform without risking real money. It’s a nice touch and something I always look for in a trading tool.

From my experience using it and comparing it with similar platforms, **Evex 1 Pro doesn’t feel like a scam**. It actually performs the trades it promises, withdrawals work (though they take a day or two), and the UI is polished.

However, it’s worth noting:

So while it’s not a scam, **use caution and only invest what you can afford to lose**, especially if you’re new to automated trading.

To get started, you’ll need to deposit at least **$250** into your account. This is pretty standard for automated trading platforms.

It’s not a one-click delete, but it’s doable without much hassle.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Evex 1 Pro Today](https://is.gd/I0z2PJ)

1kc2tbw,https://i.redd.it/sxeghykpf4ye1.png,One More Ride – Read the Complete Novel Online,"This was not right, I immediately rushed to the MC Club to find him.

I slipped into the dark hallway and went straight to his room.

""You, why are you here?"" Fifty grabbed me, looking unnatural

""I'm here to see Kane""I said.

“He was pretty screwed up last night, sweetheart. You might not want to find him right now,” he tries to warn me off.

My heart was pounding. This was not right.

A strong sense of uneasiness arose.

I pushed him aside, walked to the door and pushed it open.

The sight before me was like a sharp, fiery knife stabbing into my heart：

The room was full of undressed women.They posed in hot poses and twisted their bodies.

And Kane? There he was----Among the used rubbers and those undressed women.

————————

All night long I kept trying to close my eyes, but there was no way I could sleep. After I scraped myself up and got dressed, I moved to the couch. Staying in that bed was impossible. I don’t know how many times I checked my phone during the night only to find nothing. I almost called Cora, but I couldn’t bring myself to face the reality yet. I kept hoping that he would cool off and come home. I knew he was upset, but I honestly can’t believe he left me here all night and never even called or texted.

There’s only one place I know to look for him. I roll from the couch and grab my phone off the small side table. I quickly arrange an Uber and grab my bag, deciding to wait outside.

Stepping into the clubhouse, I’m hit hard with the lingering stench. This place reeks of smoke and stale beer, and whatever else they were doing in here last night. A few hungover gazes meet mine, but they’re all quiet as I inch through the room. I slip into the darkened hallway, heading straight for his room. My heart pounds against my chest as I reach the door, afraid of what I might find on the other side.

I take a deep breath and turn the knob. I don’t even bother knocking, I’m not giving him a chance to hide anything.It’s empty and his bed is still put together. If he’s not here, where is he?

I turn to leave and I hear another door open behind me. I glance over my shoulder to find Fifty’s towering frame. He pulls a dark t-shirt down over his tattooed torso and then runs his hand up over his face and hair. His eyes go wide when they stop on me.

“Where is he?” I ask simply and he starts to shrug, but I can already tell he knows something. “And don’t even think about lying for him. I just need to know…” my words hang for a second and he shakes his head. I can already feel the small pools gathering on my lower lids and my bottom lip begins to tremble.

“He was pretty screwed up last night, sweetheart. You might not want to find him right now,” he tries to warn me off but it’s not going to work. I told Kane that I wasn’t going to be one of those girls who would look the other way. I made it perfectly clear that if he wanted me to be his, then I was going to be the only one.

“Please, just tell me,” I try to appear strong, but my voice betrays me as my words shake.

“He disappeared into the dark room last I saw. I’m sorry, sweetheart,” his head drops and his hand runs over the back of his neck.

I turn back around without another word. As I step back into the large room, all eyes seem to move to me. They all know. I move towards the large black door, still closed from the party last night. My palm touches the wood and I push. It slides silently along the track, and despite the number of people who I know are watching, I think I could hear a pin drop.

My eyes move around the room, finding small clusters of half-undressed bodies, still sprawled across various pieces of furniture. He’s not hard to find. His large frame sits propped up, with his head back and his eyes closed. His t-shirt and cut still cling to his body, but my eyes fall to the mess of blonde hair resting in his lap.

My hands drop to my knees and a cold shiver runs over my skin as the breath leaves my body. I manage to push the vomit down and pull in a new fresh breath, filling my burning lungs. My teeth bite hard against my lip as the anger begins to quickly replace the repulsion.

I stand and turn, moving across the room towards the bar. I can feel everyone watching me, but I really don’t care anymore. Let them watch. I swipe a heavy white coffee mug from behind the bar and move back towards the open doorway.

“Ayla,” I hear Fifty’s voice behind me.

“Don’t,” I warn, letting my eyes burn into him for daring to speak to me right now. I lift my arm and let the mug fly. It hits the brick wall just to the left of Kane’s head and shatters loudly before falling in tiny pieces to the floor.

His eyes fly open and his body jumps. The noise seems to wake up most of the room, including the blonde in his lap. A new wave of nausea hits full force when she sits up and I realize that it’s the same girl from yesterday, the one he had obviously been with before. And she’s topless, on full display. My stomach rolls at the sight.

His wide eyes land on me and he stands. There are so many words on the tip of my tongue as I stand here staring at him in disbelief, but I just can’t make any of them come out.

“Ayla, I’m…” his voice is still thick with whatever he put in his system last night. My hand lifts to stop him before he can get any further. I’ve seen enough.

“Save it. I don’t want to hear your lies. You make me sick,” I turn and move towards the door in a daze.

The sun blinds me as I step outside into the fresh air. I need to get away from this place before he tries to follow me. I let my feet hit the pavement and I start to run. I turn the corner and don’t look back. I keep running until my lungs burn and my feet ache.

I finally slow to a walk, trying to catch my breath when I notice people in the distance. I can tell that I’m closer to town, but I’m not sure which direction I was running in, or how far I’ve gone. I rest my hands on my knees as I pull in a deep breath, but now the sobs kick in and I can’t seem to stop.

My phone rings in my back pocket and I manage to slide it out in time to see Cora’s name light up the screen. I answer in full blown sobs, no words at all.

“Ay…I need to know where you are,” her voice takes a sharp tone. “Fifty called Ryder. Tell me where you are and I’ll come get you.”

“I…I can’t. I need some time alone,” I manage to push out through my tears before hitting the end call button. She’s my best friend and I know she wants to help, but she’s with Ryder now and if I tell her where I am, I take the chance that Kane might find out where I am too. And I can’t handle him finding me right now. I just need a little time. I turn my phone to silent and slide it back into my pocket as I slowly pull myself together.

As I walk the tears continue to flow freely down my cheeks. I lose track of time and I can’t be sure how long I’ve been moving when I see the familiar golden arches. I’m not hungry, but I need a place to sit down and get my bearings while I decide what to do next.

The air-conditioned air tingles against my sweaty skin as I step through the door. I look around, and thankfully it’s quiet inside. I find a small table in the corner and pull my phone out before dropping into a chair. I see multiple missed calls and texts from both Cora and Kane, but I can’t deal with either of them right now. My throat is dry and burning, but I let my breathing start to settle before standing again and moving towards the counter.

“Hi, how can I help you?” a young girl with steaks of pink running through her hair asks.

“Umm,” my voice wobbles. “I’ll take a small Coke,” I say pulling a couple crumpled bills from my pocket and handing them to her. Only seconds later she’s handing me the ice-cold cup and a straw.

“Are you okay?” her question is soft and I feel my walls caving.

“No, not really,” I answer honestly as I rip the paper off my straw and drive it down through the plastic lid. “I’m from out of town and I got a little lost walking around. Could you tell me what street this is?” I ask.

“You’re on Herlong Ave.,” she smiles.

“Thanks,” I reply as I take my cup back to sit at the same table. I bring my lips to the straw and take a long drink. I’m glancing at my phone, debating whether or not to call Cora to have her come get me, when I see a message from a number I don’t recognize. I tap the screen and find that it’s from Fifty.

\*Hey – It’s Fifty. Cora gave me your number. Tell me where you are and I promise I’ll come alone.

I swallow hard and feel a fresh round of hot tears begin to stream silently down over my cheeks. I let my fingers move over the screen as I type a reply.

\*McDonalds on Herlong

I finish what’s left of my Coke and stand. I head towards the ladies’ room, dropping my empty cup in the trash on the way. Stepping inside the small bathroom, my eyes instantly lock on my ragged reflection in the mirror. I ignore it, and move to an open stall. I use the toilet and as I pull the paper back, I’m met with a bright red stain. In my panic I wipe again only to see more.

I can’t breathe. I roll some toilet paper around my hand and shove a wad into my panties as I quickly pull my bottoms back up. I quickly wash my hands at the sink. I need to get back out to the dining room and ask the clerk where I can find the closest emergency room or urgent care center. I step through the door and I see the dark leather. Fifty turns, locking me in his gaze.

“Ayla, darlin’, come here,” he opens his arms and I move forward, falling against him. My sobs are loud and uncontrollable as he holds my shaking body.

“I need…I need to go to the hospital,” my words are muffled against his chest. He pulls back slightly and looks down at me.

“Why?” he questions.

“Something’s wrong. I’m bleeding,” I explain through the tears.

“Bleeding?” he asks, the confusion clear in his voice.

“I’m pregnant, but now I’m bleeding. Something’s wrong,” I share and his face goes pale in response.

“That’s why Kane was so out of it last night,” the realization hits him and I nod. “C’mon,” he offers me his arm and leads me out the door towards a large silver truck.

## Key Features Analysis

The best motorbike cup holders offer a combination of secure mounting, durable construction, and compatibility with various cup sizes. These features ensure that your drink stays in place, even on bumpy roads, and that the cup holder can withstand the elements.

**Adjustable Clamp Diameter:**

The clamp diameter of a motorbike cup holder is crucial for ensuring a secure fit on your handlebars or other mounting points. A good cup holder will offer a wide range of adjustability, typically accommodating diameters from 0.75 inches to 1.5 inches. This versatility allows the cup holder to be installed on a variety of motorbike models and handlebar configurations. The adjustability is usually achieved through a screw-tightening mechanism or a quick-release clamp.

**Durable Construction Materials:**

The materials used in the construction of a motorbike cup holder directly impact its durability and resistance to the elements. High-quality cup holders are often made from materials such as aluminum alloy, stainless steel, or high-impact ABS plastic. These materials are chosen for their strength, corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand vibrations and temperature fluctuations. Aluminum alloy and stainless steel offer excellent durability and a sleek appearance, while ABS plastic provides a lightweight and cost-effective alternative.

**Universal Cup Size Compatibility:**

A versatile cup holder should be able to accommodate a wide range of cup and bottle sizes. This is typically achieved through an adjustable gripping mechanism or a flexible rubber insert. The cup holder should be able to securely hold standard-sized water bottles, coffee cups, and even larger beverage containers. Some cup holders also include features like adjustable arms or bases to accommodate irregularly shaped cups or bottles.

**Anti-Vibration and Anti-Slip Design:**

Motorbike riding can subject accessories to significant vibrations, which can cause cups to rattle or even spill. A well-designed cup holder will incorporate features to minimize vibration and prevent slippage. This may include rubber padding inside the cup holder to cushion the cup and reduce noise, as well as a non-slip base to prevent the cup from sliding around. Some cup holders also feature a secure locking mechanism to further prevent movement.

**Easy Installation and Removal:**

The ease of installation and removal is an important consideration for many motorbike riders. A good cup holder should be easy to install using basic tools and should not require any permanent modifications to the motorbike. Many cup holders utilize a clamp-on design that can be quickly attached and detached from the handlebars. Some cup holders also feature a quick-release mechanism that allows for easy removal when not in use.

Key features of the best cup holders for motorbikes include:
* Adjustable clamp diameter for versatile mounting
* Durable construction materials for long-lasting performance
* Universal cup size compatibility for various beverage containers
* Anti-vibration and anti-slip design for secure cup holding
* Easy installation and removal for convenient use

## Core Benefits

The primary benefit of a motorbike cup holder is the convenience of having a drink readily available while riding. This enhances comfort and safety by allowing riders to stay hydrated without having to stop frequently.

**Enhanced Hydration:**

Staying hydrated is essential for maintaining focus and energy levels during long rides. A motorbike cup holder allows riders to easily access their water bottle or other beverage without having to pull over. This is particularly beneficial during hot weather or on extended journeys where frequent stops can be inconvenient. By having a drink readily available, riders can stay hydrated and maintain optimal performance.

**Improved Safety:**

Reaching for a drink while riding can be dangerous, as it requires taking one hand off the handlebars and diverting attention from the road. A cup holder eliminates this risk by providing a secure and easily accessible place to store your beverage. This allows riders to stay focused on the road and maintain better control of the motorbike, enhancing safety for themselves and others.

**Increased Convenience:**

A motorbike cup holder adds a significant level of convenience to the riding experience. It eliminates the need to carry a drink in a backpack or other cumbersome storage solution. Riders can simply place their drink in the cup holder and enjoy it at their leisure. This is particularly useful for commuting, touring, or any situation where you want to have a drink readily available without sacrificing comfort or convenience.

**Reduced Spillage Risk:**

A well-designed cup holder minimizes the risk of spills, even on bumpy roads or during sudden maneuvers. Features like adjustable grips, rubber padding, and secure locking mechanisms help to keep the cup in place and prevent it from tipping over. This not only prevents messes but also ensures that you don't waste your drink.

1kc2nbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kc2nbr/my_wife_is_mad_because_i_made_plans_to_get_a/,My wife is mad because I made plans to get a drink with a woman.,"My (34M) wife (33F) is mad at me because I made plans to get a drink with a woman. Yes, I know this first part sounds bad, but there is a reasonable explanation. 

I will say that right now, my body is shaking, blood is boiling, cheeks are damp from just crying. This is toward the end of the unresolved argument. There is so much more to this than the headline, so let's start with a little background.

We both live in Los Angeles. I work in entertainment as a bitch boy to a successful and busy director. My wife makes decent money as a hair colorist at a busy salon. I feel like I am giving too many details, but it's all relevant. I work about 60 hours a week. She works about 30. She makes more money than me, but I think I am  making steps towards carving out a career, even if it can be brutal at times. I'm not a scaffolder, but it can be mentally draining keeping my bosses life and business afloat at the expense of letting my relationships and personal hobbies evaporate. It is exhausting having any job become your lifestyle. 

My wife and I frequently get into arguments about me making my work my identity. That I have changed since I've been in this industry. I used to be a barista for all of my 20s and had dreams of opening up a coffee shop. I would have been great at it and loved it, but I never would have had the opportunity to make enough money to open a coffee shop. 

My wife has been in the same field since I've known her. She has moved up the ranks though. Assistant to now having her own assistant. She is very talented, makes good money and has good hours. It's a great job and she will switch things up when she is ready. 

Context is almost fully downloaded....

We started dating in 2017. Got married in 2023. Been together for just about 8 years. 

When I was 29, January of 2020 (pandemic is right around the corner) I went back to community college out of fear that I am about to be thirty and have no education or skill set. At the time, my wife said going back to school would be a waste of time. I told her this is something I have to do. This is a lot for her because I would work from 7-3p and then take a bus to community college and be there from about 5-10pm. Classes and homework at the library. We started to rarely see each other and I felt a resentment but I had to go to school. 

Pandemic hits, I don't have to work now. I only have to take my classes and I get to do them online. Ace my first semester back and it was great! Felt good. Like I had control over my life for the first time ever. Ironically during COVID. Also, my wife who was my girlfriend at the time were fighting because we were seeing too much of each other. Before we were fighting because it wasn't enough. 

I was back in school getting my General Ed credits to pursue transferring to a four year to get a degree in screenwriting. I didn't know if I could cut it as a screenwriter but I thought a career in entertainment was the move. After my first semester, I got an internship at a production company, turned that into an assistant job, didn't return back to school and now I have been working in entertainment for 4 years. I have been with 3 different jobs in 4 years. 

Since I have been working in this field, I proposed to my girlfriend during Christmastime of 2021. We got married in spring of 2023. We both did not have money or a family with money to help with a wedding. We did courthouse style and a day at the beach with friends and family and it was beautiful. 

We love each other so much that the wedding didnt need to be anything. We could have gone to Vegas just us two and it would have been mission accomplished. We just wanted to commit to each other because we had been partners for 5 years and were ready to enter the next chapter together. 

Now married for 2 years, I am working this crazy busy job working for a busy director's assistant doing whatever he needs whether it's family, personal, home, current projects, upcoming projects, you name it. Literally anything he might need, I do it. This causes me to work atleast 8-8 some nights it goes until midnight. I complain, my wife tells me to bail, that it's not worth it.

I do appreciate her support and her being understanding and flexible, but sometimes I need her to tell me that I am crazy. That this is a great opportunity and that I need to stick this out. There are things happening. Opportunities I wouldn't get anywhere else, but I am obviously not the same person given the personal sacrifices. I love running and hiking and skating and cooking and watching movies and chilling and now I don't do that ever.

I know what you're thinking. Boohoo, baby has a job. A cool sounding job. I know!! Trust me I'm very grateful. I'll give you one more layer of context....

My childhood: Grew up in LA. Little brother (3 years younger). Single mother. She liked drugs (weed, pills, and what looked like tar). Dad wasn't around. Brother and I stank at school. Mom stank at working. We were evicted from every apartment in West LA and by the time I was 14, we were living in Mom's '94 Honda Accord. My mom, my little brother and me. Living in that car in parking lots and in hills. How we could catch a break from the car and stretch out a bit was by stealing dvds, blu rays and box sets and video games from Target. We would sell them to a video store on Venice blvd. Get enough cash to crash at a motel for a night or two. Ideally on a Wednesday so we could watch 'Lost'. This story takes so many twists and turns but just now that eventually Mom had a stint in jail to sober living. My dad stepped in to take my brother to San Bernardino to live with him. I lived with my grandma in LA for about six months while I completed my GED and then got a job. Yes, we had other family members in LA who tried to help the best they could get left us to our own homeless devices. So many more things happen.....

All of this is to say that working means something else to me. Hopefully that's enough context. My mom is severely mentally ill. My brother now has the curse. And somehow I made it out. I have a beautiful wife. Two cute dogs. A sweet apartment and a job that people have received masters for. I had a co worker that went to Harvard. 

My addiction: I have moved nicotine since I was 16 been smoking cigarettes, about a pack day until I was 33. I quit for a bit and then when I got the job I have now, I was vaping again. Had to vape to not smell like smoke. I think the nicotine had been helping me focus. I don't know.

I quit nicotine again about 3 months ago. I had a hard time focusing at work and stumbled across adderall. I really like it. It definitely is going everything I want it to do. I can focus all day. Work late hours. And I feel more capable. Less insecure. I truly think I need this, but I don't know if I would if I didn't have this job.

We are so close to that drink with the woman!! 

Now I work all the time. Take (prescribed) adderall and I don't feel as insecure which might come off as cocky. Idgaf though. 

My wife has given me a hard time about the adderall saying that it is meth. It's a drug. I've changed. Maybe I have, but I truly think it is making me better at what I need to be good at. I don't think I'm ever mean or selfish because of it. And also, she is on medication and I would never question her.

Now in entertainment, people will often get coffee, lunch or drinks and it is ""networking"". I recently worked on a tv show where I met a girl who I like (obviously only as a friend. She is sweet but I am not attracted to her. And I'm married). We made plans to get drinks since my time on the show had come to an end. 

FINALLY, THE DRINK PLANS:

I call my wife while on the road, running an errand for my boss. Day is wrapping up a bit early at 7:30p. She asks if we need to go to the laundromat to do laundry. I say yes. We have to go tonight, because I made plans to get drinks tomorrow (Thursday) and I need clean clothes ahead of the weekend.

My wife is like ""what do you mean drinks? With who?"" I say nonchalantly, ""oh this girl I met on set. I told you about her. You're both from the same town"". 

When she heard girl, she was triggered. Shocked that I could make plans on a Thursday. That I could get out early to network. That I would go network when I only talk shit about networking. And that I don't think it's weird that I would get a drink with a straight girl without telling her.

I was shocked. I was angry. My disposition was like, ""I am my own person. I can get drinks with whoever I want. This is a work thing. Do you joe trust me? I don't even know if she's straight. She's not even my type"". Blah blah blah. At that point I was grossed out that I had to defend myself to make her feel better. I wouldn't be angry like that if it were her getting a drink with a straight guy. I swear, I wouldn't. She has straight male friends. Well at least one close one that I really like. 

There are even more nuisances that I can't get into, but I stuck to my guns. She was upset that I didn't tell her about these plans. I am upset that I know have to tell her about any plan I make? She was upset that I told her so nonchalantly. It was because I was being nonchalant. I didn't know there was an issue. 

I told my wife that I don't think it is just about the drink with a girl. I said that this is either an insecurity coming from her end or a resentment towards my job/me being unavailable.

My wife went on to say that she is over talking about my life. My job. My problems. I get it. I think my BS can take center stage. When I asked about the insecurity/jealousy and compared it to a couple of other recent jealousy issues she went off on me. Screaming. Saying I'm a pathetic loser. I have a pathetic career. That she is so sick of being with me. That the adderall is making me crazy and aggressive. She said she wants to end things. 

At this point I am ready to go to an insane asylum. My wife is screaming at me, all of our neighbors are listening for sure, throwing things, hitting the wall and then saying I'm aggressive.

Yes, I did raise my voice while trying to express that I wasnt apologetic about making these drink plans. The girl is a homie and I can do what I want. Also, there was nothing going on! It is what I'm saying it is and my wife said I am being sneaky about it. Hiding something. 

Everything she says the adderall is doing to me is doing to her. Like I should stop taking it so she can stop feeling aggressive and combative. 

I know she loves me, and i know I love her, so much, but at what point is it worth it? Maybe we should end things? She said so many hurtful things, i started crying. It takes a lot for me to cry.

She called me a loser and said she didn't want tk be with me when i am exhausted from trying my best. Maybe my best isn't good enough so let me be alone. Be with someone who won't let you down. 

I think somethings just run their course. I didn't know our marriage was on the line this morning and now after our fight and her calling me worthless (even if she didn't mean it) has me wanting to end it. Fuck it. Life is short.


So what do you think? AITAH for making plans to get a drink with another woman? I don't think so.

AITAH for seriously thinking about divorcing her for an outburst that was probably induced by my bullshit? Even if my bullshit is innocent? 

AITAH for thinking adderrall is super sweet and that my life feels a lot more manageable with it? 

Please give me your honest thoughts. I need help! ",0,1746083152.0,AITAH,18,0.4,False

Paityn (Pay-tin) Mary Thompson's POV:  
  
""Paityn!""  My boss, Catherine Johns, yelled from her office.  
  
""Coming!""  I called and quickly jumped up from my desk that was right outside of her door.  
  
Catherine is the head of this department of Binder and John's Attorneys at Law.  Yes, her husband is one of the owners of this law firm.  They have more than one location.  This location is in Manhattan and is the one that she runs while her husband and Mr. Binder are at another in New Jersey.  Now, Catherine isn't an attorney, she just makes sure all the paralegals at this location do what they need to do, whatever she thinks that is.  
  
Mr. Johns needed to go to the location in New Jersey because they were expanding and hiring several more attorneys to help and just sent all the paralegals over here for Catherine.  She's not really anything either, just passes the orders from her husband or Mr. Binder to everyone else.  She just got the job because she's Mr. Johns' wife and she begged for it, more like bribed.  We all know about it too because we could hear those two going at it in his office when he was still here.    
  
At that time I was his legal secretary but when she took over this location, I became hers.  I don't do half the stuff for her that I did for him.  I'm not a paralegal or anything, I just make the deliveries to the courthouses or to the other attorney location in New Jersey along with a lot of work with legal documents.  I answer the calls that are sent to her but she didn't want to answer them anymore so now I do instead and either continue the call to her, or I send them straight to her voicemail.   
  
She's lazy as hell too.  I have to get her coffee, lunch, and anything else she wishes.  I have to file her files for her, get more files, make up the case packets and get everything around to get to the lawyer that is on the case.  I never had to do the little things like getting coffee or lunch for her husband.  I actually did more legal secretarial work.  Now I feel I'm just at her beck and call and it drives me nuts!  This is not what the thousands of dollars paid for in college.  
  
My husband, Isaiah Michael Thompson keeps telling me that I need to just quit.  We fight about this all of the time.  Since we got married he has wanted me to stay home.  At the time we were barely making ends meet and I loved my job.  That was before Catherine took over.  Now she and I just butt heads all the time and she is always having me do useless work and sometimes I don't get out of the office until late at night.    
  
He just told me last night that we make enough now that I don't have to keep working for her and to just quit but I just can't.  I don't know why but I don't want to quit my job.  I guess I keep hoping that maybe they will open up another branch and I can either work over there and away from her or she can go to the new branch because I highly doubt she will ever quit or get fired.    
  
I quickly finished writing the last thing I needed down on a sticky note quick so I wouldn't forget and got up from my desk and walked into her office.  It's not like I'm that far from her.  I'm just right outside her door but she would rather scream at me from in her office than pick up the phone and call me or walk a few feet from her desk to get me.  
  
""You need to hurry and get these files to Mr. Johns at the courthouse in New Jersey right away!  The time for court just got changed to one this afternoon and they need the updated files.  A new witness has been added for questioning and they are getting called to the stand today!""  She said quickly and held the files over her desk towards me.  
  
""Yes, ma'am,""  I told her.  
  
She feels that she is too important now that she runs this office to be called Mrs. Johns or Catherine so we are required to call her ma'am.  I don't think anyone here cares to call her that but they don't really say much because they aren't the ones that get stuck listening to her all of the time as I do.  I'd rather call her b\*\*\*h but I think that would get me fired and I would rather not.  If I lost this job that means Isaiah wins in the running argument we have had for the last four years of marriage.  
  
I grabbed the several files that she had in her hand and I walked quickly out of her office and back to my desk.  I grabbed my purse and put my phone back in it and put the strap over my shoulder and headed out of the office building.  I walked quickly to the elevators and pushed the button to go down.  I looked up and saw it going from one floor to the next and then stopping.  It was picking more up on its way down!  
  
I looked down at my watch to see how much time I had to get to the other office and it said 11:30.   
  
""Shit.""  I hissed to myself.  
  
Why does she do this all of the time!  That's barely enough time to get to that other office let alone for them to go over the files for the new witness!  
  
Just then the elevator dinged, letting me know that it finally got to the tenth floor that I was on and could finally head down.  Once the doors opened, a flood of people walked out, practically knocking me over.  It's not like they couldn't see me or anything.  I'm 5'8 and I'm standing in two-inch heals right now.  They just have attitude, I think, when they are coming back from lunch.  I mean I wouldn't want to come back and deal with Catherine either.  
  
I just got into the elevator and pushed the ground floor when my phone started to ring.  I almost dropped the files trying to fish my phone out of my purse while a few other people started to push their way into the elevator.  I stepped back towards the corner and answered my phone.  
  
'Hello?""  
  
""Paityn!  On your way back stop at the deli and get a club sandwich with light mayo and no tomato. Make sure it's on flatbread.""  Catherine, the b\*\*\*h, ordered.  
  
""Yes ma'am, but you do realize that it's going to be after one before I get back.  Maybe you should walk across the street and get it.  It would be faster....""  I was trying to tell her so I could try to get back and get more of my work down that I haven't had a chance to do all day but she cut me off.  
  
""Like I have that kind of time!  Besides, I told you to do it and I can't risk the chance of breaking one of my heals on that awful sidewalk in front of that deli again.""  She complained on the other end.  
  
""Sure,""  I mumbled.  
  
""I will grab one on the way back,""  I told her, rolling my eyes as I was about ready to end the call when she started to talk again.  
  
""Oh, and make sure you get a light mocha from the café around the block before you come back.  Extra vanilla and have them put some of that whipped cream on top.""  She added.  
  
""Aren't you trying to go on a diet?""  I asked her.  
  
""I am, that's why I told you to get a light mocha, not the regular of course.""  She said sarcastically and I swear I could feel her roll her eyes just like I did to her.  
  
She didn't bother to wait for me to end the call, she ended it as soon as she was done listening to herself talk.  I started to shove my phone back into my purse when I started to get pushed out of the elevator by everyone who was just heading to their turn on lunch.  I dropped my phone in the process and it got stepped on, causing it to crack the screen.  
  
""Dammit!""  I said out loud, maybe a little too loud but no one seemed to notice or they just didn't care because they were too worried about being the first one in line at their favorite diner.  
  
I picked it up and inspected the damage.  It still worked but it's going to need to be repaired and replaced.  Even with the screen protector on it still got cracked pretty bad.  Must have been someone's heels landing on it that caused it.  
  
I just shoved it into my purse quickly and looked at my watch, it was now a quarter till noon and I wasn't even out of the building yet.  I picked up my pace without actually running and headed towards the doors of the building. I ran through them, almost losing the files again, and quickly grabbed them to keep them from falling out of my arms.    
  
I wasn't looking anywhere but down at my arms when I walked out into the bright sun and ran into something really hard.  I mean really hard!  It felt like I ran headfirst into a brick wall that was put in front of the doors sometime after I came into work this morning.  I yelped from the sudden impact and lost my balance in my heels, snapping one of the heels as I stumbled, causing me to fall backwards and throwing my files as I went down.  
  
I didn't bother to say sorry or anything.  I was too busy panicking over the files that were now out of their folders and on the sidewalk.  All I could think of was getting myself fired over this if these are mixed up.  Thank goodness Catherine had each one paperclipped so I just had to match the corresponding file with their matching stack of papers.  
  
""I'm so sorry miss.""  I heard a deep voice say but I wasn't paying attention or thinking of anything other than getting myself back on my feet and out of here.  
  
""s\*\*t, I'm going to be so late.""  I just kept mumbling till my eyes stopped running all over the papers when I saw a muscular hand, covered in tattoos reaching down in front of me to help pick up the mess.  
  
My heart started beating like crazy at the thought of what kind of person I may have just run into.  Who did I just piss off and ruin their day?  I didn't want to look into his face, scared of what I might see so I quickly pulled the papers from his hands that he had when he was helping me and shoved them quickly back into the folders, not caring what folders I had them in.  I will sort them out on the cab ride to the other office.  
  
""Thank you.""  I just quickly said and went to stand up, completely forgetting that one of my heels was broken and I stumbled into his hard chest.  
  
""s\*\*t,""  I whispered as I had my arm around my folders, pinned between his body and mine and my right hand clutching his arm.  
  
Damn his arm feels huge!  I just stood there, in shock holding him with my eyes wide open and slowly breathing as if I thought if he couldn't hear me breathe he wouldn't know that I was still standing there squeezing his arm.    
  
Just the thought of him was sending my mind all over the place.  His deep masculine voice, the glimpse of his tattoos on his hand, the size of his arms, and the scent of his body mixed with his cologne.  I felt like I was committing adultery and I hadn't even looked at the face of the man I was sinning with.  I am so going to need to get to church after this and confess my sins.  
  
""I think your shoe may be broke,""  I heard him say with a hint of a laugh laced in his voice.  
  
I slowly leaned away from him and looked down and lifted my right foot up and saw that the heel was busted and barely hanging on.     
  
""Damn, another pair I have to throw away.""  I snapped at myself in the disappointment of having to spend more money on shoes.  
  
I reached down and pulled the heel off of the shoe and stepped away from him so I could check the other shoe as well, making sure that I didn't look at him.  I just don't want to be watching the news this evening and find out that I ran into some serial killer who is now targeting me because I saw his face and then saw him on the news of the most wanted.  
  
I just started walking away with a limp in my step from missing my heel, looking for a cab to wave down.  
  
""You know, you're kind of a bitch.""  I heard that man say and without thinking, I just turned around and glared at him.  
  
""What did you call me?""  I asked and that's when I realized I probably just made the biggest mistake of my life.  
  
I saw what he looked like.  He was definitely huge like I thought.  Not overweight or anything but very tall.  Taller than Isaiah, my husband, by a few inches at least, and his chest and shoulders were very muscular in size.  His hair was a dark brown, almost black and it was pulled back into a tight ponytail.  The sides of his head were shaved all the way to the skin and was covered in tattoos on the left side of his head.  My eyes landed on this huge scar that went from just to the side of his left eye and jagged down his cheek to his mouth. The way the scar was it pulled on the skin around and it misshapen his mouth.  He also had a nose ring on the right side of his nose and a loop ring on the left side of his lower lip.  
  
If it wasn't for the scar and all of his tattoos covering his head and neck and who knows where else and those piercings, he actually would be rather handsome.  Maybe, in a dangerous mafia type of way.  
  
""There, that's better.  Now you look at me and say something other than cussing at yourself.""  He said almost sarcastically.  
  
""Look, I don't have the time right now.  I have to get these to New Jersey in less than....""  I said looking at my watch quickly to see what time it was.  
  
""An hour. My shoes are broken so now I have to buy a new pair and I'm probably going to lose my job if I don't get these dropped off before one.""  I told him sharply.  
  
""Would you like a ride to your destination?""  He asked and I c\*\*\*\*d my head a little and looked at him unsure.  
  
""It's the least I can do for causing you to break your shoes and possibly make you lose your job.""  He said with a smile.  
  
I looked around me to make sure there were plenty of witnesses nearby to see me conversing with him just in case my body wound up in the Hudson River with all of my limbs chopped off.  
  
""Don't worry, I don't bite, much.""  He said as he laughed and held his hand out.  
  
I stared at his hand and slowly reached for it with a shaky hand.  He quickly grabbed my hand and before I knew it, I was picked up bridal style with my files squeezed between my arm and body.  
  
""My ride is a block away and you don't need to be walking on these sidewalks with those shoes.""  He said and I just remained quiet.  
  
It was bad enough that I'm going to go to Hell for being in another man's arms while I was married let alone the possibility of being murdered today.  He took long strides down the sidewalk and around the corner before he stopped beside a motorcycle.  He set me down and threw his leg over the seat of the bike and revved it up.  
  
""Well?  Are you going to get on or are you going to look for a different job?""  He asked me over the sound of his bike's engine.  
  
I took another look around just to make sure there were still plenty of people around and hopefully these stores had good cameras.  He revved it up a few more times, snapping me out of my paranoid thoughts and I threw my leg over the bike, causing my skirt to ride up on my legs.  
  
""Hold on!""  He called to me and I squealed as he took off from the side of the road and I threw my arm around his body, squeezing the files with a death grip.  
  
""Where to?""  He asked me as we traveled down the road, in and out of the cars that were waiting to get through the stoplights.  
  
""Binder & Jones Attorney's at Law in New Jersey,""  I yelled to him, hoping he would hear me and knew where it was.  
  
He must have because just then he hit the gas more and I closed my eyes behind his back, trying to hold in my screams.  I had never been on a motorcycle before but I was quickly realizing that I hated it and I was certain that I was going to die!  
  


# Chapter 2

Paityn's POV:  
  
""Looks like we are here.""  I heard him say as I felt him slow down and pull over.  
  
""You can open your eyes now.""  He said as he laughed.  
  
I slowly pulled my face away from his body and peeked out at our location.  I was very surprised to see that we were parked by the law office that I needed and not in an abandoned warehouse somewhere by the river or loading docks.  I mean we are in a no-parking zone but at least we are here.  
  
""I can wait for you if you like.""  He asked when  I stepped off of the bike and onto the sidewalk, stumbling again because I forgot the one shoe was broken.  
  
""Why would you do that?""  I asked and turned back around to look at him.  
  
Yeah, he is definitely not my type.  The way that he looks sitting on that bike just tells me that whatever he does for a living is not legal.  s\*\*t Paityn!  Really?  You're married, you shouldn't be looking at him as if you were seeing if he ranked high enough for a repeated affair!  
  
""Well, for one, you probably should be taken to get  another pair of shoes, and two, I'm sure I will get you back to work in  time so you don't lose your job.""  He said with a half-smirk on his face because his scar restricted the movement of his lip a little.  
  
Was he flirting with me?  Do I want him to flirt with me?  What!  No,  definitely not!  I just turned quickly and almost ran into the building the best that I could.  My body practically bounced up and down as I  went through the hallway but I didn't care what anyone thought.  I just quickly walked through the lobby to the elevators and pushed the button.  I pushed it again and again trying to get it to move a little faster.  I needed to get up there quickly but for some reason, I felt as if I was running from that man.  
  
""Come on.""  I practically growled at it with clenched teeth.  
  
As soon as the doors opened, I practically leaped into the elevator and spun around, and hit floor five as fast as I could.  I let out a sigh of relief when the doors started to close and no one managed to get in with me.  I needed my moment alone to calm myself down.  
  
My eyes widened in shock and I sucked in a deep breath when that man that gave me a ride over here slid between the closing doors.  I really felt short now compared to him because I was standing on the shoe with no heel and I stepped back, hitting my back on the wall behind me as the elevator started its lift up.  
  
""You know.....""  He said in a deep tone and hit his fist on the emergency stop button on the elevator panel.  
  
I gasped and quickly looked back up at him in fear.  I knew it.  I just knew it!  He's going to slaughter me here in this elevator at a law office of all places!  
  
""You should be more careful who you are a rude b\*\*\*h to.""  He said in a sinister voice and took a step closer to me.  
  
""Like you're any less of a bitch.""  I blurted out and he just laughed.  
  
I looked over again at the elevator panel to see if there was a call for help button but I jumped a little when he spoke again, now using a  more dominating voice.  
  
""I wouldn't think about it if I was  you.""  He said more sternly as he placed his hand on the wall over my  head and leaned into me  
  
I almost had a disgusted look on my face when I smelled the scent of cigarettes on his breath.  My father died of lung cancer and my mother is currently on oxygon all because they were heavy smokers.  I vowed that I would never pick up a cigarette or get involved with a man who smoked.  I got lucky with Isaiah, he's never smoked either even though most of his family does.  
  
""Please,  I-I'm sorry,  I was in a hurry,""  I told him as my voice trembled.  
  
I couldn't help the way he was making me feel.  My heart was beating frantically and my legs were getting weak and felt like jello.  They were going to collapse from underneath me at any time if I didn't get myself out of this predicament.  
  
Yet, regardless of how much I  wanted to get out from between him and this wall, I also didn't want to.  He was causing excitement in me that I hadn't felt in a long time.   Actually, I don't think I've ever felt like this before, not even with  Isaiah when we were dating in college.  Even my first time having s\*x I  don't think I felt this kind of excitement in my core before.  Is it the thought of going to Hell causing me to feel like this?  Is it the danger that I could be in that is making me want more?  
  
He lifted his hand and brushed the back of his fingers down the side of my face and I closed my eyes.  His hand traveled down to my chin and he grabbed with his fingers and tilted my chin up, causing me to open my eyes and look straight into his.  His eyes were probably the most gorgeous thing about him.  Their baby blue color distracted you from everything else you saw on him.  I also didn't see anything in them to suggest that he was in there to hurt me.  After a moment of just staring into his eyes and him staring into mine, he reached over and hit the button on the panel and the elevator started back up again.  
  
He lowered himself to my level and placed his lips upon mine.  At first,  all I thought about was how I was cheating on Isaiah and I wanted to pull away but I couldn't.  The way his lips felt on mine, the movement of his lip ring as it rubbed the soft skin of my lips, it was all sending electricity down my spine causing me to want more.  Then I was reminded of who he was by the taste and scent of smoke on his breath.  I  remembered that I was married and the fact that I was kissing a  complete stranger who could have a line of dead bodies that the police have yet to find and the fact that I could be next on his list.  
  
I pushed him away hard on his chest, causing him to pull away from me and I glared up at him.  
  
""I'm married,""  I told him and the sound of the elevator reaching the next floor went off and I slid out from under his arm and took off.  
  
I looked back quickly and saw him walking in the opposite direction.   He didn't care where he was or how he looked, he just walked as if he owned the place and belonged where ever it was that he was.  I placed the fingers of my free hand over my lips and dazed back to that kiss.   What was that?  What kind of man just does that as if it was nothing?   Why do I feel that I enjoyed it?  No, I couldn't be enjoying the kiss.   It's not the kiss or him that I liked it was the adrenaline rush I got from possibly getting caught.  That's it.  It has nothing to do with him or the kiss, it was the fear and excitement of it all.  
  
""Good afternoon Mrs. Thompson.  I see your shoes broke again?""  The floor secretary asked me jokingly, causing me to jump a little and pull me back to reality.  
  
""They really need to fix that sidewalk,""  I  told her, hoping that I wasn't blushing because of what just happened in the elevator and she just laughed.  
  
No, this is not the first time I have walked through here with broken shoes on.  It has actually turned into a running joke with a few of the paralegals and the secretaries.  Apparently, they classify me as a clutz even though I  didn't think that many misfortunes happened to me.  I just have bad luck with shoes.  
  
I looked down at my watch and saw that it was almost 12:30.  Wow!  He got me all the way to the other side of the river in 30 minutes!  I knew he was driving like a mad man but wow!  I  took a deep breath to try to calm my nerves from the worry of being late and losing my job.  I quickly walked past the cubicles of the paralegals who were busy typing away and talking on the phones.  I got to Mr. Johns' office and I knocked on the door.  There wasn't any answer so I tried to turn the knob but it was locked.  I peeked around to try to look through the blinds of the side windows but they were closed shut.  
  
""You missed him.  He left for the courthouse about 20  minutes ago.""  His personal secretary said as she walked back to her desk.  
  
""s\*\*t!  He needs these files!""  I said and turned to run out of the building.  
  
""You better hurry!  The traffic is like mad out there right now!""  I heard her call to me as I ran past the cubicles again.  
  
Get there fast?  Did she see the condition of my shoes!  I got to the elevator and started to push the button down over and over.  I felt like  I was starting to sweat from the adrenaline that was going through my body.  It's a good thing I'm in shape and run every morning before coming into work or I may not be able to do this.    
  
The doors finally opened and I ran in and pushed the ground floor button right away.  I looked up and watched it count down the floors, praying that it didn't stop at any other floor on its way down.  I looked down at my watch to see the time only to get more frantic about how little time I had to get across New Jersey to the courthouse.  As soon as the elevator stopped I was practically forcing the doors open while other people were trying to get in.  I pushed my way through them and ran down the hall to the entrance.  
  
I got around the corner just to see through the big glass windows and doors, that man was putting his leg over his bike.  There's no way I will get to the courthouse in time if I had to call a cab.  I had to just do it and I ran through the doors waving my free hand in the air while yelling at him.  
  
""Hey!""  He must not have heard me or cared, one or the other so I yelled at him again.  
  
""Hey, tattooed asshole!""  I shouted and he looked over at me and got off of his bike.  
  
""Oh, s\*\*t,""  I mumbled and stopped in my tracks and took a step back.  
  
""You know, you really do have a potty mouth on you.  Maybe it's time I  did something about that.""  He said in a low tone that sent chills down my spine and walked closer to me.  
  
""I, ah, I'm sorry.  I didn't know your name or what to call you.  You didn't respond when I was  yelling hey so that......""  I started to say, practically begging for my life as I spoke.  
  
""So you felt calling me a tattooed asshole  would be the perfect name to call me?""  He asked and stopped when he was right in front of me and I had to crank my head up to look at him.  
  
""It got your attention didn't it?""  I asked and his eyes started to travel all over my body.  
  
""You don't need to call me names to get my attention.""  He said with a  smirk as his eyes came back up from my chest to my face.  
  
I  gasped and glared at him, feeling disrespected even though I did call him a name but it's not like I didn't try to get his attention more nicely before that.  Besides, I wasn't the one looking as if I was standing there naked.  
  
""Look, just forget it.  I will  figure it out myself.""  I told him and I started to walk away from him only to realize I was going in the wrong direction so I had to turn around and walk back the other way.  
  
""Okay.""  He said as if he didn't really care and turned and got back on his bike.  
  
I stopped and I looked at my watch again and saw that I was down to 15  minutes to get these files to the attorneys.  He turned the bike on and revved it up.  I just sighed and quickly walked over beside him before he could drive off.  He took his hands off the handles and leaned back a  little and looked over at me.  
  
""Can you give me a ride to the  courthouse?""  I asked in a nicer tone and he crossed his arms over his chest and smiled at me.  
  
""I'm sure you could say that a little nicer than that.""  He said, continuing his smile.  
  
I looked around and didn't see a single taxi on the road for me to call.  I looked at my watch again and felt like I could hear the seconds counting down.  
  
""Could you please give me a ride?  I need to be there before one.""  I told him and tried to give him a small smile.  
  
""That sure isn't much time.  I don't know if I can get you there that fast.  You may have to wait for a taxi.""  He tried being sarcastic.  
  
I just threw my leg over the bike and put my arm around his body.  
  
""Just go, please!""  I said into his ear and he revved up the bike again before he jolted off away from the sidewalk.  
  
Just like the last time, once he was on the main roads he was weaving in and out of the traffic and speeding down the roads.  I closed my eyes because I was too scared to peek.  I didn't want to see the crash before it happened.  
  
I looked up when I felt him stop the bike in front of the courthouse.  I looked down at my watch and saw it was ten minutes till.  I hopped off quickly and was getting ready to head down the sidewalk when he spoke up.  
  
""I think you owe me.""  He said and I looked over my shoulder as I was walking.  
  
""What?""  I said back to him but kept walking.  
  
I was on a deadline and I didn't have time for small talk.    
  
""You owe me!""  He yelled and I just waved behind me and continued up the steps and into the courthouse.  
  
I got through the metal detectors easily since all I had on me was my purse and the files.  I quickly went through the hallway and around the corner.  
  
""Mr. Johns!""  I called when I saw him at the doors to the courtroom, talking with someone.  
  
""Ah, Mrs. Thompson.  Catherine told me you were on your way.  I was  starting to think you weren't going to get here in time.""  He told me with a smile.  
  
""Sorry, I got here as quick as I could,""  I told him and he just nodded and looked down at my feet.  
  
""Broken shoe again?""  He asked and I just nodded.  
  
""I'm thinking you need to give up on having heels.""  He joked and the guy he was standing with laughed as well and I just handed him the files and turned around and walked away.  
  
I wasn't really in the mood for more shoe jokes.  I got to the metal detectors again and had to give them my purse to check and walked through.  I started towards the doors only to feel my heart start to pick up speed again.  I just remembered that he was out there.  I stopped and looked around, almost not wanting to walk back out there and see him again.    
  
I  looked down at my watch and saw that it was a few minutes after one.  I  really need to get back to work.  I have so much crap to do and all this did was waste half of my day.  There's no way I will get out of work on time today.  
  
I took a deep breath and just walked out of the building.  I covered my eyes with my hand to help shield them from the sun till they could adjust to the light.  I looked around and saw that he wasn't there on the road any longer.  I felt so relieved and a smile grew on my face.  I was glad he wasn't there anymore. I don't want to ever see him again.  
  
I walked down the steps to the road and raised my hand to call a cab.  First thing, new shoes.  Second, a quick sandwich for lunch and then back to work.Chapter 1",1,1746082756.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I have a history of alcoholism and seizures, the latter of which I take medication for (Levebon). I do not work out regularly nor do I work a physically demanding job. I drink alcohol regularly, drink a lot of coffee, and smoke about ten cigarettes a day. I do not consume cannabis or other substances. I am diagnosed with ADHD. Otherwise, I am not experiencing any relevant mental or physical issues.

During the past couple of months, multiple people have commented on my right calf being noticeably bigger than my left one. Last night, I measured both of them. My legs were fully extended from a sitting position. My left calf's (the normal one) circumference measured 34cm, whereas my right one's was 41cm. 

Ever since having gone through aforementioned seizure, my right leg has been sore basically all the time. It's not painful per-se, but noticeable. It hurts the most when I get out of bed after waking up. Substance consumption (caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol) doesn't seem to have an effect. I'm a hydro-homie and generally eat healthy. I also tend to walk everywhere instead of driving. I've tried wearing different shoes, but to no avail.

Priorities:

Somewhere kinda cool. Coffee, bars, etc. preferably not surrounded by thousands of undergraduates. A reasonably lively area is ideal, just not excessive.

I don’t have a car, and am hoping I won’t need one. Planning to cycle around, when necessary, so walking distance from campus is good but not critical.

1kc2bk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1kc2bk5/you_can_bounce_back_significantly_in_a_day/,You can bounce back significantly in a day,"A few days ago I had another relapse early morning, around 8am. Every time i relapse i get a sense of dread and despair. I often have thoughts along the lines of “when will i change?” “Why cant I beat this/change?” “What am i doing wrong” “why am I so weak” . Other times I just sigh and think the same thoughts but more in a defeated tone rather than a wailing tone.

Very rarely do I relapse and get filled with that fire like “fuck. Fuck waiting i need to bounce back right tf now”. Relapsing most definitely drains you of your mental and physical energy but don’t forget you are the captain on the helm of the ship. Each choice you make is a small Victory or a surrender. These small choices add up. So you can choose your next step, don’t forget that.

So after this relapse i get filled with a sort of rage. I decide to continue crushing my day as I had planned to before the relapse. First things first i went to the gym. 

Andddd I couldnt even do a single dip. I was that weak physically. Mind you, i swim, wrestle in college, and have been active physically for years. This wasnt normal. But then again I had relapsed. I did some halfass reps of some other machines at the gym and hit the sauna for a bit then returned home. I noticed i was crankier , i snapped at my mom and siblings impatiently, and i drank coffee with a ton of sugar.
Usually after a relapse i make the very bad mistake of giving in to the rest of my bad habits for the rest of the day. So i watched movies for a few hours, watched useless random rap music videos, scrolled thru reels. I was really feeling like shit and i didnt want to interact with anyone.

Yet that fire still lingered somewhere in me. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different outcomes. I had to make the change. I couldnt afford to wait a few days for those SR benefits to slowly start coming back.
I HAD to rush the process- do something, anything to get me back to that winner warrior I always wanted to be. 

So i decided id act on that fiery urge to do better once more. This time I first threw away the junk food in my hands and shut off the movies (that coincidentally contained triggering scenes). I went to the restroom and looked in the mirror. I looked scruffy and tired and just ROUGH.
Fuck that- i spent anywhere from 20-45 minutes doing the following- deep cleaning teeth/mouth, cleansing face, cleaning up beard, looking good smelling good etc.
It involved beef tallow for skin, ice for face skin, bentonite clay and hydrogen peroxide for oral health, flouride free toothpaste for teeth, taking a cold shower,  combing and shaving, and charcoal bar soap for face - not in that order.

Next to get the internals right - i took bee pollen, honey with salt, some taurine and creatine. Basically i just took the healhiest stuff i could find in my kitchen.

I think literally just taking some time to freshen up and look good spills over to your internal mindset and self esteem- especially after a relapse when the negative thoughts come flowing.

One thing that this little self care routine taught me is that putting even a bit of effort into at least cleaning your face and feeling fresh can go a long way.

That done, i headed over to the gym again. This time with newfound conviction and the flame still burning. I only did two exercises- pull ups and seated rows ( the ones with the chest blocker). For pull ups I spammed them. For once in a very long time i went to failure. I took it seriously, and although the sapping of my strength from the relapse earlier was still being felt, i pushed (or pulled) through the weakness. Same with the rows, i pulled with all my strength and energy until there was nothing left. Now im an avid gym goer and an athlete. But one thing I realized was how much i stay in the comfort zone even while training. I take the path of least resistance. However after this gym sesh of me genuinely pushing myself HARD i felt better than most of my training. On top of that I had relapsed earlier and now I was killing it in the gym !

Hit the sauna, went home n took another shower and ate a good meal of eggs n ground beef.
I dont know about you guys but usually after a relapse the first 1-4 days are uneventful and I dont feel any SR benefits. And many of us know some of the most potent benefits come after months and months of SR. 

However this time felt like I had a cheat code. I understand a bit deeper now what “make the days count” means. It includes that day you relapsed as well. Even things like taking a nap (recharge), getting sun, eating super food like honey, all these help. You dont need to wait til day 5. Make each day count. This is probably the first time I relapsed and still had a successful day. Life is what you make of it and your SR journey is what you make of it as well. Dont expect the benefit of improved social skills on day 6 of SR while you have been secluded at home for day 1-5 of your streak, for example. 
(Although you still may get some improvement just by SR - thats how powerful it is - but thats a subject for another day)

I guess Im saying all this to encourage you and I to  waste no time in self defeat and overthinking after a relapse and take the steps to better yourself immediately after a relapse- whether they be big or as small as refusing to be look physically drained and tired.

1kc2bdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kc2bdy/aith_for_not_trusting_my_sister_again/,AITH for not trusting my sister again?,"(English is not my first language, and I apologise this is going to be a long one)

So me (F27) and my sister (24) has always been close, until something happened about 5 years ago (she and her boyfriend broke up and she found out he's been texting other girls) so she started having trust issues (fair enough).

She went out to party a lot and alcohol became an escape from her feelings and the world in general. 2 years go by and she meets a man (who is so kind to her and really loves her with all of his heart) after this my sister stopped drinking alcohol and haven't touched it since. (I really love that for her)

But something in her personality just changed, she suddenly needed attention like ALL the time, everytime she went out with her friends or just needed to go groceryshopping she always asked ""does this look good on me? How is my hair? Is my makeup okay?"" (She's been asking these questions everyday for 3 years, and I want to point out, she is a VERY beautiful girl and she knows it)
Every weekend I would come by with a coffee for my sister and we would chat, I started to realise she became more and more selfish and if she didn't like something it was everyone else's fault (for example, she got fired from her cleaning job, she said it was their fault for not teaching her how to clean properly). She started to trashtalk her friends for living the life she wished she could have (she doesn't have an education and has been fired from every job she landed, so she's been in and out of jobs these past 3 years) the worst of all is how she treats her boyfriend (the man i mentioned earlier) she is giving him the cold shoulder whenever he does something she doesn't like (and I mean, it's stuff like not giving her attention for 2 minutes because he is in the middle of a conversation with another) she has convinced him to share his destination at alle times so she knows where he is every second of the day, and if he is somewhere she's never seen or he haven't mentioned before she calls him right away asking him what he's doing and why he's there... 

I've been trying to tell her that it's not okay, and I know I shouldn't get involved, but I really care for my sisters wellbeing and it hurts me to listen to all her complaints and how unfair life is for her.
Now fastforword, this happened about a month ago.

Me and My boyfriend are planing on having a child, and we've been discussing names and we came up with 2 names we really like (one girl name and one boy name)

I tell my sister this and I told her how happy I was that my boyfriend agreed to the (boy name) because I've always wanted a boy with that name. She says it's a beautiful name and starts to talk about something else.

2 weeks ago me and my mother's side of the family were invited for Easter. (My boyfriend stayed with his parents) Everything was fine when suddenly my sister says (very loud) ""me and my boyfriend has discussed some baby names for when we want to have kids and we've decided to go with (boy name)""....

She said the boy name I wanted for my child, and I was so frustrated I had to leave for a few minutes. (It's not new she wants the same things as me, she's been like that since she was little, and I should have known better) and it really broke my heart because now everyone would think I stole the name (if I were to birth a boy). When I got home and told my boyfriend about it he was furious, but told me there was nothing we could do. 

That was the last straw, my sister is in a constant competition with me, she can't handle that I'm living a good life with my boyfriend, she says she want the same relationship as me, she wants the same hobbies, she thinks my friends are her friends too, and my parents did nothing during our childhood to prevent it. I think she's gone too far this time and I told her I could never trust her again and she began to cry, saying she was sorry for what she did, but I know those were fake tears (she manipulates a lot to get what she wants) and I stood my ground and told her I would no longer share anything of importance with her again.

Now my parents want me to say sorry for being dramatic over such a small thing... (and no I won't say sorry to her)

Unsure what to do next,"I matched with a girl on Bumble, and we quickly clicked. She said she was looking for a connection, which aligned with what I wanted. We exchanged Instagrams and started talking, she kept mentioning that I'm cute and sweet multiple times. She invited me out a couple of times, but I couldn’t make it.  She says she is too comfortable with me. We talk about literally everything she even esclates the chat to talk about sexual fantasies and how we will have sex in the car when we meet

We keep talking over phone or text for hours everyday. She even mentions she has already started falling for me. She book movie tickets for friday and after learning im not availble she again books it for Sunday. She mentioned that she has never done movie on a first date. I also dtart getting interested and we meet on Friday evening for coffee. We had a good time, and the next day, we had a long make-out session during a night drive. On sunday we went to watch the movie. 

After that, I felt her interest started to fade a bit, but she opened up more and shared personal things so i thought its just me overthinking. She calls me in the night discuss about an issue with their parents and how its draining her. The next two days are again choppy.

A couple of days later, she dumped me with a message saying she’s dealing with family issues and work stress, and isn’t emotionally available right now. She suggested staying friends for now. 

I’m unsure whether to move on or reach out to understand what went wrong, as I feel we had something genuine. Also should I be friends with her? Its been a week after the text and she has not made any attempts to contact me. 

What can I learn from this relationship that will help me handle the next one better ?

I'm trying to diagnose a De'Longhi Magnifica S for a colleague. If I can fix the machine it will be donated to our workplace, so I have an incentive to fix this machine haha. 

The problem is that when trying to make coffee there is no flow. We hear the pump but it sounds like it's maxing out or something and turns pretty quiet. There is no coffee flow. 
When flushing the machine a few times with the flush button flow returns! I have flow if there are no coffee grounds in the brew chamber. But then again when grinding and brewing... No flow. 

Yes I descaled multiple times and completely cleaned the brew group. I also opened up the machine and as far as I can tell most of the water lines are not completely scaled up. I removed a few and they look accessible.

I think the pump is suspicious. Although it pumps, I don't know how much pressure it generates. Don't know how to test this. 

The other part is the brewing area that is not accessible by default. Even with removing the top and side covers there is a brewing ""area"" that is still not exposed. Could this be completely clogged or something?

Before really taking every screw and line apart I'd like to know your thoughts. If it's common that the pump fails for example that saves me a lot of time not tearing down the rest of the machine.

1kc226t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMechanics/comments/1kc226t/cylinder_1_misfire/,Cylinder 1 misfire,"My car is Honda Civic 2012.

A month ago, I was driving about 30 minutes in the morning. As I parked my car for a coffee, the car was suddenly shaking violently after I came back for the coffee and turned it on. Then there was a CEL showing after a minute. I scanned the code using my OBD2 scanner and it showed P0301 cylinder 1 misfire.

I drove to a shop nearby and the mechanic said let’s replace 4 new sparks and one new coil on cylinder 1. I agreed and they proceeded replacement. It was fine until two weeks later.

It was suddenly shaking violently again after an idle of 30-45 minutes as I was waiting for a folk. I scanned my car with my own scanner again and it showed the same P0301 cylinder 1 misfire.

Knowing last time the shop only replaced one coil, I bought a new set of 4 new Denso coil as a prep for any event. I replaced all 4 including the new one that the shop did. As I turned it back on, the car was still shaking. I tried to erase the code but the scanner failed me. I was like let me unplug the battery to reset everything. I did that and the car was quiet down. No more CEL was shown. I proceeded my day as usual.

Now, so far after a month in total, there was no CEL shown. There was no shaking violently.

However I feel some small vibration in my drive seat during idling.  I opened the hood and I can feel some small vibration in the engine cover. My friends say either the fuel injectors fail or I got lots of carbon deposits in the entire fuel system. He suggested to run a couple of course of BG44K or Redline before replacing the fuel injectors.

I also noticed the OBD2 scanner showing the  EGR command is 0, and EGR error is 99.2. It shows the live data during idle. I suspect the EGR valve is either stuck or needs cleaning, which is causing the small vibration. 


What do you guys think? Any idea what to troubleshoot and resolve my car problem?
