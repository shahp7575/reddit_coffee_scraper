1qof6yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1qof6yb/most_job_search_advice_is_outdated_and_thats_why/,Most job search advice is outdated and that’s why people are stuck.,"I’m probably going to get downvoted for this, but most of the job search advice floating around the internet is straight-up outdated.

“Tailor your resume for every role.”
“Apply to 10–20 jobs a day.”
“Just network harder.”
“Trust the process.”

That advice might have worked 5–10 years ago. Today? It mostly just burns people out.

I followed all of it. Religiously. Customized resumes. ATS scanners. Cold LinkedIn DMs. Coffee chats. Follow-ups. More follow-ups. Hundreds(if not thousands) of applications later, silence. Ghosting. Rejections that came months late (if they came at all).

At some point, I realized the problem wasn’t effort.
It was that everyone is following the same playbook in a market that no longer rewards it.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth no one wants to say out loud: Hiring doesn’t happen in the places job advice tells you to focus on. Recruiters aren’t carefully reviewing your perfectly tailored resume. Hiring managers aren’t impressed that you applied within 24 hours. And no, your 3rd-degree connection does not want to “hop on a quick call.”

Most roles are filled through:
- internal shortlists
- referrals before the job goes public
- hiring people they already trust/have seen work
- candidates who show proof, not keywords

But job advice keeps pushing mass applications and fake personalization because it sounds productive.

It’s the same reason LinkedIn advice feels performative. Everyone is posting what they think they’re supposed to say, not what actually works.

Once I stopped treating job search like a numbers game and started treating it like a visibility + proof problem, things finally changed.
- Less applying.
- More targeted outreach.
- More showing my work instead of begging for opportunities.

Job searching isn’t broken because you’re lazy or “not trying hard enough.” It’s broken because most advice hasn’t caught up with how hiring actually works now.

Curious if others here hit the same wall. ",1,1769523777.0,jobsearchhacks,0,1.0,False

So we were just chilling with friends, normal bakchodi. Light teasing chal rahi thi between me and this girl, nothing serious.

She said something; mazak mazak mein I pulled her hair (rookie mistake, I know). She got fake-angry and did that “I’ll hit you but not really” move.

Now any sane person would step back, right?
No.
I jumped forward like a complete idiot.

And yeah… it connected. 😭

For a few seconds my brain stopped working. Legs went weak. Eyes got watery. Friends laughing. Me standing there questioning my entire existence.
Still didn’t cry though, because I'm an egoistic bitch 🤡

She immediately felt guilty and fed me sandwiches and coffee like I was in ICU 🥪☕. I kept saying “it’s fine” while internally fighting for survival and doing fertility math.

Moral of the story:
• Never pull hair
• Never underestimate “acting”
• Ego is temporary; pain is eternal

Pray for me 🙏
Also yes, she’s banned from near my personal space now.

1qof2q2,https://v.redd.it/t6w6oy0scwfg1,"Creating our first app, helping parents with the bedtime battle","In 2018 I made a coffee table book around inspiring families with children age 4-12 to ditch the screen more and go on little adventures into nature. It was launched in Belgium and the Netherlands, and we've made a spinoff in Slovakia as well. It started a bit of a movement, with it's own hashtag and over 6000 people posted photos of their epic outdoor family adventures. 

Screens got louder since, and especially during bedtime it turns out to be rather problematic. Bedtime, homework and screen time are the top 3 parenting frustrations nowadays. 

After some research and diving into a lot of scientific research papers around bedtime and screen time, it's safe to say that:

\- A lot of children are too wired from screens to go to bed easily  
\- Parents are too fried from their busy days to deal with that

Result: bedtime is often the most challenging part of the day, parents feel guilty and the whole situation erodes the relationship between parents and children. 

So we went to work. Building an app that assists parents with this challenge.

How?  
By creating bedtime tales, where the child is the main character. The stories are built around the child's real world; their companions, their feelings, designed to help them wind down (without requiring the two last functional brain cells you have left for the day).

You can choose to read it yourself or have a gentle voice narrate it for you. 

The concept is audio only, meaning there's no visuals for the child, besides what shows up in their own imagination. A calming ambient soundscape will play in the background as well. 

After the story, optional prompts help kids process their day. This is where they are most receptive, so it's a powerful moment to connect. 

We're going live in a 5 weeks. We got over 50 on the waitlist. Had a small crowd testing the prototype and first kiddos were raving about it and really couldn't believe they were part of the story.

1qof13j,https://i.redd.it/8zbhrgcxgwfg1.png,JAWA 42 guy rode HONDA CB350RS [Initial Impression],"TLDR? I fell in love 🤍



P.S. I am 5""11 and weigh around 69kg and my friend is 5""10 and weigh around 108kg. 



Me and my friend have been discussing about bikes since a couple of months without any plan to buy any bike in the near future. We planned to visit every showroom in the city just for fun and test ride different vehicles. We went to Honda, Yamaha and RE showroom today

I have only ridden Jawa 42(294CC) and Suzuki Gixxer (155CC) in my life. I have ridden the Jawa 42 for a long time so I know how the bike feels however I had no reference point as to how a refined engine should feel/perform. I have always been curious to test the Honda 350 lineup because everyone speaks highly about it......



We entered the showroom, got a cup of coffee, roamed around, filled the declaration and walked out with the sales representative who gave us the key. We decided that my friend would drive first then we would switch. 



What I INITIALLY THOUGHT would happen:

Jawa 42 produces around \~27NM torque and \~27bhp power so I was under the impression that the CB350RS would feel underwhelming in terms of power. I was also expecting good exhaust sound and okayish build quality(considering the price). I also heard people complain about tall gearing so I was mentally prepared for that.  


What ACTUALLY happened: 

The engine started and my friend revved, the first thing I remember was that FREAKING SOUND. A 350CC engine sounding like that?? First gear and the bike pulled so effortlessly but I noticed that the pillion comfort isn't the best in class. After a few minutes we switched, and here begins my actual review......



I thought I would stall the engine(because I always do) but it pulled like a scooty(a powerful one). Do you remember my friend's weight?(108 kg) so it takes some effort for me to balance and pull from the first gear. On the honda it was butter smooth, I shifted to second gear a little too soon and I thought it would start knocking(Jawa problem) but to my surprise it pulled without a problem, I did it again with the third gear and opened the throttle expecting it to take some time to pull as it's 6-7 bhp less than Jawa. DIDN'T BREAK A SWEAT. All this dopamine rush while the exhaust is playing a melody in the background. 



The bike never felt heavy, I took a u-turn and was very surprised how easy it was, all this while carrying my 108kg friend. The front brake felt bad(maybe the test bike wasn't maintained properly), the pillion comfort was decent to okayish. But I went to test the bike with keeping the engine in mind and oh boy I came back home with my Jaw dropped on Jawa's tank. 



Now I have experienced both ends of the spectrum, from the worst to the best in segment

Disclaimer: No AI is used in writing this post or correcting any grammar. Apologies for any mistakes. Crafting this post right after coming from the showroom so my opinions might be biased or affected by dopamine

Its nice but people can be a little too in each others business sometimes.

Behind our house theres a shared lot where people store stuff in garages. Lately some neighbors have been clearing things out and organizing old wood and random junk.

This morning we were having coffee in the kitchen and heard banging outside. Looked out the window and saw someone literally throwing pieces of an old wooden bed frame over our fence into our yard. Hardware still attached and everything. We also noticed a bunch of heavy wooden doors leaning against our fence which we just replaced last summer.

I was pissed AND Didnt even think about it. Just went outside and started throwing the wood back over the fence. Didnt say anything just tossed it.

Right as I finished I heard a woman on the other side go oh no wait those are for Jenny is this Jennys yard.
I told her no Jenny lives next door. And also we dont want those doors leaning against our fence we just had it replaced.

She started to explain like she had no other choice but then stopped herself and dropped it. I wasnt yelling but I was clearly annoyed.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

**Episode 4: The Spider of Glass and the Prisoners of Excel**

(Author's Note: If you have a fear of heights... hold onto your chair. Masa has no such weakness.)

The mark on my forearm burned cold this morning. The ink had shifted, the characters reforming themselves like sand in a storm. Ninety-seven.

Time is a relentless archer, and I am the target.

I sat in seiza in the center of the Lady Aoi’s fortress—a cramped chamber she calls a ""1DK""—and meditated. My ""Focus Visor"" (the broken plastic eye-guards she calls VR goggles) rested upon my forehead. I needed clarity. The air in this era is thick with invisible signals and the noise of iron beasts.

""Masa,"" Lady Aoi said, her voice devoid of spirit.

I opened one eye. She was slumped over the low table, her face pressed into a sheet of paper marked with red ink.

""Speak, my Lady. Has the enemy breached the perimeter?""

""Worse,"" she groaned, lifting her head. Her eyes were dark circles of fatigue. ""Rent is due in three days. And thanks to your 'acrobatics' destroying that Uber Eats order yesterday, my rating tanked. We are broke, Masa. Destitute. We are going to be living in a cardboard box under the bridge.""

I frowned. ""A strategic relocation to a defensible position under a bridge? The Fuma clan often used riverbeds for ambush tactics. It is not a shameful dwelling.""

""It is shameful for a twenty-year-old college student!"" she snapped. She slammed a hand on the table. ""I found a gig. It pays cash. High risk, high reward. It’s manual labor, so they won't ask for your ID or why you speak like a samurai drama character.""

I stood, adjusting my kimono (which was actually a frayed bathrobe I had appropriated). ""I am a shadow. Labor is my breathing. Command me.""

""Window cleaning,"" she said, a wicked glint in her eye. ""High-rise.""

\*\*\*

The structure was an abomination against nature.

We stood at the base of a tower of glass and steel in the district of Shinjuku. It pierced the heavens, vanishing into the smog-laden clouds. In my time, only the Gods dared to live this high. To build such a thing is hubris; to scale it is madness.

""Fifty stories,"" Aoi said, looking up, her face pale. She adjusted the straps of her jumpsuit. ""We have to clean the exterior windows from the 30th floor down to the 10th. The regular crew got food poisoning.""

We were led to a metal cage suspended by thin, twisting wires. The ""Gondola.""

I inspected the wire. It was thin. Fragile. Trusting one's life to a thread spun by a machine? Foolish. A ninja trusts only his own grip.

""Get in, Masa,"" Aoi said, her legs trembling as she stepped onto the swaying platform.

""This basket is a coffin,"" I stated flatly.

""It's OSHA compliant! Just get in and put on the harness!""

I stepped in. The basket groaned. I did not like the groan. It sounded like a dying horse.

As the machine whirred and lifted us into the sky, the people below shrank into ants. The wind began to howl. Aoi clung to the railing, her eyes shut tight, mumbling prayers to deities of currency.

I, however, felt the call of the void.

When we reached the 30th floor, the wind was fierce. The basket swayed violently.

""Okay,"" Aoi squeaked, handing me a T-shaped tool and a bucket of blue water. ""You do the left side. I'll do the right. Just... wipe it. Don't do anything weird.""

""I shall purify the surface,"" I promised.

I dipped the tool. But as I leaned out, the basket lurched. Aoi screamed.

Unacceptable. This instability would compromise the mission.

I silently channeled my chakra into my feet—or rather, I utilized the secret Iga-ryu technique of 'Crushing Grip.' I climbed over the railing of the basket.

""Masa! What are you doing?!"" Aoi shrieked, the wind tearing her words away.

""The basket is treacherous!"" I shouted back. ""I shall proceed as the spider does!""

I pressed my tabi-covered feet against the metal window frame, wedging my toes into the millimeter-wide gaps, and gripped the glass with my fingertips. To the untrained eye, I was defying gravity. To a shinobi, I was merely understanding friction.

I hung there, fifty meters above the earth, safe and stable.

""Get back in the boat! You'll die!""

""Focus on your task, Lady Aoi! I am secure!""

I began to wipe. Wax on. Wax off. The motion was fluid. Efficient. The glass became invisible under my hand.

And then, I looked inside.

I froze.

Through the pristine glass of the 30th floor, I witnessed a scene of horror that chilled my warrior’s blood.

The room was vast, stretching endlessly. It was filled with rows of identical desks, arranged like tombstones in a mass grave. At each desk sat a person—men and women in identical dark armor (suits).

They were silent. They did not move. Their postures were slumped, their spines curved like willow branches in a gale.

But it was their eyes that terrified me.

They stared into glowing square slates—Luminous Tablets—that emitted a harsh, soul-draining white light. Their fingers moved across small boards with a frantic, clicking rhythm, like the chattering of teeth in winter. Click-click-click-click.

""By the Buddha..."" I whispered.

They were trapped.

I saw a man near the window. His skin was the color of old ash. His eyes were red-rimmed, devoid of the spark of life. On his glowing slate, endless grids of numbers and green lines confined him. A prison of logic. A dungeon of mathematics.

It is a Genjutsu, I realized with a jolt of nausea. A sorcery of the mind.

These were not free citizens. They were prisoners of war, captured by a cruel warlord, forced to transcribe cursed scriptures for eternity. The glowing boxes were feeding on their Ki, draining their life force drop by drop to power this Tower of Babel.

""Masa! Why did you stop?"" Aoi yelled from the basket.

""Hush, woman!"" I hissed, clinging to the window frame upside down. ""Do you not see them? The Damned?""

I looked back at the man near the window. His head was drooping. He was fading. The Genjutsu was consuming the last of his spirit. He was going to die right here, in this invisible cage.

I could not save them all. I am but one man, and I am a dropout. But I could not let a warrior perish before my eyes.

I shimmied down the glass until I was face-to-face with him. I was upside down, my Focus Visor dangling from my forehead.

I raised my hand and tapped on the thick glass.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

The man did not react. The spell was too deep.

I tapped harder with the handle of my squeegee. THUD. THUD.

The man’s head jerked up.

He looked at the window. He saw a man in a bathrobe, hanging upside down at 300 feet, wearing broken VR goggles, staring at him with the intensity of a demon.

His eyes went wide. His jaw dropped.

""FIGHT IT!"" I roared, though the glass muffled my voice. I gathered my fingers into the Kuji-in seals.

I flashed the signs rapidly.

Rin! (Strength)

Pyo! (Direction)

Toh! (Harmony)

""Do not yield to the glowing box, Warrior of the Office!"" I shouted, pressing my hand against the glass. ""The numbers are an illusion! Your soul belongs to the sky! WAKE UP!""

The man screamed. I could not hear it, but I saw his mouth form the shape of a primal shriek. He fell backward out of his chair, scrambling away on his hands and knees, knocking over a stack of papers.

Other prisoners turned. The spell was breaking! The sudden commotion shattered the silence of the dungeon.

The man was breathing heavily, clutching his chest. He looked at me, terror and confusion warring in his eyes. But he was awake. The dead look was gone, replaced by pure, adrenaline-fueled fear.

I nodded solemn approval. Live, warrior. Live to fight another day.

""Masa! The supervisor is looking up! We have to move!"" Aoi cried out.

I pushed off the frame, swinging back toward the basket in a graceful arc. ""My work here is done. I have disrupted the enemy's concentration.""

We descended rapidly. I cleaned with the fury of a typhoon, wiping away grime and despair in equal measure.

\*\*\*

When we reached the ground, Aoi collapsed onto the pavement, kissing the concrete. ""Never again. Never, ever again.""

The foreman walked over, checking a clipboard. He looked at the gleaming windows above. ""Fast work. And... uh... did you guys see anything on the 30th floor? Someone called security saying a 'Sky Demon' was trying to steal their soul?""

Aoi froze. She looked at me.

I crossed my arms. ""The spirits of this valley are restless. I merely offered a prayer.""

The foreman blinked. Then he shrugged. ""Whatever. Windows are clean. Here's the cash.""

He handed Aoi an envelope. She snatched it, the color returning to her face instantly.

""We eat tonight!"" she cheered, all trauma forgotten. ""Masa, you're crazy, but you're profitable.""

As we walked away from the tower, I looked back. High up, on the 30th floor, I imagined the warrior I had saved. Perhaps he had fled the dungeon. Perhaps my visage had frightened him into a new life.

""The modern world is a cruel battlefield, Aoi-dono,"" I said quietly.

""Huh?"" She was busy counting bills.

""Those men in the tower. They bleed without being cut. They die without falling. I would rather face a thousand spearmen than endure one day in that glowing prison.""

Aoi stopped. She looked at the tower, then at the money in her hand, and gave a small, weary smile.

""Yeah,"" she said softly. ""That's why they call it the daily grind, Masa. Come on. Let's go buy some premium pork for the hotpot.""

I nodded. The countdown on my arm was hidden beneath my sleeve, but I could feel it ticking.

But what if the secret to finally focusing wasn't more coffee, but something completely unexpected?
Turns out, a little bit of controlled chaos can actually bring the calm you've been searching for.
The library used to be my enemy. So many books, so little time.  Exams were always looming, and I felt like I was drowning.  Late nights felt like a losing battle.  I’d stare at my notes, but my mind would wander.

One night, scrolling aimlessly, I found this one online and it actually worked. It was a Halloween mask. I just clicked because the pictures were so wild. I wasn’t even looking for anything, just trying to forget about my problems for a minute.

The next day, I put it on. It was a mistake. I thought it would just be silly. But when I put it on, something shifted. The noise in my head went quiet. It was like the mask created its own little world.

Now, it's my secret weapon. When I need to focus, I put it on for a bit. It helps me reset. It’s weird, but it works. I can get through my studying so much better.

If you’ve ever felt completely overwhelmed by work or just life, I get it. It's hard to find your calm. I found this mask at ursupermart.com and it genuinely makes a difference for me. It’s not what you’d expect, but sometimes the unexpected is exactly what you need.",1,1769522909.0,MobilCarTech,0,1.0,False

1qoes52,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortHorrorStoriesWeb/comments/1qoes52/sixteen_minutes_past_six/,Sixteen Minutes Past Six,"I keep checking the clock like it’s going to surprise me.

Sixteen minutes past six. Then seventeen. Then seventeen again, because the second hand seems to stick when I stare too hard. I tell myself to stop hovering, to breathe, to enjoy the quiet while it lasts. Tonight matters. Tonight is supposed to feel normal again.

Evan will be home in two hours.

Two whole hours until my husband walks through the door, drops his keys in the bowl by the entryway, and smiles that tired, crooked smile he gets when he’s been working too much but doesn’t want to admit it. I haven’t seen him properly in days. Not really. He’s been leaving before dawn and coming back after midnight, all hushed voices and apologies and quick kisses to my forehead while I pretend to stay asleep.

He says it’s temporary. Just until the quarter ends. Just until the project launches. Just until his supervisor notices how indispensable he is.

I believe him. I have to.

\_\_

Jack fusses softly from the baby monitor, a thin sound like a kitten stuck behind a wall. I head upstairs, scooping him from his crib before he can escalate into a real cry. He smells like powder and milk and that indefinable warm sweetness that makes my chest ache.

“Hey, bug,” I whisper, rocking him. “Mama’s got you.”

He settles against me, heavy-lidded and trusting. Six months old today. Or yesterday. I’m not entirely sure. The days blur together lately, measured less by calendars than by feedings and naps and the slow crawl of exhaustion.

I lay him back down after a few minutes, smoothing his hair with my thumb. He doesn’t stir when I leave the room, which feels like a small victory.

\_\_

Downstairs, the house looks… fine. Normal. A little messy, sure. A stack of clean laundry waiting to be folded on the couch. A smear of something sticky on the coffee table. Toys scattered like landmines across the rug. Evidence of a life being lived.

I preheat the oven and set the chicken on the counter. Evan’s favorite. Rosemary, lemon, garlic. Comfort food. Food that says I see you, I missed you, I’m still trying.

As I work, I narrate to myself without realizing it. Salt. Pepper. Wash hands. Don’t forget to turn the oven light on—Evan likes to peek in and comment on how good it smells. I smile at the thought.

\_\_

I catch my reflection in the microwave door and flinch.

God, I look wrecked.

Dark crescents under my eyes, skin dull despite the moisturizer I slather on every morning with optimism I don’t feel. My hair is clean, at least, though it falls limp around my shoulders no matter what I do to it. I can hear Evan’s voice in my head—you’re beautiful, you know that—and I almost believe it.

Almost.

\_\_

I shove the chicken into the oven and set the timer. The click of it is reassuring. Something is officially in motion. Dinner is happening. Tonight is happening.

I check the baby monitor again. Jack sleeps, chest rising and falling in that way that still makes me watch too long, counting breaths just to be safe.

I pour Evan a drink—just a finger of whiskey, like he likes—and leave it on the counter with a single ice cube floating lazily. I don’t pour myself one. I haven’t had a drink since before Jack was born. The thought of alcohol on top of this level of fatigue feels dangerous, like leaning over a balcony railing just to see how far the drop is.

Instead, I make coffee. Even as I pour it, I think, this is a bad idea. I’ve already had too much today. My hands tremble slightly as I lift the mug. Still, I drink it. I need to be present. I need to be awake when Evan gets home.

\_\_

I go upstairs to change.

The dress I pick is navy blue, soft, forgiving in the places I need it to be. It hides the worst of the stretch marks and the lingering softness around my middle. I spritz perfume at my wrists and neck, the scent familiar and comforting. Evan bought it for me years ago, back when “date night” meant staying out too late and sleeping in the next day.

I pause in the hallway, listening.

The house hums quietly. Refrigerator. Furnace. The distant rush of cars outside. No crying from the baby monitor.

Good.

\_\_

I check the clock again. Forty-two minutes have passed. Or maybe twenty. Time feels unreliable, like it’s bending just out of sight.

I go back downstairs.

The smell of roasting chicken fills the kitchen now, rich and savory. I pull vegetables from the fridge and start chopping, careful and methodical. My knife thumps rhythmically against the cutting board. I focus on the sound, the repetition. It keeps me anchored.

\_\_

That’s when I hear the key in the door.

I startle so hard I nearly drop the knife.

Already?

I glance at the clock. No. That can’t be right. There’s still—

The lock turns. The door opens.

“Evan?” I call, my voice already lifting with relief.

\_\_

He steps inside, shrugging out of his coat. He looks thinner than I remember. Sharper around the edges. His eyes flick to the counter, the drink waiting for him.

“Hey,” he says, smiling.

The sound of his voice hits me like a wave. Warm. Familiar. Real.

“You’re early,” I laugh, rushing to him. I press the glass into his hand before he can say anything, lean up to kiss him. He tastes like cold air and peppermint gum.

“Something smells incredible,” he says, kissing me back.

“I made your favorite,” I say, grinning like an idiot.

He chuckles, loosening his tie. “I figured. You always do when you’re trying to spoil me.”

“Well, you deserve it.”

\_\_

He wanders toward the living room, then the hallway. Toward the stairs.

“And where’s my guy?” he calls. “Did I miss bedtime?”

“He’s asleep,” I say. “He was fussy earlier, but he went down okay.”

Evan nods, already halfway up the stairs. “I’ll just peek.”

I follow him, still talking about dinner, about how good Jack’s nap schedule’s been, about nothing important at all. The normal things. The things we say when everything is fine.

\_\_

He stops abruptly in the doorway to the nursery.

I almost run into him.

“Babe,” he says slowly, “why is there a chicken in the crib?”

I laugh. A sharp, startled sound. “What? Don’t be ridiculous.”

He doesn’t laugh back.

He stares into the room, frozen.

\_\_

I step around him, irritation flaring. “The chicken’s in the oven, Evan. I literally just—”

I stop.

The crib is empty.

No. That’s not right.

I step closer. My heart begins to hammer. The mattress is bare. No baby. No blankets. No Jack.

“That’s not funny,” I say, my voice thin.

\_\_

Evan turns to look at me. His expression isn’t confused. It’s careful. Concerned in a way that makes my skin prickle.

“Where’s Jack?” he asks.

“He was—” I swallow. “He was sleeping. I just checked on him.”

“When?”

“Just now. Earlier. I don’t—”

The baby monitor on the dresser is dark. Unplugged.

I don’t remember unplugging it.

\_\_

“I put him in here,” I insist, even as doubt claws at the edges of my mind. “I rocked him. He fell asleep on my shoulder. I laid him down.”

Evan’s jaw tightens. “Honey.”

“I didn’t move him,” I say, louder now. “Why would I move him?”

“Okay,” he says gently. “Okay. Let’s just slow down.”

Something in his tone snaps a thread inside me.

\_\_

“Where is he?” I demand.

Evan doesn’t answer.

He just looks past me, down the hall.

I turn.

The smell hits me first.

Roasted chicken. Stronger than before. Almost overpowering.

The oven timer goes off downstairs.

We stare at each other.

\_\_

“No,” I whisper.

Evan moves before I do, pushing past me, taking the stairs two at a time. I follow, my legs weak, my thoughts skidding wildly. This doesn’t make sense. It can’t. I would know. I would remember.

Wouldn’t I?

The kitchen is filled with smoke.

The oven door hangs open.

Inside, on the rack, is the roasting pan.

Inside the pan—

I scream.

\_\_

Evan grabs me as my knees give out, my scream tearing out of me again and again, raw and animal and endless. He pulls me away, but I can’t stop looking. I can’t stop seeing.

Too small.

God, it’s too small.

I don’t remember putting him in there.

I don’t remember opening the crib again.

I don’t remember anything after the coffee.

The house smells like rosemary and lemon and something else underneath it all. Something burnt. Something final.

\_\_

Evan is shouting my name, his voice breaking, but it sounds far away. Like it’s coming from another house. Another life.

The last thing I see before everything goes dark is the mug on the counter.

My mug.

Cold now.

Fast Sinking Streamers

""Aren't there any good sculpin patterns that don't have the deer hair head,"" I asked? ""You bet,"" said George Kelly. ""I've got one I call the Foxy Lady and I really believe in it. Come over here, I want to show you something."" I was talking to George Kelly in the showroom of the former Beaver Pond sports center in Bozeman, Montana. The Beaver Pond had a big fiberglass fish tank near the front entrance of the store that was stocked with an impressive menagerie of wild Montana fish. There were several good sized rainbows, a grayling, a pair of whitefish and a mean looking twenty-four or twenty-fiver inch brown trout that was the undisputed heavyweight champion of the tank. George was grinning at me and beckoning me over toward the tank. ""Look at this, "" he said.
 George's fly was a yellow-bellied, fuzzy-hackled thing with a long sensuous strip off fox fur tied over the back. It was the spring of 1976 and I had never seen a fur-strip streamer before. It looked pretty wild. I watched closely as he tied the Foxy Lady onto a short length of leader and tossed it into a froth of air bubbles on the far side of the tank. ""Look at that fox fur move,"" said George. ""I'm absolutely convinced that action just drives'em wild. And without the deer hair head, it's easier to sink than a Muddler.""


George was and sill is one of the best river guides her in Montana, and I was impressed. I was just about to say something about the sexy, undulating action of the fox fur when the big brown trout darted out from his sanctuary under the air bubbles and swirled on the Foxy lady like an angry shark. He didn't actually bite the fly, but he swatted it hard with his tail, knocking the fly clear out of the tank. The Foxy Lady landed with a wet splat on the aquamarine rim of the fish tank about a foot away from where I was standing.

It was too much for me. I bought two or three patches of fox fur, tied up a new arsenal of Foxy Ladies and headed off on a a ten year binge of fur-strip streamer fishing I am just now starting to see from a different perspective. I like streamer fishing. It's a quick, fast-paced form of fly fishing that suites my impatient temperament. And I like the larger class of fish you catch with streamers. But after ten years of trying I have to admit it: fur-strip steamers may be a little easier to sink than Muddlers, but not much easier. I still think the pulsing, rippling action of a fur-strip fly is an important piscatorial eye catcher, but more important than action I now believe, is
how deep you fish a streamer fly and how quickly you get it there.

Thick matted strips of fur aren't actually buoyant, they way deer hair Muddlers are, but they still aren't very easy to sink. The soft flexible action of thousands of undulating fur fibers creates a great deal of turbulence or ""hydrodynamic drag"" that, like a miniature sea anchor, slows down and deadens the overall movement of the fly. If you've ever tried to dry out a pair of wet blue jeans by holding them out the window of your car while zooming down the highway you'll know what I'm talking about. To design a steamer fly that really sinks well, it turns out you have to avoid turbulence as well as buoyancy. The deepest diving, quickest sinking flies I've been able to make so afar have all been made with a few sparse feathers and with slick, slippery synthetic fibers. The slippery nature of plastic is the main reason it sinks so well. Just like the highly polished bottom of a surfboard or a fiberglass racing boat, slick plastic creates very little hydrodynamic drag.

Epilog

I remember an early March trip over to Livingston to fish the O'Hair stretch of Armstrong spring creek. Snow flies--or midges--and a generic assortment of small nymphs are the standard winter flies here in Montana. But the winter was unusually mild that year and the warm, window spring weather had come several weeks ahead of schedule. The rainbows wouldn't actually be spawning for another month or so, but we thought we might catch a few on egg flies anyway. What the hell. After surviving another Montana winter the first fishing trip of the
year is a celebration--the fishing doesn't have to be good.

My father my wife Adele and our family doctor Doug and I packed up a cooler full of sandwiches and coffee and headed over the Bozeman pass toward Livingston late that morning. By the time we had paid our rod fees rigged up our rods an slipped into our waders the wind was really starting blow. I rigged up a with a rod with a pair of Copper Nymphs and headed down to the warming shed to wait for the others. I found a subdued and wind-weary Victor Colvard sitting at one of the picnic tables. Victor was holding his hat on his head with one hand while working on a steaming cup of coffee with the other. Victor is a fishing guide, a connoisseur of wooden riverboats and one of Montana's most notorious fishing bums. He wasn't encouraging.

""We've been here since about nine,"" Victor said, with a squinting, stickey-eyed look. ""We've caught a few,"" he said. ""But you really have to work for them."" ""Try any egg patterns,"" I asked? ""Not me,"" said Victor. ""I never use'em. At least not in public. This wind is too much for me,"" he added. ""I think we'll head over to Fort Smith tomorrow and give the banana belt (the Big Horn) at try.""
""Well good luck,"" I said.

The wind was grim. It was pulling so hard on your line you couldn't feel a strike even if you got one. To see a fish strike seemed like the only chance to actually hook one. I heard Doug bellowing from way upstream. He was up above the wooden bridge, past the lambing sheds, yelling for the rest of us to join him at the source pool, where the spring water bubbles up out of the ground and cascades over a swampy embankment into a frothy spring creek pool. Doug had spotted a big fish finning in an eddy at the edge of the foam on the far side of the pool. And he wanted Adele to have a first crack at the fish. It was a nice gesture.

Adele waded out about two steps into the creek and started false casting a Copper Nymph in the general direction of the big fish. It was a tough cast because of thick willows at our backs, Adele finally got a good drift on her third or fourth cast. The big fish broke away from his holding spot and drifted slowly downstream a few feet to look at her fly. Then he bolted back upstream with a powerful flick of his tail. It looked like a big brown, but it was hard to tell. The low, late winter sun was peaking through the fast moving clouds and glancing off the water with a terrible glare. Adele soon tired of the hunt and Doug stepped in to take her place, drifting his fly past the big trout with a casting skill that can only come from years of experience.

The big trout held his ground. I got the feeling he was actually getting annoyed at this point. The big fish flexed the length of his body, like a slow moving snake, and casually moved over sideways two or three inches to avoid getting snagged on Doug's drifting nymph. ""That was a pretty conclusive rejection,"" Doug said. ""That fish has been around for a while,"" he added. Doug winked at Adele and looked at me with a conspiratorial grin. ""I think it's your turn now,"" he said while looking straight at me. ""And worms aren't allowed.""

With a feigned look of confidence, I quickly tied on a big Sockeye Shiner, raised my eyebrows, lowered my chin and looked over in Doug's direction. But I didn't say anything. My first cast missed its mark by a several feet. The wind was horrendous. I made another cast with a little more muscle on it and shot the shinny streamer all the way out to the edge of the froth, only inches away form where we had last seen the big fish. I mended my line, twitched the rod tip a few times and boom: the big brown trout shot darted out from underneath the foam and pounced on the Sockeye Shiner like Hulk Hogan in a tag team match at Madison Square Garden.

It was a street fight from the first moment. I hadn't come prepared to fish streamers...I had on a pretty light leader. I had to give him all the line he wanted. I pointed the rod at the fish and hoped for the best as he thrashed his head from side to side and drifted downstream. I never would have stopped him if he had continued on downstream, but he suddenly reversed himself and headed back upstream for the security of the foam at the head of the pool. He quickly tired and I gradually brought him to the net. He as no trophy, but he was a strong nineteen inches long and I never felt more victorious. It took a supreme effort on my part to hide my exicement. It was a long time before Doug said anything. I was stroking the fishes gills, getting ready to release him when Doug shook his head and,
with a wry expression said,

""You'll have to show me how to make those things when we get home!""

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Relationship Background: I (19F) don't have a super good relationship with my father (41M). We are both major gamers, so our relationship is slowly getting better. Mostly because we avoid talking about anything but games. 

  
My father got me a PS5 back in 2023 to help with post-surgery recovery and early birthday gift. My mom pays for my PS Plus when able. Because of this, I sometimes give out my login to family. I gave the login to my father (no one else has it besides me atm) a few months ago when has get a PS portal. He had it prior, but I changed the password due to a falling out we had over a year ago. 

Fast forward to yesterday, he asks for help to set up his PS5 with my info and I agree. He not only has me on speaker, which I didn't know about until after, but he also proceeds to loudly say my login info in a room full of children. One of said children previously spent hundreds on Roblox after getting his info. I decided to let this go and just removed my PayPal from my account.

The 2 rules I have is that: 1) You have to let me know if you are on/want to be on if using my account, so I don't get kicked off/kick you off. And 2) Children do Not get unsupervised access.

I asked him to put a pin on it and he kept refusing, saying that the kids don't have the account password so it's fine (? you said it out loud) and they won't mess with my progress at all. 

Less than 4 hours after giving him the info, I got kicked off a game and didn't save but thought it was just a glitch, so I tried to suck it up and play something else. I proceeded to get kicked off my game again because one of the children logged in on my account and he wasn't watching them/didn't stop them. It was Neon White and I was struggling a bit and was about to get a Sub 20 on a level in Chap 8.

I went to sleep upset and sent this text today: 

**So, I thought about it, and I would like it if you put a login pin on your PS for my account. Yall still have access to those games, and the children don't need access to my account. Because I downplayed it last night, but I was in the middle of a run and was going for a record with my best timing, and that completely destroyed my progress. That can't happen again, especially because some of the games I play don't have autosave/can't save between runs (Ender Lilies, Neon White, Hollow Night, etc.). It would be different if only you used it, but you aren't. All I ask is that you add a pin and don't tell anybody said pin. No one needs to know it but you.**

My father is a Parents-knows-best/Disrespect is what I say it is type and I feel bad for being rude, especially because he already said he didn't want to add a pin and maybe I'm being too overprotective of my stuff, but I don't know. I know this is minor and I know I sound like/am a pushover but I'm recovering from a surgery from June, still in pain, and tired of the problems and arguing.

So AITA for telling my father to put a pin on his PS5.

alright so i have started developing interest into relationships etc , now what i mean by that is...i wasn't really interested in relationships and all even after 2 years in college.

i got enough amount of proposals but since something else was going in my mind i wasn't really reacting to these things.

i met this girl in a competition (shes from my collge as well) she's pretty famous in clg , got a boyfriend as well and i knew it already. After 2 days into the competition we started talking and on that day itself, after the completion of our performance at night she started crying cuz of her poor performance i consolidated her by cracking jokes about other performers she giggled and was happy again.

When we were about to leave the backstage and going to the rooms she asked me to hold her hand as that dress was difficult to manage we walked for 10min and while walking there she started dumping her past (not trauma but more like whatever she did before college) and when we finally reached out rooms she asked  "" why am i telling all this to you"", i said ""idk?"" and left her hand and joined my boys group.

Later when we were on our way to back to our city (in college bus) she asked me to sit near her and again we started talking (she also asked for my shoulder so that she can rest her head on it) again we talked and did a fun convo.

TBH i was flattered till now

We met again in college after 2-3 days and she asked me if i can go with her for a coffee as she had no one to accompany her , we talked again and this time i told her about my previous relationship and how we broke-up (we broke-up on the day of competition itself and she knew it) she asked me if i was sad about the breakup but i said its okay its the part of the journey.

we met again after a week of this incident and while we were having our energy drinks which i bought her , she said ""why are you buying me these things ? do you like me?"" i was like FUCKKK!!! that's not how it was supposed to go. I said NO just to see her reaction and she was like if you do then keeping going i don't care. I asked why she started being rude to me ""must be my periods"" she said.

after this i stopped meeting her as i got clue what she was upto , she rang me few times on that day itself but i didn't respond .A month later she met me again irl (which i was trying to avoid) came to me shake my hand and i did a mistake of not leaving her hand and pulled her towards me and she was like ""woahh"" , we talked again and left

same day when i was playing volley with my friends she came to the court and started staring me , stared that much that even i was started getting nervous which made me rethink all of my life choices and what am i even doing in my life.

Any of you have a clue what should i do and what she's upto? I'm feeling off just cuz she had a boyf otherwise im good to go.",1,1769522023.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

For the last 6 or so months I've been experiencing weird symptoms that are hard to explain, on and off. The most prominent one is ectopic heartbeats (PVC) that has been ruled by two cardiologists as benign (phew). However, I still keep getting them, and sometimes hundreds upon hundreds a day. Sleep is also something that has been affected a lot, I struggle to sleep and stay asleep, even if I'm clearly tired. Not something that used to be an issue.

Another thing I've noticed is the feeling of slight nausea in the morning, plus somewhat loss of appetite , even though I haven't lost any significant weight. I also keep peeing a lot, maybe 12 times a day, and sometimes I wake up at night peeing 2-3 times, even though I've simply had a cup of coffee and some water during the day, I'm not exactly chugging liters here, so it's a bit strange. Weird fleeting body aches are also present. 

So eventually I was like, what's up? Surely this can't be the new norm, so I went to doc a couple of days ago and drew blood. All tests were fine, kidney numbers were good, but I had slightly elevated Hemoglobin (17.2 gl/dl) and high serum calcium (2.57 mmol/L / 10.3 mg/Dl). Magnesium was also a bit on the low side, but within reference range (0.79 mmol/L). Doc was pretty chill and basically concluded with everything is alright + maybe it's some anxiety going on. I'm not too sure about that anxiety theory, I feel it's a very easy blanket statement to present when nothing is alarmingly out of range. Personally, I feel pretty releaxed, but the recent symptoms obviously cause some anxiety and concern that something is out of whack. 

  
That's when I stumbled across this community and saw people's experience with high calcium, and it seems it's highly individual basically. What do you guys think? Is this something I should pursue further with doc, and if so, how should I angle it? She basically assumes this is anxiety and suggested beta blockers, but I'm not too keen...

The things i did-

\- As i was riding my bike i just visualised that tea/coffee would be ready(the ride was of 20 minutes)

\- I detached from the outcome, i accepted that the worst case scenario would be that i’ll have to make it, it’s not the end of the world

During this manifestation, i even had doubts, that what if it doesn’t happen, my belief from the law would shaken(even though i have manifested several things) but it didn’t matter because i didn’t leave the state where i received ready made coffee.

You're driving down some back road, windows down, and you see it. A scraggly piece of land. Overgrown. Forgotten. Maybe there's an old mobile home pad with pipes sticking out of the ground. Maybe it's just dirt and weeds and a half-dead tree.

Most people see nothing. I see a business.

Actually, I see about 40 of them. And today, I'm going to walk you through every single one. These aren't theoretical ideas I pulled from some business textbook. These are things I've either done myself, watched friends do, or discovered while building businesses on my own ""unwanted"" property outside Dallas-Fort Worth.

Here's the thing about land. One acre is 43,000 square feet. That's a lot of space to do absolutely nothing with. Or it's a lot of space to stack multiple income streams on top of each other until you've built something that actually cash flows.

Let's get after it.

# #40: Buying Land via a USDA Loan

Before we even talk about monetizing land, let's talk about acquiring it without draining your bank account.

If you live in the United States, you need to look into the USDA Rural Development Loan. This thing is criminally underutilized. No PMI. No mortgage insurance. And here's the kicker: if your property is in a qualifying rural area (there's a map online where you can check this), and your credit isn't terrible, you can qualify for zero percent down on a government-backed loan.

Zero. Percent. Down.

There are some restrictions. You can only use it on raw land if you plan to build something on it, whether that's a stick-built home, modular, or manufactured. There are income limits too. But the interest rates are even lower than FHA loans.

If you want raw land and never plan to put anything on it, this won't work. But if you're thinking about building a tiny home, a barndominium, or even just a manufactured home to rent out, this is how you get in the game without coming out of pocket for a massive down payment.

# #39: Tiny Home and Shed Sales or Construction

Here's a secret the tiny home industry doesn't want you to know.

Thanks to reality TV shows, the cost of purpose-built tiny homes has gotten outrageous. We're talking $50,000 to $80,000, easily over $100,000 in some cases. For what? Four walls, a foundation, and a roof.

Meanwhile, I paid $7,200 for a shed. Eight by eight feet. Delivered to my property. Then I spent about another grand getting it wired, throwing up some drywall, paint, furniture, fixtures. Add a loft up top, and you're all-in for maybe $20,000. That's a proper tiny home.

You can rent that out for $500 to $1,000 a month. Make your money back in a couple years. Buy a purpose-built tiny home, and you're not making your money back for a decade or more.

The difference? Framing. The seller positioned mine as a shed, which you generally can't monetize. But finish out the inside, and it's the same product. You can also get into the business of assembling or building sheds on site and selling them on Facebook Marketplace. There's a reason shed companies are everywhere. The demand is real.

# #38: Trailer Storage

Here's something I learned from listing stuff on Facebook Marketplace: the vast majority of demand isn't from individual homeowners who need to store one little trailer. It's from industrial companies and general contractors who have three flatbed trailers, four box trailers, maybe a cement truck. They've got equipment everywhere and nowhere to put it.

They prefer fenced land, which can be a bigger investment. But even without fencing, you can charge between $80 and $250 per month per spot. Remember, one acre is 43,000 square feet. Do the math on how many trailers and trucks you can fit. You can make six figures of income from truck and trailer parking alone.

There are websites that act like Airbnb for parking lots and truck parking. Use those to acquire customers instead of doing all the legwork yourself.

# #37: RV Pad Rental

You know that little 30-amp plug on the side of a building? That tiny electrical hookup has the ability to make more money than the entire structure it's attached to.

A 30-amp or 50-amp plug is all you need to host RV campers. List that space on Campspot, The Dyrt, Boondockers Welcome, Campendium, Harvest Host, and a few others. People are searching for places to park their RVs, and most of them don't need anything fancy.

Better yet, if you own an RV and have it parked there, you can rent out the whole setup. Now people don't even need to bring their own rig. It's basically a one-pad RV park. If demand exceeds supply, add more plugs, more pads, maybe connect to a septic system or city sewer. Suddenly you've got a legitimate RV park. I've been buying those for seven years. Great business.

# #36: Camping

One of my favorite spots on my property is by the water. You can hear the bugs, the frogs. It's quiet and shaded just about all day.

What does that mean? Monetization.

Several websites let you take quiet spots like this and rent them out to tent campers. Campspot is the biggest. Then there's Tentrr (with two Rs), Campspace, Harvest Host. Three to five different peer-to-peer marketplaces where you can rent out mere plots of dirt for $10 to $50 a night.

You don't need hookups. Campers aren't expecting electricity or plumbing. They just want to go camping, usually with their kids. I'm a customer of these websites because I live in Texas, and there aren't a lot of state or national parks here. So we go out to other people's private land and have a great time for about 20 bucks a night.

If you have any semblance of a scenic spot on your property, list it.

# #35: Subdivide Land for Profit

In Texas, and every state has similar laws, if you buy a parcel that's more than 10 acres, you can split it up as long as each resulting parcel is 10.01 acres or more. You don't have to get it rezoned. You just need a new survey.

I have a friend who goes out to West Texas. He'll buy a 500-acre plot. As long as it has a lot of road frontage, he splits it into roughly 50 lots of 10 acres each. Let's say he buys 500 acres for $500,000. He sells each 10-acre lot for $20,000. That's a million dollars on his money. He just pays a few thousand for surveying costs.

This works in every state. Some more than others. In Texas, if it's under 10 acres, you have to go through all kinds of approvals, septic requirements, the whole rigamarole. But keep it at 10.01 acres or more, and you can subdivide without jumping through hoops.

# #34: Heavy Equipment Parking

That company I hired to dig out an in-ground trampoline? They dig out pools, level land for new home construction. And they need a place to park their excavators, skid steers, flatbed trucks.

It doesn't matter how rural your land is. There are business owners who need to park heavy equipment somewhere. You can charge $80 to $250 per month per spot. One acre can generate six figures if you fill it with equipment parking.

Websites act as marketplaces for this kind of thing, like Airbnb for parking lots. Use them to find customers.

# #33: Buying Land via Master Lease Agreement

Here's another acquisition strategy that minimizes risk.

A master lease agreement is like a lease-purchase deal. Let's say you can't afford to buy land outright, can't find a loan, or can't swing a down payment. You make lease payments to the owner, but all the cash flow over and above those payments goes to you.

This lets you test the business model before going all-in. One year, three years, five years down the line, you have the option to purchase the property at a predetermined price if things are going well.

I've used this on RV park deals. It's a perfect way to hedge your bets. You get to prove that the economics work before you're locked into a huge purchase.

# #32: Mobile Home Rental

When I bought my property, it had a mobile home on it. The previous owner said, ""That home's worth $30,000 easy."" He was trying to work that into the negotiations.

But I come from the mobile home park world. I knew it wasn't worth 10 grand.

So I said, ""Listen, I'll pay you $20,000 less, and you get the mobile home out of there."" He thought that was a win-win because he believed his own valuation. I knew the real number. He moved the home. I bought the land at a discount. Everyone walked away happy.

Here's the play: buy a piece of land for $100,000. Find a used mobile home for $30,000. Spend $5,000 getting it hooked up and moved. You're all-in at $135,000. But when you put home and land together, that property is now worth over $200,000 because you went through the headache. You added value. Now it's a place where someone can actually live.

You're just connecting two parties, the landowner and the homeowner, and capturing the spread.

# #31: Portable Storage

One of my favorite business ideas, period.

I've got a friend on Twitter who did this in Canada. He found a three or four-acre parcel on a busy road and negotiated a lease-purchase agreement. He told the owner, ""I want to put portable self-storage on this. I don't know if it's going to work. Let me rent it for X amount per month. One year from now, let's sit down and talk. If it's working, I'll buy your property above asking price. If it's not, I'll pick up my portable storage containers and take my ball home.""

Guess what? It worked way better than he imagined. Now he's got a six-figure business that's largely passive. He didn't have to break ground or lay foundation. He bought portable storage containers, had them dropped off on a flatbed truck. He researched Cube Smart and SpareFoot to find out that a 10x10 in his area rents for $130 a month. Fully booked within six months. Now he's copy-pasting this playbook across the country.

You can get loans on this equipment. Private investors are willing to finance portable storage because they can always repo it if things go south. It's a perfect way to hedge your bets, minimize risk, and monetize land without a six-figure down payment.

# #30: Airbnb

Okay, this one's less approachable and less affordable than the other ideas. But it's also probably the most profitable. There's a trade-off.

Build a custom home on your land. I've had a home on Airbnb that rents for $600 to $950 per night. That covers the monthly mortgage payment in about six rentals. I only need 20% occupancy to break even.

List on VRBO and Airbnb. Then list on Peerspace, which lets photographers and videographers rent your space for photo shoots or filming. It's much cheaper for them to rent a nice property for a few hours than a professional studio, but it's often just as good or better.

About 30% of my tenants used the house for weddings. And weddings? Those cost $3,000 to $6,000 just for the venue for half a day. That covers the monthly payment in one booking.

List on Zola, The Knot, Wedding Wire, Airbnb, VRBO, Peerspace. What's your occupancy when you combine all those platforms? Close to 100%.

# #29: Barndominium Rental

Here's a word that didn't exist 10 or 15 years ago but is all the rage today: barndominium.

When I had my metal building built, it cost about 60 grand. Today they're more expensive. You need a six-inch slab, plumbing run to it, electrical. Not trying to oversimplify, but these metal buildings in a box are outrageously in demand right now.

Storage, pickleball, barndominiums, wood shops, cabinetry, metal shops, auto repair, auto body. The list goes on. I've rented mine out to several different types of business owners. It's 2,100 square feet and rents for $2,500 to $3,500 a month.

When you have covered, air-conditioned space, even in a rural area, there's demand. People need to store stuff. Companies pay monthly to store old electronics. You can charge by the square foot, by the month. Classic cars. We get requests for all kinds of things.

# #28: Indoor Storage

Even without air conditioning, even out in a rural area, covered space has value.

People need to store stuff. Period. If you've got a building, you can rent it out for storage. Companies will pay you monthly to store equipment, inventory, vehicles, whatever. Charge by the square foot or set a flat monthly rate.

Classic cars are a big one. Collectors don't want their vehicles sitting outside in the elements. A simple covered structure becomes a revenue generator.

# #27: Tree Farm

One of my favorite businesses that no one ever talks about: tree farms and nurseries.

You can buy seedlings and plant them. Or you can buy seeds and plant from scratch. I love this business because with patience come profits.

A live oak tree that's $200 at retail is actually pretty easy to grow from an acorn. Live oaks, shumard oaks, pecans, cedar elms, and maples all do really well from seed. Some other species require a lot of babying and are likely to fail in the first few months. But these hardwoods are resilient.

Consider the unit economics. If you have free water or close to free water, or you can rely on rainfall, and you can wait three to four years, you can sell these trees for hundreds of dollars each. Sell direct to retail through Facebook Marketplace or Facebook ads. Or go wholesale to the landscaping companies and nurseries you see driving around. They're not planting from scratch. They're buying from growers.

You can plant thousands of trees on one acre, especially since they start as small seedlings. You can do the same with blackberry bushes, grape vines, blueberries.

# #26: Bitcoin Mining

This idea comes with a lot of asterisks. But if you have an electrical panel with some empty space, you should consider Bitcoin or crypto mining.

I've been in this industry for a while. I've had years where I've done well and years where I've lost my shirt. Buyer beware. Do your own research. You need a professional electrician to hook it up. Your everyday wall outlet isn't going to cut it.

You have to understand hash rate, difficulty rate, the price of Bitcoin, how many other miners are mining at any given time. But if certain things align, you can make really good money mining cryptocurrency. Just beware of noise, heat, and space constraints.

# #25: Pickleball Club

You may have seen me post content about the indoor pickleball club I'm launching. It's going inside my air-conditioned building. We still have to tear out a room, clean it, paint the floors.

I actually have a portable pickleball court that I'm using to prove demand before I spend too much money on permanent floor painting. Even in rural areas, there's demand for indoor, air-conditioned, weather-proof private pickleball play. People can come with their nerdy pickleball friends, have drinks. We're adding a golf simulator, cold plunge, sauna. It's going to be a whole vibe.

If you're too rural, this won't work. But if you're in the suburbs of a growing metro like I am, the demand is real.

# #24: Youth Sports Training

In the suburbs of Dallas-Fort Worth, youth sports is everything. And there aren't enough places for coaches to train kids.

They can't go to gyms because gyms don't want them there. They can't go to schools because schools are usually practicing. That leaves a gap in the market.

These coaches get paid between $40 and $200 an hour for private one-on-one or small group sessions. Softball, baseball, golf, tennis, pickleball, basketball, football. Especially basketball, football, and baseball.

I'm building a full-court pickleball court that doubles as a half-court basketball court. Fixed hoop in the middle, three-point line laid out. The concrete cost about $6 to $8 per square foot. Five-inch concrete, rebar, vapor barrier. After fencing, lighting, and the hoop, I'm all-in around $32,000. If I'd hired a general contractor, it would've been $50,000 to $60,000.

One business is being that general contractor yourself. Find the subcontractors, build sport courts. Look at Google Trends for sport court searches. They're booming.

If you build it, they will come. If you use Facebook ads. They left that part out of the movie.

# #23: Growing and Selling Crepe Myrtle Trees That Multiply

I have a great crepe myrtle. Paid about 30 bucks for it nine years ago. Planted it. It's nice and big now.

Here's the gift that keeps on giving: shoots come up about once a month. You get about a half dozen new shoots. As long as they're not connected to the trunk and they're coming from the ground, you can transplant them into a pot, be patient, and sell them for $30 to $300 years down the line depending on size.

This is passive income that literally grows out of the ground.

# #22: Pallet Reclamation

I used to own a third-party logistics company called Send Eats. We would receive massive pallets full of peanut butter, makeup, you name it. We had too many pallets. We weren't shipping out as many as we received.

I would post them on Facebook Marketplace and just give them away. Selling was a hassle because of the negotiation. Giving them away was easier. That's when I met all these business owners running pallet reclamation operations.

Here's how it works: you go to Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, local businesses, and warehouses. You take pallets for free. You're providing value because these businesses have dumpsters they're paying hundreds of dollars a month to throw stuff away. They'd rather give it to you.

You take the pallets, use a crowbar and hammer, disassemble them, fix the broken boards, make them look nice, and sell them for $5 to $12 each. That's 100% gross profit margin on the raw material.

Some businesses need a reliable supply because they're shipping more pallets than they receive. Some need a reliable way to offload them. You're the middleman. Build a book of business through cold calls, emails, texts, or just asking around.

You can even build stuff out of pallets. I posted a video about a couple that built a bar out of pallets and sold it for good money. They also rented it out to weddings for hundreds of dollars per event.

Where do you store all these pallets? On some unwanted or unloved land.

# #21: Disc Golf Hole-in-One Challenge

This one's pretty random, but hear me out.

There's a hole-in-one golf challenge in New Zealand. They give you $10,000 if you get a hole-in-one on a floating tee about 80 yards out in a lake.

I took this concept, bought a target for 100 bucks, went to a popular park where kids were playing soccer, and held up a sign: ""$3 for one shot from 30 feet to get a hole-in-one. $5 for three shots. If you win, you get $100.""

Less than 5% of people win. It's extremely profitable. It's like a carnival game. I was surprised how much money this little hack made.

# #20: Fruit Orchard

Especially if you have a natural water source like a dug well, what's stopping you from planting a fruit orchard?

Did you know the Peach Truck is a $100 million business selling peaches online? My friend Isaac French planted a 300-tree fruit orchard that provides tens of thousands of pounds of fruit to his community in central Texas every year. He spent about $75,000 total for trees, irrigation, and concrete sidewalks throughout.

Do your research on varieties that work best in your zone. You may need to cross-pollinate some species. But orchards can be a lot more profitable than you might think. Sell to farm stands, directly through e-commerce, or at farmers markets.

# #19: EV Charging

Two websites allow peer-to-peer EV charging: PlugShare and EVmatch.

You can also contract with Tesla to add Supercharging to a property. They'll only want certain locations off highways. Lots of asterisks here. Tesla will pay for all the transformers and equipment, but they won't let you mark up the electricity directly. You can monetize the foot traffic if you have a business.

If you pay Tesla for the equipment yourself, you can mark up the electricity. Add solar or other renewable energy, and letting electric car owners use your charger can add up fast.

# #18: Portable Pickleball Court Sales or Rental

I have a portable pickleball court. It weighs several hundred pounds. Think of it like a wrestling mat but thinner. It rolls out, already has lines on it.

I'm using this to prove demand before I spend too much renovating my building for permanent courts. It's impermanent. I can test the business model, validate that people actually want this, before going all-in.

You could also sell or rent these to other people looking to start pickleball businesses, host tournaments, or set up temporary courts for events.

# #17: Photography Rental

A photographer we used for Christmas card photos saw our property and made a proposition: ""I'll park my vintage VW van in your yard and have my clients come get their pictures taken here. Let me do that, and I'll give you your pictures for free this year.""

That's monetization. We said yes.

Five different websites let you take your property, building, or raw land, as long as it's somewhat scenic, and rent it to photographers and videographers by the minute, hour, or day. You can make it scenic with a wedding arch or other touches.

The websites: Giggster, Here Space, Home Studio List, Scouty, and Avvay. List on all of them, optimize with keyword-rich descriptions and professional pictures, and wait for bookings.

# #16: Pop-Up Restaurant

Three types of pop-ups are booming right now.

First, pizza oven pop-ups. Buy a $500 to $1,200 authentic Neapolitan-style pizza oven. Post to local Instagram, Facebook groups, Facebook Marketplace, neighborhood HOA groups, Nextdoor. Get people to place orders ahead of time for $10 to $25 per pizza. Make all the pizzas in a day, people come pick them up, Venmo you in advance. You can make a grand for an afternoon of making pizza.

Second, barbecue. Same model. People order brisket and pork butt ahead of time.

Third, Blackstone or griddle cooking.

All three of these require between $500 and $1,500 in equipment. With a small investment and willingness to sell to friends, family, and neighbors, you can make good income cooking food. Great for foodies who love cooking anyway.

Whoever said never monetize your hobbies was wrong. If your hobby is monetizing things, you can never go wrong.

# #15: Firewood

I reached out to a bunch of tree trimming companies in the area. One of them is mine. Whenever they cut down a huge oak tree, they drop the logs here.

Remember, firewood sells for $400 to $700 per cord. During the winter, we split it all up with a hydraulic splitter, stack it, and sell it. I pay some high schoolers to help, and it helps pay for college expenses.

Never underestimate the power of good hardwood. Pecan, oak, maple. These deciduous hardwoods are much more valuable than soft pine. You can sell firewood for $400 to $900 a cord depending on time of year and location.

You can also sell hardwood to barbecue restaurants or enthusiasts. You can fetch even more as smoking wood than as firewood. I know this because I'm a barbecue enthusiast and I own a firewood business.

A piece of land with mature hardwoods is worth more. Often the seller or realtor doesn't know that. It's not 20-30% more, but it's marginally more. And it's something.

# #14: Shed Building

You can assemble or build sheds on site and sell them on Facebook Marketplace. Get plans online, learn the process, invest in a table saw and chop saw.

There's a business called Shed Ramps that does over $10 million in revenue. Guess what they do? Make and sell shed ramps. Some imported from China, some built on-site.

Build sheds, build shed ramps, sell shed accessories. There are a million ways to make a million bucks.

# #13: Disc Golf Course

What's the second fastest-growing sport in the world right now? Not pickleball. Disc golf.

I bought a target for 100 bucks on Amazon. I have two of them. I'm eventually going to put a nine-hole disc golf course on my property.

Is disc golf super profitable? No. But it's cool. It's fun. It's unique. People will donate or you can charge admission. Most courses don't charge, but you can. What's stopping you?

If you build a good reputation, they actually have disc golf vending machines where you can sell discs for $20 to $30 each. Not my favorite business idea, but there's a lot to be said for businesses that are just fun.

# #12: Portable Sawmill

We hire what's called an Alaskan sawmill or portable sawmill. This guy comes in, takes big red oak logs, and turns them into slabs. You can make end tables, coffee tables, two-to-four-inch slabs.

Stack them up and let them season for months or years. Then sell by the board foot to woodworkers and enthusiasts. They turn it on a lathe or make furniture.

I have cedar, white oak, red oak, live oak logs. You pay someone about $60 an hour to slice it all up. Then you let it sit. Once it's seasoned, no bugs, dried out, done warping, you can sell it for good money.

The crazy thing? I'm not paying for this wood. Tree trimming companies have to pay the dump to take it. They pay me nothing. They're happy to drop it off. I just tell them I only want the big valuable stuff, not the brush, small pieces, or mulch.

One acre is 43,000 square feet. This wood takes up about 200 square feet. Half a percent of the acreage. Total win-win.

# #11: Pecan Tree Profits

Pecan trees are hardwood. Hardwood trees are much more valuable than softwood pine.

You can sell the firewood, but you can also sell the nuts. You can sell the wood to barbecue restaurants. One tree, multiple revenue streams.

And pecans do really well grown from seed. With patience, you're looking at trees worth hundreds of dollars that cost you almost nothing but time.

# #10: Decomposed Granite Sales

This is called DG. Not Dollar General. Decomposed granite, also known as crushed granite.

It's a road base. A little more expensive than gravel because it's got a nice red color, compacts well, drains well, and looks good. A good hybrid of those three qualities.

I spent a few hundred for a whole truckload. Here's what I learned: if you buy directly from the quarries, you get it at a huge discount. A company like Living Earth might sell it for $50 to $70 a cubic yard. But buy directly from a quarry in Oklahoma? About $20 a yard.

What you can do is use Replit or Lindy to make a lead form. Push paid ads to it and play middleman. You're basically drop-shipping decomposed granite. Or buy it, store it on your land, list it on Facebook Marketplace. People come pick it up. For an extra $200 to $300, throw it on a trailer and deliver it.

People use this product daily. It's not sexy, but the demand is constant.

# #9: Side Yard Parking

Did you know you can make money from that empty unused space on the side of your house?

Six different websites let you rent out otherwise unused space to people who need to park their car, truck, boat, RV, whatever. The six I know: Truck Parking Club, Neighbor,com, Spacer, Stow It, Curb Flip, and Pavement.

What's stopping you from listing your spot on all six, optimizing with professional pictures and keyword-rich descriptions, and waiting for bookings?

# #8: Hydraulic Firewood Splitter Rental

As much as my wife loves watching me split firewood by hand, a man gets tired.

I paid $1,500 for a 27-ton hydraulic splitter. You put the log in, pull the lever, and it splits cleanly in half. So satisfying.

If you can't find enough customers for a firewood business, rent this thing out for $80 to $90 a day on Facebook Marketplace. People cut down trees and want to convert them to firewood, but they have no need to buy a $1,500 splitter. They'll rent it from you for $80 to $160 and do it themselves.

When you have land, you have plenty of space to store equipment like this.

# #7: Transplanting Large Trees With a Tree Spade

All over Texas and the United States, properties need to be mulched or cleared for building. There's a big business in playing middleman between forestry mulchers, land clearers, tree trimming companies, and people who own tree spades.

A tree spade is either an attachment for a skid steer or a standalone machine with four hydraulic blades. It sticks into the ground, pulls out the tree with the root ball, puts it in a pot, loads it on a truck for transport.

Instead of a homeowner paying thousands to shamefully cut down a 14-inch diameter live oak, they can get it removed for free. The middleman finds someone who wants a mature tree. Maybe they don't want to pay $2,500. Maybe they'll pay $1,000.

You take the spread between those two parties. You could own the spade for about $4,000, or find a guy who has one and play middleman while he does the work.

We don't have to cut down as many trees. Just transplant them.

# #6: Septic Install and Repairs

You would not believe the unit economics of the septic tank business.

How many people in high school said, ""I want to grow up and own a septic tank business""? Literally no one. That's exactly why they're incredibly profitable. It's dirty. It's unsexy. Nobody wants to get into it. Net profit margins are 20-40%.

When I wanted to add a simple bathroom to my shop, you know how many people wanted to come out and fix my old septic system? None. They all said I need a new system. $15,000. Why? Because they can. Because there's much more demand than supply. They're in the driver's seat.

Start or buy a septic tank repair or installation business. The barrier to entry keeps everyone else out.

# #5: Fiber Cable Install

I wanted fiber internet. The road near my house has fiber from Frontier, but the road closer to my property doesn't.

I paid some guys $500 to come in with a ditch witch, dig a trench, and lay fiber optic cable from one road to the other. Now I have fiber internet.

That's an entire industry. Finding customers that almost never leave. When they sell the house, the new homeowners become your customers. This guy makes six figures a year with very little overhead. There are upfront costs to lay the fiber, but once it's in, it's there for decades.

People think AT&T and Spectrum own the market. No. There's so much left for the taking, especially in rural areas. You can use your land to store fiber optic cable, buy and rent out ditch witches, or just run your business from there.

# #4: Pond Cleaning

About a year ago, I interviewed these college students in Chicago. They were doing landscaping for a woman who lived on a lake. The lake had yucky seaweed and weeds around her dock. Her grandkids wanted to swim but couldn't because it was disgusting.

She asked if they could clean it out. Their first instinct was to say no. How do you clean a lake? But they said yes to everything, like me. They drove to Home Depot, bought $20 rakes, and stood waist-deep in the water, raking the bed of the lake. The gunk floated to the top. They grabbed it and threw it on shore.

It took hours, but they made $500. Then the neighbor came out. Then another neighbor. ""Can you do mine? I didn't even know this was possible.""

Their sales pitch: ""We don't use chemicals. It's all natural.""

They started J&D Lake Services. Making six figures a year. College students. Then a guy with a $200,000 lake-cleaning machine, basically a floating skid steer, leased it to them with nothing down. Just a good guy helping young entrepreneurs.

This is a brand-new industry. You can use third-party tools to find all the homes that have ponds or live on lakes. You don't do it manually. Then you reach out: ""I bet no one's ever offered to clean your pond or lake before. I'll do that.""

Charge hundreds per hour. No expensive equipment needed to start. If someone knocked on my door offering to clean my pond, I'd say yes and pay them. I'm not getting in there.

# #3: Pool Rental

Have you heard of Swimply, Swimmie, or Resort Pass?

These are like Airbnb for pools. People monetize their pools by renting them out to individuals by the hour or day. Some people, especially in warm climates like Phoenix, San Diego, or Los Angeles, rent a house with a pool, don't even live in it, and only use it to rent out the backyard pool on Swimply.

Some are making six figures a year. Charge extra for catering, drinks, a lifeguard, toys. This industry is booming as the sharing economy expands.

If you have land and can install a pool, you're adding a revenue generator that works whether you're home or not.

# #2: Shed Moving

I have a friend in North Carolina with a $650,000-a-year business. Over half is profit.

All he does is set up a tracker that watches Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace for people getting rid of sheds. Most give them away for free because no one wants a shed. Or they'll pay to have it removed because they're selling the house and the buyer won't close until the shed is gone.

He reaches out: ""Either I'll come get it for free, or pay me and I'll take it.""

He has a machine that slides forks underneath the shed, lifts it up, and puts it on a flatbed truck. By the time it's on the truck, it's already sold. He gets pictures from the seller beforehand, lists it on Facebook Marketplace with free delivery included. That's the big hangup for buyers. Who has a massive flatbed truck? Nobody.

He sells sheds for $400 to $2,000 that he got for free. It's just his time.

Those flatbed trucks can be expensive, but you can rent them to prove the business model first. He also supplements about 30% of his income through shed companies. Every time they sell a new shed, they need someone to deliver it. They're not in the delivery business. They call him, pay $400 to $500 for pickup and delivery.

Multiple businesses all in one shed.

# #1: Culvert Sales and Install

I am sitting inside a 30-inch diameter, 20-foot culvert that I had cut in half and delivered to my property for $900.

I bought it from a company that does seven figures a year. Guess what they do? Sell culverts. That's it.

Most people go their whole lives never hearing or saying the word culvert. It doesn't apply to them. But I have property split in half by a ditch. I wanted to drive from front to back and couldn't. I had to put in massive culverts.

I started with smaller ones that quickly got washed out. Now I have two 30-inch diameter culverts. I rented an excavator for 600 bucks, spent the day having a blast, moving dirt around. And it taught me there's a big market for culverts.

I checked Google Keyword Tool and Google Trends. People are searching for culverts. They're hard to find. With more people buying rural properties post-COVID, trying to live that farm lifestyle, the demand is huge.

Large and small. PVC, corrugated metal, corrugated plastic, ribbed. When a municipality widens a road or lays fiber, they throw away old culverts. They pay someone to haul them off.

I found culverts driving around. The city was throwing them away. I asked if I could take them. ""Sure."" Listed them on Facebook Marketplace. Sold them for hundreds, even thousands combined.

Buy directly from the manufacturer. Store on your land. List on Facebook Marketplace. If organic listings don't get traction, boost them. People come pick up, or you deliver for an extra $200 to $300.

I'm calling this business Culvert City, California.

# The Bottom Line

Look, if you buy a parcel of land for $50,000, you can get a 30-year mortgage on that. Your payment is going to be about $200 to $350 a month. Less than your car payment.

You cannot tell me you can't at least cover that payment with all of these options.

There are no more excuses.

One acre is 43,000 square feet of opportunity. You can stack multiple businesses on the same piece of land. Camping plus firewood plus storage plus parking. That's four income streams from dirt.

Not every idea here is going to fit your situation. Some require more capital. Some require more hustle. Some require patience. But the point is this: that scraggly, overgrown, forgotten piece of land that most people drive right past? That's not a liability.

It's an asset waiting to be activated.

Now go find yours.

Hindi ko rin alam if yung MC ba is during the reception lang or kung ano yung flow of the events and if kailangan ba ako from the start. I'm not well versed in the islam culture din po so I would very much like to learn to be appropriate for the wedding day.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

# What Is Google AntiGravity Video Automation

Google AntiGravity is a next-generation AI workspace that builds anything from text commands — apps, websites, dashboards, and now, videos.

When you connect Remotion AI to it, AntiGravity becomes a free AI-powered video studio.

You can literally type commands like:

Create a 5-second coffee shop animation  
Animate a glowing startup logo  
Build a robot intro video about AI automation

And within seconds, you’ll have a fully rendered video ready to use.

That’s what makes Google AntiGravity Video Automation so powerful — it gives you the ability of a full production studio in a chat window.



# Setting Up Remotion AI in AntiGravity

Setup takes under 5 minutes.

Open AntiGravity, paste the Remotion GitHub skill, and say:

Install Remotion so I can automate videos in this chat.

AntiGravity fetches the setup instructions, installs everything automatically, and confirms when done.

Once installed, you can start creating animations instantly — all within your workspace.

No coding.  
No plugins.  
No subscriptions.

Just Google AntiGravity Video Automation at work.



# Example: Coffee Shop Animation

To test it, I typed:

Create a 5-second coffee shop intro animation.

Within seconds, AntiGravity rendered a complete video sequence — motion graphics, lighting, animation, and text fades.

All handled by Remotion AI.

It even tailored the branding for my AI Profit Boardroom community.

That one line of text replaced hours of manual work.



# Customizing with Your Logo

Now let’s say you’ve got your own logo.

You can upload it directly into AntiGravity and type:

Animate this logo for my AI automation community.

AntiGravity takes your logo, applies your brand colors, and builds a professional animated intro.

In my case, I used my AI Profit Boardroom logo — and it created a glowing branded animation in under a minute.

No After Effects.  
No Fiverr gigs.  
No cost.

Just AI doing the work.



# The Old Way vs. The New Way

Old Way

* Hire a video editor
* Wait for revisions
* Pay monthly for editing software
* Spend hours learning complex tools

New Way with Google AntiGravity Video Automation

* Create 10+ videos a day
* Get unlimited styles instantly
* Pay nothing
* No learning curve
* Total control

This is what Remotion AI and AntiGravity make possible — infinite video creation without bottlenecks.

If you want the full setup guide, prompts, and frameworks, check out Julian Goldie’s FREE AI Success Lab Community here: [https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/](https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/)

Inside, you’ll get a 30-day Google AntiGravity Video Automation roadmap, 100 free prompts for Remotion AI, and step-by-step tutorials with GitHub links.

Over 48,000 members are already using it to build animations, short-form content, and branded videos for free.



# Example: AI Robot Animation

Next, I tested this prompt:

Create an animated robot about AI automation.

AntiGravity loaded the Remotion package, rendered the animation, and displayed it live inside chat — all within 60 seconds.

The AI handled the code, frame rendering, and final output automatically.

No timeline.  
No waiting.  
Just instant results.

That’s the magic of Google AntiGravity Video Automation.



# Why This Matters

Because in 2026, speed is everything.

Content velocity is leverage.

If you can create 10x more videos at zero cost, you have an unfair advantage.

Every video you automate is another opportunity to grow your brand, sell, or teach.

With AntiGravity as your engine and Remotion AI as your production team, you’re unstoppable.



# Old Beliefs vs. New Reality

Old Belief: I need to hire video editors  
New Reality: AI is my 24/7 production team

Old Belief: AI tools are too technical  
New Reality: If I can describe it, AI can build it

You don’t need to code.

You just describe what you want — and Google AntiGravity Video Automation builds it.



# The Future of AI Video Creation

This is just the beginning.

Soon, AntiGravity will integrate full voiceover sync, caption rendering, and multi-scene video stitching.

You’ll be able to type:

Create a 30-second product video with voiceover, captions, and B-roll.

And get a finished video instantly.

AI is moving from assistance to automation — and Google AntiGravity Video Automation is the clearest example of that shift.

Like literally everyone I know is dealing with some form of it. Whether it's the constant doomscrolling, worrying about money, comparing yourself to everyone's highlight reel on social media, or just existing in 2025. I used to think I was broken or weak for feeling anxious all the time but then I went down this massive research rabbit hole (books, neuroscience podcasts, therapy apps, youtube deep dives) and realized this is just how our brains are wired. Evolution didn't prepare us for modern life. Your amygdala literally can't tell the difference between a tiger chasing you and your boss sending a vague ""can we talk?"" email. Wild right?

The thing is, anxiety disorders are the most common mental health issue in the US, affecting like 40 million adults. And most people never get help because they think it's just who they are. But here's what I learned from all this research, anxiety isn't a personality trait you're stuck with. Your brain is incredibly plastic and you can literally rewire the neural pathways that keep you stuck in fight or flight mode. These aren't just fluffy self help tips, this is legit neuroscience mixed with practical stuff that actually moves the needle.

understand what's actually happening in your brain

Anxiety isn't ""all in your head"" in the dismissive way people mean it. It's a very real physiological response. Dr Bessel van der Kolk (trauma researcher, wrote [""The Body Keeps the Score""](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.amazon.in/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748) which won tons of awards and is used in like every psychology program) explains that trauma and chronic stress literally change your brain structure. Your nervous system gets stuck in hypervigilance mode.

When you're anxious, your sympathetic nervous system is activated, pumping cortisol and adrenaline. Your prefrontal cortex (the rational thinking part) goes offline and your amygdala (fear center) takes over. This is why you can't just ""think your way out"" of a panic attack. You need to work with your body first, then your mind follows.

use physiological sighs to hack your nervous system

This sounds too simple but it's backed by Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman. He talks about this constantly on his podcast. A physiological sigh is two quick inhales through your nose followed by a long exhale through your mouth. Like this: breathe in, breathe in again immediately, then looong exhale.

This isn't woo woo breathing exercises. It literally offloads CO2 from your bloodstream faster than any other breathing pattern and directly calms your autonomic nervous system. Do it 2-3 times when you feel anxiety creeping up. I use this before meetings, social situations, literally anytime I feel that chest tightness starting. Works in like 30 seconds.

box breathing for when shit gets intense

If the physiological sigh isn't cutting it and you need something more structured, box breathing is your friend. Navy seals use this in combat situations so yeah, it works. Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat for a few minutes.

The app [Breathwrk](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/breathwrk-breathing-exercises/id1481804500) has guided sessions for this and other breathing patterns. Honestly one of the best apps I've downloaded. They have different patterns for anxiety, panic attacks, better sleep, energy, etc. The science is solid and it just works.

get out of your head and into your body

Anxiety lives in rumination. You're stuck in thought loops about the future (what if this happens) or past (why did I say that). Grounding techniques force you back into the present moment where anxiety can't survive.

Try the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste. Sounds kinda dumb but it literally interrupts the anxiety spiral by forcing your brain to engage with sensory input instead of catastrophic thoughts.

Also, cold exposure. Like actually shocking your system with cold water. Take a cold shower or splash ice cold water on your face. This activates your vagus nerve which signals safety to your brain. Again, Huberman talks about this extensively. The immediate physiological response overrides the anxiety response. Plus you feel like a badass afterward.

progressive muscle relaxation actually works

This technique was developed in the 1930s and is still used in CBT today because it genuinely works. You systematically tense and then release different muscle groups. Start with your toes, tense them hard for 5 seconds, then release. Move up through your calves, thighs, stomach, chest, arms, face.

Anxiety creates so much physical tension that you don't even notice anymore. Your shoulders are probably up by your ears right now. This exercise teaches your body what relaxation actually feels like and gives you something active to do when anxiety hits. The app [Insight Timer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insight-timer-meditate-sleep/id337472899) has tons of free guided progressive muscle relaxation sessions. Way better than other meditation apps imo, their library is massive and most of it is free.

actually understand your triggers

Most people are anxious and have no idea why. They just walk around in a constant state of dread. Start tracking your anxiety. When does it spike? What were you doing? Who were you with? What did you eat? How much sleep did you get?

Dr Judson Brewer (psychiatrist, wrote [""Unwinding Anxiety""](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.amazon.in/Unwinding-Anxiety-Train-Brain-Obsession/dp/0593184166) and directs research at Brown University) explains that anxiety is often a learned habit loop. Trigger, anxiety, behavior (avoidance, overthinking, whatever), temporary relief, repeat. Once you identify your specific triggers and patterns, you can interrupt them. His app [Unwinding Anxiety](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unwinding-anxiety/id1499895000) is specifically designed for this and is actually based on clinical trials. It's not just some cash grab app, the research behind it is legit.

If you want a more structured way to understand your anxiety patterns and build a personalized plan to manage them, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from neuroscience research, psychology books, and expert insights to create adaptive learning plans tailored to your specific struggles.

You can tell it something like ""help me manage social anxiety as an introvert"" or ""I want to stop overthinking at night,"" and it generates audio content from sources like ""The Body Keeps the Score,"" Andrew Huberman's research, and other anxiety experts. You can adjust the depth too, a quick 10-minute summary when you're low energy or a 40-minute deep dive with examples when you want to go deeper. It also has this virtual coach avatar you can chat with about your unique triggers, which helps connect the dots between all these techniques and your actual life.

reframe anxiety as excitement

This sounds like toxic positivity but hear me out. Research from Harvard Business School shows that reframing anxiety as excitement actually works better than trying to calm down. Why? Because anxiety and excitement have nearly identical physiological signatures. Increased heart rate, heightened alertness, energy surge. The only difference is your interpretation.

When you feel anxious, literally say out loud ""I'm excited"" instead of ""I'm anxious."" Your body is already revved up, so trying to force calm is fighting against your physiology. But redirecting that energy toward excitement? That works with your body, not against it.

limit the anxiety fuel you're consuming

Caffeine, alcohol, sugar, lack of sleep, doomscrolling. These are all anxiety amplifiers. I'm not saying become a monk but pay attention to how these affect you. For me, more than one coffee turns me into an anxious wreck. Took me years to make that connection.

Also, the constant information overload. Your nervous system wasn't designed to process global catastrophes, political chaos, and everyone's filtered lives simultaneously. Set boundaries with news and social media. Mute accounts that make you feel like shit. Unfollow people whose content triggers comparison anxiety. Curate your digital environment like your mental health depends on it because it does.

move your body in literally any way

Exercise is probably the most evidence based intervention for anxiety that exists. It metabolizes stress hormones, increases endorphins, improves sleep, builds self efficacy. You don't need to become a gym bro or run marathons. Just move. Walk, dance, stretch, whatever.

Research shows that just 20 minutes of moderate exercise significantly reduces anxiety. The book [""Spark""](https://www.amazon.in/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-Brain/dp/0316113514) by Dr John Ratey (Harvard psychiatry professor, pioneered research on exercise and brain health) breaks down exactly how movement changes your brain chemistry. Insanely good read if you want to understand the neuroscience. After reading it I actually started exercising consistently because I finally understood it wasn't about aesthetics or discipline, it was literally medicine for my brain.

consider therapy, specifically CBT or somatic approaches

If anxiety is seriously impacting your life, don't try to tough it out alone. Cognitive behavioral therapy has decades of research showing its effectiveness for anxiety disorders. It teaches you to identify and challenge distorted thought patterns and gradually face fears through exposure.

Somatic therapy is also incredibly effective, especially if your anxiety has roots in trauma. It focuses on releasing stored tension and trauma from your body. The app [Bloom](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bloom-cbt-therapy-self-care/id1475128511) has CBT based exercises and daily check ins. It's like having a pocket therapist. Way more affordable than actual therapy if that's not accessible right now.

Look, anxiety is always gonna be part of being human. But it doesn't have to run your life. These tools work if you actually use them consistently. You're not broken, your nervous system is just doing what it was designed to do in an environment it wasn't designed for. Start with one thing, build from there. Your brain is changeable, your patterns aren't permanent.",1,1769521347.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False

1qodzs2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Revolut/comments/1qodzs2/breaking_news_revolut_is_actually_superb_if_youre/,Breaking news: Revolut is actually superb if you’re not shady or do shady stuff (my review as a normal user),"I wanted to share my experience with Revolut because so many people complain here, and you rarely see reviews from those who have zero issues. I was actually one of those people who was very hesitant to sign up after reading the horror stories on this sub.

That being said, I’ve had no issues at all. I transfer in hundreds sometimes thousands of euros per month and split bills with friends outside of Revolut(they just send payments directly to my account via bank transfer). I’ve never had to explain a transfer or provide proof of where the money came from. I use my card for almost everything such as groceries, gas, bills, coffee, and shopping, in other words NORMAL HUMAN behavior.

Revolut is a bank; it’s not some lawless Wild West just because it lacks physical branches. I think many people forget that. You have these dodgy people signing up thinking it’s some deep-web, anonymous platform where they can do whatever they want with privacy, but it’s no different from any other bank. If you do shady shit like suspicious transfers, receiving ridiculously large sums of money that you in turn transfer onwards or spend in matter of days or trying to circumvent sanctions, you absolutely most definitely will get your account locked and funds frozen. I’m almost certain 9/10 posts here complaining about frozen funds fall into one of those buckets.

All in all, Revolut has been great. As for the people saying they don't know why their account was locked, yes they do. They know damn well why it happened, and they’re just playing dumb and throwing a tantrum because they can’t get their sketchy money out anymore that they feel like they are entitled to.",48,1769520900.0,Revolut,6,0.85,False
1qodzjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbandonedHomes/comments/1qodzjp/are_you_seeking_goal_of_life/,are you seeking goal of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We’re expecting our first baby and starting to shop for a travel system, and the options are overwhelming, and everyone recommends a different one, so we’re trying to narrow it down based on features. I’m hoping folks with experience can talk to me about some of the different features.

\- Swiveling car seat base - does it make life that much easier?

\- Pramette/bassinet attachment vs. integrated lie-flat seat vs. near-flat seat - the sales person at Nordstrom mentioned that some of the strollers with near-flat seats were only suitable for 6+ months? 

\- Do I need one with a reversible seat/bassinet, or does it matter if they can only face one way?

\- Are there other features you would prioritize?

We live in the suburbs and will be getting in and out of the car a lot, hopefully taking baby with me for errands and coffee if they’ll tolerate it. Also going for long walks in the neighborhood but not jogging or off-roading. Baby is due in August and I imagine I’ll want to be out and about enjoying the fall within the first few months. We’re probably one and done so the ability to convert to a double stroller is not a consideration. ",2,1769520807.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False

NOAA had issued Extreme Cold Weather advisories across New England for Friday evening through to Saturday; the perfect weather to keep all the flatlanders away from your snow globe sanctuary.

Every Friday in winter, for the last four years, you've thrown your split-board in the rusty 2002 Subaru Legacy (your mother bought ""Certified-Used"" when you were three years old) and headed out to the bowl, usually staying 'til the last run at 9PM.

You could have gone to UVM on a Green and Gold scholarship, but you asked your mom to stop at a ski mountain on the way home from the visit to the big city. Between your grades and a single parent income, you got offered a second full ride scholarship in exchange for being a dash of local flavor at the rich kid school. The modest slopes and three chair lifts were the key value proposition of the private college.

Tonight, there was only a small gang of snowboarders at the shelter and a few rogue skiers whipping about. With the harder snow from last week's melt, you opted for skis, grabbing your poles from the trunk. A face-warmer and goggles were absolutely necessary, leaving nothing exposed to the cold.

It was a string of empty chairs all the way up the mountain, but as you scooted forward for your first ride up, a skier turned at speed and stopped directly on the line next to you, right as you bent your knees for the chair to pick you up. You glanced at the lift operator, as if to say ""did you see that"", but Brett was looking at his phone again.

Looking down as the ground dropped away, the full spectacle of your fellow traveler hit you.

It was as if someone had been transported from Mont Blanc forty years ago into present day Vermont. Long narrow heavy laminated fiberglass skis, massive chunky boots and a mostly neon one piece jumpsuit with bright colorful patchwork. It was so very mid-80s, but also new old stock. The attire was mint, unfaded, unsoiled, equipment without a scratch. It looked like someone spent several thousand dollars on ski gear in the poshest towns of Switzerland money laundering in the go-go eighties, then put the entire getup in a closet for forty years.

""Jody? Is that Jody?""

Oh gosh, this loon knows you, there goes your sanctuary time.

""Yes?"", you stammer.

""I recognize that silicone piercing. It's Carl, Professor Carl Sable. You took my intro to political science course a few semesters ago."", he said.

""Hah! That's some retro outfit you got there."" you say, as you pull down your face warmer, ""I was just thinking about you on the drive here. Public radio is telling the whole country that all your crazy predictions are coming true. The United States is planning to invade Greenland, then perhaps Canada and Russia ...""

""... and it's all because of The Mercator Projection!"" you both shout in unison with a belly laugh.

""Yes, it's difficult to convince someone of the true magnitude of things when they are perpetually shown a world view that systematically distorts reality."", the professor said. ""Hopefully he doesn't invade Russia though.""

""I suppose it's better to have hostile attention directed at the ice covered barren wastelands rather than countries where people actually live."", you offer.

""Always looking at the whole picture, Jody the Panoptic"", the professor quipped.

""I guess so. Lots of time to think on the top of the world"", you say.

The banter paused as a stiff wind made it difficult to hear.

""You are graduating this year, RIGHT? ANY PLANS LINED UP?"" Professor Sable yelled.

You shout: ""WHELP, I had HOPED to get a job in WASHINGTON, but with the way things are turning out, THAT'S LOOKING LIKE A BUST! There's a GLUT of HIGHLY-QUALIFIED people and NO JOBS! I've applied to the graduate program HERE. So I'll probably STICK AROUND for another two years.""

""You're in a STEM TRACK RIGHT!?!"" Carl yelled into silence as the wind stopped abruptly, like everyone in a bustling cafe hushing in unison to hear your answer,

""Yeah, physics major, math minor. My older brother was a video game developer. He taught me how to code when I was ten. I just wanted to be able to make cooler games with him."" you explain, ""I didn't realize that the senior job fair would be mostly defense contractors or the Department of Energy for me.""

""Oh. So you're somehow allergic to money?"" the professor jabbed.

""I don't want to make weapons."" you shoot back.

""Then why not make video games with your brother?"" Carl asked.

You pause, take a deep breath and in a rapid monotonous tone say: ""My brother broke his leg skiing at Killington while visiting for Christmas in 2019. ' multiple surgeries and a lot of pain killers; our mom tried to warn him. He had been working for a big game studio in Portland, but they shutdown in-person for COVID. Then he got laid off the next January. He O.D.ed right before Christmas in 2022. Fentanyl.""

Professor Sable raised his matching mittens abruptly, forgetting there were poles attached to his wrist as he said, ""I'm so sorry. I remember now. You wrote that paper on the legal changes to requirements for criminal prosecution at the DEA.""

""I'm so very sorry for your loss. It's such a terrible epidemic"", he added.

You both tip your skis up as the ramp rises to meet you. As you both slide off the chair, you turned your back and shout over your shoulder:

""Every year, one hundred thousand more ... "",

*... dead Americans.* you say in your head, as you speed away, over The Long Trail and down the back slope riding the edge of darkness.

You consciously pull the end of the caustic sentence so the hundred thousand needles might go deeper if Professor Carl finishes the sentence in his own voice.

You had spent the winter of your freshman year memorizing precision topography of the entire mountain using data downloaded from the Vermont's public geographic information database. You misused some computer lab resources and the expensive plotter at school to print a massive custom shaded topographic map with more detail of the mountain than any available map. It was the exact width of your dorm wall. You even sold a couple digital copies of the pdf to friends.

By your sophomore year, you had built virtual computer models to plan fringe out-of-bounds lines where you could cut out of designated areas for fresh untouched powder. But a ""run in"" with a tree and a concussion alone in the woods ended those adventures. You only ride within the lines now.

You stop on the edge to look at a giant hollowed out Eastern Hemlock with an enormous pile of telltale porcupine droppings frozen in a perfect meter high cone at the bottom.

That's a way to be Jody; what a piece of work.

Someone tries to have a simple conversation and you turn your back to offer them a hundred thousand barbed jabs in return. What a nasty asymmetric defense. What a lonely creature, in a lonely place. Jody the panoptic porcupine, barbs out, alone with a pile of excrement as a warning to all who would come near.

A haunting chill sinks over you. You feel deep regret at your turn of phrase and swift departure. Your flash of rage toward the world turns to guilt. So you head down the backside looking for the electric neon Sable.

You spot him shuffling his antique skis toward the back lift. You go in at full speed, stopping on the line as the chair picks you both up. You smile and wave with all your charm as the operator shoots you a grizzly look.

""Have you ever been to Monterey Jody?"", Carl picks up.

""California? I've never been on a plane professor."" you say.

""Well, as you are probably aware, the college maintains a satellite campus there...""

""Maintained, past-tense. They're shutting it down."" you interrupt.

""... right, but it's not shut down yet."" he continues, ""and they've had a number of students drop out because their visas were canceled, or for sundry other reasons with grants and whatnot."" he explained.

""So they need to maintain a minimum number of butts in seats for the next two years for accreditation. Since you say you don't like bombs, I was thinking ... well they have collected the leading researchers and thinkers in the field of nonproliferation ..."",

""Nukes are very much bombs professor."" you say,

""... not just nukes, their work is much broader, focused on preventing the use of weapons of mass destruction more generally. If you want to apply your world view and talents defensively against war, and against a whole array of weapons, they are the experts."" He pauses.

""Do they have a social media expert?"" you ask.

""HA! No. Yes... free speech is a tricky thing."" he says,

The clutch of rowdy snowboarders set up camp on the nape of a ridgeline on the Long Trail and were trying to scream across Lake Champlain to someone in New York through the inversion layer of ultra-cold compressed air, but the direction of wind wasn't in their favor.

""The cold doesn't bother them?"", Sable asks.

""I think they brought a flask for warmth"", you say.

""Ah ha. Listen, I have it on authority, if you apply, you'll get in. I know you're a Vermonter on scholarship, but there is a little money in a grant for the summer (about five grand when the job is complete) and I can get you a free place to live, right by the beach."" he promises.

""There is a research project a few years old that a group is looking to have updated. They want someone out there this summer, by the first week of June, to update the data and re-run a simulation that's already been done. It's super easy, just updating datasets and hitting run.""

""Do you surf Jody?"", Carl asks, as he ends his pitch.

""What's this simulation about?"" you ask.

""Have you ever heard of star wars?"" he returns,

""Like Obi-Wan Kenobi?"" you say,

""No no, think more like space satellites, like GoldenEye"", he said.

""I broke the joystick on my brother's old controller when I was four and he never let me touch his Nintendo 64 again, so I never really played it"", you say.

""I've never seen the puzzle in a first person shooter"", you add.

""Ahhh―well listen"", he stammered as the top of the lift approached. ""Shoot me an email when you get accepted and I can send you the contact info for the apartment and the research project.""

As you disembarked from the lift, you nearly fell backward as all control on one ski was lost. You look down to see your right ski has structurally failed; it delaminated (split into layers) right at the heel of the binding. The binding holes failed at the same time.

After six years, thousands of runs, back-country trails, rocks, trees, jumps, flips and turns, your split board is finally ""split city"".

""Looks like it's time for some new skis,"" Carl says.

Not wanting to go down from the summit on one ski, you unclip the bindings and try to join the two halves back into a board as best you can, remounting the bindings across both halves.

""That's a neat trick."" Professor Carl says,

""Yeah, it was kind of expensive. It was a sixteenth birthday present. Cost more than my car at the time, ' probably not going to get a new one this season."" you explain.

""Maybe a new board in Monterey then. It was good to see you, but it's cold out here, shoot me an email"".

As he trailed way shouting, ""And Jody... you'll never see all the distortions from a single point."", and with that the neon sable fishered it's way down the hill to a speck.

Gone was your evening, ski season and sanctuary time.

You limp your board down the mountain on one and a half edges, snow packing between the layers, swelling as it goes. You knocked out what ice you could and threw it across the back seat of your mom's old Subaru.

As you wind down the mountain on the back road, you slow down for what looks like a black bear walking along the side of the road on a flat straight.

You stop the car.

Well, that is not right. Because it's January.

All the bears have to be denned up by now. What the hell is this creature?

It turns to cross the road, dragging a massive tree branch above it's head, like a giant rodent flag bearer without a petard.

Jeez-um CROW, its got to be the most massive beaver in Vermont. A fifty pound tank. HOLLLY CRAP.

You look downhill and notice the massive area has been inundated under a sheet of snow covered ice. You'd never noticed that in four years.

Seems like beavers are normally in for the season when you're driving by. Perhaps the record drought put this guy behind on food for the winter.

The enormous magnificent beast stops on the centerline and stares directly at you. It lifts its body to preen some gravel from its chest and belly with its forearms. Slowly. Almost as if to say: ""Yeah, you like that?""

In its glistening pelt, you catch a shimmer of the orbicular bullion that made John Jacob Astor break so bad―a store of wealth and power for survival that could be extremely tempting to commodify, at the most terrible irreparable cost to America.

What a beautiful creature. What a landscape.

Back to your current milieu, you look down to see the oil light has come on again.

You put your four-ways on, kill the ignition, pop the hood, then pull the break as you reach behind the passenger seat to grab a fresh quart of oil and the funnel (and rag) all in one hand.

Normally you don't need a funnel, but with the cold temperature, this could turn into a fluid dynamics comedy. The oil starts to come out of the quart as one giant ball of molasses. You try to stop it immediately as it comes out, but now the ball of oil has formed a column of tacky coffee toffee sucking itself out of the bottle by its own viscosity. Oh lord, make it stop.

As you struggle to contain your imminent ecological crimes against the mountain beaver habitat, two cars speed down the road and swerve around you. A Benz and a Beamer, red and blue, New Jersey and Massachusets, both with campus parking stickers. Freshmen probably. They're done yelling and snowboarding too apparently.

They each clip the whimsy top of the beaver's tree as they swerve back into the right lane. The ancient rodent jerks, then bolts, leaving the tail of his trophy blocking half the road.

You look back down under the hood, you see the slow-motion oil confectionary disaster has mostly been averted by the funnel and your inattention. You put the quart bottle back in the car and throw the beaver his dinner as you wait for the rest of the molasses to get through the funnel.

That could have been a close one.

You stare at the yellow ""05 26"" sticker in the windshield. Last May was the only time Tyler's grandpa let it pass inspection without a hassle. Right before his garage closed in August, that was last time anyone would ever work on this car.

You don't really need a car; you can take the bus or train to visit home, which you've been doing anyhow.

Given the Legacy's mass and current stored gravitational potential energy at an elevation of approximately three hundred meters above sea level, if it didn't start again, does a pathway exist to pilot it into one of Vermont's many privately held steel reserve stockpiles without calling a tow truck, or endangering life and limb with the missile?

... wait wait wait, go back ... this bear beaver story still doesn't make sense.

How in the wintry hell does the beaver get back under the ice? It's negative ten degrees. The ice must be six inches thick by now. It's den is clearly visible fifty yards out, with an entire underworld food storage system protected by six inches of ice armor.

How is it getting under the ice to get home to the den?

This isn't plausible.

You close the hood of the Subaru, and you hear faint muffled craunching. You walk forward ten yards and peer over the edge of the road, you see the beaver has pulled its tree into a large corrugated pipe culvert.

The residual heat from the ground must be keeping the water in the buried pipe from freezing, at the moment. That's the entrance, and it swims to the den from there; a culvert to the underworld. It will probably still freeze hard tonight if it stays as cold as they're saying. That might be its last fresh meal of the winter.

But, if the beaver's portal to The Upside Down is an under-the-road wildlife passage, we're left with one last cliched puzzle to solve.

You do an about face and walk to the downstream side of the road to see the pipe outlet has been submerged by flooding. There's thick solid ice up to and covering the crown. The beaver couldn't enter the portal that way, and that is *why* the beaver ... you know. Ba dum 'tis.

You're so funny Jody.

A narrow sliver of a waning crescent moon illuminates the alien landscape beyond. There's probably thirty acres, all now protected by ice. The den exterior is rock hard too by now. Along the edges, a ring of century old hemlocks blacken the perimeter providing aerial cover (and habitat). It looks like the stands of deciduous trees are harvested in phases.

You step one foot out onto the ice. Not a peep pop or tong. It's seems thick. There's a whole world down there, with food in storage for a growing family. It's a home for a host of other creatures in suspended animation.

That's the way to be Jody. Certainly beats an old mound of crap.

Back in the car, you turn the key. The Legacy roars back with no oil light.

You release the parking break and feather the clutch to get enough momentum to escape the local minimum of the beaver's domain.

You wonder if you can take a train all the way to Monterey.

A computer simulation. More free school; free housing. Five grand ain't much, but what's the worst that could possibly happen?

You turn the radio on to hear: ""threatened trade sanctions in retaliation over Greenland in Davos"" ... and that's a NOPE.

You hit #4 to see if you can pickup Montreal off the ionosphere.

Et ""vous écoutes \[a bunch of static\]"" off a bit of a ionic reflection, but it's not enough.

You hit #5 for ""Dirt"" radio, and catch a singer song writer on her bridge:

>Hold your friends, forgive the night Die to love and live your life ...

'Dirt radio in a clutch', you think, as you sled your old Legacy closer toward a new resting place somewhere in the valley below.",1,1769520702.0,SuperlativeVermont,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I like chats that start easy and accidentally turn meaningful—usually somewhere between travel plans, food cravings, and wondering why sunsets hit harder when you actually stop to watch them.

I’m 28, South Indian, comfortably ambivert, and intentionally low-drama. I enjoy traveling and hiking (often turning “short walks” into mild adventures), play badminton on weekends with competitive enthusiasm and questionable technique, and unwind with sitcoms that feel like familiar company. I’m a foodie who believes meals are better when you don’t rush them. Movies are occasional, but good storytelling always wins.

I’m drawn to conversations with women probably someone older than me?  because there’s usually a calm confidence there that I genuinely enjoy—the kind that comes from knowing who you are and no longer needing to prove it. Conversations feel more relaxed, more honest, and often more playful in a quietly clever way. You tend to listen well, speak with intention, and bring perspective that turns everyday topics into something richer. There’s warmth without chaos, humor without trying too hard, and a refreshing sense of “this is me” that makes talking feel easy and real.

A few things worth knowing upfront:

- This is strictly platonic (no surprise plot twists later)
- I respect boundaries and expect the same
- I can be thoughtful and laugh at dumb things
- I value good energy, consistency, and curiosity
- Comfortable silences are not awkward here.

I’m not here to rush anything or force a connection. Just looking for conversations that feel natural—like a long coffee, a good walk, or a chat that makes you forget to check the time.",1,1769520375.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

After spending some time reading here and actually doing IF, I realized there’s more nuance that beginners (including past me) often miss.

First, fasting hours matter, but what you eat during your eating window still counts. IF didn’t magically cancel out overeating or poor food choices for me. I noticed much better results once I focused on protein, fiber, and not turning every meal into a binge just because the fast ended.

Second, hunger isn’t always real hunger. In the beginning, a lot of my “hunger” was just habit or boredom. Drinking water or black coffee helped me figure out the difference over time. That said, some days hunger is legit, and forcing a fast on those days didn’t feel sustainable.

Lastly, IF isn’t one-size-fits-all. 16:8 worked better for me than jumping straight into longer fasts. Flexibility made it easier to stick with long term.

We weren’t very close back then, but the interaction was friendly and polite.

The conversation started well; she responded openly and seemed friendly. She works as a nurse, currently doing many late and night shifts, and generally has a very busy schedule. I respected that and communicated accordingly.

After some back-and-forth, I casually asked if she would be interested in meeting up (coffee/walk, nothing formal, no pressure). She replied something along the lines of: *“I would like to, but I have very little free time right now because of night shifts.”*

I responded understandingly and suggested a rough time frame (the weekend), without insisting on a fixed date. Since then, it’s been almost 48 hours without a reply.

Meanwhile, she posted an Instagram story showing her doing a leisure activity, which has made me a bit unsure. I’m now wondering how to interpret this:

* Is this normal behavior for someone with a busy schedule/night shifts?
* Could this indicate disinterest?
* Should I follow up, or just let it be?

1qodmhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianTellyTalk/comments/1qodmhq/mahadev_and_son_detailed_storyline/,Mahadev and Son Detailed Storyline,"Someone on my earlier post asked for a more detailed Rajji–Dheeraj storyline, so I decided to make a separate post. This isn’t *only* about Rajji and Dheeraj — it’s a more detailed breakdown of the overall story, focusing on their arc.

I’ve watched the Telugu version, Illu Illalu Pillalu, and around 20 episodes of the original Tamil Pandian Stores 2. Based on that, this is Rajji and Dheeraj’s story as it played out in the Telugu version — and what will most likely happen in Mahadev & Sons.

Since today’s episode shows Bhanu talking to Narmada’s parents, this is the storyline from that point onward.

After Narmada’s father rejects Ketan’s proposal, Dheeraj decides to help Narmada and Ketan elope. On the day of the *sagai*, Dheeraj and Ketan stay near Narmada’s house so they can act quickly if she gets a chance to escape. Around the same time, Rajji and her friends are heading out, and she notices Dheeraj and Ketan standing nearby. She becomes suspicious and questions them, but Dheeraj manages to convince her that nothing is going on.

Eventually, Narmada and Ketan succeed in getting married, followed by the expected melodrama. Soon after, Rajji’s wedding is arranged. Vidya feels deliberately excluded from the preparations, so Mahadev sends Vidya, Narmada, and Dheeraj on a trip.

While they are away, Rajji’s boyfriend Kalyan manipulates her into running away with him. She takes all her jewellery, believing his promise that he will marry her. Coincidentally, Rajji and Kalyan end up staying at the same hotel as Vidya and Narmada. The next day, Kalyan abandons Rajji in the hotel room, steals her jewellery, and files a **false prostitution case** against her.

Dheeraj spots Kalyan, learns about the police case, and Vidya and Narmada urge him to help Rajji. To save her, Dheeraj sneaks into Rajji’s room through the window. Instead of helping her escape the same way, he ends up **marrying her** to protect her.

When they return home, the Bajpayee family — especially Bhanu — is deeply hurt. Viswa even tries to shoot Dheeraj, but Rajji steps in and defends him, claiming they were already in a relationship. The following day, Viswa comes again and gets into a physical fight with Dheeraj.

Later, Dheeraj goes to wake Rajji, who believes the previous night’s events were just a dream. Dheeraj reminds her that the marriage really happened and brings her coffee, marking the first quiet moment between them.

Soon after, everyone visits a temple where the Bajpayees are also present. Viswa secretly plans to have Dheeraj killed. During the visit, there are couples’ games, and Vidya and Narmada persuade Rajji and Dheeraj to participate. They end up winning. Later, Viswa’s men abduct Dheeraj and are about to kill him, but Rajji finds him in time. She threatens Viswa, saying that if they harm Dheeraj, she will slit her own throat. Viswa backs down, and Rajji rushes Dheeraj to the hospital, calling Ashish from Dheeraj’s phone.

Back home, Bhanu discovers that Rajji’s jewellery is missing and creates a huge scene. She files a police complaint against Mahadev, leading to his arrest. To secure Mahadev’s release, Rajji falsely confesses that she stole the jewellery herself and offers to be arrested instead. Bhanu withdraws the case, and Rajji and Dheeraj then work together to retrieve the jewellery from Kalyan and return it to Bhanu.

During this time, Vidya and Mahadev take Ashish to a speed-dating event, where he meets a girl they really like. In the Telugu version, her name is Srivalli. She appears to come from a wealthy family, but in reality, her parents are pretending — they actually run an idli stand. The marriage is arranged regardless.

Later, Kiran faints, and Rajji rushes to help, unknowingly crossing family boundaries. Viswa sees this and slaps her. Mahadev witnesses the incident and supports Rajji, leading to another massive fight in which Viswa even rips Mahadev’s shirt. When Ashish learns about this, he beats up Viswa. Viswa files a police complaint, resulting in Ashish’s arrest. Because of this chaos, Srivalli’s family cancels the engagement.

Rajji then files a complaint against Viswa. Eventually, Viswa withdraws his complaint, and Rajji withdraws hers as well. Srivalli’s family later returns, stating that Srivalli refuses to marry anyone else, and the wedding is back on.

Mahadev asks Dheeraj not to attend the *sagai* to avoid further drama, and Dheeraj agrees. At this point, Dheeraj is working as a water-can delivery boy. By coincidence, he is assigned to deliver water to his own brother’s engagement venue. Srivalli’s mother sees him there and humiliates him, but Rajji firmly stands up for Dheeraj, saying he earns honest money through hard work, effectively silencing her.

Later, during wedding shopping, Rajji is asked to choose a sari. She refuses unless Dheeraj buys it for her. She deliberately chooses a sari that he can afford.

Seeing everyone dressed lavishly, Kiran becomes insecure and secretly steals Rajji’s jewellery. After more wedding drama, Ashish and Srivalli get married.

At a *pooja* held at Srivalli’s parents’ house, Srivalli’s mother orders Rajji to do household chores. Dheeraj immediately stops her and tells Srivalli’s mother that Rajji was raised in a household where she didn’t even have to get out of bed for her morning coffee, that she doesn’t know such work, and that **he will do all the housework himself**.

After the wedding, Srivalli asks Ashish for ₹1 lakh. He takes a loan to give it to her. When debt collectors start harassing him, Ashish turns to Dheeraj for help. Dheeraj secretly takes ₹1 lakh from Mahadev’s account and gives it to Ashish. Later, Ashish returns the money, and Dheeraj is about to deposit it back when Mahadev finds out.

Mahadev and Ashish’s wife accuse Dheeraj of being a thief. Mahadev raises his hand to slap Rajji, but she stops him and firmly defends Dheeraj, telling Srivalli something along the lines of:

Previously, we stayed on the condado, and we wanted a change of scenery. 

I used suite night upgrades, and it was honored with confirmation before check in. The hotel facilities are quite nice, a bit dated, but overall the suite in which we were placed was really spacious and nice. I tend to like the boutique hotels in the Marriott family, as it gets a bit old being in the same cookie-cutter hotels when traveling for work. 

While the facilities were fine, the service was shockingly terrible. First, the check in/front desk line rarely was below 4-5 people, and it moves very slowly. When checking in, the room wasn’t ready. Which is fine, I’m happy to be a bit flexible; we grabbed a drink at the restaurant and enjoyed the view. But after nearly 2 hours, even checking regularly, the room was finally ready (checked in at a little after 4, got in our room at 6ish). 

I had arranged in advance with my ambassador representative to have amenities ready to celebrate my husband’s birthday, confirming what I wanted to include based on his preferences. When we got to the room, we found that none of the arrangement preferences were honored (a bowl of fruit was made available).

The second day, we were out exploring the city, and when we returned, the room wasn’t serviced. No problem, I chatted with the front desk via the app, and they assured me they would have it addressed. We return from dinner, and the room remained unserviced. We then had to wait in the lobby after dinner for an hour as they cleaned. 

Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was buffet style. Yet, we had an hour wait each morning simply to be seated, in a rather empty dining room; and our server was rarely seen and difficult to even contain coffee from. 

Overall, it seems like the hotel is more interested in turning over rooms for those with cruise departures rather than providing an experience that would be expected at a Tribute hotel. While the location is tempting, I recommend you stay at any other property in San Juan until they can adequately address the service quality. This seems more like an issue of management and staffing, which is localized to this particular hotel.

1qodhuh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qodhuh,Social Meetups & Speed Dating Experiences?,"So I’ve been in dire need of social interaction lately & the seasonal depression in Wisconsin ways heavily on my very own. It’s definitely the worst time to do this but surprisingly last week I had my first ever (& successful 😄) Timeleft dinner with complete strangers! I’ve been looking more into apps/events where you can just go to a location & meet up with people rather than subjecting myself to friend/dating apps. I just got back on the Bumble BFF app but am currently in the “talking phase” with a bunch of girlies. I find it’s also just very hard to make friends in your late 20s. 

I find this to be the same with dating apps where we are either stuck in the talking phase or it just doesn’t read as well as it does in real life (& i’m clearly over it). I’m very bubbly & extroverted where if I am out & about somewhere on the weekends - I strike up a conversation with strangers fairly well. I love meeting new people & am wanting to put myself out there this year & do things I’ve never done before.

I did see people recommend Milwaukee Sports & Social for events but also see they’re doing a Valentine’s Day speed dating. The only thing I’m bummed out about is that the range for women 25-39 is sold out since they cap at 35 singles of both men & women. I tend to date my age (27) & older versus younger so I was wondering if there are more speed dating dates for the future for them? As this brings me to the “Pre-Dating Speed Dating” event in Bayview - they have future dates already set in March for St. Patricks Day.

I do appreciate that Pre-Dating offers a wider age range of singles & notice they do a special “Lock & Key” event as well. Has anyone done either or & how was your experience with that? Also, if you didn’t have a match- did you still find the experience worth it? I was also thinking what if you don’t get any matches & either how awkward that be or possibly it still be a good experience since you pay a price for it (but that could be consider either good or bad).

Timeleft you pay the price for the subscription & then you pay for your own food & drinks- which is fine because you get access to dinner & coffee meetups for the entire month to connect with other like minded people. I was a bit anxiety ridden from watching TikToks about bad experiences but also remembered that the people I would be meeting are there for the exact same reason I am. So, I would figure the same as for speed dating events. 

I did also download the Meetup app since my psychiatrist surprisingly (not really cause she’s awesome) suggested it to me a couple months back & saw it was recommended by others. I did join a couple of groups & the “New Friends MKE” group is hosting a “Cheers to the New Years! Member Mix & Mingle” at St. Francis Brewery this Saturday. I thought I’d check it out & maybe do a Timeleft coffee meet up before it to get my social adrenaline already pumping through my veins. Also, I’d love to hear anyone’s experience through the Meetup app or recommendations for any groups for friends or dating.

I am such a yapper (please bear with me) but in conclusion is there any events socially for singles/dating or just wanting to make new friends in Milwaukee that you suggest or recommend that wasn’t listed? Otherwise if you’ve done any of the above what was your experience/if you would do it again or not? I really appreciate any feedback/recommendations - I’m really trying to put myself out there with this being a new year & new me. 😊",0,1769519636.0,milwaukee,0,0.4,False
1qodh0q,https://i.redd.it/ujkmpms66wfg1.jpeg,"Beyond the ""Anti-Triangle"": Why I’m building a manifesto for the ""Pre-Instagram"" soul of travel.","Hey everyone,

I recently posted about alternates to the ""Golden Triangle"" and the response was a massive wake-up call. It seems like a lot of us are feeling the same thing: Travel in India has become a checklist.

I’ve been traveling this country since before smartphones were in every pocket. I remember the literal physical sensation of discovering a hidden carved pillar in Tanjore or a specific sunlight-soaked hallway in a Chettinad mansion without having seen a ""Top 10"" Reel of it first. There was a magic in that discovery that social media has effectively killed. Everything feels like a spoiler now.

We are a group of dreamers building yume, and we’re trying to build a framework to reclaim that feeling. If the ""Anti-Triangle"" is about where we go, the Manifesto is about how we exist when we get there.

We’ve boiled it down to a few ""rules"" I’m testing on my next trip to Tamil Nadu in January -

The 50/50 Architecture: I’m booking my stays and trains (stability), but leaving 50% of every day as ""The Void."" No Google Maps, no Zomato reviews. Just walking until I find the smell of good filter coffee.

Digital Celibacy (The No-Spoiler Rule): I’ve stopped looking at photos of Madurai or Rameshwaram. I want the scale of the Meenakshi Temple to hit me in person, not as a second-hand version of a photo I’ve already liked.

Seeking ""Local Friction"": I’m avoiding the ""Express Check-in"" hotels. I’m staying in heritage homes where I have to talk to the family. Friction is where the stories happen; convenience is where memories go to die.

The Deep Observation Anchor: Instead of 10 temples in a day, I’m picking one corner of one temple and sitting there for a full hour. No camera. Just watching the light change on the granite and sketching .

I’m curious - especially for those who remember travel in the 90s or early 2000s: Is it possible to actually ""discover"" India anymore? Or are we just checking off boxes in a pre-rendered simulation?

I’d love to hear your thoughts on these pillars. Are they too ""slow"" for the reality of Indian travel, or is this exactly what we need to stop the burnout?

I’m writing this from Minnesota.

These are just a few things that may not be making the national or international news.

a beloved local donut shop Glam Doll Donuts across the street from where Alex Pretti died turned into a warming house and medic center for protestors building and maintaining the memorial site.

a 70yo independent bookstore owner DreamHaven Books down the street expressed his pain on camera, walked through a tear gas cloud, and his website crashed less than 24 hours later from too much business and donations.

the day after tear gas bombs destroyed a N-Mpls neighborhood sending a 6mo old baby to the hospital, at daybreak, a small church community cleaned up the mess of pepper balls, tear gas containers and trash so the neighbors didn’t have to wake up to the memories.

a local independent journalist Mercado Media pounding the streets everyday reporting things from the ground had a testicle removed and showed up two days later to walk with 75,000+ community members to walk the streets in -20 degree weather.

a local sex-positive adult-store The Smitten Kitten has completely transformed into a donation and distribution center.

a local pizza place Wrecktangle Pizza  raised over $83K in less than a few days to support families that are sheltering in place.

tow-truck companies are donating their services to clean up the accidents and abandoned vehicles left by ICE and the city is waiving impound fees.

local multi-faith spiritual leaders are spearheading sit-ins at corporate headquarters such as Target and USBank to have deeper conversations with CEOs and boards of directors about community relief.

social workers are taking in children who came home from school with both their parents “disappeared.”

animal shelters and pet-fostering agencies are rescuing pets left alone for days or weeks after their humans were detained.

every restaurant, church, karate dojo, dance studio, school, barber shop, and other small business has created their own underground grassroots supportive network to protect their neighbors, get people to and from work, and raise funds to pay everyday bills.

women who are moms and work full-time jobs are donning reflective vests in shifts to stand watch at bus stops, city parks, and grocery store parking lots ini sub-zero temps to bear witness before going home to tuck their babies in at night.

the MN National Guard offered donuts, coffee, and hot cocoa to peaceful protesters the day after Alex Pretti died, reminding community that we are all in this together and they are here to keep the peace.

Quick maintenance question for those using Baratza grinders.

How often do you replace the rubber gasket/seal where the grounds pass through? Mine is starting to hold a lot of coffee residue and I’m wondering if that’s normal wear or a sign it’s time to change it.

Also is it normal for the hopper to move slightly when the grinder starts running? Mine has a bit of play and I’m not sure if that’s expected behavior or something worth tightening/checking.

# Giffey a primitive with eye for detail

**By Madeline Tourtelot**

David Giffey has come by way of journalism into a fantasy world of exquisite primitive painting. Every tree is bejewelled with colorful pattern. Stepping stone pathways lead through immaculate flower-covered fields perfectly in balance. The orchestration of color harmonies is sheer delight. Small figures from other worlds wearing intriguing attire are joyfully and surprisingly ‘on their way’ on a beautiful animal or driving in an imagined chariot. His people are actively doing things in a never-never world of fun and beauty. There always seems to be a castle in the distance. There always seems to be a large red sun, a silver moon, or both. You can wander far and happily in David Giffey’s meticulously executed paintings.

[PAINTER DAVID GIFFEY](https://preview.redd.it/0slpqxj9qrfg1.png?width=1410&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf32de3cf1010654dc80aa36958b3289c378da76)

A gentle person with a quiet smile, David has made his summer studio in Door county out of a chicken coop on an abandoned farm. It is a quiet and peaceful place to work, and he finds diversions in collecting wild strawberries, which he preserves, and growing herbs.

Giffey’s people were educators and farmers from Fond du Lac, originally from Ireland and Germany. He attended a one room schoolhouse and received elementary education training at Oshkosh State.

At the end of the beatnik generation David was living in North Beach near San Francisco after a year’s hitch-hike in 1962 from Florida to California. This was a time of coffee houses, new freedom for young people, jazz and poetry. He lived across from Sugar Hill, where David recalls lying in bed as he listened to such then-famous musicians as Carmen MacRae and the Keanes. Painter friends, galleries and museums began to stimulate his visual perceptions although he had envisioned himself as a writer. (He worked for eight years as a journalist as a wire editor, and front page make-up man.)

Drafted, he was sent to Vietnam where he worked as assistant editor of the Division newspaper, and as a cameraman. While in the area, David managed a trip to Japan. “Asians have a penchant for detail in their art”, he said, and explained that this was probably the force behind his own sense of detail. He wants to return someday to the Orient for further study.

When he returned from Vietnam he took a job with the Post Crescent in Appleton where, for one year, he covered general assignments with emphasis on politics. In ’67 he moved to Wautoma, the center of the farm workers Union, and ran a newspaper in Spanish for the farm workers there (mostly from Texas). From ’67 to ’69 he was a political reporter for ‘The Paper’ and later, correspondent for the Fox Valley Journal. Later on he went to McAllen, Tex., to produce a paper for the farmers in the Rio Grande valley.

Soon after, in Austin, David started to draw in pen and ink, large posters and geometric designs. Fortunately for artists there was a place called “The Drag” which was a permanent market for the selling of arts and crafts. His work started to sell and he was able to continue painting by working on a concrete construction job. On the outside of a pool hall in the Chicano district, he painted a 7 foot by 14 foot mural which brought him sign painting jobs and more free time for his painting.

David has had successful one-man shows with more to come. He plans to spend the summer working in Door county. He is on his way as an unusually fine ‘primitive’ painter. Several of his paintings can be seen at the Edgewood Orchard Galleries near Fish Creek.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

With one smooth motion, procedurally ingrained by years of repetition, he shuts off the alarm. His body initiates the exit from bed before any enthusiasm arrives.

He is tired, not physically, but mentally. Tired of watching himself enact the same habits, the same workday, the same bland 3-in-1 coffee every morning. More tired still when he notices he is already moving toward the kitchen, about to pour the very drink he despises.

The smell of coffee cues a childhood memory. His mother, eventually yielding to his insistence, letting him taste hers once. He remembers the bitterness, the immediate dislike. Standing now with the mug in his hand, he wonders when that aversion was overwritten, how repetition succeeded where preference failed.

He peels open the cigarette pack one-handed, extracts one with his teeth, the motion precise enough to resemble sleight of hand, and steps outside to smoke his morning into place.

On the porch, coffee cooling in his hand and cigarette burning down between his fingers, Dave noticed a police cruiser stopped outside his neighbor’s house. Two officers stood at the door. The first knock was measured. 
The second louder. On the third, the door opened, and Dave could hear clearly.

“Officer Jake Cully, and my colleague Dean Hephner. Police Department,” the officer announced, his voice practiced and unyielding. “We are here to speak with Mr. Sean Polskay. Is he home?”

“Yes, this is him,” Polskay replied, his voice restrained, uncertain. “What is this about?”

“Sir,” the second officer said, tone flat and precise, “yesterday, between the hours of fourteen hundred and fourteen thirty, did you experience anger toward your supervisor, Mr. Dudley Fischer?” He paused briefly. “I will remind you that, based on your behavioral history, you are currently classified as a potential risk. Any attempt at deception will elevate that classification to high risk and result in immediate detainment.”

“How could I lie,” Polskay answered, irritation leaking through his composure, “when my brain has already selected my response before I am aware of it?” He swallowed. “According to my record, I have never acted violently toward anyone. My risk status should have been downgraded three years ago.”

“Please answer the question, Mr. Polskay,” Officer Cully said now, his voice rising. “Did you, or did you not, become angry at your boss?”

“If I did,” Polskay said quickly, “then it was unavoidable. My amygdala developed this way due to prenatal exposure; my mother drank a glass of wine during her seventh month. This was established by the Brain Analysis Directorate.” His hands trembled as he produced a folded document. “I have the certificate. I cannot help it.”

The officers exchanged a brief glance.
“In that case,” Cully replied, “the certificate is irrelevant. While your condition may explain the response, it does not negate the risk. Unpredictability, regardless of origin, constitutes a threat to public stability.” He stepped forward. “You are hereby restrained non-judgmentally and will be placed in protective holding for the foreseeable future.”

They moved quickly. Efficiently. Polskay barely had time to protest before he was forced into the back of the cruiser. The door shut. The car pulled away.

Dave stood frozen, coffee untouched, cigarette extinguished at last. He felt strangely relieved that he had stepped outside when he did, as though chance itself had granted him a small exemption.

1qod1q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/coparenting/comments/1qod1q2/struggling_with_coparenting/,Struggling with co-parenting,"I’ve been with my new partner for nearly a year and he moved into my house about 4 months ago. Most of the time things are good, but when they’re bad it usually centres around my co-parenting situation with my ex.

My ex is quite dependent on me and my family, and our communication does sometimes go beyond just logistics about our daughter. I know this isn’t ideal, but it’s how things have been and I’ve found it hard to suddenly change without it affecting everyone.

My new partner struggles with this a lot. Certain things trigger him and make him feel insecure or unsupported. When he tells me, I often feel defensive because I don’t always understand why it affects him so much, which then makes things escalate.

For example, on a day when my ex was meant to have our daughter, I decided to pick her up and take her out because I missed her and I wasn’t working that day. I told my partner I was at the park with her, but I didn’t explain beforehand how that came about. He felt I should have told him in advance.

Another situation that caused a lot of upset was when my ex came round to my house to get his hair checked for nits and for me to treat it. This was just before my partner moved in. At the time I didn’t see it as a big deal because it was practical and about hygiene, but my partner felt it crossed a line, especially with my ex being in the house.

I also once suggested meeting my ex for a coffee to talk about our daughter (it didn’t actually happen), but when my partner found out later, it caused another argument.

From my point of view these things feel small and situational. From his point of view they feel like a pattern of me not setting firm boundaries and not being fully open about what’s happening.

I’m genuinely trying to understand where the line should be — what’s reasonable co-parenting, what goes too far, and how I can support my partner without feeling like I’m constantly doing something wrong.

Am I minimising something important here, or are we just fundamentally different in how we view boundaries?

I didnt know what to do a jolt of lightning struck me. I wanted to cry but my eyes wouldnt allow me to. I wanted to scream but my lungs wouldnt allow me to. All there was left was pain. she thinks that feeding me sandwiches and coffee will help with pain but with every bite and every sip i could feel my balls ache. It still hurts.

All the forces of God and man li⁠⁠ned up to ensure that this would not happen. The Butthole Surfers themselves were active conspirators in their own obscurity from the very moment that they chose the name ""Butthole Surfers."" For the longest time, the Butthole Surfers operated as a semi-successful institution precisely by being the kind of band who could not get played on alternative rock radio. Their music was frantic and ugly and quite often intentionally unlistenable. Instead, they made their name as a fucked-up circus act that would roll through town every so often and get banned from venues by setting shit on fire. This was the path that they chose in life. It's why people loved them.

In '80s underground rock circles, the Butthole Surfers' live show was the stuff of legend. Strobe lights went off incessantly. Dry ice billowed all through the room. Two drummers flailed away at stand-up kits while evil murk-wallow riffs filled the air and a big, scary fucker heaved beer cans directly at people's heads. Over the years, things got more elaborate. A naked woman with a shaved head and a psychedelically painted body danced ecstatically, and grisly medical films were projected over the band. There were stories about one particular clip — medical footage of a guy getting penis reconstruction surgery after an accident involving farm equipment — that would cause people to pass out or throw up. A Butthole Surfers live show was an experience. You didn't go for the music.

They did make music, though. In their glory years, the Butthole Surfers were creatures of the underground, and they gave their albums dada potty-humor titles like Rembrandt Pussyhorse. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, they insisted that they wanted to make money. They laughed at the notion of punk rock community. When the Nirvana phenomenon happened and a major label shoved a contract their way, they eagerly signed. But a major-label contract couldn't turn the Butthole Surfers into a radio band. Even with the assistance of an actual rock legend, the best that they could manage was a deranged riff-rock anthem that got minimal airplay. When the post-Nirvana signing rush ended, that should've been curtains. Instead, the Butthole Surfers stumbled ass-backwards into the biggest alternative rock radio hit of 1996. Whether accidentally or not, they landed on the kind of approachably edgy weirdo novelty sound of that moment, at least for one song.

The song is good. Does that matter? I think it matters. You could have a great time telling the saga of the Butthole Surfers without acknowledging that the song was good. You could make fun of them as fluke one-hit wonders who used up all their underground goodwill, as if they weren't happily doing that in the first place. You could talk about all the utterly lame shit that they did before or after the one hit. But none of that extra context turns the one hit into anything other than a good song.

Honestly, I think the one-off success of ""Pepper"" is a pretty good coda for the Butthole Surfers' story. For so many years, these guys were all in love with trash culture; they were doing it in Texas. They reacted to the perceived stupidity of everything around them by transforming themselves into a deranged funhouse-mirror exaggeration of that stupidity, reinventing scuzz-rock quasi-stardom as perverse carnival-barker performance art. Then they had one hit that was just big enough to ensure that they would become part of trash culture themselves. It makes sense. It wasn't supposed to happen, but maybe it's what needed to happen.

The Butthole Surfers might have the best chapter of the absolutely essential Michael Azerrad book Our Band Could Be Your Life, even if that chapter slowly becomes a repetitive parade of unbelievable but probably half-true shit/piss/vomit stories. Our Band Could Be Your Life tells the story of the '80s underground through its bios of 13 extremely important bands. Some of those bands actively sought commercial success or at least stability, while others were happy to remain on their own cultural islands. Only one of those bands, the Replacements, has ever appeared in this column.

By 1996, the Replacements were long gone, having broken up too early to take any advantage of the commercial explosion of alternative rock. The same was true of plenty of the other bands in the book. The ones that were still around had their audiences, but they'd mostly accepted the idea that they were never going to become stars. Sonic Youth or Fugazi could play to huge crowds, but they weren't getting rich. The Butthole Surfers probably didn't get rich, either. but they did end up getting a whole mess of radio play thanks to a halfassed experiment — and, again, a good song — that sounded like Beck at a moment when alternative radio stations really wanted more music that sounded like Beck. But we'll get to that. First off, let's speed-run our way through the band's squalid backstory.

Lead Butthole Surfer Gibby Haynes grew up in Dallas, where his father was a locally famous kids' TV host known as Mr. Peppermint. Guitarist Paul Leary is from San Antonio, where his father taught accounting at Trinity University. Haynes and Leary went to Trinity at the same time, and Haynes, the captain of the school's D3 basketball team, became one of Leary's father's star students. Even then, though, both Haynes and Leary were into some freak shit.

Before they made music together, Haynes and Leary published a zine called Strange VD, which included pictures of some of the strangest, most upsetting medical photos they could find. After college, Haynes got a job at an accounting firm, but legend has it that he lost it after accidentally leaving one of his fucked-up medical photos in the work copy machine. Leary dropped out of his MBA program to move to California with Haynes, and then they came back to San Antonio and started making confrontational pisstake music, playing their first show at an art gallery and using different band names for every performance. Our Band Could Be Your Life immortalizes some of those one-off band names, including Nine Inch Worm Makes Its Own Food and the Inalienable Right To Eat Fred Astaire's Asshole. They did not have a lot of fans.

The Butthole Surfers chose the ""Butthole Surfers"" band name when someone accidentally used it while introducing one of their performances. (In fairness, they did have a song called ""Butthole Surfers."") Haynes and Leary found a rhythm section, brothers named Quinn and Scott Matthews, and they set out for California, where they thought they might find more receptive audiences. That didn't happen at first, but Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra caught a San Francisco show, loved it, and took the band under his wing. The Buttholes opened for the Dead Kennedys, and they put out a couple of extremely janky noise-rock EPs on Biafra's Alternative Tentacles label in 1983 and 1984.

Soon enough, the Matthews brothers quit the Butthole Surfers, and the band again moved back to San Antonio, a city that didn't really have much of a punk scene yet. Teenage hardcore drummer King Coffey caught an early set and became a Butthole when his band broke up, and an Austin art musician named Teresa Taylor, then known as Teresa Nervosa, joined up and became their second drummer soon thereafter. If you've seen Richard Linklater's Slacker, Taylor is the lady on the poster, the motormouth who tries to sell Madonna's pap smear. (Linklater, as it happens, was the first film projectionist for the Buttholes' live shows.) The band had a bunch of bassists, most of whom stuck around for little while and then got sick of all the chaos around them. Leary also had a pet pitbull named Mark Farner Of Grand Funk Railroad, who was always with them on tour and who was sometimes listed as a member of the band.

After a couple of Alternative Tentacles releases, the Butthole Surfers moved to Touch And Go Records, a label that was first based in Michigan and then Chicago. The label, run by Necros bassist Corey Rusk and his wife Lisa, started out releasing early hardcore records from bands like Negative Approach and the Meatmen, and it eventually became the world's greatest source for the kind of guttural, sardonic noise-rock that the Butthole Surfers made. The Rusks learned about the Buttholes through punk tape-trading networks, and they were fascinated. For long stretches over the next few years, the Buttholes, a band who no permanent residence, would crash with the Rusks in Chicago while setting up their DIY tours.

The Butthole Surfers' full-length debut Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac came out on Touch And Go at the end of 1984, and they cranked out another four LPs in fairly quick succession. The Buttholes produced themselves, and they specialized in a kind of noisy, bugged-out clatter. Haynes shrieked like a maniac and used studio effects to twist his voice into unrecognizable shapes, and his bandmates surrounded him with ecstatically ugly acid-fried riffage. Some of their songs were basically sneery parodies of classic rock nuggets from the Guess Who or Black Sabbath.

If you go back and listen to old Buttholes records, you will hear some absolutely sick wild-eyed noise-punk bangers, tracks that don't have memorable hooks but that might make you want to break cinderblocks over your own head, and you'll also hear some of the most annoying bullshit that you ever heard in your life. That's just how they were. Nothing was serious. Everything was an opportunity to fuck around. The best opportunities to fuck around were the live shows, where Gibby Haynes would gobble-howl through a megaphone and light cymbals on fire.

Over the years, those live shows earned the Butthole Surfers a reputation. People might go see them live even if they didn't like the music, just because they knew they'd get to see something. Lots of the alt-rock stars of the early '90s had their minds blown at Butthole Surfers shows. Kurt Cobain loved them. So did Eddie Vedder, who must've wore the same Butthole Surfers shirt at a million shows when Pearl Jam were touring behind Ten. I remember being a little kid flipping through metal magazines, coming across pictures of Vedder, and wondering why his shirt said ""Butthole."" This wasn't making the Buttholes any money, but there's real appeal in being the freakiest freaks in a whole world of freaky freaks. They leaned into their own outsized characters.

Eventually, Teresa Taylor left the Butthole Surfers after suffering an aneurysm. She'd been dealing with seizures that might've been brought on by the band's strobe-light abuse. She suffered health problems the rest of her life, and in 2023 she passed away from lung disease at the age of 60. After Taylor's departure, the remaining band members moved into a group house outside of Austin. When the UK press fell in love with the Buttholes, they left Touch And Go for the London label Rough Trade. There, they released one album, 1991's piouhgd, and a bunch of side-project records before the label went bankrupt. The Buttholes even got some college-radio and late-night MTV burn for their intentionally shitty cover of Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man."" A few years later, it was on the Dumb And Dumber soundtrack for some reason.

The Butthole Surfers made some actual moves in 1991. That's when they joined the first Lollapalooza tour, playing right after openers Rollins Band and freaking out the other acts by firing a shotgun onstage. They also trashed Nine Inch Nails' tour bus on camera. (Nine Inch Nails will eventually appear in this column. The Rollins Band's highest-charting Modern Rock hit, 1992's ""Low Self Opinion,"" peaked at #25.) That same year, Gibby Haynes recorded the berserk rockabilly vocals on Ministry's industrial metal head-crusher ""Jesus Built My Hotrod,"" a song that I probably like better than any Butthole Surfers track. (""Jesus Built My Hotrod"" peaked at #19 in 1992. Ministry's highest-charting Modern Rock hit is the even better ""N.W.O,"" which reached #11 that same year.)

In the wake of Lollapalooza and ""Jesus Built My Hotrod,"" not to mention the whole Nirvana situation, Capitol offered the Butthole Surfers a deal. They were sick of living in vans, and they jumped at it. Capitol paired them up with a new producer: John Paul Jones, from motherfucking Led Zeppelin. He's the least famous member of Led Zeppelin, but he's still from Led Zeppelin. Jones produced the Buttholes' 1993 major-label debut Independent Worm Saloon, easily the best Buttholes album in my book. I have vivid memories of encountering their single ""Who Was In My Room Last Night?"" and having my wig peeled back. Beavis And Butt-Head loved that one, too. They didn't even really make jokes about the video. They just endorsed it. The song became the Buttholes' first entry on the Modern Rock chart, where it peaked at #24.

Independent Worm Saloon did about as well commercially as a Butthole Surfers album called Independent Worm Saloon could reasonably be expected to do, but it didn't cross over. Jeff Pinkus, who'd been the band's steadiest-ever bassist for a few years, left shortly thereafter. Gibby Haynes had serious issues with cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. He moved out to LA and joined Johnny Depp and Flea in a side project called P. They released one instantly forgotten major-label album in 1995, but their real legacy is that River Phoenix overdosed and died outside one of their shows at the Viper Room, the club that Depp owned, in 1993.

Paul Leary started producing records for bands like the Meat Puppets and the Supersuckers. (The Meat Puppets' biggest radio alt-rock hit is ""Backwater,"" which peaked at #11 in 1994. That's a Leary production.) Around the same time, the Buttholes also launched into an extended legal battle with Touch And Go over the rights to their old records. They eventually won the lawsuit, and the label mostly stopped releasing new music shortly afterward. In the process, the Buttholes destroyed any of the underground goodwill that they had left. If the major-label thing didn't work out, they couldn't exactly go back home again.

Electriclarryland, the Butthole Surfers' second Capitol album, came out in 1996. Paul Leary co-produced it with Steve Thompson, an industry veteran whose random-ass list of credits somehow includes both Natalie Cole and Korn. For the most part, Electriclarryland is a fun, unhinged hard rock album that's still a whole lot more hinged than the band's old records. It also has by far the ugliest, most repellent cover art of any Butthole Surfers album, which is saying something. If you spent enough time flicking through used-CD bins in the late '90s, then you saw that clip-art pencil sticking into that clip-art ear way too many times.

Nothing else on Electriclarryland really sounds like ""Pepper,"" the song that became the Butthole Surfers' one random-ass hit. Nothing else in the band's discography sounds much like it, either. The song opens with a lysergic oscillating drone before a dusty looped breakbeat kicks in. Breakbeats like that were all over alt-rock radio in 1996. Two years after Beck's ""Loser"" conquered the airwaves, that kind of breakbeat was all the rage, usually paired with deadpan non-sequitur quasi-rap vocals and psychedelic guitar effects.

Beck himself was still making that kind of thing in 1996. He was doing it better than anyone else, and he was rewarded for his efforts. That year's best-reviewed album was Beck's big follow-up Odelay. It sold millions, and a couple of its singles were in heavy alt-rock rotation. (The biggest of them was ""Where It's At,"" which peaked at #5. It's a 7.) But a bunch of other songs that adapted the Beck playbook did even better and became quasi-novelty hits. This column will soon cover a bunch of songs that fit that basic mold.

In interviews, the Butthole Surfers insisted that they weren't ripping off Beck. They'd been messing around with tape loops since long before ""Loser,"" and they claimed that they were really more interested in trip-hop stuff like Massive Attack and Tricky. But Gibby Haynes had been at Beck's first SXSW show and told Beck, ""Man that was the best fucking thing I’ve ever seen!"" (That's per a 1999 SPIN cover story on Beck.) In any case, Haynes delivers all his ""Pepper"" verses in a slackjawed rhythmic mutter that he wasn't really using pre-Beck. Also, there's one chorus played backwards, just like the one on ""Loser."" The Buttholes are not beating the ripoff allegations that easily.

But I liked most of the Beck ripoffs that were getting airplay in 1996, and ""Pepper"" is no exception. In a way, the song presents the Butthole Surfers' freeform nothing-matters sensibility in a way that actually made sense on the radio, which is its own kind of minor miracle. In his verse, Haynes rattles off a series of disconnected character-sketch anecdotes about people who were all in love with dying and doing it in Texas. Apparently, most of their names belonged to people who Haynes knew in high school or on the early Texas punk scene, but we don't hear much emotional connection from Haynes. Instead, we hear about all these sad fates in quick, detached succession, like we're flipping through cable channels.

Mostly, the people of ""Pepper"" do not sound like people who you would like to know. Mikey had a facial scar. Bobby was a racist. Tommy played piano like a kid out on the rain, and then he lost his leg in Dallas; he was dancing with a train. Pauly caught a bullet, but it only hit his leg. Well, it should've been a better shot, caught him in the head. The one line about the ""ever-present football player rapist"" is extra-jarring now, but it ranks pretty low in the history of Butthole Surfers shock-value stunts. In any case, ""Pepper"" is not a tale of karmic justice. We don't learn anything else about this ever-present football-player rapist. It's just scary to be told that he's out there.

On the chorus, the whirling psychedelic guitars kick in, and Haynes snaps out of his quasi-rap trance. He goes into a different trance instead, breaking into a baritone chant: ""I don't mind the sun sometimes, the images it shows!"" Gothy synth-plunks find their way into the mix, and everything seems to swirl up around Haynes' voice. The choruses and verses don't have much to do with each other, but you never know just how you look through other people's eyes. Like Folk Implosion's ""Natural One,"" another underground band's Beck-esque diversion that became a freak radio hit, ""Pepper"" unfolds according to its own logic and creates its own ominous but ecstatic vibe. You don't really know what's going on, but it's a cool place to spend five minutes. (""Natural One"" peaked at #5 in 1995. It's a 10.)

The ""Pepper"" video, which got surprising levels of MTV play, finds ways to riff on both the Kennedy assassination and the Manson Family murders without getting too obvious about either of them. In newreel-style black-and-white footage, a mob of cowboy-hatted cops, including CHiPS star Erik Estrada, catch the Butthole Surfers at a motel room and arrest them, with Gibby Haynes obliviously lip-syncing his lyrics to the newscasters who ask him for comment. We flash between those scenes and shots of the band playing a surreal variety show a lot like the one from Nirvana's ""In Bloom"" video. Just like the song, the ""Pepper"" video offered a lot of surreal spectacle while still matching the cultural moment. This was the first and last time that the Butthole Surfers would manage that.

""Pepper"" didn't do much business outside the alt-rock world, only reaching #26 on the Mainstream Rock chart. Electriclarryland went gold, and none of its other songs got any attention. Critics didn't take the single or the album seriously, and maybe that's a side effect of all those years the Buttholes didn't take themselves seriously. Later in 1996, Rolling Stone ran a long profile of the Buttholes, who were utterly depressed and burnt-out while on an endless European tour. Paul Leary's dog and mother had both died just as ""Pepper"" took off, and he was done: ""I just hate it when somebody congratulates me for having a #1 song on the Modern Rock charts or something. Just get me the fuck out of here.""

The Butthole Surfers recorded another album called After The Astronaut that was supposed to come out in 1998, and the band even sent out advances to press, but Capitol canceled the release. I wonder how that happened. Capitol signed the band when they were anarchic underground noisemakers, and the label stuck with them even after Independent Worm Saloon didn't sell. After they made a hit, the label should've logically been behind them more, not less. That's not how it worked out, though. Maybe they pissed too many people off — not in a ""freaking out the squares"" sense but in a ""these people are upsetting to be around"" sense. More often than not, those two things are the same thing.

The band split from Capitol and remained in between-labels limbo for a few years before they found a deal with the Disney-owned Hollywood Records, which feels like the last label that should release a Butthole Surfers record. In 2001, five years after ""Pepper,"" the Butthole Surfers finally came out with another LP called Weird Revolution. It was their last. Lead single ""The Shame Of Life"" made it to #24 on the Modern Rock chart. That song sucks. It's a transparent attempt to make another ""Pepper,"" except way sleazier and way more produced, and it's got a hook that motherfucking Kid Rock wrote for the band. There was a whole backstory for that.

Way back in 1992, Kid Rock was just coming off his brief moment as a post-Vanilla Ice major label white rapper and trying to remake himself as an underground rap-rock cult hero. He sampled ""Sweat Loaf,"" the Butthole Surfers' deranged 1987 Black Sabbath bite, on a track called ""Pancake Breakfast."" Then Kid Rock unexpectedly became a giant star in the late-'90s rap-metal moment, and I guess the Butthole Surfers found out about that sample. Instead of suing him, they got him to write that chorus. I get mad whenever I hear about a sampling lawsuit, but they should've sued him instead. (Kid Rock's highest-charting Modern Rock hit is ""Cowboy,"" which peaked at #5 in 1999, and I'm sorry to report that it's an 8.)

The Butthole Surfers weren't really a functional band when they released Weird Revolution. The album got terrible reviews and was otherwise ignored, and the Buttholes just kind of farted out. They've only been intermittently active since then. There was a reunion tour with Jeff Pinkus and Teresa Nervosa in 2008, a coffee table book in 2019, a live album in 2025. A documentary called The Hole Truth And Nothing Butt played at some festivals last year. I bet that's a fun watch. At one of those fests, the Buttholes played a surprise set, their first performance in eight years. They only did three songs. Last month, they got an illogical-ass namecheck and needledrop on the second-to-last Stranger Things episode. Stuff like that will probably keep happening every so often, whenever a new generation learns that it's fun to say ""Butthole Surfers"" out loud. I don't know if it'll have much effect on the band's legacy.

I never caught a Butthole Surfers live show. I was supposed to go to one. Had tickets and everything. They were coming to the Capitol Ballroom in DC with fellow Texan bands the Toadies and the Rev. Horton Heat, and I showed up at the venue to find that there was no one there. Someone yelled to me that the show was canceled. Pre-internet, sometimes you just had to find out that way. But how did everyone else find out? Why was I the only one there? Life has many mysteries.

I don't remember when that canceled show was, but it was probably around the time of ""Pepper,"" and I probably wouldn't have gotten the fabled fucked-up spectacle of a Butthole Surfers show anyway. Those days were done. Once upon a time, those live shows made a huge impression on a whole lot of people.

We’re currently living in Manila, and in mid-March we’ll be making an overseas trip. Before that though, we fancy a change of scene.

We’ve travelled a lot recently and are a bit weary of bouncing around, so we’re not looking to hop from place to place. Instead, we’d love somewhere we can properly bed down for a while - a place with a nice vibe, decent amenities (a few good coffee shops, restaurants, that sort of thing), and enough nearby that we could rent a bike or scooter and do little day trips or excursions - ideally, somewhere within reach of the coast. 

Given where we’ve travelled to this last year, we’d probably be most interested in Mindoro, Palawan, Panay, Negros, Cebu….that sort of band.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a comfortable place to live for 6 weeks where we get a short term rental?

Should I go or save money?

Coorg has no shortage of places to stay homestays, mid-range resorts and a few high end plantation properties. Since this was very special trip for me so I decided to give try to plantation resort and see if it really lived up to the hype.

What surprised me was how different the experience felt from a regular hotel. Waking up to mist walking through coffee plantations in morning and not feeling rushed at that stay feel slower and more intentional. The villa we stayed in was designed around local architecture, and felt private enough that we didn’t feel like we were in a crowded resort.

The resort also have organized small experiences like plantation walks and village visits. Normally I skip these, but in Coorg they actually helped us understand the place better especially the coffee culture.

Yes, it was little expensive But meals were included, service was consistently good and we didn’t feel the need to step out or spend extra money. In that sense it felt like we were paying for the experience, not just the room.

For anyone planning a Coorg trip, I’d say this:

If it’s a special occasion or your first visit give a try to plantation resort can feel worth it

If budget is tight, Coorg’s homestays still offer great views and warmth at lower cost

Prices jump a lot during weekends so planning early really matters

Overall, I don’t think there’s a “best” place for everyone it really depends on what kind of trip you want and slowing down in a plantation setting was exactly what I needed. Evolve Back was the Coorg",1,1769517712.0,u_Legal-Package-3210,0,1.0,False

\- how did you even think of using albuterol? That drug will kill you! We don't even prescribe it anymore! (I'm not in the US. My GP gave it to me. I was just happy to breathe and not really trying to freak myself out more by looking at what it's gonna do to me). Oh yes, and she didn't prescribe anything else. At least before my ALEX2 comes through. But I love scolding a patient for something they had no choice on, and then giving them NOTHING to replace it.

\- are you sure you're sick? You look so good and spry. (Maybe it's cause you cancelled the first meeting and I had to wait for two weeks on low histamine diets and claritin, wonder why I'm better??)

\- you just need to stress less (this one sends me into hysteria.)

\-H2 blockers? No, they rebound very badly. Not recommended. Go see a stomach doctor. It's just some acid.

\- so what if you have to never eat histamines again? Just take some DAO, although it's super expensive and maybe you can't buy it in this country. And then proceeds to say how she had to quit sugar and coffee and other things for a brief while and it wasn't so bad, and that OTHER PEOPLE have to go on celiac diets with no traces (somehow forgetting that ten minutes ago I told her I'm on a celiac diet with no traces...)



Sigh. I paid 100€ out of pocket to be made fun of. (It would have been even worse if I waited six months for a government paid free gaslighting session, though.)

  
My country does not have any mast cell stabilisers approved. I have to import DAO. A certified allergist has never heard of MCAS and thinks I'm a basket case.

So what else is new, I guess.

This doctor came recommended by my good endobiogeny doctor. As a great specialist in the field. The endobiogeny doctor is the only doctor who hasn't treated me like trash, so I trusted her opinion.

Every time we saw each other, we smiled and made eye contact. There was mutual flirting and playful teasing. We both liked it. We talked in person and looked for excuses to chat — I asked her for help with a test, and she later asked me for advice on a purchase. 

We were in different groups and only shared some classes. On optional lectures, she’d often sign me in. We rarely met outside class, and there was no natural moment to ask her out one-on-one.

Once covid hit, we studied from home. Still flirting, smile and heart reactions but mostly college topics. We rarely talked about other things. She seems more comfortable in person than texting. When in-person classes returned, we switched to part-time and only met every two weekends. The chemistry was still there, but even fewer chances to meet.

After graduation, we had two years of silence. I reached out, and she was happy and enthusiastic — once she even said it was cute and nice of me to ask how she was doing. She replied slower since it was during work hours, but she was subtly sarcastic about our college days, so she clearly remembered them. However she seemed busy and didn’t extend the conversation much.

I almost stopped at this point, but decided to ask her out for coffee. She was more than enthusiastic and said sure, she wants to meet me. Her schedule was full with work and sports but I felt she really wants to fit me in it. Finally we set a time and she sent a heart. I also knew she was leaving the city for a couple of days shortly after.

Closer to the date, she wrote that she work overhours and don't know if she can make it and maybe we can move it next week. I said no pressure then and I’d wait to hear from her. It's been a week of silence and I'm wondering if she's really into it.

I'm confused. Our relationship was always flirty but we never make a move. She seems interested, then suddenly distant. I don’t know how to read it and whether to remind her or wait.",1,1769517633.0,bodylanguage,6,0.6,False

The Trump administration will invest $1.6 billion in Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth, giving the government an equity stake that could exceed 15% as the White House continues its spree of investments in publicly traded companies.

Since Trump began his second term, the federal government has acquired ownership—or the right to purchase shares—in at least 10 companies. These include a “golden share” in Nippon Steel–owned U.S. Steel and becoming the largest shareholder in USA Rare Earth’s rival, MP Materials. The wave of dealmaking increasingly makes Trump [the CEO-in-chief](https://fortune.com/article/president-donald-trump-ceo-in-chief-dealmaking-business-government-tariffs-nvidia-intel-columbia-university-apple/?utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=NL_fortune-features_2026-1-22_86166&sfmc_id=14851902).

Six of the 10 pertain to the critical minerals industry, including rare earths, [as the U.S. increasingly tries to](https://fortune.com/2025/11/17/us-aims-breathe-easy-china-chokehold-rare-earths/) break China’s near monopoly on a sector that’s vital to manufacturing everything from military equipment to cars to high-powered computing and data centers. Since Trump initiated tariff wars worldwide, China [has leveraged its critical minerals](https://fortune.com/2025/12/09/critical-minerals-us-china-supply-chain/) and high-powered, magnet-manufacturing dominance.

“USA Rare Earth’s heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence,” said U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a statement. “This investment ensures our supply chains are resilient and no longer reliant on foreign nations.”

USA Rare Earth’s (USAR) stock jumped about 6% on Jan. 26 by afternoon trading after the deal was announced, increasing its market cap to about $3.7 billion. The stock is up 125% since the beginning of the year.

The government’s ownership stake could range from 8% to 16% depending on whether all the warrants are executed, according to an SEC filing Jan. 26. The deal includes $277 million in direct federal funding and a $1.3 billion loan through the CHIPS Act. USAR also announced a PIPE (private investment in public equity) deal for $1.5 billion led by large mutual fund players. In PIPE deals, public companies raise fast capital by selling securities directly to private, institutional investors at a negotiated price, typically at a discount.

**Industry analyst Neal Dingmann of William Blair said in a note there’s a likely “assumption that there is more government rare earth funding to come” for other companies.**

The USAR deal gave the U.S. government a nearly 31% discount on its shares compared with its Jan. 23 closing price. The agreement triggered a subsequent jump in the share price.

While the USAR deal comes through the Commerce Department, the previous one with MP Materials was via the Defense Department, showing a lack of consistency in how the deals are negotiated as the administration takes a bespoke approach.

Likewise, the government built a guaranteed price floor into the MP Materials deal, while the USAR agreement includes no such pricing mechanism—yet. The argument is the rare earths to be mined by USAR are less common and less subject to price dumping by China.

# Future of USA Rare Earth

USAR doesn’t produce much yet either, but it’s on the cusp of doing so. Its Round Top rare earths mining and processing project in West Texas is slated to open by the end of 2028—two years earlier than prior projections—and its high-powered magnet manufacturing plant in Stillwater, Okla., is slated to open by the end of this spring.

Last year, USAR bought U.K.-based Less Common Metals, giving the company a processing and metal-making hub in the U.K. with a new facility beginning construction soon in France.

The goal for USAR is to become the only domestic mine-to-magnet manufacturer specializing in the rarer heavy rare earths, especially the dysprosium and terbium metals that are key to high-powered magnets. While rare earths are not, in fact, rare, it is harder to find them in high enough concentrations to economically mine and process them. The heavier rare earths are even more difficult to extract in large enough amounts.

MP Materials is currently the nation’s only mine-to-magnet manufacturer, but MP specializes in mining the lighter rare earths at its Mountain Pass hub in California.

As for the U.S. government’s other investments in critical minerals, the Trump administration has invested in two Canadian players, Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals—both of which are developing U.S. projects—and in North Carolina–based magnets manufacturer Vulcan Elements. The government also has a deal with critical minerals processor, Indiana-based ReElement Technologies, for the rights to buy stock.

# Dingmann suggested keeping an eye on other players the administration could invest in, such as mining developers NioCorp Development, United States Antimony, and even Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths. Lynas is the world’s largest rare earths player outside China and is currently considering developing projects in Texas.

# Jan. 25th, 2026~ The Canon Bryan Interview: Frontier Technologies And The Upcoming Energy Supercycle

[The Canon Bryan Interview: Frontier Technologies And The Upcoming Energy Supercycle | The New Money](https://www.thenew.money/article/the-canon-bryan-interview-frontier-technologies-and-the-upcoming-energy-supercycle)

https://preview.redd.it/sc2b6g7zvvfg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab34121339c128202754752d5282ca85f190bd0a

Canon Bryan is a serial entrepreneur and strategic investor operating at the intersection of energy, nuclear technology, and critical minerals. He is a co-founder of Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE: UEC), NioCorp Developments (NASDAQ: NB), and Terrestrial Energy (NASDAQ: IMSR), and has been early to some of the most consequential themes shaping global energy.

Canon Bryan has consistently identified inflection points where geopolitics, technology, and capital markets converge, helping build companies that address structural supply constraints in nuclear fuel, advanced materials, and low-cost energy. His work has included frontier technologies such as uranium extraction from seawater and synthetic fuels produced from ocean water using high-temperature energy systems.

In this exclusive interview with The New Money, Canon Bryan shares his long-term thesis on the coming energy super-cycle, why nuclear power will underpin AI and supercomputers, and the overlooked importance of critical minerals.

**You have been the co-founder and founder of multiple companies focused on energy and critical minerals. Where did the conviction initially come from to focus on those opportunities?**

That’s an interesting question. In terms of energy, at some point, it became very apparent to me that there would be 3 industries that would experience massive growth this century: food, water and energy. So anything related to, or leveraging those industries would represent a potentially massive opportunity.

Another revelation was that low-cost energy and reliable energy and scalable energy would be on the frontier of the opportunity. Once you look at the galaxy of opportunities through that lens, the numbers of alternatives actually becomes extremely limited. High-temperature nuclear, synthetic fuel, superhot-rock geothermal, and really not a lot else. Bill Gates said that if he had one wish, it would be to provide abundant, low-cost energy. I share that wish. Low-cost abundant energy will massively improve the standard of living for billions of people. So, the dual purpose of achieving an intrinsic good, and providing significant returns to investors, is of great interest.

In terms of critical metals, it is a different dynamic. Many critical metals have the unique and unfortunate character of being abundant but geopolitically constrained. It is perfectly clear that the global supply chain is broken. It has been broken for at least 4 decades. However it is not beyond repair. Cracking the code on most critical metals is actually about thinking and doing business like the Chinese. If one can do that, the opportunity exists to remove supply constraints, and that also translates into an immense financial opportunity for investors. So, that dual purpose is interesting to me.

**You were one of the co-founders of Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE: UEC) which first started more than two decades ago. What was your perspective on the need for domestic uranium production at the time that led you to start the company?**

I was one of the 4 co-founders of UEC, but getting into uranium was not my idea. It didn’t take long to see the huge blinking lights in the market data. Domestic production was basically non-existent. Over 99% of all nuclear fuel was imported. Half of all nuclear fuel was coming from Russia as part of the Megatons to Megawatts deal, where both Russia and the US agreed to downblend the weapons grade fuel in about 20,000 (out of \~27,000) nuclear warheads each. (Russia held their end of the bargain. America did not. But I digress.)

There was no urgency. There was in fact complacency. Added to this was the full-blown Asian industrialization that was causing most all other commodities to skyrocket in the early 2000s. An excellent colleague of mine once said about Washington, DC, that there are only two modes of operation in Washington: complacency and panic. That aphorism applies to most markets. We were witnessing the complacency. We saw the opportunity for panic. And panic we got. Uranium spot price went from $16/lbs to $136/lbs in less than 30 months after we started UEC. Ironically, domestic production never increased all that much, and is still today around 1% of annual domestic reactor requirements.

**Uranium has become a huge focus in federal policy lately in the United States of America. What do you think is causing that shift?**

The geopolitically constrained nature of uranium is patently clear for all to see. It is much worse today than it was in 2004 when the spot price skyrocketed by 900% in 30 months. The reason is because in 2004-2007, Russia was more-or-less our friend. And secondly, the Megatons to Megawatts agreement was still in effect until 2013, with most government officials and pundits complacently and naively believing that the agreement would be renewed for another 20 years. It wasn’t. Today, over 60% of global uranium is produced by Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia. Another 10% by Namibia and Niger. Less than ideal. That leaves Canada, Australia, and a spattering of others. America’s global contribution? Around 0.25 of 1%.

The second layer here is demand. The world is embracing nuclear power today in a way it has not done for over 50 years. Over 30 nations have pledged to treble nuclear capacity by 2050. America itself has pledged to quadruple nuclear capacity by 2050. One of the big drivers is AI-supercompute. The immense energy required for this AI revolution is now becoming not only apparent, but it is broadly cited by the AI industry experts as the biggest rate limiter. No energy = no supercompute. Nuclear holds the keys to this data center tiling unlock.

Another nuance is SMRs. Small Modular Reactors. These represent the next generation of technology for nuclear power. The trick is though that many of the designs require special fuel with much higher levels of U235 isotopic enrichment. That means much more yellowcake is required to fuel these SMRs on a per-unit-of-energy basis. That will also be a huge driver of demand.

**Based on where you see nuclear energy going, how much more investment and government funding commitment do you see needing to go into uranium exploration companies and producers to really be able to meaningfully scale up uranium production within North America?**

I don’t think government funding is the answer for uranium mine development. Equity investment is more traditional. The economics of these mines must stand alone -- without subsidy. More common sense and streamlined regulation would be useful as a government input.

The US needs to increase production from around 400,000 lbs/year to about 45,000,000 lbs/year immediately to become completely self-sufficient. And then likely increase that to 180 million lbs/year by 2050 -- or more, if America is contemplating becoming a net exporter of nuclear fuel, which I think would be a very good thing. How much investment do you need to bring that much reserves into production? Exploration, reserve definition, feasibility and finally construction, are not trivial costs. Let’s assume $30/lbs in pre-op costs for a reserve base of, say, 1 billion lbs. That’s $30 billion. It’s a lot of capital, but not really much relative to how much is invested into supercompute nowadays. Later on, that developed reserve base will likely have to grow to 2 or 3 billion lbs or more.

**What is something you think most investors don’t yet fully understand about the amount of demand for uranium in the future?**

Investors likely don’t get that most of AI-supercompute, robotics, EVs, etc, will be powered by nuclear. The piece of the pie is growing for nuclear. But the entire pie is also growing much faster than people can imagine. This is a reversal of the past 30 years of electricity markets in the US.

Mindsets have calcified around low- to no- growth of electricity demand. Those days are absolutely gone, and for the foreseeable future. Deterministic thinking will find investors on the wrong side of the nuclear trade.

**You were also one of the co-founders of NioCorp Developments (NASDAQ: NB) which is a critical minerals company focused largely on niobium, scandium and titanium. What was the big idea that led you to form that company?**

https://reddit.com/link/1qocq9e/video/3hnnyjghwvfg1/player

I love Niobium. It has near-magical properties in steel fabrication and other technology compounds. **But global niobium production is highly, highly concentrated in a couple of mines in Brazil, which are now majority owned by the Chinese. Not good. A vast reserve lives right in the dead center of our own country – in Nebraska. We would be fools not to exploit it.**

**Obviously niobium and scandium have really become an area of focus alongside of other rare earth elements. Can you share a bit of your own perspective on why these minerals are so essential to the future?**

My previous answer provides a clue. But more broadly, critical metals are so essential in so many thousands of industrial applications: compounds, components, etc.  And like uranium, almost all these metals are totally controlled by foreign nations, usually China. Without these metals, there can be no innovative technologies for the future. Not having sustainable access to these metals is just as bad as them not existing at all.

**NioCorp Developments’ flagship deposit is the Elk Creek Project in Nebraska. Can you share why you chose to focus on that property in particular?**

Back in 2007, I had developed a significant database of critical metals projects that I could pursue. They were universally unwanted at the time, so I had my pick. Elk Creek really stood out for a bunch of reasons. The sheer immensity of the deposit: 5 miles in diameter with basically no limit at depth. It is an ancient, underground, richly-mineralized volcano that is 5 miles wide and goes all the way to the core of the earth. And it has lots of other goodies in it besides just Niobium. My geological consultant at the time, Anthony Mariano, PhD, a global expert on carbonatite structures, had worked extensively on the Elk Creek project in the 70s and 80s, and he had boxes upon boxes of materials on it: reports, studies, maps, drill results, models, and more. The location is excellent, with a willing community, and excellent infrastructure. It’s all there. This deposit, once in production, puts America right back in the international niobium game.

**What is something you think most investors probably don’t fully grasp yet about the strategic importance of a domestic supply chain for niobium and scandium.**

If there were one thing, it is probably niobium’s superior characteristics as a steel additive when it replaces molybdenum. It is far less dense, meaning lighter, but it has far more tensile strength. That means you can make stronger steel with lower mass. That will have massive ripple effects throughout the global industrial economy.

**You were very early on small modular reactor technology as well. Can you share what got you involved with Terrestrial Energy (NASDAQ: IMSR) at the start from an opportunity perspective?**

Back in 2007, I formed a company to interrogate the investment opportunities in critical metals, nuclear fuels, and nuclear technologies. I pursued all three simultaneously. I went on a deep, deep dive down the rabbit hole on the next-generation reactor technologies. I settled early on molten salt reactor technology, but it took me fully five years before I connected with my future co-founders of Terrestrial Energy.

In 2012, we agreed to form a company around Dr. David LeBlanc’s brilliantly elegant MSR design. We incorporated in January 2013. Based on what I saw, and what the 3 partners agreed, David’s design had the best chance of being a low-cost and modular design, capable of fleet deployment in the 2020s. It took us longer than we thought, but the economics and modularity are being borne out by the engineering work.

**Terrestrial Energy is on the leading edge of new molten salt technology for small modular reactors. Why is that important?**

Whichever advanced reactor design deploys first will have a competitive advantage, just by dint of being first. The reason is that there is still very low user sophistication in the end-user market, and in the investment community. However, low-cost is the biggest characteristic of SMR designs that will matter long-term. And Terrestrial Energy is designed to be a low-cost system, whereas most other SMR designs are not.

**Where do you see the future of small modular reactors going from a deployment perspective in the future?**

The demonstration reactors and FOAK reactors are being designed and developed now. The next step is the fleet-scale deployment, where hundreds or thousands of reactors are built and deployed. After that, one can imagine a world where Super-Intelligence coupled with robotics are deploying completely autonomously. ASI will deploy nuclear quickly, accurately, with robust safety, at low cost, on a self-regulated basis. Ten years of community and regulatory handwringing to make a go/no-go decision will be distilled down a 3-microsecond computation.

**You also started a private company SuperCritical Minerals which is focused on uranium extraction from seawater. How does this technology work and why did you want to pursue that?**

The technology is a fairly low-tech but very effective approach for accessing the trillions of pounds of uranium sitting in the world’s oceans. It uses chemically-treated acrylic fibers to adsorb uranium minerals in the ocean. The uranium minerals accumulate in the fibers over about 21 days. Then the fibers are eluted (another chemical treatment) to remove the uranium and other metals. The fibers are then retreated and redeployed, and the cycle continues. This technology is proven in a lab, but has never had proper systematic engineering done to see if it could be scaled to industrial scale. So SuperCritical is doing that. The results so far are surprising. The bottom line is that if we can prove that we can scale this, then there is an infinite, low-cost supply of nuclear fuel until the end of time. I thought that would be worth pursuing.

**Do you anticipate a significant amount of investment capital to start pursuing new types of resource extraction similar to what SuperCritical Minerals is doing as one of the next big technology breakthroughs for energy and commodities?**

Actually, yes. There’s lots of interesting stuff in the oceans, and other aqueous media. For example, the ocean has an infinite supply of hydrogen. And carbon. If you dissociate those and then chemically bind them in the right way, you get jet fuel. Pretty much every element in the periodic table lives in the oceans in vast quantities. It is just sitting there waiting to be extracted for our industrial use. All that’s needed is investment and engineering work in novel technologies.

**You also are involved in a synthetic sustainable aviation fuel company that just went public Syntholene Energy (TSXV: ESAF). Can you share a bit about what they do and why you got involved?**

Syntholene is in the business of synthesizing jet fuel from ocean water. This is not new technology, but it has never been low-cost before. Syntholene has cracked the code on low-cost, high-performance jet fuel, made out of water, and powered by high-temperature geothermal. I got the idea from the work Terrestrial Energy did with Idaho National Labs on using high-temperature nuclear to make low-cost hydrogen via high-temperature electrolysis. High-temperature and shallow geothermal provides the same character of energy as high-temperature nuclear. Namely, thermal energy.

**How big of an opportunity do you see in sustainable fuels as a whole?**

Basically infinite. The condition is that they must be low-cost. The global aviation industry consumes about 400 billion liters a year today. That is projected to increase to 900 billion liters/year by 2050. The entirety of global liquid fuels is up to 4.5 trillion liters/year. And that is projected to grow significantly as well. This can all easily be serviced by the existing high-temperature shallow geothermal. All the world’s greatest products are synthetic. It is only a matter of time before this essential commodity is replaced by low-cost synthetics.

**From your perspective, what is one of the most overlooked themes that is starting to really emerge in the public markets?**

Multiple but interrelated answers here:

1. The immense need for energy.
2. The dangerous dependence on geopolitically constrained commodities.

**Who is one of the smartest people you know who you’d like to see us interview next?**

I can maybe suggest Lord Matt Ridley of the UK. He is a member of the House of Lords, an accomplished scientist, and successful author. He spends some cycles studying and writing and polemicizing about the global energy system. A very illuminating man.

# IMHO~Washington Is Now Buying the Supply Chain (And NioCorp Is Standing in the Lane waiting for it's turn?)

Today, January 27, 2026, marks a quiet but historic inflection point in U.S. industrial policy. The Trump administration’s decision to take a **10% equity stake in USA Rare Earth via a $1.6B debt-and-equity package** is not just another headline — it is confirmation that the federal government has crossed a strategic threshold. This is no longer about grants, rhetoric, or “support.” This is about **ownership**. Washington is now directly buying into critical mineral suppliers as strategic infrastructure. And that single move dramatically reframes how serious investors should be viewing NioCorp.

Because when you zoom out, the pattern becomes undeniable. Elk Creek already has Pentagon funding. EXIM financing discussions are real. The resource just got stronger. The DFS update is pending. And the product mix — **niobium, scandium, titanium, magnet rare earths** — aligns almost perfectly with the exact materials the federal government is now openly securing through equity participation. The market is still pricing NioCorp like a speculative junior. Policy reality says it belongs in the category of **strategic national asset in formation**. That gap doesn’t stay open forever.

The real tectonic shift, though, is scandium. For decades, aerospace and defense have been stuck in the same loop:

[For 30 years, every aerospace, EV, and defense prime has said the same thing about scandium: “We can’t design Sc-Al alloys into next-gen systems until there’s a reliable U.S. supply.” & “ We can’t build a U.S. supply until someone commits to using the alloys.” That deadlock is exactly what stalled the entire U.S. scandium industry… until now. \~Niocorp just broke the loop. NioCorp solved SCANDIUM'S \\""The Chicken or the Egg problem!\\"" & are working to produce alloys to make \\""STUFF!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1qocq9e/video/osfjgaiw0wfg1/player)

* “We can’t design with Sc-Al alloys without reliable supply.”
* “We can’t build supply without committed demand.” That stalemate froze an entire class of next-generation materials.
* **NioCorp just broke the loop.** With the formation of NAMA, the acquisition of FEA’s IP, direct work on scandium-aluminum master alloys, and engagement with defense-adjacent partners, this is no longer a mining story. This is a move into **engineered materials, margin expansion, customer lock-in, and strategic indispensability.**

And now the signal amplification is growing louder. Commerce Secretary **Lutnick’s posture makes it clear**: federal capital will flow toward projects that secure domestic supply chains. At the same time, **Dingman — the same analyst who explicitly flagged the world to watch for NioCorp’s February 2026 Sc-Al alloy reveal with Lockheed — is now talking about NioCorp again.** That’s not coincidence. That’s narrative convergence. Capital, policy, defense, and advanced manufacturing are all beginning to orbit the same name.

The takeaway is simple but profound: **precedent has now been set.** If the U.S. government will take equity stakes in companies that secure critical materials and downstream capability, then Elk Creek is no longer just a financing candidate — it is a **strategic candidate**. That increases the probability of federal participation, de-risks long-term capital, strengthens partner negotiations, and sets the stage for eventual repricing. Not because of hype. But because eventually, the market is forced to recognize infrastructure when it sees it.

And infrastructure, once recognized, does not trade like a junior miner.

**This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions —** they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

[\\""ALL ABOARD!\\"" \~ As NioCorp isn’t building just a mine — it’s building the strategic materials backbone of U.S. defense and advanced manufacturing, with scandium, niobium, titanium, rare earths, and vertical ScAl alloy integration positioning it as the closest thing America has to a Saudi Arabia of critical minerals.](https://reddit.com/link/1qocq9e/video/di6g6qeezvfg1/player)

**IMHO\~This was not a one-off headline —** it was a **policy cannon shot**! Washington is no longer pretending to be a neutral referee in critical minerals; it is actively choosing who matters, who scales, and who survives. When the federal government starts writing checks for equity, it signals that the real winners will be those already embedded in defense supply chains, already advancing downstream capability, already aligned with national priorities. That is exactly where NioCorp sits today. The window of opportunity never closes with a bell — it closes when the repricing happens quietly, institutionally, and permanently. And by the time the broader market finally catches up to the strategic reality now unfolding, the asymmetric opportunity will already belong to those who saw the signal early.

Waiting with many for the DFS & more material news as it becomes available.

Would love some company to chat throughout the day and week (and hopefully longer) as we get to know one another better and help be the reason the other is excited to pick up their phone when they see a message come through :)

Like I said earlier, I’m 31 years old and have two Australian shepherds that keep me busy and always laughing here with their personalities! Love going hiking and exploring new trails and places with them. Enjoy traveling to new places for hiking, checking out new breweries, and always trying to see/feel how the locals live in each new region I visit.

Would love to hear suggestions for next places to go, where you want to travel next, and if you’ve got any 2026 goals and how those are going so far this year!

1qocnl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/taxPH/comments/1qocnl6/bir_audit_question_consolidated_businesses/,BIR audit question: Consolidated businesses & changing business name after 3 years,"May question lang po ako regarding BIR audits.

May 3 businesses ako under my name:

1. Motorcycle repair shop (unang business)

2. DIY yogurt stall sa mall (2nd biz)

3. Coffee shop (mag 3 years operating na)

Balak ko sanang magpalit ng pangalan ng coffee shop, partly para irefresh yung brand, pero honestly para rin iwas kalkal ng lumang booklets kung sakaling magaudit ang BIR.

Sabi ng accountant ko, since consolidated daw yung accounts, kung sakaling may LOA (Letter of Authority), yung unang/main business lang daw ang pupuntahan ng BIR, kahit na mas malakas ang sales ng coffee shop.

Questions:
Totoo ba na kung consolidated, yung main/first business lang ang usually ina audit ng BIR?

Hindi ba talaga nila directly titignan yung coffee shop kahit mas malaki ang kita?

May effect ba sa audit risk kung magpalit lang ng business name pero same owner at same registration?

Mas safe ba magpalit ng name after 3 years, or wala rin masyadong epekto?

Gusto ko lang magka-idea from business owners or accountants na may actual experience.

Salamat po sa sasagot ",1,1769517353.0,taxPH,2,1.0,False

The output always had that weird ""plastic"" look, or I'd spend 2 hours tweaking a prompt just to get the lighting right on a simple coffee mug shot.

Recently started testing a different workflow that basically automates the environment generation from a raw phone pic. Instead of me trying to describe ""morning sunlight on a rustic wooden table"" and failing, it has pre built templates for A10.

the shadows can still be a bit hit-or-miss--but for filling out A+ content or throwing together social posts without shipping samples, it's actually passable.

Not claiming this is groundbreaking tech or anything, but figured I'd mention it since I see so many people burning cash on credits for wrappers that don't really work.

1qocjfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1qocjfq/the_psychology_of_hidden_attraction_9_signs/,The Psychology of Hidden Attraction: 9 Signs Someone's Secretly Into You,"You ever get that weird vibe from someone where they're acting normal but something feels... off? Like they're holding back? Yeah, I've been there. And after digging through psychology research, relationship podcasts, and way too many expert interviews, I realized most of us are terrible at reading these signs. We miss them because we're either oblivious or scared to believe someone might actually like us. So here's what I found, no fluff, just real behavioral science mixed with actual human experience.

## 1: They remember the random shit you said three weeks ago

This is huge. When someone's into you but hiding it, their brain goes into hyperfocus mode. You mention offhand that you hate cilantro or that you're obsessed with some obscure band, and boom, three weeks later they bring it up like it's nothing. That's not coincidence. That's their brain cataloging every detail about you because you matter to them.

Psychology calls this ""motivated attention."" When we care about someone romantically, our brains prioritize information about them. We remember details that seem trivial to everyone else because we're subconsciously building a file on this person. If someone remembers your random coffee order or that story about your childhood dog, they're probably feeling something.

## 2: Their body betrays them even when their mouth doesn't

Watch their feet. Seriously. When someone's hiding feelings, their body language screams what their words won't say. Their feet point toward you in group settings. They lean in when you talk. Their pupils dilate when they look at you (if you're close enough to notice). They mirror your movements without realizing it.

Dr. Amy Cuddy's research on body language shows we can't fully control nonverbal cues when we're emotionally invested. Someone might play it cool verbally, but their body? That's doing its own thing. If they're always angling themselves toward you, touching their face or hair when you're around, or finding excuses to be physically closer, their feelings are leaking out.

## 3: They get weirdly competitive or show offy around you

This one's primal as hell. When someone likes you but won't admit it, they'll suddenly become the most accomplished, funny, talented person in the room when you show up. They're peacocking, even if they don't realize it. Making jokes, telling their best stories, casually mentioning achievements. It's biological display behavior.

Read ""The Evolution of Desire"" by David Buss if you want the deep dive on this. He's an evolutionary psychologist who spent decades studying human mating behavior. The book breaks down how humans unconsciously advertise their value to potential partners. When someone's doing this around you specifically, they're trying to impress you without directly saying ""hey, I like you.""

## 4: They act different around you versus everyone else

Pay attention to how they interact with others compared to you. Are they chill with everyone else but nervous around you? Or maybe super confident with others but weirdly vulnerable with you? That shift in behavior is a dead giveaway.

This inconsistency happens because hidden feelings create internal conflict. They want to be themselves but also impress you. They want to get close but fear rejection. So their behavior gets inconsistent and unpredictable. One day they're texting you constantly, the next they're distant. It's not game playing, it's emotional overwhelm.

## 5: They find ridiculous excuses to contact you

""Hey, random question..."" texts at 10pm. Asking for your opinion on something they definitely don't need your opinion on. Sending you memes that are only mildly funny. These aren't accidents. They're manufactured reasons to stay connected without admitting they just want to talk to you.

Esther Perel talks about this in her podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" She discusses how people create ""plausible deniability"" in early attraction. They need excuses to reach out because direct communication feels too vulnerable. If someone's finding creative reasons to text you about absolutely nothing important, they're probably hiding feelings.

## 6: They get jealous but try to hide it

This one's messy. When someone's into you but hiding it, seeing you with other potential romantic interests triggers them hard. They might make weird comments, suddenly seem less interested in conversation, or ask probing questions about your relationship status disguised as casual curiosity.

Matthew Hussey's ""Get the Guy"" digs into this behavior pattern. He explains that jealousy without a relationship is one of the clearest signs of hidden romantic interest. They have no claim on you, so they can't express jealousy openly. Instead, it comes out sideways, through mood changes or passive comments.

## 7: They're always ""just happening"" to be where you are

Coincidentally at the same coffee shop. Showing up to events they never attended before. Suddenly interested in hobbies you mentioned. This isn't fate, it's intentional proximity seeking. They're engineering chances to see you without making it obvious.

Research on ""mere exposure effect"" shows we develop preferences for things (and people) we encounter frequently. On some level, they know this. By increasing proximity, they're hoping familiarity breeds attraction. If someone's life suddenly overlaps with yours way more than before, they're probably orchestrating it.

## 8: They ask your friends about you

This is middle school behavior that never actually stops. When someone's hiding feelings, they'll pump your mutual friends for information. What's your type? Are you seeing anyone? What do you like to do? They're gathering intel without exposing themselves to potential rejection.

If your friends start mentioning that so-and-so was asking about you, that's not random curiosity. They're trying to assess their chances and learn more about you through a safer channel. It's reconnaissance disguised as casual conversation.

## 9: The eye contact is INTENSE

Eye contact with hidden feelings hits different. It's longer than normal, more frequent than necessary, and often followed by them quickly looking away when you catch them. Or the opposite, they avoid eye contact entirely because it feels too revealing.

Research published in the Journal of Research in Personality found that prolonged eye contact increases feelings of attraction and connection. When someone's fighting their feelings, eye contact becomes this charged thing they can't quite control. Too much reveals them, too little seems weird, so they end up doing this awkward dance of looking and not looking.

## Why people hide feelings in the first place

Here's the thing that most advice skips: people hide feelings for legitimate reasons. Fear of rejection, not wanting to ruin a friendship, workplace complications, timing issues, past trauma, or just general emotional unavailability. It's not always strategic game playing.

Dr. Brené Brown's work on vulnerability explains how admitting romantic feelings is one of the scariest forms of emotional exposure. We're basically saying ""I like you, please don't hurt me with that information."" For some people, hiding feelings feels safer than risking that vulnerability.

Understanding this doesn't mean you should wait around forever for someone to get brave. It just means recognizing that hidden feelings are often about their own fear and limitations, not about your worth.

## What to actually do with this information

Look, spotting these signs is one thing. Acting on them is another. If you're seeing multiple signs and you're interested too, consider making a move yourself. Drop hints back. Create opportunities for them to open up. Or hell, just be direct if you can handle potential awkwardness.

If you want to go deeper into understanding attraction patterns and communication dynamics without spending hours reading every psychology book, there's an app called BeFreed that pulls together insights from relationship experts like Esther Perel, books on evolutionary psychology, and research on social behavior into personalized audio lessons. You can set specific goals like ""understanding hidden attraction signals"" or ""becoming more confident in dating,"" and it creates a structured learning plan tailored to your situation. The content draws from vetted sources, books, expert interviews, and research papers in psychology and relationships, so it's grounded in actual science. You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute detailed breakdowns with real examples. Plus you can pick different voices, including some surprisingly engaging ones that make the commute way less boring.

But if you notice these signs and you're NOT interested, do everyone a favor and establish clearer boundaries. Don't lead them on unintentionally by being overly available or flirty. Clarity is kindness, even when it's uncomfortable.

And if you're the one hiding feelings? Maybe consider that vulnerability isn't actually weakness. The worst that happens is rejection, which sucks but is survivable. The best that happens is you get the connection you actually want instead of this weird half-hidden thing that's exhausting for everyone involved.",2,1769517023.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

Went to *Leaf N Latte Café* for lunch with the girls, and it was honestly both frustrating and disappointing. We expected some waiting time but we didn’t expect to waste nearly an hour and fifteen minutes for food that felt rushed, poorly made, and completely unfulfilling. 

The service itself was lacking and unprofessional, which only made the experience worse. We had to remind them to take our order twice. Ordered a few drinks, wraps, and loaded fries. Drinks were refreshing.

Loaded fries were **average** at best, the cheese wasn’t fully melted, though the chicken was cooked properly. Even then, just a few bites felt extremely heavy and **overwhelming** because of the clash of every sauces known to mankind mixed inside.

The wraps were the *biggest letdown.* It wasn’t even wrapped properly; most of the fillings and cheese were spilling out, and there was some unidentifiable fried substance which we still haven't figured it out. Only justification we could find is that they were shortstaffed and they had to bring in an employee's toddler to help around the kitchen.

We felt guilty wasting food but eventually realised it was better than forcing ourselves to eat something that might make us sick later.  Walking out, we genuinely couldn’t believe we had spent so much time and money on such ""aarkko enthino vendi"" food, especially from a café that’s so hyped up by everyone.

Hoping to hear from others who’ve navigated something similar.

I’m a Staff-level (L6) Product role in big tech and went hard early — three internships in college, started working right after graduation, and got promoted at the fastest pace my company allows. I cared deeply about my work and its impact, and that drive paid off — on paper.

Financially, I’m doing well. Income is \~$500K and net worth just crossed $2M. This is part of the tension – I don’t really need to optimize for max income, and that’s changed how I feel about work.

Lately, I’ve felt burned out and detached. I don’t really care anymore, which scares me because caring fueled my career. At the same time, I feel a strong expectation that I should keep working to not “waste” my peak earning years. Working hard is what I’ve always done — it feels like all I know.



**> The big tension**

One part of me wants calm, simplicity, and peace — slower days and space to exist. Another craves stimulus, novelty, and energy — more life, more options, more things happening. Neither feels like a complete answer; too much stimulus is exhausting but too much calm makes me worry about boredom or career stagnation.

I could push more. I execute and strategize well, have a strong track record, and play well with the C-suite. Director/VP in my early 30s is actually quite possible. But that requires totally new kinds of effort, and I’m honestly not sure how I feel about that. Plus, I don’t really need the paycheck of a leader, and I really hate corporate politics.

For the past 10 years, I focused almost exclusively on work often at the expense of friendships, dating, hobbies, and other interests. Now that my career has stabilized, those gaps feel pressing. I want time and energy to invest in these areas, but work is also where many social connections happen, which makes stepping back complicated. The upside of pushing is very real & significant — but so is the cost.



**> Options I’m considering:** 

* Keep pushing at the same intensity
* Reduce effort and coast
* Take a long unpaid sabbatical (6–12 months, re-evaluate every few months)
* Exit tech completely to explore other interests (real estate, home decor, mentoring, investing, opening my own coffee shop, etc.)



**> My ask if you’re reading this. If you’ve:**

* Burned out after early career success
* Reached financial independence while young / single
* Struggled with motivation once money stopped being the driver
* Navigated the calm vs stimulus tension
* Or dealt with expectations (internal or societal) around continuing to work

I’d really appreciate hearing how you processed it, what helped, and what you wish you’d known earlier. Thanks for reading.",6,1769516772.0,fatFIRE,14,0.61,False
