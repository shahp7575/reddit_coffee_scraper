1lkj3dm,https://i.redd.it/e17toy8vc59f1.jpeg,Chocolate frosting separation,"I’ve been making some variation of this cake for years. It’s a sort of hodge podge recipe based on the chocolate cake my grandmother used to make and the typical Texas sheet cake. 

Anyway, I made it today and poured the hot frosting on the hot cake. Very quickly the butter began to separate. What could’ve caused this?

Recipe:
Grease a 9x13 cake pan. 

Cake ingredients:

2 cups flour
2 cups sugar
2 tsps baking powder
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
2 tsp cinnamon
1 cup (2 sticks) butter 
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 tsps vanilla
3 large eggs
1 cup hot coffee


Preheat oven to 350F. Mix flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in large bowl. 

Melt butter and add cocoa. Stir until smooth. Whisk eggs in a separate bowl. Add eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla to butter and cocoa mixture. Add wet mixture to flour mixture.  Mix well. Add coffee to batter. Pour batter in 9x13 cake pan. Bake for 35 minutes. 

Fudge frosting:

2 sticks salted butter
2 ounces unsweetened cocoa bar
1 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
6 Tbsp milk
5 cups powdered sugar

Melt butter, milk and cocoa in double boiler. Mix in the rest of the ingredients with a hand mixer.

Let's just say that I find him quite cute and have been trying to work up the courage to ask him to hang out one on one, for a coffee or something?

Anyway, I have noticed looking at me a lot or glancing for a few seconds at a time. Most of the time, he'll look away. This has happened so many times but here as a few examples -

When we were sat watching a movie, he sat next to me. At this point we were sharing a blanket and pillow, with our legs resting against each other. The first ten minutes of the movie, I counted he glanced at me me four times. The fifth time I look at him and he shot his head away.

When he was stood behind me, I turned to look at him, the same thing happened again.

Other times, he'll hold his stare and we just look at each other with a look of understanding, or a blank expression. He will sometimes smile back me, if I do so first.

1lkitjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBarcelona/comments/1lkitjz/6_days_without_power_in_our_flat_slow_and/,6 days without power in our flat – slow and neglectful reply from the agency,"Hi everyone,

This is my first post here, but I wanted to share our really frustrating situation in our rented attic flat in the Vilapicina area—and maybe ask for some help on what to do. We’ve now been without electricity for six full days, and we still have no clear solution from the agency we’re renting the place from.

We’re a couple who recently moved to Barcelona, and we share the flat with four other tenants. We’re still learning Spanish and a bit of Catalan, but we have a serious language barrier when it comes to communicating, especially with officials. The other tenants are Spanish-speakers, but either from other parts of the country or from abroad, and most of them work long hours.

The electricity went out on Friday night, and we couldn’t reach anyone from the agency until Monday morning. ""They don't work on weekends"" - they said. Then they sent a technician later on Monday, but he left without fixing anything. We were told he was trying to locate the electricity meter in the basement, but couldn’t identify which one belonged to our flat. Later, we found out there had already been an electrical issue related to this flat back in January, before we moved in.

Since then, the agency keeps assuring us they want to solve the problem as soon as possible, but we haven’t seen any real progress. The only concrete action they’ve proposed is a video call with an “expert”, scheduled for tomorrow, and they asked if any of the tenants are available to attend. The call is during a workday, and it feels like they’re pushing their own work and responsibility onto us instead of managing it properly. They also told us that if no one is available for the video call tomorrow, the issue will be postponed until next week as if it’s our job to make repairs happen.

Meanwhile, the flat has become almost unlivable. Everything in the fridge and freezer has spoiled, and the heat inside is nearly unbearable. It’s the attic floor, after all. We can’t cook, we spend nights by candlelight, and we’ve had to go to coffee shops and shopping malls just to charge our phones and laptops. We haven’t received any clear information about when the issue will be fixed, someone even mentioned that it won’t be a quick process. We also asked about possible compensation, but they seem to be trying to avoid the topic as much as possible. Some flatmates were even allegedly accused in private for using high-consumption appliances and told they might have to cover the damages.

We’re really trying to stay calm and handle this reasonably, but after almost a week, we’re starting to feel powerless and neglected. We’re not sure what else we can do at this point. The whole situation seems surreal.

As I mentioned, we’re new here. Is there any way to accelerate or escalate this case and put some pressure on the agency? Has anyone here gone through something similar in Barcelona?",2,1750888624.0,AskBarcelona,0,1.0,False

So I work in a small office where everyone sort of knows everyone, but I’m not particularly close to anyone outside of emails and casual hallway talk. There's this woman, let’s call her Lisa, who I see often in the break room. She’s always been super kind and smiley. Lately, I noticed she had a bit of a bump, and I assumed (key word) she was pregnant.

Anyway, we were both waiting for the coffee machine to finish, and I, being a moron, smiled and asked, “So when are you due?”

Her face completely dropped. She blinked, laughed awkwardly, and said, “I’m not pregnant.”

I froze. I tried to laugh it off but there was absolutely no salvaging the moment. I mumbled something like, “Oh god I’m so sorry, I really though” but she just smiled politely and left.

I haven’t seen her since. My coworkers definitely noticed something was weird because the vibe around the office feels ten degrees colder when I enter a room.

I didn’t mean to body shame her. I genuinely thought she was pregnant. But I realize now how f***ed up it is to ever make that assumption.

TL;DR: Thought my coworker was pregnant. Asked when she was due. She wasn’t pregnant. Now I’m the villain of our office sitcom.",0,1750888594.0,tifu,5,0.44,False
1lkisoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorTalesCommunity/comments/1lkisoo/the_order_chapter_1/,The Order - chapter 1,"The air in Jerusalem, 1099 AD, hung thick with the suffocating stench of dust, blood, and desperate, bone-deep prayer. For weeks, the ancient city had groaned under the First Crusade's relentless, unholy siege, a crucible that tested not just flesh and steel, but the very marrow of a man's soul. For the thirteen battle-scarred, weary knights of the fledgling Knights Templar, victory, should it ever come, felt hollow, tainted by the endless, dehumanizing struggle. They were men of God, sworn to His cause with a fervor that bordered on fanaticism, yet the horrors they had witnessed – the righteous fury twisted into monstrous acts, the unholy savagery met with equal brutality, the endless, meaningless dying – had etched themselves onto their very souls. Hope, a precious commodity, was a flickering ember, kept alive only by the fierce, unyielding conviction that their suffering, their sacrifice, served a divine purpose beyond mortal comprehension. Each sunrise brought not renewed vigor, but a fresh wave of exhaustion, a heavier weight of lives lost and atrocities endured in God's name.  
  
Led by the stoic and unyielding Kaelan, their captain, a man whose silence often spoke more than a thousand shouted commands, his eyes holding the haunted depths of too many battlefields, and the fiery, quick-witted Gareth, their chronicler and strategist, whose intellectual curiosity burned even amidst the chaos, this small company was a brotherhood forged in a crucible of holy war. They were a band of brothers, yes, but also a tapestry of souls, each thread distinct yet inextricably bound. There was the kindly Arthur, the eldest, whose gentle eyes belied a spirit of iron forged in countless skirmishes, often the quiet comforter; Tristan, the observant warrior-poet, who, even amidst the desolation, found a bleak, profound beauty in the arc of a sword or the steadfastness of a dying comrade; Lancelot, bold and impetuous, always first into the fray, his courage bordering on recklessness, yet possessing a heart fiercely loyal; Percival, whose unwavering spiritual devotion made him their moral compass, his prayers a constant murmur even in the din of battle; Gawain, the steadfast shield, whose loyalty was absolute, a rock against any tide; Galahad, the youngest, pure of heart and fiercely idealistic, still wrestling with the grim realities of their holy mission; Bors, the pragmatic quartermaster, ever concerned with logistics and survival, his feet firmly planted on the earth; Ector, the silent guardian, always positioned to protect his brethren, his presence a comforting bulwark; Kay, sharp-tongued and cynical, a master of biting wit, but with an unshakeable, unspoken bond to his brothers that defied his outward gruffness; Lamorak, swift and agile, their scout and silent hunter, often a phantom on the battlefield; and Bedivere, meticulous and detail-oriented, who remembered every tactical nuance, every supply count, every historical precedent. Each had faced death a hundred times, and each time, by some miracle, had been spared. But the toll of that sparing weighed heavily.  
  
Their task that sweltering afternoon was to scout a section of the ancient city walls, crumbling near what was whispered to be the fabled ruins of the Temple Mount. A recent Saracen catapult strike, aimed to collapse a tower, had instead widened a pre-existing fissure in the old stone. It wasn't a breach, but a significant crack, snaking deep into the masonry, hinting at forgotten depths. As Gareth, ever observant, his historian's eye always searching for forgotten lore, peered into the newly formed crevice, he swore he saw a faint, unnatural luminescence emanating from deep within. It wasn't the glint of torchlight from enemy patrols, nor the mundane, reflected glare of the setting sun. This was something else, something softer, yet impossibly bright, pulsing with an inner light that seemed to draw the very essence of their tired souls.  
  
""By the saints,"" he murmured, his voice hushed, the words barely escaping his parched throat as he beckoned Kaelan closer. ""There is light within. Not a fire, not the sun. It almost... pulses. It feels… different.""  
  
Kaelan peered into the gloom, his seasoned eyes narrowing, his hand instinctively going to his sword hilt, a lifetime of caution ingrained in his bones. The air wafting from the fissure felt strangely cool, a stark contrast to the oppressive heat and dust of the siege. ""A trap, perhaps?"" he speculated, his voice low, his senses on high alert. ""A Saracen trick?""  
  
""Perhaps,"" Gareth conceded, his voice barely a whisper, his eyes fixed on the distant glow. ""But one unlike any Saracen could devise. It feels… ancient. Sacred. It sings to something deep inside me."" His scholarly mind, usually so grounded in logic, was captivated, pulled by an invisible current. ""I must see. We must see.""  
  
Kaelan, sensing the profound conviction in Gareth's voice, a conviction that transcended mere curiosity, gave a curt nod. ""Lead on, Gareth. If it is a trap, we meet it together. Bors, secure the entrance from above. Gawain, stand ready, shield up.""  
  
One by one, they squeezed through the narrow opening, their heavy armor scraping against the rough-hewn stone, each breath catching in their throats. Their torches, once bright beacons against the oppressive darkness of the passage, now seemed to shrink, their flames flickering nervously, dwarfed and diminished in the presence of that preternatural glow ahead. The air grew heavy, thick with the dust of ages and the scent of ozone, yet paradoxically felt incredibly clean, almost sterile, as if they were stepping from a world of disease and death into a place of absolute purity. An eerie silence descended, a profound quiet that swallowed the distant sounds of the siege – the shouts of men, the clang of steel, the rumble of siege engines – muffling them to a faint, forgotten hum, as if they had stepped not just into another space, but into another dimension, where time itself held its breath.  
  
They descended, the passage twisting and turning, the walls becoming smoother, more deliberately carved, bearing symbols they did not recognize, yet which filled Percival with a strange, undeniable spiritual resonance, a sense of rightness. The faint, beckoning glow grew steadily stronger, casting dancing shadows ahead of them, pulling them deeper into the earth. Lancelot, ever eager for discovery, pushed slightly ahead, his hand on his sword, his usual bravado tempered by the palpable sanctity of their surroundings. ""What is this place?"" he whispered, his voice hushed, a rarity for him. ""It feels… like nothing I’ve known.""  
  
Kay scoffed, though his voice lacked its usual biting cynicism, replaced by a tremor of uneasy wonder. ""Probably some forgotten cellar, Lancelot. Or a very elaborate rat's nest for some hermit monk with delusions of grandeur."" Even he, the eternal skeptic, felt the weight of something immense.  
  
""No,"" Arthur murmured, his voice laced with profound awe, his gentle eyes wide. ""This is no cellar. It feels… hallowed. Blessed. As if no darkness has ever touched it.""  
  
The passage abruptly opened into a vast, hidden chamber, breathtaking in its simplicity and grandeur. Circular in design, its domed ceiling was lost in the high gloom, seemingly limitless. It was a space untouched by the ravages of time or war, clean and pristine, as if it had been sealed only yesterday. The very air vibrated with an immense, palpable energy, a silent thrum that resonated deep within their bones, a resonance that was both terrifying and utterly sublime.  
  
And there they were.  
  
In the exact center of the chamber, bathed in an ethereal, golden luminescence that seemed to originate from nowhere and everywhere at once, stood the Ark of the Covenant. Its gold gleamed with an impossible radiance, untarnished by the millennia, the cherubim wings poised as if about to take flight, their faces turned towards each other in eternal reverence. Beside it, radiating a soft, inviting warmth that banished the chill of ages from their bones and filled their hearts with an inexplicable peace, was the Holy Grail, brimming with a light so pure and vibrant it hummed with a life force so profound it resonated deep within their very souls. It was the source of the ethereal glow, a beacon of unspeakable holiness.  
  
The knights, hardened warriors who had faced death countless times without flinching, who had witnessed every horror humanity could inflict, dropped to their knees as one, their swords clattering softly on the ancient floor. Awe, profound and paralyzing, battled with a terror born not of fear, but of absolute reverence, in their hearts. This was not a relic to be worshipped from afar; this was the undeniable, overwhelming presence of the Divine itself. They felt stripped bare, their souls laid open before an infinite light, every sin, every doubt, every imperfection exposed, yet paradoxically, they felt no condemnation, no fear, only an immense, profound peace, a sense of belonging to something vastly greater than themselves.  
  
A light, brighter than a thousand suns, erupted from the Ark, expanding with a silent, blinding roar to fill the entire chamber and encompassing the thirteen men completely. It was pure, raw energy, not painful, but utterly overwhelming, stripping away every facade, every doubt, every earthly concern, until only their absolute, unshakeable faith remained. A voice, not heard with their ears but felt in the very marrow of their bones, a vibration that resonated with their every fiber, flowed through them. It was the voice of God, profound and resonant, speaking not in words they understood with their minds, but with truths that their souls instantly recognized – speaking of their unwavering faith, their immense sacrifices in His name, and the enduring, insidious evil that plagued His creation, an evil far deeper and more ancient than any earthly foe, an enemy that had festered in the shadows since time immemorial.  
  
""My chosen,"" the voice boomed, yet simultaneously caressed their spirits with infinite compassion, ""you have found that which was hidden from the sight of men since the dawn of ages. You have remained steadfast in a world of turmoil and despair, unbowed by darkness. Now, be my hand in the world, for a greater war awaits, one unseen by mortal eyes, against forces of darkness that seek to corrupt all creation, to drag humanity into a permanent abyss.""  
  
As the divine words vibrated through them, the Ark and the Grail began to shimmer, their solid forms dissolving into pure, coalescing light. The raw, divine energy flowed, not around them, but into them, binding with their very essence. It felt like fire and ice, dissolution and recreation, a painful ecstasy as their very molecular structure was rewritten. From the swirling brilliance, magnificent forms began to coalesce. Before their astonished eyes, the Ark resolved into thirteen gleaming cruciform swords, each blade impossibly sharp, shimmering with an inner light, each hilt perfectly balanced, adorned with subtle, ancient symbols that seemed to glow with a quiet, boundless power. The Grail transformed into thirteen kite shields, polished to a mirror sheen, each bearing a subtly etched cross, light radiating from its surface, seeming to pulse with a heartbeat, warm and reassuring, an extension of their very being.  
  
As each knight instinctively reached for their new weapon and shield, a profound, undeniable change rippled through their bodies, a violent shudder that ended in exhilarating stillness. A deep, festering gash on Kaelan's forearm, sustained hours earlier from a Saracen blade, vanished as if it had never been, the skin smoothing to flawless perfection. Gareth's shattered leg, a painful souvenir from a skirmish days ago, knitted itself back together in mere seconds, the bone reforming, muscle rejoining, until he could stand with newfound vigor, testing his weight. A sense of invigorating, boundless strength surged through them, an unshakeable knowledge of their indestructibility, their newfound ability to sense the foul, sickening stain of true evil, a chill that prickled their very core in the presence of malice, growing more intense the deeper the corruption. They felt their hearts beat with the rhythm of eternity, a subtle hum of divine power coursing through their veins.  
  
Then, the voice of God returned, clear and unwavering, cutting through their wonder. ""You are bound to me, eternally. You shall be the Warrior Priests Most High of the Order of Melchizedek, my right hand, my eternal guardians. You shall strike down evil where it lurks, banish the demons of Hell back to the abyss from whence they came. You shall know no true end, no final defeat, for you are my eternal crusade against the shadow.""  
  
One by one, the thirteen knights, humbled, awestruck, and irrevocably changed, spoke their solemn vow, their voices echoing in the now silent chamber, words that would bind them for an eternity. ""We pledge our souls, our strength, our eternal vigilance, to your will, Most High. We are your sword, your shield, your ceaseless hand against the darkness, until the very end of days.""  
  
The light subsided, leaving them invigorated, immortal, and armed with weapons forged from divinity itself. They were still men, bearing the names and memories of their mortal lives, but now they were something infinitely more. They were the chosen, consecrated for an unending war, destined to walk the earth as living legends, their true purpose hidden from the world.  
  
The cavern began to rumble. The distant clamor of the siege, previously muted, now slammed into their ears, amplified by the confined space. Saracen voices, frantic and guttural, echoed from above. They had been discovered.  
  
""To arms!"" Kaelan roared, the command echoing with a power that vibrated off the ancient walls, a new resonance in his voice. He hefted his cruciform sword, its divine light momentarily flaring. ""To the breach! God wills it!""  
  
Lancelot, his impetuousness now coupled with an almost feral certainty, was already moving, his new shield a glowing bastion before him. He sprang towards the narrow passage, followed swiftly by Lamorak, a blur of motion. The two of them surged through the tight fissure, emerging onto the sun-baked, blood-soaked ground of Jerusalem's outer walls, directly into a melee of astonished Saracen guards.  
  
A burly Saracen warrior, his scimitar raised high, lunged at Lancelot. The blade, meant to cleave steel and bone, struck the glowing kite shield with a deafening clang that reverberated through the air, sending a shockwave that shattered the Saracen's arm and buckled his knees. Lancelot didn't hesitate. His new sword, light as a feather yet impossibly solid, sang through the air, a blur of silver-white. It passed through the Saracen's breastplate as if it were parchment, the blow not cutting, but cleansing. The Saracen's eyes widened in horror and a sickening, ethereal light erupted from his mouth, a fleeting, dark vapor that dissipated instantly. The warrior fell, not with the gushing blood of a mortal wound, but with a sudden, silent crumpling, as if his very essence had been expunged.  
  
Lamorak, meanwhile, was a whirlwind. He darted around another Saracen's clumsy spear thrust, his own cruciform blade flashing. It met the spear haft, not chipping or deflecting, but utterly disintegrating the wood into shimmering dust. He spun, his shield catching a mace blow with a similar, stunning force, then drove his sword forward. The enemy dissolved in a puff of acrid smoke, leaving only their discarded weapon.  
  
""By God's grace!"" Gareth cried, his scholar's mind struggling to comprehend the impossible. He raised his own sword, its weight perfectly balanced, and met a Saracen attacking Kay. The enemy's axe simply bounced off Gareth's new shield, leaving not a scratch. Gareth's blade, with a single, elegant thrust, found its mark, and the Saracen screamed, not in pain, but in sheer, otherworldly terror as a shadowy, struggling form was torn from his body, shrieking as it dissolved into nothingness. The human husk crumpled, limp and lifeless. ""They are… possessed!"" Gareth realized, the chilling truth settling deep in his soul. This was not just war; it was an exorcism on a battlefield.  
  
Arthur, his kind face now grim with righteous fury, found himself facing a trio of Saracens. One thrust a spear at his chest. Arthur merely walked forward, his glowing shield deflecting the spear point as if it were a twig. The force of his advance, coupled with the divine energy emanating from the shield, was enough to send the man reeling, his grip numb. Arthur’s sword moved with unhurried precision, purging the darkness from each attacker in turn. They didn't fall to bleeding wounds, but collapsed like puppets with their strings cut, a faint, dark smoke coiling from their bodies before vanishing.  
  
Gawain, ever the bulwark, positioned himself to guard the narrow passage, his massive frame a living shield. Arrows rained down from the battlements above, a storm of iron and wood. They struck his kite shield with clangs that resonated like thunder, but instead of piercing or lodging, they simply crumpled, their kinetic energy utterly absorbed, falling harmlessly to the ground. He didn't even flinch.  
  
Bors, pragmatic even in this impossible moment, saw a group of Saracen archers attempting to reload. He drew his bow, notched an arrow, and aimed. But as he loosed it, a blinding light shot from his cruciform sword, encompassing the projectile. The arrow, now infused with divine energy, became a bolt of pure, piercing light. It struck the lead archer with the force of a battering ram, flinging him backward. The archer's companions recoiled, their faces etched with superstitious dread.  
  
Ector moved with silent, deadly grace. He engaged a Saracen cavalryman, whose horse reared in fear at the sight of the glowing knight. Ector's sword didn't cut the horse's leg; it touched it, and the very ground beneath the animal seemed to solidify, trapping it momentarily, allowing Ector to dismount the rider with a swift, purging blow.  
  
Kay, true to form, grumbled even as he fought. ""Well, this is certainly more efficient than hacking away for hours. Though I miss the satisfying crunch of good old-fashioned bone."" He parried a clumsy sword swing, his shield glowing brightly, and with a flick of his wrist, dispelled the shadowy presence within his opponent. ""Less messy too, I suppose.""  
  
Galahad, the youngest, his eyes wide with a mixture of terror and exhilarating zeal, faced a Saracen wielding a curved jambiya. The blade sliced across Galahad's arm. He felt the phantom pain, a fleeting discomfort, but saw no wound, no mark. His flesh knitted back together even as the blade passed. He stared at his arm, then at the Saracen, a profound, chilling realization dawning on him. He was truly indestructible. With renewed fervor, he surged forward, his pure heart burning with a divine fire, driving the Saracen back with a series of powerful, unyielding blows.  
  
Percival, ever mindful of their spiritual calling, did not merely fight; he purified. His movements were almost a dance, his shield a barrier of light, his sword a channel of divine will. He spoke not curses, but quiet prayers, and with each strike, the demons possessing their foes shrieked and recoiled before being forced back into the abyss.  
  
Bedivere, observing the unfolding chaos with his usual analytical precision, noticed that the strongest Saracens, the ones who seemed to fight with unnatural strength and malicious cunning, were the ones from whom the darkest, most resilient smoke emanated upon defeat. He made a mental note, cataloging the patterns of demonic presence.  
  
The tide of battle turned with impossible swiftness. The Saracens, accustomed to mortal combat, were utterly bewildered by foes who could not be cut, could not be harmed, who purged them with light rather than blood. Panic rippled through their ranks. They were fighting specters, angels of death, or perhaps, as some began to whisper, the very hand of God. The thirteen knights, a glowing phalanx of unwavering light, carved a path through the remaining Saracen detachment, their divine weapons a testament to their sacred pact. The holy war, for them, had just truly begun.  
  
2025 AD, Huntsville, Alabama.  
  
The morning sun streamed through the kitchen window of a deceptively ordinary suburban house, illuminating the worn wooden table. Thirteen men sat around it, not in armor, but in various states of comfortable disarray – faded t-shirts, well-loved flannel, a few with newspapers or mugs of coffee warming their hands. The aroma of sizzling bacon, eggs, and freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint, metallic scent of ancient steel that seemed to cling to them, a scent only they could truly discern, a constant, subtle reminder of their sacred burden.  
  
""Remember that time in the trenches, Verdun?"" Arthur, his face a network of kindly wrinkles that belied the ancient wisdom in his eyes, chuckled, wiping bacon grease from his chin with a napkin. ""Gareth, you were so busy arguing with that Incubus about theological dogma, you almost let him get a clean shot at your head. Said he was misinterpreting Augustine! Honestly, sometimes I think you enjoy the debates more than the actual fighting.""  
  
Gareth, looking no older than fifty despite centuries of living, pushed his spectacles up his nose, a wry grin on his face. ""He was misinterpreting Augustine, Arthur! Someone had to correct him, even if he was a literal spawn of perdition. Besides, Kay was there to pull me out of the mire, weren't you, you old curmudgeon? Always complaining, always saving our hides.""  
  
Kay, eternally looking like he'd just woken up on the wrong side of a very long, unpleasant millennium, grunted from behind his newspaper. ""Someone has to keep you theologians from getting yourselves killed by your own verbose arguments. Good thing I'm still spry enough to yank a few tons of mud-caked knight out of a trench. My back's still complaining about that one, and it's been over a hundred years! You'd think the instantaneous healing would stop the phantom aches, but no, the memory lingers."" He paused, lowering his paper slightly to eye them all. ""Still, beats getting turned into a new breed of ghoul, I suppose.""  
  
Kaelan, still the quiet anchor of the group, sipped his coffee, his gaze distant, lost in the shadows of centuries. A faint, almost imperceptible scar traced his jawline – a memento from a particularly vicious demon in the Crimean War, healed so quickly it barely registered in his memory now, though the icy malice of the encounter itself remained sharp. ""It's a wonder we survived Napoleon, let alone two World Wars, with you two constantly debating everything from demonic possession to proper knife etiquette, while Tristan writes sonnets by moonlight and Lancelot tries to charge a tank with his sword.""  
  
Tristan, lean and thoughtful, adjusted his mug. ""A tank, Kaelan, that was in Korea. And it was a necessary distraction. Its driver was clearly influenced, a nascent demon twisting his will, and the tank's gun would have crippled Bors's transport. A direct assault from a divine blade often draws the eye, creates a momentary vacuum of chaos for others to exploit."" He gazed out the window, at the suburban tranquility. ""The world has changed so much. So fast. Sometimes I wonder if we’re truly keeping pace with the new forms of darkness.""  
  
Lancelot, who had been quietly devouring a plate piled high with eggs, swallowed noisily, then fixed Tristan with a bold stare. ""And it worked, didn't it? Cleared the way for Bors to get the supplies through! Besides,"" he added with a mischievous glint in his eye, ""a proper charge always makes a statement. Even to a tank. You should have seen the look on that demon's face when the driver's eyes flared and I drove the cruciform blade through the viewport. Priceless.""  
  
Bors, ever practical, ever grounded, nodded, munching his toast. ""The supplies were critical, Lancelot. Though I've always maintained a well-placed explosive charge would have been far more efficient than a broadsword and sheer audacity. Still, it got the job done. We adapt, don't we? From siege engines to jet fighters, the methods change, but the enemy’s ancient.""  
  
""Where's the flair in that, Bors?"" Bedivere chimed in, meticulously buttering a piece of toast, his movements precise and unhurried. ""Efficiency is for accountants, not divine warriors. Imagine the stories that would be lost. The sheer spectacle, Lancelot, is a weapon in itself against those who seek to cloak themselves in shadow.""  
  
""And yet,"" Ector rumbled, his deep voice like gravel, his eyes scanning the faces around the table as if still on watch, ""Bedivere's meticulous planning is what often saves our hides when Lancelot's flair gets us into a bind. Remember the Falklands? His contingency plans for that Argentinian sub, mapping the exact currents and depths for us to intercept, saved Galahad's skin. The sheer cold of the deep water almost felt worse than any fire."" He winked at Lancelot, who merely grinned back, unapologetic, already reaching for another slice of bacon.  
  
""Indeed, the meticulous one,"" Kay muttered, folding his newspaper, though a small, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. ""Remember that time in Stalingrad? We were knee-deep in ice and demons, the very ground frozen solid with human misery, and Bedivere was still mapping out optimal caloric intake for the week, calculating the exact energy expenditure for battling frostbite and a Lord of Hell simultaneously. Said our divine regeneration needed proper fuel, even then.""  
  
Bedivere bristled good-naturedly. ""It was crucial for morale! A well-fed knight is a more effective knight, even when fighting unholy abominations in sub-zero temperatures that would shatter lesser men. Plus, the correct nutrient balance aids in rapid cellular regeneration, minimizing downtime after, say, having your arm ripped off by a particularly large ghoul.""  
  
Percival, serene as ever, finally spoke, his voice calm and clear, cutting through the playful banter with a quiet authority. ""All our roles are vital. Each one a thread in God's immense tapestry. Even Kay's perpetual cynicism serves to ground us, to remind us of the harsh, unyielding realities we face, lest we become too detached."" He paused, his gaze thoughtful. ""The weight of a thousand years is heavy. Sometimes, I feel the echoes of every prayer, every sin, every act of evil we have witnessed, all at once. But then I remember the light.""  
  
Kay just scoffed. ""Someone has to be realistic. You all get too lofty sometimes. Someone needs to worry about the grocery bill, too. And the internet bills. And the obscure tax laws. Immortality comes with an awful lot of paperwork now, apparently.""  
  
Galahad, his youthful face earnest, looked around at them, a mixture of reverence, affection, and a touch of melancholy in his eyes. He poured himself another cup of coffee, the steam warming his face. ""It's incredible, isn't it? A thousand years. Cities rising and falling, humanity changing so much, from feudal lords to virtual realities. And we're still here, still fighting, still... us. Still sitting around a kitchen table, just like a thousand years ago, only with better coffee and less risk of dysentery."" He sighed, a subtle, age-old weariness in the sound. ""Sometimes, I remember the faces of the people we couldn't save, the ones consumed by the darkness before we could reach them. Those memories don't heal quite as fast as our wounds, do they?""  
  
""No, lad,"" Arthur said softly, his gaze sweeping over each of them, a profound love and understanding in his ancient eyes. ""They don't. That's the price of eternity. But that's why we fight. To honor those memories. To prevent more of them."" He reached across the table, laying a gnarled, strong hand on Galahad's arm. ""More than us, lad. More than we ever were. We're family. Always have been, always will be. Bound by an oath, by the sacred fire that remade us, and by the blood we’ve spilled together, both ours and theirs, across a thousand years of battle.""  
  
Laughter, touched now with a deeper resonance, filled the kitchen again, easy and genuine, a sound that had echoed through countless dwellings, from stone castles to canvas tents to modern suburban homes across the centuries. A thousand years. A thousand years of battling unseen horrors, of watching empires rise and fall, of witnessing humanity's darkest impulses and its most profound moments of grace. They had fought in every war, walked every continent, whispered counsel to kings and peasants alike. Nations had risen and fallen, technologies had soared beyond imagination, but the nature of evil, and their sacred duty, remained unchanged. And still, they were here. Still together. More than friends, more than comrades-in-arms, they were family, bound by a pact sworn in the presence of God, by the shared eternity of their holy war, and by the countless lives they had saved, and those they had failed to save.  
  
""Well,"" Galahad said, finally, setting down his mug, a renewed resolve firming his jaw. ""Another day, another fight, I suppose. What do you think the dreams will bring tonight? A demon in Davos? A succubus in Silicon Valley?""  
  
""Indeed, lad,"" Ector rumbled, his voice holding the quiet certainty of ancient mountains, passing him the last piece of bacon. ""Somewhere, evil stirs. It always does. And soon, the dreams will tell us where. The Lord works in mysterious ways, but His messages, now, are always clear.""  
  
And they knew, with an ancient certainty that settled deep in their bones, a certainty forged in fire and faith across a thousand years, that they would be there to meet it.",1,1750888561.0,HorrorTalesCommunity,0,1.0,False

Hey there—👋 If you’re tired of swiping and craving something real, let’s talk. I’m a laid-back 5’8” guy with a wicked sense of humor, looking for my fellow nerd, you can be normal too as long as you got a big heart and a bigger butt (joke) 

Picture this: cozy nights after work debating dinner plans or cuddling on the couch watching shitty shows mixed with dumb jokes and hand holding. I love concerts, museum hangs, and low-key adventures, but I’m just as happy spending time together or sharing experiences together.

I’m all about loyalty, honesty, and keeping it real—life’s messy, and I want someone to laugh with through the chaos, hug it out when things get heavy, and grow alongside. You’re probably introverted with a big heart, a little nerdy about something obscure (tell me!), and you balance self-care with not taking life too seriously. (Bonus points if you can be super outspoken—and if you game on PC, if you don't that's fine, be open to getting a PC haha)

About me: Peanut butter-skinned, 160lbs, affectionately tactile, and the guy friends call to fix their Wi-Fi. 

I’ll make you laugh, remember your coffee order, and stick around when things get deep. If you’re a homebody who occasionally craves live music or midnight convos, and you want a drama-free connection (plus a hoodie to “borrow”), DM me. No rush, no pressure—just two weirdos seeing if our chaos aligns. Let’s trade stories and see where it goes.


Thanks for reading, genuinely I'll be around.

1lkir34,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1lkir34/first_clear_120_hours_a_perspective_from_someone/,First Clear - 120 hours: A perspective from someone new to factory games,"Wow, this game absolutely blew me away. I have never played a factory game before, and little experience with other creative/survival/base-building games. I never played minecraft, but I do have a few hours in Valheim and back in the day, Ark Survival Evolved (probably less than 30 combined). I always bounced off of pure creative games because I find them too open-ended. No goals, just one giant sandbox. I just cannot come up with stuff to build.

I jumped in soon after the 1.0 release.

My takeaways and tips for new players, some of which are repeated from stickied posts, but those helped me a lot. My play style is somewhere between the Chef and the Engineer from that comic describing the archetypes.

\- Avoid browsing the wiki, but do research specific questions.

The wiki has tons of helpful information, but reading about resource paths I could be using (and the wiki authors write somewhat prescriptively, so it felt more like \*should\* be using), technologies I should prioritize, etc. just sucks the fun out of this game. I dont know who said it, but the phrase ""Players will do their best to optimize the fun out of the game"" really rings true. For example, I did not research or read about optimized fluid flow or laod balancing, but I did research how to avoid sloshing (A: Raise your supply pipes above your consuming devices)

\- Take your time

Satisfactory is the perfect blend of goal-oriented but open ended solutioning. Ada never tells you how to achieve milestones or space elevator goals. She never hounds you for taking too long. Sometimes it's really fun to just sit back and watch the stacks of resources fill up, or a conveyer manifold saturate after you upgraded the miner. You don't lose anything playing this game, and the stories of people endlessly re-starting worlds after 10-20 hours surprised me.

\- Focus on taking the very next step

I managed to not get the very common feeling of being overwhelmed that many new players experience... until I hit phase 4/5 goals. Unlocking the nuclear tree and imagining the craziness that would be required to implement it really hit me. But the game threw me for a loop, because despite one of the space-elevator items literally being called NUCLEAR pasta, it does not actually require you to interact with the radioactive resource paths. I would actually recommend avoiding nuclear power for most players. You can totally beat the game without it. Maximizing oil and geothermal usage is way more palatable. In addition, the milestones within a tier are really well constructed, and just pursuing enough factory development to automate making the stuff you need for the very next tier made advancing very digestible.

\- The game gives you a ton of tools, you dont have to use them.

I beat the game without using a single railway/train. I used tractors and stations for most of my resource movement, then drones for the really far away resources. I never built a ""second base"". I didnt remove all the fog of war from the map. I collected 18 somersloops, 43 mercer spheres, and 25 hard drives. I think I only used 2 alternate recipes. I didnt use a truck. I used condensed biofuel as my only jetpack fuel. I never made advanced fuels. I never used a blueprint. My total power capacity at the end was only 20 000 MW. 10 000MW of that was being used by a single accelerator triple overclocked making the last 100 nuclear pasta I needed.

\- It is ok to temporarily do things manually

At each tier, I had some machine right next to my HUB making the resources to hit the space elevator goal. I was hand-carrying whatever I needed from the factory to the HUB and loading it into a container. The movement system is really fun! And sometimes just mindlessly doing runs with zip liners was a great way to relax after laying kilometers of conveyers. But once that resource changed from an end goal to an intermediate part, it has to be automated.

\- Change up what you're doing

Sometimes the game just needs time to run. Factories take time to balance out and saturate all the conveyors you've worked hard on. Take time to just wander around. Scout out new resources, hunt for somersloops and power slugs.

\- Do your MAM research!

If I had to do it over again, I would heavily prioritize clearing MAM research as much, if not more than clearing tiers. Many times it felt that I would come back to do research a little too late, and I missed out on having some extra equipment or recipe that would make my life so much easier. Also, there are some nodes that only unlock access to other nodes/trees. I was an idiot and thought those showed a padlock because I could not attempt to research them yet because I wasnt on a high enough tier.

\- Make the game work for you!

Color code your pipes. Turn off enemy aggression (I did). Play on controller (the controller support in 1.1 is really good). Turn on arachnophobia mode (those things are way creepy). The ultimate lesson for playing this game is to play it whatever way is actually fun for you.

\- Power power power

I had my power grid fail once. Right in the transition between biofuel and coal. It was really annoying to get back online. After that, I resolved to never let it drop again. I built a ton of power grid batteries and always ensured that my production was always 10-20% higher than my consumption. Often it was still below my max potential consumption, but that is more to do with me wanting my machines to always be slightly oversupplied by the previous one, so there was always a little downtime. If the grid started relying on batteries, I killed factory power supply and immediately headed over to improve power production.

Hopefully this helps someone who is struggling through the early or midgame to persevere. This game is  a ton of fun, and much like a Constructor, it gives out as much as you put in. I love seeing all the memes in this subreddit, and having 5+ years of posts to read though was super fun as a newcomer to this game.

I'm 22F and I'm going to university online, and I'm pretty sure i have inattentive adhd. I've been reading about it for a few weeks now, and I've seen advice in many subreddits with tips with initiation, not forgetting things, and focus. 

To be honest, I don't know of any of you relate, but it feels so hard to even incorporate those things into my life. I started doing the Google calendar widget on my phone, but some days I don't even follow through. 

I don't know of anyone relates, but in my mind it's, maybe I'm just lazy? Why can't I just push myself harder? Why can't I just do it? I don't want to be oh pity me, but it feels like I'm just at a lower baseline than most people. I try to let go of any shameful feelings I have but it's difficult sometimes.

My biggest struggle is just starting things. I’ll sit there thinking about how I need to do this thing, focus on something else, realize oh shit I really need to do this and then when i finally try to start, I can focus for 20-30 minutes if I try really hard and then I need a 10 minute break. It's so so hard to not zone out at what I'm supposed to be doing... like studying. Zero focus unless it’s mildly interesting or I'm stressed out of my mind. I've literally been going through school on coffee, lions mane, and brute forcing it. 

I'm temporarily in another state for two more months so I can’t get meds or even a diagnosis right now (insurance won’t cover it here). I've tried lion’s mane and I took it an hour with coffee before I studied for over a year and it definitely helped, but it doesn't after quite some bit, I have to take it then stop for months at a time and it's inconvenient.

I’m looking into L-tyrosine now, but I don't know how it works or if it's helped people with ADHD? I'm desperate for anything, I just want to be able to function ""normally""...

I don't know if I'm being dramatic but it feels the older I get the more trouble I'm having trying to just live my life?? or it's just that the consequences are more severe than when I was a child. I've always pushed things to the last minute, I've always fidgeted constantly, 24/7 chewing on my cheeks cracking my knuckles, I NEVER see others do this??

Seeing people online talk about how life isn't supposed to be this hard makes me just want to cry. I'm just so so envious that people can just do what they need without a second thought or relying on caffeine.  

Anyway, thank you all for reading. I'm going to make a coffee and wash my face with cold water because the matcha I made isn't enough to study. Have a good day! ",1,1750888422.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1lkip4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/curatedreviews/comments/1lkip4z/best_creatine_for_women_top_picks_that_actually/,Best Creatine for Women: Top Picks That Actually Work (2025 Review),"Look, I used to think creatine was just overpriced powder that didn't do much beyond placebo effect. Turns out I was dead wrong. Research shows it actually delivers real performance benefits when you use it consistently.

After dealing with constant workout fatigue and slow recovery, I decided to test some highly-rated options. Here's what I found after 3+ months of testing:

# [\#1: Lift Big Eat Big 100% Pure Creapure ](https://shop.liftbigeatbig.com/?ref=lpnmcicj)

**Price**: \~$35-39 (lasts 5+ months)  
**Taste**: Completely flavorless  
**Mixability**: 10/10 - dissolves instantly

# The Good:

* **German Creapure certification** = actually pure stuff
* Mixes into EVERYTHING (coffee, smoothies, even yogurt)
* Real results: +15lbs bench, +3 reps on squats, recovery time cut in half
* 200 servings per container = \~20¢ per day

# The Bad:

* More expensive than generic brands

**My experience**: This stuff is invisible. No taste, no texture, no BS. I went from needing 90 seconds rest between heavy squats to being ready at 60 seconds. Also gained 2lbs (water weight) but got noticeably stronger without getting ""bulky.""

# #2: Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate 

**Price**: \~$0.50/serving  
**Taste**: No taste/smell  
**Special feature**: Informed-Sport certified (drug tested athletes, this one's for you)

# The Good:

* **Perfect for smoothies** \- seriously game-changing
* AlzChem sourcing (German quality)
* Informed-Sport testing = safe for competitive athletes
* Great container design, no spills

# The Bad:

* Pricier than budget options
* Only 60 servings vs 200 in other brands

**My experience**: My 5-rep deadlift max went from 185→205lbs in 8 weeks. Grip strength stayed consistent through entire workouts. If you're someone who forgets to take supplements, mixing this into your morning smoothie is clutch.

# #3: Budget-Friendly Options

For those just starting out or on a tight budget, basic creatine monohydrate will still work. Just make sure it's:

* Pure creatine monohydrate (not a blend)
* Third-party tested
* From a reputable brand

# Real Results After 3 Months:

* Bench press: +15 pounds
* Squat endurance: +3 reps at working weight
* Sprint intervals: +30 seconds before fatigue
* Recovery soreness: 3 days → 1.5 days
* Weight gain: +2 lbs (water retention, leveled off)
* Clothes fit: Same size, better muscle definition

# FAQ based on DMs I always get:

**Q: Will I get bulky?** A: No. I gained 2lbs of water weight initially, then it leveled off. Got stronger and more defined, not bigger.

**Q: When do you take it?** A: Daily consistency matters more than timing. I mix it in my morning smoothie.

**Q: How long before you see results?** A: 2-3 weeks for me, but give it 4-6 weeks minimum.

**Q: Side effects?** A: None for me. Some people get stomach upset if they take too much at once.

# Bottom Line:

If you're tired of feeling exhausted during workouts and taking forever to recover, creatine might be your answer. Start with any pure creatine monohydrate and be consistent for at least a month.

**My pick**: [Lift Big Eat Big](https://shop.liftbigeatbig.com/?ref=lpnmcicj) if you want the best quality. Just stop overthinking it and try it already. Your future stronger self will thank you.",3,1750888315.0,curatedreviews,0,1.0,False

1lkio0s,https://i.redd.it/kkvoxz3o959f1.jpeg,Started from a DF54 now we here,"Rate my setup. 

Couldn’t return the DF54 but my advice would be to get the Lagom Casa instead. Really good quality beginner’s grinder for a little more money. Keeping the DF for pour over or maybe for camping or something but it’s clogging, messiness, and glue I found all over the inside was a turn off. Overall, the espresso setup has continued to improve and now I think I’m set for awhile. 

On the left is a match bowl and whisk. Been doing matcha + espresso + honey iced drinks and it’s an absolute game changer. Got matcha and the best coffee beans I’ve ever had in Japan. They make for quite the combo.

TLDR My elder dog passed and my BF threw a  party...to fucking celebrate


Alt account, fake names -

  
I F35 have been with my BF Caleb M37 for a year now as of last June 16th. We literally just celebrated our anniversary. When my dad passed away last year, I sort of inherited Pepper (his 13 year old black lab) who is the sweetest pup alive. 

  
I won't make excuses, but when pepper passed away this past Thursday, I was absolutely devastated. I could not stop crying. I keep house for my BF as he is the only one working right now (I was downsized last month and this just became the norm until I get a job.) and I couldn't make lunch. I pulled myself together enough to make dinner. He was annoyed enough to mutter ""Are you fucking kidding me"" when I started crying again and it hurt. I just tried to be quiet the rest of the time.

Well last night a bunch of his friends came over. First, I wasn't surprised. He lived in this house for a while, and got it from his parents, so he's been in the area forever. He has a lot of friends...so when the 1st, 2nd, 3rd person showed up, I didn't much think about it and just pointed them to the den where BF was. But then 4th-like maybe 10th? showed and I was like, what is happening?

I dropped in the den to check and see how things were going and one of his friends shouted ""The guest of honor!"" before my BF whacked his arm. I kind of laughed it off and it wasn't until one of the guys came by to offer condolences about Pepper that I asked what was going on. He looked a little uncomfy and then said it was a stupid joke but it was a party to for congrats to my BF because we are now ""child-free"". I asked what does that mean? And he said that it's like when a kid goes to college sort of, we're now empty nesters. 

  
I was upset and he left quickly so I went back to the den to ask my BF about this but then I saw a makeshift card that said ""Congrats, the b\*tch is in a ditch"" I was stunned. BF saw me staring and grabbed it, turning to his friend saying it was a bad joke and to not worry about it blaming his friend. That's when everyone started mumbling. I can't give a full account of what exactly happened because I got so upset. I did ask everyone to leave. All but 1 did. And my BF started arguing with me about it being his house and I have no right to kick out his friends or stop his party - I asked him to tell me the truth, was this a party thrown because Pepper is gone? He didn't really answer but the friend who stayed behind confirmed it was.

I slept on the couch last night and left early for a job interview but I don't want to go back there. I love my BF but this was just...cruel. He did notice I never came to bed and got my coffee ready with a good luck note attached as he WFM and was in his home office - but I didn't take it. I just took Pepper's leashes and collars and went to my interview. 

  
This is so far out of left field. He's not like this???? I'm just so sad. He's on my main account so I made this to vent. How do I even talk to him about this? Whenever I think about it, I just want to lose it, shout at him and tell him to stick his audacity where the sun don't shine but tbh, I'm not a confrontational person. I don't like when people shout. I just feel so lost right now.

WIBTAH if I stayed away a bit? I don't even want to look at him, let alone talk to him.",1,1750887951.0,u_BurgerOfTheGay,0,1.0,False
1lkij6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1lkij6r/one_year_in_and_im_stuck/,"One year in, and I'm stuck...","Hi All,

I have been ""Peating"" seriously for a little over a year now, and I have gotten stuck. My experience so far has been a lot of ""one step forward, two steps back"". In the past month, I feel like my metabolism, which had just barely gotten off the ground, crashed and burned, and I am almost back to where I was when I began. This is extremely frustrating.

**About me:** 35 y/o male, 5'6"", 155 lb, a fair bit of belly fat, water retention, gyno, etc.

I am experiencing classic hypothyroid, high estrogen/cortisol/serotonin symptoms:

* low appetite, get bloated easily
* weight gain, even with few calories
* fatigue, but inability to sleep deeply
* irritability, low resilience to stress
* low-grade depression that is impossible to shake
* no dreams, low interest in hobbies, sociability, etc

My temps / pulse are not too bad though, usually within standard ""Peaty"" parameters or only slightly low, and I am sweating appropriately upon exertion.

**My current diet:**

* Higher starch (mostly rice and sweet potato)
* Coconut oil as primary fat
* Cooked veggies (mushrooms, squash, greens, etc)
* Salting food to taste
* Coffee with some sugar, though I am not enjoying sweet things currently
* Some flounder/cod, about 1x week
* Some beef stew, about 1-2x week
* small amounts of fruit (mostly melon)
* 1-2 eggs / week
* 1-2 cans sardines with bones / week
* occasional chicken liver, hard to get decent quality

I was at 1900-2100 cal per day for a while, but post ""crash"" I am now down to barely 1500 calories per day, over three meals, with aforementioned symptoms. Currently, I don't think I could eat more even if I wanted too.

I did not feel great with higher protein intake, and so have been experimenting with lower protein currently (about 55-70 g / day). This seems to at least help stave off the weight gain.

I do not tolerate fruit, sugar, or dairy well (severe bloating, gas, weight gain, etc), hence the higher starch intake.

Carrot salad does nothing for me.

**Supplements that I do ok with:**

* aspirin (325 mg/day)
* Vit E, 200-300 IU/day
* b complex, 1-2x/week
* thiamine hcl, 1-2x/week
* activated charcoal, 1-2x / month

Over the past year, I have discovered that I respond poorly to most supplements, and have tried to minimize my stack.

I have had very bad reactions to thyroid (throat swelling, breathing issues), even at low doses, and have also reacted very poorly to pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA (migraines, irritability, acne). Likewise, I have had either no effect or really bad effects from Calcium, Vit C, A, D, and K, even at normal, ""maintenance"" doses.

I am a little concerned that I may have overdone hormones and supplements early on and really messed up something internally.

Not really sure how to proceed. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Thanks.",1,1750887911.0,raypeat,4,1.0,False
1lkii4h,https://i.redd.it/c43xjqbh859f1.png,💍 He Said Yes – Benjamin & Mason Are Engaged! 💫❤️,"In a family built on second chances and lifelong love,
Benjamin Faylor and Mason O'Neil just wrote their next chapter: they’re engaged.

It wasn’t grand or flashy.
There was no audience, no speeches, no hidden photographers.
Just two dads, two mugs of coffee, and the soft morning light pouring through their kitchen window—
Henry laughing in the other room. Catherine singing nonsense to her stuffed rabbit.
Jimbo snoring at their feet.

And Mason pulled out a ring.

He didn’t get on one knee.
He just asked. Quietly. Honestly. With eyes that have seen Benjamin at his best, his worst, and everything in between.

And Benjamin? He said yes without hesitation.
Because this wasn’t the start of something—it was the recognition of everything they’ve already built.

From late-night baby bottles to Disney trips to talking about grief and healing and choosing love anyway—
They’ve done the work.
They’ve been the team.
They are the love story that grew slowly, bravely, and beautifully.

The kids are over the moon.
Charlotte cried. James shook Mason’s hand and then pulled him into a hug.
Even Jimbo barked (once) in approval.

There’s no wedding date yet. No rush. No pressure.
Just a promise.
To keep showing up.
To keep choosing each other.
To keep growing this wild, beautiful life they’ve made—together.

💍 Benjamin & Mason – engaged, steady, and soul-deep in love

\--

# # Introduction

Lot of trainers just read our exam book front to back, take a practice quiz and pass on the first or second try, usually forgetting it all in a few months.

You can do that, CPT exams aren’t that hard, but it’s also pretty damn inefficient for internalizing the material and understanding the concepts, especially on more advanced exams like the CSCS.

And if you want to competently teach something, you have to **understand** it, not just **know** it.

Unfortunately [what these certs don't teach you](https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/comments/1khwa0h/personal_training_harsh_truths_guide_for_new/) will be the essential tools you need to perform well in your career, but that’s another post for another day.

Today it’s just the study methods you can apply to any educational opportunity or resource, starting with passing your base certification.

Fortunately you don’t have to do all this stuff for great results, pick 1 or 2 relevant pieces to start with.

>*Credit - Much of this is distilled from notes taken from Cal Newport’s Deep Work and How to Be a Straight-A Student (great books, read them) along with my common journal notes from a half dozen other sources I never bothered to label.*

Avg. Reading Time = 6 min 57 sec

# # How to Retain Information

1. Listen to information = Retain a little bit of it.
2. Read the information = Retain a little bit more.
3. Write the information down = Retain a lot more of it.
4. But when you TEACH the information = You retain the most.

Practice 3 and 4 as much as you can for the most efficient long-term memory retention.

\--

# # Set a Goal

* Why are you studying the material in the first place. **Write that down.**
* Write down the stakes, what’s going to happen in your life if you study the material, what’s going to happen if you don’t. What going to happen if you pass the exam, what’s going to happen if you don’t.
* No stakes = no action = no transformation.
* Set a date for when you will sit for your exam. Book that date so you’re locked into taking action.
* Keep this somewhere where you will regularly see it.

\--

# # Beating Procrastination

>*Losers have goals, winners create systems for their goals.*

Keep a progress journal / app tracker for your **Most Important Tasks** (Ivy Lee Method).

* At the beginning or end of each day, write down the 6 most important tasks you need to complete for the day for making progress in your life.
* Rank them 1-6, put all your effort into accomplishing them in order.
* If a task is too large to complete in 15-30 minutes, then break the task down into smaller chunks.
* If you‘ve gone pro at procrastination, break it down into 2-5 minutes.
* Don’t fuck around with unimportant / non urgent things that aren’t on the list until you’ve at least knocked a few out. Even if you only complete 1 or 2, given enough time you’ll be miles ahead.

If you don’t enjoy the task, make an event of it, or pair it to a location you do enjoy. Perhaps stundying in a coffee shop, park, etc etc

Add friction to your distractions. Leave the phone in another room, turn off the wi-fi, leave the house, etc etc

Optimal studying hours according to studies is the early morning and afternoon.

Plan your studying days in advance, then honor your calendar.

Use study pockets: 5-30 minute study intervals during dead time, such as waiting on a commute or eating lunch. Anytime you scroll your phone is probably an example of dead time you can turn into a study pocket.

Return to your goals and stakes often. No stakes = no action.

\--

# # Deepening Focus

Use isolation to deepen focus, use friction to kill distractions, such as leaving your phone in another room, or in your car while you go to the library.

Focus on deep work, not pseudo-work. Deep work moves you closer to your goal. Pseudo-work is intellectual masturbation that keeps you spinning in place while giving you the illusion of progress.

>*Parkinson’s Law - Tasks expand to the time allotted to their completion.*

Set time limits and due dates for yourself.

**Take breaks.** Don’t skip them.

* Every hour take a break for at least 5-10 minutes.
* A proven routine is 2 sessions of 40 minutes work, 5 minute breaks, done daily on a given topic.
* Studies show you dramatically decrease retention and exam scores when failing to take breaks when pushing study sessions longer than 2 hours.
* A good break should completely unplug you from the study task.
* When choosing your break, choose one you can stick with.
* If you start fucking around on TikTok will you honestly stop at 5 or 10 minutes? If not, choose something else.

\--

# # Taking Notes

If you decide to sign up for a CPT course with online videos such as NASM, treat these as you would college lectures.

Always take notes during these videos to deepen your retention, even if the videos feel like a waste of time.

Use shorthand when taking notes, don’t worry about legibility if your handwriting sucks.

* And format
   * your notes
      * aggressively.

Capture the big ideas with **QEC**. Big ideas is usually what you're going to be tested on.

1. Identify the central **question** being discussed. 
2. What **evidence** are they providing.
3. What **conclusion** are they drawing.

When completing a seminar or online video, take a few minutes afterwards to read your notes to fully absorb them.

If you are able, participate during seminars for the greatest degree of retention and understanding. Ask questions, raise your hand. Don’t worry about looking stupid, everyone is there to learn.

\--

# # Reading Assignments

Studies show the highest performing Ivy League students don’t do all of the assigned reading, how could they. Have you ever seen their reading lists, they’re insane, yet they still score top marks.

Top students decide what to target and what to ignore.

When it comes to reading, you need to correctly identify which reading falls into which bucket.

1. What do I **need to read**.
2. What can I **skim**.
3. What can I **skip entirely**.

Never do ALL of the assigned reading, learn to discern the above three, and the three within your favored sources such as your primary textbook.

Example - For my NSCA exam I didn’t rely on my primary source (NSCA-CPT textbook) to teach me anatomy and physiology, because it sucks at that.

Instead I used their recommended reading of *Strength Training Anatomy by Delavier* which was far superior in learning terms, and more importantly, in understanding and teaching them.

And again when reading, focus on extracting key information with QEC.

1. Identify the central **question** being discussed. 
2. What **evidence** are they providing. You generally only need to read 1-2 examples to get the point.
3. What **conclusion** are they drawing.

Read your primary textbook chapters twice.

1st Pass = A dirty skim, should take 30 minutes or less.

2nd Pass =  Focus on extracting the information you marked in your 1st pass, condensing it down into pointed and pertinent notes. Generally you want to target QEC information.

Reading is a skill, over time you’ll get faster and identify the 3 buckets and QEC within your textbook with lightning speed.

\--

# # Build a Study Guide

Identify the areas you struggle with the most, then build a study guide.

As an example, I found the CSCS annoying on how they explain their programming methodology, so I spent most of my study guide there.

When building your study guide look for:

1. What chapters, topics, lectures and reading assignments do I need to improve on.
2. What kinds of questions am I struggling with? You can use the sample questions from the back of each chapter to gauge this.
3. What formulas do I need to memorize.

Write down the QEC information you gathered from your reading and begin to copy that by hand into your study guide.

Writing = better retention of the information.

**Flash Cards** \- Great for terms and concepts. Don’t review your flash cards the same day you make them.  Start that the following day for deeper memory retention.

Say answers out loud when using flash cards for the best results, review your flash cards at every opportunity.

\--

# # Challenging Topics = Feynman Method

1. Write down the concept you are struggling with at the top of a sheet of paper.
2. Write down your explanation of the concept in plain English as best you understand it, pretend you are explaining this to a 5 year old.
3. Pinpoint what you don’t know or don’t understand.
4. Go back to the source material and review it. Reread and relearn.
5. Simplify your language as much as possible, use simple analogy’s wherever possible.

\--

# # Taking Your Exam

For multiple-choice questions:

* Read the question in its entirety at least once, read each answer, and if needed read the question again slowly.
* Most CPT exams will have a lot of questions with multiple “right” answers, pick the one that sounds the most “right” in these scenarios.
* Use process of elimination, and if stuck between two, go with your gut, statistically whichever you go with first is usually the right one.

Some questions are nonsensical or poorly worded, these may be future test bank questions they are evaluating that will be ungraded. Don’t let them throw you off balance.

If your exams doesn’t have a set amount of time to answer each question, set a time budget for each question. Take  the total test time, divide by number of questions =  max time to spend per question.

Don’t be afraid to skip difficult questions if possible, answer the easy questions first.

Don’t worry about blowing your test. The only way you can do that is putting off taking it. Worst case scenario, you fail, you fill in your gaps, and you take it again. No big deal.

\--

# # Troubleshooting

**I’m stuck with X, Y and Z.**

When stuck use all available resources to get unstuck. Search google, use the Feynman method, talk to mentors or instructors, post pointed and pertinent questions on Reddit, etc etc.

**Studying is too hard.**

Studying shouldn’t be “hard” when done correctly. If it’s hard, then you want to identify what specifically is hard about it and alter your approach.

Hard because distractions? Create friction and isolation. Hard because losing focus? Change time and breaks. Don’t have time? Make time, days in advance.

Studying may be difficult at times, but it shouldn’t be painful.

\--

# # Closing Thoughts

Studying is a skill, and when you approach it with an efficient framework, you’ll get better results in less time, without having to resort to inefficient brute-force methods.

You’ll also better understand and remember the shit you learned too.

And all those notes you took?

Well when you‘ve gotten a bit blurry on this stuff a few years from now, you’ll be able to review and refresh in mere minutes. Beats having to read the material all over again.

But passing your CPT exam is just the first step.

If you plan to be the [20% that stick around longer than 2 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/comments/1khwa0h/personal_training_harsh_truths_guide_for_new/), you’re gonna have a lot of continuing education in your future.

Fortunately, everything we covered here will apply to maximizing those opportunities as well.

I’d wish you luck in your studies, but you won’t need it anymore.

When I slow-feed my X-Ultra, the cups taste *substantially better* across almost all the specialty coffees I’m brewing — light roasts, both washed and process-forward naturals/fermentations/honeys. The issue is that grinding sideways to slow-feed takes so long and the x-ultra is too small for my hands..

**Questions:**

* Does slow-feeding an X/K-Ultra get similar results to a clarity-focused grinder like a ZP6?
* Will a clarity-focused grinder *really* limit my results across heavy-processed beans (even if they’re good quality)?

**Bonus question**:

* Roughly how long does it take to slow-feed a K-Ultra — i.e. holding it almost horizontal and steadily feeding the beans?

  
If the k-ultras can get ZP6 like results with slow feeding and the ZP6 is picky even with quality beans, then the k-ultra might be my best bet.

Personally, I'm just a perpetually lazy and broke dude. I suspect ADHD or something, but that's another topic. I was vegan for 4 years.

I knew *how* to eat a balanced PB diet, but I didn't always have the motivation to cook or the money to buy 20 different foods (although, I will maintain that WFPB is cheap as dirt. I was just that broke.) So, I think I was not eating enough protein, fat, and calories in general a lot of days. I know my ferritin got down to 30, but I also drank coffee with breakfast and lunch every day. 

When I was on top of everything, I think it was a great diet and I felt full of energy. I'm just kind of a fuck-up and couldn't sustain it. Surely some of y'all can admit the same and aren't strictly here to shitpost and hate veganism?",0,1750887257.0,exvegans,5,0.25,False

Hi Reddit Gentlemen!

I’m looking for genuine dates and fun company—someone to explore new places and share good conversations with.

About me:
I’m a slim, stylish (5’6”) with soft skin and a confident presence. I work in the creative field—very into arts and fashion. I’m also fascinated by science, especially biology and psychology. Music and pets? Love them. Coffee? Can’t live without it. NCR-based.

About you:
Preferably fit or within a healthy BMI. Gym rats or athletic types are a plus. You’re hygienic, decent-looking, and easygoing. A plus if you’re from a Big 4 uni. I’m more drawn to guys who look youthful and know how to hold a great convo with proper etiquette.

When messaging:
Kindly include your ASL and a short intro. Bonus points if you tell me something cool about yourself.

1lki7pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq5/comments/1lki7pk/joined_the_ioniq_5_club_and_brought_my_uxdesigner/,Joined the Ioniq 5 club and brought my UX-designer brain along (Hi Hyundai),"https://preview.redd.it/lmy4zigj559f1.jpg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432f684a00bee269ec0ce3c4a61984d8b67d0b1

**TL;DR:**  
Love my Ioniq 5 after nearly 2 months. It looks amazing and drives beautifully, but from a UX design lens, a few features feel unintuitive: lock/unlock button layout, no casual lane assist, overly intense parking beeps, jump-scare warnings, and one-time-only blind spot alerts. Curious what others think—and if you’ve found any funny system messages (we found the coffee break one).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Hey everyone! I’ve had my **grey Ioniq 5** for just under two months now—and I still pause to admire it like it’s a piece of modern art. The lines, the interior, the feel—it’s a great experience overall.

That said, I’m a UX designer, so I can’t help but notice when things feel just a bit off in the interaction flow. Nothing here is a dealbreaker—just interesting observations from a user experience perspective that I figured I’d share.

**Lock vs. Unlock: Muscle-Memory Mayhem**  
Most cars I’ve owned have lock on the left, unlock on the right. The Ioniq 5 flips that. It’s a small thing, but just watching my family fumble for a week or two from outside the door, trying to remember which button is which, has been a weirdly funny challenge.

**Lane Assist & Driver Monitor**  
Yes, lane assist is available—but only when you manually activate it on the freeway. And it’s not just lane assist; it’s essentially the Highway Driving Assist co-pilot mode that’s kind of like semi-self-driving. I was surprised there wasn’t a more casual lane assist option for normal driving, or something that just kicks in automatically at certain speeds.

Also, the driver attention camera can be overly sensitive. If my hand goes over the steering wheel sensor (which is centered), it triggers the alert telling me to look straight ahead—even when I already am.

**Parking Beeps = Instant Panic**  
The proximity alerts are *loud* and start *early*. Sometimes I’m still a solid distance from anything and it’s already panicking. I’d love a gentler ramp-up that only hits full intensity when I’m actually in the red zone. Right now, it’s a bit much for tight spaces.

**Surprise Alerts**  
When I got down to 10% battery, the car gave me a full-screen warning and a sharp tone. Totally fair—but a little heads-up before the alert would be nice. These sudden warnings feel more jump-scare than helpful sometimes.

**Blind Spot Feedback: One-and-Done?**  
When I use my turn signal and there’s a car in my blind spot, the system gives me a ping and a wheel vibration—which I like. But if another car enters the blind spot shortly after, there’s no second ping. The light in the mirror stays on, but the feedback doesn’t repeat. It feels like the warning system gives up too early

All that said—I really do love this car. These little UX quirks only stand out *because* everything else feels so well done.

Would love to hear what others think! Have you noticed any of the same things? Any weird/funny alerts pop up for you? We found the “time for a coffee break” one and honestly couldn’t stop laughing.

Glad to be part of the Ioniq 5 community. Also do we have a fun item to put on peoples car like jeep does with the duck? For the kona I always wanted to put a stop cone. Was thinking an acrylic ice cube for the coolest car or even a 'sysstem alert' or warning that says to cool for the road idk",0,1750887127.0,Ioniq5,1,0.5,False

I’m Lebanese-Latina (mom’s Lebanese, dad’s Colombian—my grandma is half-Pashtun lol) and I love seeing girls supporting each other but… am I the only one who feels the “glow up” advice is just not made for us?

Like, every time I see a thread it’s about fixing “desi hair” or “battling South Asian dark circles” or stuff that just doesn’t work for me. My hair is naturally wavy/curly (think Amal Clooney/Moroccan/telenovela style, not the typical coarse South Asian type) and I get so many weird looks from people, even in brown girl spaces, when I talk about my routine. Everyone’s obsessed with oiling, but if I do that my hair literally just goes limp. I have to use like, argan oil and coffee scrubs (thank you, grandma) just to get that “glow,” and it honestly feels like no one in these spaces talks about MENA or Latina routines unless it’s like, a side note.

Even makeup tips! I have more olive/amber undertones so half the time the “shade matching” threads are useless, and don’t get me started on threading or waxing horror stories! I tried threading ONCE and my brows have never recovered lmao. Anyone else find the brown girl beauty standards are just so specific to South Asian features? Like, sometimes I see posts about “embracing brownness” but it feels like code for one type of brown, you know?

Not gonna lie, I had a huge insecurity complex about my hair/skin/features growing up. It wasn’t until uni when I started hanging out with other Latinas as well as MENA and Central Asian girls (shoutout to the Uzbek/Pashtun girls with the best cheekbones ever) that I realized maybe we’re just not meant to follow the same tips as everyone else promoting ""brown girl glow ups"".

Anyway, sorry for the rant—I just wish more “brown girl” spaces would talk about the diversity of “brown” beauty, not just one group’s struggles. And yes, before anyone says anything, I *do* love and support all my South Asian sisters, I just feel like sometimes it’s a bit exclusionary!

(Btw, my boyfriend—who’s Turkish-Italian with the best jawline and green eyes keeps telling me my curls and olive skin are what makes me stand out most, so maybe I should stop trying to fit a box that isn’t even made for me lol.)

1lki6jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lki6jz/seeing_my_ex_in_three_hours_and_im_freaking_out/,Seeing my ex in three hours and I’m freaking out,"I am seeing my ex of three months in three hours at a coffee shop. I sent her a text and we have been talking since then.

She says that she still loves me and hasn’t moved on. When I asked her to meet up she didn’t hesitate at all and said she would love to meet up.

Is there a chance at rekindling this relationship or am I going in with false hopes.",1,1750887052.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False
1lki6bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/newtothenavy/comments/1lki6bk/the_way_of_the_swo_for_those_who_ask/,"The way of the SWO, for those who ask","Written by a recent small boy CO.

What is the way of the SWO? Is there a unique SWO culture?  I think there is and here is my first cut at trying to describe it. 

SWOs are driven to seek perfection in all they do. They will work extremely long hours just because. They are driven by a Darwinian sense of competition but also by Catholic guilt and the Protestant work ethic. SWOs emphasize the negative and never want to purposefully show their blemishes for fear of criticism. Often times we can be cantankerous and irritable due to long hours of watch, too much coffee and lack of sleep. We often forget that we are the guardians of the world's sea lines of communication as we tend to focus on the small details inside larger problems. As SWOs get more and more senior they truly believe they can do more with less, as they have been told this all their careers.

Accountability is driven into the SWO mind at a very early age. SWOs will be held accountable for their mistakes and should hold their subordinates accountable especially when it is most difficult and uncomfortable to do so. SWOs are proud and often look back nostalgically at their tours, forgetting the bad times and remembering the good. When we are at sea we often complain about the hard work and seemingly needless inspections but when we get ashore we long for sea duty again. SWOs are traditionalists and crave the tribal storytelling ways of their seagoing forefathers. SWOs pride themselves on the time they have spent at sea in some of the worst parts of the globe. We sometimes speak of our near misses and wipe our brows and whisper, ""there for the Grace of God go I. . ."".

When I was XO one of my best JOs came to me, and she said that she did not like what she had become. She was aggressive and could get things done right quickly. She did not tolerate stupidity on the bridge and often exploded at her subordinates. She would get emotional when people criticized her leadership style and often push back hard. Both the Capt and I felt that she was one of the best young JOs onboard, and that there was no project she could not accomplish. She had become a SWO and she did not like it. It was not that she was not proud of her accomplishments or the SWO pin on her uniform but how her personality had changed and had become much more aggressive and intolerant of those who were not as capable. I told her that she had become an old-fashioned SWO in every sense, and she then decided to become an HR officer.

The point of the story is that the way of the SWO is different and difficult, and perhaps not for everyone. You have to love the sea and being a professional mariner, but also strive to lead people with a strong sense of duty and selflessness.   SWO culture is unique and is born from years spent at sea.  It has to be experienced a priori.  Not a lot of movies or books about it recently. . . .but it is real. ",1,1750887038.0,newtothenavy,1,1.0,False
1lki5oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1lki5oo/if_you_only_knew/,If you only knew,"A house full of ghosts from you and all that you left behind, 

I am haunted by the coffee table full of arguments

The plants that you'll never see grow again

The shelves we never filled with books


The speakers we never heard play music

The coffee mugs we shared our mornings with
You left behind so much and it has completely broken me 

I'm not perfect, my condition makes me unstable

But I do know that I truly did love you 

With all that is in me

But I changed so much

And i still am grieving what could of been

It isn't easy

I want to tell you so much

But I know that its a waste

Im still heartbroken from you 

In this small town everyone knows

I'm the girl who lives with your ghosts 

I could never say this to you

I’ve been living in Paris for about 3 years now, and trust me, making friends here can be a challenge. People either vanish or the vibe just doesn’t click.

So here I am, looking to meet new people to hang out with, try new activities, explore the city, and really just enjoy life in our 20s.

I live inside Paris and I am fluent in French, Arabic, English and now learning Spanish, so if you’re up for anything, a coffee, a walk, trying that new thing and need company, just DM me!

It's your boy, Mike, here, and if you're reading this, it means you've probably stumbled through some cosmic bullshit to get here, or you're just really good at clicking links. Either way, welcome to the official subreddit for... well, *my* life.

Yeah, I know, ""Mike, Monster Hunter Extraordinaire"" – don't ask, long story involving a lot of near-deaths and a certain condescending dagger. Point is, if you've been reading along, you know it's been a ride. From my soul being ripped from Earth (still salty about that AC, by the way) to a Valley that's basically Hard Mode Summer Camp , and then Wyrrhollow, where the guards try to beat you over the head before asking questions , and the squirrels are literally the Devil's army.



This place is for all of us. The ""misplaced,"" the adventurers (accidental or otherwise), the ones who've faced down their inner demons (and outer monsters) and probably just sighed afterwards. If you're into existential dread, questionable life choices, accidental heroism, and a whole lot of sarcastic complaining, you've found your people.

Here's what we're going to do here:

* **Complain about our landlords/bosses/sentient weaponry:** Because therapy is expensive, and who needs it when you have a subreddit?
* **Share survival tips:** Like, seriously, if anyone figures out how to skin a Mossbuck without looking like a serial killer, hit me up. And don't forget to eat the purple fruits.
* **Debate the true nature of cosmic horror:** Is the giant smiley face a god, or just a cosmic asshole? Discuss.
* **Fan theories and general weirdness:** Got a theory about the Mad King of Ash? Or why everything here wants to murder us? Lay it on me. Just try not to get*too* deep, my brain is still recovering.
* **Memes, obviously:** Because if you can't laugh at your impending doom, what's the point?

Just remember the rules:

1. Don't be a dick. (Unless you're Garrus, then it's expected).
2. No spoilers past the current chapters, for new folks.
3. Try not to die. Or do. You'll probably wake up in a bed again anyway.

So, grab your imaginary coffee (mine tastes like apples and nuts now, weirdly), pull up a rickety cot, and let's get this party started. Don't worry, the town guard probably won't find us here. Probably.

Today officially marks the time where I've finally left and deleted my accounts on Grindr and Blued (now Heesay) and I've never been more happier. The experience has been wild, both literally and figuratively. While I've had my fair share of encounters– from decent to bad– it has been an eye opening experience for me in general. I've learned a lot in those times. But I always knew, deep down, na commitment talaga ang gusto ko. It is also important to note that I've gone through 2 serious relationships in the past before I tried out these apps, so I didn't really lose my v card to a random hookup (which I'm thankful for.)

I once strayed off the path I'm taking because of traumatic life events (got taken advantage of by someone I thought I could trust) that shifted my perspective on my worth and how I should be treated by men. From that point on my views on myself got twisted and sadly, that snowballed into me letting men use me as they wished. Month after month, I never once said no, even go as far as to travel across cities to visit their place to let them do as they pleased.

But in moments of clarity, time and time again I would find myself nurturing a relationship with someone I met on those apps, still hoping I could find someone real. And I could say I do have a few guys I've met there who I've been mutual friends with for months, almost a year now across all my socials.

And I realized that hookup culture isn't my thing, and that I'd rather date to marry, like I've always wanted to. Because that's just me, a guy who just wanted to find the love he always dreamed of. I want to wake up everyday next to someone who makes me smile as the sunlight hits his face. I want to get up every morning to prepare two cups of coffee paired with breakfast for someone who I'll eat with for the rest of my days. I want someone to hold me tight when things go awry and tell me he'll always be there for me no matter what. I want to be excited for the day to end just so I could run back to someone I will always call my home. 

And with those thoughts spiralling in my head something snapped in me and I finally FINALLY deleted my accounts on those apps as I was walking home from work. And I'm not gonna come back. I'm a shameless hopeless romantic who wants to commit, and I'm not gonna stray from that path again.

It will take time to meet someone, alam ko yun, pero hindi ako susuko. I'm only in my early 20s, there will be a lot more men I'll meet along the way, pero jusko Lord wag niyo na po patagalin hahahaha! Ready na ko makilala siya, at gusto ko na siya makilala.

For a bit of background info, I'm a 28 y/o female, healthy, I don't drink or smoke, exercise regularly, eat healthy and I'm a healthy weight. I have been having GERD symptoms since 2021/22 and attended with my GP (I'm from UK) many many times over the years. My symptoms consist of acid reflux, heartburn, fullness, lack of appetite, bad breath, dry mouth, bitter and sour taste, abdominal, chest and throat pain, hoarseness and a productive cough after eating. 

In 2023 I was referred to an upper GI specialist to get an upper endoscopy and I'm still on the waiting list. I've been prescribed with omeprazole which did nothing for my symptoms and then lansoprazole 30mg a day which seemed to help a little but not a whole lot as I still experience symptoms on the daily. 

2 weeks ago my symptoms really kicked up a notch, to the point where I couldn't bend over without the reflux coming up into my mouth. A few days after the reflux got worse, I was sitting at work and noticed  taste of blood in my mouth and then proceeded to spit the blood up. This repeated itself for a number of days and my reflux was the worst it has ever been. I went back to my GP and was told that they couldn't do anything until I got the scope so they increased my lansoprazole to 60mg a day and sent me on my merry way. Since my referral was classed as 'routine' I was still quite far down the waiting list and decided it was time to go private. 

I got the scope on Monday which showed a small hiatal hernia (2cm) and irregularities in the Z line of my oesophagus. 2 biopsies were taken and I'm due to see the consultant again on the 10th July. There is also reference to barrets oesophagus on the report, although, I need to get the results from the biopsy before this can be determined (I think).

I'm at the stage where no matter what I eat, I'm symptomatic. Over the last week and a half I have dropped 2kg because I'm worried that whatever I do eat will make matters worse and medication like rennie or gaviscon don't really help long term. 

In terms of triggers, I avoid anything too fatty and spicy. I'm not a fan of carbonated drinks and before my symptoms worsened I would have had 1 cup of coffee every now and again. My job is very stressful but I'm not sure how much that contributes. 

After my scope, I did some research and came across fundoplication surgery along with hernia repair. I guess my question is, is it worth it? Is it effective? Is this something I should be considering, given that the PPIs I've been on don't work? I keep thinking that I'm only 28 years old and I'm concerned that the continous exposure to acid could cause more damage to my oesophagus over the years. 

I would really appreciate to hear your experiences/stories/advice.

It is shocking and sad just how many of us have been in similar situations. 

I just came across this message I sent during my relationship with my ex. Reading it now, I can’t believe how clearly I was voicing what I needed, and how little it was being heard. At the time, I felt unsure, maybe even like I was asking for too much. Now I realise I was asking for the bare minimum: presence, intention, and emotional partnership. Sharing this in case someone else out there is in the same cycle of feeling dismissed or depleted, maybe this helps you feel less alone. 

**He said: 

“Loving me is:

1. Being my place of peace not my place of conflict.
2. Being happy with what I can do and provide not dissatisfied with what I can't.
3. Allowing me the space to pursue what is purposeful to me without thinking it's going to cause a problem.
4. Accepting differences not denying them or pretending they don't exist.

There's a start...”

**My response:

“I have done every one of those things. 

It seems you asking me to be your place of peace is used to pacify me when I am raising valid concerns. You don’t want to be held accountable and instead, want me to be happy with being in a relationship with a stranger who could not be bothered with making the relationship a place of peace for me TOO. 

It seems like you’re happy to make time and put in effort for work trips (holiday) or arranging lunch and coffee with your friends (even with [NAME REDACTED] who needs to be emailed!), but when it comes to us doing things together - whether it’s going on a date, planning a weekend away, or just trying something new—you’re not as engaged or willing to take initiative. I don’t mind taking the lead sometimes, but it feels like you’re leaving it all up to me, and that is really exhausting. It tells me you’re not willing to ACTUALLY think of what makes me happy and how you can contribute to that at times. It tells me this relationship is of no value/purpose to you, other than the sex and companionship you get from it. Hell! You couldn’t even tell me what what things YOU have done to make me feel loved. I’m not talking about you compromising and agreeing to go away with friends. I’m talking about an INDEPENDENT thought that has come from you, saying, I know my girlfriend would appreciate this, let me do this thing for her that she likes….

I also don’t expect us to do everything I enjoy, but I would love for us to find more things that we both enjoy doing - together. Even with the differences, you/we aren’t ACTIVELY looking for areas of mutual satisfaction and connection.  

I have never had a problem with your job and what you do. I think deep down, you are the one that has unresolved thoughts about it, perhaps because it isn’t a clear path. And you attach your value to it, which I can understand, but to the point where you have nothing to give in your relationships with people who care about you. And until you have direction in your career, until you can feel like a leader / accomplished in your career, it seems you will not lead in other areas. 

You say I must be happy with what you can do and provide - those things I ask for, you are definitely capable of doing and providing! Once again, I see you doing them in other areas of your life. It’s not for a lack of ability, but truly a lack of WILLINGNESS, whether it is intentional or not. And YOU need to decide whether you’re going to put in effort towards having a purposeful and meaningful relationship, or if you can’t be bothered. If you want peace, you have to facilitate that environment. That is also your responsibility. When you GIVE peace, you get peace. 

The men you refer to as ‘soft’ - I hate to break it to you, but they are in happy and meaningful relationships and ALSO pursuing careers they’re interested in. That is not to say change who you are, but to highlight that you can prefer solitude AND still be in a meaningful and purposeful relationship and pursue your career. Those things can coexist but you can’t neglect one and think there will be peace.

I am not a background actor in your life. I am a Co star and deserve to be treated as such. I do not want to beg for what many would consider the bare minimum. I want to be in a relationship with someone who is madly in love with me and at every opportunity they get, do not fail to show me that. Someone who is IN the relationship, not one foot in and the other foot in a dark place. Someone who has a plan for his career AND relationship. The pursuit does not have to be perfect, but it certainly has to be there. We already spend a lot of time away from each other, to say I require a lot from you, is a statement you need to rethink. 

I want to feel like we’re building something together, and that means compromise from both of us. I know you care about me, and I hope we can find a way to show that care in a way that makes us both happy. It’s not about doing things you don’t enjoy, but about making sure we’re both playing an active role in this relationship and making it stronger.

I love you and want this relationship to grow, but I need you to meet me halfway.”

So, I (M19) have got these red spots and a bit of acne (which i had lot's of in my mid teenage) on my cheeks and on my forehead (mostly at the right side) and some visible pores that I really want to get rid of. I started skin care a year ago.
I’m also looking to detan my skin. My skin’s gotten darker or maybe just redder? Could be from all the handwalks I do to boost blood flow to my head 😝 (just kidding… kind of).

A little about me: I have oily skin and I’m usually outdoors doing workouts usually under a shade or at university and am about to begin my part-time corporate life too.
Note: In like last 6 months of 2024, I was mostly indoors and got highly untanned with just Cleansing, sometimes Vitamin C serum and Fuller's Earth so I'm aware of that but now I simply cannot stay indoors.

Right now I’m using five products:

1. Bio-Aqua Rice Raw Pulp Cleanser – just started using this as my night face wash a couple of weeks ago. It has glycerin, Lauric acid, some sulfates and then some random chemicals.
2. Fair & Lovely Men’s Face Wash – I use this or the Bio Aqua face wash when my skin’s extra oily and I need to remove sunblock at night. It also has similar ingredients to that of the above cleanser.
3. Jade’s Vitamin C & Papaya Extract Face Wash – I use this every morning for a refreshing start.
4. Retinol + Niacinamide + Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer – I apply this three times a week after shaving and my face feels super smooth (I’m still new to it).
5. 100 SPF Sunblock – I layer this over the moisturizer or I use it solo whenever I skip the moisturizer. Previously I was using Vince’s 40 SPF with zinc.

For nights, I’ve been using Jaysuing’s 5 in 1 Facial Serum (10% Hyaluronic acid, 5% Niacinamide, 30% Vitamin C, 10% Vitamin E and 5% Collagen) for about three weeks now and I apply that almost every night and it feels smooth too but I wake up with a very oily face in the morning.

I’ve also tried a homemade anti-tan pack (coffee, chickpea flour, honey, yogurt), but I noticed it leaves my skin a bit yellowish/orangish. I’ve got a Vitamin C cleanser and a turmeric + Vitamin C firming cream on deck but I haven’t tried those out yet.

So here’s my real question: based on all this, how can I improve my skincare routine and get rid of the tan? Any product swaps, extra steps or tips you’ve found life changing? Thanks in advance! 😊

**TL;DR** – Met an amazing girl who later disclosed she has quiet BPD.  
We dated \~3 months, hit a rough patch tied to a consent mis-cue and her exam stress.  
She pressed “pause,” but still shows interest. I’d like to offer a slower, safer pace.  
Looking for honest outside perspectives: is a reconnection feasible—or wishful?

# 1. Quick background

* **Me:** late-20s ♂, painter/illustrator, living in rural area at the moment.
* **Her:** mid-20s ♀, philosophy student in a big city, diagnosed as *quiet borderline*.
* **Relationship style:** we clicked fast—same humor, same creative brain-wiring. We spoke almost exclusively in English.

# 2. Timeline (bullet format so it’s readable)

* **Month 0 – 1:**
   * Started chatting while she was ending an open relationship.
   * Five in-person dates (each 3 days in a row) → chemistry off the charts, lots of future-talk from her too (summer trips, etc.).
* **Month 2:**
   * She says “I’m not ready for a *relationship* yet, but I don’t want to lose you.”
   * We agree to keep it light and see where it goes.
* **Month 3, the rupture:**
   * Sleepover after a party; I initiated intimacy, she said “no” a couple of times. I stopped, but I kept trying to cuddle and didn’t fully register her freeze response.
   * Next day she’s visibly shaken. I mis-read her mood, acted grumpy about leaving early (big mistake).
   * Four days later she phones me: says our feelings aren’t aligned, her exam stress is overwhelming, she needs space → *break*.
* **Since then (4 weeks):**
   * I apologised on a call; she thanked me for owning it.
   * She liked one of my IG posts after two weeks of silence.
   * Came to my art opening for 40 min with two friends; complimented my appearance, but kept distance.
   * Minimal DMs (I sent a national-holiday meme; she replied with humor but brief).

# 3. Current situation

* Her exam session ends **4 July**.
* I plan to text **6 July** proposing coffee and an honest debrief.
* My intention: **slower pace**, more consent check-ins, no pressure to label anything unless she wants.
* Meanwhile I’m working, posting art progress, and *not* bombarding her.

# 4. What I’m asking the subreddit

1. **Does this sound salvageable** if I respect her pace and boundaries, or am I ignoring red flags?
2. **Best way to phrase the 6 July invitation** so it feels safe and non-pushy?
3. For partners of quiet-BPD: **Is her “pull back, but still check socials & show up” pattern** typical pre-re-engagement behavior, or just polite detachment?

Any advice—especially from people who’ve reconciled after a boundary breach—would help me calibrate expectations.

1lkht8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lkht8z/aitah_for_kissing_my_sisters_boyfriend_8_years/,AITAH for Kissing My Sister’s Boyfriend 8 Years Ago (Now My Husband)?,"Throwaway, because my family knows my main account.

This is something I’ve been carrying for nearly a decade, and while I’ve come to terms with some of it, I still feel like maybe I was the villain. And maybe I still am. I just want honest opinions. Not sympathy, not pitchforks — just clarity.

So, for context, I (33M now, 25 at the time) kissed my sister’s boyfriend. I know how that sounds. And yeah — it was as bad as you’re imagining. My sister, “Anna,” (she's 2 years older) was dating this guy, “Jay,” and they’d been together for about six months when she brought him home for Thanksgiving. I hadn’t met him before then.

Jay was charming — not in a player kind of way, but in that easygoing, good-listener kind of way. He was funny without being loud, thoughtful without seeming fake. From the moment he came into the house, it was like he just *fit* into our family. And yeah, I noticed him. More than I should have.

Now, to be clear, I wasn’t “out” at the time. Not even to myself. I’d never had a boyfriend, barely even admitted to myself I liked men. But meeting Jay kind of cracked something open. I started catching myself watching him — laughing with him a little too long, going out of my way to be in the room when he was. I knew it was bad. I knew he was off-limits. But I felt like I was drowning in this new feeling I couldn’t control.

The kiss happened on the third night. We were both a little drunk — not blackout, but buzzed. Everyone else had gone to bed. We were in the kitchen cleaning up, talking about life, about relationships, and I said something dumb like, “Anna’s lucky.” He looked at me and said something I’ll never forget: “You’re pretty great too, you know.”

I leaned in. He didn’t stop me. It lasted maybe five seconds. But it changed everything.

The next morning, Jay told Anna what had happened. I didn’t ask him to, but I didn’t try to stop it either. I guess I thought confessing might somehow make it less awful. It didn’t. She lost it — understandably. Screamed, cried, called me a disgusting traitor. She dumped him on the spot, and then turned on me. Told me I wasn’t her brother anymore. That she wished I’d never been born.

We didn’t speak for over a year.

The fallout in the family was huge. My parents were furious, mostly disappointed. They didn’t kick me out, but they did say I needed to “give Anna space,” and “reflect on what kind of person I wanted to be.” Jay disappeared from all of our lives — or so I thought.

About 14 months later, I ran into him by total chance at a bookstore in another city. We ended up grabbing coffee — just to catch up. He apologized again. I did too. We both agreed that what happened that night was a mistake.

But something else happened. We talked for hours. It felt natural, easy, and kind of... safe. We started texting after that. Then calling. Then visiting. It wasn't instant — it took almost a year before we even admitted we were dating.

By the time I told my parents (2 years after the kiss), they were stunned but... not surprised. My dad said, “I figured something like this might happen eventually,” which I still don’t know how to take.

I told Anna six months later. I wrote her a letter. A long one. I apologized again, said I understood if she never wanted to talk to me, but I needed her to know the truth. That this wasn’t some short-term fling. That we were serious. She never responded.

That was six years ago.

Today, Jay and I are married. We had a small ceremony, didn’t invite most of the family. Just a few friends and his side. My parents came. My sister did not.

She still hasn’t spoken to me. She didn’t reply to the wedding invite. She sends birthday gifts to our parents but doesn’t visit if I’m around. I’ve tried reaching out again and again — cards, emails, even tried to meet her in person once when I knew she was in town. Nothing.

I get it. I hurt her. I crossed a huge boundary, and the fact that I ended up building a life with the person who hurt her too probably makes it worse. But at the same time… it’s been 8 years. And I don’t know what more I can do to fix it.

My parents say I need to ""respect her healing process,” but at some point, I feel like I’ve been permanently branded the villain in a story that got more complicated than anyone expected.

So I guess I’m asking: **AITAH** for kissing her boyfriend — yes, I know I was then — but am I *still* the asshole now, eight years later, for having built a life with him?",0,1750886163.0,AITAH,38,0.41,False

Even worse, the game low-key gaslights you about it - I tended to start login with gathering daily stuff, including lottery tickets, and then went to temple only for the game to tell me I already got A-Shuo's reward. Missed a few divinations that way thinking they must be weekly or something until I figured it out.

Seriously, no other single thing in game gave me that much ludonarrative dissonance (with possible exception of Tin Master denying you coffee). Like, I get why you might not be able to get more that one lottery ticket - New Eridu seems to be semi-authoritarian society, so maybe they register tickets to your phone number in some sort of centralized system and refuse to sell you more than one. 

But why would a Waifei best boy a day's worth of ride away from Sixth Street refuse to give you - a disciple of the Temple, no less - divination just because you bought a lottery ticket in a news kiosk, a fact he should neither know nor care about..? And the rewards aren't even worth that much - you get way more on every single event than you get in a month worth of drawing those tickets!

Anyway. let's all petition HoYo or leave feedback when the next questionnaire comes or something - so that we can have both have our divinations and our lucky draws every day!

But I wonder if my machine gets the right temperature. Unfortunately it doesn't say what temperatures are set. There is just the default temperature and 4 low and 4 high settings.

If it turns out I've tried everything with my current settings, I could set my inner bur to an even finer setting and work from there.

Main red flag: Changing time (twice!)

I think this was due to him wanting to meet for dinner instead of coffee, but if you can’t verbally communicate that then it’s a bit strange, no?

TD showed up wearing a tshirt to a nice restaurant. I was not too fancy, but business casual, at least.

TD didn’t bring a gift, nor did I ask him to, but a bouquet of flowers is standard, especially since this commitment requires quite a bit of $.

TD didn’t order any food, but had two beers. I even offered to share, but he claimed he wasn’t hungry. I don’t know about you, but I go to restaurants to eat, lol.

TD bragged about his cars, businesses, boats, and frequent travel, and became irate when I wasn’t drooling over his achievements. 

TD talked over me so many times, I lost count.

TD asked for my weight, despite me being ectomorph-type and significantly less than him. I said “that’s not a question to ask a lady,” which only infuriated him.

TD began fetishizing BW/Asian women, and claiming I must be mixed with them because they’re sooooo sexy lol. I wish I was making this up.

While TD was sharing how he “loves partying, do you love partying?” x 10, I blocked him. 

TD grew bored of me not being a surface level person, having goals, and being educated. He left me on the date. I packed up my food, went home, and went to sleep.

Green flag: He wished me good luck on my travels!

**TL;DR** – Met an amazing girl who later disclosed she has quiet BPD.  
We dated \~3 months, hit a rough patch tied to a consent mis-cue and her exam stress.  
She pressed “pause,” but still shows interest. I’d like to offer a slower, safer pace.  
Looking for honest outside perspectives: is a reconnection feasible—or wishful?

# 1. Quick background

* **Me:** late-20s ♂, painter/illustrator, living in rural area at the moment.
* **Her:** mid-20s ♀, philosophy student in a big city, diagnosed as *quiet borderline*.
* **Relationship style:** we clicked fast—same humor, same creative brain-wiring. We spoke almost exclusively in English.

# 2. Timeline (bullet format so it’s readable)

* **Month 0 – 1:**
   * Started chatting while she was ending an open relationship.
   * Five in-person dates (each 3 days in a row) → chemistry off the charts, lots of future-talk from her too (summer trips, etc.).
* **Month 2:**
   * She says “I’m not ready for a *relationship* yet, but I don’t want to lose you.”
   * We agree to keep it light and see where it goes.
* **Month 3, the rupture:**
   * Sleepover after a party; I initiated intimacy, she said “no” a couple of times. I stopped, but I kept trying to cuddle and didn’t fully register her freeze response.
   * Next day she’s visibly shaken. I mis-read her mood, acted grumpy about leaving early (big mistake).
   * Four days later she phones me: says our feelings aren’t aligned, her exam stress is overwhelming, she needs space → *break*.
* **Since then (4 weeks):**
   * I apologised on a call; she thanked me for owning it.
   * She liked one of my IG posts after two weeks of silence.
   * Came to my art opening for 40 min with two friends; complimented my appearance, but kept distance.
   * Minimal DMs (I sent a national-holiday meme; she replied with humor but brief).

# 3. Current situation

* Her exam session ends **4 July**.
* I plan to text **6 July** proposing coffee and an honest debrief.
* My intention: **slower pace**, more consent check-ins, no pressure to label anything unless she wants.
* Meanwhile I’m working, posting art progress, and *not* bombarding her.

# 4. What I’m asking the subreddit

1. **Does this sound salvageable** if I respect her pace and boundaries, or am I ignoring red flags?
2. **Best way to phrase the 6 July invitation** so it feels safe and non-pushy?
3. For partners of quiet-BPD: **Is her “pull back, but still check socials & show up” pattern** typical pre-re-engagement behavior, or just polite detachment?

Any advice—especially from people who’ve reconciled after a boundary breach—would help me calibrate expectations.

I am down about 21 pounds and initially started off well with meal-planning and prioritizing protein, etc. After transitioning to 5mg about a month ago, I’ve completely fallen out of this routine and have had pretty poor eating habits in the time since (I.e., only having coffee/minimal water intake for a majority of my day aside from dinner, not prioritizing protein, not willing myself to eat when I’m not hungry, etc.). Because of this my motivation to be intentional about this process has decreased and I’m finding the thought of meal-planning and finding foods that I can stomach to eat when I’m not hungry be intimidating.  I can only imagine the negative impact to my health that will come to continuing on in this way. I am seeking out any advice that might be helpful in getting me back on track, whether that be specific meal plans to follow, tips for motivation, etc.

**Disappointing and Uncomfortable Stay**

When we arrived at the tiny cabin, it was clear the photos posted online were outdated. That was fine — we expected rustic, and the structure has potential. It’s an old building that’s been turned into a cabin, and while it could be cute, it’s very clearly pieced together and in need of repairs. Like another reviewer noted, there are cracked tiles, missing wood planks under the carpet, and water stains on the walls. Cosmetic issues aside, the real problem was the cleanliness — or lack of it.

The cabin was **dirty**. I immediately sent photos to the owner, who did respond by sending the cleaner back out. However, the condition of the space made it clear that cleaning had been neglected for quite some time. The floors hadn’t been swept or mopped. All the appliances — inside and out — were dirty. The microwave had food splatter and a dead bug inside. The oven and fridge were also grimy, with old food, spills, and a general lack of attention. Every windowsill had dust and dead bugs that definitely didn’t accumulate since the last guest, especially given how quick the cleaner claimed the turnover was (which she used as an excuse for missing so much).

There was splattered food on the walls, a dirty bathroom mirror with backsplash residue, and thick dust covering all the wall decor. The welcome mat and kitchen rug were filthy and tattered — the kitchen rug was even flipped upside down. When I turned it over, I saw a huge yellow stain along with being dirty. The bathroom shower mat was also gross.

When the cleaner returned, she showed up with a grocery bag containing a 3-pack of Clorox wipes. She immediately apologized, saying it was her fault — she was overwhelmed and forgot to clean properly. While I was talking to her, a man who had driven her there got out of the car and started pacing close to the cabin. I was alone at the time (my husband and son were at the store), and it felt like he was trying to listen in on our conversation. It was unnerving. She said it was her son, but I honestly don’t know — he sat in the car afterward with the window down, which didn’t help me feel any more comfortable.

The whole situation was awkward. She kept asking what I wanted her to clean — which was frustrating because it was clear the place hadn’t been cleaned at all. She didn’t dust anything, the outside of the washer and dryer were still dirty with dried residue, and the bedroom carpet hadn’t been vacuumed in what looked like a long time. At that point, I honestly started to question whether the bedsheets had even been changed. She claimed they had — just like she claimed the rugs had been washed — but it was hard to believe.

She ended up wiping out the microwave, cleaning *one* fridge drawer (not the whole fridge), wiping the bathroom mirror, apologizing again, and taking the old kitchen and welcome mats with her. Then, she left the pack of Clorox wipes behind — in case I “wanted to clean up anything else.” That was it. The owner didn’t check in with us afterward, and I didn’t feel comfortable saying more at the time due to the unsettling interaction earlier. I waited until we checked out to share this full feedback.

As for the outdoor area — it’s also not maintained. The string lights around the fire pit area barely worked (only about six bulbs lit up). The outdoor chairs were dirty, there were wasp spray bottles lying around, and the back door — the first thing you see when you arrive — was in bad shape and badly needed paint.

This cabin *could* be charming. It’s small, so it wouldn’t take much to keep it clean, fix the basic cosmetic issues, and maintain the outdoor space. If it had simply been clean, I could have overlooked the rest. But instead, I had an uncomfortable and disappointing stay. The fact that the cleaner showed up with just a 3-pack of wipes, asked me what to clean, and left the wipes behind for me to use says it all.

The reviews on this listing are 98% great with 2 others giving a similar review as me. Im not sure how reviews work as far as what it kept and what can be deleted but I find it hard to believe. 

Am I wrong for finding all of this unacceptable? ",1,1750885109.0,AirBnBHosts,6,1.0,False

Then I had to see my primary who also did a EKG. She said my EKG was textbook worthy. 

I’ve seen a cardiologist and have completed a 48 holter monitor, echocardiogram and stress test & of course another EKG. 

Everything came back normal. 

I don’t drink coffee, I’ve never really drank energy drinks. I’ve cut out caffeinated sodas. I don’t take any medications.  I don’t drink alcohol that much. Occasionally of course but nothing crazy.  

Symptoms: 
Palpitations, chest pressure, above left boob pain where i feel the need to rub it. I originally would have left arm pain and left armpit pain but it hasn’t happened in a couple weeks now. 
My resting heart rate was always over 100. 
And then after like a month it went back to normal/good range. But now I’m just mainly dealing with the pain & fatigue. 
During the high BPM timeline my blood pressure was also in the red zones. 
Now my blood pressure is perfect. 
My heart hasn’t spiked up at all during a resting rate. 

It’s just pain now. I’ve been dealing with all of this since February. 

Yes I do have anxiety. 
That was the first thing I asked the cardiologist when he was saying I was healthy. 
He basically told me no. Then I asked what about stress. He said no. 
He said it could be sinus tachycardia. 
And that it could just come and go for no reason.

I don't really think that there is a good way to start my story, so I'm going to begin with the part that really caused this. I'm an adult in my twenties who, like many young adults, feels like my life doesn't have any purpose. Ever since I graduated high school, I have been roaming around North America, trying to find a place to call home-to find people to call home.
  My family is great, if a bit strange, but they weren't the type of family I wanted to have for my own. I wanted to find like-minded friends and maybe even someone to fall in love with, to make our own little family. I moved from state to state, hoping that the next place would have what I was looking for, but I was never so lucky.



Part one: I need a break


I had just moved into my new apartment in Cedar Hollow, Maine-a place so obscure I wasn’t even sure I’d heard of it before. But I needed somewhere to stay, and this cheap Craigslist find would have to do. It wasn’t the worst place I’d lived, but it was far from anything to brag about.

  Nearby, I landed a job at a small company called “Cryp-tee-d Co.”, which made quirky T-shirts featuring cryptids-those mysterious creatures from folklore. The shirts were amusing but hardly destined for big sales outside Maine. Little did I know, this job would mark the start of the darkest chapter of my life.

  At first, everything seemed normal. The company had a handful of long-time employees, and there was a steady flow of people coming and going. Over the first year, I met someone special, and by the end of that year, we decided to start dating.

  We had fun going on little dates, trying out odd restaurants, and venting about the ridiculous shirts we made-shirts no one ever seemed to wear. We dreamed of escaping the job, especially since our boss was a verbally abusive nightmare, constantly yelling about how we failed to capture the ""essence"" of cryptids in our designs.

  Both severely underpaid, we decided to move in together to split rent. That’s when things started to unravel.

  Spending every moment together should have been a blessing, but my old habits of self-sabotage crept in. Growing up in a strange family, I struggled with genuine affection. I thought gifts were the way to show love, but I forgot to be emotionally present. My girlfriend often told me this, but instead of opening up, I shut down and isolated her.

  Over two years, things worsened until she packed up and left. I never knew where she went. Attempts to reach her failed-she likely blocked me. I sank into a pit of despair that bled into my work, and the quality of my shirts plummeted.

  My boss’s anger grew with every recycled or worse design I submitted. Depression took hold. My last friend from high school grew distant, caught up in his own life. I started calling out of work, using family emergencies as excuses to take time off, but I never visited them. I feared their judgment and rejection.

  I stayed home, draining my savings, playing video games on my oblivious neighbor’s open Wi-Fi. My apartment was cold and lonely, even with the heat on. I never slept in the bedroom anymore-I wanted my things to still smell like her. Instead, I crashed on the awful couch she hated but I had insisted on keeping. It was a cruel joke how right she’d been about its discomfort.

  Things got so bleak I began searching for an escape-whether through drugs or something darker. One night, before sleep, I prayed to any god that might listen. I just needed a break.


Part 2: Learning to dream

  I started spending more and more time online, searching for ways to help myself. I tried everything-from psychedelic drugs to one of those online therapy apps. Honestly, those apps almost did more harm than good. The people never seemed all that professional, and after a few sessions, I felt even worse. One night, after another disappointing therapy call, I lay in bed feeling like I’d nearly run out of options. That’s when a memory from my school days floated up: lucid dreaming. If you don’t know what that is, it’s when you become aware in your dream and can control everything about it. You could be a knight in a castle, a hero fighting Godzilla, or even create your own Garden of Eden. I made a mental note to call out of work the next day and dedicate myself to learning about lucid dreaming. As I drifted off to sleep, the last thing I remember was the faint sound of sorrowful laughter, then darkness.

  I was never one to sleep long, so a few hours later I woke up and decided to get coffee to jumpstart my research. I never really believed coffee made me more productive, but with enough sugar, at least I’d be wired enough to keep searching for answers. On my way home, I called my boss to say I was feeling sick and would be bedridden all day. As fate would have it, I was standing at a red light when my boss pulled up right beside me. We made eye contact-me on the phone, him in his car. He rolled down his window and yelled through both the phone and the open window that I’d better see him in his office as soon as I got to work, or I’d be fired. Frustrated with my own stupidity, I spiked my half-finished coffee onto the sidewalk, rushed home, changed into my work clothes, and headed in.

  When I got to my boss’s office, I knocked on the door. No answer. I waited, knocked again, still nothing. Slowly, I pushed the door open. He was sitting with his back to me, staring out the window. My heart sank-this was exactly how movies showed someone right before they were found dead. Was I about to be framed? Would I go to jail for something I didn’t do? Was today the end of my free life?

  I skirted around the edge of the room, careful not to touch anything. I didn’t want to leave any evidence behind. When I finally saw his face, I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding. He wasn’t dead. But he wasn’t right, either. He sat there, unblinking, tears rolling down his cheeks, a huge smile plastered on his face. A strange, ominous laugh leaked out of him. As soon as I moved into his peripheral vision, he snapped back to his usual angry self. He barked at me for not knocking, told me to sit down, and when I just stood there, stunned, he grew red in the face and demanded I sit immediately. I backed around his desk and sat, never taking my eyes off him, wondering if I’d imagined the whole thing.

  The conversation went about as well as I’d expected. He told me I was on my final strike. My shirt designs were slipping in quality, I’d been calling out too often, and I’d lied to him that very morning. If I didn’t shape up, I’d be out of a job. The whole time he yelled, tears kept streaming down his face, as if he didn’t even notice. I thought to myself that this might be the most uncomfortable situation I’d ever experienced.

  After that strange encounter, I went back to work and actually managed to come up with a few decent shirt ideas. The weirdness of the morning seemed to spark my creativity. When the day was over, I hurried home, eager to put the whole ordeal behind me. I didn’t have to work the next day, so I could stay up as late as I wanted researching lucid dreaming. Everything I read said I needed to get into a meditative state before dreaming. That was going to be tough, but I was determined. I sat on my uncomfortable couch, put on relaxing music, closed my eyes, and tried to meditate. I had no idea what I was doing, and before long, I just fell asleep without any results.

  Over the next week, I scoured YouTube for meditation guides and found a ton of options. But I didn’t pay for ad-free content, so every time I started to relax, a loud ad would jolt me out of it. I realized I’d need to make more money if I wanted to meditate without interruptions. So, I started showing up to work more often, and my boss seemed to ease up on me.

  After that day in my boss’s office, nothing weird happened between us, and I didn’t notice anything strange with anyone else. Gradually, I forgot about it. By the end of the month, I’d upgraded my streaming services so I could meditate without ads. I kept practicing, and little by little, my sleep improved.

  A week into my new routine, my dreams started to return. At first, they were just scattered fragments-disjointed ideas and themes-but it was better than nothing. I couldn’t remember them clearly, but just knowing I’d dreamed at all felt like progress. My life began to take a turn for the better. It’s amazing what a full eight hours of sleep can do, even if the motivation is just to avoid getting fired.

  A month in, I noticed the first signs of being able to control my dreams. I could make things happen on purpose and remember them when I woke up. It felt like directing a movie, though I was a pretty bad director. I could fly around the world, but since I’d never left the United States, my world was basically just a giant globe. I jumped off the Empire State Building and landed unharmed, like in that scene from The Matrix. I knew that with more practice, I could become a true lucid dreamer.

  The first time I had a dream where I was fully in control was incredible. I created a world of endless meadows and wildflowers, the sun shining bright and warm. I wandered through fields, feeling the grass brush against my legs, smelling the flowers. I set up a picnic and ate my favorite foods, which tasted better than anything I’d had in years. It was as if someone had turned up the color saturation in my life. For the first time in a long time, I felt okay. After eating, I wandered further, until I reached the edge of a dense, mysterious forest. It was thick but somehow inviting. I heard a stream trickling just beyond the trees. I tried to will the forest away, to return to the meadows, but nothing changed. Just as I gathered the courage to step into the forest, my alarm went off, pulling me back to reality. I decided that if I ever found myself at the edge of that forest again, I wouldn’t hesitate-I’d step in and explore the unknown corners of my dream.



Part 3:Hopeless Romantic 

  Something about the edge of that forest must have really messed with my subconscious, because after that dream, I couldn’t control my dreamscapes the way I had before. It was as if the border of that imagined woodland had erected a barrier in my mind, keeping me from returning to that place of wonder and possibility. Frustrated, I decided it was time to take a break from chasing dreams and focus on real life for a while.

  I figured some fresh air might do me good, so I actually applied for vacation time-legitimately, for once-and got it approved. I packed a bag, got in my car, and drove west for a couple of hours until I reached a quaint little town nestled beside a sparkling lake. The place felt like a secret, a pocket of peace tucked away from the world, and I decided I’d spend at least one night there.

  Wandering the town’s winding streets, I stumbled upon a shop that stood out from its sleepy surroundings: “Conspira-See,” the sign read, adorned with a psychedelic eye. The place looked so out of place, I couldn’t resist stepping inside. Given my own line of work, I was curious to see if the people here were as odd as the ones back home.

  Inside, the store was a treasure trove of the bizarre and the old-books that looked a century past, shelves crowded with objects I couldn’t even begin to name. There were cryptid references everywhere, familiar and strange all at once. But the oddest thing by far was the complete absence of a shopkeeper. I waited at the counter, called out, and heard nothing but the creak of old wood. Suddenly, a shuffling noise behind me made my skin prickle. I spun around, heart pounding.

  Standing just two paces away was what I thought was a statue of Mothman, looming over five feet tall. But then it moved-a young woman, dressed in a full Mothman costume, grinning at me with the satisfaction of a prank well played. She slipped out of the costume, laughter bubbling up as she saw how thoroughly she’d startled me.

  She was strikingly beautiful, with dark hair cascading down her back and eyes that sparkled with mischief. Her skin glowed with a warm, sun-kissed hue, and her smile-crooked, goofy, utterly endearing-caught me completely off guard. She moved with a charming clumsiness, and her voice, soft and lilting with an Irish accent, made me feel instantly at ease. Her name was Helena, and in that moment, I felt a strange, immediate connection.

  We chatted for a while, and she managed to convince me to buy a couple of odd trinkets. When I asked for her number, she laughed-a laugh that sounded oddly familiar, joyful but somehow forced at first, before settling into something more genuine. I brushed it off as my imagination, chalking it up to not having heard real laughter in too long.

  I left town the next day with a lighter heart and Helena’s number saved in my phone. We started texting, and I was surprised by how easy it was to talk to her. She told me about her love for painting and comics, and her enthusiasm made me realize I needed a hobby of my own-something more than just video games and meditation. I wanted to be a part of the world again, if only to have more to share with her.

  When she asked what I did for fun, I awkwardly tried to explain lucid dreaming. To my relief, she already knew all about it-more than I did, actually, which made sense given her job in that shop of curiosities.

  One evening, she suggested we talk on the phone. The thought gave me butterflies, and I dialed her number right away. As the phone rang, something strange happened: a raspy, ancient voice seemed to answer, whispering the word, “Holi’andr.” The name made me smile involuntarily, filling me with a sudden, inexplicable joy so intense that a tear rolled down my cheek. Then, just as quickly, the sensation faded, and Helena answered, her voice grounding me in reality. Relief and disappointment mingled inside me-I was happy, but a little wistful that I couldn’t always feel that euphoric.

  We talked late into the night, until I drifted off to sleep with the phone still pressed to my ear. It was the first time I’d slept in my own bed since my ex had left, and it felt like a turning point-a step forward into something new.

  The next morning, I woke up energized. At work, my creativity soared-I designed shirts better than I ever had, good enough that my boss actually complimented me for the first time. It was so out of character that I texted Helena about it right away. She replied with a joke about spreading positivity, and I couldn’t help but smile.

  That afternoon, I went on a cleaning spree at home, clearing out old junk and making space for something better. I scheduled an appointment to finally get my own internet connection, and even went grocery shopping instead of ordering in. Sitting in my freshly cleaned house, I realized how much lighter everything felt-the oppressive shadow of my past was finally gone.

  That night, I played some games and then settled in for meditation. For the second time ever, I slipped into a dream where I had full control. I couldn’t help but wonder if it was Helena’s presence in my life that made the difference. Maybe, just maybe, I was starting to dream again-both asleep and awake.


If you read this far, thank you so much. This is the first story that I'm ever working on so it's fairly rougher in the edges but I was going for a spin on cosmic horror: cosmic bliss. I felt like I haven't seen too much of it so I tried to write the story that I would like to read.

But it feels like the week just began—on Sunday, not long ago.  
Now suddenly, it’s already over.  
Tomorrow’s a day off—1st of the Hijri year.  
The “week” slipped away while I was still figuring out how it started.  

Isn’t it terrifying?  
How time slips between your fingers  
without even the courtesy of a sound?  
No crash, no signal—just *gone.*  

One minute you’re sipping coffee.  
Next thing you know,  
you’re looking back at an entire week  
you barely remember living.  

It hit me hard tonight.  
The things we do now—these tiny, repeated motions—  
will be our *past* soon.  
Days become months.  
Routines become identity.  

And that raises the question:  
**Is routine something to be cherished… or something we should fight against?**  
Is comfort a form of peace,  
or is it a slow kind of erasure?  

Because what *is* peace, really?  
Is it waking up each day to the same rhythm,  
content in the quiet repetition—even if you're alone?  
Or does peace exist only beyond the boundary of our comfort zone,  
out where things are uncertain and raw and real?  

I’ve always watched the world closely.  
People move fast.  
They chase things—money, love, validation—  
always something they don’t have yet.  

And I can’t help but wonder...  
*If everyone’s chasing something, does peace even exist?*  
Or is it just a mirage,  
a shape that always stays one step ahead?  

And if it does exist,  
why does cruelty feel louder than kindness?  
Why is it so easy to ignore the soft, good things in life,  
and let the darker ones shape us?  

Do people ever stop to listen to themselves?  
To notice how they speak,  
how they look at others,  
how they leave an imprint behind, even in silence?  

It’s strange.  
We live on autopilot,  
but every passing moment becomes the story of who we were.  

And in the quiet moments,  
I wonder what kind of story we’re really writing.  
What page this world is on.  

Because some people are just trying to survive.  
Some are buried under rubble while others refresh a feed.  
And yet somehow—  
faith still flickers in the smoke.  

Not all peace is worldly.  
Not all justice is delayed.  
And not all silence is weakness.",8,1750884746.0,jordan,0,1.0,False

1lkh32a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMXFs/comments/1lkh32a/30_m4f_seeking_a_partner_for_marriage_to_build_a/,30 [M4F] - Seeking a partner for marriage to build a life together,"Hi, I am a tall, black-haired, naturally tanned, and clean-shaven man with boundless energy and a unique way of managing frustration by intensely scribbling. My past has shaped me into a resilient, adaptable, and deeply caring individual who values honesty, loyalty, and integrity above all else. I much prefer verbal communication to truly connect, and I'm seeking a genuine, non-abusive partner to build a life with, share memories, and finally feel at home. My love language is expressed through quality time, acts of service, physical touch, and words of affirmation. If you're not recovering from a breakup or divorce and are ready for a real connection, I'd love to get to know you.


ABOUT ME

Hair colour: Black

Skin colour: naturally tanned skin

Height: 172cm

Always clean shaven

No tattoos or piercings

Anger: If I get angry, I suffer with a headache. So, I don't. I instead become frustrated and go for a walk or look at the sky.

When I used to get angry in the past, I would feel a sharp pain like someone was stabbing my head with thick needles. The pain would last for an hour or three. During this time I have broken down crying due to the pain.

A few months ago, I found an effective method that helps me relieve frustration which  is to take a paper and frantically scribble releasing all my frustration onto the paper, where I feel alot better in minutes.  

So, if you ever see me bent over the kitchen counter all tensed up scribbling, you will know that I either had a horrible day or I relieved very bad news and my I am in a state of shock where I am trying to make sense of the situation.

Energy: I have been hyperactive since I was a kid and have this ridiculous amount of energy where everyday I struggle to feel tired. I drink warm milk in the morning or stay up till 3AM just to be able to sit and work without feeling the urge to get up and run.

This is why, I want a wife who will let me do all the house chores, while she relaxes. So that I will feel a bit tired and be able to sleep peacefully.


Weight: varies between 70kg (150lb) to 75kg (165lb) depending on how much I eat and active I am. 

Smoking/Vaping Habits: None, I never have and never will.

Alcohol: Very rarely as in once in a few months and I have never gotten drunk and kept it under control.

Finances: I am very good at managing my finances where I manually keep track of my expenses and I enjoy using cash wherever it is accepted. 

Work out and eat healthy. 

Child-free life: 

I think I should NEVER have kids because I see parents pampering their kids and become overly worried when a child a child has a small scratch. I don't think I could ever be so soft as parent because I learned how to deal with life differently.

When I was a kid, I was given a German Army Pocket Knife (still have it to this day), basic compass, eight millimeter nylon rope and I had a whistle to send a SOS signal in morse code, all of which I learned from reading books.

I would spend my weekends in the mountains alone, eating blueberries and building a shelter during the heavy rains.

When I fell and hurt myself, I washed the wounds with water from a stream and tied a handkerchief around the wound until I came back home and administered first aid.

This self-learning, yet, fun process thought me how to adapt, navigate in different climates and environments turning forest and jungles into a playground with no restrictions and no adult supervision.

Text vs verbal communication: I am much better at verbal communication and I strongly feel its better to get to know each other over a call as its easy to express oneself emotionally. 


Why AM I STILL SINGLE?

Throughout my life, I have been someone who is lonely from the age of five in school as I was canned by the teachers because I didn't know how to speak a local language that is not spoken anywhere else in the world. I was also tortured by other students to the point where I ended up in coma after my head was dashed against the rocks. As a teenager, I was a this guy who didn't know how to properly communicate with other people due to the lack of social skills and it has taken me years to learn how to socialize. Somehow, I have learned to communicate in a professional environment well, but still struggle sometimes in a social environment where I overthink about what to say.

This is also why I have been single all my life until I was 29, when for the first time I felt what it was like to be in love and feel a sense of peace and happiness I have never felt or experienced before in my life. This relationship with the Chilean women ended in May 2024 as the person I met was a not who she was claimed to be and it's a long weird story that leaves most people feeling surprised and is better told over a call than written out in text. 

I have completely recovered from the painful breakup and now know myself alot better than I used to.

Limerence also made it difficult for me which caused me to mess in the getting to know stage with anyone  but now I have overcome to a great extent.

WHY DO I WANT TO GET MARRIED? 

To know that I mean something to one person in this world. 

To feel a sense of peace and not feel so lonely. Don't get me wrong. I have friends, but friends slowly dissappear with time the moment I move to another country, its how my life has always been.

To have someone to share memories together and walk together on this journey called life. 

To build a life together where we work as a team.

Although, my dynamic life is nice where I visit new places all the time and every week is a new experience, its also a life where I feel lonely and even if I make friends, I know that I will have to say goodbye.

I want to settle down somewhere in this world and build a life together instead of living a minimalistic life due to airline weight restrictions.

I have my own house back in my home country (I work abroad), but to me its just a house. Not a place I consider home.

DO NOT;

DO NOT Contact me if your recovering from a break up or divorce because you will use me to heal from your pain and once I help you recover, you will feel a l strong sense of independence and think ""I don't a man in my life and need time to focus on myself"" and just discard me like trash, leaving me with dissapointment and where I start wandering how to trust someone. It helps you, but hurts me more.

So far this has happened with a German, French, Russian and the last was the Egyptian. All four were recovering from a painful break up.

Please do not use me just to pass the time because you are bored. 

I have already been through hell in my life since I was five years all the way to adulthood where I have been tortured and suffered with back and knee pains for years until I recovered. I have also nearly drowned as I was held underwater and I have been in coma after my head was dashed against the rocks and I lost alot of blood. What has kept me alive is a calculation; my current age minus averge human life expectancy of 80 years equals the question ""what do I with the rest of my life?"". 

By constantly asking myself this question, I have been living a dynamic life where I work in one country then get a job in another country and work their before moving on to the next country. In each country I have had a different career as I love the challenge and the new experience.

I am NOT writing about what I went through to gain sympathy, but to discourage people who act kind and sweet, yet, take advantage of someone like me who is kind from my heart, can love a partner unconditionally and will care deeply when he falls in love with someone.


WHAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT IN A PARTNER - BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE OF DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER

1. How you treat other people: it does not matter how kind you are or if you go out of your way to help people or care about animals. What matters is who you are deep down in your heart and how you treat me.

Based on experience people who are sweet, kind, volunteered at animal shelters and seem to be amazing people are the ones who have hurt me the most, however, people who seem to be cold hearted and don't show empathy are the ones who turned out to the most reliable, caring people I know and whne they did show empathy it was real and came from their heart.

So, the only way to judge someone is when their is a disagreement or an area of conflict. Is the other person willing to talk things out and find a solution or is that person going to just leave the moment, their is a disagreement?

2. Religion: I will respect what you believe in and I will be more than happy to go to a place of worship if you want me to tag along, but don't force your religion on me. Thats all I ask.

3. Your Past: Your past is your past and it doesn't matter what bad decisions you made, what matters is who you are now and who you will be in the future. 

So, when we are getting to know each, you don't have to hide any anything or worry about being judged, because I don't. 

If your upfront and honest with me, I can be honest about myself. 

4. Your hobbies and interest. I have a wide range of hobbies and interest and I am also a very open minded person who enjoys new experiences.

5. Cooking: Since, I can cook, it does not matter if you don't know how to cook. 

6. Expressing yourself: If your someone who has trouble showing empathy or your the type of person who finds it difficult to show that you care, that is okay. Sometimes due to the pain and what you have been through. It can be difficult to find the right words or facial expressions to show that you care. 

Also, if you have suffered alot more than I have, it can be hard see my pain when its nothing compared to when you have been through.

Don't overthink, just openly tell me that you don't know how to reply. Tell me you don't feel empathy in your heart. I will understand you.

7. Height: Taller than me or shorter than me? I don't care.

8. Tattoos or birth marks

9. Piercings

10. Alcohol: get drunk if you want to, but if you start acting crazy I will just take you home.

11. Hair color or balding: Their are plenty of wigs on the market.

12. Music preferences

13. Movie preferences 

14. Education 

15. Amputation: If you have lost a hand or leg due to an accident, its fine by me.

16. Smoking habits: I don't mind if you do but I  will be concerned about your health and if you need help trying to quite, I will be their for you in every step of the way.


MY IDEAL PARTNER 

Someone who values honesty, loyalty and integrity. 

Someone who is not abusive (my ex was very sweet and kind on the outside but was very abusive verbally, very selfish and very short tempered). It's an experience, I don't want to go through again.

Maximum weight of 90kg (approximately 200lb)

Eight years ago I weighed 85kg (187.39 lb) and in three months I brought it down to 70kg (154.32 lb)

My three month method to weight loss was:

1. I stopped eating all the junk food and donuts and ecl and only ate vegetables and meat.

2. I ran everyday in the evening as fast as I could for just 20 to 30 minutes. 

3. Walked at a speed of 12 km/h (7.45 mi/h)


LOVE LANGUAGE 

Love Language: The way I express love towards a partner is through;

- Quality time where I give my partner her undivided attention, making memories together, shared activities and doing things together.

Acts of service: I believe that actions speak lounder than words and I have always dreamed of being the one who;
- does all the house chores so that you can relax
- cooking for you
- running an errand
- being helpful in anyway I can
- hold an umbrella over your head
- carry your bag
- serve you tea, juice coffee or anything you ask

Physical touch: Never experienced this. 
- Hug: Never been hugged by a partner 
- Kiss: I have kissed one person I love once loved on the cheek once.
- Holding hands: never held hands, but want to one day.
- Cuddling: Never experienced it, but I guess it must be nice.

Words of Affirmation: expressing affection through spoken or written words, such as compliments, encouragement, and expressions of love (""I love you"").


If you want to get to know each other better send me a message where we can schedule a call at time that is convenient for both of us.

((Author Notes: Couple of things before you dig in.

First off, this was originally being written to be posted on NoSleep, but after seeing a lot of people posting their own stories here and the positive feed back from Isaiah and Hunter about how they enjoy seeing the short stories being post, i figure I would toss this one in for fun. Kind of glad there's other places to post beyond NoSleep.

Secondly, if you never heard a Newfy speak before, I am so sorry.   
  
Trying to write a Newfoundland styled folklore story was interesting but even as a Newfy myself it is kind of hard to write how we speak sometimes, especially the older folks.

Beyond that, thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy the story!))

  


First ‘twas whales, them hunted down, 

Their bones flung deep outside the town.



 We filled it up with tide born dead, 

Till live ones walked in there instead.



Whale bones rattle under tide, 

They dance when no one’s left behind.



Don’t start the tune. Don’t dig. Behave. 

You can’t unhear *The Drover’s Grave*.



My grandmother used to tell me that poem whenever I was misbehaving, fooling around too much or just being a little too loud when I was a kid. She would shout in a way that scared me no matter where I was in the house. I could be upstairs in my bedroom and I would hear her cane hit the floor with a thump before hearing her old shaky voice yell it out at me and every time she would follow up with, ‘Keep up wit what you’re doin’ and you’ll end up in Drover Grave Chris!”

When you're a kid you don’t really think about the words to stuff like that, you just hear the tone its spoken in and it puts a deep fear in you like nothing else in the world could when you're that young. As time went on those words carved their way into my mind, remembering the words to that short little poem each time it was spoken even long after she had stopped speaking them to me once I was old enough to behave.

What was Drover’s Grave? 

I was a teenager when I finally asked my grandmother where the poem came from and what it was about. “Me nan used t’tell me that one when I was just a young one.” I remember her telling me, not an ounce of happiness from her voice as she sat there telling me what she knew. “Some things best left be, Chris. Let a poem be just a poem, b’y.”

She wouldn’t tell me another word about it after that no matter how many times I asked her. I don’t know if it was her trying to protect me back then or if she truly didn’t know anything else beyond what she told me. Either way she took whatever else she knew with her to the grave later that same year, leaving a hole in the family but also a hole in any information I could gain from her. 

God I miss her and now I understand why she never said anything else. It was a mistake trying to find out more after all these years and she was right, some things were best left be.

Most folklore from Newfoundland was made for two things. To keep children from misbehaving or give drunken folk something to blame when they stumble back home or tucked away in the shed late at night. Mermaids, ghosts, Newfoundland fairies, didn’t matter what it was; they all tended to lean into one or the other back then. 

But Drover’s Grave, that one just felt different from all of the other ones I’ve heard before. There was something there and yet I couldn’t figure it out. 

The more I looked the less I found. It was like my grandmother was the only person to remain to know about this place yet she passed this mystery down to me before she passed away. It used to drive me crazy thinking about it back then, what it was about, where it came from, what was Drover’s Grave?

I was at a dead end, there was nothing else to work off of then the very words my grandmother left for me and for a long time it remained like that until a few weeks ago. 

My father is the kind of person who would keep everything we were given and tuck it neatly away in some forgotten corner of the house or shed until the time came to clean it out, like a magpie tucking shiny things away before forgetting about it moments later. He had done this to my grandmother's stuff for years, all of it tucked away in small brown boxes until disaster struck one day with water seeping into the basement. 

We had no clue where the leak was coming from and the job fell on to my shoulders to clear out the small room, my father would eventually dig around in the walls like an axe wielding psycho looking for the last survivor to find the leak and fix it. How cleaning the room was thrown into my lap I will never know, yet it was what I needed to discover more about Drover’s Grave. 

A lot of the stuff my father held on to from my grandmother was junk. Random things he had a hard time getting rid of even if it was simple stuff like mugs, blankets and other items all stuffed into these boxes, but one object stood out from the others. It was a small book-like object tightly wrapped in a black like garbage bag. In a way it looked similar to how the Necronomicon was all wrapped up in the Evil Dead Remake, minus the barbwire’s anyway, but it was for a good reason. 

Inside there was a bible, an old bible. So old that the pages were leaking out of its bindings, the bag being the only thing keeping it together at the time as I very gently pulled it free. I couldn’t tell you just how old this bible was, its pages were stained a golden brown, the cover was barely hanging on for its life and whatever thin metal used to be on the corners of this book were either long gone or simply resting at the bottom of the bag. 

Out of everything this was probably one of those items my father would want to hold on to even with its current condition. I was ready to wrap it up again when one of the pages caught my eye, the corner of it sticking out just a little more than the rest when I noticed it had some sort of writing on it. 

It wasn’t a page at all from the bible, instead it was a single sheet of paper folded up and on that little piece of paper was the poem my grandmother would tell me, but there was more.

Their bones flung deep outside the town.

Never forget —--------- and the ones Drover’s Grave took.



Obviously I’m not going to give you the name of the place that was written there, especially now. It’s better to keep that secret to myself until the bitter end and maybe, just maybe protect you from seeking it out yourself. 

I hope so anyway.

I couldn’t believe my eyes when I found that sheet of paper tucked away inside that crumbling bible. It must have belonged to my great great grandmother and yet it was the first real thread of information I could work with to figuring out this mystery my grandmother planted inside my mind. I took that little sheet of paper with me and left the bible at my fathers place, reading it over and over again with the village name burned into my mind as I got to work trying to find something, anything that could guide me to solving this mystery. I must have spent nearly three days digging around online, looking up local information, online boards and more. The hunt for Drover’s Grave was stuck in my mind and yet even with this small bit of information I was still having a hard time finding anything. 

Then it hit me.  
  


First ‘twas whales, them hunted down, 

Their bones flung deep outside the town.



Whale hunting.

They would have never mentioned that little bit of information if the village wasn’t involved in whale hunting, dragging them on to shore, butchering them and leaving their bones to bleach in the sun and salt. Whaling was very common in Newfoundland for centuries and even when the practice of it started to decline over time, it never really stopped until the early 1970’s. That little bit of history mixed with the idea of this village being a long forgotten or abandoned place was enough for me to narrow down my search. 

I started scooping up whatever lists of old abandoned whaling villages in Newfoundland that I could find, scraping through every name that popped up in front of me until finally I found it, I actually found it! 

A single name, faded away from time yet the moment my finger tapped on the name and the tiny map showing its location it came to life to me, giving me purpose to seek more once again as I star

Sorry, I forgot what I was going to say there. I can barely hear my own thoughts let alone try and write all of this down for you and it's only getting worse and worse.   
  
Anyway I found it and I was going to make it my goal to find it and see just what Drover’s Grave was once and for all.   
  
I took my time getting ready. Planning out possible routes and area’s I could possibly drive too, packing what I thought I would need, checking out old maps to see if I could get a proper location of the area and eventually turning to Google Maps to see the place.

Google Maps was interesting, I had a clear view of the area itself but it didn't look right. I could spot what looked like old houses but the image of the area was too blurry to really see anything, plus I didn't see any sort of gaping hole Drover's Grave was supposed to be. Either time had eventually filled it up or it was trying to hide itself somehow. In the end I decided to work with an old map once I was ready to head out, having a solid map in hand would probably help more than a digital one in the middle of nowhere.

I was so close to finding this Drover's Grave my grandmother scared me with for so many years now, yet it was the pit of my gut I should have listened to, telling me at the time that this was a bad idea, to stop where I was and leave things be.

Driving there I kept asking myself what I was actually going to find, what was I even expecting to see? The best answer was just a great big hole by the shore line, probably filled in by now with dirt and rocks. Maybe there wasn’t anything there at all and this was just another one of those old folk tales to keep children in place? If Drover Grave was real time had most likely wiped it off the map by now. 

It took the better part of the day just to get close to the area. I spent the night in an old run down motel, which I will never return to again, that seemed to have its best days behind them. When morning came around I was back on the road again with shitty coffee in hand. I was so close to the sight that I was getting excited.

It must have been an hour or two when I finally turned off the main road and started to drive down an old rough path that was tucked into the tree’s pretty well. It was not a fun ride down that path, the road was like a snake trail, turning left and right and left and right over and over again. To my surprise the road ended near an old cabin that had definitely seen better days with the front wall nearly bashed inwards, the door was nothing but splinters behind yellow RCMP tape. What ever happened here I did not want to know as I parked my car close but not too close, something bad happened here and the last thing I needed was to have my tires ripped apart by the broken glass and metal flung everywhere in front of this cabin. 

The place felt off is all.   
  
Once my car was parked I grabbed my gear, slipped my backpack on and checked the direction I needed to go before pushing my way into the forest. Walking through the woods was brutal and you have to understand, Newfoundland tree’s can be rough to get through. Sometimes they're just normal tree’s, enough space to walk through without a worry. But these trees? These trees were clumped together, almost like trying to push through a wall at times with how clustered a lot of them were thanks to the never ending wind some places had. Tree’s here were so tight together they killed each other off, the dead being held up by the lively ones like it was their duty to keep standing against the wind, branches so strong they could cut through your clothing if you pushed hard enough.   
  
Two hours of this type of forest was rough, forcing me to check my compass over and over again just to make sure I was actually going the right way. Took me nearly an hour just to break the tree line and enter a long grassy field where I finally saw it.   
  
Standing out in the distance where the sounds of water echoed towards me was a single standing wall belonging to a house that once stood tall. I had found the village that held Drover’s Grave.

Like most settlements scattered across Newfoundland, nature had reclaimed most of it back but what did remain still stood tall even if it was just a wall or two. Most of the houses and smaller buildings on the outer rim of the village were like that anyway, the further in you got the more you found that still had some of its roof still intact, some even still had windows to my surprise after all these years. Every house was just a slight variant to each other, a large box like house. Some had just one floor but others had two floors. What was more surprising was the fact that some of them still had their original paint on them, faded by now but some of them still showed off the bright yellow, red, blue paint they used, a tradition people now still did to paint their homes in smaller towns of course.   
  
From my understanding it was a way to help sailors find their way back home somehow, not sure how seeing a random bright colored house would help you but more to them I guess. The years of wind and salt had shipped away at the color of them, making them more faded at this point.

The further I made my way the more dense the houses and buildings became, small and large in size and a lot of them now still standing like nothing had happened. Some of the buildings had collapsed in on themselves, leaving nothing but the wooden bones to remain in its place like a rotting corpse in the open for so many years. It was like everyone had gotten up and left them, leaving everything behind inside of them. The amount of rusted hooks, shambled fishing nets and other equipment left behind, no one cared to come back for any of it, my gut trying to tell me to turn back again as I pushed on.

Down by the shore line the village touched the sea, a series of old wooden docks built to withstand storms and boats alike still stood strong and tall. Smaller wooden shacks were perched on old wooden stilts, stilts driven into the stone floor below them to hold them high enough above the waves no matter how bad it got. A good lot of them were still standing, some of them had been washed away by the waves over time, only the boney wooden legs sticking up from where it once stood as a reminder. 

The docks sticking out into the salted water were like broken fingers at this point, the waves had bashed them for so long it displaced them here and there, breaking off parts of them as well and swallowing them up into the salted sea. I could only imagine the kinds of boats and people who would work on these kinds of docks back then, fisherman dragging their catch just to gut them and lay them in the sun with salt further inland where the docks tipped on an angle to point them into the sun. 

A lot of this place was still intact as if waiting for someone to return and use them once again. The thing that caught my eye the most though was high above the town's shore line and up onto the cliffside overlooking the shoreline itself. At first glance I thought it was just another house, larger than the others and painted white, but the closer I got the quicker I realized it used to be a church. 

Unlike the rest of the village the church was built differently, taller and more deliberate. Its narrow windows and steep gable gave a stark, almost defiant presence over the entire village. At one point it must have been far more striking to see sitting on that cliff side because the spire was gone, snapped off like a bone sticking out of the sky. Time had not been friendly to the church I guess and brought the spire tumbling down at one point. 

Where the spire must have landed was what held me in place as I got closer to where it would have fallen, a sight I still can’t believe even now. Drover Grave.

Beneath the jagged cliff where the old church stood the ground gave way to a huge pit the poem partly described and it was massive, way more massive than I thought it would have ever been. Just by looking at it I could easily tell you could park six, maybe seven cars across in each direction with room to spare. What made this wound in the earth so much more terrifying was how nearly perfectly symmetrical it was, a near perfect circle carved into the stone that even with modern day equipment you couldn’t make it this perfect let alone all those years ago. It looked carved out but that was impossible.   
  
This was Drover’s Grave, the very name etched into my mind just by looking at it, getting closer and closer to it with each step. I felt the same sort of fear my grandmother would give me when she spoke of this place, but now I didn’t need to hear those words anymore, the sight alone scared me to the core.

The moment I got to the edge I had to take a look, peering down into this open grave but couldn’t even see the bottom. It wasn’t just dark down there, it was like the darkness was a presence of its own, thick and heavy and seemed to swallow up the light before it could even reveal its secret. Even with the crashing waves nearby there wasn’t even a touch of water around or within the grave itself, it was bone dry. It was like Drover’s Grave was commanding the waves to never reach its edge, the waves always rushing out near it but always just out of reach from the stone it was carved into.

On the other side of Drover’s Grave where it just almost touched the cliffside there were still some remains of the church's spire, small pieces of wood painted white here. There were a few small pieces of support beams and more here and there but most of the spire was gone by now, probably down deep within Drover’s Grave at this point. The spire was probably the last thing Drover’s Grave consumed. Now that there was no one and nothing left to consume he laid there silently.



 We filled it up with tide born dead, 

Till live ones walked in there instead.



Did the people who lived here really just started offering themselves to it voluntarily? Why? What could they have possibly hoped to gain? How did something that was used to discard and dump whale bones turn into something so….ritualistic?

Now thinking about it, was there something down from the beginning, something waiting and hungering for them to offer more and just so happen to have a village form around it to feed it, or did the village simply create this beast themselves, throwing what they thought were scraps of past work only to give the beast they created a hunger for more than just bones, whispering to them to give it more until it took everyth

Fuck sorry, I forgot what I was going to say again.   
  
My head is pounding like it's about to split open. I had to drive back a few more kilometers just to make it calm down again. The rattling is slowly getting louder and louder and I can’t seem to shake it. The road in front of me just looks like a wall now that's slowly driving me back to that damn place. It's not just the rattling though, there that voice again, keeps saying the same thing over and over again. I’m going to try and finish this post the best I can, I need to tell you what happened, to warn you all not to come.   
  
While I was standing on the edge of Drover’s Grave I knew I had to get down there. I had packed plenty of rope to climb down, even took the time to learn how to attach and climb down there properly, but to my surprise there was already another way down.   
  
Closest to the shore line started what looked like a jagged stone scare case carved out of the side of the cave walls, spiraling down the entire length until the darkness consumed it, never revealing just how far down they really went. They were not small either, the stone-like steps stuck out a good 5 feet in length, plenty of space for me to make my way down with ease. They looked like the cave themselves made them instead of being hand carved or anything, but at this point that didn’t matter. I needed to get down there and see for myself what was really down there.   
  
Trust me when I say this, I was not trying to call my grandmother a liar or trying to disprove her. A part of me just had to find out what was true and what was not, for years she spoke of this place and probably didn’t know it was real herself when speaking of it. Still, a part of me had to see what was down there, maybe document it myself and show people that this place was indeed real.

That being said, I wasn’t stupid. The steps were pretty wide but one wrong step or slip and I would be falling down into a pit that I still did not know just how deep it was. I wasn’t ready to give myself up that easily and prepared myself a backup plan. To the side I pulled my backpack off, laying beside me as I grabbed some gear I had packed with me. I grabbed the rope, my hammer and a metal piton spike before getting to work looking for a crack or seem to force the piton into. It took me a bit to find a proper one but finally I did manage to find a good one near the edge of Drover’s Grave which almost felt like it was made for this as I lined up the piton and hammered it in, making sure it was snug into the stone before tying the rope into the metal ring it provided. A couple of knots later with the rope tightly tied around my waist, I was ready to go!   
  
I won't lie, stepping near the edge again knowing I was about to descend down into this deep stone flesh wound scared me a little, I felt my heart race as I took my first step, the sound of my boot tapping on to the stone floor with each slow step I took, trying to be careful as I slowly made my way down.

I left my bag up top, I didn't want to bring extra weight with me when I descended downwards. The only thing I took with me was the flashlight I had packed, a foldable knife and my phone in case I needed to take a picture or record whatever was down there. I didn’t want to risk my life for anything else as step by step I went deeper and deeper down.   
  
Whatever was down there, I was going to see it face to face.

Tap…tap…tap

I was still slow as I made my way down, each step louder than the last as the sounds of the world around me started to fade. I wasn’t even that far down and yet the world outside of Drover’s Grave seemed to fade away into the distance. The wind, the crashing waves, even the gulls who flew over top seemed to become more and more quiet as I went further and further down this cave's gullet, worst of all I was starting to be consumed by the darkness within it, the light above becoming dimmer and dimmer like the darkness was a form of fog. My flashlight could barely cut through the darkness at times, its reach becoming shooter with each step downwards as my free hand held the rope tightly like the life line it was supposed to be.

Tap…tap…tap.

My boots were the loudest thing now as the outside world went silent, only a dim light from the sky above me seemed to fade more and more even if it wasn’t that far from where I was. I was crossing some invisible threshold at this point and the only way to go was down.

Tap…tap…tap.

I clutched my flashlight tightly until my knuckles were white, shaking just a little the deeper I went down this grave of a hole. The darkness had now consumed the light above me, leaving me with just a faint memory of what the sun looked like before I entered as I slowly kept marching forward, the reach of my flashlight becoming shorter and shorter as I went. Any further down and the flashlight would be better off just turned off. I was just thankful I could see at the very least three to four steps ahead of me, giving me some space to make sure I wasn't just going to fall down this grave and fill it with new bones. 

Tap…tap…tap.

Then I started to hear it finally.   
  
At first I stopped, unsure of what I was actually hearing. I must have thought I was imagining I heard something, the silence down there was deafening to me at that point, but I heard it again, a small rattle of some sort deep down inside the hole.   
  
It was small at first, like the wind had shaken something loose, but down in Drover’s Grave there was no wind, no breeze or anything. It was cold and still, yet I could hear something down there. Just as it started it stopped for a moment, making the cave silent before starting back up again but with more rattling with it, louder each time it started again in an unusual rhythm. There was a pattern to it now as it started up then died off again, repeating over and over again with more chiming in each time it came alive.   
  
Eventually it was just small rattles anymore, there were beginning sounds coming from below like larger bones tapping against each other, set to match with the rhythm of the small rattles scattered across the floor of this grave as it kept going, never ending now into a soothing like sound.

It was all I could hear as I stood there motionless, my eyes looking down at the bottom I could not see but hear instead even as my body screamed at me to run, to get the hell out of there, yet I didn’t. The sounds, the rhythm, they were soothing to me like they were calling me to join them, wanting me to join in and become part of this new sound I had never heard of before until now. I think I smiled at one point, happy to be there for a brief moment as I stood there and took in the sounds of old below me.   
  
Man made or not, I felt comfort standing there.  
  
That comfort was shattered when I heard something new chime in, a metal like sound that tapped out of place compared to the music. It was distant above me when I looked up, darkness hiding it from my sight as I heard it get closer and closer down into Drover’s Grave. I only got a quick second to see it fly past me, a small metal spike zipping past my sight as it descended further down into the hole.   
  
It was the piton that held my rope in place and the rope followed behind it.  
  
The rope wrapped around my waist felt a small tug the moment the length of the rope ended, hanging over the edge of the stone steps as it hung over the edge and further down then what I could see. It wasn’t until the rope went tight I was pulled out of the cereal sense of calmness that my panic started to kick in, feeling it become tighter and tighter, pulling on me more and more.   
  
One rough pull made me fall on to my side, my hip being the first to move towards the edge as I tried to grip for something to keep myself in place, a struggle I had no proper way of getting out of. I dropped the flashlight at that moment as my hands went for the knife, the only thing I could think of to free myself before being pulled over the edge. 

I brought the knife to my waist, cutting into the rope as fast as I could as I was being slowly pulled to the edge, only second away from being dragged into the gaping mouth of this grave and probably fall to my death. My mind was running miles trying to focus on what I needed to do, cutting deeper and deeper into the rope until not only was I free from the rope, I felt the tip of the knife dig into my shirt, a sudden and sharp pain hitting me at the same time. The rope whipped around my waist, streaks of blood soaking into it before watching it flick over the edge and down into the hole. 

I laid there with heavy breath, grabbing the flashlight with my right hand with my left hand pressed where I had cut myself in disbelief of what had happened. I know that position was secured, I know I placed it properly and I know it could have held my weight and more if needed. How the hell did it come loose like that? Was I wrong and maybe messed it up or was it something else? 

It didn’t matter anymore, my one way of making sure I was secured was gone and now Drover’s Grave was silent once again. I got to my feet, pointing the flashlight down the middle of this gaping hole in the earth to see if I could see anything, but I couldn’t. 

 ""C’mon down b’y, we’ve been waitin’ fer ya."" An old and distant voice raised up from below, echoing across the walls of Drover’s Grave as I felt something shift around me. 

The cave felt like it was stirring awake, the wall shook slightly as the stone beneath me felt slicker than before like water was finally making its way down here finally after all these years. 

I had awakened Drover’s Grave.

I had to get out of there, I had to leave as fast as I could. 

I never moved as fast as I did while I was getting out of there, the taps of my feet slamming on the stone steps pushing me to move faster and faster. Trying to go faster was becoming harder and harder to do as each piece of stone I touched was now becoming wetter and wetter from water, making each step slippery and harder to keep myself standing as I pushed myself upwards. Drover’s Grave had a taste of me and it’s mouth was watering to eat me whole. 

The higher I got the smaller the steps started to look like they were being pulled back into the walls of this grave, trying to make me fall down into his hungry mouth, but the more I pushed on the more light started to appear above me. I threw my flashlight away, both hands hugging the wall to keep me stable, my hands scraping against the wall as I pushed myself closer and closer to the top.

The pale blue sky above was in the open now, the sound of the outside world was calling out to me louder and louder. The steps were much smaller by then, nearly a foot wide now as I kept forcing myself to keep going, my strength fading quickly, the rattling…oh god the rattling below was so loud and violent to hear, the once soothing music it made now angered by my need to run, threatening me with the sounds of the predator it really was. 

Near the end I had no choice but jump for the edge of the grave, my arms just reaching up and over the lip of the cave as I forced every ounce of strength I had left in me up and over, rolling a foot away from the mouth of the cave until my back laid on the cold wet stone below be. My breathing was wild, my body shook from the fear that was forced out of me, yet I was out. 

The rattling was now gone, but not the voice. 

""The Grave’s got yer name on it now, b’y.” The voice spoke up and out of the mouth of Drover’s Grave, holding back a low laugh as it spoke. “And what’s been called don’t stay gone for long."".

I can’t tell you how long I ran for after I caught my breath, I left everything I had there and just ran like my life depended on it. My life did depend on it, I just didn’t know it until now. The further I drove away from that place the louder it called to me, it started off quietly at first but now…now it's the only thing I can hear as I write this to you. The rattled sounds of those bones still violent in nature, singing out to me like I have no choice but to go back to it and I don’t, I don’t think I have a choice any more.



Don’t start the tune. Don’t dig. Behave. 

You can’t unhear *The Drover’s Grave*



It has me, it has its tune hooked into me like a hook on a line and yet I can’t do anything but fight it until I’m pulled right back in. The longer I wait the worse it gets and worst of all I know I’ll be pulled right back into that damn grave. I shouldn’t have come here, I shouldn’t have gone looking for a ghost town cursed from the start. Now the only thing I can think of is how I woke it up, I climbed down its cold corpse and awoke it from its slumber with a little taste of me. 

I know I'm a dead man but how far is its reach? How far can it lure people in now that it's awake again after all of these years? Have I condemned those near it to its call now? How long until it goes back to sleep? I have so many questions yet I am the only one to blame for this, it was my fault to seek it out like I did and brought this on to the rest of the world around it.

I’m going to drive back to where that cabin was and camp in my car for the night, maybe being closer to it will allow me to clear my mind just a little. A part of me hopes I can break this curse now placed on me but I don't think I will. 

I think I’m screwed. 

I don’t know how many of you will read this, I don’t even know if the signal on my phone will even get it out there but please don’t come looking for me. 

Don’t try to be some hero and save me from this curse.

My ex-boyfriend (31m) and I (27f). We have been together for almost 4 years, and I love him so bad. We laugh, we kiss, and he shows me that he loves me too. But the problem is, I'm the one who comes into his house, and we stay there. In our whole relationship, we stayed only at his house. He never shows me to his friends or family.  
It's just like I'm stuck in his house.  
One time I asked him, ""Let's go outside and go to a restaurant like a date,"" and he agreed, but he told me, ""Not now, maybe next week. Which I understand. But the date has come. I've been waiting and waiting for him to invite me to go outside, but nothing has happened. Just because I love him so much, I understand him and move forward, not to mention the date again. but when the time comes, I feel bored for always being at home, and our routine is always the same. So I decided to break up with him even though I love him so much and know that he is not yet ready for commitment. I feel like we are just playing.  
As the years passed, I met my boyfriend (37m). We are happy and have been together for 3 years, turning 4 this year. That's the opposite of my ex; he shows me his world. I know his friends, I know his family, we go outside every day off, and we bond together, but the problem is that I love him (and I do love him) but not like my ex. Still, my heart keeps staying on my ex, and I want to forget him so bad. for the sake of my boyfriend now.  
One time, I accidentally saw my ex in a coffee shop, and this is when my heart started beating fast. We talked again and laughed for a long time after not seeing each other, and I really missed him. He asked me if I had a boyfriend now, and I said yes. I saw his sad face, and he told me that he missed me. We finished our talk and exchanged contacts. Since this happened, I haven't told my boyfriend.  

PS: I need some advice, and please don't hate me.  

TL;DR I really love my boyfriend, AITAH for still having feelings for my ex.",1,1750884263.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

1lkgyzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlasticFreeLiving/comments/1lkgyzw/does_anyone_have_experience_with_this_seemingly/,Does anyone have experience with this seemingly plastic-free coffee grinder?,"Hello Plastic-free community! I've been on the hunt for a plastic-free, electric burr grinder for a while now. There are many good quality low-plastic options out there, but like a true neurotic purist, I want none at all. The bean hopper has proven to be the real sticking point in this regard, and is unfortunately often the only plastic part of many otherwise attractive options.

My search has lead me to this product:

[https://www.amazon.com/Electric-Professional-Espresso-Settings-Stainless-steel/dp/B0D5YYMLGY/ref=cm\_cr\_arp\_d\_product\_top?ie=UTF8](https://www.amazon.com/Electric-Professional-Espresso-Settings-Stainless-steel/dp/B0D5YYMLGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)

It isn't cheap, and I don't like buying from Amazon, but it looks like it meets my standards regarding non-toxic materials. The bellows and splash guard never need to be used, so this appears to provide a platstic-free grinding experience. My issue is that I can't find any real info on this product or the company that makes it besides their own Amazon page, which is suspicious to me. However, they only have a 2024 and a 2025 model of their product, so maybe they're just an unknown, younger company. Almost all of their reviews are good, but there are only 34 of them, which I find suspect as well.

The brand name is owned by a company in Shanghai, and my googling found one unboxing review that looks genuine, a bunch of amazon-esque reselling in other countries, and this lone reddit post from last year:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1encgw1/fellow\_opus\_problem\_oring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1encgw1/fellow_opus_problem_oring/)

I messaged the person a few days ago, but they haven't gotten back to me. Seeing as their last post was 3 months ago, I'm not holding my breath.

  
All this to say, have any of you bought or used this grinder? Is it any good? I have this strange feeling that it's legit and just under the radar, but it's $269, and my goal here is to buy a burr grinder that I will use for many years, so I'm loath to just lay down the cash and hope for the best. Thanks in advance.

I was interested to learn about his politics despite he’s religion.

After hearing what he wants to do I am 1000% against him.

None of his ideas will make NYC better he’s a socialist. Where have these ideas actually worked in modern times. Never!

Free buses, community grocery stores? Tax the rich? All BS, the rich people of NY already pay all the taxes of the city. This will put NYC in billions of debt. 

Defund the police?? Did we not learn our lesson from BLM riots and constant looting that closes and shut down businesses in the city? Mom and Pop shops? 

Free housing?? NYC is already rent stabilized. It’s expensive because of the population. Anywhere millions of people are going to live is going to be expensive. 

$30 minimum wage??? So McDonald employees with no HS diploma or college degrees will make starting salaries of people with Master degrees??? Does that mean everyone gets a pay raise?? 

If so, rent and cost of living quadruple. $6000/month for studios, $30 coffees, $30 street hotdogs are you all ready for that? 

This guy will be a leftist democrat puppet another diversify hire. Again I don’t hate him as person but he will destroy NYC. 

Lastly, can anyone explain to me why Muslims and democrats Liberals like each other. 

Our religion is conservative by nature. 

He plans to promote LGBTQ/ trans ideology and ideas?? is that Islamic?? Modern Liberals don’t stand for anything. 


I’m just confused, I hold no hatred for him but as an American Muslim I don’t get why Muslims are on the liberals side? We don’t share any common values.

I know I’m young (f13) and I shouldn’t be thinking this way, but I can’t stop. I thought I was getting better. Recently, literally 5-10 minutes ago, I was feeling a little hungry and I had eaten only half a turkey sandwich at like 12 and I didn’t finish the cup of coffee I made either, so I “allowed” myself to get a snack. I wanted to have some ramen, because I hadn’t eaten any in a pretty long time and it was one of my favorite foods before I started getting into this negative headspace. One of the things I’ve caught myself doing “in recovery”, I say in quotes because I know I’m not getting better and most likely won’t for a while, is that whenever I get up to eat/grab a snack i’ll always ask my sister or like another family member if they want some too. I never did that before, not really relevant to this either, but I just wanted to share that. She said no, and after like 15 minutes of thinking should I make some, should I not make some, I kinda just went fuck it I’ll just run the calories off later. I was pretty upset at that, not because she said no, but because I was just beating myself up in my head thinking like it’s so pathetic that you’re feeling down because of that blahblahblah. I just felt stupid, because i ended crying a little too and I didn’t know why it was such a big deal when I really thought I was getting better. After making it, I took two bites and threw it out. It used to be my favorite snack ever like I stated beforehand and I loved how it tasted so much, but the second after I took those two bites, i felt immensely disgusted. It just didn’t taste good. Not because I made it wrong, but because all I was thinking about in that moment was how shameful it was that I felt so fucking grossed out with myself for even thinking of eating this food. Something that in retrospect to some people is the least of their problems. Just the disappointment and self hatred that i felt because I caved made it impossible to thoroughly enjoy those two bites i had. I just don’t understand why this keeps happening when I think im getting better. i might delete this soon. im not really even sure why i decided to write this. i just dont know why it keeps happening.",1,1750883905.0,eating_disorders,0,1.0,False

I was an NA/RA until late 2023. Left thinking I could find a better paying job with a better life balance but haven’t been too successful and considering returning but have a few questions. I’m in the KC division.

How are things these days? I’ve been lurking and seeing lots of changes with the coffee bar and small things here and there but just curious on how the work environment is now.

Have bonuses stayed similar, gone up, or gone down? I saw some comment saying they went down but was curious by how much or if even true.

How does FLEX differ from ERP? I was an ERP and liked the $3 pay bump but my base store was always better than where I’d end up.

When we were sat watching a movie, he sat next to me. At this point we were sharing a blanket and pillow, with our legs resting against each other. The first ten minutes of the movie, I counted he glanced at me me four times. The fifth time I look at him and he shot his head away.

When he was stood behind me, I turned to look at him, the same thing happened again.

Other times, he'll hold his stare and we just look at each other with a look of understanding, or a blank expression. He will sometimes smile back me, if I do so first.

\- Watching movies and shows (YA, drama, horror, rom coms, anime, reality trash, YouTube house tours, Mayday: Air Disaster) Movie and wine night anyone?

\- painting

\- games & puzzles

I wasn't able to reach out to everyone who commented when I put up my previous post on Introvert Women's Friendships. Reddit had put a block on me from initiating private messages since my account was new.

So I apologize if I didn't follow up to messages.

I'll make this easier by [**posting up this group link** ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gracefulmindscollective)and introverted ladies can join whenever you feel comfortable.

It will have a few questions and the Moderators will screen everyone carefully before they let people in. This is for the safety and well-being of the group since some members may have anxiety, social anxiety, or be highly sensitive. Anonymous/empty profiles are not permitted in. It may take time for approval since we're not always online, so if you miss out on getting into the group before this weekend's meet, we will have another meet in mid-July as well.

We spent three great days together, talking, laughing, flirting. On the final day, I asked if she was single — she smiled, said yes, and invited me to come visit her. I was surprised but excited, and we kept texting — playful, flirty, with her teasing outfits she’d wear for me.

I flew out to visit. First night was warm and fun — she even said she wore a dress “just for me.” The next day we were on a walk and went into plenty of fancy coffee shops and walked along the coast. After a nice moment in a coffee shop I gently asked if she would like to hold my hand, she froze and said That’s only something she'd do when being with someone a long time. It got awkward. I backed off, but the mood completely shifted. Straight after, we took a train, silence the entire trip and that was the last I saw of her. No goodbye in person and the rest of the trip I spent on my own. 

Next morning, she messaged saying I came with “the wrong expectations” and it wasn’t fair to expect her to “jump in to things” I was stunned — I had only followed her invitation. 

I didn’t reply to that. 

I’m autistic and sometimes question if I misread things. But this felt like a real shift — like she invited me under one impression, then backed out without really talking to me. It’s painful. I don’t expect a relationship from every spark, but I do expect honesty.

I’m looking to upgrade my coffee setup. Right now, I’m using a cheap battery-powered grinder (it *does* have burrs), and while it works pretty well for my Moka pot, it produces a lot of fines when grinding coarser, which messes up my V60 brews.

I use a V60 with white Hario filters, and I’ve been getting cups that are more bitter than I’d like - I suspect it’s due to over-extraction from all the fines.

While I know manual grinders can give better results at a lower price, I’m leaning toward an electric grinder for convenience. Ideally, I want something compact (So probably not Encore). Right now, both the Fellow Opus and Ode Gen 1 are under $200, which is pretty much my budget cap. I make about one cup a day and usually add a splash of milk (don’t hate me), so I don’t need anything *too* fancy.

My main question is: would either the Opus or the Ode 1 be a solid upgrade for consistent filter coffee (vs. my $30 battery grinder), and can they also handle grinding fine enough for a Moka pot? If not, what other options there are?

Thank you for all the thoughtful comments on that thread!

There have been some interesting developments since the original post. Ex-Evangelical and anti-MLM Youtube creator, the Antibot, posted a video ([The Fashion Influencer to Far Right Pipeline | VIVACIOUSHONEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygsVFFfKPAA&t=140s)) addressing Vanessa's sudden content change and used the original reddit post in the video. The video does not make direct jabs at Vanessa aside from calling her RAYN brand a ""snooze fest"". The video mainly points out other problematic Christian Influencers that are influencing Vanessa's faith journey such as Girls Gone Bible, Cliffe and Stuart Knechtle, and Ashley Hetherington.

Vanessa made a video addressing the ""hate"" she's been getting ([I Lost the World But Gained My Soul | Freedom in Christian Suffering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ClvoT2R2vk)). Stating that as Christians and children of God, suffering is guaranteed and that they must bear their cross as representatives of Christ. She cited John 15:18-25 ""If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first"". She denied the comments that claimed her conversion and content change was for the sole purpose of making money. Her counter claim was that her income has plummeted and has had to dip into her savings. She addressed the change in her content again in her most recent reel, stating that she's retired her former ""baddie"" persona and the change has helped her mental health and self-image.

The Antibot responded back with another video ([I criticized her. Now she's claiming persecution. | VIVACIOUSHONEY Response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk3h-aH2u8E&pp=0gcJCc4JAYcqIYzv)), stating that Vanessa is misconstruing the criticism and claiming Christian persecution is offensive to marginalized groups facing actual discrimination in the US. Citing the anti-LGBTQ+ bills passed in Texas. Taylor also empathizes with Vanessa as a fellow content creator stating that income in this industry can be very inconsistent and that she also has received her fair share of hate comments but that it is to be expected and comes with the territory. Her piece of advice was that finding fulfillment in external sources or a ""identity"" will never work and to instead seek balance.

As I stated in my original post, I see the good and bad sides of Christianity. I believe in pluralism and have a humanistic view of the world. Christians in a majority of the world are not persecuted and are in the fact the dominant religion and Churches as institutions hold immense power. Being mocked or getting their privilege checked is not persecution in the slightest. 

I still stand by my theory that Vanessa's faith is genuine and I'm happy that she's found community and meaning but she is frankly being mislead by the the culture surrounding this version of Evangelical Christianity.

Now for my take, I was very charitable to Vanessa in my first post but I will not hold back for this one. She is so out of touch and delusional at this point. I'm especially annoyed and disappointed because we're in the same age group, both Asian-American, from the same area and somehow our understanding of the world drastically diverged. 

The reasoning behind her counter claim that her income has plummeted is such nonsense. She blames it on sponsors and her following not welcoming her new Christian content, but doesn't take any time to reflect on changing consumer trends, ad revenue going away for all content creators, volatile global economy, and never addressing the recent TikTok ban and how the platform has changed since its return. The world is so much bigger and more complex than the one she is making up in her head. She claims she's not doing this for material gain but I'm pretty sure all her content is being monetized and she has a ""Faith"" section on her Amazon storefront. 

Since RAYN isn't shipping orders to the US anymore, she's completely abandoned the brand and removed it from her bios. I always wondered how successful or profitable it actually was to begin with. I now think it was all manufactured and she poured a lot of money in it to get it started, basically a bad investment and poor financial management on her part. Like why do you need an assistant? And then to become best friends with her which comes off as unprofessional when there's an obvious power imbalance.

The points she's making in her podcast are regurgitations of Evangelical, Nationalist, and Fundamentalist propaganda:

(1) Surrendering your anger, shame, and anxiety to Jesus sounds freeing and beautiful but her conclusion is that ""justice"" will passed by God and eternal bliss will be found in his kingdom of heaven basically AFTER WE DIE. I'm sorry but if following religion doesn't include protecting and fighting for the rights of the marginalized and vulnerable during our lifetime; your religion is a means of pacification and cope.

(2) Being on ""fire"" for Jesus is a feedback loop to make followers more zealous and extreme. It's a phrase used to shame and dismiss doubters, those who are deconstructing, or have left the faith all together. 

(3) She praises work if it is work being done to glorify the Lord; ""your manager isn't your boss, Jesus is your boss!"" She uses changing diapers, making coffee, and sweeping floors as examples of ""work"". I personally view ""work"" through the lens of Marx's theory of labor under capitalism. Work is a means of survival and not a luxury. Marx argued that under capitalism, labor becomes alienated from its product, the process of labor, and from humanity itself. The labor theory of value claims that the value of a commodity can be objectively measured by the average number of labor hours required to produce that commodity. Capitalists then exploit the value created by labor by paying laborers unfair wages. Marx's theory has inspired class consciousness and organized labor movements through unionization. The way Vanessa describes ""work"" is just anything that requires effort and doesn't even make the distinction if it is paid or unpaid. 

(4) Describing the Bible as the authoritative word of God and followers as children, sons, and daughters rubs me the wrong way. I understand the literary and symbolic meaning of it but in practice and real-life application it's simping for authority and self-infantilizing. I think a healthier alternative would be the therapeutic approach of inner child healing and reparenting oneself. Or y'know actually going to therapy...

(5) Vanessa gets a lot of misogynistic comments which I think are gross and wrong. But rather than confronting it as a symptom of patriarchy, she just ignores them and chooses to make modest fashion content. Obviously it's her body and it's her choice. For me, learning about feminist theory and deconstructing internalized misogyny has been way more helpful and productive. 

(6) Satan, demons, spiritual warfare, hell and sins are not real. Believing that non-believers or people who disagree with you are being controlled by the ""enemy"" is not healthy and can be dangerous. Treating non-believers or people who follow other religions as potential projects waiting to be converted and saved is the worst part of Evangelicalism. It's utterly dehumanizing.

(7) She claims that all Christians regardless of denomination should all just get along. This really exposes that her beliefs are just Jesus-pilled and similar to the Jesus movement or Jesus Freaks of 60s/70s. It's really naive and ignorant to think this way because it ignores all the historical and cultural context that has lead to this point.

(8) She claims that if you're a Christian that you MUST go to Church. Many comments have pointed out that Vanessa is very new to the faith and is not qualified to be making such public claims in the name of Christianity. Telling people that they have to do anything to fit into the mold is crossing that line. It's also inconsiderate and invalidating of a person's experience and their relationship to God.",29,1750882535.0,asianamercianytsnark,4,0.95,False

Lord, faith, war, infantry...","
Published by Karina

Lord, faith, war, infantry...

When I fought in the infantry, there were a lot of deaths nearby, in the morning you drink coffee with him, and at lunch you take him out. 
There was a lot of that, but I stayed alive, although I was always next to the guys in positions, our company changed three times, and I'm alive. 
What am I for, I was 100% sure that someone will die or live, the Lord decides, because there is no logic in war, the best prepared die, and Uncle Vasya the alcoholic is alive. 
Therefore, if the Lord decides to take a person, he will take him, but nothing will help. 
And another situation, a tank shell 5 meters away, 152mm into the roof of a house, carried the body of a comrade 3 kilometers under mortar fire, but the mines lay 10 meters from us, I am alive and returned home, before it was time. 
 When we talked with the guys in the unit and discussed the death of our comrades, I said the time had come, the Lord took him. 
And someone was surprised that he remained alive, it was not yet time, we said, it was not yet time. 
Everything is the will of the Lord, he decides, we are surprised, how is this so, it is bad, the death of a brother, a man. 
But the Lord takes a person at the best time for his soul. He is not a despot, not a tyrant, he only wants good for a person, his best creation. 
Therefore, he takes him at the best time for a person. 
Once the Savior was walking with his disciples on the road, and the disciples saw a cripple on the side of the road. 
They asked him for what sins this cripple lost his legs, the Lord replied, ""If he had legs, he would walk the whole earth with fire and sword."" I mean, we do not know what awaits a person in the future, maybe now is the best time. 
 Another story, once, around the beginning of the 1900s, a child was born, but after a while he became very ill, the mother's doctors said that the child would not survive. 
That maternal prayer, she begged the Lord for the child, the doctors were surprised, because there was no chance of recovery.
 And so, the boy grew up, became an adult man, and headed the commission for the destruction of Orthodox churches in the territory of the former USSR.
 In fact, we do not know what is best for us, what is best for a person, we think it is good, but after a while it can turn into evil. 
Therefore, if the Lord takes a person, then this is the best time for his soul. 
Why the best time? 
There is an opinion among the holy fathers that the Lord takes under two conditions (either one or the other) when a person's spiritual development is as high as possible and until it has fallen, or when a person spiritually falls below the level at which he is now, and will never rise again. 
Why is this so important?  
Because after death, the soul of a person will appear before the Lord, but he will not judge that soul, but the soul itself will judge itself. 
How is that so? 
The thing is that every soul is very valuable to the Almighty, and he loves all his sons and daughters regardless of the number of sins, and somehow it does not fit in the head when we say that the Lord is love and he does not wish evil, but because for the sins that a person committed, for example, only 75 years of earthly life, to send this person's soul to hell forever, right?
 Somehow it does not fit, ""The Lord is love itself"" and ""he will condemn the soul of a person to eternal darkness.""
 So, the soul of a person itself will determine for itself the place where it will be, whether in heaven or in hell.
 You will say that everyone will choose heaven, no, he will not be able to, if a person did not live according to the truth all his life.
  Conscience is sharpened there 1000 times, if while on earth our conscience sometimes torments us and we cannot sleep or eat, then when it sharpens 1000 times, will the soul be able to judge itself untruthfully?
 We learned on earth to drown out our conscience, with entertainment, drinking, work, it won't work out there. 
And the soul will judge itself where to go.
 Why would the soul of a sinner send itself to hell? There was a movie, a card player met a girl, but he lost a lot of money and got into big debts.
 That girl loved him so much that with incredible efforts she got the money, and gave it to him, saying, pay off the debts, and we will live happily ever after with you. 
He took the money, but decided to go all in, and lost again.  
When she found out about this, she didn't grieve for him, she just said how much she loved him, and that the most important thing was that they were together, and that she would find that money again and everything would be fine.
 And now her love became so unbearable for him, his conscience gnawed at him so much for what he had done, that he drove her away from him. 
So is the soul before the Almighty, he will be happy with everyone in paradise, but the soul of a sinner will condemn itself to hell, because the love of the Lord will be unbearable for it. 
It will not be able to accept his love.
 And even here the Lord is the Good Lover of Man, he created hell, a place where there is no Lord and his love, for those souls who will not be able to be with him in the rays of his love and glory.",5,1750882496.0,MilitaryTrans,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Cubs vs. Cardinals: A Midsummer Night's (Potential) Homerun**  
**June 25, 2025 | 10:45 PM ET | Busch Stadium**

The Cubs (-150) and Cardinals (+130) clash in a NL Central slugfest, with the total set at **8.5 runs** (Over: 1.8-2.05, Under: 1.9-2.0). After the Cubs won Game 1 8-2, the Cards are hungry for revenge—and their fans are probably already brewing coffee for a long night.

**Key Props to Bet (or Not Regret):**

* **Seiya Suzuki** (Cubs): Over 1.5 hits (-150). Let’s be real, Suzuki’s got more power than a hot dog cart at a baseball game.
* **Nolan Arenado** (Cards): Over 0.5 HRs (+325). If he doesn’t go deep, maybe he’ll just… *disappear*.
* **Erick Fedde** (Cubs SP): Under 2.5 ER (-155). Fedde’s ERA is lower than a comedian’s dignity—**take the under**.
* **Matthew Boyd** (Cards SP): Over 3.5 strikeouts (-286). Boyd’s got more control than a toddler on a sugar rush.

**Why the Cubs Might Win:**  
They’ve got Suzuki, Hoerner, and Happ—three guys who could hit for the cycle if given a participation trophy. Plus, Fedde’s ERA (3.12) is better than your dating profile.

**Why the Cardinals Might Win:**  
Arenado’s still got it (1.05 HR/AB) and Boyd’s walk prop is Under 1.5 (-125). If Boyd doesn’t throw a wild pitch, they’ll win by *technicality*.

**Final Prediction:**  
**Take the Cubs -1.5 (-200)**. The Cards will score, sure, but the Cubs’ offense is like a broken calculator—keep hitting it until something works. **Final Score: Cubs 5, Cardinals 4**.

*And if you bet on Suzuki’s Over 1.5 hits… congrats, you’re smarter than the Cardinals’ defense.* �⚾

1lkg893,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1lkg893/i_have_7_weeks_to_plan_my_first_trip_to_japan/,I have 7 weeks to plan my first trip to Japan. Please help me decide where to stay in Tokyo.,"For my husband’s 20th anniversary at his company, he was gifted a trip to anywhere in the world of his choosing. We are VERY lucky and grateful. We had very little time to book the trip - our children start school in late August and we need to travel while they’re still on summer break so that they can stay with their grandparents. Neither of us have ever been to
Japan, and it’s always been on our bucket list. So the flights have been booked, but nothing else. We’re flying into Tokyo on August 13th and home to LA on August 22nd.

I’m not sure if this is relevant, but I have ADHD and researching this trip feels particularly overwhelming for me. My brain is struggling to process the names of the cities and neighborhoods, and I can’t visualize the layout of Tokyo. I’m no stranger to big cities as a lifelong Angeleno, so I know it’ll all click once I’m there. ChatGPT has given me some recommendations, but I’m worried about putting this big of a decision in the hands of AI. I need real advice from people who’ve actually been there.

Here’s the rundown: We’re 38 and 42 year old parents who finally have the opportunity to travel without our young children. We like good food, whether it’s upscale restaurants, street vendors, or fish markets. We usually prioritize our food experiences while traveling. We enjoy sightseeing and being immersed in local culture. Tours, monuments, leisurely hikes, and cool bars or cafes are all right up our alley. My husband also wants to catch a baseball game. We are well past our nightclub era.

I would like to see the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, but without actually staying in the epicenter of all the action. I find too many flashing lights, sounds, and crowds to be overstimulating. I feel more comfortable in a relaxed setting that still has easy access to the train and some walkable spots for coffee, food, small shops, etc. Neighborhoods that have character, charm, nature, and either history or art usually appeal the most to me. We’re social people and also enjoy meeting locals and other tourists during our travels.

I definitely want to do a little trip to Kyoto while we’re there, but first things first - I need to prioritize where we’re staying in Tokyo. Any recommendations for locations that would match our easygoing vibe? I’ll also welcome hotel recommendations as well. We want to be comfortable and enjoy ourselves, so we don’t mind splurging a bit.",0,1750882450.0,JapanTravelTips,32,0.39,False
