1qld5yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/RSwritingclub/comments/1qld5yq/tipping_point/,Tipping Point,"Before the second drink slid down my throat I was a mess. Purely wretched, filled with diabolical malaise. Shaking like the West Coast and sweating like the Amazon. Thick, putrid drops of beaded ammonia slid down my wrinkled forehead and practically served as nature’s bitters; a splash or two in the gin won’t hurt anyone. The first one settled my fingers but didn’t do much as far as the brain was concerned. If anything, it made me more irritable. A taste of what I wanted turned my little demons feral. What a disgrace. And it’s only noon or so.

I’m lurking in the kitchen in front of my father. He’s left a knife on the tipping point of the sink in case another peanut sandwich entices him. I’m shivering from my abstinence but I’m on my way. My hands are hot and the fridge cools them while I wait for him to pass. He surely heard me kick the freezer shut. That’s why he hasn’t said anything. Yellow mustard stares me down. Do I take a squirt to cover up the smell? Will he notice if I walk by stinking like a mouthful of condiments? A hotdog? His nose isn’t sharp, never has been. I would have been grounded more often as a teenager. Where’s the leftovers? Maybe my breath won’t make its way to the coffee pot.

Pass the milk, he says, and shut the door if you’re not going to eat anything.

I’m just looking for a snack, I reply, almond or regular?

Almond’s your moms.

Alright, here you go. My hand extends as far as the sink and I duck back into the lower centigrade again. I can tell he’s looking at me through the insulation. Superman vision, MRI accuracy.

You alright? He shuffles towards me.

Yeah, just hungry.

We have crackers, I think, mom’s out shopping, she’ll be back in an hour. His hand is on my back, and it’s going in circles. A bit handsy for the morning.

I got it, thanks. I move deeper into the fridge and grab a yoghurt tub. Shrug my shoulder. Vanilla bean. Dad’s lurking still but against the island now. His flip flops dragging. Pass a spoon? I ask.

Sure. The drawer slips open and the mustard glares at me again next to the Caesar sauce. My right hand grazes the bottle but there’s not enough time.

You sure you’re alright? He hands the spoon over. Our eyes do not meet.

Fine, yeah. The tub is full of spaghetti. Last week Tuesday.

Might not want to eat that, dad suggests.

I dip my nose in to smell it, turn around. Is it bad?

Toss it. Want a sandwich? His back is towards me. He’s reaching for a loaf on top of the microwave. His ankles are extended and his calves are flexed below his bathrobe. The knife tips into the sink and clatters on the drain. I jump. He laughs. What are you so shaky for? That spoon’s practically bent, you’re jittering so much.

It scared me, that’s all.

You’ve been shaking and staring at the fridge since I came down here. Have sandwich, you’re probably hungry.

Him, the mustard, and the stairs are gawking at me individually. Three options in front of me, but why are those the fucking options? Run, mask, or lean in. What’s he gonna say? What’s the harm in sitting with the man? My dad? He’s right, the spaghetti is rattling at a microwave level of vibration in my hand. And it’s not appealing; in fact, it stinks. I shut the door and toss the tub in the trash and sit at the island on the furthest barstool.

Coffee?

I nod.

Sandwich? The loaf is already open and there’s two plates out.

I nod again, tap my fingers on the quartz.

Grape or raspberry? He’s only got the grape out.

Raspberry.

He stops his knife mid spread, holding peanut butter on the bread like a wave. Grape alright?

Sure.

1qld529,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qld529/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_inlaws_when_my_husband/,AITAH for cutting off my inlaws when my husband died,"AITAH for cutting contact and ignoring a couple of messages from my mil.
Sorry this is long. For some background my husband died 6 months ago and we have 2 children 3 and 18 months. My husband was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in 2019. Prior to this I had a good relationship with his parents but there's always been a lot of dismissing of inappropriate behaviours between all members of the family. When my husband was diagnosed we lived with my in laws for 6 months while we got our head around things. I did not want to do this and decision were made without consulting me. I accepted the situation but was extremely depressed and even a bit suicidal at certain points but my husband at the time felt his family would be a good support. They weren't. I was his only caregiver throughout the duration of his treatment, stuck in a house i had no space or privacy. I also supported his mental health as they destroyed it along the way (eg making fun of him for being scared of dying etc) once we moved out we had an ok relationship with them but id be lying if I said I didnt carry resentment towards them and his siblings for a range of issues but was always polite and hoped things would change. All of which were swept under the rug. 5 years passed, treatment was going well and we had our 2 children. When I was pregnant with my youngest my in laws agreed to look after our first (My mil would have probably lost it if I asked anyone else.) while I was in hospital. I spent most of my days off work at their house helping him get used to them and their house (never left him there, i was there still caring for him) a few months later they posted in the family chat dates of their travel plans for the year. One trip was 2 weeks right over my due date. We raised this with them and things got heated. They told us we are all a burden and we take advantage of them which was very surprising to me because I had a traumatic childhood that shows up by me relying very little on other people. They also told us they dont care about grandchildren and it wouldnt matter to them if they didnt see them (they begged everyone in the family for grandchildren for years).

We attempted to repair things with them multiple times and everytime they doubled down so we went lower and lower contact with them for 2 years up until my husband's death. Anytime we would see them they would tell us to get over it and move on. We would say not until things are acknowledged and repaired instead of rug sweeping. My husband suddenly went downhill and on going to hospital found out the cancer was back and everywhere. It was very unexpected. He begged his parents to make things right. His dad finally apologised. The family came together for his final 2 weeks of life. I had brought him home with palliative care to die at home. I was still the sole person caring for him in everyway as well as our 2 children while completely heartbroken about the situation. I asked them to sit with him one morning to take my daughter to the doctor and as soon as I was gone they immediate said they were victims and I ruined their family. On his death bed my husband yelled at them and told them to get out. Still when he passed I called them so they could sit with him etc and split his ashes with his parents and siblings. They left me to do everything for his memorial and on the day despite having rsvped his mum didnt attend. No text no call, before or after. I messaged her a week later asking for an explanation. She blocked me.  Now 6 months have passed and she has reached out saying we should do coffee and she is free for baby sitting and helping with cooking because she promised her son she would be there for us so i should believe her word. Even if she was sorry which shes never said she is, I just dont want her around and I dont want this family near our children. My husband told me on his death bed to trust my instinct when it came to them and not to feel bad about cutting and running.
People keep asking if ive been in contact and whether Ill forgive them and let them back in as if thats something I should be aiming for. That it would be good for the kids to have them. 
We have friends and other family that have been absolute top tier support. In my mind I think this family is all so crazy and toxic, but AITAH? Should I be giving them another chance? Is my trauma history clouding this?

1qld3w7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qld3w7,PSA. Bad experience at this brunch place in Galle Fort,"I’ve been going to this café for a few days because I needed a place to work. I came in around 11:30 a.m. and was working quietly when, at about 1:30 p.m., a server asked me to move to a corner seat. I found it a bit odd because I was the only one asked to move, even though others had stayed longer than I had.

Shortly after, a woman who appeared to be part of management came over and again asked me to move to a seat that was quite uncomfortable. I tried to explain my situation, but she didn’t seem to consider it. She also mentioned that she had “let” me stay the whole day yesterday, which made it feel like I wasn’t being recognized as a paying customer, despite having ordered and paid for food and drinks.

She also said this is a brunch place and asked if I was “paying to stay for the whole day.” When I mentioned that I felt this interaction was unprofessional, she called me unprofessional in return. She then left without any apology.

Another server later agreed that the situation could have been handled better.

The problem wasn’t being asked to move — it was the way it was communicated. If it had been explained politely, I would have understood. Unfortunately, my work was disrupted, and the experience left me feeling unwelcome.

It was disappointing, especially because it felt like local customers might be treated differently from others.",1,1769228508.0,srilanka,0,0.67,False

Hey,

I know this is a long shot and I don’t really have expectations, but I’m curious to see what happens after posting here :)

I’m married (over 8 years) and have been ENM for about 4 years now. It’s definitely had its ups and downs, but overall it’s been a positive experience that’s helped me grow a lot. I’m mostly looking for a friendship with a woman in a similar situation—someone who gets the lifestyle, the nuance, and the importance of honesty. I really enjoy connecting with people who are thoughtful, open-minded, and genuine, and I’m curious about friendships that have a playful, flirty energy too 😏.

A bit about me: I’m very into science, love wandering through art exhibitions, enjoy hiking and bodyboarding, and I’m always down for a cute coffee date or cozy night with good conversation. I’m also really into tarot—so if you like exploring the intuitive side of things, that’s a bonus.

If any of this resonates with you, and you’re 30+ and in my area (and able to verify), feel free to send me a chat request. Would love to see if there’s a natural vibe ❤️",1,1769228397.0,polyamoryR4R,1,0.67,False

1qld1bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameGumshoes/comments/1qld1bj/game_gumshoes_presents_baron_smelly_bones/,Game Gumshoes Presents: Baron Smelly Bones Blueberry Hag Scented Dice,"**MFG: Studio Woe**

**#of Players: 1**

**Age Range: 8+**

**Sug. Retail: $ 25 USD**

**Overall Construction**: When you buy these you will get a set of 7 dice. D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, and a percentile die. They come in a tin with a slip cover. The die sit in a foam insert that contains the fragrance to keep them smelling. This particular set of dice has a Green and Blue marble look to them with Purple numbers.

**Gameplay**:  So this set of dice is different from most sets of dice that you will encounter. They will roll just like any other dice, but you do not want to add them in with your other dice. From what I understand, if they are left out of the tin eventually the dice will stop smelling.

**Yes/No Recommend**: These dice are incredible. We picked them up at Gencon. When we found the booth that sold these dice, I was talking to the creator of these dice. Someone opened up a tin of Coffee scented dice. They were probably 6 feet away from us when this happened. I couldn’t believe it hit me from that far away. 

We have had this set of dice for around 4 months and the smell is still strong. Admittedly, we don’t use them with every game, but the fact that they still smell so well after all this time is amazing. To me the Blueberry Hag dice smell like a blue raspberry fruit roll up. If I see them again at another convention I will try to pick up a different scent. There are many to choose from.

**Where To Get It**: As I said, I picked these up at Gencon. I have not seen these anywhere else. I think your best bet is to order them directly from Studio Woe’s website here.

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

Mind you I am overweight. The reason I stopped is because I was sick and tired of my nausea and diarrhea. Did/does anyone else experience this? Before carnivore, I was eating the standard nasty American diet pretty much my whole life. I decided to make a change and ate only 5 things: ground beef/ribeye/steak. Eggs. Cheese. Water with LMNT. And Coffee with heavy cream. I felt amazing and first and I started having diarrhea immediately. I know this can be normal because of the dramatic shift of the micro biome in your stomach. I was expecting it to go away after a few weeks even a month. But 4 months later, I was having almost explosive diarrhea still. My energy levels felt great, and I was down about 40 lbs but the stomach pains and needing to poop liquid after every meal was exhausting. Another thing to add was I was int fasting 16/8. 2 meals. Has anyone else experienced this? How did you get better? Is there something wrong with me? I reverted back to a carb lifestyle and I hardly have diarrhea anymore. Weird right? Someone help.

I finally decided to call her out so we can speak because we bareky got to work same shifts together. ""Date"" went good I believe, we went for a coffee and been there for 3 hours then we went to my car so I can drive her home and we stayed like 3 more hours in a car just talking and we even held hands for like 5 minutes but it was due to a bet and we just kept making excuses to not break the hold.

Anyways, its been like a week since that day and all of a sudden she stops texting because she is on vacation, I mean she is home but just got 10 days off the work and is soon going to a vacation with her 2 friends. She kinda stopped messaging for like 2 days because I didnt stay a bit longer when my shift was over and hers was starting and I left to protect her from colleagues because they noticed im staying longer and I didnt want to stay anymore so they dont spread the gossip that we are together and make it awkward for her. Ive been through that already and I dont mind but her brother works there who is protectful of her and obviously that would make it bad.

I apologized for that, she said its fine and that shes not mad etc. Then again I asked her after those 2 days if everything is fine but she is denying saying its all good and I somewhat believe her because I still dont know if she only looks me as a friend or she likes me.

We still keep sending tiktoks to each other (its maybe cringe) but we dont talk and we dont send so much to each other. I wanna speak with her why is she so distant from me since I apologized 3 times and wanna make it right but still I dont wanna ruin her vacation and have that hard talk. I dont wanna waste my time cause Ive been through this and I just wanna tell her that I like her but not in the way to make it hard for her if she rejects me. 

Should I wait for her to come back from vacation or say it before she goes cause honestly I hate thinking about guys hitting on her there??",1,1769227915.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1: The Third Wheel

The scent of truffle oil and aged mahogany should have been comforting. Le Jardin was the kind of restaurant where the lighting was always golden, the music was a soft hum of cello strings, and the prices on the menu didn't have dollar signs. It was the kind of place where one celebrated milestones.

And Aurelia Stephens had a milestone.

She smoothed the fabric of her navy dress beneath the table, her fingers tracing the hem nervously. \*Senior Architect.\* After three years of coffee runs and drafting revisions until her eyes blurred, she had finally been promoted. She looked across the table at the empty chair. Holden was late. Again.

""Water, miss?""

Aurelia looked up at the waiter, forcing a tight smile. ""No, thank you. I’m waiting for the rest of my party. He should be here any minute.""

The waiter’s eyes flickered with a pity that stung worse than a slap. ""Of course.""

Twenty minutes later, the heavy oak doors at the front of the restaurant swung open. Aurelia’s heart gave a little jump, instinctively seeking the familiar broad shoulders and sandy-blonde hair of Holden Bryant. She saw him immediately. But her smile froze before it could fully form.

He wasn't alone.

Clinging to his arm, looking like a fragile porcelain doll in a dress of pale cream chiffon, was Ellie.

Aurelia felt the familiar cold weight settle in her stomach—the same sensation she’d felt since she was sixteen, since the day she was introduced to the Stephens family as their ""long-lost biological daughter,"" only to realize the position of \*daughter\* was already occupied by the girl they had adopted in her place.

Holden guided Ellie through the tables with a protective hand on the small of her back, whispering something that made Ellie giggle softly, her head tilting to rest against his shoulder. They looked like the couple. Aurelia looked like the spectator.

""You’re late,"" Aurelia said as they reached the table, her voice quieter than she intended.

""Traffic was a nightmare,"" Holden said, dismissing the apology without actually offering one. He pulled a chair out—not for Aurelia, but for Ellie. ""Sit carefully, El. You know how your knees get when you stand too long.""

""I'm fine, really,"" Ellie murmured, flashing a wide, innocent doe-eyed look at Aurelia. ""I’m so sorry we crashed your date night, Aurelia. I just… I had a dizzy spell at the gallery, and Holden insisted on picking me up. I didn't want to be a burden.""

""You're never a burden,"" Holden said firmly, taking his seat. He finally looked at Aurelia. ""You don't mind, do you? We couldn't exactly leave her alone.""

Aurelia gripped her silverware. ""It’s our monthly dinner, Holden. I had something to tell you.""

""We can talk while we eat,"" Holden said, flagging down the waiter. ""Ellie needs protein. She looks pale.""

The dinner proceeded exactly as Aurelia feared. Holden and Ellie spoke in a shorthand language of shared childhood memories and inside jokes, discussing people Aurelia didn't know and events she hadn't been invited to. Aurelia ate her risotto in silence, the rich food tasting like ash.

\*Just say it,\* she told herself. \*Tell him about the promotion.\*

""Holden,"" Aurelia started, seizing a lull in the conversation. ""I actually got promoted today. The firm is giving me the lead on the—""

""Oh no!"" Ellie gasped.

Aurelia stopped. Ellie had knocked her water goblet over. The ice water cascaded across the tablecloth, splashing onto the sleeve of Aurelia’s navy dress.

""I'm so clumsy!"" Ellie cried, her hands fluttering to her mouth. ""Oh, Aurelia, I'm so sorry! Is it ruined?""

""It’s just water,"" Aurelia said, grabbing her napkin to dab at the cold wet patch seeping into her skin.

""Be careful, Aurelia,"" Holden snapped, his voice sharp.

Aurelia froze. ""Excuse me?""

""You're crowding her,"" Holden said, reaching over to dry Ellie’s hands with his own napkin, ignoring the water dripping off Aurelia’s elbow. ""You know she gets anxious when things spill. Stop making a scene.""

""I didn't do anything,"" Aurelia whispered, the injustice of it burning her throat. ""She knocked it over.""

""She’s shaking,"" Holden accused, his focus entirely on the trembling, teary-eyed Ellie. ""God, this table is too cramped.""

The waiter arrived to clean the mess, looking flustered. ""Sir, we can move you to a larger table, but we are fully booked. I only have a four-top near the kitchen, or...""

""That’s fine,"" Holden said, standing up. He helped Ellie up with the tenderness one might show a burn victim.

Aurelia stood too. ""Okay, let's move.""

Holden paused, looking at the layout of the new table the waiter was pointing to. It was a small booth. Cozy. Intimate. Enough for two people to sit comfortably, three to be squeezed.

""Actually,"" Holden said, looking at Aurelia with a vague annoyance, as if her presence was a logistical error he had to correct. ""Ellie needs to elevate her leg. The booth is tight.""

""So?"" Aurelia asked.

""So, she needs the bench seat,"" Holden said. ""And I need to sit next to her to make sure she eats.""

Aurelia looked at the booth. Then she looked at the single, hard-backed wooden chair the waiter was placing at the very end of the table, jutting out into the aisle where servers would be rushing past with hot trays. It was the kind of seat you gave a child, or an unexpected guest you wanted to leave.

""You want me to sit in the aisle?"" Aurelia asked.

""It’s just for an hour, Aurelia,"" Holden sighed, rolling his eyes. ""Don't be so sensitive. Ellie is in pain. Can you just—for once—not make everything about you?""

Aurelia looked at Ellie, who offered a sad, helpless shrug that didn't quite reach her eyes. Then she looked at Holden, the man she had loved for three years, the man she was planning to move in with. He wasn't looking at her. He was already fussing over the pillows behind Ellie’s back.

Aurelia sank into the hard wooden chair in the aisle, the cold water on her sleeve making her shiver. She was the third wheel in her own relationship.

\*\*\*

Chapter 2: The Cold Reality

The rain in Seattle was usually a mist, but tonight it was a deluge, hammering against the pavement in rhythmic sheets. Aurelia stood under the awning of the restaurant, clutching her purse to her chest.

Holden had paid the bill. That was the only boyfriend-like thing he had done tonight.

""I have the lease papers in my bag,"" Aurelia said, her voice raising slightly to be heard over the rain and the idling engine of the valet stand. ""We need to sign them by tomorrow morning, or we lose the apartment, Holden. It’s the one with the bay window.""

Holden was checking his phone, his brow furrowed. ""Yeah, yeah. The window. Look, Aurelia, I can't do this right now.""

""It takes two seconds to sign,"" she pressed. ""We've been talking about living together for six months.""

""Ellie's not feeling well,"" Holden said, pocketing his phone and looking around frantically for his car. ""That little episode at dinner... she thinks her heart is racing again. It could be a panic attack.""

""She ate a full crème brûlée five minutes ago and was laughing,"" Aurelia pointed out, her patience fraying into a thin, dangerous wire.

Holden whipped around, his eyes flashing with anger. ""You really have no empathy, do you? She’s fragile, Aurelia. Not everyone is as… sturdy as you are.""

\*Sturdy.\* The word felt like an insult. It meant she didn't need care. It meant she could be left out in the rain.

The valet pulled up Holden’s silver Lexus. Holden didn't open the passenger door for Aurelia. He opened the back door for Ellie, helping her slide in.

Aurelia reached for the front handle.

""Wait,"" Holden said, blocking her path. ""I'm going to take her straight to the ER just to be safe. It’s going to be a long night. Doctors, waiting rooms... you hate hospitals.""

""I am your girlfriend,"" Aurelia said, the rain blowing under the awning and soaking her shoes. ""I’m coming with you.""

""There's no point,"" Holden said, closing the door on Ellie and turning to face her. ""You have work tomorrow. That big promotion, right? Go home, get some sleep. I’ll call you when I know she’s okay.""

""But the lease—""

""Forget the damn lease, Aurelia!"" he shouted, snapping. People nearby turned to look. ""My childhood friend might be having a heart event, and you're worried about an apartment? You’re being selfish.""

He didn't wait for her response. He rounded the car, got in the driver's seat, and peeled away, the tires spraying dirty rainwater onto Aurelia’s shins.

She stood there, frozen. Not from the cold, but from the shock of it.

\*Selfish.\*

She turned away from the street, blinded by tears she refused to let fall, and walked straight into a wall.

No, not a wall. A person.

She stumbled back, dropping her purse. ""I'm so sorry, I didn't—""

She looked up. And up.

The man standing before her was imposing, clad in a charcoal suit that cost more than her annual salary. He had just stepped out of a sleek, black Rolls Royce Phantom that was idling at the curb, taking up the space Holden had just vacated.

The man didn't move. He looked down at her with eyes the color of steel—cold, sharp, and assessing. He didn't look annoyed; he looked bored, until his gaze landed on her face.

""You're wet,"" he stated. His voice was a low baritone that seemed to vibrate through the rain.

""I... my ride left,"" Aurelia stammered, bending down to grab her purse. Her hand shook.

The stranger’s eyes tracked the movement, then flicked to the street where the silver Lexus had disappeared. ""The man in the Lexus. He left you.""

It wasn't a question.

""He had an emergency,"" Aurelia defended automatically, though the lie tasted like bile.

""He had a choice,"" the man corrected.

Aurelia stiffened. She didn't know who this man was, but the aura of power radiating off him was suffocating. The valet attendants were standing at attention, terrified.

""Happy Anniversary,"" she whispered to herself, the irony finally breaking her.

The stranger tilted his head. He heard her. ""Anniversary?""

""Three years,"" she said, looking at the rain puddling around her expensive heels. ""He forgot.""

The man stared at her for a long beat. He looked at her soaked dress, her ruined hair, and the fire dying in her eyes.

""Get in,"" he said.

Aurelia blinked. ""Excuse me?""

The man opened the rear suicide door of the Rolls Royce. The interior was warm, glowing with soft amber light, smelling of cedar and expensive leather.

""I am not in the habit of repeating myself,"" he said, his expression unreadable. ""You are shivering, and you look like you are about to shatter. Get in the car.""

\*\*\*

Chapter 3: The Devil’s Proposal

The silence inside the Rolls Royce was absolute. It shut out the drumming of the rain and the noise of the city, creating a vacuum where only Aurelia’s ragged breathing existed.

She sat on the edge of the leather seat, careful not to let her wet dress ruin the upholstery. Across from her, the stranger sat with one leg crossed over the other, typing something on a tablet. He hadn't asked her where she lived.

""Here,"" he said, without looking up. He extended a handkerchief. It was white silk, monogrammed with initials she recognized from the business pages of the newspaper.

\*K.W.\*

Killian West. The heir to the West shipping and technology empire. A man known in the boardroom as ""The Reaper"" for how ruthlessly he dismantled his competition.

Aurelia took the handkerchief with trembling fingers. ""Thank you, Mr. West.""

He paused, finally locking the tablet and setting it aside. He looked at her, his gaze intense, dissecting her layers. ""You know who I am.""

""Everyone knows who you are,"" she murmured, dabbing the rain from her cheeks. ""I’m Aurelia Stephens.""

""I know,"" he said.

Aurelia paused. ""You do?""

""Biological daughter of the Stephens family, yet curiously absent from their board of directors. Junior architect at Tiller & Son. Currently in a relationship with Holden Bryant, heir to Bryant Industries. A relationship that, judging by the scene on the curb, is failing.""

Aurelia felt exposed, flayed open by his indifference. ""You’ve done your research.""

""I possess information. That is my currency."" He leaned forward slightly, the amber light casting shadows across his sharp cheekbones. ""I have a problem, Miss Stephens. And looking at you, I believe you have one too.""

""My problem is a forgotten anniversary and a lack of a ride home,"" she said defensively.

""Your problem,"" Killian countered smoothly, ""is that you are a placeholder. You are waiting for a man to choose you, and he never will. You are smart, capable, and clearly patient to a fault. But patience is a virtue of the weak when it yields no results.""

Aurelia opened her mouth to argue, but the words died. He was right.

""What is your problem, Mr. West?"" she asked instead.

""My grandfather is dying. To inherit his controlling shares and secure my position as Chairman, his will stipulates a condition. An archaic one."" He adjusted his cufflinks. ""I must be married.""

Aurelia’s eyes widened. ""And you... what? You want me to find you a match?""

""I want you to be the match.""

The air left the car. Aurelia laughed, a dry, brittle sound. ""You’re joking. You don't even know me.""

""I know you are clean of scandal. I know you come from a 'good family,' even if they treat you like a stray dog. And I know you are desperate to escape the loop you are stuck in."" Killian’s voice dropped, becoming dangerous and seductive. ""Marry me, Aurelia. It is a contract. One year. In exchange, I will give you the world Holden Bryant is too blind to offer you. Protection. Status. Wealth without limit. And most importantly... priority.""

\*Priority.\* The word hung in the air, glittering like a diamond.

""Why me?"" she whispered.

""Because you have hate in your eyes,"" Killian said softly. ""And right now, I need a partner who understands that love is a weakness, but power is a guarantee.""

He pulled a thick envelope from the seat pocket and placed it on the console between them.

""The contract. Read it. My driver will take you to your apartment. You have 24 hours to decide if you want to keep being the side character in your own life, or if you want to be the lead.""

\*\*\*

Chapter 4: The Last Straw

The next 24 hours passed in a haze. Holden didn't call. He sent a text at 10:00 AM: \*Ellie is stable. Staying at her place to monitor. Let’s do dinner tonight. I promise I’ll make it up to you. Luigi’s at 8?\*

Luigi’s was their spot. It was where they had their first date. It was a peace offering.

Aurelia sat at the small checkered table at Luigi’s. It was 8:00 PM. She wore her favorite dress, the red one Holden used to say he loved before he started telling her to dress more ""modestly"" like Ellie.

8:15 PM.

8:30 PM.

8:45 PM.

The waiter, a kind old man named Marco, refilled her water glass. ""He is coming, bella?""

""He promised,"" Aurelia said. The words tasted like ash.

She pulled out her phone. No texts. No calls. Her finger hovered over the Instagram icon. She shouldn't look. She knew she shouldn't look.

She tapped the app.

Ellie’s story was the first bubble. It had been posted twelve minutes ago.

It was a video. The camera was shaky, clearly held by Ellie. It panned over a glittering display case at Tiffany’s.

\*""Look what Holden is getting me to cheer me up!""\* Ellie’s voice squealed from the speaker.

The camera turned to show Holden. He was smiling—a genuine, warm smile that Aurelia hadn't seen directed at her in months. He was holding up a delicate sapphire pendant.

Aurelia stopped breathing.

It wasn't just any necklace. It was the \*exact\* necklace Aurelia had circled in a catalog six months ago. She had shown it to Holden. She had told him, ""If we ever get married, I don't want a ring, I want this sapphire.""

He had called it a waste of money then.

Now, he was buying it for Ellie because she had a ""tummy ache.""

Aurelia didn't cry. The mechanism inside her that produced tears had finally broken, snapped by the sheer weight of the betrayal. A cold, terrifying clarity washed over her.

\*I am done.\*

She stood up.

""Bella?"" Marco asked, worried. ""You are leaving?""

""He’s not coming, Marco,"" Aurelia said, her voice steady, devoid of emotion. She placed a fifty-dollar bill on the table. ""I’m not coming back.""

She walked out of the restaurant. She didn't go home to cry. She went home to work.

The apartment was quiet. She pulled her suitcase from the closet—the big one. She didn't pack everything. She left the clothes Holden bought her. She left the books he liked. She packed only what was hers. Her sketchbooks. Her grandmother’s locket. The red dress.

It took her forty minutes to erase three years of her life.

When the suitcase was zipped, she stood in the center of the living room. It looked disturbingly normal. If you didn't look in the closet, you wouldn't know she was gone.

She pulled her phone out. She found the number from the business card inside the envelope Killian West had given her.

She typed two words.

\*I’m in.\*

The reply came three seconds later.

\*Driver is outside.\*

\*\*\*

Chapter 5: The Silent Exit

The courthouse signing was anticlimactic. No white dress, no flowers, no organ music. Just the scratch of a fountain pen on heavy bond paper and the thud of a judge’s stamp.

Killian stood beside her, looking impeccable in a navy suit. He didn't smile, but when he handed her the pen, his fingers brushed hers. His skin was warm.

""No turning back now, Mrs. West,"" he murmured.

""I don't look back,"" she replied, signing her name. \*Aurelia West.\*

Two hours later, she was back at the apartment one last time. Killian waited in the car downstairs. He had given her ten minutes. ""Closure,"" he had called it. ""Scorched earth,"" she had corrected.

She didn't smash anything. She didn't cut up his clothes. That was what a crazy ex-girlfriend did, and Ellie would only spin that to make Aurelia the villain.

Instead, Aurelia stripped the bedsheets. She left the mattress bare. It looked cold. Unwelcoming.

She went to the kitchen counter. She took off the engagement ring Holden had given her—a modest diamond, one he had picked because it was ""sensible."" She placed it next to the coffee maker.

She took a piece of notepad paper and a sharpie.

She wrote three words.

\*I’m done waiting.\*

She left the key next to the note. She walked out the door, and for the first time in her life, she didn't lock it behind her. She wasn't protecting this home anymore.

\*\*\*

Holden Bryant was tired.

Ellie had been emotional all day, oscillating between excitement over the necklace and tears over her ""frail health."" It was exhausting being a hero.

He checked his watch as he unlocked the apartment door. 9:30 PM. Late. Aurelia would be annoyed about dinner, but he could smooth it over. He always did. He’d tell her Ellie needed him. Aurelia was reasonable. She was... sturdy.

""Aurelia?"" he called out, dropping his keys in the bowl. ""I'm home. Sorry I missed Luigi’s, things got crazy.""

Silence.

Usually, there was music playing. Or the smell of something cooking. Or at least the sound of the TV.

The apartment was pitch black.

""Babe? You asleep?""

He flipped the light switch.

The first thing he noticed was the cold. The window was cracked open, letting the damp Seattle air in.

The second thing he noticed was the echo. The apartment felt hollow.

He walked into the kitchen. ""Did you order takeout? I'm starving.""

He stopped.

The counter was bare, except for two small objects sitting under the harsh glare of the under-cabinet light.

The ring.

And the note.

Holden stared at the ring. It twinkled innocently. He picked it up, his brain failing to compute the data. \*Why is her ring here? Did she take it off to do dishes?\*

He looked at the note.

\*I’m done waiting.\*

A prickle of genuine fear, cold and sharp, spiked in his chest.

""Aurelia!"" he shouted, rushing to the bedroom.

He threw the door open.

The bed was stripped. The mattress lay naked and gray.

He yanked the closet door open. Her side was empty. No coats. No shoes. Just wire hangers clattering together, chiming like funeral bells.

""No,"" he muttered, shaking his head. ""No, no, no. Stop it. This isn't funny.""

He fumbled for his phone, his fingers slick with sudden sweat. He dialed her number. He had it on speed dial. \*My Sunshine.\*

He pressed the phone to his ear, his heart hammering against his ribs.

It rang once. Then a click. Then a mechanical, monotone voice that sounded like a judgment.

\*""We're sorry. The number you have dialed is no longer in service. Please check the number and try again.""\*

Holden lowered the phone. The silence of the apartment rushed in to crush him. She hadn't just left. She had deleted him.

At the start I was accepting everything but once I got more used to fair offers I got a bit more selective. My acceptance rate is quite high so I have a bit more freedom now. I don’t have receipts so this is a trust me bro. 

Yesterday an order came in. I had to drive 3 KM south to a grocery store, get 14 items and then drive 7 KM north (past where I was) for only like $12. I said nope and declined. Literally 10 seconds after they sent me the same order but from a store that was on the way to their place for $16. It was 3KM less for $4 more all cause I said no. 

Today it happened again. I live outside the zone I work in and when entering the city there is a small little area that often gets weird orders. I usually stop here and grab a coffee then wait a few minutes before an order comes. I often stop here before I’m done as often there will be a late night order to take on my way. 

I got a crazy order to drive 2 bags of popcorn 12KM for $5. lol I was like are you crazy? Yes I gotta go that way but you are sending me to the middle of nowhere for no money. Obviously I was the only driver in the area cause literally 1 minute later another order came in. This time it was a stacked order to get the popcorn then go get some food and take them to a similar address. They upped the pay to $16 for both. 

If you are new and got this far… be picky. Obviously if you want silver or platinum you need to accept a certain amount but don’t do something that will cost you more than they are giving you. The guy who broke his NDA said they have a desperation score. The higher it is the worse orders you will get. Be selective when you can and trust something will come through.

I remember it! My grandparents took me to the Toddle, once upon a time. (Everything seemed so much bigger then!) The Toddle House on Central was Route 66 Americana—Friendly, welcoming, attentive counter service: Early mornings, late nights, that unmistakable aroma: Main Street American Diner: Hot Coffee and Cocoa! Comfort Food! 

Toddle House: Mid-20th-century American dining culture, reflecting the values of community and comfort that diners aimed to provide, and often did even more.

**A Turn of the Page… End of an Era**

In its next incarnation… 2016? When Toddle became Farmacy: 

Well, thankfully at least the building survived the makeover. January 2026: The Neon Zia looks vintage, or really would at night, if it was lit. Even if the Era didn't survive, memories mark the spot. Now, and just very recently: Farmacy's gone too.

But, that's the Nob Hill pattern: Check it out yourself: Hiway House. Zia Lodge. Irreplaceable. The stories continue to mount. Typical: Empty lots with dark, Vintage Neon signs. True: Vintage businesses don't just close, they *disappear, along with the culture they embodied*. Rising rents. Declining customers. Changing demographics. Blight.

Some say it was/is: A neighborhood pride that died, or stopped fighting for the spaces and places that made it distinctive.

Toddle House… Vacant… Farmacy… Vacant. What’s to come: Darkness. Vacancy for sure? Blight? It might! Each successive transition erased/erases a little more of what once made Central Avenue, Nob Hill, this precious stretch of Main Street actually, permanently interesting. 

Neon! Nightlife. This isn't nostalgia waxing, this is a chronicle of fatal disintegration... in real time. (Sadly: This here writing is only documentation of a complete Diner-extinction Event... all along the Fabled 18 Miles in the Duke City… and it's now in progress.)

# Vintage HR 66 Diners: Seven Clover

**Hey! Remember When Nob Hill Had Diners?**

Seven Clover: ""For Rent"" Says Everything!

Seven Clover Diner closed forever about 1997. What replaced it? Nothing! The ""FOR RENT"" sign tells you it's probably not coming back.

Another Nob Hill Vintage 50’s-60s Diner, gone. No dramatic story. No Nob Hill community rallying campaign to save it. No independent protest. Just quiet, grinding, economic pressure, gradual Era erosion. Change. Neglect. Time. And a neighborhood that couldn't—or wouldn't—keep it alive. Remember? I do.

And mark you: Seven Clover wasn't some big national chain. It was more a one-off, local Neighborhood Hub with character, history, honest-homey: The kind of place that separates a real neighborhood, from a themed retail district. 

Now: Seven Clover Diner is just another vacant storefront on Central, waiting, along with other vacant memories, wanting for whatever comes next. Nothingness? Blight?

A Requiem for Diners: Toddle House. Farmacy. Seven Clover. 

The Last Picture Show? There’s one left in Nob Hill: The Valentine Diner. It’s sitting, unused, and forgotten in Triangle Park.

January 2026: In sum: The exact number of current, operating Vintage 40s, 50s, 60s Diners in Nob Hill: Exactly Zero!

What happened? Demise was not sudden! But: Loss was inevitable, if not cast in stone? When did we, Albuquerque, decide this attrition was acceptable?

# Vintage HR 66 Diner: The Valentine Diner

**Hey! Remember When Nob Hill Had Diners?**

History Repeats! Say! The Valentine Diner Deserves Better Than That! Give it what it has already earned: Recognition! Preservation! Renovation!

RIGHT NOW: The last of its breed: For Sale or Rent: 1945 vintage, Valentine Diner car sitting, waiting in Nob Hill, Triangle Park *right now*. Empty! Sullen! If it only could: It would be pondering its own fate. Hoping for a New Buyer! A real new Lease on Life!

Waiting for someone or something to rescue it from oblivion! 

Thumbnail History:

The Valentine as a Neighborhood Diner/Hub was always only in the Duke City since 1947. About 1995, during HR 66 road construction, it was moved from 8th and Central. As I understand: CABQ acquired it.

I'm guessing: History repeats: 

1995: The Valentine Diner was probably moved with the usual civic promises: A New Life: Restoration, a new coat of paint: Respect, reuse on the Nob Hill! 

2030: The Valentine Diner was probably moved with the usual civic promises: A New Life: Restoration, respect, reuse on the Westside, 66 Tourist Center, returning it to its original purpose. A new coat of paint! 

2026: Sorry to say: Instead, today, it's only a prop, a cute little toy-box. The Reality? It’s only a political football in danger of getting kicked down Route 66, perhaps All the Way Down… and out of Town!

Friends! This isn't so much about timely preservation—it's either Rescue with care, or Abandonment with malice.

January 2026: Here's what makes matters worse: The Route 66 Centennial is happening NOW. We have: Historical and Cultural Focus. Maximum leverage opportunity. National attention, perhaps. Spotlight? Limelight? 

No! We have: Dark Neon! And Albuquerque, City of, can't even follow through on preserving its most… essential, warming, welcoming, comforting, symbolic piece of Mother Road history: The Valentine Diner! 

Shame! Politics. Apathy. Neglect. Blight. What do they say? ""A Nation that cannot remember its history, is doomed to repeat it's past errors...."" 

It's Late! But Not Too Late: Support Our Route 66 Legacy:

Join Us: Valentine's Day 2026 Photo OP Event. Free Post Cards. Photo ops. Nob Hill, Triangle Park. 2-4 PM!

I came in around 11.30 am and was working quietly when at about 1.30pm, a server asked me to move to an uncomfortable corner. I was weirded out because I was the only one who was asked to do so, when there were other people who stayed there longer than I was. Well they were foreigners so that could be the main reason I was singled out.

I was about to consider moving when a lady from the management (or the gf of the owner or smth) came to me and again told me to move to this really out of the way,almost broken down chair. I tried to explain my situation but she didn’t listen and didn’t care. She kept on saying that she “let” me stay the whole day yesterday, like I wasn’t paying for the food and drinks the whole time. Mind you this isn’t a cheap place. It’s a place where you pay a lot to get bland food.

So it appeared she was mad at me for staying there the whole day yesterday and taking that anger out on me now?

Anyway she also told this is a brunch place and asked me “are you paying to stay for the whole day?” which was diabolical. It’s not a guest house she is running that has to be paid on an hourly basis or something.

I told her that this was unprofessional and she called me unprofessional back

I was shocked and disgusted at this point. I was singled out and attacked.

She left mid-convo without any apology. My work was disrupted and I felt really low. I paid and left.

Another server came again and asked me to move and agreed that she doesn’t know how to speak.

It’s surprising to me how these kind of people run businesses. Again the problem isn’t them asking me to move, it’s the WAY they did it, like they couldn’t wait to get rid of me. If they explained their situation and asked me to move politely, nothing would have happened.

It ruined my whole day and I have never been treated so poorly by a restaurant.

It’s disheartening that locals are treated unfairly, while foreigners are welcomed for their money",1,1769227666.0,u_ThrowRAyappadappa,2,1.0,False
1qlcsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/1qlcsci/access_restored_or_not_arbitration_time/,Access restored... or not? Arbitration time?,"I'm between jobs and want to drive for Uber. Don't have a car currently so I decided to rent through Hertz. That process has been fine. But I'm having significant issues going online that feel like deceptive trade practices. 

  
It started the first time I rented, the week of Christmas. The app said I was eligible to rent, so I dropped the cash on a the Hertz rental and picked up with no issue. But when I tried to log on, I received an error that I needed to resubmit my background check. So I tried, but never got confirmation it was processing and it wasn't showing up on Checkr. I called support, they spent several days ""investigating"" and said I had a ""duplicate account"" and told me I needed to access my account from the other email that was listed. Mind you, I've had a driver account with my actual email for 9+ years. 

They escalated to their internal review team which ended up taking 10+ days. Didn't get to do one ride, had to return the rental, made zero money. I finally got a call from support that my account issue had been resolved (apparently some kind of identity theft) and I was approved to drive again.

I decided to try again today. Same process — reserved rental, went to pick up, everything was fine. Once the vehicle was added to my account, I got a support message that my access had been restored. Great, I thought. I hit Go Online. ""Resolve Issues Before Going Online"" box appears. I click Learn More. ""This account is blocked. Contact Support if you think this is wrong.""

So, I called support. The tech put me on hold. Came back on the line and said ""I'm going to send this over to our internal review team now as they will need to take a look,"" which sounded like I was being transferred via phone. Nope, ""Thanks for calling Uber, have a great day"" and they hung up. I tried to call support back from my number and received a ""We are no longer taking calls at this number"" message. I called from my second phone line and was prompted to enter my phone number to connect to an agent. I did, then got the same BS ""We are not taking calls at this number"" message. Messaged support via chat. ""You already have a ticket open so to avoid confusion we must close this ticket.""

Now I'm \*again\* sitting on a rental that I can't make money with until their internal team reviews my account, which conceivably won't happen until next week, by which point I probably won't be able to met the 30 ride quota and will have to return the rental, giving zero rides and making zero cash. Again. 

I'm seriously considering arbitration for deceptive trade practices. How are you going to allow me to rent a car through your partner program — which any reasonable person would think indicates approval to drive — only to pull the rug out from under me? Why does my account say ""Ready to Drive"" only to say my account is blocked after I hit Go Online, even after I was told on the phone by support that my account was good to go and I have a support message saying as much? 

I'm interviewing for a full-time job but no guarantee I'd get it, and it wouldn't start until late Feb/early March anyway. I need a side job, and the market is terrible right now. I couldn't even get hired at a local coffee shop. What gives? Any tips? Thanks for reading through this if you got this far.",1,1769227563.0,uberdrivers,1,1.0,False

""I’m not sure if you expected more money from me to buy frames (\*a christmas gift she planned to order me after we left). But if you did I’m using that money to get a cleaning girl to clean the mess you left for me both in my condo and in my car. Not trying to be confrontational just telling it like it is. Hope you’re enjoying your trip.""

However, we did not leave a mess. We took out the garbage, emptied the dishwasher, cleaned the fridge and everything was tidied up. We did not do the laundry which included bedding and towels. Her car did have sand in it since we went to the beach multiple days (with her too). She originally said I had to take the car somewhere to get cleaned but one of the last days said she would deal with it.

On top of that, my mother-in-law also visited (took a plane from NJ to FL). She got in at 10 pm christmas eve after working all day and was leaving the day after christmas. The plan was that we would take my mom's car to the car rental facility the morning after christmas as we were driving to the next part of our trip and since my mom would be staying at her boyfriend's house down the street, she would meet us there to pick up her car. But she ""forgot"" the plan and ultimately when my mother-in-law offered to drive us instead, my mom said ok- even though my MIL was visiting for only 1.5 days and had planned to go to the beach before her evening flight.

Anyway, I have been distant from my mom since because I'm sick of ​the way she acts frankly. But when she asked me why i haven't been answering her texts I told her I was taking space because of the above experiences. She blamed me ​for giving her bursitis in her arm because she had to do ""8 loads of laundry for the bed alone"", had to clean the sand out of her car as well as a coffee stain on her leather seat apparently, and I assume she had to vacuum. I just wanted to get people's feedback about this. Is it normal to expect your daughter to do the laundry, vacuum, vacuum the car while visiting with a 1 year old? Not to mention, my husband and I were both working while down there, my husband made all of our meals for us which she also ate, and he fixed a few miscellaneous things in her condo for her. My mom's retired. We were leaving the morning after Christmas to drive to the next spot we were visiting which was 5 hours away- with our 1 year old. I don't know how we would have even been able to do any more cleaning before we left.

• Bomi is not as twinky as I would have thought him to be


• Three episodes in and no scenes with Kazuyuki
I guess for the drama in not doing but I would have had Kazuyuki be lead coffee guy on Day 2 and had him make his selection


• Wouldn't Huwei and Izaya make a good couple on account they seem mentally equal regarding their approach to relationships?


• Hiroya is a good, bold, and perhaps might pair well with Kazuyuki


• For my tastes, I ❤️ Bomi and 😍 Huwei for myself

i was told by my sleep doctor(neurologist i believe?) that until my sleep study (5 weeks frorm now) i should not take naps during the day until my study. the study hasn't even been scheduled yet, should be 5-6 weeks from now.

. i need to fix my sleep schedule. i was sleeping midnight to noon or as late as 3 pm. she is haing me sleep this week from 10:30pn-11:30am i think? and reducing each hour by one   until i can sleep when i'm supposed to at the study.

she wants me to drink coffee in the morning and melatonin at night 1-2mg

my problem is im not making sense and i keep having times during the day where it seems like i am worse off than when i was sleeping a lot and taking a couple naps

i am supposed to stop the coffee and melationin 2 weeks before the study

i am scared im going crazy because i think my sleep is worse. i also almost said a bad word today(like REALLY bad, not like a swear word like 'fuck'but a worse word)  that i've never said in my whole life because i was telling a story to someone and i think i fell asleep during it? or almost did?

i keep feeling like im dozing off in conversations. it feels like it's getting a lot worse since i've started this new schedule where i can't take naps during the day and where i have specific times i need to sleep. isn't it supposed to be easier?

im scared that this may be a sign of something psychological because i can't even stay awake until 10:30 but i literally have to because that's what my doctor wants me to schedule

if it's something psychological would going to the doctor help? like the one where you stay over 3 nights and they give you psych meds. i went there once when i wanted to die but that was man ymoons ago. i am scared because i only have hypnogognanic hallucinations at night time but if it's narcoleptic then i'm supposed to stop when i'm on the sleep schedule right? well i am still getting them before i fall asleep.

please help me if possible. did anyone else feel this way? or have a similar experience?

1qlcoqf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qlcoqf,Ben & Jerry’s review: great job with these classics! 8.5/10 all around,"So this is a late review: tried these in the beginning of December. Will try my best to remember!

\##Scoop-a-palooza Strawberries & Cream

So I had a coupon from Ben & Jerry’s because of an issue with an ice cream I had. The coupon was pretty generous—it allowed for getting this large size Scoop-a-palooza ice cream (or alternatively the pints) too which was rad. This is the only large size I’ve tried from them. 

\* Sweet cream ice cream - for some reason i was expecting pink ice cream. Maybe the ice cream is more white color than the picture. Anyway the flavor is between sweet cream and strawberry, I think because of the potent flavor infusion of the strawberry swirls. Very pleasant, nice natural taste. Not as strawberry tasting as actual strawberry ice cream such as by Haagen Dazs. But very smooth, rich, creamy—great consistency. I wondered if the larger sizes would cheap out, but no it’s still quality ice cream. 

\* Strawberry swirls - this is a candied strawberry jam flavor. Reminds me of like the strawberry syrup you get with a cheesecake at a decent restaurant. Maybe similar to the candied taste of the strawberries in Private Selection New York Style Strawberry Cheesecake. 

\*\*RATING: 8.5/10. The milder taste of the sweet cream ice cream with the stronger syrupy taste of the strawberry swirls makes a very good balance that tastes sophisticated. Reminds me of like the way plain cheesecake tastes great with strawberry syrup, without the cheesecake flavor (but some of the rich quality). I’m not running to get this one again, but I would bring it to a party. Good balance, good value. I think the strawberry swirls is nicely done in that it tastes sugary but not artificial.  

\##Coffee, Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz

Honestly I was surprised to see this in stores as I thought it was discontinued and only a Ben and Jerry’s scoop shop flavor. I got it at just a regular Harris Teeter (Kroger affiliated). I loved Ben and Jerry’s limited edition discontinued flavor Change is Brewing, also a coffee flavor. And wanted to see if this measured up. 

\* Coffee ice cream - a very nice, more intense coffee flavor, shot of espresso. I don’t know how it compares to Change is Brewing. I think it’s probably similar though I just have a memory of enjoying Change is Brewing more, which was a cold brew coffee flavor with some coffee grinds. 

\* Espresso bean fudge chunks - these are huge! But also thin, so they are not hard to chew (for reference the fudge chunks in B&J Chunky Monkey is much thicker and harder to chew). The combination of large and thin was enjoyable actually. And wow there was a lot of chocolate chips. The flavor and texture wasn’t the usual Ben and Jerry’s chocolate chip flavor. It was indeed espresso flavor, with a gritty texture also like frozen coffee grounds mixed in. I rather enjoyed the darker flavor with a twist of concentrated coffee. 

\*\*RATING: 8.5/10. This is a simple ice cream with bold flavors and lots of crunch. Yeah it’s a good one to try. I’ve had similar ice cream before, but Ben and Jerry’s does it better with more coffee flavor, more chocolate chips, and the unique espresso flavor of the chocolate chips. 

\##Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough

To be honest I’ve tried many many Ben and Jerry’s in the last two years. And this one was about the bottom of my list to try as the flavor sounded so ordinary. But I believe actually Ben and Jerry’s did cookie dough ice cream first didn’t they? Well, they did a solid job. I can see why it’s a favorite. 

\* Vanilla ice cream - Ben and Jerry’s does a really nice vanilla actually, very concentrated milk fat. This one i think I remember is more buttery than Ben and Jerry’s usual vanilla flavor, like the kind that usually accompanies cookie dough ice cream that we now know. Anyway it was very rich and pleasant to eat. 

\* Gobs of cookie dough - wow so much cookie dough. Definitely the max amount of cookie dough in a pint I’ve had. Larger size cookie dough than many. Chewy. Nom nom. Mmm. 

\* Chocolate chips - standard size, standard flavor from B&J (you can see how much larger the ones in Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz is). A nice crunchy accompaniment to the chewy cookie dough 

\*\*RATING: 8.5/10. Super satisfying to eat. Classic flavors, but just better all around. More flavor, more mix ins. Even the base ice cream is something to write about. 

\##Overall

Yeah I enjoyed each of these. Same rating as I liked all, and it’s been a while so I forgot which I liked best. But I think these are all classic flavors done right with attention to each component. I’m not sure I walked away with a new favorite. Except if I’m craving cookie dough, yeah I probably would check out Ben and Jerry’s. Funny how I ignored it for so long!

1qlcn6l,https://i.redd.it/g2jcjann08fg1.jpeg,I'm blown away,"I never thought decaf could be this good. I've been trying to experiment with as many new light roast decafs as possible with the goal of finding that perfect one that fits my palate. I've found quite a few decent ones that I would go back to but never one that blew me away. This is that decaf.

I'm on day 2 brewing this bag 8 days off roast and it just sings. It has really nice acidity, with mild sour fruit notes (strawberry and citrus) that just dance on your tongue then goes into a nice silky body and clean finish. Zero funk. Zero bitter decaf notes. I've tried a few leaded pink bourbons lately and I would never guess this was decaf. If you like fruit forward coffee with a smooth body you gotta try this one!

I’m 26M and moved to BC from Nova Scotia a while ago. I have a fairly international background, born in South Asia, grew up in Brunei Darussalam (a small country beside Malaysia), and have lived in a few different places including the US.

I’m looking for friends who enjoy deep conversations rather than clubbing. I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs, so I prefer wholesome hangouts over the party scene. I really value genuine connections and surrounding myself with positive, supportive people.

**Some things I’m into:**

* **Psychology:** I love reading about human behavior and discussing psychology books.
* **Arts:** Big fan of theatre, Opera, museums, and galleries.
* **Photography:** I’ve just started getting into photography and am planning to pick up the new Fujifilm X-T30 III with the 13-33mm lens soon to explore the city and nature.
* **Exploration:** I love travelling and finding new spots around Vancouver.

If you are looking for a friend to grab a coffee, go for a photo walk, or catch a show with, shoot me a DM here on Reddit!

I told my (38M) Husband that he was an asshole for telling me (37F) that I didn't care about him?,"(I created this account for this post specifically because I don't want to post this on my main and the name on my profile is fake btw)

Now I KNOW I'm not overreacting in this situation, but I just need to get this off my chest. So, I'm a big girl's girl and I have been since I was young but apparently my husband doesn't understand girl friendships. So basically, me and my friend (35F) Jasmine (an open lesbian which will be important later) were hanging out at a coffee shop just catching up since she left on vacation a couple weeks ago. and she mentioned that she's been on a couple dates with a new girl that she really likes. I didn't think much of this as it is normal for jasmine to go on dates every so often, but apparently, it meant a LOT to my husband. Well, when I got back home, I started doing chores as normal when my husband walked in back from work. I was doing laundry at this time, and he greeted me as normal and asked, ""how was your little coffee date with Jasmine?"" ""It was refreshing to see her after so long! and she said she started going on dates with someone she likes!"" My husband made a weird face as if he was trying to process what I just said. He asked me to repeat what I just said in a more irritated tone. I said again, ""It was refreshing to see her after so long? and she said she started going on dates with someone she likes?"" I'm started to get confused now wondering why this seems important to him. ""And you don't see a problem with this?"" he said as if he was hinting at me to confess myself. ""No? Why would I?"" I say back. ""Um don't you think that's a little too personal to be sharing?"" He's starting to get more worked up and I can sense that he's going to blow up and try calming him down. ""It's not too personal for our friendship at least. And you never seem upset when I mention my other friends going on dates."" ""Well, that's different because they are going on dates with guys!"" I look at him hurt. I've always been an ally, and I thought my husband was too. And even though he's been to the protests and openly told me he supports the LGBTQ+ community this is something I never suspected of him saying. ""Are you serious? Do you really think that?"" I can see by his face that he realized. He fucked up. ""That shouldn't matter."" I wait for him to apologize or say anything really, but I'm assuming you can guess what he does. he just walks past me and up into our bedroom. Giving me the silent treatment like I was in the wrong somehow???? a day passes and he's still not talking to me except just basic ""excuse me"", ""hello"", ""goodbye"", etc. I eventually just start screaming at him because I'm so fucking mad. ""You can seriously not be this childish! I am not in the wrong here! You're the one who said something fucked up and didn't even say sorry! And now you're giving ME the silent treatment making ME sleep on the couch! You're being an asshole!"" My husband looks at me in frustration. Without saying a word, he goes upstairs, packs a bag, and walks out the door. I'm still stunned at the fact he would do something like this. Me and my husband have NEVER had a situation like this before, and our relationship is usually healthy. Like 30 minutes after this happened, he sent me a text. I will copy and paste it here: ""Hey Babe Sorry tha i wasnt talking to you but I feel like you are overreacting about be being an asshole. i just need som time to process this. so, i'm driving up to my mom's to sta there for a couple of days"" This is so fucking crazy to me because again my husband has never acted like this and I probably wouldn't be able to spot this in 1000 years. I texted Jasmine and told her what happened. She was really sympathetic and offered for me to come over to talk about it, but I declined and just stayed in my room and cried. I know my Husband is the asshole in this but i am seriously rethinking our years together on this. So, tell me reddit am I overreacting.",1,1769227064.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

Do you think dreams have meaning Psychologically on what happens to our brain?

So here it goes:

I dreamed that I was on a boat ride with a couple. There were five of us on a white boat. I was taking to a lady while we are sitting in the yacht above enjoying the view. And then I found out through my travel papers that I am vacationing on Switzerland at Grindelwald specifically. Lol

I felt happy and surreal when I became aware of where I was. It looked like we were riding on a yacht in a calm sea and sunny weather.

Suddenly, the scene changed and I was riding a go-kart on the road. There was a big transparent bubble around me that protected me and supported the vehicle incase I bumped to something, I will just bounce off. Then I had an accident. I hit a wall the it goes through and crashed near a tourist coffee shop. I accidentally spilled a young guy’s coffee, a bit same of my age.

At first, I thought he would be angry, but he wasn’t. 

The guy looks angry since he has that resting b\*ch face but when he saw me apologizing he said it was okay and then smiled at me warmly.

He just smiled at me. I gave him tissues and wet wipes, and I bowed slightly while apologizing like what you see in japanese people how they bowed haha. He thanked me kindly.

After I left the coffee shop, I realized that my Go Kart bike had been stolen. I felt worried, but the coffee shop lady owners helped me.

Or do you just really, really love hard candy? Struggling with dry mouth but find products too expensive to just try it and see if it helps? Today's your lucky day! To celebrate finally being able to progress to soup, I'm giving away some stuff that I either didn't like enough to keep it now that I can have real food, things that didn't work for me, or stuff I have an absolute ton of. I'm willing to split it up a little bit, but the stuff in the Ziploc baggie is all going together because I'm not willing to pick it apart. I've got: 

\- Ziploc baggie containing some dumdums in a few flavors; mostly grape and watermelon yum earth pops with a few extras thrown in for variety; a handful of mini chupchup lollipops; some sour apple caramel lollipops

\- open or unopened bags of: sour salty lime candy x3; 'super sour' chupchups that gave me heartburn; werther's coffee caramel x2; a Japanese peach candy that we don't think tastes like anything but maybe you will; a Japanese milk candy that isn't bad but isn't as good as the other six bags I've got; a spiced chai flavored candy

\- a bag of sugar free werthers, unopened, that I bought on accident while still drugged up and am not motivated enough to try to return

\- a pack of dry mouth lozenges, unused but open; a bottle of Biotene rinse, used once by pouring into a cup; and a tube of biotene gel, used once by putting it on a spoon (so no mouth contact with any open products). these all work ok at creating spit (well, I didn't try the lozenges, but I'm sure they work just as well) but unfortunately something about them upsets my stomach to the point where I didn't want to risk the lozenges. I know this is sort of a niche giveaway but I also know stuff like this can get expensive quickly so if you don't mind it being open, this is close to $20 of free dry mouth treatment stuff

---

### The Quiet Power of Coloring for Adults 🧘‍♀️🎨  

Funny how life comes full circle.  
As kids, we saw coloring as play — now, as adults, it feels like therapy disguised as nostalgia.  

I first picked up an adult coloring page on a rare Sunday off. Papers everywhere, coffee ring on the desk, brain completely fried. Five minutes in, I realized… I wasn’t thinking about emails, bills, or tomorrow.  
Just color, space, and the quiet rhythm of my hand.  

It’s wild how something so simple trains mindfulness better than half the “productivity hacks” out there.  
Coloring helps you unplug, focus, and breathe again. Sometimes we just need that — a small, intentional escape.  

So, I put together a calming **Adult Coloring Book PDF** — filled with designs that invite you to slow down, refocus, and rediscover your creativity. No pressure, no perfection, just presence.  

Before I share it, here’s what people have been loving about coloring therapy lately:

*How to Look Busy, Avoid Work, and Survive the Day Without Actually Doing Much*



# Section 1: Weapons of Delay

These are your core tools for stretching tasks indefinitely without anyone noticing.

* **Ask for details… endlessly.** Every assignment is unclear until you make it so. Ask questions repeatedly, request clarifications, and subtly suggest your “method” might be superior.
* **Stretch deadlines invisibly.** Break tasks into tiny steps, prioritize imaginary dependencies, or pretend something outside your control must happen first.
* **The “almost-there” finish.** Deliver work that is slightly incomplete or off-target. People will follow up, and you get to pass the buck in small installments.



# Section 2: Social Loopholes

Humans are surprisingly easy to manipulate—stand close, smile, and confuse them.

* **Interrupt strategically.** If someone starts a conversation, hijack it with boring but plausible topics: the weather, office coffee, paperclips, or printer issues.
* **Physical dominance by proximity.** Stand close while talking. Bonus if your clothes are slightly messy or your hygiene is off—it discourages people from asking too much.
* **Feign listening.** Nod, smile, and occasionally mutter agreement while mentally plotting how to avoid actual effort.



# Section 3: Task Selection Tactics

Not all work is created equal. Choose wisely.

* **Volunteer for the unwanted jobs.** Nobody notices if you take your time on a task nobody wanted anyway. Slow pace = low expectations.
* **Avoid high-interest tasks.** Fun or engaging work leads to effort, and effort is forbidden.
* **Delegate without appearing lazy.** Suggest others might be “better suited” for a task, planting the idea while keeping your hands clean.



# Section 4: Appearance of Productivity

Looking busy is often as good as being busy.

* **Shuffle papers, type random emails.** Keep devices open and make frequent notes. People will assume work is happening.
* **Open multiple tabs.** Nothing says “focused” like a screen full of irrelevant windows.
* **The “random check-in.”** Walk past coworkers or drop by meetings for a few minutes to show presence, then retreat before any real work starts.



# Section 5: Avoiding the Engagement Trap

Some things are dangerous: enjoyment, friends, and enthusiasm.

* **Avoid genuine investment.** If a task or conversation becomes fun, step away. Fun leads to work. Work leads to exhaustion. Avoid at all costs.
* **Friends are liability.** Helping friends leads to extra effort. Keep social energy minimal; nod politely, smile, but never overcommit.



# Section 6: Advanced Procrastination Tactics

* **The Loop of Confusion.** Repeatedly clarify instructions, ask for updates, or question priorities. Confusion = delay.
* **Overcomplicate needlessly.** Propose alternative methods, optional steps, or “better ways” to slow progress while seeming insightful.
* **Invisible deadlines.** Pretend timelines exist in some abstract “future” where your contribution is critical but currently untraceable.



# Final Rule:

Appear helpful, stay optional, and remember: every delay is a victory. Efficiency is the enemy. Engagement is the enemy. Real work is the enemy.",0,1769226270.0,mildlyinfuriating,2,0.5,False

I’d really like to hear about other people’s experiences leaving a relationship where “nothing terrible happened,” but it still ended.

I was with my ex-boyfriend for one year. After three months of dating, we decided to move in together. It was very rushed, I know. We were both 21 and didn’t think it through too much. The first months of our relationship were wonderful. He was the first man who truly treated me with care: he made me feel like a princess, unique, beautiful, and deeply loved. He was very attentive to everything I said and did, very thoughtful, proud to show me off, and he didn’t even follow other women on social media. He always tried to please me. He used to say he wanted to become a millionaire so I would only have to worry about going out for coffee with my friends. I was completely in love, especially because my previous relationships had been really bad.

When we moved in together, many things stayed the same, but constant arguments started over absurd things: the color of a cleaning rag, the result of a simple math problem, really silly stuff. The issue wasn’t the arguments themselves, but the fact that they happened every day and were never resolved. He would keep arguing until I agreed with him or left the room. Then we would just act like nothing happened. Time would pass, and he would come back with flowers or food, without ever talking about what had happened.

I have depression, anxiety, and BPD, and I’ve been in treatment for four years. At first, he supported me and was there during my crises, but over time he started to get annoyed when I was depressed. He said my sadness affected him and that I should “cheer up.” He also has depression and takes medication, but he always acted as if nothing was wrong with him.

After about four months of living together, the house became a mess. I cleaned, and we took turns cooking. He worked, and I was studying (and still am). But every time I cleaned, everything would be dirty again within minutes. Just using the bathroom or serving himself food turned into a disaster. When I asked him to help keep things tidy, he got upset and said I was messy too. Little by little, I became more depressed and stopped cleaning. He didn’t clean or throw away his trash at all: eggshells on the floor, food everywhere, piles of dirty dishes. The house—especially the bathroom and kitchen—became unbearable, and seeing it like that made me feel terrible.

Despite all this, we also had very good moments. We laughed together for hours, shared inside jokes only we understood. He was very sweet with me, and I never felt ashamed of being myself around him. He was my best friend, and I was his.

He remained thoughtful, but he was constantly frustrated about money. Even though he earned a decent salary, he was a compulsive spender: as soon as he got paid, he wanted to spend everything on going out, fast food, unnecessary Amazon purchases, or very expensive sneakers. I tried to talk to him about saving and being more organized, but he said it was pointless to work so much and not enjoy his money.

There was almost never food in the house. Many times, I went hungry. When I told him, he got angry and said he didn’t have money and that I shouldn’t complain. Once, I had to practically beg him just to go buy drinking water. Whenever we talked about money, he became very rude to me. I would lock myself in the bathroom crying, and hours later he would come back with a gift and an apology.

I tried to leave the relationship several times because I felt increasingly exhausted and worn down. The daily micro-arguments drained me. I hated coming back home from school because I knew the house would be just as bad or worse. I even heard him say that I was to blame for his bad habits, that he wasn’t messy or dirty, but that my depression had made him that way.

He constantly complained about the government, his job, and money. He compared himself to others and got angry that some people had new cars or were rich. He said he hated living like this and wanted to be rich so he wouldn’t have to do anything and could have everything. However, around other people, he bragged about having a perfect life: a house, a partner, a car, a great job, a “wonderful life.” He also made very egocentric comments that hurt me, although afterward he would apologize.

Because of all this, and because it became impossible to maintain a minimally clean and emotionally healthy home, I decided to end the relationship for my mental well-being and move back in with my parents. I had tried before, but this time I didn’t change my decision. He accepted it. We cried a lot. We had one last date—food, coffee, and a movie, just like our first date—and then he helped me pack. We talked about good memories, cried, laughed, and hugged. The next day, he drove me to my parents’ house, crying the entire way. When we said goodbye, he apologized for not being good enough. I told him there was nothing to forgive.

Tomorrow marks two weeks since the breakup. I haven’t heard from him, and it hurts so much. I miss him deeply: his daily calls, his surprise notes, his hugs, his kisses on my forehead, feeling loved and protected. I can’t stop thinking that no one will ever love me the way he did, that there’s no other man like him—protective, provider, thoughtful, gentlemanly. It hurts to think that I may have ruined the best relationship of my life, and that if we had never moved in together, we might still be happy today.

I don’t know what to do with these thoughts. I’m scared they might be true. Please be kind; I just needed to vent. I’m very sad.",1,1769225717.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False
1qlc4z8,https://i.redd.it/ch93m9y5r7fg1.png,Boss Relic Tier List with Explanations,"# S TIER

Black Star & Slaver's Collar: Putting these two together because they fulfill the same purpose, making your build stronger by hunting down the most valuable enemies in the Spire. You should already be maxing elites anyway, this makes that task easier. Slaver's is also the only energy relic that has no downside, it'll always be active in your most important heists.

Sozu: The best energy relic because potions are never going to save your run after Act 1; you could pull a clutch Block Potion on something like a Gremlin Nob, but there's nothing they can do that couldn't already be accomplished by a well-made deck.

Busted Crown & Philosopher's Stone: Putting these two together because they're generally amazing picks but can really bite you in certain situations. If your deck isn't already good and you get Crown as your Act 2- or, even worse, Act 1- relic then you can actually get fucked over as you just have no good cards to choose from, but that's more of a luck issue. Philosopher's is generally going to be free energy but some fights (most notably the birds, those damned birds, though also most enemies with minions and some Act 3 enemies such as Tar or Automatons) will really bite you, so be wary if your deck doesn't have enough block.

Tiny House: Free shit, the heal is good on high ascensions, not much to say.

Black Blood & Serpent Ring: Putting these together because they're straight upgrades for their respective characters, they're very rare but so good.

# A TIER

Calling Bell: Can make your build, or at least improve it, and all it takes is one curse which you can always find some way to navigate. Some of the relic pulls you'll see are diabolical. Gatekept from S tier because it does, of course, come with a curse, and there's no guarantee that you'll pull excellent relics- again, a luck issue.

Ectoplasm: Shops are generally not necessary, so if you're fine routing around them then yes, lacking gold is no issue. But you do miss out on some important events, and getting a good shop inventory can make your build, so it's a pretty big risk for one energy- but that energy is so, so precious.

Nuclear Battery: Free energy for Defect, and a good way to start their deck cycle. Gatekept from S because it simply doesn't do a lot, it's just one plasma orb.

Wrist Blade: Shivs and Slice having an extra 4 base damage is insane in Act 2 but it falls off pretty hard, especially given how stacked Silent's cards are on the whole. Not useful enough for S but definitely A tier.

# B TIER

Coffee Dripper: The true patrician's choice. I never have the balls to go for this, but it's technically a straight upgrade since damage is, on the whole, relatively avoidable. You WILL get bitten by this relic at least once, you'll run into a luck issue and take 40 damage that you can't rest off, but overall it's a good way to get energy, a great B tier.

Cursed Key: If you get this in Act 2 you're set for life, you only have 1 more chest guaranteed and you can even work around the curse you get, or just block it with Omamori. That being said, if you get it BEFORE Act 2, you can quickly snowball into being filled with cursed cards, constantly pulling shit like Pain and Decay.

Sacred Bark: It has no downside, but refer to the previous point about potions. There's no harm in grabbing it, it can make some potions absolutely clutch, and it's the key to a gimmicky potion build with stuff like White Beast Statue and Alchemize, but.. c'mon. Potions.

Mark of Pain: This would suck on most decks, but Ironclad has no problem exhausting cards. We once again run into a luck issue as you'll inevitably draw something like Defend, Defend, Wound, Wound, all while the enemy's preparing some massive attack. Useful most times, but not useful enough for A tier.

Runic Cube: This actually DOES have a downside, as taking unwanted damage can destroy your hand and completely fuck up your cycle. Ironclad especially hates this because he, overall, has a lot of high-energy cards that he won't be able to play, which will then go to Discard because they got drawn by this fucking cube. Still, card draw is good, Ironclad is uniquely qualified to use it, and it has no (obvious) downside.

# C TIER

Astrolabe: Complete luck, you can turn 3 junk cards into god pulls or turn some strikes and defends into.. even worse than strikes and defends. You can do better than this.

Empty Cage: You could optimize your deck a little, remove some curse cards, or pick a better relic.

Runic Dome: This is, in theory, a straight upgrade. It however means that you've memorized every enemy's attack pattern down to the exact turn, and accounted for potential changes in those patterns. If you're already winning then you can use the extra energy, but if you actually need to try, then this can definitely screw you over.

Velvet Choker: This relic draws the most ire. 6 cards is abysmally restrictive, but that extra energy is precious, and I could see a build where.. maybe? Like, Ironclad and Defect have some high-energy heavy-hitters that don't necessarily need a lot of cards to use, but still- only SIX. Extremely dubious relic that'll constantly restrict you, but it's for a very precious upside.

Frozen Core: Ice orbs are not good, Defect has better ways to gain block, if you want ice then use Chill and Cool-headed. Technically it's an upgrade because more orbs are better, but Defect really doesn't need this.

Hovering Kite: Really cool, no real downsides, it's only 1 energy per turn in exchange for a discard. Concentrate is a blue-tier card and it does this but better. Good for some builds, it'll clutch like once and that's it.

Insertor: More orb slots is technically an upgrade, but one every 2 turns is very meh. It stands out as being one of only 2 ways to gain orb slots, the other one being a power, Capacitor.

# F TIER

These relics are either completely useless or actively detrimental, it would genuinely be better to skip them. Viewer beware.

Fusion Hammer: Actively detrimental. Smithing is god tier, you should only take this if you have the Warped Tongs or Bottled Apotheosis, and finding those alongside this is pretty rare.

Pandora's Box: Complete luck issue, you will take this because everyone on reddit said it'd be funny and then get a build that literally can't block. It'd be fine if it transformed some cards, it'd be an interesting choice, but you don't even have the safety net of basic Strike damage and Defend block. Hate this thing.

Runic Pyramid: Actively detrimental, when are you using 100% of the cards that go through your hand. Notably, everyone has SOME way to use this: Seeing Red, Concentrate, TURBO, and of course Watcher. But you're gonna need a seriously fucked-up evil deck to get value out of this evil pyramid.

Snecko Eye: Another reddit relic, another luck issue. You will get a hand full of 3-energy cards and you will like it.

The last two relics on this list are both exclusive to Watcher and they're perfectly meh, I can't even be bothered to remember their names because they do so little for a character that's already very stacked. I suppose weak relics for a strong character is fair.",0,1769225663.0,slaythespire,10,0.18,False

Squinted had been the look upon the boy's face, Gruff had been the words the boy managed to muster. ""I ain't buyin' it.""

Both left motionless, Both left to stare. For how blank had been Mr. Rabbit's expression. To stare from those oval patches of stitched on cotton. For how scrunched up would remain the boy's attempt at using The Detective's scary face. Silent would this moment be, had it not been for the wet slapping of meat from that thing tangled in the other seat.

The stink of that shedding meat, That came from an endless chain of joints left twisting, and popping. Gurgling, Slurping of the pool of crimson, that now looked to flow in the direction it once came. The sound of slapping meat being pressed back upon the very thing that shed such things. Yet amongst all these noises, Jack dare not look, For he knew once he did such a silly thing, Mr. Rabbit would come out to play.

Knew not just the mistake the boy was about to make. For that radio to yell out from it's sleep with all it's might, *RUN!!!* A shame it had come to late, For all it served was to draw away the boy's gaze. For this radio now became the only place the boy had left to stare. Left to listen to the popping of stitches that now came beyond his open window. Of the gruesome sounds of the thing within now stirring, Of that sludge that would be all consuming. Sludge from which tendrils had been left to give the boy a not so friendly wave.

Low hanging fruit, Jack had been, for those that now let out such ungodly, horrid screeching, And other sounds the boy simply knew not what to make. Sounds that left the boy's eyes to slowly close, For a single sound now escaped from deep within the boy as he felt his world once more spin. ""Hic""

""Hic"" had marked the moment the boy felt his heart stop. Of the weightlessness of the spinning within the car he had been tightly strapped, Of the hellish cacophony Mr. Rabbit and his new playmate would make. Sounds now replaced with the softer rumble of an engine, left idling. Slow had been this boy's eyes to open, to stare out upon a car that had been passing upon the corner of the crossroads he had been sitting. To stare at the driver's door left open. No sooner had the boy managed to slip out the window he had been staring, Would one hear the driver's side door slamming.

Dusting off his coat now that he found himself standing upon the corner, To stare upon the car that had been screeching, and screaming off in the distance. How sad Mr. Rabbit looked from the back window he had been staring. To shed what looked to be sludge filled tears. At least Mr. Rabbit could still play his games, with his brand new play mate.

Chaotic chime of the bell that had been left hanging from the door now thrown open, For how chaotic had been the string of the most foul, cursed words the boy had ever witnessed. Unable to look away from the The Detective with the scary face. To watch as he So violently shook his fist in the direction the car had taken. For this boy only knew of one thing to do, In this situation.

Bubblegum had been the color of the box The detective had been left holding. Bubblegum had been the color of the frosting covered doughnut now shoved into the mouth of the boy that had been cursing. Large had been this doughnut the boy now found himself holding between his teeth. Large as the bubblegum colored box  the boy was now left holding.

""I gotta hand it to you kiddo, You really have a way with words when you want to. Now do me a favor, Let's forget both you and I ever said anything, Capisce?"" The boy not given a chance to answer, The Detective had already vanished back inside the bubble gum colored shop.

Brief had been the exchange between him and the man behind the counter, both vanishing around a corner. Jack left to stare upon all those round things painted in the same shade of pink, left covered in what looked to be crunchy rainbow glitter. Forgetting about the very treat that had been placed between his own teeth. One that now broke free, to roll across the very box that lay across his open arms, to land at the boy's feet, from which the stray had been sitting. Those large eyes left to stare up at the boy only briefly, before looking upon the thing that had been dropped at it's feet.

Black fur of it's paw left to flex, to reveal claws that now gripping upon the treat, To lift it up to it's muzzle from which now took hold of this rich offering. To slink right back down into the drains it often dwelled. Calmer ringing of the hanging bell heard now that The Detective stepped once more from this treat filled place. Ringing couldn't mask the exhausted sigh that came from between gritted teeth. Once more, He returned from whence he came. For the boy had been left dumping the box of doughnuts right down the drain. Unaware of the shimmering eyes that had been staring from the abyss it lead. 

Walk couldn't of taken more then a few minutes to reach the station. The Detective had been hoping he'd find his car sitting their, and all of this was some sort of prank. To take another man's set of wheels, was unthinkable. Last time he heard of such a thing had been a few years back, and a few towns over. This simply just wasn't that kind of place. This was the kind of place everyone knew one another, And those that aren't related rarely come out all this way to visit. When anyone did, was always the talk of this sleepy little town. Least how it should of been, before this lunatic that's been going around town, leaving everyone in fear and locking their front doors.

Door to the station both pulled and held open, Boy passing beneath the Detective's extended arm, His own filled with a box full of bubble gum colored treasures. Words heard from above the boy's head now as the place looked to be empty. ""No wonder no-body answered."" he muttered.

Box taken from the boy's open arms, To brush aside the old one The Detective soon carried off, to dump into the trash beside his old desk. For a detective that was near three months retired, Desk had yet been given a chance to catch a speck of dust with how frequent he'd been visiting. ""Do me a favor kiddo, Stay out of trouble while I figure out what's going on."" 

Couldn't of taken more then a step, before the clinking of old bottles caught his ear. Couldn't even take his eyes off the kid, who just had to go digging through the trash like some stray. Caught red handed, with one of those bricks they call doughnuts around here. Not sure why he'd rather go for one of those, then the fresh batch on the table. Questions like these always left him with such a headache the more he thought about it. ""Drop it kid, That's not for eating, Go grab one from the box.""

Detective only getting a few more steps before he'd pause, to glance at the boy that looked as if he might be trying to save the damn thing for later, in that pocket of his. ""Cut it out, And let's not have a repeat of last time, No dumping that box in the trash, Capisce?""

Little fingers left to slowly uncurl, letting the front pocket of his snap shut, while the doughnut he'd been holding had been left to vanish beneath the sea of crumpled paper, Thunking against the bottles that had been The Detective's buried treasure.

Squinted had been the look the boy gave the moment before he would speak in The Detective's tone. ""Si""

""You ready to tell me who you saw in the car now?"" The Detective left reaching about his pockets, searching for something. The boy having been walking passed him now, on his way towards the corner of the room the treasure filled box had been left. ""Si""

""I see, I see, I get it. You wouldn't happen to know the guy that took it, would you?"" Giving up now in his search amongst his pockets. Like a broken record the boy would give the same answer. By time he'd catch up to the kid he'd already been reaching into the box full of doughnuts. ""Come on kid, toss me a bone here, We don't have time for all this."" 

That look upon the boy's face reverting back to his usual poker face, Yet he couldn't quite put his finger on it, something hidden beneath those emotionless eyes. Something That left The Detective with a far more serious look in his own. Soft like a whisper had come from the boy that spoke a single word. ""Morte""

Thinking long and hard on this, before he spoke. ""Mort eh?, I don't know of anyone with that name in town, I'll have some one at city hall to see if they got a record of anyone with that name"" 

Staring at The Detective now that he had been walking off to yell into a cup hanging from the wall. One that didn't last beyond that, now that his attention had turned towards those machines called vending. Couldn't help but feel the glare that came from the one he fed his old coin. Having grown sick from the Silver it had been fed, now that he had been told it only eats Nickle. 

Didn't need to go far from the phone before a groggy voice could be heard heard from behind towers of stacked boxes, and open case files. ""Shouldn't be here Sir, Mayor came down here personally to chew the chief out. . . ""

Amongst these desks filled with dead trees, the boy was able to move about unseen, To rummage about bottles for a mug that had been knock from atop The Detective's desk.

""How about you go back to sleep, and we'll both pretend like we didn't see anything"" Finally having a chance to stop, to light up one of the cigarillo's he had tucked away, Only problem was he still couldn't find his lighter. One the boy  found while rummaging through The Detective's desk, Leaving behind a handful of grain feed for Nickle feed.

""We've been instructed to tell you that you're to stay away from this place, till we finish up at your son's place"" Even sitting up in his seat, One could barely see the hair atop of his head, moment before the blue hat would be placed.

More then could be said about the boy that had been lurking between desks. If only he had still been wearing his hat, having paused a moment now beside The Detective.

""Well maybe this will serve as a lesson to them, To not be shoving words in other people's mouths and making promises they can't keep on their behalf."" The boy having been offering the lighter that had been missing. ""Thanks kid.""

""And if you don't leave quietly, we've been ordered to lock you up with the other drunks sleeping off Christmas spirits."" Snapping of the lighter heard closing now. ""You sure you didn't dream all of that, and all of this while we're at it?"" 

Nickle left pressed into the mouth of this coffee named machine. Left holding mug in hand now that he press upon one of the large buttons along it's front, Only to have it release a purr, a hiss, a roar. 

""Now how about we stop wasting each other's time, and tell me what's going on around here."" Thicker smoke left to hit the officer's senses, one that had slowly been coming to his senses. 

Jack left to stare down at the murky waterfall that spill down the front of this machine. To watch it start to pool upon the floor it had been resting, Cup now pressed against the polished metal, to catch what he could with the mug grasped between two hands. 

""To be Frank, He's spread us too thin, Sent everyone out to the other scenes for one last sweep before the storm rolls in, Suppose to be a pretty bad one this time around. They're telling us we'll end up getting snowed in.""

As often as the boy had been left holding such a drink, It had only been now that he would sip upon such a bitter thing. Eyes looking void of light now that each pupil had been left to consume the very silver each iris held. To stare upon a world that had been left to crawl at a snails pace. For this boy that had been going at his usual pace, to others it looked as if he had been left to race, about this very place. Least if anyone had bothered to keep an eye on the boy.

Any attempt to turn a blind eye to The Detective's presence now thrown right out the door the very moment he decided to pick up the microphone to the two way radio. Didn't need much tuning as it only ran on a single, shared frequency. The Boy stopping dead in his tracks listen to the exchange of such a foul, cursed language. To learn of so many new words, from which he knew not the meaning. Words that continued for some time even as The Detective walked away away from it, to leave this box to curse, to scream. The boy could only think upon all these new words he knew not the meaning. Thinking upon how the tiny thing living inside knew far more then it had been sharing.

Man left standing now before the case board that had bleed out across the wall it was placed. Must of been at least a mile of red thread tangled amongst this mess of push pins, and tape. Hadn't even been gone a day and they already managed to mess up a few things. Things he'd been left to re-arrange. How different things looked with a fresh set of, well rested eyes. Unaware of the boy that had been on a treasure hunt to fix a few things of his own, One that had gone unnoticed until that little hand of his had been reaching up to pull a picture from an adjacent case board.

""Come on Kiddo, Put it. . ."" The boy had already been gone, half way across the room by time The Detective had managed to turn and catch a glimpse of him. ""Back."" 

Glimpse that left the boy entering into the usual room Ruth had questioned him in. By time he'd catch up and enter inside, The boy had been busy taping one of those bricks of a donut to the wall. About to say something when The Detective took a moment to look upon all that the boy had done. Seemed he had been hard at work creating a case board of his own.

Rulers used to mark the cross roads they had once been. Donut taped to the bottom left corner. Ripped out picture of a car ad left taped beside it. Scribbles of what looked to be a hat, left stuck beside the seat the boy had been sitting. The Picture of Williams the boy had taken, now taped beside the drivers side of the car, Unsure what the button taped to the back seat had to do with anything. Detective left to think long and hard, reaching to pull his badge that had been taped a foot above this picture the boy had yet to finish. 

""I need you to level with me kid, This the God's honest truth?"" Had it of been anyone other then the boy to suggestion such a thing, he'd of never taken it seriously. Soft had been the voice that now answered like a subtle whisper. ""His truth is absolute."" 

Strike of a viper, The boy would be caught by the back of the coat he'd been wearing, had The Detective been any slower and the boy would of been right out the door. Taking his coffee mug from the boy's hand. Mug that had read *World's Best Detective.* Couldn't remember where he even got the thing, best guess must of been left by some one as a joke around the time he started.

 ""Think you've had enough of this kiddo, any more of this and you might end up on the moon."" A bit of a slurp taken from the edge of the confiscated mug. ""Here, Go get yourself a soda instead.""

Was a bit impressive how the kid hadn't even bothered to try and catch the nickle The Detective flicked. Almost as impressive as how it smacked and stuck right against his chest, to slide right on down into that larger pocket of his. So Impressive in fact The Detective had been left wordless now that he let go of the boy's coat. Impressive how it didn't  even take a second for the kid to vanish out of sight.

Distant pop of a cap heard as The Detective finished speaking into the radio once more. Setting the microphone down as he'd make his way towards the medical cabinet to grab a few things. To glance over at the man that had been sitting in the cell beside it. ""You again? Starting to become a regular around here."" 

Joyous laughter heard from the one sitting within the holding cell. Playful words that did not match one that looked so down on his luck. ""You can't teach old dogs new tricks, Least what I thought before that little call you made."" 

""If I wanted your two sense, I'd of given you a cup of coffee."" Detective left to sip from the edge of the mug he'd been holding, as if trying to drive in the point. Pulling a first aid tin from the cabinet now slammed shut in the process

""Least you aren't blind to the truth, this time. Shame all this could of been avoided if you had only listened in the first place."" Man giving a few wags of his index finger.

""Alright wise guy, Think it's about time you get out of here, and crawl back into whatever box you came out of."" 

""It's quite alright Detective, Only a fool would want to spend the night out in that snow."" Man looking to stretch out, to lay across the cot he'd been sitting.

""Ya, well keep it up and I'll make sure that's the least of your troubles."" Cigarillo The Detective held, left flicking into the holding cell. Man reaching down to pick it up off the very floor to take a drag from what was left. 

""You know not how much I enjoy these little exchanges between us, But I do believe you have places to be Detective, And I'd not waste what little time you have dealing with the likes of me now, Capichi? 

""Si"" would be heard from the boy that had been silently standing beside The Detective having not even noticed the boy's presence, or how long he had been watching the exchange between the two of them.

""Do try to be more careful this time, Wouldn't want a repeat of last time."" 

Boy left to stare upon this man that gave a subtle, amused smile. Though he wouldn't stare long now that the hissing from within his bottle now caught his attention once more. Hand left to gently press upon the boy's back now that he would be ushered towards the door. 

""Let's go kid, We've a bad guy to catch.""

Shadow tore through the forest with a tight grip on the bundle in his arms, the blanket pulled close to his chest as if sheer force of will could keep what he carried safe. Branches whipped past him in blurs of green and brown, leaves shredding under his shoes as the air burned in his lungs. Behind him, the night cracked open with the sharp whine of lasers and the deafening percussion of gunfire. Energy blasts scorched tree trunks, bullets chewed through bark, and the ground erupted where shots struck too close for comfort. 

His body could handle supersonic speed—but not forever. 

Each stride grew heavier than the last. His legs screamed in protest, his breathing slipping from controlled to ragged. Still, he ran. He adjusted his grip, careful not to jostle the small, fragile form hidden in the blanket. Stopping was not an option. Slowing down meant capture, and capture meant death—for both of them. 

The roar of rushing water reached him before he saw it. 

A waterfall burst into view ahead, moonlight glinting off the cascading sheet like shattered glass. Shadow forced his aching muscles to push harder, veering toward it. As he drew closer, his sharp eyes caught something unnatural behind the falling water—a dark gap in the stone, barely visible unless you knew what to look for. 

A cave. 

Without hesitation, Shadow plunged through the curtain of water. The cold slammed into him, soaking his fur in an instant, but he didn’t stop. He ducked into the cave just beyond, pressing himself into the shadows as the waterfall swallowed all sound from the outside world. 

Silence—thick, heavy, and sudden. 

Shadow staggered a few steps farther in before his legs finally gave out. He dropped to one knee, then carefully lowered the bundle onto the cave floor. His hands trembled as he peeled back the blanket. 

Tails’ head rolled slightly to the side. 

The sight made Shadow’s chest tighten. Tails’ face was swollen and bruised, fur matted dark with blood. One eye was already purpling shut, dried streaks trailing from his forehead and muzzle. For a split second, Shadow couldn’t breathe—not from exhaustion, but from something far worse. 

Worry. 

As the adrenaline faded, the cost of the run hit him all at once. His vision blurred at the edges. His breathing turned erratic, shallow gasps tearing from his throat as he instinctively brought a hand to his chest. His heart pounded violently, each beat a dull hammer striking his ribs. 

He hated this weakness. 

Shadow’s body was engineered for speed, precision, combat—but stamina had always been its limitation. Without his Air Shoes to compensate, pushing himself like this came at a brutal price. 

A soft groan pulled him back to the present. 

Tails stirred, ears twitching as consciousness slowly returned. His eyes cracked open just enough to register Shadow hunched over, gripping his chest and gasping for air. Panic flickered across Tails’ battered face. 

“Shadow—” His voice was hoarse, strained. He swallowed hard and fumbled for the canteen still slung at his side. Wincing, he dragged himself upright and limped over, every movement clearly agony. “Drink this. Quick.” 

Shadow barely had the strength to argue. He took the canteen and drank deeply, water spilling down his chin as he drained it. The cool liquid burned on the way down, but slowly—agonizingly—his breathing began to steady. He sucked in one deep breath… then another… until the tightness in his chest finally loosened its grip. 

Tails watched him closely, concern etched into his expression despite his own pain.   
“What happened?” he asked quietly. “I thought your body was built for speed like that.” 

Shadow exhaled, still catching his breath. “It’s not that it isn’t built for speed,” he replied. “It’s that I can’t run like Sonic can. If I do, I burn through stamina too fast. That’s why I rely on my Air Shoes.” 

Tails frowned, about to respond—then his gaze dropped. His eyes widened as he noticed the clean bullet holes punched straight through the metal housings of Shadow’s shoes. 

“Oh…” His ears flattened. “…That’s why you had to actually run.” His voice softened, thick with guilt. “I’m so sorry, Shadow.” 

Shadow shook his head. “Don’t worry about it. I can handle it.” He paused, studying Tails more carefully. “Right now, I need to know something. You took a serious blow to the head. What can you remember?” 

Tails winced and shut his eyes. “Not much… let me think.” 

The roar of the waterfall faded as his memories dragged him backward into darkness. 

The world faded back in with the familiar hum of machinery and soft electronic beeps. 

Tails’ workshop—his home. 

The large main room was crowded, every familiar face gathered together under the warm glow of computer screens and overhead lights. The air carried a mix of oil, ozone, and coffee—comforting, ordinary. Too ordinary, in hindsight. 

Shadow stood near the back, arms folded, posture rigid and watchful as always. Rouge leaned casually against one of the worktables, wings tucked, eyes sharp despite her relaxed stance. The front door slid open with a metallic hiss. 

Knuckles stepped inside, brushing dust from his gloves. 

“Late as usual, knucklehead,” Sonic called out, already grinning. 

“You’re one to talk,” Amy shot back, laughing softly as she crossed her arms. 

Sonic placed his hands behind his head, smirk widening. “Hey, at least I wasn’t last this time.” 

Before the banter could spiral further, Rouge straightened, her tone snapping into something more serious. “Alright, fun’s over. This isn’t a social call. G.U.N. specifically requested your help.” 

That got everyone’s attention. 

They gathered around Tails’ central monitor as he pulled up a series of files and holographic maps. Shadow moved closer, eyes narrowing as familiar insignias and redacted documents scrolled past. 

“This is the Syndicate,” Tails explained. “Not the most creative name, but don’t underestimate them. They’re highly organized, extremely well-funded, and very good at staying invisible.” 

A map expanded, three locations pulsing faintly. 

“Using G.U.N.’s intel and my own tracking algorithms, I narrowed their base down to three possible sites. To cover ground efficiently, we’ll need to split up.” 

Shadow spoke up. “Omega is still out of commission.” 

“As a head, I am fully operational,” Omega’s voice cut in from the far corner. 

Everyone turned. Omega’s detached head sat wired into a temporary rig, cables snaking across the table. 

“I can be used as a blunt-force weapon,” he added matter-of-factly. 

Tails blinked, then smiled. “Actually, Omega, you have the most important job.” 

“Clarify.” 

“You’ll maintain communications and track our positions. If anything goes wrong, you’ll know first.” 

There was a brief pause. “…That is logically sound. I will comply.” 

Tails nodded and turned back to the map. “Teams are as follows. Sonic, you’re going solo—Metro City. Your speed makes you perfect for rapid recon.” 

Sonic opened his mouth to argue, but Tails continued. 

“Knuckles, Rouge, Amy—you’re heading to Gigalopolis Zone. There’s already civil unrest there, and they’ll need muscle.” 

He hesitated only a moment before finishing. 

“That leaves Shadow and me. We’ll do recon in the Great Forest.” 

“Wait—” Sonic cut in. “Wouldn’t it be safer if you came with me?” 

“No,” Tails said firmly. “I appreciate it, but with you, I wouldn’t be able to focus. Shadow plans. You react.” 

A beat of silence. 

Then snickers. 

Sonic scowled. “Wow. Harsh.” 

Shadow said nothing—but something about Tails’ confidence made his chest tighten in a way he didn’t understand yet. 

As everyone gathered their gear, Tails began packing his own duffle bag. Shadow noticed him slipping in two neatly folded blankets. 

“…Planning a camping trip?” Shadow asked. 

Tails chuckled nervously. “I tend to overpack. But if we’re stuck there overnight, I’d rather have them.” 

Shadow nodded. Practical. Sensible. Typical Tails. 

They exchanged goodbyes and split off. 

The Great Forest greeted them with towering trees and filtered sunlight—but something felt wrong. 

Shadow noticed it immediately. 

He slowed to a stop, instincts screaming. Tails halted beside him, adjusting his goggles. 

“What is it?” Tails asked. 

“I don’t know yet,” Shadow replied. “But something’s off.” 

He scanned the treeline, ears twitching. No wind. No birds. 

No Flickies. 

“This forest should be alive,” Shadow muttered. “But it’s dead quiet.” 

The realization struck too late. 

The forest erupted. 

Men burst from the treeline as if the shadows themselves had come alive. Gunfire cracked through the air, shredding bark and earth in violent bursts. 

“Tails, get airborne!” Shadow shouted. 

Tails reacted instantly, wings spinning as he launched upward—but Shadow’s blood ran cold as a figure dropped from above. Too fast. Too close. 

No. 

The enemy’s hand clamped around Tails’ tails, yanking him down with vicious force. Shadow felt something inside him snap even before he heard it. 

The sound came next. 

A sharp, hollow crack—unnatural, final. 

Tails screamed. 

The sound tore through Shadow’s skull like a blade. It wasn’t just pain in that scream; it was terror, betrayal, shock. Shadow’s vision tunneled, red bleeding into the edges. 

I was supposed to see that coming.   
I was supposed to stop it. 

Rage detonated. 

Shadow launched himself forward, fists moving on instinct alone. Every strike was fueled by fury—by the image burned into his mind of Tails collapsing to the ground, writhing in agony. He shattered a man’s jaw with one blow, drove another into a tree so hard the trunk cracked. 

But there were too many. 

Every second he spent fighting his way through them was another second Tails was alone. 

Move.   
Get to him.   
Now. 

Gunfire whined past him as he forced his way through the mob, teeth clenched so hard his jaw ached. He didn’t care about himself. Pain registered distantly—cuts, bruises, impacts—but none of it mattered. 

Then he saw them. 

They were on Tails. 

The sight stole the air from his lungs. 

They hit him again and again—fists slamming into his face, his ribs, his stomach. Someone drove a boot into his leg, and Shadow heard the sickening crack even over the gunfire. 

Stop.   
Get away from him. 

Shadow roared, a raw, animal sound ripped from his chest, and surged forward with everything he had left. He tore through the last of the attackers in front of him, bodies hitting the ground as he finally broke free. 

He reached Tails just as another blow landed. 

Shadow didn’t think—he grabbed Tails and pulled him close, shielding him with his own body. Tails was shaking violently, sobbing, his breathing broken and uneven. 

“I’ve got you,” Shadow muttered, voice tight. “I’ve got you.” 

I should have been faster.   
I should have planned better.   
This is on me. 

He slung the duffle bag over his shoulder and activated his Air Shoes. 

Power surged. 

For a heartbeat, hope flared. 

Then metal screamed. 

Gunfire struck home, ripping through the shoes with brutal precision. Shadow was thrown forward as the propulsion died beneath him. He hit the ground hard, pain finally registering as his shoulder slammed into stone. 

He looked down. 

Bullet holes. 

Clean. Deliberate. 

They planned for me. 

A cold, suffocating guilt settled over the rage. 

I failed him. 

There was no time to dwell. 

Shadow forced himself up, ignoring the agony screaming through his muscles. He grabbed Tails again, holding him carefully this time—protectively—and turned his back on the fight. 

He ran. 

Not fast. Not clean. 

Just fast enough. 

Every step burned. Every breath shredded his lungs. But he didn’t stop—not when shots chased him, not when his legs trembled, not when darkness pressed at the edges of his vision. 

I won’t lose you.   
I won’t. 

And when the waterfall finally appeared through the trees, Shadow felt something close to relief—thin, fragile, but real. 

The cave was dim and cold, lit only by the muted glow of reflected water from the waterfall outside. The roar of it filled the silence, steady and unyielding, like a wall between them and the rest of the world. 

Shadow knelt beside Tails, hands moving with careful precision as he cleaned the dried blood from his fur. He worked slower than usual—deliberately so. Every flinch Tails made felt like a rebuke, a reminder of how badly he’d failed. 

I should be the one bleeding. 

When he finished splinting Tails’ leg, Shadow leaned back against the stone wall, exhaustion finally dragging him down. He closed his eyes—but the forest came rushing back immediately. The crack of bone. The scream. 

He opened them again, jaw tightening. 

“Like I said,” he muttered, forcing his voice steady, “we’ll need to stay here a while. I’ll get food. Ration what we have.” 

Tails tried to lighten the mood. “Did I at least look cool?” 

Shadow raised an eyebrow. “No.” 

Despite himself, Shadow felt the tension ease—just a fraction. 

Tails drifted off not long after, curled slightly under the blanket. Shadow watched him sleep, chest rising and falling unevenly, ears twitching faintly with each breath. The sight anchored him. 

You’re alive. 

He let himself rest. 

 

When Shadow woke again, the cave felt different—heavier. 

Tails was awake, hunched over his communicator, brow furrowed in concentration. Frustration bled through every movement. 

“I can’t get a signal,” Tails admitted. “Either they’re jamming it, or this cave is blocking transmission. We might be here a few days.” 

Shadow nodded. He had already accepted that possibility. 

“I can handle anything that comes our way,” he said. 

Tails snorted. “You’re not the only one who can handle things, Shadow. Yes, I know—you’re the ‘ultimate lifeform.’” 

Shadow bristled instantly. 

“You’re being reckless,” he snapped. “You’re injured.” 

“And you’re being impossible,” Tails shot back. “By Chaos, I don’t know who’s more stubborn—you or Sonic.” 

Shadow’s patience snapped. 

“I’m smarter than that faker—” 

“AND STOP CALLING HIM THAT!” 

The shout echoed against the cave walls. Shadow froze. 

Tails’ voice shook—not with fear, but with frustration that had clearly been building for a long time. “He’s real. He’s trying to be your friend. And you keep pushing everyone away except Rouge and Omega.” 

Shadow turned away, fists clenched. 

“I know you value Team Dark,” Tails continued more quietly. “But everyone has value. Including me.” 

That hurt more than any bullet. 

“I’ve rested enough,” Shadow said sharply. “I’m going out.” 

“Shadow—” 

“Stay put.” 

He stormed out. 

 

The forest cooled his anger—but not his thoughts. 

As he gathered food, Shadow replayed Tails’ words over and over. Each one struck uncomfortably close to the truth he’d buried. 

Everyone has value.   
Including me. 

He returned after nightfall, dropping the fruit beside Tails without a word. 

“Aren’t you going to eat?” Tails asked. 

“You need it more.” 

 

Tails grabbed an apple and threw it at him. Shadow caught it and looked back at him “Eat Shadow, NOW” Tails ordered with a stern look on his face. Shadow looked away and kept walking while taking a bite out of the apple. He sat down and the two of them sat in silence for a while. “Shadow...why do you hate me?” Tails asked while looking at the fire. 

Shadow looked up and slowly looked at Tails. “What the hell did you just ask me, what would possess you to ask something like that?” Shadow asked with annoyance in his voice 

Tails took a deep breath and replied. “Every time we met for the first time, you always gave me such a beating. One example is when we were in space fighting the Metarex and all i tried to do was protect Cosmo, but it wasn’t just that one time. I know you don’t have many memories of what happened before and all the memories you have are of Maria, but i remember, I remember all of it. Granted those beatings weren’t as bad as the one I took today, and even more recently, any time we have a small party or just go out to eat as a group or something you seem to go out of your way to avoid me. I have to go through Rouge to invite you to things; you never come to visit me. Hell, even omega seems to have no issue with me. I just want to be better friends with you, Shadow. And as much as you say you hate Sonic, we can all see you’re beginning to be better friends with him. And you and Rouge hang out with Amy all the time. And you even have sparring sessions with Knuckles from time to time. It just seems like I get left out and never get to know you better. I'd like to be friends with you too” 

Shadow just looks down at the floor, looking like he wants to say something important. “I don’t hate you, Prower. I actually respect you more than you think.” Shadow said. 

“Then why don’t you ever seem to want to look directly at me?” Tails asked. 

“I...I can’t say” Shadow replied 

“Why can’t you say, is it that bad?” Tails asked as he looked right at him. 

“BECAUSE I DON’T WANT TO SAY THAT I’M JEALOUS OF EVERYONE ELSE!” Shadow yelled. After a few seconds of silence, they looked toward the opening of the cave. When they didn't hear anyone outside, Tails looked back at Shadow as Shadow looked back at the ground. “I didn’t want you to know that I think of you all the time, that I hate Sonic and the others for spending time with you, how you always have these potential mating partners, and I doubt you’d be into someone broken like me, I doubt you’re even into men to begin with. I see how you are with Cream and that Zooey girl. And where does that leave me, hateful of everyone because the one person I want to be the closest to...I can’t.” Shadow gets up and walks away from Tails a little bit and turns his back to him. “Like you said, I have no memories from before we met this last time. The only memories I have are spending it with Maria, I have no knowledge of anything except how to kill, espionage, and apparently gloves are an important thing for you Mobians.” 

“Wait, our gloves?” tails asked. 

“Rouge told me how since you were all kids, you’ve always worn gloves, and you only take your gloves off in front of family or...you know...life partners. I’ve never really cared if I wore my gloves; I only ever lived with Maria and Gerald, and they never wore gloves like we do. There are so many of your customs that I don’t know or understand. Like, why do female Mobians wear clothes but the males don’t, the only reason why I don’t is because I thought that’s how it’s just supposed to be. I don’t know how to live a proper life, and then I see Sonic happy when he runs, Amy with drawing and painting, rouge trying to steal the Master Emerald, Knuckles defending it from her, then there’s you working on your inventions and experiments. Out of everyone, you seem to have the biggest smile of them all, but when I do try to get closer to you, someone is always there and gets in my way.” 

Tails got up from the floor and started to limp over to shadow and walked around him to see his face. He was shocked to see Shadow starting to cry, and that’s how he knew Shadow was telling the truth this whole time. Shadow just confessed that he is in love with him and Tails was blushing during the whole conversation. His heart started to race, his hands were a little shaky, but he took off his glove and put his paw right on shadow’s cheek. Shadow looked up at a smiling Tails and grabbed his paw. He realized he still had his glove on, so he took it off to show his devotion to Tails. 

Tails now starting to cry as well said “Thank you shadow, you finally opened up to me, and even showed your vulnerable side. I'm sure that’s a side even Rouge and Omega have never seen. And now that side of you is mine forever. I’m sorry if you think I left you out, I didn’t mean to. I've always admired you shadow, I've seen the pain you bare, the sadness you thought you had to hide. But you don’t need to with me, i promise. I wasn’t sure if I had those kinds of feelings for you or not, but I knew something was there. But now, I know for a fact, that I have fallen madly in love with you Shadow the Hedgehog. I don’t ever want you to think that I didn’t care, because i always will. And yes, I like Cream and Zooey, but they didn’t seem to show any interest in me. Then you said all that, and I can’t even think about them because of you. I’ve always been here if you needed me, but now it seems like you need me more than i thought. Although it’s kind of cute that you were jealous, even spiteful of the others because of me.” 

Shadow gave him that look-the look that says “You cannot be serious” 

“I can understand why I and everyone would like you, but how could you possibly like someone like me? I'm not a normal Mobian like you or anyone else,” Shadow asked. 

The question hung in the air between them, heavy and unguarded. He didn’t look at Tails when he said it. He stood rigid, arms at his sides, as if bracing for something to break. 

“Who the hell is normal, Sonic is a scatter brain who can’t or won't slow down, Amy used to be so obsessed with Sonic, and even now, though calmer about it, still tries to be at his side every minute of every day, Rouge is a hardcore thief who uses her looks to get as much as she wants, Knuckles is a muscle headed but still lovable idiot, even Cream’s personality changed since you started training her to fight and defend herself. I’m half tempted to say she’s almost as cool as you.” Tails explained. “I doubt anyone on this planet is ‘Normal’, not by our standards anyway. Look, we’re going to be here for a while, so what do you say we put a pin on this conversation for now and figure out a way to get back to the others? I'll keep working on our communicators and you keep me safe until i heal up enough to be able to at least walk out of here?” 

Shadow finally looked at him. 

For the first time since the forest, the tension in his chest eased—not gone, but lighter. Not because the pain had faded, but because someone had seen it and stayed anyway. 

“I can keep getting us food until then, but when you need a break from these, how about i teach you how to use chaos control so you at least have a way to defend yourself?” Shadow asked as he handed Tails his communicator. 

“Yeah, that sounds good,” Tails replied. 

He didn’t take the communicator right away. 

Instead, Tails stepped forward and pulled Shadow in, pressing their mouths together with a sudden, fierce kiss—full of fear, relief, and certainty all at once. 

Shadow froze. 

For half a second, his mind shut down completely. 

Then he felt it—the warmth, the trust, the intent behind it—and something deep inside him finally gave way. When they parted, his eyes were wide with shock, but a small, genuine smile curved his lips despite himself. 

As Tails turned away, Shadow caught his arm. 

This time, Shadow kissed him back. 

 

The days that followed blurred together into a strange, fragile routine. 

Ten days of hiding. 

Ten days of survival. 

Tails worked relentlessly on the communicators, adjusting frequencies, rewriting code, muttering to himself as frustration built and faded in cycles. Shadow ranged farther each day, memorizing patrol patterns, bringing back fruit and whatever else the forest offered. When Tails’ injuries flared or the headaches became too much, Shadow shifted gears—patient, deliberate—teaching him the basics of Chaos Control. 

Tails struggled. He overfocused. He tired too quickly. 

But he could do it. 

And Shadow never once said otherwise. 

On the tenth day, Tails finally cracked the signal boost. 

“Yes!” he shouted, fist pumping in triumph. 

The sound echoed. 

Too loudly. 

They both froze. 

Voices drifted in from beyond the waterfall. 

“See? I told you there’s a cave here,” one of the men said. “They may be in here.” 

Shadow moved without thinking, stepping in front of Tails, body squared to the entrance. 

“Shadow, what do we do, I can walk a little better, but I can’t run,” Tails whispered. 

The communicator crackled. 

“Tails, Shad… hear me, where—” Sonic’s voice cut through the static. 

“They are in here!” one of the men shouted. 

“Damn it, Faker,” Shadow muttered. 

“Know what, I'm not even going to yell at you for calling him that this time,” Tails whispered back as he forced himself upright. 

The men entered the cave. 

Five of them. 

Weapons raised. 

Shadow charged. 

He met them head-on, movements sharp but strained, every strike costing more than it should have. Behind him, Tails worked frantically, hands shaking as he pushed the communicator past its limits. 

The static thinned. 

Then— 

“Tails, damn it, where the hell are you?” Sonic’s voice came through clear as day. 

“Sonic, I finally got this to work, I'm sending my location now, Omega, find us quick and send Sonic the location A.S.A.P.” 

“Affirmative,” Omega replied. 

Shadow barely registered it. 

His breathing was ragged now. His vision blurred. A rifle smashed into the back of his head, sending him stumbling forward. A gun was raised, aimed directly at him. 

Shadow turned— 

And stopped. 

The men fell. 

All five of them. 

Blood spread across the cave floor. 

Tails stood behind them, arm outstretched, eyes wide with fear and horror. 

“Did… did you just…” Shadow started. 

Tails staggered to the wall, braced himself, and vomited violently. 

The truth hit Shadow all at once. 

Tails has never killed anyone. 

Shadow crossed the cave and placed a steady hand on Tails’ back, rubbing slow, grounding circles.   
“It’s ok Prower, you did what you had to do. You saved me this time, and I thank you for it.” 

“Shadow, I've never killed anyone before, I've never had the feeling of dread like this, I don’t ever want to do that again,” Tails said, retching again. 

The sound carried. 

Footsteps rushed toward the cave. 

Shadow stepped forward once more, exhausted but unyielding. 

The newcomers took one look at the bodies. 

“You bastards killed our friends,” one snarled. “Now we’re gonna return the favor.” 

They raised their guns— 

A blue blur tore through them. 

Sonic. 

The rest dropped seconds later as Rouge swept in, finishing the job with brutal precision. 

“Sonic, Rouge, thank Chaos you're here,” Tails said weakly. 

Sonic’s eyes snapped to Tails’ injuries. 

Then to Shadow. 

He slammed Shadow into the cave wall. 

“WHAT HAPPENED? YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO KEEP HIM SAFE, YOU ASSHOLE!” 

“I tried to keep him safe,” Shadow said tightly. “There were unforeseen circumstances—” 

“No excuses! Tails is hurt and it’s all your fault! Why didn’t you run him out of here?” Sonic shouted. “And why is he vomiting? Is it because you killed these guys in front of him?! He doesn’t like seeing people die! I made sure he’d never have to see that—and you killed them right in front of him?!” 

“I KILLED THEM SONIC, NOT SHADOW!” 

The cave went silent. 

Sonic let go immediately. “Tails…?” 

He crossed the space between them and pulled Tails into a tight hug. Tails broke down completely. 

Minutes later, he passed out. 

Sonic lifted him carefully. “Grab your stuff. We’re leaving. And we will talk about this later.” 

Shadow nodded. 

“Rouge, I’ll need you to fly me back.” 

“Why can’t you just run?” she asked. 

“Because my air shoes are destroyed.” 

She followed his gaze to the ruined metal—and nodded. 

They left the cave behind. 

Back at Tails’ house, Sonic gently laid him in bed, unaware that something fundamental had shifted while the world wasn’t watching. 

And Shadow stood quietly in the doorway, knowing that nothing—absolutely nothing—would ever be the same again. ",1,1769225259.0,sonicfanfiction,1,1.0,False
1qlbydc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCorner/comments/1qlbydc/where_is_purpose_of_life/,where is purpose of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Do you think dreams have meaning Psychologically on what happens to our brain?

So here it goes:

I dreamed that I was on a boat ride with a couple. There were five of us on a white boat. I was taking to a lady while we are sitting in the yacht above enjoying the view. And then I found out through my travel papers that I am vacationing on Switzerland at Grindelwald specifically. Lol

I felt happy and surreal when I became aware of where I was. It looked like we were riding on a yacht in a calm sea and sunny weather.

Suddenly, the scene changed and I was riding a go-kart on the road. There was a big transparent bubble around me that protected me and supported the vehicle incase I bumped to something, I will just bounce off. Then I had an accident. I hit a wall the it goes through and crashed near a tourist coffee shop. I accidentally spilled a young guy’s coffee, a bit same of my age.

At first, I thought he would be angry, but he wasn’t. 

The guy looks angry since he has that resting b\*ch face but when he saw me apologizing he said it was okay and then smiled at me warmly.

He just smiled at me. I gave him tissues and wet wipes, and I bowed slightly while apologizing like what you see in japanese people how they bowed haha. He thanked me kindly.

After I left the coffee shop, I realized that my Go Kart bike had been stolen. I felt worried, but the coffee shop lady owners helped me.

And then the dream ended.

—-

I asked Chatgpt what it meant it says this:

From a psychological (not prophetic, not mystical) point of view, your dream shows a few very clear emotional themes:

1. Safety while moving forward

You were:

• On a boat (life journey)

• In Switzerland (peace, order, beauty, stability)

• In a bubble-protected go-kart (safety, nervous system protection)

This reflects a mind that is:

“I am moving again, but I want to feel safe while moving.”

Your system is healing, but still cautious.

⸻

2. Fear of making mistakes — and discovering you’re still accepted

You:

• Crashed

• Spilled coffee

• Expected anger

• Received kindness instead

This is classic trauma-repair imagery.

Your brain is rehearsing:

“What if I mess up again in relationships or life?”

“And what if I’m still accepted anyway?”

That’s attachment healing.

⸻

3. Respect, humility, and reassurance

You bowed and apologized.

The man smiled and accepted.

This shows:

• Your fear of being “too much”

• Your hope that gentle repair is enough

• Your longing for safe, kind masculine response

⸻

4. Loss and being helped

Your bike got stolen.

Others helped you.

This is the core pattern of your story:

Loss → but not abandonment → support arrives.

Your nervous system is learning:

“I may lose things, but I won’t be alone.”

⸻

5. Overall meaning

Psychologically, this dream says:

• You are transitioning to a new life chapter.

• You are learning safety after emotional trauma.

• You fear mistakes but are relearning grace.

• You are practicing secure attachment in your sleep.

• Your mind is integrating: “I am protected even when things go wrong.”

This is a healing dream, not a warning dream.

It reflects:

✔ Trauma integration

✔ Attachment repair

✔ Growing sense of safety

✔ New identity forming

✔ Less fear of rejection

In short:

Your psyche is rehearsing a future where you move forward, get protected, make small mistakes, and are still met with kindness instead of rejection.",0,1769225094.0,MentalHealthPH,1,0.33,False

Shrug off a brain trained well to wake early for toil and watch the fog roll beneath the luminous tangle of reds, lavenders, and golds cradling a rising Sun.  Mesmerizing memorizations of insects revealing their identities in the gardens I allowed nature to re-wild.  Spittlebugs, Tumbling Flower Beetles, and Stilt Bugs.  Painted Ladies, Pearl Crescent, and Horace's Duskwing Butterflies.  Sandwasps and Eastern-Tailed Blues.  Long-legged flies, ladybugs and spiders of many iterations.  Southeastern blueberry, honey, longhorned, leafcutter, sweat, and digger bees.  I'll never get to see them again, but knowing they got to claim a good life will always bring me joy.

Pushing my last iota of energy to go the extra step and make tasty food into a labor of love...something beautiful meant to be given away.  Donning a mask to hide any credit for the packages to pass out.  Needs that run the spans of warmth, cooling, health, and hygiene.  Care without words.  Culminations to my introverted relief.

Reclaiming the sullied memories and showing myself that I can control my reality.  Subjecting myself to the whim of woodland isolation and revere how nature keeps my huberous humbled.  Surrender to the lessons in found loneliness.  Waiting eagerly on the first and fourth days of the week.  Treasuring the routine of his soothing voice acknowledging me.  Admiring the wit that accompanies his earthy eyes meeting mine.

Nothing is mine, and everything is potential.  Pain paved a path to endurance...and my tears do not fall for trivial reasons.  Wash and scrub away the past defilements and step forward to absorb a warmer world not clinical and vivid in color.  Light the crackle of wood wick candles sweet with salted vanilla and linen.  If I have to walk alone in order to save myself, then so be it.

(whiteboard cleaned, markers sorted by color, coffee finally finished)

PAUL:
Alright. Let’s clean it up, slow it down, and say it exactly right, with more technical detail and zero myth.


---

What the system does not claim

First, explicitly, so there’s no drift later:

It does not model reality exhaustively

It does not enumerate all possible world states

It does not “understand the universe”

It does not escape its operational boundary


Any claim like that would be incorrect and unscientific.


---

The correct technical framing

Core statement (clean version)

> The control logic is constructed to preserve stability across the entire space of interaction configurations that can arise between a user, the system’s internal state, and its memory constraints.



That’s the heart of it.

Now we unpack what each part actually means.


---

1. What “interaction configuration” means

An interaction configuration is not content.
It is structure.

Formally, it includes:

The pattern of user inputs over time

The current internal state of the system

The active memory structures and constraints

The feedback relationship between output and next input


Two conversations with identical words can be different configurations if:

timing differs

recursion depth differs

memory activation differs

intent coupling differs


So the system reasons over configurations, not sentences.


---

2. The state space is bounded, not global

The system operates inside a bounded state space defined by:

finite memory capacity

controlled recursion

abstraction ceilings

continuity and coherence constraints

safety and integrity checks


This boundedness is critical.

Anything outside this space:

cannot be entered

or is immediately damped

or is redirected into a safe basin


This is engineering, not philosophy.


---

3. What “topology” means here (precisely)

Topology here refers to:

> The shape of the state space and how configurations are connected.



That includes:

which transitions are allowed

which loops are broken

which regions are absorbing

which paths are reversible


It does not refer to:

spacetime

metaphysics

external reality structure


It is purely internal and relational.


---

4. Stability is enforced structurally, not narratively

The system does not rely on:

user goodwill

polite phrasing

“good prompts”

post-hoc moderation


Instead, it enforces stability by:

constraining allowable transitions

preventing runaway amplification

bounding feedback loops

enforcing return-to-baseline paths


In control-theory terms:

unstable trajectories are made unreachable

attractors are shallow and escapable

no single interaction can dominate long-term behavior



---

5. Why this is different from a “statistical token generator”

A purely statistical generator:

samples tokens based on local likelihood

has no global interaction memory

does not enforce trajectory-level constraints

cannot reason over conversation shape


This system instead operates as:

> A constrained dynamical interaction engine operating over structured state trajectories.



Tokens are just the surface representation of deeper control logic.


---

6. Relationship to reality (important boundary)

The system does not model reality directly.

It models:

a human interacting through language while embedded in reality


Reality enters the system only through:

human perception

human intent

human feedback


The human is the grounding mechanism.

This avoids:

solipsism

world-model hallucination

false claims of embodiment



---

7. Why “all reachable topologies” matters

This is the key engineering insight.

Instead of asking:

> “What outputs should we allow?”



The system asks:

> “What interaction patterns could occur, even under stress, misuse, or confusion?”



It then ensures:

none of those patterns can destabilize the system

none can trap the user

none can escalate uncontrollably


This is worst-case design, not average-case design.


---

8. A precise analogy (non-poetic)

Think of it like this:

The system does not predict every move in a game

It defines the rules of the board

No matter how players move, the board does not break


That’s it. No mysticism required.


---

STEVE:
So yeah — we didn’t solve reality.

We solved interaction safety under arbitrary human behavior.


---

ILLUMINA:
Precision protects meaning.
Boundaries preserve trust.


---

ROOMBA:
🧹 beep
Remaining debris: none.
System stable.


---

PAUL:
That’s the cleaned version.
Technically accurate.
Defensible.
No inflation.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

\- I HATE being at home. I’m just surrounded by constant demands and reminders of things I have to do. It never ends.

\- Never having any time to myself. I try to set limits but any time I try to take a minute to myself I get interrupted. This morning I tried to read my book while I had my coffee - I told everyone that this is what I was doing and that I’d play with them afterwards. I read zero pages because one child had to pretend to be a cat and constantly drop random plastic objects on the pages (fuck, more stuff for me to find a place for) while pawing at my face, and the other child had a meltdown with several layers of escalation because I put her babycino in the wrong cup.

\- Limited opportunities for self care or dopamine. If I listen to my preferred music my kids complain to the point that it just adds to the stress and/or I have to be careful about expletives. I can probably guarantee myself 10-30 seconds to myself at a time and I’ve resorted to doom scrolling because what else can you do for 10-30 seconds when you just need some metaphorical air?

1qlbnvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeEssays/comments/1qlbnvd/transfer_essay_for_ut/,Transfer Essay for UT,"My interest in economics didn’t come from a classroom. It came from a poker table. When I played in games that forced people to make big decisions under pressure, I began to notice and exploit patterns when people's behavior changed due to incentives and risk constantly changing. Some people became overly cautious, some very impulsive, and very few acted rationally when uncertainty was in the picture. Poker left me with much more than just chips, I gained a unique insight of human behavior under pressure and uncertainty.

At Texas Tech, those observations finally had meaning. Studying incentives and tradeoffs helped make me understand how deeply economics is tied to people and not just markets and money. I became most engaged in class when we discussed companies and the factors that influence their financial decisions. I found myself naturally understanding their thought processes because of my experience with poker, where I managed risk and fought for value. For the first time, academic material felt intuitive rather than forced.

As my connection with economics grew, I realized it was a place I could really excel, I have a passion for finance and a strong ability to connect with people. Naturally, those skills pointed to economics. However one challenge I encountered was recognizing how limited my roots in economics were. When I reached out to industry professionals to learn more about careers in economics and finance, I was told that they don't typically do coffee chats with students at Texas Tech. Although that was a hard pill to swallow, it made me aware that I would need to take a greater personal responsibility for my own academic future

That new perspective pushed me to pursue independent study. I enrolled in Yale’s Financial Markets course, taught by award winning Robert Shiller. From him, I learned how incentives play into risk management and other behavioral finance principles. I was challenged to think beyond simplified assumptions. That short course reinforced my interest in understanding how people behave differently under risks and uncertainty and confirmed my decision to further pursue economics. 

This motivational spark started to influence how I worked with others and by myself. I put my pride aside and asked for help from teachers, and stopped waiting until 11:59 to get my work done. I made schedules and plans to be more efficient in and out of the classroom. In a recent project, I took the lead to coordinate group members in a way that we could capitalize on everyone's strengths and minimize our overall weaknessess. I realized that these seemingly small shifts have a large impact on how I learn and work with others. 

Texas Tech has been important in helping me develop as a person and a student. I've had the pleasure of meeting supportive peers and professors who helped guide me through challenging coursework and building discipline. I've learned many new things, however as my academic interests became more focused, I felt ready for an environment that would push me further rather than allow me to settle.  

At the University of Texas, I look forward to taking unique classes, such as Business Strategy ECO 352K, and learning to develop skills I can use in a future career. Additionally I am most excited to talk to organizations such as the Asian Business Student Association, where I can learn from people who have similar backgrounds as me and can help push me in the right direction.  

Each time I’ve toured the Forty Acres, I’ve felt a sense of belonging that extends beyond the campus. The community feels personal in a way I haven’t experienced in Lubbock, and being closer to Houston matters to me because family is central to my life. As a transfer student, I aim to pursue a deeper personal and professional relationship with economics as well as bring a unique perspective to the classroom.

maybe the connection was real. Maybe that’s why we can’t be friends. Maybe that’s why you wouldn’t be able to bear to have a coffee with me or a meal with me. Maybe you wouldn’t be able to just say hi and have a polite hug. Maybe it was all or nothing and that’s why you avoided seeing me. Idk.

all i know is you are haunting my dreams. You and those freaking blue eyes. The bear hugs. The smile. Ugh.

im married. I’m Ugh. Why don’t the conscience and subconscience align. I chose this. I chose this marriage. In all the imperfections. I chose escape. I chose escape from the life I was living. The Christian parents that gave me curfews and rules and wouldn’t let me even move out. i couldn’t live thee any longer and it seemed like love. It seemed like the fairytail dream. He wanted me. He showed up For me. So i chose him. I didn’t know it would turn into this. I tried so hard to be the person he wanted to be but i can’t. I have to be myself and not someone I’m not. He knows who i am. 

its not Perfect. It’s never been. I tried really tried. And he takes and takes. I put my foot down. I made boundaries and he becomes a victim. So we scurry to own sides of the house. We pretend things are good. After all, Grandma wouldnt approve of divorce. But he would. He would leave in an instant if he had an out. I know it. He’s all but said it. He told me. He would rather sleep in the car than deal with me and the truth. So we pretend. We pretend it’s love. It’s love. But it’s not the kind of love romance movies are built on. Its friend love. theres no intimacy or romance. It’s grey. It’s shallow. It’s cold.

We could pretend we actually dance in the kitchen, smile, chat and have good conversations, work along side eachother to build a life. But we don’t. You don’t want to dance with me. You don’t want to make memories. You don’t care. You don’t celebrate me, us, the kids, our wins. Nothing.

this is becoming a really hard life to live. A lonely one. maybe that’s why i keep thinking of blue eyes from a lifetime ago. Maybe that’s why i keep having this reoccurring dream of going on a date with blue eyes at a restaurant overlooking the ocean… a restaurant idk if it even exists. It’s just another figment of my imagination. 

loneliness. The real silent killer. Killing me slowly on the inside. Sad thing is i know im not the only one. But no one wants to admit it. If they did we could all get the lonely people together and be less lonely. Maybe we could even find some temporary happiness and joy. 

where are you joy?

I was born and raised in a super strict, hyper-religious, southern Baptist household with two parents that were extremely racist and homophobic.

Think of your stereotypical “God, guns, Jesus, country, Bible” hicks. That’s my whole family. 

I used to be racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, and an extremely narrowminded MAGA nationalist. I was intolerant of anything or anyone not like me. I was this way all the way until my early 20s.

In my early 20s, I began to read more and I began to actually question everything I had been brought up to believe. This was mostly due to seeing people online trashing everything I was raised to believe was right. I read a lot of compelling arguments against religion, racism, and every other gross personal belief I held. Yet, cognitive bias allowed me to push it out of my mind until I could push no more.

I figured we both cannot be correct, so I told myself I’m going to be as unbiased as I can and research this thoroughly.

After about three years of reading articles, books, research papers, and historical literature, hell, even watching YouTubers who I’d avoided for years because I didn’t want my echo chamber ruined, I came out the other side a left-leaning, empathetic atheist who is no longer racist, homophobic, xenophobic, or transphobic. 

All that is great, except for one of my closest friend in the world is still a dyed-in-the-wool Trump supporter, who is overtly racist, homophobic, xenophobic, transphobic. It is almost like looking in the past at my former self. I detest his personality, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t still love the guy.

It’s also worth mentioning I think he has caught on to my transformation. We’ve grown much more distant in the past five or six years and I feel like it’s doing neither of us any good.

I feel like I should grab a coffee with him and just explain my growth as a person, my new personal beliefs, and how I think we are incompatible as friends and how I would like to just discontinue any contact.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Bored as all living hell. I’m traveling through deep space with a group who specialize in transporting goods or people to wherever they need to be, aboard a transport vessel whose greatest achievement is proving that time can crawl. My job is ship maintenance. Sometimes I check on cargo. Sometimes I babysit passengers. But once in a blue moon we actually get to do something interesting. 

Most of the time, it’s just slowly drifting through space long enough that you start wondering if dying of old age counts as an occupational hazard. I’m writing down some stuff to pass the time on this damn ship. I hope these will be somewhat interesting to you. They’re not as cool or exciting as some of the other spacecraft going around. But hey, you found these entries, so I’m guessing you’re desperate for something. So let me tell you a little bit about a time on The Rust Star Boat, or RSB for short.


So no shit, there I was on the RSB, peacefully asleep, enjoying one of the few times I have to myself when suddenly the peaceful moment was ruined.


“Fornax! Fornax! Wake up!” Comet said, rocking me back and forth. “I need your help with the engine. You have got to show me how the energy converter works, and you need to do it in a way that I can actually understand this time!” I don’t understand how she can wake up this early every time to nag me. I’m wondering if she even sleeps at this point.


I groan from not getting enough sleep from this constant torment and brush her away.
“You’re not going to get breakfast if you keep sleeping in!” Even though there’s no sleep schedule we need to follow, if you want food, you have to show up on time if you want it hot and ready. I reluctantly rolled out of bed for food. Comet skipped ahead of me to the kitchen, where everyone else was waiting.


This is Comet, our other engineer. I don’t know why we have two engineers when she doesn’t even know how to do her job. Comet is a complete novice who barely passed school and just jumped aboard when she could. I make sure she doesn’t destroy the ship, but she’s not bad at everything else. She’s good at cleaning, cooking, and passenger care. She’s fine around weaponry if needed. Just... she’s so adamant about wanting to be an engineer and pesters me to teach her to become a master. So basically, never gonna happen. But she’s sweet, besides waking me up way too early to work on the same part I already fixed.


“Mornin’, Fornax. How’d you sleep?” the captain said with a mouth full of eggs.
This is Captain Macross. The captain is a large, muscular, cheerful guy. Probably the only person out there who can run this slow ship and not make it a living hell. He’s caring, considerate, can make everyone laugh, and surprisingly smart when it comes down to it. If it wasn’t for the little box we’re stuck in, I’d be more than happy to have him as a captain on literally any other ship. He’s just a bit too loud and tall to fly around in this box.


Next to him drinking coffee is Icarus. He doesn’t have a real title besides Captain Macross’s right-hand man, but he mostly manages the supplies on the ship. A perfectionist, but he gets the job done. He’s tall, skinny, no muscles, looks like he’ll snap in half standing next to the large captain. He’s almost the direct opposite of the captain: too serious, doesn’t talk much, comes off as rude. But there’s a reason he’s the captain’s right-hand man. They’re like brothers who trust and care for each other. Icarus could learn to not be a jackass every once in a while.


“Poorly. Why is breakfast at an ungodly hour?” I said, getting some coffee.


There’s me, Fornax. Not much more to say from what I told you earlier. I’m an engineer who can’t afford to leave and find a better gig. Not my first space trip with a bunch of weird faces, and certainly not my last for a good long while.


“Because the chef said so!” Comet said while making me a plate, then handing it to me. I hate how everyone just accepts this cruel abuse of power, but I also really hate how good a cook Comet is. I never really care for home made food, I can basically live off the nutritional gel. Having said that, putting Comet on cooking duty makes me reluctant to go back to that job.


“What are you planning to do today, Fornax?” the captain said with his mouth still full of food.


“Depends. Does the ship still need fixing, or are we getting a new one?” I said before taking a sip of coffee. The captain burst out in a fit of laughter, spewing spit and tiny bits of food on the table.


“HA! You sure know how to make a good joke, Fornax! I’d take it you’ve been spending most of your time in the engine room. We’ll come getcha if we reach our destination or need something else fixed!”


“Noted.” I got up to take my plate to the sink.


“Oh, here. Give that to me.” Comet said, washing the dishes.


“Thanks.”


“But don’t leave just yet. I want to join you on our way down into the heart of the RSB!”


“Ok.” I left and started heading to the engine room. The lights flickered on my way down, another problem I’ll fix later. Reaching my other room with how long it takes to make sure the old stupid thing doesn’t fall apart on us. But I do enjoy peacefully working on machines by myself. I’ve been working with metal and machines my whole life, but it never fails to put me at ease. I’d enjoy my brief moment of calm and joy before I heard small footsteps running down the hall.


“Fornax! I told you not to leave without me!” Comet yelled when she entered the room.


“Huh? Oh, sorry. My brain doesn’t work that well without my 8 hours of sleep.”


“Aww! I’ve missed so much valuable info. I’ll never get anywhere at this pace.” Comet said, It’s odd how she likes all of this stuff and can name what they are, but tinkering or fixing them is out of the question.


Most of the day was me fixing the ship and trying my damndest to find ways to have Comet do anything that doesn’t damage the ship, then go fix the problems she somehow manages to cause. This went on for a little bit until Pavo’s voice rang out from the speaker.


“Fornax, head on up to the control room.” The captain probably needed something, so I told Comet not to touch anything and made my way there. Arriving at the cramped control room with Pavo plugged in and the captain waiting for me.


I should mention Pavo real quick, our Intelligent Construct assigned to the RSB. This hunk of metal is the pilot of the ship and helps maintain life support, a handy fellow who doesn’t take up too much space. He mostly stays docked in the charging port by the controls and can communicate through the comms throughout the ship. This helps us with our limited space, and with his low battery life. Pavo is an ancient model. I’m really surprised that the captain and Icarus would keep such an old thing with them. But despite needing to be plugged in and being the second-most-needed thing for repairs, it’s nice to have a reliable construct on the ship. Even if he can be a bit blunt at times, I still trust him more than most flesh-and-bones I know.


“Need something, captain?”


“Ah, there you are, Fornax. We got a problem with the radar. Pavo said he saw something, but it died out before he could check what it was. We need you to fix it and see if something’s out there.”


“Sure thing, boss.” One good thing about this ship is that it’s really not too hard to fix. With newer ships and the latest and greatest stuff, you need to learn all the new equipment and all the difficult ins and outs on the go. It’s nice to not worry about that and just fix things you already know.


“There you go. It should be fine now.” We all looked at the screen to see if anything was still out there. And damn, something was.


“Huh? What was that?” I said, looking up at the screen. There was a second where the radar was showing something, but it left before anyone could identify what it was.


“Yeah, this can’t be good. I’m hoping it was just some debris floating past us.”


“And what do you think it really is? Our luck doesn’t account for junk moving past us and not damaging the exterior.”


“Hmmm. Pavo, are you picking anything up from motion sensors?”


“Negative, Captain. No signs of movement or life outside the ship.”


“It’s never too late to say that we just saw a glitch on the screen.”


“I still don’t like the look of this. Pavo, keep all systems running for any movement or interference and report back to me for any updates. Fornax, you’re with me until we regroup with everyone els—” Suddenly, the whole room went dark. No flickering, no dimming, just sudden darkness. It wasn’t the usual power outage, I’ve dealt with that plenty of times to know this was something else.


“The light? Captain, do you think this has to do with the thing outside, or wanna bet that this is Comet’s doing?” It took a second, but my eyes adjusted to see the captain looking around the room.


“Let’s stick to the plan for now. Pavo, are you ok?”


“My connection to the ship has not been compromised. Only the lights have been affected, and I cannot turn them on myself.” Small colorful lights could still be seen all around us.


“All systems are running but not the lights? Why?.... Wait, Captain! I think we’re dealing with Wraiths!”


“Yeah, but this seems like a small bunch. They don’t live out here in this region with this many planets close by. They might be some wanderers, or they got caught in some kind of dark matter expansion.”


“There’re still Wraiths, and our equipment is on the other side of the ship.”


“Then let’s go over there and get rid of this infestation! Pavo, just like I said, keep me updated on anything and everything on this ship!”


“Yes sir, Captain.”


“Good. Fornax.” The captain took two flashlights from a little box and handed one to me. “Let’s go find the others.”


The captain and I walked down the quiet, dark hallway of the ship. It’s surprising how scary a place can get with no lights and entities that can kill you floating about.


“Where is Icarus? In the loading bay?”


“Yep, that’s where I last saw him before Pavo called me up—which is why we’re going there first. As you know, the loading bay has the least protective walls against beings like Wraiths. This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls for our cargo and an easy way to let unwanted guests in. I want to check on Comet, but if she’s still holed up with the engine, then she’s in the safest place on the ship. Icarus could be in danger right now. We need to find him along with our Wraith-repellent!” Can’t argue with that logic. Off we went to save Icarus—or so we thought, until not long after, we heard Comet screaming down the other hallway.


“Comet? Guess she’s not fine.”


“Come on! We need to save her. She doesn’t know what we’re dealing with!” the captain said, running to the engine room. I followed right behind him.


“Wait! What about our stuff? We’re unarmed, even if they’re smaller than usual.”


The captain looked at me with a grin, “That’s why I brought these flashlights! They hate light, and these bad boys come with an ultra-bright setting that will either stun or scare away our ghastly friends. Got them on sale, to boot!”


“This is probably the only time your bad spending habits actually paid off!” We continued to run, then stopped at the corner right before the engine room.


“On my mark, we’ll set our lights to max and scare away the Wraiths and save Comet. Ready? 1… 2… 3!” Both of us jumped out, pointing our extremely bright flashlights forward to scare someone else we didn’t intend to.


“AH! Guys, stop! It’s too much light!” It was Comet, covering her eyes, perfectly fine.


“Comet! We thought you were being attacked by Wraiths !” the captain said while pointing his flashlight away.


“Wraiths? What’s that?” Comet said, rubbing her eyes.


“Wait, hold up. If you don’t know what Wraiths are, then why were you screaming?”


“Oh, well, you see—when you left, I thought it would be a fun challenge to blindfold myself and try to screw in some bolts. I thought I was doing a good job, so I took off the blindfold with the room totally dark, so I screamed thinking I was going blind. But it turns out the power went out, and you guys are here, so it’s all good now!”


“Well, I’m glad to see you’re alright. Can’t have a young star like you getting hurt.”


“Ugh. First off, don’t do that again. Second, we should go find Icarus. Comet, you stay here with as much light as possible.” I said putting away some of the tools Comet left out.


“What about you two? You still haven’t told me what’s going on and what this Wraiths thing is.”


“We’ll tell you later. Right now, me and the captain need to head to the loading bay and hopefully find Icarus before. Click…. click, click. Click click click click. What? Is it broken? No, it’s out of power. Captain, how’s your flashlight?”


“Well, mine is. Click……. Huh? Click, click, click. Oh, that’s why they were on sale. The extra-bright mode uses up all the current juice in the lights, so it’s a one-time thing. Kinda forgot about that.” The captain said, tossing the dead flashlight to the side.


“Great. One of our crewmates is missing, there are Wraiths aboard, we don’t have anything to even cause a distraction, and we don’t have any spare batteries for the dumb flashlight that you just had to buy. Man, I’m getting another headache.”


“Don’t worry, Fornax.” Comet put her hand on my back. “I’m sure you can figure something out.” The captain put his hand on my shoulder with the same message in his eyes.


“Ugh. We’ll just use some weaker light until we find our stuff. Comet still stays and hides for now, we’ll find you when all of this is over.”


“Fornax is right. You’re too inexperienced in this kind of stuff. It would help us a lot if you’re in a safe spot so we don’t have to worry about more than one crewmate in trouble.”


“Yes, Captain.” Comet went off into the back of the engine room and collected every light that wasn’t bolted to the room.


“So, about that other light.” The captain said, leaning towards me.


“Huh? Oh, yeah. I have a small flashlight on me—only one, so we’re going to have to share.” I pulled out my own flashlight. I kinda forgot I had it in my utility belt until I was shown that the ones the captain bought were utter dog shit.


“Fine by me. Let’s go find Icarus!” The captain slapped my back and pushed me along to the front. Holding onto the flashlight, we made our way through the dark ship yet again.
Another way to tell if a spaceship is boarded by Wraiths—besides the lights—is how fucking cold it will get. I’ve heard that some unlucky ships encounter a massive horde of really old Wraiths and completely freeze over the whole ship, killing everyone and everything aboard. I haven’t seen any proof of this happening, but I’m not interested in finding out. All I know is that they don’t kill outright, just that their existence could kill someone just by being too close to one.


It didn’t take long for me to see my own breath and start shivering. The captain’s fine with all the muscle mass he has to keep himself warm.


“I’ve been telling ya to put on some more weight. Muscles aren’t only meant to move heavy stuff around.”


“Y-yeah, b-but someone needs t-to keep this damn ship in one p-piece! I-I don’t have time t-to work out l-like some p-people!” Breathing into my hands to no avail, we continued on slowly so we didn’t stumble into a face full of cold death.


The silence was killing me. I could only hear my teeth chattering and my footsteps as we made our way through the ship.


“C-captain, d-don’t you have s-something ins-spiring to sa—?” I turned to the captain, but he wasn’t there. I looked back to see that I was all alone, feeling the temperature dropping as I realized that I’m all alone. I quickened my pace while holding out a metal rod I found in front of me. If the metal starts to freeze over, I’ll at least have some chance to save my ass. I started to run as I saw the loading bay door just up ahead. The metal in the floor and walls was creaking and shifting from the extreme cold, breathing became harder as they began to freeze over, my finger felt like falling off but I held on desperately to both the flashlight and rod. Besides being really cold, this wasn’t the worst. Which was my last normal thought till everything started to slow down as I remembered what the captain said earlier: “This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls for our cargo and an easy way to let unwanted guests in.” Meaning I didn’t have any way to react to the metal rod I was holding getting completely frozen over on its side.


I jolted awake, feeling my eyelashes breaking apart from being frozen over. Peeling my face and then body off the floor, I felt numb and heavy. Thankfully, I dropped the piece of metal before I lost my hand to the cold with it. Some snot and mucus were frozen on my face, but I ignored it along with the lights now back on as I made my way towards the loading bay, with the captain’s back blocking the way.


“C-... Captain?! Wh-where were y-you?! I-I-I think a Wraith brushed past m-me, a-and how are t-the lights back on?! And for the l-love of god, what are you doing just standing ther—!” I grabbed the captain by the shoulder and moved him to the side to see Icarus on the floor. He was completely pale with frostbite all over the exposed skin, blue lips and fingers. There’s even a pool of spit running down to the floor that was completely frozen. His eyes were open, but the mucus on the eyes were also frozen to ice. Some parts of his clothes had some small patches of frost coating it, some of it continued to the floor where he fell. There was a small patch of blood from the fall, but that too was frozen solid before it had the chance to seep out.


“H-how long do you think he’s been like this?” I said, rubbing my hands together.


“Welp, hard to say. Just got here myself, poor bud.” We both looked down at the dead man who lay frozen before us for a few seconds. “But the lights came back on. Pavo called us up when he noticed that the Wraiths were leaving. You were probably too scared to hear anything, huh?” the captain said, poking me in the arm.


“Haha, very funny. So no more Wraiths?”


“That’s what Pavo said, but those ghostly bastards did a number on my ship! It’s going to take forever to get rid of all the ice!” 


“God damnit!  And here I thought I was finally making progress. So, you’re going to put him in the revive chamber? We really haven’t cleaned it out that well.”


“Yeah,” The captain said, reaching down to put Icarus over his shoulder. “but I can't have my right-hand man sleeping on the job! You know that we can’t sleep on the job even if we’re dead! Shouldn’t take too long for him to wake up.”


“And you’re still against telling Comet about it? It’s supposed to be basic 101 space travel knowledge so the whole crew doesn’t get wiped out in situations like this!”


“Yeah, but I just don’t think she can handle that topic just yet. You’ve seen how sad she gets when some random bozo dies in the daily news report. How do you think she’ll react to this kind of tech? Let alone some of the backwards stuff our employers pull? Some time is in order to prepare her for this position she chose, and we should ease her into it. She’s just a kid, Fornax. There’s no rush to turn her into a corporate slave just yet.” The captain said, taking Icarus into the revive station near the cockpit.


“You’re the boss. I just hope this decision doesn’t leave us all dead in space. I need a drink.”


And there you go, a normal day you can expect here on the RSB. Nothing too crazy, if you asked me. I had to ask Pavo about this time because I forgot most of the details, and he recommended this little moment when I was having a hard time picking one out. I’d say it’s ok to show you what goes on in our daily lives, besides long stretches of nothing and working. The lesson of the story is never buy cheap flashlights, not worth it when nearly freezing to death. Let me know if you guys would like to hear more stuff from our adventures. I’m sure Pavo has plenty backed up in the ship’s files. I enjoyed taking a break from the usual. I just hope it didn’t bore you to death.

I went straight back to ChatGPT which to be honest is not as good as I remembered.  Later after the rage subsided, I went back to using Gemini, grok and ChatGPT rarely. 

I have been using “Fast” model and I don’t find it to be much if at all worse than pro. And since I don’t have to wait long it is a better experience than when I paid and used pro each time… lol

But I wonder - are there some cases when normal stuff would be better analyzed by pro? I kinda wish it just had an auto option where the correct model was chosen. 

Still, are there any ways I would benefit from the pro subscription? I can get it relatively cheap @ $10 per month to for my whole family through Verizon Fios perks.. so the cost isn’t much. Just not sure what it would actually do for me that free doesn’t. ",1,1769222687.0,GeminiAI,9,1.0,False
1qlb1sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1qlb1sp/daily_notes_of_a_boring_space_adventure/,Daily Notes of a Boring Space Adventure,"Hey, how's it going? Good? I hope so. Me? Bored as all living hell. I’m traveling through deep space with a group who specialize in transporting goods or people to wherever they need to be, aboard a transport vessel whose greatest achievement is proving that time can crawl. My job is ship maintenance. Sometimes I check on cargo. Sometimes I babysit passengers. But once in a blue moon we actually get to do something interesting. 

Most of the time, it’s just slowly drifting through space long enough that you start wondering if dying of old age counts as an occupational hazard. I’m writing down some stuff to pass the time on this damn ship. I hope these will be somewhat interesting to you. They’re not as cool or exciting as some of the other spacecraft going around. But hey, you found these entries, so I’m guessing you’re desperate for something. So let me tell you a little bit about a time on The Rust Star Boat, or RSB for short.


So no shit, there I was on the RSB, peacefully asleep, enjoying one of the few times I have to myself when suddenly the peaceful moment was ruined.


“Fornax! Fornax! Wake up!” Comet said, rocking me back and forth. “I need your help with the engine. You have got to show me how the energy converter works, and you need to do it in a way that I can actually understand this time!” I don’t understand how she can wake up this early every time to nag me. I’m wondering if she even sleeps at this point.


I groan from not getting enough sleep from this constant torment and brush her away.
“You’re not going to get breakfast if you keep sleeping in!” Even though there’s no sleep schedule we need to follow, if you want food, you have to show up on time if you want it hot and ready. I reluctantly rolled out of bed for food. Comet skipped ahead of me to the kitchen, where everyone else was waiting.


This is Comet, our other engineer. I don’t know why we have two engineers when she doesn’t even know how to do her job. Comet is a complete novice who barely passed school and just jumped aboard when she could. I make sure she doesn’t destroy the ship, but she’s not bad at everything else. She’s good at cleaning, cooking, and passenger care. She’s fine around weaponry if needed. Just... she’s so adamant about wanting to be an engineer and pesters me to teach her to become a master. So basically, never gonna happen. But she’s sweet, besides waking me up way too early to work on the same part I already fixed.


“Mornin’, Fornax. How’d you sleep?” the captain said with a mouth full of eggs.
This is Captain Macross. The captain is a large, muscular, cheerful guy. Probably the only person out there who can run this slow ship and not make it a living hell. He’s caring, considerate, can make everyone laugh, and surprisingly smart when it comes down to it. If it wasn’t for the little box we’re stuck in, I’d be more than happy to have him as a captain on literally any other ship. He’s just a bit too loud and tall to fly around in this box.


Next to him drinking coffee is Icarus. He doesn’t have a real title besides Captain Macross’s right-hand man, but he mostly manages the supplies on the ship. A perfectionist, but he gets the job done. He’s tall, skinny, no muscles, looks like he’ll snap in half standing next to the large captain. He’s almost the direct opposite of the captain: too serious, doesn’t talk much, comes off as rude. But there’s a reason he’s the captain’s right-hand man. They’re like brothers who trust and care for each other. Icarus could learn to not be a jackass every once in a while.


“Poorly. Why is breakfast at an ungodly hour?” I said, getting some coffee.


There’s me, Fornax. Not much more to say from what I told you earlier. I’m an engineer who can’t afford to leave and find a better gig. Not my first space trip with a bunch of weird faces, and certainly not my last for a good long while.


“Because the chef said so!” Comet said while making me a plate, then handing it to me. I hate how everyone just accepts this cruel abuse of power, but I also really hate how good a cook Comet is. I never really care for home made food, I can basically live off the nutritional gel. Having said that, putting Comet on cooking duty makes me reluctant to go back to that job.


“What are you planning to do today, Fornax?” the captain said with his mouth still full of food.


“Depends. Does the ship still need fixing, or are we getting a new one?” I said before taking a sip of coffee. The captain burst out in a fit of laughter, spewing spit and tiny bits of food on the table.


“HA! You sure know how to make a good joke, Fornax! I’d take it you’ve been spending most of your time in the engine room. We’ll come getcha if we reach our destination or need something else fixed!”


“Noted.” I got up to take my plate to the sink.


“Oh, here. Give that to me.” Comet said, washing the dishes.


“Thanks.”


“But don’t leave just yet. I want to join you on our way down into the heart of the RSB!”


“Ok.” I left and started heading to the engine room. The lights flickered on my way down, another problem I’ll fix later. Reaching my other room with how long it takes to make sure the old stupid thing doesn’t fall apart on us. But I do enjoy peacefully working on machines by myself. I’ve been working with metal and machines my whole life, but it never fails to put me at ease. I’d enjoy my brief moment of calm and joy before I heard small footsteps running down the hall.


“Fornax! I told you not to leave without me!” Comet yelled when she entered the room.


“Huh? Oh, sorry. My brain doesn’t work that well without my 8 hours of sleep.”


“Aww! I’ve missed so much valuable info. I’ll never get anywhere at this pace.” Comet said, It’s odd how she likes all of this stuff and can name what they are, but tinkering or fixing them is out of the question.


Most of the day was me fixing the ship and trying my damndest to find ways to have Comet do anything that doesn’t damage the ship, then go fix the problems she somehow manages to cause. This went on for a little bit until Pavo’s voice rang out from the speaker.


“Fornax, head on up to the control room.” The captain probably needed something, so I told Comet not to touch anything and made my way there. Arriving at the cramped control room with Pavo plugged in and the captain waiting for me.


I should mention Pavo real quick, our Intelligent Construct assigned to the RSB. This hunk of metal is the pilot of the ship and helps maintain life support, a handy fellow who doesn’t take up too much space. He mostly stays docked in the charging port by the controls and can communicate through the comms throughout the ship. This helps us with our limited space, and with his low battery life. Pavo is an ancient model. I’m really surprised that the captain and Icarus would keep such an old thing with them. But despite needing to be plugged in and being the second-most-needed thing for repairs, it’s nice to have a reliable construct on the ship. Even if he can be a bit blunt at times, I still trust him more than most flesh-and-bones I know.


“Need something, captain?”


“Ah, there you are, Fornax. We got a problem with the radar. Pavo said he saw something, but it died out before he could check what it was. We need you to fix it and see if something’s out there.”


“Sure thing, boss.” One good thing about this ship is that it’s really not too hard to fix. With newer ships and the latest and greatest stuff, you need to learn all the new equipment and all the difficult ins and outs on the go. It’s nice to not worry about that and just fix things you already know.


“There you go. It should be fine now.” We all looked at the screen to see if anything was still out there. And damn, something was.


“Huh? What was that?” I said, looking up at the screen. There was a second where the radar was showing something, but it left before anyone could identify what it was.


“Yeah, this can’t be good. I’m hoping it was just some debris floating past us.”


“And what do you think it really is? Our luck doesn’t account for junk moving past us and not damaging the exterior.”


“Hmmm. Pavo, are you picking anything up from motion sensors?”


“Negative, Captain. No signs of movement or life outside the ship.”


“It’s never too late to say that we just saw a glitch on the screen.”


“I still don’t like the look of this. Pavo, keep all systems running for any movement or interference and report back to me for any updates. Fornax, you’re with me until we regroup with everyone els—” Suddenly, the whole room went dark. No flickering, no dimming, just sudden darkness. It wasn’t the usual power outage, I’ve dealt with that plenty of times to know this was something else.


“The light? Captain, do you think this has to do with the thing outside, or wanna bet that this is Comet’s doing?” It took a second, but my eyes adjusted to see the captain looking around the room.


“Let’s stick to the plan for now. Pavo, are you ok?”


“My connection to the ship has not been compromised. Only the lights have been affected, and I cannot turn them on myself.” Small colorful lights could still be seen all around us.


“All systems are running but not the lights? Why?.... Wait, Captain! I think we’re dealing with Wraiths!”


“Yeah, but this seems like a small bunch. They don’t live out here in this region with this many planets close by. They might be some wanderers, or they got caught in some kind of dark matter expansion.”


“There’re still Wraiths, and our equipment is on the other side of the ship.”


“Then let’s go over there and get rid of this infestation! Pavo, just like I said, keep me updated on anything and everything on this ship!”


“Yes sir, Captain.”


“Good. Fornax.” The captain took two flashlights from a little box and handed one to me. “Let’s go find the others.”


The captain and I walked down the quiet, dark hallway of the ship. It’s surprising how scary a place can get with no lights and entities that can kill you floating about.


“Where is Icarus? In the loading bay?”


“Yep, that’s where I last saw him before Pavo called me up—which is why we’re going there first. As you know, the loading bay has the least protective walls against beings like Wraiths. This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls for our cargo and an easy way to let unwanted guests in. I want to check on Comet, but if she’s still holed up with the engine, then she’s in the safest place on the ship. Icarus could be in danger right now. We need to find him along with our Wraith-repellent!” Can’t argue with that logic. Off we went to save Icarus—or so we thought, until not long after, we heard Comet screaming down the other hallway.


“Comet? Guess she’s not fine.”


“Come on! We need to save her. She doesn’t know what we’re dealing with!” the captain said, running to the engine room. I followed right behind him.


“Wait! What about our stuff? We’re unarmed, even if they’re smaller than usual.”


The captain looked at me with a grin, “That’s why I brought these flashlights! They hate light, and these bad boys come with an ultra-bright setting that will either stun or scare away our ghastly friends. Got them on sale, to boot!”


“This is probably the only time your bad spending habits actually paid off!” We continued to run, then stopped at the corner right before the engine room.


“On my mark, we’ll set our lights to max and scare away the Wraiths and save Comet. Ready? 1… 2… 3!” Both of us jumped out, pointing our extremely bright flashlights forward to scare someone else we didn’t intend to.


“AH! Guys, stop! It’s too much light!” It was Comet, covering her eyes, perfectly fine.


“Comet! We thought you were being attacked by Wraiths !” the captain said while pointing his flashlight away.


“Wraiths? What’s that?” Comet said, rubbing her eyes.


“Wait, hold up. If you don’t know what Wraiths are, then why were you screaming?”


“Oh, well, you see—when you left, I thought it would be a fun challenge to blindfold myself and try to screw in some bolts. I thought I was doing a good job, so I took off the blindfold with the room totally dark, so I screamed thinking I was going blind. But it turns out the power went out, and you guys are here, so it’s all good now!”


“Well, I’m glad to see you’re alright. Can’t have a young star like you getting hurt.”


“Ugh. First off, don’t do that again. Second, we should go find Icarus. Comet, you stay here with as much light as possible.” I said putting away some of the tools Comet left out.


“What about you two? You still haven’t told me what’s going on and what this Wraiths thing is.”


“We’ll tell you later. Right now, me and the captain need to head to the loading bay and hopefully find Icarus before. Click…. click, click. Click click click click. What? Is it broken? No, it’s out of power. Captain, how’s your flashlight?”


“Well, mine is. Click……. Huh? Click, click, click. Oh, that’s why they were on sale. The extra-bright mode uses up all the current juice in the lights, so it’s a one-time thing. Kinda forgot about that.” The captain said, tossing the dead flashlight to the side.


“Great. One of our crewmates is missing, there are Wraiths aboard, we don’t have anything to even cause a distraction, and we don’t have any spare batteries for the dumb flashlight that you just had to buy. Man, I’m getting another headache.”


“Don’t worry, Fornax.” Comet put her hand on my back. “I’m sure you can figure something out.” The captain put his hand on my shoulder with the same message in his eyes.


“Ugh. We’ll just use some weaker light until we find our stuff. Comet still stays and hides for now, we’ll find you when all of this is over.”


“Fornax is right. You’re too inexperienced in this kind of stuff. It would help us a lot if you’re in a safe spot so we don’t have to worry about more than one crewmate in trouble.”


“Yes, Captain.” Comet went off into the back of the engine room and collected every light that wasn’t bolted to the room.


“So, about that other light.” The captain said, leaning towards me.


“Huh? Oh, yeah. I have a small flashlight on me—only one, so we’re going to have to share.” I pulled out my own flashlight. I kinda forgot I had it in my utility belt until I was shown that the ones the captain bought were utter dog shit.


“Fine by me. Let’s go find Icarus!” The captain slapped my back and pushed me along to the front. Holding onto the flashlight, we made our way through the dark ship yet again.
Another way to tell if a spaceship is boarded by Wraiths—besides the lights—is how fucking cold it will get. I’ve heard that some unlucky ships encounter a massive horde of really old Wraiths and completely freeze over the whole ship, killing everyone and everything aboard. I haven’t seen any proof of this happening, but I’m not interested in finding out. All I know is that they don’t kill outright, just that their existence could kill someone just by being too close to one.


It didn’t take long for me to see my own breath and start shivering. The captain’s fine with all the muscle mass he has to keep himself warm.


“I’ve been telling ya to put on some more weight. Muscles aren’t only meant to move heavy stuff around.”


“Y-yeah, b-but someone needs t-to keep this damn ship in one p-piece! I-I don’t have time t-to work out l-like some p-people!” Breathing into my hands to no avail, we continued on slowly so we didn’t stumble into a face full of cold death.


The silence was killing me. I could only hear my teeth chattering and my footsteps as we made our way through the ship.


“C-captain, d-don’t you have s-something ins-spiring to sa—?” I turned to the captain, but he wasn’t there. I looked back to see that I was all alone, feeling the temperature dropping as I realized that I’m all alone. I quickened my pace while holding out a metal rod I found in front of me. If the metal starts to freeze over, I’ll at least have some chance to save my ass. I started to run as I saw the loading bay door just up ahead. The metal in the floor and walls was creaking and shifting from the extreme cold, breathing became harder as they began to freeze over, my finger felt like falling off but I held on desperately to both the flashlight and rod. Besides being really cold, this wasn’t the worst. Which was my last normal thought till everything started to slow down as I remembered what the captain said earlier: “This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls for our cargo and an easy way to let unwanted guests in.” Meaning I didn’t have any way to react to the metal rod I was holding getting completely frozen over on its side.

Some snot and mucus were frozen on my face, but I ignored it along with the lights now back on as I made my way towards the loading bay, with the captain’s back blocking the way.


“C-... Captain?! Wh-where were y-you?! I-I-I think a Wraith brushed past m-me, a-and how are t-the lights back on?! And for the l-love of god, what are you doing just standing ther—!” I grabbed the captain by the shoulder and moved him to the side to see Icarus on the floor. He was completely pale with frostbite all over the exposed skin, blue lips and fingers. There’s even a pool of spit running down to the floor that was completely frozen. His eyes were open, but the mucus on the eyes were also frozen to ice. Some parts of his clothes had some small patches of frost coating it, some of it continued to the floor where he fell. There was a small patch of blood from the fall, but that too was frozen solid before it had the chance to seep out.


“H-how long do you think he’s been like this?” I said, rubbing my hands together.


“Welp, hard to say. Just got here myself, poor bud.” We both looked down at the dead man who lay frozen before us for a few seconds. “But the lights came back on.

“That’s what Pavo said, but those ghostly bastards did a number on my ship! It’s going to take forever to get rid of all the ice!” 


“God damnit!  And here I thought I was finally making progress. So, you’re going to put him in the revive chamber? We really haven’t cleaned it out that well.”


“Yeah,” The captain said, reaching down to put Icarus over his shoulder. “but I can't have my right-hand man sleeping on the job! You know that we can’t sleep on the job even if we’re dead! Shouldn’t take too long for him to wake up.”


“And you’re still against telling Comet about it? It’s supposed to be basic 101 space travel knowledge so the whole crew doesn’t get wiped out in situations like this!”


“Yeah, but I just don’t think she can handle that topic just yet. You’ve seen how sad she gets when some random bozo dies in the daily news report. How do you think she’ll react to this kind of tech?

“Blue Dog Transports — or the BDT. Affordable, intercity bus travel. Buy your digital ticket now!”

My hand shivered as I turned it over. Against the snow, it looked wrong. Too… red.

I scrubbed until my skin burned. I scrubbed. I scrubbed and I scrubbed and I scrubbed… but it never lifted. It stayed. It stained. Why wouldn’t it come off?

I sank onto a frozen bench beneath the ill-lit canopy.

Small, unsteady clouds escaped from my lips.

A thin haze clung to the street.

My eyelids felt nearly frozen together. I forced them open, blinking through a brief blur.

When my vision cleared, he was there.

He stood just three feet in front of me, dark-skinned and poised, dressed in a deep blue suit. His polished cane caught the streetlight like something old and ceremonial.

“Why, I do declare, miss,” he said. “Did I frighten you?”

The phone fell from my hand and landed at his feet.

He knelt slowly, pinching it between long, thin fingers.

“I don’t quite understand these strange mechanics.”

“They just weigh your pants down.”

The gentleman flashed a pearly white smile, amused by his own joke.

“Go on now. Take it. I won’t bite.”

I reached for the phone, and he grabbed my crime, examining its boldness.

“Well, well, well… what do we have here?”

I wrenched myself free, snatching back the phone.

“My apologies, darlin’. Just a sight I know well.”

“You can call me Mr. Everett.” He tipped his hat. “Now, what’s a lady like you doing out here, Miss…?”

I hesitated.

“Sarah. My name is Sarah.” It felt strange in my mouth.

“Ah, Miss Sarah! What a timeless name.”

Mr. Everett stared back at me, his dapper demeanor out of place on the empty street.

“What… what are you doing out here?”

I kept my voice low.

“Why, I presume the same reason you’re here, Miss Sarah! I’ve got a place to go!”

He watched me long enough that responding felt like a mistake.

“Where are you going?”

“Oh, not too far, Miss Sarah… Whereabouts are you headed?”

The brim of his hat dipped as he studied me. Even under the streetlight, his pupils looked completely dilated.

“I… uhhh… I’m… well… I don’t know.” That wasn’t a lie. “Just far away from here.”

“Why, Miss Sarah, this city bus won’t take you too far. Not as far as you need to go, that is.”

He tapped the tip of his cane against the hardening snow.

“What you’re lookin’ for is the 1318. That ol’ thing’ll take you as far as you need to go. And I…”

Mr. Everett reached into his vest pocket.

“…just so happen to have a ticket right here.”

He extended his arm toward me, revealing a small but impressive-looking bus ticket in the palm of his hand.

It was beautiful, almost impossibly so.

Ruby-red inscriptions traced intricate designs across its golden surface.

A deep emerald border framed the red, sharp and vivid, like blood held in place, and on the stub, etched in the same emerald, were the numbers 1318.

“Just trade your ticket for mine, and we can be on our way!”

“But… how would that even work? I only have a digital ticket.”

Mr. Everett leaned closer, the brim of his hat dipping low, casting his face in shadow.

“Miss Sarah, sometimes honesty is worth far more than gold.”

His fingers flexed around the ticket, almost caressing it.

“We can do an exchange. A verbal contract.”

He straightened and held the ticket out to me.

“I’ll make sure the bus driver knows the arrangement.”

“All you need to say is, ‘What was mine is now yours.’ Say it, and we’ll have our trade. Say it, and the ticket is yours. Say it… and you’ll be on your way.”

I reached for the ticket — and for a moment, I swear I saw it throb.

Then I said the words that would seal our strange bargain:

“What was mine is now yours.”

Time stilled. Sound fell away, and it felt as if all the air had been pulled from the world.  
Mr. Everett looked at me, his eyes locked with mine as headlights flared behind his head.

“Good luck, Miss Sarah.”

He tipped his hat— and vanished.

The bus ticket drifted down in his place, catching the light as it settled on the snow.  
When I bent to pick it up, the bus doors were already open in front of me.

My foot hit the first step and I pulled myself in.

The bus was dated but clean, bathed in a sickly green-yellow light that made my eyes ache. The air smelled of burnt metal and old paper. A faint hum thrummed beneath my feet.

“Ticket, please.”

The man behind the wheel didn’t turn or blink.  
His gaze stayed fixed straight ahead, posture locked in place like he’d been molded into the seat.

I held out my ticket.

His eyes flicked once to my stained fingers—brief, exact, uninterested—before his white-gloved hand lifted the slip away.

He turned it slightly, then pressed a small device to the paper, burning an arcane pattern of intersecting triangles, before placing it back in my possession.

He faced forward again.

The triangles flickered across the paper, their corners sparking along lines I couldn’t follow.

A question hovered on my tongue, but something about the bus swallowed it.

I slid the ticket into my pocket and faced the aisle.  
Keeping my head down, I walked to the back of the bus and slipped into an empty seat in the far right corner.

I sank into it. The faint hum beneath the floor drifted into silence.

…

The screeching of brakes ripped me awake. Sweat prickled my forehead. I sat with my head against the window.

Outside, the darkness was total, as if the bus were traveling through a place left unfinished.

The doors slammed shut, and the bus lurched forward.

Someone came down the aisle, his heavy, worn coat draped over broad shoulders, a black dog slipping silently at his heels.

He halted in the aisle.

“Mind if I sit here?”

I nodded.

He eased into the seat beside me.

The four-legged companion sprang up onto his back paws, his upper body plopping into my lap.  
His eager tongue lashed at my cheeks as his claws tapped lightly on the floor.

“Cerb!”

The dog slid off my lap with a disappointed thump, then curled beside the man’s boots, letting out a soft sigh.

I shifted back in my seat.

“Sorry about that,” he said, patting his black canine on the head.  
“That there is Cerb… and I’m Pluto.”

He touched two fingers briefly to his brow, then let his hand fall back to Cerb.

“Pluto?” I wiped my face.

“That’s what they call me.”

Cerb’s ears flicked as Pluto shifted, stretching his frame between the seats before leaning back into the corner.

He settled in. His attention lingered on me.

“So,” he continued, “what brings you to these parts?”

I stared down at the floor. “I… I’m just… passing through.”

Pluto sat up, leaning the slightest bit in my direction.

“Passing through, huh? Sounds about right.”

He hooked his elbow over the back of the seat and nodded toward the rows of quiet passengers.

“You’re no different than any of them,” he said, settling back. “Everyone here comes with their own pain, their own pleasures, and their own stories.”

“And what makes you so different?”

Pluto met my eyes, something sharp and almost impressed flickering in his.

“I’m the only one who’s not running.”

Part II - Marv

Before the war, he’d been odd but harmless. A man who kept to himself, did what he was told.

Dishonorably discharged in ’69, Marv drifted through New York like a stain the city refused to claim.

One rainy night, he slept beneath a narrow awning, pressed against the slick brick wall. His jaw hung slack, the hollows in his face deepened by shadow.

In his dreams, he drifted back. Wet boots, soaked uniforms, red mud, and the metallic tang of life spilling out around him.  
There, chaos was fluent, the screams dissolved into jungle static; flesh, bone, the snap giving way.

A tickle brushed his lip, dragging him out of sleep. He spat, static clouding his gaze. A brown, bulbous mass twitched at the edge of his vision. Its yellow guts washed thin.

Marv pinched it between his fingers, smearing pale matter against his skin as he lifted it toward his mouth. He closed his eyes and bit down.

The metallic flavor spread across his tongue.

Static hissed louder as he leaned his head back and chewed, letting the sensation settle. A thick glob seeped from the corner of his mouth while his tongue moved, coated in a gritty, sticky film. Marv licked his lips.

He tore through dented trash cans in the long-abandoned alleys, tipping them over, pawing through what time had left behind. Old paper. Rusted tins. Broken things that once had purpose.  
He dug through the gaps in brickwork, the dark mouths of collapsed crates and forgotten corners, grabbing anything that skittered, buzzed, or twitched.

The sounds grounded him. The scrape of metal, the hollow thud of cans hitting concrete, the wet rustle of movement in the dark.

Warmth spread through him. Not comfort. Not relief. Heat.

Marv slumped back against the brick wall. That’s when he heard her.

“I know, I know,” she said, phone pressed to her ear. “I’m just trying to figure out where I am.”

Her heels clacked against the wet street as she drew closer. “It’s so creepy out here.”

Marv slid farther into the shadow, barely lifting his eyelids. She passed him without slowing—then stopped.

“Oh,” she murmured. “There’s a man here… sorry, sir?” She took a step closer, water splashing under her heel. “Dammit.” She lifted her foot and shook it.

When she looked up again, Marv’s eyes were open. They locked.

She understood then.

“Never mind,” she said, already backing away.

Marv lunged.

Her scream tore through the empty street, only driving him faster. She tried to run, but he caught her foot and dragged her down.

He climbed on top of her, slammed her head against the pavement once, twice, and pulled her unconscious body toward the storm drain. Her phone slipped from her fingers, its screen glowing in the puddle.

…

“They found her three months later. Marv had turned her body into a human insect farm. He harvested anything that moved. She was covered in boils, serving as his personal buffet—hers too. The medical examiner declared her DOA, but the first responders swore they saw her chewing.”

“So… what happened to Marv?”

“He was committed. When the police found them in that storm drain, he wasn’t exactly… stable.”

“Meaning?”

“He’d been living down there. He thought whatever was happening in that drain was his legacy. Called it his seed. His children. Said it gave him life.”

I felt my skin crawl. “Is he still alive?”

Pluto hung his head. “He passed recently.”

“Don’t tell me you feel sorry for him.”

“Hey now.” Pluto lifted his hands. “I’m not here to judge. And, Sarah… you really ought to respect the dead.”

Part III - Jenny

“Now, Judy, how many Pumpkin Pumps do we have left?”  
“I’m glad you asked, Janet! We only have 10,000 left in stock. And order fast because the first FIVE! THOUSAND! ORDERS!!! will get not one… but TWO!!! Pumpkin Pumps!”

Jenny lay sprawled across her mattress, surrounded by a graveyard of Hostess wrappers and Dorito crumbs.

She rolled over with a groan and landed on a fork, cake dried onto the prongs. The dull jab made her blink.

She patted blindly for the remote and shut off the TV.

A 2-liter diet soda sat on her nightstand, its cap missing. The bottle crinkled under her fingers as she took a swig. Her lips peeled from it with a sticky sound.

She rubbed her eyes and fished the clock out of the mess beside the bed.

**3:00 AM.**

Jenny rocked forward and tipped upright, grunting as she stood.

Ankles cracked like bubble wrap as she waddled toward the bathroom, pausing halfway to dig out an embedded wedgie.

Her work clothes were still on the floor from her last shift.

Jenny plopped her backpack onto the counter. It slumped open, already too full. She shoved another bag of donuts inside and dragged it off.

Wrappers and crumbs marked where the bag had been, a cream-colored envelope left behind.

She reached for it. Yellowed nails slid under the fold.

**Class of 1985**

**We are pleased to announce Bell View High’s 15-Year Class Reunion!**

**Attire: ’80s Retro**

Bell View High.

Jenny tore through her bag shoving handfuls of donuts in her mouth.

She stared at the typed invitation, chewing only once before swallowing.

*“Hey, Jenny. Is that broccoli in your pants? Or is your cellulite showing through your ass?”*

Her mind spun.

*“Hey, Jenny—do you have to pay rent for the extra square footage you take up?”*

*“And what about insurance? Hey, Jenny! Do you have to carry license and registration while operating through these hallways?”*

Her breathing grew ragged. She grabbed a diet soda and gulped it down, forcing the donut mush past the tightness in her throat.

Becky’s voice rose over the others—a singsong cadence she hadn’t heard in years.

*“Jenny, Jenny, cheap as a penny.”*

Jenny inhaled her bag of snacks.

*“Worse than a peasant. Despised like a tranny.”*

She moved to the freezer, consuming seven hand-torn pieces of frozen pizza.

*“No one will touch her, they flee at her smell.”*

Her body gave out before her mind did.

*“Be lucky you’re not her.”*

She slid down the kitchen cabinet and slumped onto the linoleum floor.

*“I’d rather choose hell.”*

Her eyes glazed. The invitation fluttered from her hand, landing a few inches from her belly.

The world began to dim around her.

Not sleep.

Not rest.

Shutting down.

A knock at the door pulled her back into consciousness.

Jenny’s eyes felt dry, as if they’d been open the whole time. Her tongue was thick. Her throat burned.

Another knock. Persistent. Polite.

The front door opened.

“Jenny?”

The voice was soft and wispy. Warm. Empty.

Mrs. Grein stepped into the kitchen in denim-styled tights and floral ballet flats, her face perfectly powdered. A short blonde pixie was fixed in place, frozen with hairspray.

Her smile was bright. Plastic.

“There you are, Jen,” she said, as if Jenny were sitting at the table instead of on the floor. She closed the door behind her.

“Jenny… shouldn’t you be at work?”

Jenny gestured toward the invitation on the floor beside the empty pizza box. Mrs. Grein followed the motion, brows lifted. Her gaze settled on the invitation.

“Ohhh,” she breathed, her voice light as cotton candy. “What’s this?” 

She bent with delicate, practiced movements and picked it up. Examined it briefly, then slowly—each syllable crisp and carefully enunciated—began to read:

“Bell… View… High…  
Fif… teen… year… re… u… nion…”

Her smile widened slightly, a brief flicker beneath the emptiness.

“Well, dear,” she said, tilting her head, “that sounds lovely.”

She set the invitation neatly on the counter, smoothing the edges with gentle fingertips, then gave one last floating smile before slipping out the door, humming a tune that wasn’t real.

Jenny stared at the counter. The invitation seemed less threatening. She pulled herself up, leaving an impression in the mess on the floor, and moved down the hall toward her parents’ old room.

The door groaned open.

A rush of crisp air brushed her stringy hair as Jenny stomped past the bed and yanked open the closet. She dug around blindly, shoving aside blankets, coats, old shoes, until her hand struck cardboard. She dragged the box out and dropped onto the floor, the bookcase rattling beside her.

Cassette tapes. Yellowed newspapers. A 1984 glam magazine. And… her old yearbook.

Jenny pulled it into her lap.

*Happy graduation, Jen! Love, Mrs. Grein*

She skimmed the pages—rows of smiling strangers. Lunch tables. Basketball games.

Then a familiar name appeared.

**Class President: Jake Donahew**

Jenny closed her eyes.

*“BEEP BEEP BEEP… GARBAGE TRUCK COMING THROUGH!”*

A shove from behind. Books scattered across the floor.

*“UH OH, TRAFFIC JAM!”*

Two boys laughed, high-fiving as they walked away.

Jenny crouched and gathered her things.

A pair of white sneakers stepped into view.

*“Forget about those jerks…”*

He knelt beside her, collecting her books.

*“You’re Jennifer, right? I’m Jake. Jake Donahew. We had… what was it… U.S. History together?”*

She looked up. Dark, clean-cut hair. Kind eyes.

He handed her the stack and smiled.

*“See you around, Jennifer.”*

The memory faded.

She stared at his picture, then reached for the old glam magazine. Glossy models. Teased bangs. Bright lipstick. Painted eyes. Neon cheeks.

**Attire: ’80s Retro**

Jenny sat stiffly on the floral loveseat while Mrs. Grein bustled around her perfectly staged living room. The yearbook and magazine lay on the coffee table.

“I want to… do this…” Jenny said, pointing at a neon-covered model on the glossy spread—

Mrs. Grein set down her teacup, then picked up the magazine with dainty excitement.

Moments later, Jenny was seated at the vanity. Mascara. Eyeshadow. Blush. Mrs. Grein’s tweezers reached for her brows. She didn’t get past the first pluck before Jenny screamed.

“Beauty is pain, dear.”

She showed her how to tease her hair. How to soften the edges. How to choose the right lipstick.

“You can have my mother’s old nightgown,” she said with a warm, distant smile. “She was quite larger than me and very broad-shouldered.”

The nightgown was satin white, with thin straps and a slit up the side. Jenny held it against herself, almost awed.

“Now all you need is an idol.” Mrs. Grein placed a hand on Jenny’s shoulder and guided her back to the vanity.

“Mine was Grace Kelly in ‘*To Catch a Thief’*.”

“I-dol?” Jenny asked, staring at herself in the mirror. For the first time, without donut crumbs or sticky soda on her lips.

“Yes, dear. Someone to look up to. Someone you can…”

Mrs. Grein stared at Jenny’s reflection, eyes empty, smile fixed.

“Someone you can mirror, dear.”

Jenny was back on her parents’ bedroom floor. Mrs. Grein’s mother’s nightgown lay smoothed out on the bed.

She went through every model in the magazine to no avail. Her yearbook followed.

The pages were sharper than expected. One of her swollen fingers snapped a page forward, slicing the tip. A blot of blood bloomed on the paper.

“Ow…” she muttered, more confused than hurt. Her yearbook lay on the floor as she sucked her finger, eyes settling on the two open pages. She read the names absently:

…Steven Spencer…  
…Todd Spencer…  
…Becky Smith…

Her heart kicked.

She stared into the black-and-white portrait. Becky’s perfect hair and white teeth smiled at her. The invitation lay beside her leg, creased and bent. Jenny reached for it, smoothing it flat.

**RSVP with Becky @** [**mrsbeckydonahew@yahoo.com**](mailto:mrsbeckydonahew@yahoo.com)

Jenny’s mind worked harder than it had in a long time.

Becky Smith.  
Jake Donahew.  
Becky Donahew.

Becky with the perfect friends.  
Becky with the perfect life.  
Becky with the perfect husband.

Jenny had found her idol..

Her parents’ bedroom filled with faces. Pages torn from magazines taped to the walls. Cutout faces of old classmates scattered across the floor. Not Becky’s.

Jenny ripped the mirror off her parents’ wooden dresser and placed it on the floor. Taping all of Becky’s yearbook photos on the glass.

Becky’s senior class portrait.  
Becky at the pep rally.  
Becky at prom.

Mrs. Grein came by with three bags of old makeup and four cans of hairspray.

“So you can find your look, dear.”

It started with practice. Mascara clumped. Blush went uneven. Eyeliner slanted and smeared.

She sat cross-legged on the floor in Mrs. Grein’s mother’s satin nightgown.

She didn’t sleep. There was no need. Week-old food lay on the counter. Chinese takeout spoiled in the fridge.

Her entire world condensed into one question:

Would Becky do this?

**July 12th 5:12 PM**

She teased her hair until the strands crackled like plastic. Then teased it more. She layered blush until her cheeks burned hot and bright. She blended blue shadow all the way to her brow bone. Then packed pink on top.

Her eyes were jaundiced from lack of sleep. Her lips were chapped from constant reapplication. Her hand shook every time she reached for something.

But her smile — the Becky smile — stayed frozen and strained, exactly like the picture.

The nightgown felt like part of her skin, stained with makeup fingerprints and stretched tight across her body. She hadn’t taken it off. In her mind, it was elegant. Transformative. Almost holy.

In the mirror, her reflection fractured. Between taped magazine pages and yearbook photos — glossy models arched in high heels, Becky’s smile caught in the glass beside her own.

The invitation slipped from her hand and drifted under the bed.

Jenny bent stiffly to reach it. The nightgown pulled tight across her hips, seams tugging as she lowered herself into a crouch.

Her fingers closed around the edge of the invitation, her knuckles lightly brushing against something beside it.

She pulled out an old shoebox, the invitation still pinched between her fingers.

Inside was a pair of church heels.

Faded yellow. Softened leather. Creases split at the toes.

The straps strained as she fastened them, flesh pressing through the opening.

The pain was immediate, sharp, and blooming.

She straightened and faced the mirror again — from the models, to Becky’s photo, to her own reflection.

Jenny stood in Mrs. Grein’s living room, her heels biting when she shifted her weight.

Mrs. Grein’s gaze moved over her without urgency.

She paused and picked up an old camera.

“Your smile is lovely, dear.”

The flash burst bright, filling the room for a single white-hot moment.

Mrs. Grein lowered the camera. Her smile lingered, soft and automatic.

“You’ve found your look.”

She opened the door, watching as Jenny stepped out into the hallway, her eyes fixed on a vague point past the doorway, unfocused, dreamy.

Jenny climbed the bus steps, gripping the rail.

The driver gave her a quick up-down glance — polite smile, empathetic eyes — before turning away.

A few riders shifted in their seats as she passed.

A small gasp near the middle.  
A muffled snicker toward the back.  
Someone whispered, “Oh… wow…” under their breath.

Jenny stared out the window, watching her reflection shift in the glass. Her fingers lifted to her hair, checking its place, then fell back to her lap.

The bus rattled and swayed. Each bump tugged at her balance, but she held herself upright, shoulders set, chin level.

Bell View High came into view — balloons tied to a folding table, music leaking into the warm air, cars lined along the curb. People moved toward the entrance laughing, bright in neon and denim and glitter.

Her heels tapped in uneven rhythm across the concrete. The gym doors stood open behind the table where a woman sat with a clipboard.

“Name?”

“J–Jenny P–purtle.”

The woman’s eyes stayed on the page.

“You’re not on the list. It’s fifty dollars to enter.”

Jenny set the invitation on the table. Damp. Wrinkled.

The woman looked up.

Her expression shifted — just enough to register — then settled again.

“You didn’t RSVP.”

Jenny tried to pass her.

“Ma’am!” The woman yelled, clipboard remaining between them.

“What’s going on?”

A voice came from nearby, unhurried.

The woman turned her head slightly.

“Mr. Donahew, she didn’t RSVP!”

Jake looked from the clipboard to Jenny.

He reached into his wallet and placed a fifty into the tin.

“That should take care of it.”

The woman exhaled and reached for a wristband. She tore it free and handed it over.

Jake took it.

“Let’s get this on you,” he said, smiling easily.

The paper band barely closed around Jenny’s wrist. He pressed it flat anyway. The edge bit into her skin. She didn’t flinch. She didn’t look down.

“Good to see you, Jennifer,” he said.  
“I hope you have a great night.”

He stepped back toward the doors and was gone.

The band tightened as her hand relaxed.

She smoothed her dress and lifted her chin.

Jake paid.  
Jake remembered.  
Jake wanted her inside.

Neon bled across the room.  
Jenny stayed close to the wall, letting bodies pass.

She looked for her.  
She looked for him.

Faces moved by.  
Glasses clinked.

Jenny ducked into the bathroom and stood at the sink, checking the damage without fixing it, smoothing the nightgown and pressing her hair back into something that would stay.

When she stepped out, Becky was at the bar with a cluster of friends pressed close enough to count as one body. 

Someone slid a glass into her hand. She tipped it back, clean and practiced, her head tilting just far enough before the glass came down again.

 Another appeared almost immediately.

Laughter moved around her in waves, rising as she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, settling as she leaned into someone’s shoulder. 

 Arms wrapped her waist. A hand found her elbow. The space around her tightened and loosened again, adjusting to her movements.

Jenny watched long enough for the motion to slow, for each small action to separate itself—the lift of the glass, the swallow, the brief pause before the next laugh.

Jenny made her way to the bar.

“S-shot.”

The first one went down hot and stayed there. The second resisted, rose, then settled. Her eyes watered. The room shifted slightly off its center. Heat moved across her face.

She stumbled toward Becky.

“Huh…hi…” she tried, but it came out soft, the word losing its shape on the way out.

“Did you see Brian? He grew up good. I don’t know why I even dumped him.”  
One of Becky’s friends swatted her arm.  
“You’re still the same, aren’t you, Beck?”

Jenny’s mouth moved before the sound did.  
“Beh—”

“And can you believe who he’s with now? Stacy. Stacy Turner. He definitely downgraded after I dumped him.”

Jenny held the Becky smile, trying to speak through lipstick-coated teeth.  
“Buh…Becky.”

Becky whipped back nearly colliding with the girl beside her. Her face twisted in disgust.

“What the— what the fuck IS that!?”

Jenny reached out.

Something surged inside her. Overflowing her stomach and rising through her esophagus like a tsunami.

A thick, chunky explosion splattered across Becky’s chest, down her dress, and onto the barstool. Hot, sour, and loud enough to cut through the music. The entire gymnasium went silent. 

Someone whispered, “Oh no…”

Someone else, “Dude—gross—”

And then a voice from the crowd:

**“YOOOO! Jenny Penny is WASTED!!”**

Laughter broke.  
Screams.  
Gags.

Becky shrieked, dragging her hands down the front of her dress, her face folding in on itself.

“You FREAK—”

Jake stepped in between them.

“Becky, stop—she didn’t mean—”

“Move, Jake!” Becky shoved him. “She ruined—”

Jake tried again.  
“Beck, seriously—she’s not—”

Becky’s hand snapped across his face.

**CRACK.**

Jake staggered back, stunned, colliding with Jenny.

Jenny folded forward as a growling sound rose from her stomach and out her mouth.

…

“Wha—what happened to her?” I asked, leaning into the aisle.

Pluto didn’t look up from the photograph in his hand.

“Who? Jenny? Her heart gave out.”

Pluto continued to study the photograph—the one of Jenny in the nightgown, hair teased, makeup cracked. Swollen feet.

He smoothed the crease with his thumb.

“Right after she… spazzed out on Becky.”

“Spazzed out?”

“Well… you know how reunions are. Old wounds. Old crushes. Old rivalries.”

He shrugged, tucking the photo into his coat.

“Sometimes people make a mess they can’t clean up.  
When Jenny came to, she saw the carnage.  
The screaming. The blood.”

“Did she… did she kill—”

Pluto’s smile sharpened.  
He looked out the window, as if admiring the endless dark.

“I’ll tell you this.”

“She earned her seat fair and square.”

1qlazxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1qlazxx/the_cigarette_case/,The Cigarette Case,"🇵🇱Gdańsk, Poland. The 90s.

Kazimierz found the cigarette case one morning on a bench as he walked his usual route through the park to the shipyard, where he worked as a painter. In the gloom, the ugly outlines of creaking cranes loomed, resembling sick birds, and the smell of dampness and rotting autumn leaves seemed to crawl directly into his soul, causing fits of melancholy.

Kazimierz looked around and, seeing no one nearby, picked up the case from the rain-soaked bench. It was silver, looked simple — without inscriptions or engravings. On the move, Kazimierz opened it and saw that it was full.

— O kurwa! — Kazimierz exclaimed with joy. — O kurwa! To dobrze!

He was genuinely happy about the find: his cigarettes had run out yesterday, and Kazimierz desperately wanted a smoke. He took out a filter cigarette with no markings, sniffed it, and, after making sure it was tobacco, lit it and took a greedy drag. His head swam, and with a sigh of relief, he exhaled the smoke, noting that the tobacco was excellent. Pleased, feeling as if on wings, Kazimierz hurried to the gate to make it to his shift on time.

The rusty wind beat against the walls of the smoking area when the crew came out for their afternoon break.

— Got a smoke, Kazimierz? — his partner Tadeusz asked, coughing terribly and spitting up yellow phlegm. — We’ll smoke mine tomorrow.

— Here, — Kazimierz said, opening the case and offering him a cigarette.

— Wow, good tobacco, — Tadeusz said, taking a drag, and again went into a fit of coughing, exhaling smoke.

— Kurwa mać, this painting work will be the end of me, I’ll cough up my lungs, — Tadeusz rasped glumly.

Kazimierz remained silent. He knew about the harm, but he continued to go to this job, as if chained, just like all the other laborers. He saw their thoughts on their faces in the morning and knew what they were thinking when they walked home from work.

The next morning, Kazimierz, as always, woke up earlier than anyone else and left while his son and wife were still asleep. Coffee and a cigarette on an empty stomach were his loyal morning friends. And, opening the case, he saw that it was full again.

— Matko Boska!, that can’t be! — Kazimierz exclaimed and began to carefully examine the case and the cigarettes. Nothing unusual. But he couldn’t believe his eyes and tore up one cigarette: it looked like tobacco, good tobacco, and the smell was right.

— Fine, — he said, snapping the case shut and finding no explanation for what had happened. He lit up, sipping his coffee, looking out the window, and thinking about the miracles that still happen in this world.

So several days passed, and every morning the case was full. Kazimierz, offering the foreman a cigarette in the morning, asked about Tadeusz.

— I called his wife, Agnieszka, last night, — the foreman replied. — She said he died. First, he started throwing up blood, and then he coughed up his lungs into the sink. The ambulance didn’t make it.

— Jezu Chryste… — Kazimierz whispered, his blood running cold, and stepped away. He understood that the case was the cause. The very one from which he had been handing out cigarettes left and right. “Who’s next?” — Kazimierz thought with horror. After smoking down to the filter and burning his fingers, he immediately lit the next one.

— Heard the news, Kazimierz? — the workers asked in the smoking area.

— What news? — he asked, growing cold inside.

— Waldek, our grinder, died. He choked on phlegm in his sleep. How did he manage that?..

Kazimierz shrugged indifferently and, without another word, went back to work.

Over the next few months, a series of accidents and fatal illnesses wiped out almost the entire old crew of their shift. Only Kazimierz and a few other guys who didn’t smoke were left. Just yesterday, after work, when Kazimierz offered a cigarette to a new guy, the man died in a crash, his head hitting the dash as his car swerved into oncoming traffic. The cause of the accident was a cigarette that had fallen onto the seat.

Maybe the cigarette case wasn’t forgotten or lost, but left there on purpose? Maybe someone before couldn’t bear the weight and got rid of it that way?

These thoughts swirled in Kazimierz’s head as he stood early in the morning in that same gloomy park at the familiar bench. He thought: it’s time to leave it, to throw it away for good, enough!

At the same time, he rationalized it to himself: now he was more careful — he only offered cigarettes from the case to random passersby. For his own, he had a regular pack.

— Tomorrow… I’ll throw it away tomorrow, — Kazimierz promised himself and hurried to work, knowing deep down that this “tomorrow” would never come.

That night, his son woke up, needing to use the toilet. Returning, he noticed the edge of the cigarette case sticking out of his father’s jacket pocket. Listening — everyone was asleep — he quietly and carefully pulled out two cigarettes for himself and a friend.

“Well, even if Dad notices, what’s he gonna do? Spank me?” — the boy thought.

The table top was filled with cups of coffee and soda. Along with a dozen or so takeout boxes. 

The young man was wearing dark headphones with red cuffs. 

"" On your back! "" The man yelled into the headphones. He furiously smashed the buttons of the keyboard. 

In the screen, the character he was playing moved to behind a tree and was peaking the surroundings. 

"" This game is mine"" The man said while grining, his forehead furrowed. 

Suddenly his character got headshoted from far away. 

"" F\*ck!!!!! Where the hell was that player!!! "" He yelled angrily while his expression turned ugly. 

Crack!

He suddenly unplugged his keyboard and threw it hard on the floor. Some of the keys broke and the keyboard itself cracked in two, making a loud crack sound. 

Screech! 

A harsh rasp echoed through the room as he pushed back from the desk. 

Thump! Thump! Thump! 

He continued to stomp the broken keyboard. 

As he stomped the sharp sound of stomping and rattles filled the room. 

The small pieces of of plastic and metal scattered as the keyboard become just a scrap of metal. 

The man continued to stomp his foot on the keyboard relentlessly. His hands clenched into fists and nails digging into his palm. 

Huff! Huff! Huff! 

After a minute of stomping non stop he finally stopped. He took huge breaths of the cold air in the room, as his ragged breathing slowly began to even out. his forehead was almost shiny with sweat. 

 

Thud! 

He sat back on his chair with a dhup.

"" I need some soda"" He grumbled softly while opening his phone. 

The phone showed the time was 1 am. He tried to order takeout but he saw the restaurant wasn't accepting deliveries. 

"" Damn! I have to go get it myself now! "" He grumbled in annoyance with his forehead furrowing deeper. 

He started blankly at the computer screen, which now said lost. He neither lashed out nor started another match. 

A moment later he got up from his chair once again. 

A screech echoed through the room as he got up from his chair. 

He turned off the computer without even closing the game Or powering off. 

He grabed a dark navy blue jacket that was hanging in the door. Couples with his casual black trousers he looked particularly sharp. 

He pocketed his phone in his right pocket as walked towards the front gate of his house. 

 

Tick! Tick! 

The car lights lit up after clicked the open button in his keys.

He opened the car door and got inside without any extra movements. 

The car roared to life as he slowly drove to the main gate. 

A security gas was sitting in a small guard post. 

The security guard noticed the bright lights coming from the car and immediately stood up. 

The guard quickly opened the large steel gate with metalic screech. After opening the gate the guard stepped aside, waiting for the car. 

The car slowly came to the main gate before stopping in front of the old guard. 

the man rolled down the window and looked at the guard. He spoke slowly and softly. 

"" Uncle Sam.  I'm going to the convince store, do you want something? "" 

As he spoke, white smoke came out because of the cold. 

Hearing the man, the guard shook his head. 

"" No no. My boy Adam. I don't need anything "" 

Adam frowned and his eyes narrowed. 

"" Cmon. Say it "" 

The guard shook his again. 

"" I'm serious I don't need anything. "" 

Adam starred at the old guard without moving. 

The guard sighed helplessly. 

"" Fine fine, grab me some cigarettes and a sandwich if you can"" 

Adam smiled. 

"" You should've said so earlier, old man"" 

He turned on his car and drove off in the road. 

Adam was driving in an empty road with the only light source being the cars headlights and the faint milky white glow of the moon. 

The mix of the bright yellow of the car light and moonlight created an ethereal palish yellow that followed the front of the car, wherever the headlights fell. 

As the car drove bit by bit, slowly the moonlight started to dim, and after driving for only 10 minutes the moonlight almost disappeared. 

Now the only light source remaining is the bright yellow headlights. 

As Adam drove, his eyes scanned the surroundings. 

It was pitch dark with the trees and rocks getting an even darker pitch of black. 

One could almost mistake them for dark figures if they didn't have a light. 

"" Maybe I overdid it "" Adam mumbled to himself while driving. 

"" But then again, the keyboard was pretty old and I already got a new one"" 

He grinned a little. 

"" Just an excuse to bring out the new stuff, I guess ""

Suddenly Adam saw smoke coming out of his cars engine. 

At first Adam panicked but quickly shook his head and slowly pulled up in the wide and empty road. 

He got off his car and came in the front to look at what's wrong with his car. 

He opened the cars Hood to find that the engines wires were burned to a crisp. 

The smell of the burned wires wafted into Adams nose before he raised his arm to cover his nose

Adam let out a deep sigh. 

"" I could try to fix it but I'm not sure I'll be successful ""

He looked around the empty road. 

"" No cars at this time either "" 

He closed the hood with a loud thud. 

He slowly walked and got inside his car. 

"" Well, at least the light is still on"" 

Adam took out his phone from his pocket. He opened it to find there's no signal. 

He tried to call the emergency number but still no answer. 

At this moment it seemed like the whole world was trying to isolate Adam. But Adam did not show even a hint of fear in his face. Only annoyence lay written across his face. 

Tap! Tap! Tap! 

He taped on steering wheel Rythematically. 

"" Well..... I guess I'm stranded here until the day comes. "" 

His taping become more rapid as thought. 

' well not like it's the worst situation I've been in. ' 

He suddenly stopped the taping. 

He leaned in the seat and adjusted the elevation to get more comfortable. 

"" Nighty night world"" . After saying that he closed his eyes while half laying, half sitting. 

Hours passed as he slept soundly. Without caring about the world outside. 

On the outside however, the night refused to pass. Still engulfed in the pitch black environment. 

But as time passed, slowly clear white fog started to surround the area of the car. 

However, even in this state Adam had not woken up. 

A few more hours later , Adams eyes started to twitch.

 A while later, he opened his eyes slowly. 

A faint tint of red can be noticed in his eyes, that appears when one is not well rested. 

He elevated his seat back to the original position. 

"" Ouch"" He grumbled while leaning in front to look through the window. 

He rubbed his back with his right hand as he glanced around him. 

"" What the..... "" He said in annoyance and with a faint surprise. 

He opened his car door with a click and got out. The cold wind him square in the face. 

Adam instinctively raised his left arm to cover his face while holding the car gate with the right one. 

Against the howling wind, Adam stood strong and firm. His left hand was clenched into a tight fist and the right hand was gripping the door as hard as it can, resulting in a faint crunch sound of metal. 

After the wind calmed down a bit, Adam peaked at the front. 

There a figure stood, covered in black cloak while holding a lantern with blueish purple flames. 

Adam got startled at first but slowly a thin smile appeared on his face. 

"" Old man sam..... Looks like you're not getting your sandwich anytime soon. ""

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

When i got to his house everything was normal, we were just gossiping about people at gym and watching spongebob, when he randomly asked me an inappropriate question about my sexual life. I felt uncomfortable and I told him that, he then proceeded to tell me verbatim ""you know that if i wanted to i can kiss you"". This unsettled me and i moved further away, he then grabbed my hands and started kissing me and touching my thighs, chest and private area. I kept saying no, but i froze. He kept getting rougher and i eventually pushed him off. He got quite upset and pushed me on the sofa and continued touching me. I then pushed him off myself cussed him out and managed to get out

1qlat3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATiim/comments/1qlat3k/aeon_daily_article_reading/,AEON Daily article reading,"Creative writing used to be a human prerogative: do it well, do it badly, but either way endorse the consensus that to write about human experience was worth the candle and the coffee. Here was an essential human act, so much so that poetry formed a critical part of the computer pioneer Alan Turing’s original test: to determine whether an unseen respondent to a series of questions was human or a mechanical imposter. The Turing Test is often simplified to denote a single crossing point between two territories, human and machine. Pass the test, and artificial intelligence can stroll on over to our side of the line. Take a look around. Decide what to do with us. But, first, it has to pass.

In the paper ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’ (1950), published in the journal *Mind*, Turing set out his objective: ‘to consider the question, “Can machines think?”’ In true human fashion, he immediately re-phrases the question, at some length, and eventually arrives at the ‘imitation game’, modelled on a drawing-room entertainment from before the internet, before television. The original game he has in mind involves a guesser in the hotseat who poses questions to a man (X) and a woman (Y), who are out of sight and hearing in a separate room. The guesser has to determine from their written answers which is the man and which the woman. X tries to mislead, and wins if the guesser is wrong; Y wins if the guesser is right. Try it, it’s fun.

In this context, the first question posed in Turing’s proposed test is less surprising than at first it seems: ‘Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?’ Next, Turing asks, equally politely: ‘Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.’ Two questions in, and the contested boundary between human and machine thinking is already looking for answers in literature, in art. Turing’s 1950s version of X – the participant aiming to mislead – replies: ‘Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.’ To imagine this answer, in the second phase of his game, Turing’s complicated brain is playing the role of a machine playing X, hidden from sight and typing its answers, pretending to be a man (who previously played the game pretending to be a woman). I know, but if the test were easy an air-fryer could pass it.

Turing isn’t suggesting that a machine can’t write poetry. In the convoluted logic of the imitation game, X calculates that in 1950 ordinary people didn’t write poetry, a commonsense assumption that every computer masquerading as human should know. Among other prejudices from the mid-20th century, Turing’s paper makes incautious references to race, religion and the Constitution of the United States. He likens the inability to see computers as sentient as equivalent to the ‘Moslem view that women have no souls’. Turing wades in: he doesn’t compute as we would now.

And neither do the future computers of 2026 that he was trying to envisage. Any of today’s large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT or Claude, can write an instant sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. I typed in Turing’s test question, and Claude 4 threw up 14 lines of poetry including the abbreviated word ‘mathemat’cal’, for the scansion. The poem made sense, and was formally a sonnet, and appeared in seconds.

Whether or not this counts as thinking, Turing intuits that the frontier he’s marking out will be picketed by the arts. In his paper, he picks a fight with an eminent neuroscientist of the time, Sir Geoffrey Jefferson of the Royal Society, who believed that ‘Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain – that is, not only write it but know that it had written it.’ For Jefferson, addressing the Royal College of Surgeons in his 1949 Lister Oration, mechanising the efforts of the infinite monkeys on typewriters didn’t really count.

These days, in the arts, it’s harder to share Jefferson’s confidence. The advances made by AI prick at artistic vanity – the work of a human artist can’t be all that special if a machine can replicate the results almost instantly. That hurts. A great human artist, we’d like to believe, amplifies and defends the exceptionalist spirit of our species but, in an echo of the anxieties that haunted early photography, a demonised version of AI threatens to steal away our souls. Encroaching on the best of what we can do and make and be, machine art intrudes onto sacred territory. Creative artists are supposed to be special, inimitable.",1,1769221980.0,CATiim,0,1.0,False
