1fyh9xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1fyh9xt/enneagram_typing_would_appreciate_some_speculation/,Enneagram typing- would appreciate some speculation.,"Hello there.

I’ve been pretty interested in enneagram for a while now, I find myself stuck between 4/5/6 and 9.

I’ve repeatedly gotten 5 on the tests, but find myself speculating. 
I’ve been at it for a month now just reading, and still find myself relating to these strongly in some aspects.
I’m aware I am under functional right now, Im aware I can sound so negative. I’m just trying to get to the bottom of what I am to know my core needs in order to thrive better. 

Tests I’ve taken and results:

Eclectic energies: Type 5 balanced wing
Tri-Type results: 5w6-1w9-3w4




Writing all of this out took me a while, but I wanted to be as through as possible. Feel free to ask any questions or if I need to elaborate on anything.


Here’s me answering a questionnaire. Afterwards I included a few facts about myself.

* Tell me about your internal experience of yourself. What makes you, you?

I’m not entirely sure. I feel I have great potential but struggle to feel “special”.
I’m not digging my heels, I’m actively welcoming experiences/jobs/opportunities and trying things that pique my interest- but I’m also not forcing anything.
I will say at times I feel like a passenger in my life or a bit disconnected, I do tend to in my head. Time is going by faster and faster and it’s a bit overwhelming, there’s little time to know things and I feel a bit spread thin. So much to learn and so little time.
This doesn’t mean I don’t feel things deeply, I just feel really preoccupied.

* You just had a really good day. Describe it. It can be a real recent example or an aspirational one.

It would work out like this:

I would wake up fairly early and take my time getting ready. I would then take a notebook, planner or recent book of interest to one of our local cafes and sit there for a while planning, reading into something I find interesting and enjoying a small breakfast and coffee.

I would then make my rounds around stores I like around town, looking at the new nicknacks, stocking up on what I need.

I would have ample time to get stuff done but also be able to do what I like without feeling pressured- playing my favorite video games, reading, some self care, learning a new hobby. 

Then I would have time to make myself a nice dinner, watch some media (I like documentaries or some animated films) and settle in for the night.

Just calm, not rushed. I can get done what I need done without obligations, plans, anything.


* If someone is upset with you, what is the typical reason for it? Give a recent example.

I’ve had loved ones get irritated or complain about not seeing me as often. I’ve said I have a few things to take care of at home and they’ve been like “that’s not THAT important”- but to me, if I don’t get it done, I just stress about it the entire time.
As much as I like the idea, I can only handle them in small doses. I love them but they take a lot out of me. I have limited time and energy, I work 6 days a week and rarely have time for myself so I try to be fair.

* What are you like when you’re stressed? What are your coping mechanisms? Give an example of a recent stressful situation and how you handled it.

It happened while I was at work today- I usually just retreat into my head. I’m very good at keeping it under wraps, so I can work on a solution and to minimized how long I feel stressed for. Most people can’t tell what’s going on unless they know me closely and I prefer it that way.

I think about everything, the negatives, and create plans on how to fix them. I’ll often create lists and I start feeling more relaxed having a plan. If it’s terrible stress, I can’t even find the energy or patience to put it on paper.

When I get home after a stressful day, I just don’t feel motivated to do anything. 
As of late I haven’t been healthy, so I notice I usually neglect my physical self (showering, washing face, etc.) and I just zone out on my phone. I jump from interesting video, to music, to researching deeper into whatever I’m currently interested in, Wikipedia articles about random things, etc.
I can feel my head feel hot, I just feel overwhelmed and stressed and not sure what to do about it besides “take it easy”- I don’t know how to fully relax.

I heavily rely on caffeine and sugar as well.

* What pushes your buttons? What makes you angry? How does your anger manifest? Can you be openly angry with others?

A whole list of things. People “commanding” me when it’s unnecessary. People telling me what I “should” be doing. Inconsiderate people without simple manners or considerations, treating me less than human. Being treated as if I don’t know what I’m doing whatsoever.
People unwilling to communicate and come to a solution, or those who complain but won’t accept any advice as to how to fix it. 

If there’s a tense moment, I won’t be the one to bring it up. 

I’m very good at keeping my anger under wraps unless you know me closely. I’ll swallow it and distract myself, convince myself it’s a waste of time. If you’re the person who upset me however and you ask in the moment, I will be very direct. If they don’t ask I might be a little “miffed” but I’ll still be getting stuff done.
I prefer having time to think out a thorough way to express, though by the time that happens it doesn’t feel worth bringing up. I don’t want to seem immature.

I’ll never be outright angry, unless it’s completely blatantly rude and direct.

* what’s your deepest fear? Why is that your fear?

Not knowing what to do in a situation. I like to learn little simple facts or things that could potentially be useful. 
I don’t want to be “useless”, but I also know I’m not meant to know what to do in every situation.
But then, even with little things, I feel a bit overwhelmed, panic and often hesitate. It’s a cycle.

It’s why at work, the things that stress me out most is two superiors having different ways of working, being told two different things and them not having the consistent and shared expectations. 
I need to know exactly what’s expected, what it does, why we do it in order to feel fully comfortable. I don’t like having it left to interpretation or else I’ll overthink it. I’m not intending to “step on anyones toes” when I’m just trying to make a living.

* What types of memories cause you the most shame? What feelings cause you the most shame? What is it about them that causes shame?

The memories of me being negative or careless when I knew better, but was too upset to care. Being rude to people when it was undeserved. Indulging in spending or buying unnecessary things.

Feelings that cause me shame are anger, anxiety and the way I become unempathetic when under a lot of stress. I don’t like anger because it’s become so much more prevalent than my anxiety over the years. My tolerance dwindles, I become more concerned with giving myself space to calm down than I do anything else.

It brings me shame because if I let the emotions get the best of me, I won’t be able to keep levelheaded. I also don’t want to come across as emotional or unstable. 

* What is your relationship with pleasure? What gives you pleasure? Can you have pleasure when you want it, or do you have to earn it?

It’s complicated. I feel better when I earn it, although If it just happens- I won’t fight it. I’ve never been one to think “I don’t/do deserve this!”

I can’t have it when I want it, only because it happens in small doses with experiences. I can’t buy it, but I can create it.
By making myself a special drink I like, going to a shop that makes me feel happy, learning/researching something new, “investing” in myself by doing something “extra” like buying a special coffee or a face mask.

I think there’s a difference between created pleasure and pleasure that happens within just existing.

I feel bad having to “make” or push myself to be spending time with friends because I feel my mind tells me there’s things I need to be doing- but sometimes they quiet and I’m able to be immersed in the moment. It feels like the stars have to align for anything to feel “right”.

* Whats your relationship with authority? Think both abstractly and with specific authorities in your life, possibly your parents, boss, religious leader, doctor or government figures? Are you an authority?

It’s complicated, again.
While I do think there needs to be some regulations and rules about certain things, but it need to be thoroughly explained as to WHY, the risks and reasoning. It seems people are more likely do rebel when they’re told to do something and not given any reason and I’m one of them. It’s exercising autonomy.

I also have a voice in my head that says “you can’t tell me what to do!”- despite knowing certain things are in place for reasons.

I don’t listen to the authorities in my life, I may speak to my mom to hear her opinion or experiences about certain things to get a better perspective but it doesn’t mess with my final decision.

I don’t like being bossed, or being told to do little obvious things. I have a hard time not taking it to heart because it’s undermining how capable I am. It’s a fast way to anger me, but I remind myself they’re just doing their jobs. I hate commands or a lack of basic respect for no reason, or things being worded “you need” or commands. Just ask me to do it, I’ll do it because it’s what I’m here for.

I don’t follow any religious teachings as I’ve never felt drawn to be devoted to anything- I appreciate the community aspect and how it can bring people together but I’m also aware of the possible manipulation of fear can be used. I’m not generalizing, I just prefer not to get involved. I just don’t feel 100% about anything, it’s hard for me to have a faith.

I respect medical professionals, but I’m also one to research further into a medication they may have given me out of knowing possible side effects, what to expect, what’s typical, etc.

I don’t have strong political opinions, as I see a few arguments from both sides being agreeable. I’m not politically knowledgeable enough to claim myself as anything outright, I moreso just share my ideals without a label. 
I’m skeptical about any leader, though. The debates were an absolute joke and I dislike how casual it was and how it felt more like a roasting session than anything. It’s embarrassing.

* When your mind wanders what are you thinking about?

A variety of things. Depends on the day. 
I usually have a to do list in my head, or things I need more information about etc.
If I have a shopping list I’m comparing products and seeing which one is best, cheapest, where to get it, etc. and I end up wasting time.
I’m usually planning things out, then feeling too overwhelmed to execute them when I have time.
I also think about neat things I’d potentially like to do.
If I’m going through something, I’m usually thinking about how to deal with it.

* You have a decision to make, describe how you decide what to do.

Depends, I don’t like spur of the moment decisions unless I have time to think about it. Unless I’m the one making a decision I usually don’t feel safe enough to go along with whatever. I get anxious and uneasy.

I’m complicating this in my head but it comes down to having the time to look up and learn more about something, assess and come to a decision. I hate being pushed.

* What’s your biggest flaw?

I can’t really just come to one.
I think I can be sensitive to criticism, I take too long to make decisions no matter how simple and I don’t put my time to good use.

I don’t think I have a “biggest flaw” but rather a lot of little ones that build up into me working against myself even if I’m not aware of it.

* What makes you special?

I don’t feel special, when I put into perspective just how big universe is and how small I am I usually feel quite significant. 
It can be both inspiring, pushing me to whatever I want to be because I’m the grand scheme it doesn’t really affect anything.. but also empty feeling that whatever I do will be comparatively insignificant.

I can’t say I’ve had anything special, unique or particularly extreme happen in my life as much as my head can make it out to be bigger than it is.

All I can say is that I’m the only person with my exact personality, shape, size, smell, biological makeup, way of thinking, etc. and that I’m a sense does make me special- I can’t be copied to the exact.

* How much mental energy is spent on focusing about each of the past, the present and the future?

Future definitely receives the most. I’m always planning, creating lists, anticipating and preparing. I have ideals and I actively look into what needs to be done in order to achieve them. It frustrates me how many obstacles and my own physical weaknesses can get in the way of it, though.

I would say past next, surprisingly. I do draw from some past experiences to avoid doing things the same and apply it to the future. I do have some hang ups that subconsciously effect how I react to things and I’m aware of them- so I do take that into consideration.

Present last. I’m very much in my head and have a hard time being in the moment. I find it hard to relax and be “in the moment” without a mental checklist or all my interests popping up. People can get frustrated with me seeming uninterested when I’m not.

* You unexpectedly find yourself with a whole weekend with no obligations, and everyone else is busy. How do you feel about it? What do you do?

I’ve had something like this where my weekly hangout with friends was cancelled and I felt terrible for feeling excited about it. 

I tend to compartmentalize my time, I would have one day working on groceries, deep cleaning chores, obligations, etc. and the other day to just be myself and do whatever on a whim. 

I’d probably revisit and zone out on video games I’m interested in or love already. Maybe try a new recipe I saw, or zoning out on a good book (I collect a lot and don’t usually have time to read them)
I might delve into doing something unnecessary and extra (my nails, face masks, etc.) but I usually can’t be bothered.

All in all, if I had time to do whatever I wanted to without time constraints I would be so happy. I wouldn’t feel guilt for not spending time with loved ones since they’re busy living their lives as well. It’s great.

* What’s your personal vibe/style/aesthetic? How cultivated vs natural is it, and how much time do you spend on it? Do you turn it on and off?

I have personal blindness. I feel like a conglomeration of different little things and don’t feel I have a specific “aesthetic”. I like many things.
I’ve asked others about what I remind them of and I’ve been told various things- it’s not my top priority except for when I find myself down fashion rabbit holes.
 I try to find the EXACT thing I am, and if I don’t fit the box I can get frustrated. Like kibbe body types, aesthetics, etc.
I know it’s limited thinking but I can’t help it.

I get frustrated not being anything specific and tend to obsess for a while, find different systems, wring people close to me into it and explain it to them until it just kinda tapers off.

I find the less I try with someone like fashion the better things tend to go- it’s not my main interest. I have issues with just “being” but this isn’t a priority to me. 
I admit I have my own personal traumas of having image pushed on me for years as a child- I just want to seem clean and capable.

* Which of the following is more like you? Explain.
A) I know what I want, I go out and make it happen
B) I am content to be on my own and not draw attention to myself
C) I have to be responsible and dedicated, and I put others’ needs first.

I would say B. I dream of having my own apartment and personal space and living by my own schedule without obligations- and when there are ones, they’re planned ahead of time. 
Though I do feel a bit drawn to everything, even if just a little. I do place importance in being responsible and dedicated. If it’s close loved ones, I’ll offer help but probably won’t be all that enthusiastic about it.
I would say A) is hardest. I makes nice lists with set steps to make it easy for myself to follow them and yet I never do them. Frustrating. 

* Which of the following is most like you?
A) I dislike stress and negative vibes, and I may try to distract myself from problems.
B) I have strong feelings, get worked up easily and I’m not afraid to show it.
C) I don’t like to let my feelings show; they get in the way of being efficient and logical.

The most, I relate to C. When I’m feeling stressed I really repress them and focus on the task at hand- then worry that I seemed overwhelmed, angry or anxious to people afterwords. I would hate to seem obvious.
I would definitely feel more drawn towards getting work done, getting it done efficiently and getting another stressor out of the way. Anything extra feels unnecessary.
People won’t know what I’m feeling and I want to keep it that way until I can decide and work through it.

A I relate too as well, mostly for wanting to distract myself from some issues at hand and focusing on other things I’m more interested in.

* Which of the following is more like you? Explain.
A) I look to others for feedback and guidance and am willing to be flexible when needed.
B) I am always aware of how things could be better and I’m disappointed that they are not.
C) deep down, I am afraid people won’t give me what I need unless I make it worth their while.

I would say A but with some limits.
A more-so when it applies to work. I want to be efficient, I like to know what their clear expectations are and I want to do it well. 

B is more just in general. I notice little things, details and what needs to be corrected but get frustrated that there isn’t much time to get them done- or that I lack the energy to bother with them at times.


Extra facts, details, mannerisms, mindsets;

* My inward perspective vs what people actually see are very different. I’ve been told I seem quiet, professional, observant and analytical but also kind, sentimental and grounded. On the inside I have a lot going on, I feel as though I always have something on my mind.

* I want to work alone. I have been having to work retail/food service for a few years and it’s the most soul-sucking thing. I feel like I could be applying myself better elsewhere.

* I feel ironic in that I notice small details and things that could be taken care of at work and want to do them- but frustrated that there isn’t time to do them or that they’re not really taken care of.

* I don’t like disappointing people, but I will if I have to. I’m not easily swayed into doing something I don’t want too. I feel as though with first meetings I give off “impressive” and then I hate having expectations put on me and not meeting them. I don’t usually take responsibility for them- it’s just frustrating.

* I get irritated seeing people do a slack job at work, but I also understand not being paid enough to care. It’s very much a “if you leave me to do my job, I’ll leave you to yours” unless they look like they’re struggling or ask for help- then I’m happy too. When I’ve had coworkers the same position as me try to boss me- I don’t allow it. If it’s subtle bossing I return the favor.

* I can put on a social mask and be pretty charismatic- when my livelihood depends on it. In my past jobs I had to sell and push credit cards and memberships, I did very well and got a mug from it. Felt easy but also “greasy” to be doing so and didn’t work there long.

* I’m kind of a jerk and get excited in conversations and finish the ends of sentences for people- I’ve reeled it back but I still get the compulsion.

* I feel like people don’t know the real me. Even with my lover, I don’t share ALL of the music I like, interests, comics I enjoy, etc. because I don’t feel like explaining why I do. I feel like I have to explain my interest.

* I get caught up on details and as a result, give up explaining because it feels to overwhelming to put into words or to type. I like world building, but my mind works like “Harbor town is base setting>what is the bestselling fish there?>Whats the trade routes lead too?>what’s the history behind this place?>” and I have to take the time to make things bite sized, otherwise I just go on and on.

* I have an interest in research. When I was younger I was interested in biology. I’ve written papers on the shark finning epidemic and seal anatomy as they’ve evolved. Then in later High school my focus shifted to aerospace manufacturing- I thought it was my calling for a while and became the host of the after school club, but wasn’t the best at it. I kinda just wanted to do my own thing. I was turned off by the loud, dangerous and competitive atmosphere. In college, I was enrolled for environmental science but my studies were interrupted with Covid- I’ve been working to survive since.

* I worked as a veterinary assistant for a year- loved the learning aspect, not so much the applied practice. Doctors are very, very busy and have little time to explain why they do certain things- so I was super frustrated being told to do things and being aware of all the risks of understanding them thoroughly. It wasn’t their fault, but it was increasingly frustrating. After a while the stress was too much and I left. It was a very secure job, promised an education in the veterinary field after a while of service but it just didn’t seem like what I was really looking for.

* I have a good sense of direction, even in places I’ve been to only once before.

* I’ve had a bad habit of posting somewhere to hear opinions/facts/information, then not responding to the comments that reply. I kinda take my info and leave, it can be overwhelming to respond to everyone.

* I feel empty without school, or having things or tasks to study. I have many vague interests and tend to learn a base level of information, but then something else catches my interest. 

* I can be stubborn and do things the hard way at times if I feel like people are undermining me. I will rebel or shut down when people don’t give me a chance to look things over myself.

* Im drawn to an addiction to sugar and caffeine, although I’m sensitive to it. I don’t like drugs that alter how my body feels, or seeing what’s not there. I like having control of myself. I can tolerate alcohol but I don’t feel drawn to it like sugar or caffeine. I’ll smoke or drink to unwind in social situations.

* I’m terrible at keeping contact with people, even loved ones. It’s nothing personal, but I’m just busy with life and feel I have limited energy for myself and my own interests. My parents and grandparents live minutes away, and yet I have to set a date and time to see them. When they show up unexpectedly it stresses me out and I don’t like knowing how long they’ll be around. My dad used to rope me into things without checking if I wanted to do them, sometimes they’d take hours. Now I don’t tolerate it.

* I feel I have a specific brand of humor that few enjoy or understand except my closest circles. I can come across as weird or dry, I’ve had my sarcasm come across as truth. 

* I often get tempted to spend more money because I work SO much, I feel I owe it to myself to have a  little “treat”. It ends up making me feel worse so I’ve stopped, but I still get the urge when I’m a little stressed to get myself something nice.

* I never ask for help. Ever. When I was younger I would rather suffer and try to figure it out myself rather than ask- that lead to my parents making me post “ask for help” stickers around the house to remind myself to do so when I was in my young teens. It never stuck.

* I have issues with feeling disconnected from my body, like I’m watching myself in third person. I very much live in my head and feel like a separate entity from myself at times which can be really confusing. 

* I don’t feel like I have a strong sense of self, I’ve asked people about their impressions of me from the outside. Just out of curiosity.

* When I get obsessed with things, I might share with people to gauge their reactions. Like now, it’s the enneagram, so I’ve sent it to a few people who might be interested because I wanted to see what they got and their opinions.

* My emotions hit me like a truck sometimes. Sometimes I cry out of nowhere because I’ve had things on the back burner for so long.

* When my body feels off my mind races with various issues that could be wrong, I research into the causes, symptoms, etc. I am a hypochondriac.

* I thrift a lot, I never buy anything new if I can help it and it’s actually led to me lose some time to do anything important. I never buy anything new unless absolutely necessary.

* I will hold onto little things I don’t need at times, not necessarily hoarding. Just in case I’ll need them.

* I will drive to multiple stores just to pick up one thing at a lower price.

* I am creative and artistic, but I’ve been so burnt out I have zero drive.

* I feel very modest, my boyfriend (a 3) often brings up whatever impressive thing I’m doing at the time- it bothers me he volunteers the information but I know he means well.

* I don’t beat around the bush with issues and I’m direct- we need to talk about this and find out how to solve it. Yes or no. What do you need. I think it’s a waste of time.

* I’m bad about just buying things, I’ll be at the grocery store for hours researching different hemp milk brands, comparing nutrition, etc. 

* I’ll prepare for things in trips, very well. Snacks, comforts, music playlists, anything really.

* In indecisive and see lots of perspectives, but once I’m able to find what I think is best I don’t hesitate to share it.

* I hate sudden plans or “go with the flow”, I need to have time to prepare myself.

* I think I’ve lost the art of “relaxing”, I always feel there’s something to clean, do, learn about, etc.

* I create various lists, ideas, plans, “vision boards” but never put them into action- to be fair, I’ve been very busy as of late.

* I can be perfectionistic- to the point where even a simple list has to be in order. Grocery shopping? If the milk isn’t under the fridge section I will scrap the entire page. Example, I organize it by order in the store and make sure to do frozen stuff last.

* I feel I have a lot of untapped potential and that I get in my own way.

* When I’m at my worst I shut the world out, lazy, call out of work, neglect my physical self and surroundings and do nothing.

* I apologize frequently when unaligned.

* I get angry at myself for not knowing things off the bat when they seem so obvious.

* I feel uneasy being taken care of or pampered but deep down I appreciate it.

* When I like a game, I learn a lot about the lore. I love the elder scrolls series, LOTR, etc. and the world and history.

* I take tests (enneagram, MBTI, IQ tests) with a grain of salt, I feel anyone would.

* I can be a little too polite, but not afraid to put boundaries when it’s too much (think Bilbo baggins) 

* I start many projects (I’ve made fire cider, dried orange peels to make ornaments, I’m working on painting a mural) and like doing many small neat things.

* I have fun with considering the possibility of astrology/spirituality/religion, though feel a deep innate doubt. 

* I would consider myself practical.

* I have many interests but delving into all of them overwhelms me.

* I can be a little close minded and feel as if I have to make my thoughts make sense, I’m aware of this and know it can limit things.

* I’m sentimental.

* I can talk with people about their emotions, but I’m not good at just listening. I immediately try to come up solutions and feel off wallowing in what is.

* At my worst I don’t feel much hope or belief in anything. Things can feel dark, pointless and empty, like there isn’t much to anything.

* I don’t see things in black and white except for a few obvious things. I can still choose a “side”, while also not fully agreeing with everything.

* If I have a purpose, I’m not sure what it is. I’m not obsessed with finding out, but I am trying many things to see what clicks. I had hoped by now something would’ve clicked.",1,1728331780.0,EnneagramTypeMe,0,1.0,False

1fyh69e,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1fyh69e/so_glad_stars_hollow_does_not_have_a_bar/,so glad stars hollow does not have a bar!!,"

I was listening to Scott Patterson podcast and they were discussing the absence of a bar in the original series, and how the secret bar was a great thing in the AYITL because they always missed a bar in the original serie. I loved the secret bar in ayitl but in the original series I didn't miss a bar at all!  Seriously, being bar-free, it’s one of the best aspects of stars hollow.

First off, the **community vibe** is off the charts! Without a bar, everyone gathers at places like Luke's Diner and Weston's. We’re talking about genuine connections over coffee and pancakes instead of trying to shout over loud music and awkward small talk. You want to bond with your neighbors? Grab a slice of pie and chat about life! Evenings are outside in the towns square or cozy at each others homes!

And let’s be real, the **safe environment** is a huge plus! Families can come in with their kids without worrying about a rowdy crowd. Like the little kids climbing on the sort of big anvill (?) that Emily had deliver at Luke's because she was angry at Lorelai, while the kids' parents sip on coffee—it's wholesome, and it feels like a community that genuinely cares for everyone.

Then there’s the whole **caffeine culture**. Coffee and tea spark conversation and creativity. I mean, how many life-changing discussions have happened over a cup of joe? It’s the perfect setting for brainstorming, heart-to-hearts, or just chilling.

And don’t even get me started on the **quaint atmosphere**! That diner charm is unmatched. The cozy booths, the smell of fresh coffee, and the laughter of locals create an ambiance that a loud bar could never provide. It’s the kind of place where everyone knows your name, and you actually want to hang out!

Let’s be honest: without a bar, the town is way less dramatic. Bars come with all sorts of nightlife chaos. Who needs that? Stars Hollow is peaceful, allowing for genuine growth and relationships. We get enough drama from the town gossip without adding late-night drunk antics to the mix!

Plus, those **frequent hangouts**? Luke’s and Weston's become community staples! You walk in, and it’s like family. Everyone knows each other, and that sense of belonging is priceless. It creates bonds that go beyond surface-level interactions.

And can we say **healthier choices**? With coffee and tea on the menu, residents are more likely to make better lifestyle decisions. Sure, we indulge in comfort food, but the focus on non-alcoholic drinks makes for a more vibrant, healthy community. Although yeah the gilmore girls arent necesarilly known for the healthy food choices lol. But what I love is that the options are there and constantly presented. Specifically Luke's at season 1 where he presented more of his healthy foods like peppermint tea and vegetables.

In conclusion, the absence of a bar in Stars Hollow isn’t just a quirk; it’s what makes the town so special! So here’s to the diners, the coffee, and the beautiful, drama-free connections that keep this place thriving!",2,1728331523.0,GilmoreGirls,0,1.0,False
1fyh63i,https://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1fyh63i/toxic_relationship_with_my_bike_flat_after_flat/,Toxic relationship with my bike - Flat after flat,"Been cycling for over 6 months now and over the past month I've gotten 4 flats, all on my rear wheel. Riding 10 miles a day + grocery runs, about 3 times a week.

Got [my bike](https://olivercycling.com/collections/frontpage/products/urban-city-ocf-006b) (single speed, small frame) second hand for less than half price and it was practically new. Looked at it with love every morning while waiting for my coffee to brew. She's not perfect, but she's mine.

But the honey moon stage is over, I guess...

  
I've been getting flats, always on my rear wheel. I've gone through 3 inner tubes in less than a month, and now today a slashed tyre (which was new).

The flats started about a month into riding with Panaracer Pasela tyres (size 23). So last week I swapped to Michelin Dynamic classics, this time size 25 for both wheels. Cleaned the rims. Oiled my chain. Inflated to recommended pressure & checked every day before leaving. 

And yet, here I am back again walking home with my bike, defeated, sweaty, and dreaming of a £500 bike I saw online last night at 2 am. It's like my bike knows when I've been eyeing up other bikes.

1fyh5up,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fyh5up/navigating_bisexuality_misunderstanding_emotions/,"Navigating bisexuality, misunderstanding emotions, past connections (27F) and moving forward (27F)?","TLDR: Navigating a past relationship and moving forward.

I have been searching reddit for months hoping to find something similar to a situation I have been apart of. Looking for advise or insight from people who may have experienced something similar. 

I 27F, now know that I am attracted to women, but also currently dating men and have only ever dated men. I have had experiences with women. At the time, I didn't believe I was bi/lesbian. I thought that I was drunk, having fun, whatever. I was stupid and likely inconsiderate of my own and obviously other people's feelings.

Anyways, I am writing this because I feel haunted by a relationship I had with a specific woman, now 2 years ago. Not an actually defined relationship, more so on and off hooking up for 3 years. Close friendship. An insane connection where I felt seen, heard, and appreciated. She's out as a lesbian.

I have had an entire self realization journey since that friendship has dissipated. While the friendship was occurring, I would never have admitted that I was bi/lesbian despite actively hooking up with her and openly expressing feelings towards the end. I will add a horrible, forever-regretful piece of context to this as well. At the time, I had a long term boyfriend of multiple years throughout the entire thing with her. I already live with the extreme guilt from this situation, I don't need people to tell me how horrible I was for that. I already know. I also was so oblivious to her having feelings for me. I thought she also only wanted to hook up. There was obviously more to this than just hooking up, and I felt that at the time, but I was oblivious to my own feelings, let alone hers.

We would spend nights having the most intimate feeling interactions. I don't know if it felt so intimate to me because it was my first true experience with a woman outside or drunkenly making out with friends in high school and college. Or being hyper-sexualized by men and encouraging sexual interactions with other women. We would spend the entire night talking about everything from somewhat trivial things to the deepest parts of our life experiences, mixed in with being intimate. I knew that she cared about me, but at the time, I had a hard time seeing it as anything else but in a friendship kind of way. I also struggled with this situation, because most if not all of the interactions, we were both drunk. I thought it was something she liked to do when she was drunk. I thought she liked my attention when she was drunk, but didn't want that at any other time. Outside of this, we would hang out as friends. Trips with other friends. Nights out drinking (usually ended in us together). Dinner. Bring me breakfast and coffee. Lunches. Hiking. You get the picture.

I knew she was upset or uncomfortable that I had a boyfriend. She would make small comments here and there about it. ""Oh, you're still with him,"" etc. We had even hung out all together. I told him what I had done on several occasions. That's an entirely different situation. At one point, he saw us making out in the middle of a bar. Obviously he was upset. The last time we saw each other, she asked about him and I lied. When we were drunk, hooking up, and talking, she acknowledge that she knew I was lying about not being with him.

I'm being so honest when I say even when I remember things now that she would say, that I did not take them for face value. She told me various times that she liked me, sober, but would say something like so minor like ""I like you"". I would just laugh or shrug it off because I thought she was joking or trying to make me laugh or saying it in a friendship kind of way. I'm not going to lie, it did make me slightly uncomfortable at the time, not because of what she was saying, but because of the deep rooted issues I had within myself with my confusion about my sexuality and having a boyfriend. I also wasn't sure the way she meant it.

Now that I reflect on the situation, there were some not obvious moments of her letting onto her feelings. Again, I was so oblivious. I didn't think she ACTUALLY liked me. I thought she was just saying those things in a heightened emotional state. And honestly she might have been.

This went on for 2 ish years while we lived in the same town.

I moved away. I went to visit her a few times. Every time, we fell back into the same pattern. Hooking up. Expressing feelings. But when we woke up the next day, nothing. It started to take more of a toll on me in the last year. I started to acknowledge my feelings, but was still entirely confused. In the last year, she told me she loved me multiple times, but only when she was drunk. At this point, I knew it wasn't in a light hearted way, but I also was so confused because it was only ever when she was drunk. I said it back every time. I would wake up and feel so much shame, but not because of her, because of the situation I was putting people through.

The last time, we had probably went a year from the previous time of seeing each other. I was in town for another reason, but reached out to see if she wanted to hangout. We did with some other friends. I stayed with her. Same thing as always. Same routine. This time felt so different to me. I don't know if it was because of the time between our last interaction, or because it actually was different. She kept telling me she loved me while we were hooking up and talking multiple times throughout the night. She begged me to admit that I loved her. I did admit it. I told her I have for years. So much reciprocated words of love were shared between us that night. We woke up in the morning and hooked up again, for the first time sober. We had made out or things sober, but never the intimate and emotional conversations. Hung out like normal the next day. I felt like something was off. I stayed one more night and left the following day.

I felt an enormous rush of guilt, sadness, emotion, I don't know as I was driving home. I loved her. I decided I was going to try to talk about the things we talk about in our drunken nights, while on my way home. I sent her a text explaining that it was eating at me to continue doing this and I wanted her in my life in a more significant way. I was ready to leave my boyfriend. She responded and basically said that there had been various times in our friendship that she wishes I would've admitted this, etc. but that it was too late and it wasn't the right time. I was crushed. This was the start of my emotional fall, breaking up with my boyfriend, moving out. 

What eats at me the most is trying to understand why she would beg me to admit that I loved her, then completely cutting the entire situation off the following day, forever. I feel like I lack closure from the situation, but I also know I am not owed that here, although it still hurts. After those last texts, I sent her a few random light hearted things a few months apart with no response. Her friends told me she seemed sad for a while after I left/texted her.

Maybe she was done being hurt by me, or maybe it wasn't as serious as I had perceived it as. Maybe she thought I was never going to leave and respected herself enough to set that boundary. I just can't grasp expressing so much mutual love for each other to then ending it.

Now that it is over, I haven't talked to her for 2 years. I have a new boyfriend who I adore so much, love dating, and see a life with, but I think about her every single day. So many things remind me of her. I really miss her. Even just our friendship. I think about a life involving her more than I'd like to admit. It's almost as if I have 2 scenarios in my brain of how my life could go. I sometimes wonder if I would've fully explored that situation if I would feel this way years later. I grovel with regret from not being true to myself in the moment, but I also just can't stop thinking about her. I wish I had the nerve to speak up sooner. I wish I would've asked more questions. So many regrets.

I know this whole post is probably absurd and I don't even know what I am hoping to get from it. Probably advise, people having similar stories, community. Who knows. It felt nice to type this out, but I'm still extremely scared of pressing the post button. I was hoping time would dissipate some of these feelings, but it really hasn't. I'm afraid I will live the rest of my life with this hole of regret.",0,1728331496.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

You can't simply be considering this fool’s wishes!” He couldn't help but shout. The countess was not having it. Her eyes were piercing him. 

*Knock*

It was hard to discern who was more furious. The room was very unsettling. Her words were only of hate and malice.

*Knock*

It wasn’t easy to take the current situation at face value.

*Knock* 

The sound pulled Brian from the pages. The room filled with the sound of a thump that is more easily described as a knock. 

“Could you stop? Please.” Brian leaned back in his chair asking politely. The clutter of Brian’s desk showed the habbit’s of a messy person who also had a bit of OCD. His noodle cups were a clean stack next to an open bag of hot chips. A small stack of comics rested on the edge of the desk next to his keyboard. 

“Well since you asked so nicely.” Sofia’s voice whispered in his ear as his feet lifted into the air. Brian’s chair was  tilted like the axes of the earth. Brian grabbed his arm rests clinging to life. “All you do is read,” she said resting her chin on his shoulder. Brian couldn’t speak until he was planted back onto the ground. 

“The countess just figured out who the rat was.” Brian let his words flow out quietly as he bookmarked his place. 

“Interesting, interesting, but there are things happening in real life,” Sofia said, pulling his head back. Their eyes locked. 

“You're not gonna kiss me again are you?” Sofia ignored his question for all of two seconds as she went back to her bed.

“No, like I said when I was drunk, you are the only kiss with a guy I will ever have.” The knocks returned as Sofia leaded back in bed. 

“If you promise to stop throwing that ball I will go out with you.” The knocking subsided with excitement as Sofia jumped to her feet. Brian tossed his book onto his desk as Sofia wrapped around him. Sofia’s hug became tighter as he spoke. “Am I a good kisser?”.                                                                                

“I don’t know I’m the wrong demographic for this question.” Brian pulled his feet up into his chair as he hugged them. He turned his gaze to Sofia who was checking herself out in the mirror. Her long orange hair came down the sides of her tight tank top and black leggings. Her hair was shaved in the back and her bangs were as short as they could be. “Come on get dressed, I heard there's some new band playing at Laten’s.” 

“I don't know why you like that place, it smells of burnt crust,” Brian said, standing up as his chair slid back on its wheels. 

“You're just a sour puss.” Sofia’s words came with a hoodie that she flung over Brian. 

They left locking their door. Sofia pulled Brian close as they walked. Sofia was zipping up her coat as a rice bar hung from her mouth. 

“Wh the seden question.” Sofia’s words came out jumbled as she talked through a rice bar.

“Uhh don't talk with your mouth full I can't understand you,” Brian said holding the door open for Sofia.

“I said, why the sudden question about kissing?” Brian locked eyes with the street light above the stairs as he thought about what to say. 

“I don't know, maybe I'm just feeling alone.” Sofia adjusted her outfit as they started walking again. There was a silence that started to permeate. The sound of the crossing walk filled said silence. 

“Well we are going to a place with people, and I would imagine females will be there, so let me be your wings and guide you to victory.” Sofia’s words boomed as she swung around the stop sign. The light changed as they walked. 

“What about you?* Brian asked, walking backwards watching her strut behind him.

“Who me? I'll just have to leave dry tonight, I mean I'll be happy as long as you are,” Sofia said, gripping her heart in her chest. 

“What would I do without you?” Brian asked himself as he held open the door to Laten’s.

“Let's hope we never find out.” 

The place was dark. Sofia grabbed a table, a waiter, and the attention of everyone inside with her loud voice. The opening band seemed to be wrapping up.

“We're Stuck At Six and this is our song  Grunge War.” The lead singer’s voice boomed over the small crowd as they played fast and loud. Brian was a little unimpressed as he sat there twiddling his thumbs waiting on their drinks. Sofia seemed to be enjoying herself as she rocked back and forth in her chair and as the band slowed to a stop she was the only one cheering. Brian couldn't help but admire her boisterous personality like he always did. As the drinks hit the table the next band took center stage. Brian’s eyes couldn't help but examine the performers. 

The same instruments as last time filled the space but this time a keyboard was set up. Seemed to be a simple four piece band, guitar, drums, bass, and keyboard. Brian just sipped his beer and waited for them to play. There was a faint whisper coming from the stage. It was a bit too dark until lights above the stage flashed on. dyed pink hair stood center stage with a colorful keyboardist to her right. On drums was a very energetic woman with hair down to her feet. And finally on the left was a girl bunched up on her guitar.

“We are The Ambers!” Everyone became quiet as the lead singer grabbed the mic. Brian watched as she slid to her left holding the mic out to the guitarist.

“This song has a name that we haven't thought of yet.” Brian sat up more as the voice of the guitarist gently filled the room. It was quiet and sweet. She was hiding behind her black glasses that bounced the stage light back at the audience. Her fingers barely gripped the neck of the guitar as the sleeves of her raincoat engulfed them. Her bangs fell over her glasses as the rest of her black hair hit her shoulders. You almost couldn't see her sneakers because her black skirt almost hit the floor. 

Every detail poured into Brian's mind as he felt entangled with her beauty. Everything about her drew his eyes. Brian leaned forward in his chair watching and waiting. That's when the music began. It was fast and funky with a punk/disco beat with lyrics of detest for the government and the betrayal of lovers. There was a bit of darkness to it all. Brian couldn't help but applaud when they had finished their set of just three songs. 

“See are you not glad we came?” Sofia asked, trying to obscure Brian’s view with her face. Brian was silent. He couldn't help but feel a bit embarrassed. “What's wrong with you?” Sofia asked, shaking him. Brian wanted to put his head in his lap and scream. This was an existential crisis for Brian. He couldn't work up any amount of courage to do any amount of anything. 

“Sofi, I'm scared.” Brian’s words came with a worried look. Sofia analyzed his expression. 

“We use big boy words here,” she said, getting Brian into a headlock. 

“It's the guitarist,” Brian whispered through his fear. Sofia rubbed his back consoling him.  Sofia pulled herself up dragging Brian as he downed his drink. Brian stumbled to his feet as people were leaving their tables. They drifted through the people with intent. Sofia was on a mission and Brian was on beer, but it wasn't enough to quell his emotions. The band was making their way off stage and out the back. Sofia was determined. 

“You liked our set?” The keyboardist asked, pulling in front of them. She was like an eighties rockstar in a man's body. 

“Wicked cool, we want nothing more than to party with you guys.” Sofia’s words pulled through the loud bar. She smiled, pulling out her phone.

“I'll text you the address for where we are turning up next.” Sofia gladly got her details down. Brian couldn't help but hide behind his savior. Sofia pushed them back to their table. 

“Ok party we're there,” Sofia said, flashing Brian her phone. Brian put his head down on the table. 

“Is it too late to back out?” Brian asked Sofia but he was really asking himself. Sofia wouldn't give him the option to back out. After another drink they waited for their rideshare. Brian’s stomach felt like it wanted to implode. He just sat quietly in the car as Sofia chatted up the driver about different music. Sofia pushed Brian out of the car as they stopped. Brian doubled over like he was about to paint the sidewalk with his insides. 

Sofia dragged Brian out of the street. She pulled him close as they walked down the block. A couple houses down the road the band was pulling up amongst others who were entering the house. Brian smooshed himself into Sofia as he saw the girl that stunned him. 

“How far are we from the dorms?” Brian asked, looking around. Sofia ignored him as she waved to the flamboyant keyboardist who was heading inside. Brian clanged to his friend as they pierced the doorway. Random strangers stood taking up space in this living room. Brian didn’t want to look up but when he did his eyes scanned. He noticed her. She was sitting awkwardly by the lead singer as she nervously strung her guitar that was standing next to her. Sofia pulled her arm around Brian’s neck as they planted onto a musty couch. 

Brian couldn’t help but glance at her. Obviously he felt wrong objectifying her, but she was a visual stimulus that sent his body into an emotional shock. Out of the corner of her eye she glanced at him. Brian was shooked. She sent shivers through his body. Brian quickly pushed Sofia off of him. Brian just put his hands on his lap as the owner of the house was greeting people she had not met before. Soda and snacks started littering the coffee table. Brian felt too nervous to eat or drink. He was already uncomfortable around strangers let alone this girl that he wanted badly to get to know. Sofia began feeding Brian chips and giving him sips off her soda. He became mindless only to snap out of it as smiles erupted watching them. Brian made eye contact with the girl across from him that he was admiring. He almost melted at her smile. Brian sprung up pushing Sofia away from him. Sofia did not get mad at him however she just smiled at him as did everyone else. 

“Uhh bathroom?” Brian fumbled his words as the host directed him down the hall. Brian splashed water on his face after a quick relief. When he stumbled out of the bathroom he noticed people cluttered around the coffee table as tarot cards cleared the way. Brian scanned the small crowd as he noticed his dream girl heading for the front door. Brian quickly bumped Sofia, interrupting conversation. “Let me get a cig,” he said, pulling on her shirt. Sofia rolled her eyes pulling out a pack labeled American Spirits. Brian swiped the whole pack from her as he made his way outside. 

The wind caught him off guard. His eyes followed the wooden railing circling the porch until they landed on the girl leaning on the wall. She pulled herself up as he closed the door behind him. 

“Sorry to bother you,” Brian said as he lit up a smoke. The taste relaxed him and sensation leveled him out. Brian held out his pack. 

“Oh I uhh don’t smoke.” Her voice was quiet and soft. Brian felt his body lean more towards her. 

“Well I only smoke when I need some air,” Brian said, trying to finish his smoke fast. 

“You must not get out a lot then,” she said, raising her brows. Brian just looked at her confused. “That was a joke, sorry I’m not the best at small talk.” Her hands grabbed each other as her body looked like it wanted to implode. 

“That’s ok, I mean not everyone needs to be good at everything, I mean you're great at talking because I’m just bad at being talked at.” Brian’s words slowed with each syllable until he was frustrated with himself. Brian grabbed the door.

“I’m Amber by the way,” she said blurting out her words. 

“Brian.” He let go of the door as his name softly left his mouth.

“You know you guys are really cute,” Amber said, pushing off the wall. Brian’s mind went foggy until he realized what she said. 

“I..but..no she’s gay…we are just best friends.” His words dribbled out of his mouth as Amber laughed. “Wow you have an adorable laugh.” Brian’s heart was almost beating out of his chest. Amber became silent as she looked at him. “I’m sorry that was weird…I…I.” Before Brian could think of what to say the door opened behind him. Sofia wrapped her arm around him as her hand fell on his chest feeling how intense his body was. 

“Hi I’m Sofi.” Sofia’s words were loud until they weren’t. “Just relax,” she whispered into Brian’s ear. 

“Oh I’m Amber,” Amber said, perking up a bit. The sound of the bug zapper on the porch filled brain’s head as he felt like exploding. 

“Like the band,” Sofia said excitedly remembering the name. Amber just nodded as she looked for an opening past them to the door. Sofia turned to the side holding Brian as Amber walked through. Brian was breathing heavily. “Do you want to go back inside?” Brian simply nodded letting Sofia drag him back inside. The cards on the table had switched to playing cards as they plopped back onto the couch. Amber seemed to be gathering her things with the other bandmates. Brian wanted to die. He felt sick to his stomach. “Maybe we should just leave.” Brian again nodded to her words and in a moment they were gone.

Another quiet rideshare later and they were back at the dorms. Brian just stayed quiet until their door closed behind them. He collapsed onto his bed as Sofia collapsed on top of him. 

“What is wrong with me?” Sofia started petting his hair. 

“Nothing is wrong with you, you just aren't used to talking to girls.” Sofia’s words did not help. 

“You're a girl,” Brian said, turning over in bed. 

“But I’m the exception, besides it doesn’t matter how much of a fool you presented yourself as because I got her number,” Sofia said, peeling off Brian. His attention fixated on her. “That's right the keyboardist gave it to me,” she said, showing the glowing number in her phone contacts. Brian was astonished by what Sofia had accomplished for him. 

“But I made a fool of myself.” Brian’s words wrapped around his pillow as his arms did. 

“Come on, don't be scared, none of that will matter to her, hopefully.” Sofia sat across on her bed thinking. “Just call her tomorrow and say you’ve been thinking of her.” Brian couldn’t even think of saying that to her. 

“That’s even worse than me making a fool of myself,” Brian said, muffled into his pillow. Brian knew exactly what she was gonna say next and was hoping the conversation would just end. 

“Just be yourself.” Sofia’s words came with a pillow launched at her. This angered her as she pulled herself up falling forward onto Brian. She pinned him to the bed. Sofia held a dangled spit above his face. 

“Ok ok I’ll call her!” Brian shouted trying to escape her grasp. Sofia pulled her saliva back into her mouth as she released Brian. 

Brian crawled under his covers trying to ignore his roomate. He pulled his book from his desk, hopeful that he could escape even if only for a moment. They were circled around the war room. Tensions were high as a plan was being devised to catch the rat in his act before everyone took their roles in an upcoming big battle. The world only wrapped around Brian for a couple pages until his mind began to drift as his eyes became heavy. He simply fell asleep. 

Brian wanted to ignore all his alarms but his classes were somewhat important to him especially since he was paying for them. His eyes peeked out from his covers noticing the emptiness in the room. He was alone. Brian quickly pulled together his outfit, brushing his hair behind his ears, and gathering all his things into his backpack. Brian stumbled to the door as Sofia opened it. 

“You call her yet?” Sofia asked as she tossed her backpack onto her bed. Brian rolled his eyes and pushed by her. He had almost forgotten about Amber. The moment she came back into his mind Brian lost all focus for the day. She was all he could think about. Their interaction was small and yet she wouldn’t leave his mind. Brian had three classes today with small gaps between them that consisted of snacks and briskly walking between buildings. He got one text during math. It was Sofia resending Amber’s number. 

The day went by quick. Brian was heading back to his room as a corndog hung out of his mouth. As he opened the door Sofia held a phone to his ear. Brian was confused until he heard a hello. It was Amber’s voice. Brian froze as his eyes went wide. Sofia gently pulled the corndog from his mouth. 

“Hello?” Amber asked, getting a bit frustrated. 

“Oh hi Amber it’s Brian from last night.” Brian’s words came with silence. “I got your number from..” Brian started to draw a blank as his eyes darted to Sofia’s lips as she mouthed words to him. “From Rudy, and I liked talking to you so I wanted to do it again.” There was even more silence than last time. 

“We have a show tomorrow. I'll text you the details,” Amber said quietly. 

“Um this is Sofia’s phone so I’ll text you from mine.” Brian could feel his heart pump fast with each word that left his mouth. 

“Ok sounds good.” Amber’s words fell silent as she hung up. Brian stood frozen in the doorway as Sofia took a bite out of his corndog before sticking it back in his mouth. Brian let the corndog fall out of his mouth and hit the floor. There was a rage of emotions inside him bursting to the surface. “You're the greatest person I have had the pleasure to ever know,” Brian said admiring Sofia as she sat down on her bed opening her laptop. Sofia stuck her tongue out making a fart noise. 

“Try not to be such a word salad around Amber.” Sofia drew her attention to an essay she was in the middle of writing. 

“You're coming with me right?” Brian asked as he closed the door behind him. 

“I’d walk to the ends of the world with you now text me that site you sourced for your history essay.” Brian happily did what Sofia told him to as he opened his backpack pulling out his homework. Brian was still thinking of Amber because of course why wouldn’t he, but he was thinking about Sofia more. They continued in small talk as they worked on their studies.

We love being part of a community and like to be close/walking distance to a downtown or at least a few restaurants/coffee shops if possible. We also need to be accessible to the train in order to commute to NYC. Our budget is around $600k and would like to have a fenced in yard for our dog. 

Based on our research, it appears the Hilton neighborhood in Maplewood could be a good option and some areas in South Orange by Seaton Hall have houses in our price range but I’m not sure about safety in these areas. 

Does anyone have any feedback on the areas mentioned above or other recommendations on good safe areas for young families in SOMA or the surrounding areas?

However, as our adult lives have started to unfold, both of us reaching 26, I've found that our expectations of a friendship have differed.

She's going through a rough time mentally. Admittedly, I've not been around as I've been travelling and just got back a week or so ago. We haven't seen each other in around two months (I popped in to her work to give her a coffee a few days ago just to say hi but apart from that). I've texted her everyday, we called and I am happily open ears when she needs someone to confide in, that's never an issue. I work full time and study full time, leaving me with very little free time. She works part time so has a bit more flexibility usually.

I proposed that we hung out over the weekend but she was busy, and on Sunday she said she is working and would be too tired, so she could meet but she would be exhausted. I was fine with not meeting, we can do another time. 

A few days go by and we're sad we can't see each other, I tell her 'what if we did an hour after you finish work on Sunday, close to your public transport so you can just be home straight after.' She appreciated the offer and we agreed. I also made plans to see some friends that I haven't seen in months afterwards.

A few days later, in mindless conversation, she says 'at least we'll have a few hours together on Sunday!'. I was confused. I said 'oh i thought we were just doing an hour, that's what we agreed? I made plans for afterwards.' 

She was adamant that she did not agree to that and 'why would I meet you for an hour only?' I explained it was because she said she would be tired and sent her the message where we had both agreed. She told me she misread it because she was busy at work when responding. I said 'O**kay well let's just do a different day then where we can have longer together.** She agreed.

Flashback to Saturday. She cancelled her Saturday plans and said to me 'I'm just excited to see you tomorrow, I really need this right now and to socialise.' Again, I'm confused?

'We agreed that we weren't seeing each other tomorrow? I said let's do a different day where we can have longer together.'

She said 'I thought you meant let's do tomorrow **AND** a different day.'

But I never said that, we agreed to do a different day. Am I unreasonable for thinking that a different day means...a different day?

I told her I already made plans, because our plans were cancelled. I said maybe we can do after but it would mean you'd be waiting around for a while or have to travel back in to the city? I told her I'm not  going to cancel on my other friends because she got the wrong end of the stick. To me that's like, letting one friend down for another, especially when it's not my fault that there was all of this confusion? I thought I was so clear she just didn't read what I had said because she was busy, or misinterpreted it. 

Long story short - she sent me some voice notes expressing that I have hurt her and she is going to take some time away from me because she really wanted to see me. She didn't expressly say she's mad I wouldn't cancel my plans but it's implied. The voice notes sort of said, I get why you did what you did but I'm hurt anyway so I'm going to take some time away from you. 

I need some brutal honesty. Would you have cancelled on your other pals and gone to your friend in need after all this? Ordinarily, I would have, a friend in need is a friend in need. But we agreed the plans were cancelled, and I made other plans with other friends who I haven't seen in so long. I feel like this is such a split situation where both sides have valid points, but I am curious on other peoples perspectives, especially given that we are now in our mid-twenties and don't always have time to do the 'ride or die' stuff. 

Am I in the wrong for this?

I (f22) am crushing on a coworker (24m). I am leaving the company I am working at very soon, and am considering confessing or asking him out just before my last day. But now thinking about this I am really agonizing over the question of whether he likes me back or not.

One thing about me is that I have a lot of social anxiety. I have quite a few friends, but they are either childhood friends or were the ones pursuing a friendship with me. It is very hard for me to make an effort in showing that I like someone. Another thing is that I have absolutely zero romantic experiences. I had my first crush only when I was 20 years old and in my last year of university. I also have had very little experience interacting with men in general as I always preferred the company of women.

 This guy is my second crush. I first started crushing on him in August of last year, and we have gotten relatively close since then. Over the last year we have worked together a lot and built pretty good rapport. 

So, I'll just list reasons why he might like me back and reasons he might not.
Reasons he might like me back:
1. He neggs me a lot (is that the right word?). He very (and I mean Very) often makes jokes that are either jabs at me or are meant to frustrate me. They are never offensive or mean, but might irritate sometimes. A minor example could be that I recently went to his department's office and asked if his colleague was there and he immediately replied no, even though the colleague in question was in fact in the office, they were just doing something behind their desk. Or, he also often jokingly questions the quality of my work.
2. He often deletes his messages when texting me. His sense of humor is kind of bad. I think he realizes this, because he sometimes deletes his jokes almost instantly after sending them. I never asked him why he does that, but I think it's because he sometimes realizes how terrible some of his jokes are and cringes at himself for sending them to me. Might be a sign that he likes me.
3. This one might be delusional but I sometimes think he also comes up with reasons to call me or otherwise interact with me. He often asks me questions regarding stuff my coworkers work with, and information my coworkers would be much more knowledgeable about than I am. I usually am able to answer them because I picked up a lot of this info just naturally by sitting near my colleagues and listening to their conversations. Still wondering why he asks me about all of this and not them. 
4. He once sent me money for coffee as a thank you. One time he asked me to help him on a thing unrelated to the stuff we usually work on together. I was not very busy at the time and the thing was very easy so I helped him, and as a thank you he promised to buy me coffee. After a few minutes though he just sent me the money for coffee (???). He was working long distance back then, which is probably why he did that, but I still thought it was a really strange thing to do. I first accepted the money, but then I felt too weird about doing so and decided to send it back with ""I think it's best if you buy me coffee when you are back in the office"". He has replied that it was only a ""one day offer"" and we kind ended it at that. It was very strange and awkward, but it sure was something.

Reasons he might not like me:
1. He often leaves me on read. Very often I am the last one to text something when we are talking over text. It doesn't really bother me but it does make me think that he might not like me after all. 
2. The coffee incident, again. The fact that he offered to buy me coffee was sweet, but him sending me money afterwards and then reacting in the way that he did to my message when I sent the money back was really weird. Kind of seemed like he was blowing me off. IDK tho.

So, those are reasons for/against. I really want to confess to him or ask him out. I do not even hope for anything, but I want to prove to myself that I am able to do something brave like this. However, before that, I want to more or less objectively evaluate my chances. Will be greatful for your opinions.",1,1728330699.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I do not smoke or drink, And I only drink water, tea, and occasionally a cup or two of black coffee.

Ideally you should live in America, and if we hit-it-off, You should be willing to relocate to Western Iowa, where I own my own house in a small country town.

Without going into too much detail, my (18f) best friend (18m) and I have sort of had some romantic tension, if I'm not imagining it. (His brother asked when we're getting married, my dad keeps calling him my bf, etc) I asked him out months ago and he rejected me but we still remained as close as ever. He's so sweet, caring, and respectful. Part of the reason I like him is because he never asked for anything from me- he was the first (straight) guy friend I've had who isn't looking for something more.

Maybe I idolized him too much and I'm just now being brought down to earth, but he really is good, and you'll have to trust me on that. He's helped me through so much, and he's optimistic and sees the good in everyone. He's so wonderful to me and everyone else I see him interact with. He has multiple female friends and treats them just like he would his other friends, so I'm a bit surprised by this.

Well, we were getting coffee the other day and we were talking about relationships and dating culture. We agreed on a lot, but then he started saying stuff like ""women date casually until they get into their 30s and realize the men they're looking for won't put up with them anymore"". Now, he doesn't have any great female role model- his dad had trouble with both mothers of his children, and he really looks up to his dad.

I tried to dismiss what he was saying as projection from his childhood issues, but I can't get it out of my head. I love him a lot (platonically at the very least) so him saying something so disgusting so casually caught me off guard. He was placing the issues with dating culture purely on women and I'm all for holding women accountable, but has he not met ANY shitty men? Has he not seen the plethora of examples of women getting used for sex?

I know he respects me and my opinions, he's told me so. But I hate that he thinks that way, and I don't want to be ""not like other girls"" to him. I don't want to be an exception to a rule that he made up in his head. I still really care for him, and I think he's fundamentally good with some significant bias. This is huge to me, though, and I'm unsure how to proceed. Should I talk with him about it? We've debated on controversial stuff before, and it was all respectful, but this feels like something very personal and I don't know if I'm actually going to change his mind on anything. Is this even worth it? I know there's ""other fish in the sea"" but I've never formed a connection like this with anyone before, and we agree on so much, it's hard to consider that I'd cast him aside for one thing. But this ""one thing"" is how he fundamentally views an entire group of people that I'M A PART OF. Any insight is appreciated 😭🙏",1,1728330419.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

You chase it with hands still dirty from the past, grasping, wanting, and yet it slips through, laughing in a language you’ve long forgotten. But I tell you, there’s a way to catch it, even when your pockets are filled with stones from your childhood, even when the ghosts of those nights press against your skin.

You don’t wait for the grief to dissolve. No, grief is a stubborn lover. It sleeps in the bed beside you, holding your dreams captive, whispering the old stories of your bruises, your broken parts. But happiness, happiness is the thief in the night. It sneaks in between breaths, between the seams of all that sorrow. You must learn to let it. 

I’ve learned that you don’t have to be whole to taste joy. You don’t have to bury the dead parts of yourself to smile. You just have to open a window inside your soul, even if the walls are crumbling. Even if the air is thick with all the things you never got to say. You say it now, anyway. You sing your grief, and in that song, there is a strange, defiant happiness.

Maybe happiness doesn’t come as a grand parade. Maybe it’s not some shining future waiting for you after you’ve bled out every last drop of sadness. Maybe it’s in the cup of coffee you sip while your heart is still raw. Maybe it’s in the way sunlight filters through the trees, even as your past lurks in the shade. 

You hold both. You cradle the pain in one hand, and in the other, you catch the fragile wings of happiness. You let them exist together, because that’s all we have — this messy, tangled thing called life, where joy and sorrow dance in the same breath. And that’s enough.

In April 1912, the RMS *Titanic* sank. We all know this story, of course, but maybe one thing we don't appreciate simply because we take it for granted is that it was reported almost immediately. The *Titanic* went down in water 400 miles from Newfoundland, and yet the news was on the front page of the *New York Times* hours later.

The wireless telegraph was fairly new then. Besides allowing the world to learn of the tragedy quickly, it's also one of the key reasons that roughly 700 passengers survived, and the power of this new technology was fascinating to a lot of people who were paying attention for the first time.

Among those whose interest was piqued was an 18-year-old orphan named Percy Spencer, who had spent his adolescence working in a mill in a rural town in Maine, and who later sought to get as far away from Maine as possible, by enlisting in the U.S. Navy.

When he wasn't standing watch on a ship, he later recalled, he was studying -- first becoming a self-taught expert on telegraph and radio, which led to a better job in the military -- and later adding other scientific subjects, like trigonometry, calculus, chemistry, physics, and metallurgy.

When his enlistment ended in 1925, Spencer did what many military veterans do: he got a job in the defense industry.

His autodidact tendencies continued, and despite his lack of formal education, by the late 1930s, he was one of the leading experts in radar tube design. As chief of the power tube division at Raytheon, he significantly improved the production of magnetrons, which ultimately led to a lucrative contract for the company during World War II.

Toward the end of the war, Spencer was leading a project building magnetrons, when he noticed that a candy bar in his pocket melted. Intrigued that microwave technology might be harnessed for cooking, he started experimenting with other foods.

One early and ironic choice: popcorn kernels, which goes to show that microwave popcorn was one of the first-ever use cases for his new invention.

It turns out, ""invention"" is the right word, because the reason we're discussing this now is that tomorrow, October 8, marks the 79th anniversary of [the patent Spencer got for the microwave oven](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/o8uv08o2qeiqhk0e5z8uvhqr65wrrto/dpheh0h098d6zpcm/aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXRlbnRzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vcGF0ZW50L1VTMjQ5NTQyOUE_bGN0Zz1neHc3MjVkZQ==). Since he was working for Raytheon at the time, his employer got the money; he got a $2 bonus.

Market success didn't follow right away; the first ""radar range"" Raytheon produced was nearly 6 feet tall and weighed almost half a ton, so it wasn't exactly easy to fit in a suburban house.

But, between 1964 and 1965, Raytheon built a legitimate kitchen-sized microwave and bought home appliance maker Amana.

Within a decade after that, Americans bought more microwave ovens than regular gas or electric ovens.

Spencer died at age 76 in 1970. He had more than 150 patents, but as his grandson later pointed out, he passed away just a few years too soon to see just how successful his microwave invention became.

Still, I like this story a lot -- both because I used our microwave to heat up leftover pizza while writing my version of it, and because if the *Titanic* sinking really did spark Spencer's scientific curiosity (he said it did), then it goes to show how even terrible tragedies can lead to unpredictable but good results.

For all of his inventiveness, Spencer wasn't exactly a quote machine, so I'm going to pivot hard and give today's quote of the day to comedian Steven Wright:  

""I put instant coffee in a microwave oven and almost went back in time.""

Just imagine, if it weren't for the *Titanic* tragedy, that joke would have made zero sense.

She’s an architect and likes museums (art, design, history), plus she seems introvert and extrovert both. Think she’s becomes more extrovert after knowing people fully. Im also the same. I open up more once i get to know folks more.

She also told me she only goes out for coffee dates initially but with me, she’s okay with lunch/dinner and just hanging out. She and I both don’t drink so bar’s out of question.

1fygis1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1fygis1/the_story_of_my_haunted_55_chevy/,The story of my haunted '55 Chevy,"Since Halloween is around the corner, and my last story about here blew up, I figured I'd share a story that happened to me personally!

A few years ago, I bought a 1955 Chevy Bel-Air, two-tone sky-blue and white 4-door. It had a high-nickel 350 small block, a Holley 600 carburetor, and a Hurst 4-speed transmission. As a car enthusiast, I was in love with it. Despite my girlfriend at the time and even my mom calling it hideous, I had big plans for it: a fresh paint job, reupholstered seats, and new rims with white-wall tires.

When I first got the car, it had 28,000 miles on it. But as soon as it hit 28,587 miles, the odometer broke and stayed stuck on that number.

About 10 days after I bought the car, strange things started happening. For instance, I’d come home with all the windows up, but by morning, one or all of the windows would be down. Then there was the night I heard a low rumble from the garage. When I checked, the car was idling, even though I knew I had turned it off earlier.

Items like drinks, hats, and tools would disappear if I left them in the car overnight. One night the horn once blared uncontrollably, forcing me to disconnect it to get some peace.

There was one incident where the hood fell on my hand. I ended up needing seven stitches, but that might’ve been my fault. But other things felt more... eerie. Like one time, I was sitting in the car with a buddy, and when I started it, the radio began playing a song that directly tied into our conversation. It was unsettling.

My girlfriend at the time had a best friend who was a medium, and she was terrified of that car. She refused to go near it. She said the car radiated a dark energy, something she couldn’t fully explain. Whenever she visited, I had to park the car facing the wall because my garage had no door, and she’d swear it felt like it was watching her whenever I parked it facing outward.

The activity wasn’t limited to the car either. After I got the Chevy, strange things started happening in my house too. Doors and cabinets would slam, I’d feel cold spots in heated rooms, and there were nights with knocking on the walls. Sometimes, I’d even hear footsteps in the kitchen late at night.

Eventually, a family friend, who’s also into classic cars and had owned several Tri-Five Chevys, offered me $10,000 for the car. Since I’d only paid $8,000, I took the offer. That was in September 2021.

After I sold the Bel-Air, the paranormal activity in my house calmed down, although the house is over 100 years old and still haunted to some extent. But I can’t shake the feeling that the car somehow amplified the hauntings.

A few months ago, I was talking to the new owner. He had fully restored the Chevy, making it into the beauty I had always envisioned. He loves the car, but when I asked him if he’s noticed anything weird, he admitted that every now and then, strange things happen. The oddest incident happened one morning while he was having coffee with his neighbor. His neighbor asked him what he was doing out late the previous night, saying he’d caught a glimpse of the Bel-Air driving down the road and return about an hour later. The new owner, though, swore he hadn’t left the house that night, let alone driven the car.

[The date]We met online and texted for about 2 weeks before the date. We set a date and time to have coffee but he got held up and the time changed a few times. I was a bit worried he was considering canceling but I got over it pretty quickly as it gave me more time to get ready. 

We met at Starbucks, ordered our coffee (he offered to pay but I wouldn’t let him) then walked around drinking and talking for a bit. I enjoyed our conversation and he was more attractive than his pictures. 

When we got back I asked if he wanted to continue talking in his car because it had started to get cold (and I didn’t want it to end). 

We talked and eventually he asked if he could kiss me. We made out for a while and I was rubbing his leg. Eventually he put my hand on his crotch (I love that he took the initiative) and I rubbed it for a bit. I won’t get into too many details because that’s not what this post is about. I’ll just say we went from front seats to back and the date ended with mutual BJs.

We talked for a bit after and set up a second date (1st technically because this one was just a coffee meet up to see if we had chemistry)

1fygcmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fygcmy/my_neighbour_wants_his_son_to_be_friendless/,My neighbour wants his son to be friendless.,"This is a long but interesting one. Thank you if you read the whole thing and give feedback on my situation.

I am in my 20s, and I have a stepson who is soon 8 years old. He loves with me and his dad every other week. He went to a daycare right next to his current school, where he met M, his best friend since they were 4 and 5. When M started school, they didn't see each other much. But a few months before my stepson started first grade, we decided to move closer to his school, to make his life easier.

We went and saw a few apartments for rent, and we found the perfect one for us and our family. Coincidentally our next door neighbour was his best friend from daycare. We had never really talked to his parents other than a few months prior to invite M to my SS (stepson) birthday. We were really happy with the situation as it was, my SS was beyond happy. He and M started playing every day. Every single day after school, M would come over to us, and play with my SS.

They had summer holiday too, and M and their family didn't travel (Ms dad works a LOT!), that meant that M (and a few times a week) would spend the whole day at our house. He would come in the morning, stay with us and play with my SS, until we sent M home in the evening. He would eat dinner with us sometimes (we always offer). They would also play outside, but for some reason they preferred hanging out at our house, even tho our apartment was 1/7th of the size of Ms house.

M is a shy boy, so after a while we started inviting him to go with us to theme parks and outings. My SS really loved it all. We didn't complaint even once about him staying at our house for 10-12 hours a day during the whole summer break (when my SS was with us every other week). We met Ms mom, and she is lovely. She would come over as well and drink coffee at our house, and talk about her home country. She said she felt a bit lonely since she was alone at home every day with the kids, and worked in the basement kitchen every day when the kids were at school/daycare.

We had her over quite a bit, and she also came over and asked if M could stay with us a few hours because she had errands. We always said yes, no problem. Then suddenly we never saw Ms mom, it seemed like she was told she wasnt allowed to come over to our place anymore. She would greet us, but never come over, unless it was to ask us to watch him for a few hours. Which felt so weird since she was so happy about having someone to talk to (she's from another country and said she has no friends here).

Ms dad however. He wasn't always pleasant to deal with. Maybe 2 days after moving in, he said we couldn't drive hard on the asphalt, because it would leave scratches (my fiancé drives normally, and we drove on our landlords property, so we just scratched our heads and said ok). Then he came and told us where we could park and not, and we always parked on the property we rented, we also discussed the parking WITH our landlord the day we moved in, because we didn't want to do anything wrong.

We have since day one had the property lines and a map over our property. We tried to not argue with Ms dad. We kept letting the kids play every day. Ms dad was at work for 12-14 hours a day anyways, so we barely saw him. The other neighbour on our other side was a nightmare, but we were warned about both neighbours before we moved in. But we figured since we did all we could to not do anything wrong, and we had a good relationship with his son, all would be good.

BOY WERE WE WRONG. Suddenly our landlord started letting us know we had gotten complaints about our guests. Because our guests drove cars. And parked on our property. Ms dad didn't like the ""traffic""(?!), we had guests maybe for an hour or two 2ish days a week, mainly my fiancés mom. We always made sure the parking was good, and on the right property. 

Then Ms dad had a huge argument with the other tenant in our house (2 apartments, we live below, and someone else lives over us), and decided to put up a fence around his property so we couldn't park at our parking spot. He got the other neighbour from hell to do it, since they were friends. She just walked on our property and started measuring right outside our windows. We were really uncomfortable. Then she told me I had to move the car. I didn't understand what she was up to until she started drilling holes in the pavement.

It was an agressive tone and she was being really horrible about it all. I have never really talked to her, but she is a huge biatch for no reason. But we knew this, and tried to ignore her. We moved the car, but now none of us renting the house had a proper parking spot. They just drilled and started building without having the city come and properly measure the properties. We called our landlord, but he lives on the other side of the planet and hates conflicts.

We had to park in the middle of our driveway leading to our parking, so we had to park our car behind the other tenants car. So every time someone was going out, the other had to move their car away from the property and let the other out. It was and is a nightmare. All through this, we were still kind to M, and let him stay as much as he liked. He barely wanted to go home in the evenings. 

We have had to park so far from out actual house and walk up the hill where our driveway is. It is super stupid the whole thing. And so exhausting. We didn't make a big deal out of it and kept making sure to ONLY park on our landlords property. Our landlord had the property marked, and both the neighbours had to move their fences since they were both on our property. They did so the same day the man from the city marked the property lines.

This week we had my SS again, but it was a week off school, so we were home. One afternoon, Ms dad came, and was mad at us for parking like we did. He said he could barely get his second car in (which isn't true at all, I've seen him back his second car in). He asked to talk to ""The man of the house"", i got my fiancé. He was mad at my fiancé and told him he had to move our car.

My fiancé doesn't like arguing like that, especially not in front of his son (who was there watching), my fiance just said ""ok"", shook his head and went into the apartment again. I stood there, and then Ms dad threw his hands in the air and yelled at my fiance ""Why doesn't he want to talk?! What is wrong with him!?"". I just told him we arent a big fan of the way things are being handled and that we dont appreciate visits just to get yelled at. And that we have checked up on what we are doing and we are doing what we're allowed to. We're just parking our car, on the property we rent.

He refused to have any of it. I just told him he had to call my landlord and sort it out with him, because we talked to him the day before, and he approved of our parking. Ms dad left upset. 20 minutes later M came to play with my SS. I am so mad at Ms dad for being an asshole. My SS was stressed out, he walked out to our car, and looked around and asked me ""How are we blocking anyone?? I dont understand why he is mad at us"".

He has told the neighbour from hell he wants us to move (6 months ago), which I confronted him about, which he refused to admit he ever said. He came with some story about how happy he was that M had a friend to play with and stuff like that. The 1.5 years we've lived here, M has only had a friend over maybe 4 times in total (my SS and M is in different classes as M is a year older). 

I am convinced Ms dad wants us to move. I don't think he realises how much my SS means to his son, and how good friends they are. I cant ask Ms mom about this either, since I never see her. It is distressing to live like this. But at the same time my SS loves living next to M, and they care so much for each other. They never fight or argue, they always laugh and have so much fun together. 

This whole issue is literally only over parking. We have never said anything bad about M or his family. One time his dad joined an outing with my best friend, her son, my SS, and M. The second I walked away to check on the kids, he talked crap about me and my fiancé to my best friend (this is over a year ago). Like what?! We always treat them well. I dont understand what his problem is. Anyone got a clue?

TL;DR: my two female Bengals aren't accepting my new 6 month old maine coon male. He wants to play and they want to rip his face off if he's looking at them. Don't care about his smell. Can relax in the same area. But if he gets to close, it's on. And they will approach him, then get upset that he's too close. 


I've got two, (3) bengal half sisters and they get along for the most part. One is high strung, anxious and ""the alpha"" of the two. (We'll call her E)The other, frankly, is a smooth brained, autistic spazz that loves her naps and gets down right grumpy when disturbed. (We'll call her MM) Relations though can be strained at times since the high strung one makes it everyone's problem when she gets bored. And rhe other one will will make it your problem if you wake her up without a cup of coffee as a peace offering. (Which means it's always your problem because coffee and cats don't mix, even if she looks like she needs one) To help with this we had the bright idea of getting a 3rd cat, so that there would be someone to play with and cut down on the yoddling and acting out that occurs when she gets bored. (In spite of multiple play times through the day)

Enter our problem. The third we settled on was a 5 month old male maine coon. Conventional wisdom says that males and females have less aggression between one another as long as hormones don't get in the way. We also figured that he would be big enough to handle the rough treatment he was likely to get at the paws of the girls. (They play rough!) And being a mainecoon would also bring some chill to the dynamic. We've introduced the girls to other cats and dogs before and it has never caused issues, so we were confident that this would work.... not so much. He came through the door in his carrier and one started hissing and spitting from 6 feet away (no joke) and the other got to within 4 inches of the carrier before losing it. So into his prepared bathroom he went. The next 24 hours saw the E throwing a tiger sized tantrum. She would growl at *anyone* who came near her, hiss at her sister from 10 feet away and both girls were so upset that we had to separate them regularly. After 12 hours MM had calmed down enough to try and be friends with E again, but E was having none of it. It took 48 hours for any semblance of peace to be restored. The new boy, H, was in his bathroom at all times through this and getting play time with the adults a couple times a day (for an hour or so at a stretch)  once things had simmered down we started making a point of getting his scent on us when we played with him and then going and showering affection on our girls. It started with growls but eventually they stopped caring that we smelled of H. We did intros through a crack in the door, whenever the girls looked interested in what was in the bathroom. And these didn't go very well.  But after 2 weeks of ""what's in there? ... IT'S THAT ONE!!!! HISS SPIT YOWL""  it calmed down to just growls through the crack. We started bringing him out into the living room on a leash or walks around the upper floor of the house, preferably when the girls were down for their naps. After a day or two of this, things seemed to be settling out and we started bringing him into the living room to hang out on a lead for the day. This is where we start having issues. Relations would improve to a point where the girls would play in the same room, take naps on mom in the same room and be fairly chill as long as there was a good amount of space between them and him. The problem is that while  he was limited in his travel, they would walk up into his space and be surprised and upset when he came up to say hi. He body language has always been tail high, ears perked (not forward) and I don't think I've seen a malicious thought cross his mind ever. He is constantly trying to engage with them (along with every person he meets) and they want nothing to do with him. We've seen occasion glimpses of play (MM loves to play with his leash when we let him run with it dragging on the ground. But she gets super upset the moment she realizes that he's attached to the other end), but after an unfortunate incident where E broke and ran to hide and H chased after her thinking it was play time.... that relationship has soured considerably. (She'll start growling at 10 ft and approach him to hiss in his face then leave) MM seems to have plateaued at most of the time with watching him warily as he goes past her so long as it's outside mapping distance. (Which he has gotten good about) however, there are times where he'll be chilling a good distance away and she'll be loaded up in a beam of sun or the like then, suddenly, turn around, charge hissing and throwing paws. Most interactions are with H doing his thing and one of the girls coming in, hissing, spitting, bapping at him while he flops down like he's relaxing or goes loaf while narrowing eyes and ears turned back. (Not flattened) even when he tries to engage in play it's with lots of butt wiggles and telegraphing. If he's spotted and gets ""the look"" he'll subside. If he does do a pounce, it always lands short. He has only thrown paws at MM when she starts mapping at him. Never initiates. It's been over a month now and things seem to only get so good. Last night E smelled his butt while he was eating then ran away. Like, an inch away. As long as he isn't looking at them, it's.... ok? As things stand, we're letting have him free run of the house (supervised) with his leash attached (easy handle if thing go south) whenever possible. When we see tension escalating, we scoop him up and put him back in his corner of the living room (he's on a lead there, so we aren't locking him in his bathroom for cool off periods and so we aren't having to be the anchor point. Then we butter up the girls with pets and love. We play with them all as much as possible. Preferably in the living room. But with an eye to keeping a good separation.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/43fnq58jxdtd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc7911400ddff101355fde10c52d109a6bb8bf0

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1728329075.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

1fyg5au,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1fyg5au/i_now_quit/,I now quit,"I am sick of this. I have known for the last couple of months that I needed to quit, I have been flehmmy, wheezing, especially at night.

Until work from home I was probably smoking just over 10 a day. Since the lockdown and working from home that has progressed to 20 - 25 a day. I was telling myself in my mind, that I am fine. Like, I can still go hiking, still goto the gym, so its not affecting me right?

Well wrong, yeah I can lift some weights and build muscle. But after swapping to classes which are heavy in cardio, I have realised my fitness is shot. I actually felt like I was dying.

What really switched my from the I ""need"" to quit, to I ""want"" to quit was spending some nights with a nurse and have her commenting on my chest and basically giving a diagnosis.

So today I went to the doctors, got prescribed an inhaler and also a blood test as my blood pressure was ""slightly high"".

But yeah, I am dead serious about quitting. I don't even want to do patches or vapes or lozenges. I want to go cold turkey, I know its tougher, but I don't want any nicotine in my system. Something has given me a wake up call.

So the pack I bought a couple of hours ago, I just had my last one and put the rest of the pack under the tap. I don't even know why I bought them. I had 3 in total before putting them under the tap.

Anyway I am posting on here for accountibility. Tonight when I goto bed, I am listening to Paul McKennas ""Quit Smoking"". I will probably post on here tomorrow, ranting about cravings, but its better than lighting another death stick.

Also I am sure its affecting my bedroom performance, since going from a 10 a day to 20+. I just want out of this hell. Its like I am starring in my own horror movie that I am directing myself.

  
Also, I don't have the coffee and cig combo, mine is worst. Its bloody energy drink and smoke. So yeah, thats probably great for blood pressure and anxiety, nevermind the bank account. Working out how much I spend on energy drinks a month is scary. Yet if I don't smoke, I don't crave energy juice. So this will be two stones with one bird. ",6,1728328974.0,stopsmoking,1,1.0,False

1fyg2m2,https://www.reddit.com/r/kingsnakes/comments/1fyg2m2/want_to_make_a_mini_open_enclosurejungle_gym_for/,Want to make a mini open enclosure/jungle gym for my king for outside-enclosure enrichement. Advice? ,"So the basic idea is I think it’d be cool to have a centerpiece for our coffee table/dining table that’s like a little jungle gym that we can let our snake “play” around on and explore on with supervision on handling days. Just an open terrarium for the table where he can climb while we’re playing dnd or board games or something. He generally does very well with handling and he does like to explore and burrow too. I figure it gives him a small environment to hide in or observe from in a change of scenery if he’s not wanting to be handled, and maybe will help us do some choice handling training from. 

General idea is like a wooden sandbox with play sand on the bottom with his coconut fibre substrate over that and a little hide on top, with then a couple platforms going up above it for some verticality. Will probably add some fake plants and leaves and stuff too to pretty it up. Unsure on if it makes sense to give a water dish or not too.

My big questions are:

-is this a dumb idea or a good idea health-wise for our kingsnake? 

-Should I treat or not treat the wood a certain way so it’s nontoxic to him? 

-Should I avoid painting the wood at all? 

-Are there glues I should definitely use or avoid, like hot glue gun glue vs gorilla wood glue? 

-Should I have something between the wood and the substrate to make it easier to clean, and if so any ideas on what? 

-Is there another material that would be better than wood? Considering if 3D printing one would be better and safer. 

Any other ideas or feedback is welcome! ",1,1728328788.0,kingsnakes,0,1.0,False

 *Link to Famous Retirement Angle:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm5c2XBcXo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm5c2XBcXo)

*It’s time for Monday Night Raw! Mark Henry comes out with his infamous pink blazer! He has an announcement; he cuts his infamous retirement speech! Everyone’s crying, Mark’s crying! He leaves the stage and graces the fans for one last time. He is greeted backstage by many and hugs them all! As Henry is walking to the back, he encounters John Cena! He scoffs at Sexual Chocolate and makes a bold statement about him. This enrages Mark who puts his blazer back on and cracks his knuckles. Cena is set to s Kofi Kingston in the main event of the show. He attacks him during his entrance. It’s a brutalization! The match is called off and Kofi is helped to the back. Cena cuts a promo where he finally realizes that he doesn’t need to wrestle every week anymore to entertain. He calls his shots as the WWE is his foundation! He is about to finish his promo before eating a World’s Strongest Slam from Mark Henry! Henry declares that his final match will be against Cena at MITB for the WWE Championship! He’ll take the title with his cold Dead Hands!!!! The crowd erupts!*

*The next week on Raw, Henry reveals his intention on beating Cena, pass it from his cold dead hands from a worthy competitor, then ride out to the sunset! He realizes what Cena has become and doesn’t want the consequences of that cannibal’s actions to destroy the business he loves! He has won the World Heavyweight, European and ECW Titles but not the one that represented all of his dreams! The WWE Championship! Cena comes out and refuses to give Henry a title shot! He has no major prior history with Henry and a man on the verge of hanging up the boots that can no longer adapt to the new generation doesn’t deserve to be the WWE Champion! Henry is livid and tells Cena he’ll have to kill him dead cold to stop him! Mr. McMahon comes out and agrees at Cena’s request. He has a similar mindset as he did to Kofi in 2019. Henry has done nothing to warrant a title shot and is injury prone! He insults Henry and says that he regrets signing him to a 10-year deal 17 years ago! In the words of Obadiah Stane, he had one last golden egg when he introduced the Hall of Pain and became the WHC. Henry couldn’t hold that torch for long! Henry grabs Vince but is then jumped by the Shield. They beat him down gang style! Despite the dogs being hungry, Mark Henry can fight back as a one-man tank! As he nearly devours the Hounds, Cena clocks him hard and he stumbles to a Reigns spear through the barricade. The Hounds strip him off his pink blazer and Triple Powerbomb him through the table! The Shield officially aligns with Cena! The next week, Henry is told if he wants to earn a title shot, he will have to go through hell to “earn” it! Mark is gonna go through his Kofi Mania/Logan arc.*

*Throughout this Vince is kissing his golden boy Cena’s ass. He’s the franchise of the WWE while Henry is just a B+ Player. Henry is forced to compete in 1 on 3 handicap matches against the Shield, dangerous match types every week testing his endurance, etc. Henry loses at first due to his wear and tear but despite his agony slowly starts winning! Mark announces that the Hall of Pain is back, and the last victims will be The Hounds and Cena! Mark becomes a monster to fight the monsters of the world!!!! He promises his young son that he’ll bring that belt home to him! The next week on Raw at his hometown, Mark is put into a gauntlet against various heels and the Shield. Henry beats Rollins first but is jumped by Dean and Ambrose before The Ryback comes out! Henry overcomes them all the heels in an emotional fashion of destruction during the gauntlet but is getting more battered and beat down. He doesn’t know how much left his body can take. Henry has one final opponent in the gauntlet with the undefeated and unpinned Roman Reigns! The young brute who will become the Tribal Chief is beating the tar of the World’s Strongest Man! Henry is losing the battle, but when he looks at his family! He becomes a product of his anger and starts bringing the fight to Reigns! He beats Roman with the most Devastating World’s Strongest Slam ever! 1, 2, 3! Henry’s cashing his final check at the Bank!!!!! Henry wins! He celebrates but is unable to fully stand up! It took a lot out of him as it did Roman. No chance of that's what you got!!!! Vince congratulates Mark! But in shades of New Year’s Revolution 2006, McMahon brings out Cena as the last opponent of the Henry gauntlet! That son of a bitch! Screams J.R! Cena does the thing that his famous rival in Edge did to him. Cena beats the tar out of Cena and locks him in the STF! Henry passes out! Cena wins! Henry sits down devasted near the steel steps. Vince is smirking.*

*The next week on Raw, Mr. McMahon celebrates the fall of Henry! This doesn’t go well with the babyface roster as they all go on strike! Especially the likes of The Big Show, Team Hell No, Randy Orton, etc. Vince ends up in his office later angry over the outcome vowing to punish the babyfaces. The Shield come out for their match against 3MB (since all the babyfaces are gone, Vince  pushes the jobbers who eventually become main eventers. At Least two out of three of them. Sorry The Chick from Wendys Heath : ). Unbeknownst to the wolfpack, Rollins isn't there with them. As the Hounds realize their brother isn't with them, the tron momeintarly shifts to a shaky handhield camera that the Shield themselves use, which shakily follow a small trail of blood across the concrete floor, then spanning to Rollins being snatched by Henry, before it reaches to a blooded Rollins lying on a backstage merch table. Then it cuts and Henry is behind Ambrose and Reigns in the ring having come from the crowd. He introduces them into the Hall of Pain via a hate fueled beatdown. Henry screams ""THATS WHAT I DO!"" He heads backstage, goes to the area where he destroyed Rollins and grabs him by the leg. Mark then barges into Vince’s office by throwing Rollins through the door. He easily dismantles security! He grabs Vince by the collar and drags his scared carcass to the ring! Vince is fearing for his life. He cries to Vince’s he gave 17 years of loyalty to him, and this is what he gets! He demands his rightful title shot after being screwed. Cena comes out and Vince’ s is begging him to stop Henry, but to his surprise, he doesn’t as deep down, he cares for no one but himself! Henry threatens Vince even more before Vince relents and gives him the shot! Henry then thanks his boss calmly before menacing saying, “Welcome to the Hall of Pain”! Mark Henry World Strongest Slam’s Vince grabs a chair and snaps his ankle! Cena is shown shaking for the first time.*

*The next week on Raw, major media outlets and Late-night TV shows cover this storyline. Jimmy Kimmel gets permission to follow the life of Mark Henry. Henry is seen out with his son at an amusement park! Doing the fatherliest things and hugging his son in a heartwarming montage! It gives a sense of innocence in Henry’s life. Jacob Henry in this storyline considering he is now signed to the WWE has a Dominik Mysterio 2005 role which is cool after years. Mark Henry appears as a guest on Kimmel, sharing a heartfelt story of his final run in WWE and what it means to him and his son, Jacob. The segment is filled with touching moments, as Henry talks about being a father and how his journey has inspired his son. Jacob, sitting beside his father, looks on with pride. The audience is drawn into this wholesome side of Henry, a softer side of the ""World's Strongest Man"" that the public rarely gets to see. Suddenly, during the interview, the cameras catch an unusual commotion in the audience. The Shield, dressed in black street clothes, are seen moving towards the stage from the top of each aisle, causing a stir among the crowd. Henry notices them approaching, and his demeanor quickly changes. He stands up, positioning himself protectively in front of his son, and addresses The Shield directly, asking them to back off and reminding them that he’s there with his kid. The Hounds want revenge for his attack last week and destroying honor. Kimmel tries to buy time to distract the audience.*

*Roman Reigns steps forward, ignoring Henry's plea, and Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose follow closely behind. Ambrose is doing all the brutal to cold truth talking. They show no signs of stopping, and the tension in the studio escalates. Henry, seeing that the situation is getting out of hand, takes a moment to make sure Jacob is behind him before making the first move ...... he headbutts Reigns, knocking him back momentarily. The crowd gasps as chaos breaks out on live television.*

*Henry shouts for Jacob to get away, trying to buy him time. Jacob, visibly scared but wanting to protect his father, steps in front of Henry, attempting to shield him from The Shield. Security try stopping the Hounds before being beaten. Jacob's effort is quickly interrupted as the show's security steps in, whisking Jacob away from the confrontation. Jacob screams for his dad, struggling against security, but Henry tells him to go, assuring him that he'll be fine.*

*In the midst of the chaos, John Cena in a suit with the title on his shoulder suddenly appears from backstage, microphone in hand. Cena was Jacob’s second favorite wrestler before the turn. Cena strides onto the set, seemingly amused by the situation. He glances at Jacob being taken away and then turns his attention to the camera. Cena starts berating Henry, speaking directly to Jacob, who is being escorted offstage. He coldly tells Jacob that he shouldn't have idolized his father, that heroes always fall, and that at Money in the Bank, Mark Henry will learn to fear Cena's name. Cena's taunts echo through the studio, his demeanor dripping with arrogance and cruelty. As Cena continues his verbal assault, The Shield pounces on Henry bloodying him up. Henry tries to fight them off, but the numbers game quickly becomes too much. Reigns, Ambrose, and Rollins overwhelm him, beating him down as Cena watches, a smirk forming on his face. The studio audience is in shock, and the Kimmel stands frozen, unsure how to react to the carnage unfolding on what was supposed to be a lighthearted segment. Kimmel tries calling 911 but Cena grabs him by the collar and pushes him off the set.*

*With Henry on the ground, Rollins and Ambrose grab a steel chain they brought with them and tie it around Henry's neck, dragging him toward the stage set. Roman Reigns grabs a chair, and as Henry struggles, The Shield lifts him up for a devastating Triple Powerbomb through the set's coffee table, leaving Henry broken.*

*Cena approaches the fallen Henry, bending down to get in his face. He grabs a microphone and, with a cold expression, tells Henry who face is pouring the bloody crimson mask similar to Punk/MJF '22, that this is just a taste of what’s coming at Money in the Bank. He then stands up, pointing at the camera and making sure Jacob, watching from backstage, hears his next words: ""Your dad is finished. And you'll remember this night every time you think of who your hero really is. Henry is his own next victim in The Hall of Pain that now belong to me as the hunter!"" Cena walks away, The Shield following behind, leaving Mark Henry lying in a heap of broken wood, blood and shattered glass. The scene ends with Jacob breaking free from security, running to his father's side, tears streaming down his face as he calls out for help. The camera zooms in on the young boy, devastated, as he cradles his father's head, the entire situation captured live on TV for millions to witness.*

*The segment gains major media attention, painting Cena as a monstrous villain in the eyes of mainstream viewers, while Mark Henry, now brutally beaten and humiliated, is seen as an underdog who must fight not just for himself, but for his son. Hell at one point, in a TMZ story breakage, Nikki Bella harrases Mark Henry's wife and gets a slap for her troubles before being pulled apart by security.*

 

*On SmackDown, Henry is shown in a hospital bed with his son by his side! He is greeted by his former mentor in Farooq Ron Simmons who is wearing a medical attire. Damn! Henry is elastic for the first time after being beaten within an inch of his life. Simmons takes off the curtain next to Henry’s bed! It’s The Rock! The crowd goes nuts! He hasn’t been seen since Mania 29. He is wearing a neck brace and is bearded with his head looking a little bit patchy like in 2003. The three men had a history in the Nation of Domination! The Rock and Henry have a friendly banter about their friendship. Rock even greets Jacob and entertains him with a mini–Rock Concert dissing Cena! He pulls out his Hercules Rockstar wig (as he was filming that movie and puts it on)! Rock then gets real with Mark cutting the most genuine promo of his in a long time. He wishes Henry luck and to whip Cena’s Lex Luthor Candy Ass! The next week on Raw, Henry is greeted backstage by his friends who have beaten down the Hounds in an undisclosed location giving them a taste of his own medicine. Henry is free to have his contract signing! Both men have a war of words! The match is declared a last man standing match! Henry cuts a similar promo to Dusty’s Hard times and Eddie’s addiction promo to Cena! Henry promises that unlike before when Cena put him out in the gauntlet, he will be the last man standing and induct Cena to the Hall of Pain!! He also promises to kill Cena with his cold dead hands for threatening his son! May the best man win! Cena then nearly lariats Mark before getting a World’s Strongest Slam onto the table! Henry raises the title to the roar of the crowd as Cena lays wasted.*

 

*It's time for Money in The Bank! Pre-Henry’s entrance, an emotional Big Show hugs him while Henry is losing it too! Show offers to help Henry, but Mark tells him it’s a war on his own. Show agrees out of respect! Three 6 Mafia’s “Somebodies Gonna Get It” starts blasting through the arena for an epic pop! Mark has an tribute entrance to his career and is ready for war as the fans sign along Somebody gon' get they ass kicked, Somebody gon' get their wig split, Somebody gon' get they ass kicked, Beat Them Up in unison! Henry’s family and friends are at ringside! Cena makes his entrance to heavy boos. The match is an all-out violent brawl. Mark is in the top of his game while Cena asserts dominance. Some moments of the match occurring are Henry running powerslamming Cena off the announce table through the barricade, Cena stabbing a kendo stick to Henry’s eye. The pain is unreal but like a true badass, Henry is more dangerous than ever! He hits his wound and batters Cena! Everything including chairs, tables, ladders, stage props, barricades, LED boards are destroyed. Cena and Mark are now throwing hands on their needs back and forth. This goes on until Henry’s Strongest Slam is reversed to an STF!!!! Cena has it locked in! Henry passes out! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ……. Henry is back up! On his cold hands!*

*Cena is shaken. Cena goes for the final kill blow with an avalanche Burning Hammer but is reversed into the smoothest World’s Strongest Slam in avalanche fashion off the tope rope! The rings caves in! Both men are down! Henry gets up by the count of 9 ¾ but in a contrasting note, Cena has to pull himself up via the ropes. Henry is irate! He goes for his final blow before he is jumped by the Shield who leave him a broken mess! The Hounds don’t forgive or forget! They triple powerbomb Henry through the announce table! Cena gets the upper hand and pounds Henry’s lights out! Henry’s family watch in horror! The Shield slide the steel steps into the ring! He then goes for the Burning Hammer onto the steel steps! Henry’s ribs face fatality! Henry is choking blood! Fans are seen crying over this! As the count nearly reaches 10, Henry gets back up by sliding out of the ring and using the ropes as leverage. Cena can’t believe it. Henry with all is injuries should be done. But no, his spirit is keeping him in the game! He starts punching the hell out of Henry and no matter what Henry doesn’t fall! He can’t lose! The Shield start to handcuff and chain the WSM up. Cena is getting more desperate and desperate. He does something he hasn’t done before. He tells the Shield to step aside and grabs Henry’s son away. Henry’s wife tries retrieving him but gets shoved by Cena and barricaded by the Shield. Henry starts freaking out and kicks Cena in the leg before being pounced on. Jacob breaks free and tries to get back to his seat, but the Shield barricade the area.*

*The feed then cuts to other wrestlers like Team Hell No, The Big Show, Sheamus, Chris Jericho trying to stop Cena and The Shield but the whole backstage and upper crowd area is trapped and barricaded, but by who’s accord! Bryan with his newly won Raw All-Star Money In The Bank briefcase trying hit the barricade with it but isn’t successful. Cena stares dead cold at Jacob. Jacob tries to attempt running away and runs through one of the giant ladders on the stage representing his childlike innocence! He tries climbing the bigger ladder before fearing heights. He climbs down and climbs to a smaller ladder, unfortunately for Jacob, behind him Cena has climbed the bigger leader and stares at him menacingly. Jacob looks behind and is horrified.  Henry’s wife and family are screaming and begging Cena not to hurt him and a now conscious Henry is now up before the 9 count, realizing the reality of this situation! He thinks “What I have done involving my family here”! “This title does not mean more than my sons’ life!” With one last ray of breath, Henry finally goes into berserker Logan rage and  breaks the chains. He demolishes the Shield with his cold but not yet dead hands! He shows his rage by throwing Rollins off the ringside crashing through the arena floor as fans dump their food on him. Henry collapses and starts crawling to the ring. Flashing to Cena and Jacob, he starts verbally shouting at him becoming the contrast of the man he used to be, making a child’s day. Cena then gives the cutthroat sign of the Deadman who’s streak he ended to Jacob’s family and is ready to Burning Hammer Jacob off the big ladder!! The fans and Henry’s family scream horrifically. Before Cena can grab Jacob from the smaller ladder Henry sacrifices himself and his dreams, and spears Cena off the big ladder through the stage thus saving Jacob! Chaos emerges. The top stage crashes on both.*

*Medics start checking on both men. Jacob gets off the ladder and runs to his Daddy. He begs him to wake up for 10\*\***^(th)* *count, but he can’t! Jacob crying holds his dad’s cold now dead hands. Cena is assisted by the Shield to get up by the 9\*\***^(th)* *count before the 10 ticks! Cena is still the WWE Champion! Henry’s career is over! Cena is helped by the Shield and Nikki. Medics check on Henry. The rest of the roster finally can break in but are too late. They mourn the career of Henry. After a moment of silence, Henry wakes up and hugs his son crying! The fans and commentators and crying! Henry waves goodbye to the fans before being placed on a stretcher riding into the sunset. Post the show as Cena is being helped by the Shield into his limo, a familiar Apex Predator of a Viper sheds his camouflage skin and stares down the limo.*",1,1728328754.0,fantasybooking,0,1.0,False

I’m trying to figure out if I’m a bad friend. So I’m a part of a close friend group of three. One friend has a birthday tomorrow and my other friend is discussing what she got her with me. So far, shes got her an Apple Watch, $50 boots, a $135 bouquet of roses, and a $160 Anthropologie jumpsuit. She’s not rich btw and I assume a lot of this is going on a credit card.

I plan to cover the dinner/coffee shop we go to on her birthday. Normally, we would split birthday expenses, but this seems like a lot.  For example, in February for my birthday, we just went out to eat and got coffee. Also, we’re all 21 and in college.

Every second felt agonizing, every second until the deadline keeps adding up to his stress. The monotonous sound of the clock is broken up by someone knocking, which makes Sensei raise his head to look at the door.

""Sensei☆! May I come in?"" A sweet voice chimes in, almost sounding melodic, it could've been none other than Nonomi herself. ""The doors open."" ""Ok☆!"" She opens the door by turning the handle, and when she gets inside the room there's a whole mess that is beheld in front of her eyes, as well as her dear Sensei being clearly exhausted, and with a cup of coffee that clearly has run out of its effect on his bloodstream.

""Us students have relied on your help for far too much, so now how about we help you instead? Sounds good, right?"" ""I suppose so."" ""Now then, Sensei, how about I help you out with the paperwork?""

Now it seems like everything is going smoother, someone that he can depend on lest he gets something wrong, and someone that can break the monotonous rhythm of the clock ticking... Time seems to pass faster for him while Nonomi is around, minute by minute... 

""Done☆! Now then Sensei, let's wind up!"" ""Damn right I will..."" They both go up to Schale's lounge, sitting on the sofa, Nonomi sits straight while Sensei plops down on it.

""Good night... Sensei."" She then ruffles his hair to lull him into sleep, watching as his consciousness slowly slip out, her heart feels content... ""Maybe this is what love feels like. Hehehe☆...""

1fyfsu0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fyfsu0,What I ate in 72 hours in New Mexico for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.,"My husband and I flew into Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA for the 52nd annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta this past weekend.

I have Celiac disease and this time we got a regular hotel room without a kitchen because we were only staying 72 hours. 

(I have all of these places bookmarked in a shared Google Map for New Mexico on my Linktree that is linked on my Reddit profile.) 

New Mexico is famous for their red and green chili peppers, especially their Hatch chilies. Hatch chilies are just Anaheim peppers that are grown in the Hatch region of New Mexico. 

New Mexican food is an American regional cuisine that features chilies (that aren't very spicy) and cheese on dishes that rely primarily on what would be considered ""Mexican"" ingredients. When asked ""red or green"" that is a question asking which chili sauce you want on your food. If you'd like both red and green sauces on your food, you reply ""Christmas.""

⚠️ Many New Mexican restaurants add a gluten roux to their chili sauces so you always have to ask first if it's gluten-free. Do not assume.

⚠️ You must ask for your corn tortillas to be steamed to avoid cross contamination. Always ask if their corn tortillas are gluten-free as some add wheat as a filler.

$15.50 lettuce wrapped green chili burger with side salad, $6 ""bowl"" of chicken posole & $6.50 Sandia watermelon cider. 

They had to bring me a new side salad because it came out with croutons. I asked that my husband get to keep the mistake salad so that they didn't just pick off the croutons and bring it back out.

$21.53 beef barbacoa smothered tater tots. Red chile beef over house made mashed potato tots and topped with cotija cheese and scallions.

This was at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta at 5 AM. There were no other gluten-free options and this booth was marked gluten-free on their signage.

We stopped by a 100% gluten-free bakery in Albuquerque. My husband and I shared a $4.25 vegan green chili & cheese scone and a $4 vegan chocolate chip cookie sandwich. We also purchased two cinnamon rolls to take home.

McDonald's USA is not gluten-free. They add wheat to their fry oil for flavor, so even if they had a dedicated fryer, it's not gluten-free. 

The only really safe option is an ice coffee. I ordered for mobile pickup and was scared because there were people actively doing drugs around the car as a dealer did a deal right in front of the mobile pickup spots. It was not a good area of town despite being super close to the Costco we were going to.

I found a gluten-free blog awhile ago who mentioned this local chain so I bookmarked all of the locations on Google Maps. Unfortunately they've gotten rid of most of their gluten-free menu, so I had very few choices on their dinner menu. 

I got the $12 green chile margarita and the $17.95 large range chicken platter. The platter consists of 2 grilled chicken breasts, white corn tortillas, chile con queso, chopped green chile, melted white cheddar, avocado, salsa, black beans and arroz verde.

Visited a 100% gluten-free restaurant in Santa Fe, the capital city of New Mexico. It was great not having to worry about cross contamination. 

I ordered the $18 stacked chicken enchiladas with jack and cheddar cheese, served in blue corn tortillas and smothered in sour cream, and red and green chilies. Served with black beans and green rice.

My husband ordered the $15 huevos rancheros, which is blue corn tortillas, eggs, cheese, sour cream and chili sauce. 

We shared a $8 bowl of turkey tortilla soup and the $8 tres leches cake.

I had spiced and goat cheese truffles and hot chocolate from the Salem, Massachusetts location in October 2021. It was so good I went 2 days in a row despite the fact my hotel room was in Providence, Rhode Island. Their only locations are in Santa Fe and Salem currently. 

We got these to bring home and haven't eaten them yet but it's too good to not mention. Almost everything is marked gluten-free.

I ended up getting 4 goat cheese and sage truffles ($4.25 each) while my husband got a green chile caramel $3.50 and a cherry chili truffle. They were marked gluten-free.

1fyfmg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arecipe/comments/1fyfmg0/easy_peppermint_oreo_balls_recipe/,Easy Peppermint Oreo Balls Recipe,"Looking for a simple yet delicious treat to make this holiday season? **Peppermint Oreo Balls** are the perfect choice! These no-bake delights combine the rich taste of Oreo cookies with a refreshing hint of peppermint, all covered in a smooth chocolate shell. With just a few ingredients, you can create a festive dessert that’s great for gifting, parties, or simply indulging at home.

In this article, we’ll guide you through the step-by-step process of making these delicious peppermint Oreo balls, along with some tips and variations to make them even more special.

**Why You’ll Love Peppermint Oreo Balls**

Peppermint Oreo Balls are incredibly easy to make, yet they look and taste like a gourmet treat. The combination of crushed Oreos, cream cheese, and peppermint creates a rich, creamy filling, while the chocolate coating adds a satisfying crunch. The hint of peppermint adds a refreshing twist, making these treats perfect for the holiday season. Best of all, they’re no-bake, which means you can whip them up in no time!

**Ingredients for Peppermint Oreo Balls**

Here’s what you’ll need to make these festive peppermint Oreo balls:

* **1 package (14 oz) Oreo cookies** (crushed)
* **1 (8 oz) package cream cheese** (softened)
* **1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract**
* **12 oz white chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate**ﾠ(melted)
* **Crushed candy canes or peppermint candies**ﾠ(for garnish)

**Step-by-Step Recipe for Peppermint Oreo Balls**

**Step 1: Crush the Oreos**

Place the Oreo cookies in a food processor and pulse until they form fine crumbs. If you don’t have a food processor, you can put the cookies in a resealable plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin.

**Step 2: Mix with Cream Cheese and Peppermint Extract**

In a large mixing bowl, combine the crushed Oreos with the softened cream cheese and peppermint extract. Mix until the ingredients are fully combined and the mixture is smooth. The dough should have a thick, sticky consistency.

**Step 3: Form the Oreo Balls**

Using a small cookie scoop or spoon, scoop out small portions of the mixture and roll them into 1-inch balls. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Once all the balls are formed, refrigerate them for about 20–30 minutes to firm up.

**Step 4: Dip in Chocolate**

Melt the white or semi-sweet chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring every 30 seconds until smooth. Using a fork or dipping tool, dip each Oreo ball into the melted chocolate, making sure it’s fully coated. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off before placing the ball back on the parchment-lined baking sheet.

**Step 5: Garnish and Set**

While the chocolate coating is still wet, sprinkle the tops of the Oreo balls with crushed candy canes or peppermint candies. This adds a festive touch and a bit of extra peppermint flavor. Let the chocolate set completely by placing the Oreo balls in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.

**Tips for Making the Best Peppermint Oreo Balls**

1. **Chill the dough:** Make sure to chill the Oreo balls before dipping them in chocolate. This helps them hold their shape and makes them easier to work with.
2. **Use high-quality chocolate:** For the best flavor and texture, use high-quality melting chocolate or chocolate chips. White chocolate, dark chocolate, or semi-sweet chocolate all work well for this recipe.
3. **Add food coloring:** If you want to make these treats even more festive, add a few drops of red or green food coloring to the white chocolate for a fun holiday look.
4. **Peppermint variation:** If you love an extra peppermint kick, you can also add crushed candy canes to the Oreo mixture itself for more texture and flavor.
5. **Store properly:** Store these peppermint Oreo balls in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They will keep fresh for up to a week, making them a perfect make-ahead treat.

**Why This Recipe Works**

The combination of Oreo cookies and peppermint extract creates a delightful balance of rich chocolate flavor and refreshing mint. The cream cheese binds the ingredients together, giving the filling a smooth, truffle-like texture. The chocolate coating adds a satisfying crunch, while the crushed candy canes on top provide a festive touch and an extra burst of peppermint flavor. This simple recipe delivers maximum taste with minimal effort.

**Serving Suggestions for Peppermint Oreo Balls**

* **For holiday gatherings:** Serve these Oreo balls as part of your dessert spread at holiday parties. They’re easy to grab and eat, making them a hit at any event.
* **As gifts:** Package these treats in a festive box or tin for a homemade gift that’s sure to delight friends and family.
* **With hot drinks:** Enjoy these peppermint Oreo balls with a cup of hot chocolate, coffee, or tea for a cozy, indulgent treat.

**Conclusion**

**Peppermint Oreo Balls** are the perfect no-bake treat to celebrate the holiday season. With their rich Oreo filling, creamy chocolate coating, and refreshing peppermint flavor, they’re sure to become a favorite dessert for your family and friends. Whether you’re making them for a festive gathering or giving them as gifts, these easy-to-make treats are guaranteed to impress.

1fyfl5y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fyfl5y,What I ate in 72 hours in New Mexico for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.,"My husband and I flew into Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA for the 52nd annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta this past weekend.

I have Celiac disease and this time we got a regular hotel room without a kitchen because we were only staying 72 hours. 

(I have all of these places bookmarked in a shared Google Map for New Mexico on my Linktree that is linked on my Reddit profile.) 

New Mexico is famous for their red and green chili peppers, especially their Hatch chilies. Hatch chilies are just Anaheim peppers that are grown in the Hatch region of New Mexico. 

New Mexican food is an American regional cuisine that features chilies (that aren't very spicy) and cheese on dishes that rely primarily on what would be considered ""Mexican"" ingredients. When asked ""red or green"" that is a question asking which chili sauce you want on your food. If you'd like both red and green sauces on your food, you reply ""Christmas.""

⚠️ Many New Mexican restaurants add a gluten roux to their chili sauces so you always have to ask first if it's gluten-free. Do not assume.

⚠️ You must ask for your corn tortillas to be steamed to avoid cross contamination. Always ask if their corn tortillas are gluten-free as some add wheat as a filler.

$15.50 lettuce wrapped green chili burger with side salad, $6 ""bowl"" of chicken posole & $6.50 Sandia watermelon cider. 

They had to bring me a new side salad because it came out with croutons. I asked that my husband get to keep the mistake salad so that they didn't just pick off the croutons and bring it back out.

This was at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta at 5 AM. There were no other gluten-free options and this booth was marked gluten-free on their signage.

We stopped by a 100% gluten-free bakery in Albuquerque. My husband and I shared a $4.25 vegan green chili & cheese scone and a $4 vegan chocolate chip cookie sandwich. We also purchased two cinnamon rolls to take home.

McDonald's USA is not gluten-free. They add wheat to their fry oil for flavor, so even if they had a dedicated fryer, it's not gluten-free. 

The only really safe option is an ice coffee. I ordered for mobile pickup and was scared because there were people actively doing drugs around the car as a dealer did a deal right in front of the mobile pickup spots. It was not a good area of town despite being super close to the Costco we were going to.

I found a gluten-free blog awhile ago who mentioned this local chain so I bookmarked all of the locations on Google Maps. Unfortunately they've gotten rid of most of their gluten-free menu, so I had very few choices on their dinner menu. 

I got the $12 green chile margarita and the $17.95 large range chicken platter. The platter consists of 2 grilled chicken breasts, white corn tortillas, chile con queso, chopped green chile, melted white cheddar, avocado, salsa, black beans and arroz verde.

Visited a 100% gluten-free restaurant in Santa Fe, the capital city of New Mexico. It was great not having to worry about cross contamination. 

I ordered the $18 stacked chicken enchiladas with jack and cheddar cheese, served in blue corn tortillas and smothered in sour cream, and red and green chilies. Served with black beans and green rice.

My husband ordered the $15 huevos rancheros, which is blue corn tortillas, eggs, cheese, sour cream and chili sauce. 

We shared a $8 bowl of turkey tortilla soup and the $8 tres leches cake.

I had spiced and goat cheese truffles and hot chocolate from the Salem, Massachusetts location in October 2021. It was so good I went 2 days in a row despite the fact my hotel room was in Providence, Rhode Island. Their only locations are in Santa Fe and Salem currently. 

We got these to bring home and haven't eaten them yet but it's too good to not mention. Almost everything is marked gluten-free.

I ended up getting 4 goat cheese and sage truffles ($4.25 each) while my husband got a green chile caramel $3.50 and a cherry chili truffle. They were marked gluten-free.

He says, “You wanna start a race war? These white people have no manners, you never walk between two men having a conversation and not say ‘excuse me’.”

I was shocked to say the least! I’m Canadian and pride myself on my manners and respect for others, and I’m never been spoken to like this. 

He later mentioned to his friend that he’d been in prison for selling drugs, and my best guess is that the respect / segregation aspect of prison life is deeply engrained in how he handles himself. I can also understand the nuance, sort of like how saying please and thank you is something I’d expect my kids to say when talking to strangers.

And then I can add plants and art that has a bit more colour (orange, pinks etc) to brighten it up a bit more. I know lighting is also a big part of this so any lamp suggestions would be great too. 

Any suggestions on making it warm? Should I keep the rug or get a bigger one? If so, what colour or style recommendations? ",5,1728326557.0,interiordesignideas,13,1.0,False

We'll be staying in a converted camper for 3 nights. There is a small fridge with a separate freezer section, a electric hotplate with two burners, a toaster oven, microwave, coffee machine, and a working sink in camper's the kitchenette.

My hope is to pack ingredients along with is so that we can make the majority of our meals together rather than going out for everything. We love cooking together!

Beyond that though, I'm stumped. I'm feeling less inspired than usual and drawing a blank as I sit here pondering my grocery list. I'd like to keep things seasonal, and keep protein costs down. Doesn't have to be fancy but we enjoy a tasty challenge. Wouldn't mind having ingredients for a nice cider-based cocktail or something as well.

I was not 'on' this ship, but I could see in it. There were blue skinned people there, who were operating advanced computers. I remember one of them talking about ""setting parameters"" to go to Earth. As soon as they did, the ship morphed through space and it felt like they just came from far away although it lasted only a few seconds. 

Then what I find even more interesting. There was a human(?) there, wearing a black business suit. As I was seeing him, he sometimes shone gold, and that was all I could see. A gold light emanated from this man, but I'm not sure what that really means. He was standing, what I think to be the front of the ship, with huge glass windows, that you can see through, into space.

He seemed charismatic and was talking to me, although I do not remember what was being said.

These blue people did not shine gold, the human did, and he seemed the leader of them.

I’m new to Squarespace and have been working on customizing my website.

I’d appreciate some insights on a few things. If anyone knows what plugins these are or, alternatively, has any CSS I can implement myself, that would be fantastic.
To clarify, I’ve attached images to elaborate on each of my questions.

Journal Section:
I’ve attached two images to help explain my questions. I’m unsure whether the layout is a blog post or a summary block, but it appears to link to blog posts. I’d like to replicate this look, displaying a list of my blog posts with just text and no images. Additionally, I want a small pill-shaped label highlighting the category beside each blog, and when hovering over a topic, an arrow should appear.

Navigation Bar Drop-down:
One of the attached images relates to this. I’d like to add an arrow that appears when clicking on the drop-down menu, along with square bullet points for each nested page.

Blog Post Section (Journal):
I’ve attached three images here. My questions are:
1. Is the header—showing the picture, date, and social media links—a custom block, or is it built by adding multiple blocks to create the design?
2. It seems there’s a summary page with a pill-shaped label that I’d like to implement on my site.
3. I’d also like to add a “Continue Reading” section at the bottom of the blog post, similar to what’s in the image, to allow users to browse through other posts. 

About Section:
There’s one attached image for this section. Is the layout a summary block with an image beside it, or is it built using text blocks, image blocks, and lines?

I’ve been a hypochondriac pretty much all my life, starting from when my parents divorced when I was little, it just triggered so much worry in me.

Anyways, about 3 weeks ago I had a weird feeling of anxiety I’ve never had before where I felt like I had too much energy in my body and my head had a feeling of nausea (yes nausea but in my head). The next day I was okay but I kept feeling like I couldn’t breathe on occasion and one time I nearly hyperventilated because I was in a muggy car with no AC after it had just rained.

All of this contributed more to my anxiety, and they did an X-ray of my lungs and said everything looked normal but had a point of question where they thought they saw a possible 15mm nodule. So I was freaking out for a day and trying to figure out what was up with my breathing. But went to the doctor and we determined it was most likely my acid reflux acting up and causing extra gas to push on my diaphragm and acid causing my throat to be irritated and inflamed causing a feeling of tightness.

I got medication and an inhaler, and it helped a lot. But after my hyperventilation I just felt so weak and anxious for the next couple days leading me to stop working out regularly.

Then after that, my breathing has gotten better, but I’ve been getting what I can only describe as silent migraines that make me just feel a little off, and they’re always accompanied by anxiety, and I feel that I have tension in the back and sides of my neck. 

Now, when I was younger I would get ocular migraines causing a blind spot to form in my vision that would happen about once a week and last for about 15 - 20 minutes accompanied by slight pain.

Today, I didn’t eat breakfast and got a latte (I don’t drink coffee often) and the latte caused me to feel weird leading to anxiety, my breathing was fine, but I got a “silent migraine” accompanied with a spot of aura in my vision. And it made me not feel like eating.

Well I got worried and got lead down a rabbit hole of looking up brain tumor symptoms and the next thing I know I’m nearly having a panic attack while reading about someone’s story if their wife having a brain tumor, with some symptoms I’ve felt before like “flutters” in the brain, that with the fact that brain tumor headaches can feel like tension headaches and cause weakness has just made me worried to death.

Someone please tell me I’m overreacting and that I shouldn’t worry, I’m just so scared that I have terminal brain cancer and it hasn’t been caught yet.",1,1728326239.0,HypochondriasAnon,1,1.0,False

Just bear with me and spare me with this post. 

32yo female and single. Priority for now is myself, take care of myself, earn money, also just got a new job. Hindi ako yung person na avoids relationships. Who am I to deny myself the joy of appreciating someone that I find attractive?

Ako din yung bata na lumaki na nagconsume ng 90s romcoms and digested the concept of destiny in romance films, na I want that for myself one day.

It happened just this weekend. What if di ako bumangon ng 3pm (midshift ako and adjusting pa ako sa work schedule)? What if di ako bumigay sa mendokoro cravings? What if sa Ayala Triangle ako nagkape at hindi ko naalala na madadaanan ko pala ang Habitual Coffee and get my favorite spanish latte there?

As a woman in her 30s, I still have issues but I am mature now in the area na I am very satisfied with how I look. I am what I am and it is what it is. Naniniwala din ako na there is someone for everyone and lahat may itsura. Walang pangit sa paningin ko. So, let's get  it out there: this is not a issue of insecurity or shyness. I don't need your tips and quotes from self-proclaimed self-help gurus. Spare me. Bear with me. Let me yap.

Ayun na nga. I won't deny myself the pleasure of appreciating someone who is attractive. That I find attractive. Exactly my type. 

Nakita ko siya sa said coffee shop. Nakatutok sa laptop. Na appreciate ko kaagad ang itsura niya. Pogi. Highest honor from me, I guess, kasi pag cute, ""ah okay"" lang makukuha mo sakin. Said my order sa counter. For take out. Tumabi ako while waiting and nakita kita na galing ka CR. Matangkad. Around 5'10 to 11 max. Pasok. Or probably ovulating ako.

Mej matagal ang order ko pero napalingon ako sa'yo at packing up ka na and our eyes met. Startled ako. Ayaw ko lang din ata na lumabas na tinititigan kita. Which is hindi btw.

You passed by me as you got out of the shop and that was it for me. At least, nakakita ako ng gwapo today.

Got my order and sakto when I turned around to leave, andun ka sa tapat and I know nagchange ka ng daan sa Leviste to Toledo, but now pa Sedeño ka na. Pasok ang delulu mode ko and meet-cute scenarios na di ko sure nagising sa singit singit ng isip ko. (Writer po pala ako. Aspiring. 10+ years ago. I wrote romance fanfictions. Read romance novels as a hobby. Again, spare me lol).

Pero realistic ako. Umayos ka, gurl. Bumaba na ako ng short stairs and nasa harap ka na at nauna maglakad. For some reason, ayaw ko ma assume na sinusundan kita. Tumawid ako sa kabilang side ng Sedeño. Ikaw pa Paseo Center, me pa PSBank office.

Nasa crossing na tayo ng Valero, pwede na ako mag cross kaya nauna na ako. Nakikita pa din kita sa peripheral vision ko na diretso ka din sa underpass pa Triangle Park. And you were keeping up pace with me. Again, daydreaming ang peg. Internal sampal with myself pa katotohanan.

Nung pababa na ako ng hagdan, nakita kita na nakatingin sa direksyon ko, as if waiting if bababa din ba ako ng hagdan. You were 5secs away from the stairs sa side na yun. But again, I ignored. Guni guni ko lang ata.

Nung nakababa na ako and was about to turn right sa underpass, I heard very loud footsteps coming down. I saw the reflection sa glass panel ng escalators yung shoes mo: low cut air jordans in aquatone. For some reason, nagproceed lang ako to cross. Again, ayaw ko mag assume at baliw lang ako. Yata.

Hindi na ako lumingon hanggang sa pag akyat. Until now, di ko pa din ma figure out as to why.

Pero eto yung sising-sisi na ako. Na for sure hindi ito gawa-gawa ng illuminati. Few steps away from the entry of the park, under the shade of the trees, you caught up with me. Napansin ko na you slowed down. Nag short run ka and you stopped sakto sa left side ko and you looked down on me. Kaso I was looking at my phone. It was a minute or two but you walked away. Naglakad ka na pa Ayala Ave and I stood there, stumped and sat at the nearby bench that I can reach; bipolar din kasi ako and I need to breathe.

Medyo shunga pero tumayo ako at naglakad sa aisle of restaurants and sabi ko if magmeet kami sa underpass entry to Greenbelt, meant to be kami.

And dahil shunga, wala na siya doon. Ni hanggang pagtawid di ko na siya nakita.

So para kay man with short wavy hair, wearing a long sleeve jacket with dark green and white jacket back, and aquatone low cut air jordans: interesado po ako. Gusto ko lang na mameet kita ulit. Magpakilala. Matahimik lang kaluluwa ko. Didistansya naman if di interested or off limits. At no issues if gawa gawa lamang ng imahinasyon ko. 

I just really need to get this off my chest. Also, I did not create this account to chase a fairy tale, meet cute story of a lifetime. But I really just want this feeling out there.",1,1728326222.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

Winner is Dave's, no contest. So much more coffee flavor than the other two and just the right amount of sweetness. Surprisingly also the thickest syrup. The color was a little brighter too. And the syrup was also the best when tasting by itself, would be great as a topping on ice cream. 

Autocrat is the old standard but tasting side by side with the others it was a little too sweet. Slimo was the thinnest syrup by far of the three and was somewhat bland at the ratio used. When I added another tablespoon it was much better, very similar to autocrat but less sweet.

Both Dave's and Silmo are made from cane sugar, autocrat is made with high fructose corn syrup. All were around the same price, Dave's $9.99, silmos $8.99 and Autocrat $7.49, but autocrat was double the size, 32oz vs 16oz of the other two.

On our first date i voiced how i didnt agree with opposite gender friendships while in a relationship. She then also clearly voiced that she actually had a boy bestfriend at the moment and that they had been friends for some months now. We talked some more about theyre friendship and after hearing about it, i voiced to her that there was no way he didnt have at least a slight crush or have other intentions other than just being her friend. She disagreed but admitted that he did when they first met admit to having feelings for her but she quickly rejected those feelings and said that she saw him as just a friend.

Now moving to present day, since i first met the guy and was introduced his energy was really off and he wouldnt conversate with me. I tried i really did , i would talk to him and attempt to start a conversation and he would answer in one or two words and stay quiet after that. We went to lunch as a group once with the guy bestfriend and some of her other female friends, the girls went outside the restaurant to smoke and my girlfriend left her phone facing up next to me. ( me and her boybestfriend were left inside alone with eachother ) after a few minutes of akwardness he msged her ( not knowing she left her phone next to me ) saying “ why would you do this to me 😭 “ i didnt mean to read the message but it just popped up and the phone was unlocked showing the message fully.   

Moving forward hes just shown complete uninterest in having a relationship with me so i gave up. I should also mention that he would randomly pop by her house to visit or bring her a gift like coffee / donuts randomly. They would also go out to eat alone for brunches or dinners. 

 Eventually this all caught up to me and i felt i had to voice how it made me feel. So i voiced how it made me feel but also told her i was willing to compromise, i said id be okay with group setting type stuff but no more one on ones. I also said that shes not wrong if she disagrees with my mindset but that it just wouldnt work out between us in the long run bc i dont see myself being okay with the one on ones ever. She listened and she was very understanding and said “ thank you for voicing that to me, i didnt realize i was making you feel that way. Ill talk to him ( her bestfriend ) and if hes really my friend hes gonna understand, if he doesnt understand then he doesnt need to be in my life “

After hearing that i felt great and ready to move forward but then some time after she sent me a msg telling me she was gonna go to lunch with him just letting me know so theres no issues, i then told her that that was not what we agreed to that we had said no more one on ones. That she was basically letting me know she was gonna cross a boundary we set. We argued a bit about it then she ended up saying sorry. And she said she now sees my side because she wouldnt want me going on 1 on 1 dinners with a girl either. 

Moving forward we came to conflict again because she got out of work and called him for a ride home. 
It was around time for her to be off and i asked her if she was home yet, she then said no almost though im just grabbing food. Then i asked who picked you up? She then told me she had asked her friend, Instead of coming to me. When i asked her about it and why she didnt ask me , she said she didnt want to bother me and that she was going to tell me that she asked him but she hadnt because he had not gotten there for her yet. ( she lied because she was already in the car with him ) 

The lie created more conflict and she ended up venting about our argument to him, giving him all of the details and he villainized me to her right away 

When i found out she told him about everything it created more confict. We eventually fix things and she says sorry. That she would communicate better to me next time. And keep our problems to ourselfs ( unless she feels completely stuck and needs an outside view ) but she agreed that it was wrong to vent to the person that the whole argument was about to begin with

And now i recently found out that she asked him for a ride the next friday after the argument we had and was blowing up his phone almost begging him to pick up so he can go get her. I also found out that she gave him alot more info than what she told him. She said she only told him that i wasnt confortable with 1 on 1s but she didnt tell me that she was basically sending him every reply i was sending her. And asking him for advice on what she should say.  I dont know what to do anymore and im having alot of internal battles feeling kind of lost on what direction to take. Please help

Last year I was able to reduce it and to get on with my life not paying much attention to my physical symptoms or anything. Now recently I had a very stressful few months of constant working, excessive caffeine and fast heart rate. Due to the stress I never paid attention to this but now that I have a moment to reflect I've become very fearful.

My heart feels weird and weak, it feels like these months of stress and basically no physical activity has ruined my heart in the time span of 6 months. I was going over some of my medical reports and found that one said ""**minor (physiological) mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation**"". I've got a fast heart rate and feel out of breath easily. It's hard to tell if its anxiety or if somethings actually wrong with me... Suddenly stopping coffee and taking a break suddenly made me hyperaware of this. 

I sometimes feel during the night that my heart acts weird, going very slow or weak and then going faster again. I've done long those 24h tests and always without an issue. I'm just worried this has changed over a 6 month period of extremely unhealthy habits. 

I'm now convinced I will die and very scared. I would want to get it checked again but doctors don't want to see me anymore and I've got a student exchange coming up (I'm a 20 year old male) and so won't have the time to go to the doctor.

These nights I've woken up with fear and anxiety I will die and often feeling like my heart skips a beat. I'm really scared I will drop dead at some point.

1fyey3g,https://i.redd.it/favxhx7jodtd1.jpeg,It has been an year so far!,"I bought the first one (Hugo Boss- The Scent) in June 2023 and have been spending gradually on this collection ever since. I am more towards warm, spicy fragrances as you can tell looking at the collection with a few spends on fresher side for the hot summers, although I still comfortably wear winter frags anytime.

Please find the reviews below:

MYOP Aqua Marine: Got this one from a popular store in Bangalore. Its fresh, aquatic and citrusy. The fragrance is not amazing but the sillage, projection and longevity is great.

Zara Man Silver: Supposed to be a clone of Gucci Guilty, does the job well for its price. Surprisingly the only Zara fragrance that I liked having tried many as it performs excellently on my skin.

Boss The Scent EDT: A great mix of citrus, floral, warm and fresh notes. I love it although it does not last that long (and the SS guy gave me an EDT after sampling an EDP). Projection and sillage is average for this one

YSL Y: No wonder everyone talks about this fragrance all the time. Absolutely fantastic.

Dior Homme Intense & Parfum: Love both of them, lots of iris, powdery, woody feel with the DHP taking my vote for the better one with its amazing base of oud, earthy and rose notes which smells amazing and lasts an eternity.

Dior Sauvage Parfum: This one was a blind buy although I like Elixir better, but this one is a classic, and anyone who tells you Sauvage is overrated is lying. Its a perfect blend of fresh, spicy notes with lots of citrus notes along with hint of vanilla.

Terre D’Hermes Eau Givree: Absolute standout, feels like an ocean of lemons, extreme citrus, fresh mineral notes, great for summers.

Salvatore Ferragamo UOMO Signature: This is a powerhouse of a fragrance for winters. It feels so warm, spicy and gives you that fire in chilly winter evenings. It has leather, pepper notes, bit of citrus and coffee notes as well and dries down well. Great sillage and projection.

Bulgari Man Wood Essence: This is there in the collection only because of the distinct smell it offers. This one smells like a wet monsoon forest and I love it. The sillage and projection is above average but lasts good 5-6 hours on my skin.",9,1728326025.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,2,0.85,False

New Years comes i tell her I Miss her and Hope she's OK. She tells me she misses me too and promises to Plan something. Then tells me she got into a Wreck and I offered to help fix it I did spent alot and had a quick date after. Then she worked on her days off till February (I can confirm), and I surprised her with Flowers Delivered and Food. She new it was me and after work I brought her so much stuff like a Teddy bear and just Valenties things. Maybe too much. Then coe is made. I promises that I would see her again and tell me that she's going through so much. I gave her space in april. Then 3 weeks later I Prayed to God, she would text me and she did right after lol she explained she was moving and got another Job, great. But still haven't seen her since. Then a Month ago I reached out and asked if she was OK and that I was praying for her. She thanked me sincerely and apologized for not giving me the time I deserved and just needed to work on herself for herself. No contact since. Today I wake up to her Snap showing she saw a Fight drinking beer with someone, a Guy just saw a Hand and was hurt. 

I didn't mention all the Signs I got this year I asked for if she'll Come back. 

I know everyone says don't look at 3D but just hurts seeing someone living your Dream or Happy without you. On Top of other issues in Life happening. 

I'd also like to add that I Had an Akashic Record done of us and it said we were best friends in the past Life in the Military and I took Care of them. Oddly enough i texted Mary before saying idk why but I just wanted to take care do you lol

1fyevqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/strange/comments/1fyevqm/i_posted_in_the_connecticut_sub_asking_if_anyone/,"I posted in the Connecticut sub asking if anyone had ever encountered ""ghosts"" of native americans. It was not received well, but I was told to post here. My story and question is as follows...","I wanted to share a question that's been on my mind since childhood, sparked by a vivid experience I can still picture clearly. I’m curious if anyone else has had something similar.

I was at my cousin's house in Berlin (Connecticut) just off chamberlain highway, not far from that massive brick mansion perched on the hillside ([link for non CT residents](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1510-Chamberlain-Hwy-Berlin-CT-06037/59047412_zpid/)). My cousin's (Aunt and Uncle's) place was an old school building from the early 1900s. One day, my uncle lifted the rug in the living room and pried up a piece of plywood, revealing a bunch of old school desks stored in the basement, all covered in dust. It was a fascinating place.

Growing up, I spent a lot of time there. My cousin and I were really close as kids, since we both got really into skateboarding before high school. One night, we were in the garage, just being kids throwing a ball around and skating on the quarter pipe my uncle built. The garage door was closed since it was getting late.

As I turned to pass him the ball or whatever I was doing, I noticed my cousin staring terrified over my shoulder, his eyes were wide open, and he was visibly confused. He yelled that we had to get upstairs for a better view of whatever it was he saw. Apparently, he had seen something glowing and translucent moving past the garage windows, heading toward the front yard. I never got a look at it from the garage but excitedly followed him upstairs wondering what was going on.

We rushed up to his bedroom, which had a view of the front yard, and that’s when we saw it. Sitting at the base of the crabapple tree was a Native American man in full traditional attire and a headdress. (I was questioned on the attire piece in the CT thread since it's not regionally appropriate for this area, but to the best of my recollection, that's what it looked like.) At ten years old, I had no clue what was happening, but we both saw it, exactly in the same spot. It was transparent and flashing vibrant colors, almost holographic. I can’t recall if it was moving, but it seemed to pulsate with a glowing electricity. That's the best I can explain it.

The tree was only about twenty feet away, and we were 100% transfixed on whatever it was we were looking at. I felt as if I were outside my own body; it was so surreal. My cousin panicked and ran to get my uncle. When he arrived, we pointed out the window, going, “Look look, what is that?!!” But my uncle just looked confused and said, “What?”

We were baffled. It was dark outside, and this thing was so intense and bright that anyone looking out the window would have instantly noticed it. I remember glancing at my cousin, not understanding why his dad couldn't see what we were witnessing. It felt so strange.

We then called my younger cousin to come up from the hallway, but by the time we got back to the window, it was gone. I was certain we hadn’t imagined it. It was a mystery I still can’t explain, even now at forty. Every few years, I’d bring it up to my cousin, ""remember that thing we saw?"" and he'd always be like ""yep that was fucking weird"". The last time I mentioned it was about twenty years ago, but I still remember it vividly. I'll have to ask him next time I see him now that it's on my mind again.

I kept this experience mostly to myself growing up, fearing people would think I was lying or crazy. It's not like I thought about it all the time. I guess when you're a kid, life is so new and unfolding that you quickly move on mentally from even the craziest happenings that you observe. But I remember remembering it pretty well throughout a lot of my childhood. 

Last year, during a Christmas gathering with my family, we started sharing bizarre stories while we sat around the coffee table at my folks place. I shared my experience, fully expecting my dad and sister to brush it off, which is exactly what they did lol. But then my mom surprised me by saying, “I had something like that happen too. I saw a Native American ghost or spirit when I was a kid when we lived in Old Saybrook. I can’t explain it.”

In that moment, I felt my eyes starting to well up, I felt both disbelief and relief. I'm very similar to my mother. We're both extremely empathetic people. We're open minded. We love harmony. We aren't jaded and cynical, but we're both rather free spirits and compassionate. It meant a lot to me that we both shared such an odd, yet powerful experience. It was so validating to know I wasn’t alone in this experience, or dreaming, or hallucinating. At least I don't think I was hallucinating because how do two people have the same hallucination? I absolutely know what I saw, and even at that young age, I recognized its reality.

I never quite knew what to do with this information, but I figured I’d share it here in hopes that someone else might relate. Occasionally, I drive through Berlin and take that bend by my cousin’s old house (they moved away long ago), and that same crabapple tree is still there, albeit much larger now.

They say children can perceive things that adults can’t, perhaps because they’re not yet conditioned by society or overwhelmed mentally with information and burden and stress or what have you. I’ll never know exactly what it was that we saw or why my uncle couldn’t see it. If I could go back in time and approach it, to get a closer look, I'd do it in a second.

I don’t typically subscribe to the paranormal as it’s framed today, or like ghosts we see in cartoons and movies, but something strange happened that night and it remains one of the most vivid and cemented memories in my brain. I sometimes explore UFO discussions but don’t consider myself a “believer” in the way some do. I tend to be a realist as I go about life. I'm a; the glass isn't half empty, the glass isn't half full, the glass just has water in it, kinda guy.

So, all my rambling aside, does anyone have a similar experience ~~from somewhere in CT~~?",3,1728325866.0,strange,2,0.71,False
1fyevae,https://www.reddit.com/r/strictlycomedancing/comments/1fyevae/week_three_lights_camera_action/,"Week Three: Lights, Camera, Action","https://preview.redd.it/wxnniui31ctd1.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf69e8a5aa20e95f0801d6fb5085e0c1efcd7f26

It’s Movie Week on Strictly and the first of ‘theme’ weeks. Here we can get to see what hair, make up and wardrobe are really about – and also who has peed them off and got the ~~crap~~ less well-refined outfits. HOTH and I went to see *Book of Mormon* this week which, safe to say, is highly unlikely to be turned into a film, never mind its songs being used in Movie Week on Strictly. The chances of it being used in Musicals Week are pretty slim, too. Shame. I can see someone like Carlos getting stuck into *“You and Me (But Mostly Me).”*

Saturday night saw Nick taking a bye as he’d injured himself *again* in training. He should have taken it last week to give him time to recover. So, *thirteen* couples brought us a variety of dances to a plethora of songs from a myriad of films. Some I’ve not even heard of, never mind seen. There’s always a few where you know the song, but didn’t know it was used in a film. When you google or IMDB it, you usually find it was seventh in the closing tracks or summat. Mind you, anything would be better than The Sound of Music, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Mary Poppins for the trillionth time. Maybe we’d be luckier this year. By the way – have you *read* Mary Poppins? Screenplay poetic licence doesn’t even begin to cover it. She was a gaslighting bully, pinching the kids’ legs to shut them up, not a rosy-cheeked lovely with a song in her heart for everyone. And that’s not me casting a 21^(st) Century stance on it – I’ve read the books. Check it out if you don’t believe me. Evil, she is!

First, there was a ~~quite painful to watch~~ skit about Dave Arch nicking the glitterball. Thankfully, I was mostly spared this as HOTH decided to faff with the sound settings on the telly, so all I saw were the menu screens. They should just drop these – they don’t add much or set the tone – the skits, I mean, not TV menu screens. I suspect most viewers spent the time getting the nibbles and drinks ready.

Thankfully, the pro dance was more of a treat, with an unrecognisable Kai dressed as Gru being tormented by the rest of the cast dressed as many manic minions. Somehow, Neil looked exactly the same, just yellow. It was a suitably silly start to the evening and got us in the mood for what was to come.

**Kai, aye.**

On tripped the judges, suitably attired – Craig looking quite dishy as Captain Jack Sparrow from *Pirates of the Caribbean*, Anton as the eponymous *Zoolander*, Motsi – apparently as Whitney Houston’s character from *The Bodyguard* \- looked more like the robot lady from Superman III if you ask me. And Shirley? Well, she flew in as Mary Sodding Poppins, didn’t she? I KNEW IT! Can’t go a bloody season without the bint. Poppins, that is, not Shirley. She kind of has to be there, what with her being Head Judge and all that. There was a bit of chatter with Tess and Claudia, and we were finally off.

**Motsi – Queen of The Nightmare**

First on our stage for the night were **Montell** and **Johannes** with a **Tango** to **One Night Only** from ***Dreamgirls***\*.\* Montell had admitted in her VT that she struggles to find her inner Diva and was advised ‘when in doubt, smile it out’. Did it work? As Tangos … er … go, this wasn’t a bad effort. Montell had a lot of drive, attack and intent and there was enough drama in the choreography for a dozen divas. She covered the floor well, her feet were good and she managed the changes of pace, direction and transitions between ballroom and Latin moves pretty well. There seemed to be a wobble towards the end, though, and her frame started to tighten up, her elbows dropping and her head placement went wonky. Fair feedback from the judges, and tips for softening her knees, **28 out of 40** scored.

**My Inner Diva Asking If HOTH Has Finished In The Bloody Bathroom Yet**

Up next were ***T*****oyah and Neil** with their **Samba** to **Poor Unfortunate Souls** from ***The Little Mermaid***. Oooft. That wouldn’t be Strictly Senior Management having a sly dig now, would it? And who are the Poor Unfortunate Souls – Toyah & Neil or us at home being forced to watch it? I can’t fault Toyah’s performance and characterisation as film baddie Ursula. The rest of the dance I can, though. Actually, that’s not fair. She had better timing this week, she tried hard with the steps and she seemed to have listened to Neil a bit about staying on the beat. The rest of it? Well. Despite spending a good third of the dance cavorting behind an octopus (that’s not a euphemism),Toyah went wrong more than once, she had no bounce, sway or rhythm and there was no isolation or rotation in her hips. A mermaid would have had better footwork, too. The panel weren’t impressed and her score plummeted to **15 out of 40**.

**Toyah Flounders At The Bottom Of The Sea-derboard**

Following this, a little ditty, ‘bout **Chris and Dianne** who went back up-tempo with a **Jive** to the ***Wayne’s World*** theme. The pair definitely got the Party On with this number. Hats off to Dianne, who is a fantastic teacher, but hats, gloves, scarves and coats off to Chris as a pupil. Wow. From the off, Chris’ jive action was good, his kick-ball-changes decent and his timing and sync with Dianne was truly excellent. He lost a little balance in the kicks and flicks on occasion, and his retraction could have been a tad sharper. He started to run out of steam towards the end which led to a couple of teeny errors but, overall, it was a good outing and fun to watch. The judges agreed (with Shirley praising Chris’ soft jive knees and toe-heel swivel) and **30 out of 40** was awarded.

**Are You Sure You Want Me To Drive, Dianne?**

Slowing things down were **Tasha and Aljaž** with their **Rumba** to a stripped back, acoustic **What Was I Made For?** from ***Barbie***. Urgh. Rumba. They could have done a Charleston to Barbie Girl by Aqua for flip’s sake! It seems couples are trying to get it out of the way as soon as possible this year. Actually, this wasn’t the most awful rumba I’ve seen on Strictly – Shirley reckons it was better than some of the people she’d just judged in the World Championships – especially as the pair had managed only four days’ training and there was no beat for Tasha to feel to assist her dancing. With Aljaz looking more like a *Mike Flowers Pops* tribute act than Ken, Tasha sashayed up a storm in this light, airy, romantic number. She had lovely, lyrical limbs with beautifully balanced spins and turns. Her extensions were exquisite and her core was strong and controlled. The transitions were a little jagged, spoiling the flow a bit but, overall, this was <grits teeth> pretty good. **34 out of 40** from the panel.

**Life’s A Beach For** **~~Ken~~** **Aljaž**

Still no ballroom routine for **Paul and Karen** who yet again drew the music-to-moves short straw, getting lumbered with a **Cha Cha** to the theme from ***The Magnificent Seven***. Yeah. That’s what I thought until the music started and they’d changed the iconic tune into a Cha Cha seemingly played on a Bontempi organ. Give the poor bloke a break and stop using him as this year’s comedy foil. You’ve got to admire Paul for trying – he could just flounce around with the barest nod to a routine and play it all for laughs. I mean, I still laughed, but there was an attempt at a Cha Cha in there. Somewhere. He had a go at some tricky steps and his footwork had improved. His cowboy character was good and he tried to master the technique. Hmm. What else positive? Ermm. His hat was nice? Sadly, the life-sized plastic horse props had better hip movement and Paul was somehow ahead and behind the beat *at the same time*, which takes some doing. Even with Karen frantically dancing around his, there was no distracting from the fact that this was a struggle for Paul. Even with some wild overmarking from ‘I liked it’ Tony Beak, just **19 out of 40** on the paddles.

**Paul Has A Mare With The Cha Cha**

Flying in from the wings were **Sarah and Vito** with a **Viennese Waltz** to **Hedwig’s Theme** from ***Harry Potter***. So, a slower, calmer more nuanced dance to the previous weeks was on the cards, dedicated to the incredible Dame Maggie Smith, who passed away this week. And Dame Maggie could not have asked for a better tribute. Sarah, who surely has to be a top contender for the Glitter Ball trophy was a wonderous whirlwind of waltz as she wound her way around the floor. Solid both in and out of hold she mastered event the trickiest of steps (a reverse turn into a reverse pivot if you’re interested) with confidence. There were huge, sweeping turns and spins and Sarah was as light on her feet as a Wingardium Leviosa’d feather. Not everything was perfect – she didn’t close / cross her feet on every occasion, there were patches of rise and fall and her head placement was dodgy – leading to lessons from Shirl’s Tiny Shoes and Anton’s Fellowship of the Frame. All good feedback for a spellbinding performance. Accio **33 out of 40**!

**Sarah In The Dance Off? You Cannot Be Sirius**

Enter Stage Left, **Pete and Jowita** with another **Samba**, this time to the ***George of the Jungle*** theme. Now, I’ve not seen this film. Reading the premise that might be a Good Thing. I can’t understand why Daniel Day Lewis wasn’t pleading with his agent to get him the role. I’m being mean – it might be a wonderful romp. So, as I gather, George of the Jungle is a handsome, muscly bloke who is utterly clueless out of his comfort zone. In this routine, he’s represented by Pete, a handsome, muscly bloke who … hang on a minute! I’m sensing a theme here. Okay, so the character might not be too far of a stretch for him, but I’m pleasantly surprised to say neither was this dance. If there was a weekly prize for Most Improved it would surely go to Mr Wicks. Dressed in a … fetching … leopard-print outfit, Pete began his routine on the Judges’ desk, gyrating his bottom in front of a giggling Craig. His many, many tattoos on show, Pete swung into Samba action, giving it proper. He definitely had some Samba hip action, his frame and leading were better and he gave us character with tongue very firmly in his cheek. It was a bit stop / start – work is still needed in his transitions – and he and the beat parted ways on occasion, but Jowita had put in some technical moves and steps. Alright, one nearly resulted in him tripping Jowita up, but this was a lot of fun to watch. Whether or not his posterior added to the points, the pair scored a whopping **26 out of 40**.

https://preview.redd.it/04zzloxp1ctd1.png?width=355&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2785eb7c47c365983bd93fe4aea5080d4d6cb16

**Wicks You Were Here?**

**JB and Amy** swooped after Pete with an **American Smooth** to **Pure Imagination** from ***Wonka***\*.\* JB and Amy had gone chocolate-making for their VT, which reminded me of a team building day I once went on. One of my colleagues asked if it we could dress down (eg wear our normal clothes) and the boss told him ‘Dress down, dress up, I don’t care’. So my colleague turned up in a Spider-Man muscle costume. Serve you right, Boss. Anyway – nary a superhero costume in sight for JB and Amy with this routine. Unlike some of the others, JB listens to the Judges’ feedback and showed more improvement this week. His frame was neater with no gapping, his bottom was nicely tucked under and his shoulders less hunched. He coped well with the lifts, easing Amy into and out of them fairly seamlessly and the pair told a nice, whimsical story. There’s still some bits to iron out – JB needs to take longer strides when leading Amy, there’s still some balance issues and, probably most important of all – he needs to remember to breathe! A routine may only be 90 seconds but that’s a long time when you’re strutting your stuff. The Oompa-Loompas, sorry, Panel were happy and gave **32 out of 40** – JB’s present of chocolate clearly working on Anton, who gave a nine.

**No Truffle Shuffle For JB**

**Sam and Nikita** powered through a **Paso Doble** to **Elevation** from ***Tomb Raider***. See what I mean about not knowing it was in a film? I dunno, maybe it was in a montage – it’s another one I’ve not seen. This was a quite decent little routine which saw Sam as Leggy Legend Lara Croft and Nikita as Nasty … Cold if he doesn’t put a jumper on and cover his chest! Sam abseiled into the dance with some very nice flamenco shaping in her arms. There was good connection with Nikita and you could tell he’d been working hard on her titeres. What? It’s a Paso step, you naughty people! Sam had lots of attack, drive and intent but her limbs were a bit loose which impacted the drama and purpose required for a Paso. Her legs were too straight in parts, but her lines were good overall and she tried hard to sell the character. Another celeb who’s showing improvement week on week, I don’t think she’s in danger of going home soon with a score of **30 out of 40.**

**Sam and Nikita – Jolie a Deux**

Also vying for **Viennese** Votes were **Shayne** **and** **Nancy** who danced to **If I Can Dream** from ***Elvis***\*\*.\*\* As if I needed to tell you that. Mind you, looking at Shayne’s outfit it would have been hard to tell. He was less The King and more Robbie Rotten from *Lazytown*. Guess we could tell who’d upset the wardrobe staff, then. It was a good dance, though. Shayne had his rise and fall under control and he managed to avoid skipping through the turns and spins, which some male celebs have struggled with. While a bit light on character for me, it was packed with content and the steps were far from basic. He closed his feet nicely, he led Nancy well and he was bang on the beat with his timing. Again, though, he had some framing issues, being a bit too far forwards at times, looming over his partner and that chin was jutting again. The Judges loved it, though, with Craig declaring it ‘Gawjus’ and Motsi saying Shayne was the best male dancer of the night so far. Then he fell upstairs! A generous 9 from Motsi gave the couple **33 out of 40**.

**No Tens For Shayne – He Was Robbied**

Where wardrobe had short-changed Shayne, **Wynne’s** outfit meant he could really *channel his inner* ***Mrs Doubtfir*****e** with his and **Katya’s Cha Cha** to **Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag**. Now, some ~~wazzocks~~ people have been rewatching that film with 21^(st) Century eyes and bapping on that it’s not *really* the wholesome story it was sold as. That Mrs Doubtfire was a controlling piece of work who Done Piers Brosnan Wrong. Look. Just stop, eh? It’s not Dostoyevsky. It doesn’t need navel gazing analysis. It’s not a documentary. It’s the late, extraordinarily talented (and much-missed) Robin Williams in one of his most iconic roles. Stop trying to make everyone and everything miserable! Sorry, got on me soapbox there for a minute. Anyway, Wynne fair made me forget all that negativity with his fun, cheering take on the character, hoovering up the love from the audience in the studio and at home with his larger than life performance. With excellent choreo from Katya this was a cracking dance that brought the house down. From flashing his bloomers to putting out boob fires, Wynne went for it. He had bags of energy from the get-go with fabulous rhythm and musicality, matching Katya in the side-by-side sections and even carrying of some difficult ‘question and answer’ moves. His feet were properly turned out, he finished his lines and he looked like he was having the time of his life. There were a few problems with his hips – they lacked some rotation and isolation – but, apparently, he had brilliant guapacha timing (pronounced summat like WhopperChaw). You have NO idea how many spelling attempts I had on Google trying to get that. My browsing history is going to be interesting for a while. Crowd pleasing and Judge pleasing, the pair got **30 out of 40**.

**Ain’t No Doubt Wynne Got Fire**

Movie Week also saw an early outing of a **Couple’s Choice** – which doesn’t usually make an appearance until at least mid-series. **Punam** **and** **Gorka** took their turn in the spotlight dancing to beloved Bollywood bhangra banger **Bole Chudiyan** from ***Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham***\*\*.\*\* In an absolute first for Strictly, and Gorka of course, we were treated to some great Indian dancing. Punam looked gorgeous in a Strictlyfied Indian dance costume, with her partner suitably attired in a sequinned sherwani. I loved this dance – so refreshingly different from the Street Dance, Fosse or Contempowaft styles we usually see. They could get rid of Couple’s Choice and replace it with Traditional Dance for me – imagine Neil getting to grips with Morris Dancing. Now, I’m not an expert on ~~anything~~ Indian dance, but this routine was a jaw-dropper. Punam danced with passion, full of joy and exhilaration as she coped magnificently with scarfography, smart switches of pace, beat and direction, difficult moves and shaping. The storytelling was on point and the whole thing brought a smile to my face. Shirley cooed it was ‘Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious’ and Motsi was moved to tears. A very good **33 out of 40** scored.

**Jamie and Michelle** finished the show with a quirky **Quickstep** to Elton John’s classic **I’m Still Standing** from ***Rocketman***. Or, if you’ve seen the Lockdown Video, I’b Dill Danding. Poor Elton sounded like a bloke down the pub doing karaoke with a bad sinus infection. Thankfully, Dave Arch’s singers fared better. Jamie, looking oddly like the love child of Timmy Mallett and Ethel Merman, cavorted around the dancefloor like a toddler on a cocktail of 90s Sunny D and Haribo. While he had pretty good rhythm, stamina and energy, it was all a bit frantic, frenetic, even messy. The side-by-side jive style sections were in sync but Jamie lost consistency, particularly getting in and out of hold where his frame went floppy, his lines loose and his shoulders shapeless. He definitely sold his character, playing up as Elton used to, but he’s done better dances, and he knew it. **30 out of 40** from Craig and chums.

**Jamie Gets A Rocket, Man**

Unfortunately, we didn’t get to see **Nick** **and Luba** facing the footlights with their **Charleston** to **Rain on the Roof** from ***Paddington 2,*** so we’ll never know if it was Paddington and The Rail Replacement Bus To Bermondsey or not. With the curtain closing and the popcorn being swept from the floor, the Box Office Leaderboard looked like this:

And so to the Sunday Results Show. HOTH and I had enjoyed a lovely hurkle durkle in bed. Oi, less of that! It’s actually a Scottish phrase meaning: to lie in bed or lounge about when one should be up and about. For us, it’s breakfast and coffees while watching TV shows about fixing vintage electronics or making toys. This is twenty years of marriage, people!

The show opened with Tess somewhat ominously standing in front of the gathered couples letting us know – as if we didn’t already – that the dance off was imminent. The poor sods then had to stand there while we went through the whole recap of the show and the Judges’ huddle. Oh, wait. That will have been added later. They were probably only standing there about twenty seconds. As you were.

Without any further preamble, we were into the first announcement of the evening. Blimey. That was a bit quick. But all was okay -  Tess Delay took her sweet time, as usual, ramping up the tension. Tension? There’s more tension in me knicker elastic. Annoying, is what it is. A billion millennia after she started, we finally found that the couple first in the dance off was …

**PAUL AND KAREN**

Smelling salts were unopened and my attack of the vapours remained unmanifested when this was announced. As much as Paul is fun to watch, he’s not exactly up there is he, bless him? With advice from Craig to try to add some more hip action and sell the routine, off they popped for a hot Vimto and a packet of Salt n Shake Crisps (disclaimer, I have no idea what they did, but this sounds like something I’d do, so there you go. I’m projecting. ‘Cos it’s Movie Week … no? I’ll get me coat).

Up in the Clauditorium we had a break-neck blether with the first bunch of saved souls. Apparently, Gorka has Punam on speed dial for his kids’ ailments, Sam thinks waiting for her name to be called is worse than waiting to see if she’s in the GB Hockey Squad, JB is bringing everyone apples and pears from his farm and Tasha makes Aljaž smile all day, every day. Which must be hell on his cheek muscles.

**Aljaž Grins And Bears It**

Oh, and poor Nikita can’t tell one Shakira song from another, belting out the wrong one for his announcement for next week’s number. I have never seen a bloke go so red!

In a change to usual proceedings THEN there was the pro dance, instead of right the top of the show where it usually is. Maybe they had a problem with the recording or something. They shouldn’t really have bothered, if you ask me. It was all a bit … meh … after all the others. Beige Neil channel surfing, unlucky in love, sees the lurved up others, catches Dianne, cut to Neil in pink suit. The end.

Another unnecessary bit with the Judges on the new semi-circle sofa then it was back to Business As Usual. Because we were unlikely to be able to handle any more excitement, things ~~ground to a halt~~ slowed down while Madame Molasses delivered the terrible truth that couple number two in danger was …

**TOYAH AND NEIL**

Well, colour me pink and call me Doreen. That was a shock. Me, sarcastic? Never! One did not need to be Septic Peg to see this one coming. It was probably about as inevitable as Monday following Sunday, or someone skriking about their ‘journey’ on X-Factor. Let’s just say I didn’t drop my knitting. Mainly because I wasn’t doing any, but you get the idea.

**Toyah Gets Taken Down A Peg Or Two**

Back with Cackling Claud, we learned Jamie does a terrible impression of Shirley while lying down with Michelle. Apparently NOT like that – and the poor lamb thought they would edit his gaffe out. Jamie, my love, it’s ‘live’! We also found out that Celebrity MasterChef winner Vito (is there no end to his perfection?) brings food in for everyone. I must say his parmigiana sounded more inviting than a nibble on JB’s Cox’s Pippins. Shayne takes notes of everything everyone says to him – I bet he doesn’t scribble *my* comments down – and his daughter is voting for Montell, who is putting JoJo through his paces. Do keep up!

The fantastic Professional Ivory Tickler Alexis Ffrench treated us to a beautiful rendition of *The Heart Asks Pleasure* from that fun-fest of a film, *The Piano*. I know I’m doing it a disservice but, my word, it was a downer. Unlike Alexis’ playing, which was simply divine. He’s also a judge on this year’s BBC Young Musician Of The Year, which is very much worth a watch. Previous winners include the magnificent Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who I’d listen to playing a Jive Bunny remix, if I’m honest.

What? Yes, yes. I AM procrastinating. I haven’t forgotten the Dance Off. I wish I could, but there you go.

Toyah and Neil were on the dance floor first. If anything, this outing was even worse. Toyah lolloped around like a stunned mullet, with Neil seeming to drag her round like a drunken auntie at a wedding. She seemed to forgo the steps in place of hamming up the character, mugging and gurning throughout the routine instead of concentrating on timing, balance, rhythm and, well, the whole flipping thing.

Paul and Karen, however, made an altogether better attempt at their dance. Paul seemed more relaxed, enjoying playing up to Karen and having fun with this character. There was more hip action and energy, better rhythm and, crucially, fewer mistakes.

You don’t really need me to tell you, do you? There was no split decision or Head Judge Casting Vote needed this week as the panel unanimously decided to send home

**TOYAH AND NEIL**

The pair should really have gone last week, in my opinion. Toyah may have been enjoying herself, but she wasn’t learning or improving. Poor Neil. Maybe one day the Strictly Gods will be kind and he’ll get a decent partner – unless they’re setting him up to be Anton 2 (Electric Boogaloo). Who knows?

And there we have it – another week over, another week closer to the Final. Fingers crossed Nick will have recovered enough to compete again. Although, and I know you’re all going to be bereft, there WON’T be a Strictly Blog from me next week. There, there, you’ll be *fine*! I’m having a very much deserved spa weekend with my lovely lady chums. The week after that, though? You better believe I’ll be here!

Until then, my little ballroom botherers …..

**KEEP DANCING!**

1fyetan,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_throwawaycdfjmm/comments/1fyetan/update_4_loooong/,Update #4 (Loooong!),"I know that not many people will probably read this, but in case anyone saw my original posts on r/povertyfinance (in fall 2023) I thought I'd give an update. This is more for my own benefit, since it helps to vent a little bit and write it all down, since I don't want to tell it to anyone I know IRL. I’d been waiting to write an update until I had one that was positive, and it’s been a while, but I finally have some semi-good news.

First of all, thank you again to everyone who wrote in advice on my first post. Just to recap, since it's been a while: I was in a long-distance relationship with my fiance (""Frank""), and had planned to move in with him after the wedding. The problem was, I had not yet found a full-time job in his area, and I wanted to wait before moving. But he wanted me to move in without a job. Adding complications was the fact that he lived with his mother on Section 8 Housing benefits, and when I tried to suggest that he stay with me until I got another job, he kept saying that he couldn't move because ""Housing won't allow it."" (I'll get more into this issue below.)

I just want to add a comment - without giving too many details, I'm neurodivergent. I'm not using that to \*excuse\* my poor decision-making (I understand that I have to take responsibility for my own bad choices and deal with the consequences) but more to \*explain\* my poor decision-making (since I'm sure a lot of people have read my posts and wondered why I'm such an idiot). I'm not 20 years old as one commenter smugly theorized. I'm not going to say my age, but let's say it's long enough to have several years of experience in my career, and old enough that I should know better than to get myself into situations like this. I also highly suspect that Frank is neurodivergent too, but in a different way. I'm just basing this on my own observations of him, and things that he has told me about his time in school. It's a very sore subject for him, and he is \*highly\* sensitive to anything that he takes as a comment about his intelligence. So it's not something I can really ask him about. (As an example, when he told me he really liked time-travel movies, like Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, and Back to the Future, I decided to show him my favorite episode of Doctor Who, ""Blink"" which uses time travel as a major plot device. He seemed annoyed while watching it, commented at the end that he didn't like it, and was in an extremely bad mood for the rest of the day. And I really feel like the reason he didn't like the episode was that he didn't understand it, and he was angry because he felt like I was looking down on him because of it.)

As I mentioned in the first follow-up post, I talked to Frank and told him that I wasn’t going to move until I found a full-time job. He originally agreed, then got his mom involved, who berated me on the phone, implying that I must not love him if I wasn’t ready to move in with him yet. I didn’t talk to him for a few days after that because I was so pissed off. He originally apologized for getting her involved, but then said that he didn’t want to have a “long-distance marriage” and that he’d rather break up than do that.

So after thinking it over, I decided to break up with him. I couldn’t sleep much that night, because I was thinking about our 3+ year relationship and feeling sad about it. I called him the next day and told him we needed to talk. He could sense that something was up, and asked me if I was breaking up with him, and he started to cry. And I caved. I agreed to move in with him, but said I needed one more month after the wedding, to tie things up at work, and save up some more money. (And also, I figured it would buy me some more time with job hunting, and some more time to collect a full-time salary.) I assumed that we were both on the same page, that me living with him and his mom on Section 8 was a temporary thing, just until I got a full-time job.

That’s why I haven’t updated. I could just “feel” the disappointment of all the Redditors who gave me advice/support on my first post, and encouraged me to not move without a job. And you’re all correct. Yes, it was a dumb decision, and yes, I was thinking with my heart (and genitals) more than my head. But I kept thinking, maybe somehow if I can get a decent job, we can get this to work out. And then I could post a positive update - not in the sense of ""I'll show all those meanies that I know better than them!"" But more in a sense of, ""I know I disappointed all those people who tried to help, and I hope that I can tell them that at least it did work out, just by pure luck.""

So I moved at the end of November. Frank got me a part-time job at the store where he works (and he actually did pull some strings for this, since they had already finished hiring their seasonal/Christmas employees). In the meantime, I kept applying/interviewing for full-time jobs in my field. Frank’s mom had me added to the rental agreement for their house, and also listed on their Section 8 Housing agreement.

My money situation got really bad. I was putting all my expenses on a credit card (car insurance, food/care for my pets, and a storage unit for my stuff since there wasn’t enough room at Frank's house), and making minimum payments each month with my part-time salary. (I also had to contribute to the rent since my additional earnings made their amount go up.) I was regularly having panic attacks, and losing weight from not having an appetite. Finally, in January I got a full-time job in my field, but with a not-very-good salary ($50k instead of my previous job which was $59k, and now I was in a higher-cost-of-living area. And also no longer getting alimony from my ex-husband).

But I was happy to at least be earning more money. Until Frank’s mom found out. She was really upset, calling it a “slap in the face” that I would get a full-time job and cost her all of her benefits. I felt like I was taking crazy pills, as I looked back and forth between her and Frank, and I could have sworn that I had been clear since the start of our engagement (over a year earlier) that I was looking for a full-time job. I know I had brought it up several times, keeping them updated on the progress of the job hunt, letting them know every time I had an interview (and was eventually rejected) etc.

She claimed to be completely unaware. I said that I needed this job to pay my expenses. And she replied, “Well, how much are your monthly expenses?” And I could tell from her tone of voice, that she was planning to argue about how much money I needed to get by, and try to pressure me into just making ends meet with my part-time job. I angrily said, “A LOT” and didn’t elaborate more. I suggested that now that I was making more money, why don’t we just get off of Section 8, and I’d pay the additional cost for the rent. She said that she has other benefits too, including a low-income health insurance. She said that if I or Frank earned too much money, she’d lose the insurance.

I said, “Okay then, why can’t Frank and I move out, and get our own place? Then you can stay on Section 8 and keep your health insurance, and our salaries won’t impact it.” This is a solution I had previously brought up during all our arguments prior to moving (and several people mentioned this in reply to my original post). Frank and his mom had always dismissed that solution, saying “Housing won’t allow it,” and I could never get a clear explanation on what they meant by that, since the Housing agreement was in her name.

So when I brought up the solution again, of Frank and I moving out, they both again started up with the “Housing won’t allow it” retort. This time I insisted on more of an explanation, since I know that it’s indeed possible to get off of Housing, and it’s not like you can be legally forced to remain on it for life. Frank said, “My name is on the lease.” I replied with exasperation, “Then get your name removed from the lease!!!”

And then the truth came out. Frank’s mom said, “If he moves out, my housing benefit would change. I’d only be entitled to a rental with one bedroom instead of two.”

Now imagine the ""dolly zoom"" scene from Jaws, where Roy Scheider was in complete shock as he watched the kid get eaten by the shark. That's what happened here. I was seeing red. I was so angry, and tempted to reply, “How many bedrooms do you need?” So this was the reason for this whole setup. If Frank moved out, then his mom would have to move some place slightly smaller. And apparently to her, this was worth keeping her adult child living with her forever, working a low-paying, part-time job, to avoid making “too much” money. I was livid. Isn’t a parent supposed to want what’s best for their child? Did she think this was best for him? All because, I don’t know, I guess it would be a minor inconvenience to have to move? I was mad at Frank too, but moreso at his mom, because she was the “mastermind” behind this whole setup. Frank has lived his whole life with his mom, and he’s just used to her running the household and making all the decisions. He has gone along with this setup since he was a young teenager, because it’s all he knows, and because his mom told him that this is the way it has to be. (Yes, I know that I’m making excuses for him, and that part of the problem is his inability to stand up to his mom and make his own decisions. His mom seems to have him convinced that the minor inconvenience of her moving into a smaller place would literally be the end of the world, so he has to live with her for the rest of his life, working part-time to avoid making too much money. That's another can of worms.)

Thinking back to previous conversations during our engagement, something doesn't add up. Not just the fact that his mom claimed that she had \*no idea\* I was looking for a full-time job. But I know that at a few different times while we were still long-distance, I had mentioned to both of them, that once I got a full-time job, Frank and I could move out and get our own place, so we didn't affect her benefits. Or, that we could all get off Section 8 entirely, with our combined earnings. Neither one of them ever said that would be a problem. I even remember his mom saying something along the lines of how she ""wouldn't be opposed to moving"" depending on what happened with our finances. Looking back, I really feel like she intentionally gaslit me - making me believe that getting a full-time job was okay, just to get me to move out there. And then assuming that once I was living with them, on Section 8 and only a part-time salary, that I'd be basically ""trapped"" and she could coerce me into remaining in poverty for the rest of my life.

(I did finally, months later, mention these suspicions to Frank , and he basically confirmed them. He agreed that his mother must have known I was looking for a full-time job that whole time, because he had discussed it with her previously, and remembered me discussing it with her.)

So at that point in the conversation, I angrily stated that I was going to move back to my hometown and beg for my old job back, because I was not going to work part-time forever, just to save her from the inconvenience of moving to a slightly-smaller place. I grabbed my dog and stayed at a hotel for the night (yay, more credit card bills). And I turned off my phone.

I woke up the next morning to a text from Frank , saying that he and his mom had a “solution” where I wouldn’t have to quit my new job. So I grudgingly went back to their house to talk about things. The “solution” was that I would rent a cheap apartment which would legally be my address, but then just continue to stay with them. (So those of you who suggested they would try to pull something like this, you were right.)

I didn’t like that solution for moral/legal reasons, and I said that if I was going to have an apartment, then I wanted it to truly be my home. Meaning I would keep all of my stuff there, and spend time there, and that Frank and I could alternate sleeping over at each other’s place. I wasn’t just going to live 100% of my time at their house, because I didn't like being part of a scam, and also I was sick of not having enough room for my own stuff.

However, I hit a snag. As I mentioned, this is a higher cost of living area than my old hometown. The absolute cheapest apartment I could find, was about half of the monthly take-home salary at my new job. I went to check it out, and the salesperson showed me around. But when they saw my salary, they said they couldn't rent to me. So I guess you could say I hit the ""benefits cliff.""

I ended up finding something cheaper – by renting a single bedroom in a house shared with 3 other people, and a common kitchen/bathroom. And no wifi, no pets allowed. It was about a 10-12 minute drive from Frank’s house. And it wasn't big enough to keep all my stuff from the storage unit, so I had to keep paying for that too. I did end up staying over there occasionally, whenever Frank and I had a fight (the fights weren't always about finances, so I won't get into the details here).

This went on for several months. I was blowing a not insignificant part of my meager salary on a crappy “apartment” that I didn’t even enjoy being at. It was difficult trying to chip away at my credit card debt that I’d racked up during the move and the 2 months where I was only working part time. I constantly worried about my car, which is pretty old. If it broke down, I didn’t have enough money for extensive repairs or a new car, and then I’d have no way to get to work. Plus, I didn't really like my new full-time job, specifically a lot of the policies and the way that employees are treated. Maybe if the pay was better, I could have lived with the other issues, but working at a crappy job that also had crappy pay was wearing me down.

My relationship with Frank's mom also soured. Mainly because I can't get over the fact that she's so selfish that she has Frank convinced that he can never move out or get a well-paying job because it would affect her. I don't have kids, but I know that if my kid had an opportunity for a better life, but it would require me to move to a different place, I would do it. I talked about this with Frank, and while I didn't specifically use the word ""selfish"" I did tell him I think it's terrible. And he agreed, saying that he hates his job, and hates the fact that he can't get anything better because of her. But the way he talks about the situation, it's like it's some abstract thing. He talks about ""the roadblock"" that stops him from getting a better job, but I can't get him to see that the ""roadblock"" is his mom's selfishness and his inability to defy her. He's just been so dependent on her for his whole life that he can't bring himself to move out because she won't ""let"" him. I keep trying to tell him that he's a grown man who doesn't have to do everything his mom says, but it's like talking to a brick wall. So, she and I generally get along okay and I force myself to be polite to her, but I'm never going to ""like"" her again.

Most of my possessions were still boxed up in my storage unit. When I first moved into Frank's house, I didn't mind keeping my stuff in storage because I assumed it would only be temporary. Once I found out that he had no intention of ever moving out, and that in his mind, this was a ""permanent"" situation, I was upset that he never once offered to make any room for my stuff in his bedroom, other than the bare minimum (a small vanity table for getting ready in the morning, and food/supplies for my pets). So I never really felt like his place was my ""home"" because it was basically all of his stuff and none of mine.

I was very depressed. I was drinking a lot, not eating much, and feeling very hopeless. Many times I thought about how much better off I would be (financially) if I had indeed broken up with Frank that day, or even better, if I had never met him to begin with. I stayed in touch with some former co-workers who promised to keep me posted if my old job becomes available (they are in a hiring freeze due to budget cuts, so probably not any time soon). Many times I was tempted to just get an annulment, and move back home and look for a job there. (But maybe there was a bit of a ""sunk cost fallacy"" going on.) Frank could tell how unhappy I was, and whenever he asked about it, I didn't want to start another argument about our living situation, so I would just say I was stressed about money. He tried to be supportive, but that usually involved saying things like, ""I'm sure it will all work out"" or ""I've been poor my whole life and things have been fine.""

I eventually got a second job in my field, working part-time in the evenings a few days a week. Frank wasn't happy about us spending less time together (I think if he ever took one of those ""5 love languages"" quizzes, his love language would be ""quality time together""). But he knew better than to argue with me about it, because I really needed the money. And it did help me to make a slight dent in paying off my credit card bills. Interestingly, this part-time job paid a higher hourly rate than my full-time job, which tells you how bad the pay was there.

During this time I continued to apply/interview for better-paying jobs in my field (which I won't say because I don't want anyone to be able to figure out my main reddit profile, where I had been posting job-related questions). Then an amazing thing happened. After a particular interview, the manager called me to offer me the job. From what I heard later on, I wasn't the best candidate ""on paper"" but they decided to hire me based on the presentation I had to give as part of the interview, to describe the planning/execution of a previous project I had worked on.

The low end of the advertised salary range was $65k, and I was happy with that. But even better, they offered me more. Since I had a few years of prior experience in a particular job duty, they were offering me the middle of the salary range: $73k. This would put me a little above where I was before, when I was making $59k and getting alimony.

While all the red-tape with the new job was going on, I started making plans to rent a real apartment - the one I had looked at several months prior but was unable to afford with my low salary. And I told Frank that when I got it, I was going to spend more time over there. I would go to my apartment every morning to get ready for work. (Mainly because I don't have a lot of room for my clothes and hair/skin stuff, and I'm sick of sharing a single bathroom/shower with him and his mother.) And I was going to put up some shelves or a dresser and finally get all my stuff out of the boxes and have a place to put it. And since this place was only a short drive from Frank's house, it would be easy to go back and forth.

At that moment, a light bulb apparently went off in Frank's head about one of the reasons for my unhappiness, and a realization that we were about to spend even less quality time together. Because suddenly, without prompting from me, he said that he's going to put a lot of his own stuff in boxes, and make room on his shelves/tables for some of my stuff. And he kept going on and on about how he wants his room to feel like my room too, and he wants us both to have an equal say in how it's decorated. I think it's interesting that, when he saw that I would finally have another place to hang out, he was suddenly very eager to appease me and try to make me happy at his place. Because when I first moved in, I felt like I had to beg and plead just for a tiny corner for my vanity and a little space for pet food. (There was lots of sighing/grumbling on his part about having to move things around to make room for my little vanity.)

I started the new job over the summer, and have had the new apartment for about 2 months. I did hit another snag in that this is apartment is tiny. It's a studio apartment, and the whole thing is not much bigger than Frank's bedroom. Somehow, when I viewed a similar apartment in person several months ago, I didn't remember it being so incredibly small. Before we got married, I was living in a 2-bedroom apartment, and now I'm paying $100 more for a place that's about half as big. So I'm still in the process of getting my stuff out of storage, and I suspect that it's not all going to fit. So I've been depressed about that. I know, it's a first-world problem: oh boo-hoo, I have so much stuff that I can't find a place to hold it all. I guess it's not the end of the world, but it does make me sad that I have all sorts of things that I've been collecting, that I might not be able to see for a long time - my books, DVDs, stuffed animals, various collectibles and memorabilia. But I've signed a one-year lease so I'll be here for at least that long. At least my dog can come with me when I stay here.

And do be honest, I do kind of like having ""my own"" place. I'm a major introvert, and when I left my first husband, it was the first time I was living alone, and I really enjoyed it. So now, I mostly sleep over at Frank's house, and then in the morning I get up and go to my own place. First I have a cup of coffee while I sit in bed and look at my phone, and just enjoy the solitude. Then after I feel more awake, I get dressed and do hair/makeup. Then after I get out of work, I go to my place, take a shower, and then go to his place.

Interestingly, I've noticed that Frank likes hanging out at my place too. When we were first dating, I remember that he seemed in awe of me, because of how I, in his words ""have my life together"" because I had a full-time job, a car, and an apartment. On the weekends we usually like to cook dinner together and watch movies, which we used to do at his place. Then he suggested trading off, where one weekend we'd be at his place, and the other weekend we'd be at my place. And now it's morphed into us just spending every weekend at my place. He clearly enjoys being away from his mother's nagging, and I feel like it's sort of ""exciting"" for him, like spending the night at a hotel or something.

For the time being, I'm still working at the part-time job, just until I get my credit card paid off and get a chance to put away some more money in savings.

So that's where things are now. Whatever happens with me and Frank, at least now I feel like I'm in a good financial place - and by keeping the part-time job, I'm actually be in a better financial place than before I moved from my hometown. And now that I can have more of my stuff at my own apartment, at least I'm no longer dependent on Frank' mom allowing me to be at their place - so if I need to, I can stay at my own place indefinitely. And that is an important factor to me - because based on the way she treats Frank, I've gathered that she likes to be ""in charge"" of everything and boss people around. And now that I'm not reliant on her for a place to live, I feel like a weight is off my shoulders. Maybe Frank is okay with letting her run his life, but I'm not going to let her run mine.

So again, I want to thank everyone who offered advice to my original post. I'm happy to say that things are somewhat working out, mainly due to pure luck. You guys were all correct to advise me not to move without a full-time job, and I didn't listen to you. But at least by chance, things have somewhat worked out.

P.S.: I wanted to add this, because I figure someone will ask: There are no kids in this situation, and there never will be. Neither of us want kids, and after Roe got overturned last year, I got my tubes removed. I also wanted to add, in case anyone is thinking this, Frank is not with me because of my money. For one thing, he didn't know what I did for a living or how much money I made when we first met. Also, he has never asked me for money. I do give his mom a little money to contribute toward household expenses because I'm at the house a lot. But he has never asked me for money and is reluctant to accept gifts/help from me. One week he had fewer hours at his job due to circumstances beyond his control. I tried to give him some cash and he actually backed away from me, saying he didn't want it and would manage on his own.",1,1728325702.0,u_throwawaycdfjmm,0,1.0,False

I say just about zero because my biggest addictions are sugar and coffee. Five months ago, I was able to exchange coffee for chai tea and I haven’t gone back to coffee. Never would I have ever thought I could do this so I’m proud of myself. For sugar, it’s either taking it completely away (which has worked in the past but didn’t stick) or trying to just eat one piece of candy or whatever a day. I have always failed at one a day method. Cutting it out, I have been able to do for months. For sugar, I’m not able to eat just one cookie, I have to eat the whole box. I’m addicted to energy drinks and crave them constantly. I can’t have sugary food in the house because I will eat them all. I also have this weird number thing where if I eat one of anything, I need to eat three because three is a better number; OCD? I need help.

Not that it matters but I grew up in a normal family without eating issues. My entire family never had issues with overeating. I was always skinny and didn’t eat much so I was thin. As an adult, I’m still on the upper end of what BMI thinks is a healthy /normal weight. I don’t weigh myself so I don’t know what I weight other than when I go to the doctor so that’s how I know I’m still within the normal weight scale but on the upper end. I could stand to lose weight not to be skinny, but to feel better in my body. I don’t like feeling like I can’t live without something. I am an athlete and I have maintained a healthy weight because I run a lot. But it’s obviously putting a bandaid on a massive issue. When I fall out of my running schedule because of depression, I obviously gain weight.

I think it starts with someone mistaking either Y/N or her friend for a target and attacking them and that's how they meet Levi.

The second one is also Levi x reader and I'm pretty sure it was a modern au where they were both gamers and knew each other irl and online but didn't know that the person they knew irl and online was the same person. Pretty much the only detail I remember about that one is that Levi had 'heichou' in his username.

Friday:
Drove up from CT:
- stop at Allan’s falafel for lunch… best I’ve ever had. Service was fantastic. 
- stop at stone ridge orchard. Quiet, quaint. Big tree was stunning. Apples are delicious! 
- check into this cabin. GREAT place for couples that don’t mind being a bit remote. Lux glamping vibe. Very romantic. 

https://www.airbnb.com/slink/hLbobMVQ

- headed to Lola’s in Kingston for dinner. Luckily had a reservation because it was super busy. Pizza was great, vibe was nice. 

Saturday:
- lazy morning enjoying the cabin property. Went on a hike, made coffee, ate breakfast, used the sauna. 
- went into Hudson for 1:30. Had massages booked at Bodhi which is our favorite. 
- went to back bar but wouldn’t go back. We’ve been several times in past trips, but everything was off - food was very meh for the price, service was fine but it literally feels like a cafeteria, place was pretty dirty.. trash outside.. bathrooms looked and smelled like they hadn’t been cleaned in a long time. Overall just left a lot to be desired and wasn’t what I remembered. Some lady changed her babies diaper in full view of other diners sitting outside. Deff better places to check out. 
- went to Suarez family brewery. New taproom is stunning. Beer is always incredible. 
- headed back to Airbnb to chill for the night, enjoy a fire and relax.

Sunday:
- hit the Catskill farmers market which was awesome. Best egg sandwich I’ve had in a long time from eggman 
- drove the route from Catskill to Burlington, CT which was a STUNNING fall drive. Very remote and relaxing passing through farm lands. Stopped at hogans cidery (it was fine, very crowded but cute fall activity I guess) and Tonn’s Market because we love the smetana food truck.

I (34F) got a minor concussion from playing sports last year, with symptoms lasting about a week. These symptoms were mostly sensitivity to noise, fatigue, minor dizziness, and headache. But there was also another ""symptom"" that I actually loved. For that week that I had the other concussion symptoms, my usual racing thoughts were gone. I felt so calm and happy. I actually didn't even know what it was like not to have the racing thoughts when I wake up. As far as I know, I've had these my whole life. I wake up and my mind starts churning with so many thoughts. They are pretty random, unfocused and there are too many of them and make me feel anxious. This is my normal state. It was sooooo nice not to have them during the concussion.  After about a week of having the concussion, I woke up one morning and the racing thoughts were back. I knew my mind was healing but it sucked having them again after enjoying a week without them. So I told my friend about this and she said it is NOT normal. I brushed it off because I've been like this my whole life. Lately the racing thoughts have been worse and I have been thinking about it again.

1fyei7c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fyei7c,I made Sachertorte,"Yumm! This cake was a hit!

There are a few things I learned along the way.

1. You need a cake... cardboard. I'm not sure what it's called but those round cake cardboards that are the exact size of your cakepan or a little bigger, that I usually skip because pfft, it can go right on the cake safe, right? No. Not with this cake. You get your two cakes, put them together, grab a wire rack if you have one (I lucked out and realized someone left an air fryer here years ago and it had a wire rack that worked okay), and then you'll coat it with liquid chocolate. Then you have to transfer hours of work from the wire mesh to the cake safe without damaging it. I don't know how Max did this step, he must be a magician. But I cut a paper plate to go under the cake but on top of the mesh. So after the glaze was done I could take two spatulas under the cake to carefully lift it to it's home. Maybe the cake was dense enough to hold its own while being lifted that way but I didn't want to risk it so had the paper plate to disperse the load a little.

2. If you want a nicer finish on top, I have two thoughts. First, don't put the jam as thick as I did, keep it thin. You can see in the picture where I first started pouring and it melted the jam and made a little rivulet. Second, perhaps waiting for the chocolate mix to cool a little before beginning would help the mixture go on a little thicker.

3. The sides. No matter how I poured I could not get the glaze to do more than give me little lines of chocolate on the sides. So, by happy mistake I poured in a (cleaned) sink on a wire rack that rested on a cake pan that was 1inch bigger than the sachertorte. So, when I poured, all that chocolate got caught in my clean cake pan and I was able to scoop it up with a spatula to smear it thoroughly on the sides. It got a little easier to work with as it cooled, I think. Tip number three, have a pan underneath when you pour the chocolate, so you can reuse it if needed.

Other considerations: 
I used two 8 in cake pans instead of the 9in springform because I don't have a 10in knife... and cutting a cake in half in a spiral did not sound like a fun time. Ha. Surprisingly because the cake is fluffed with the egg whites it didn't really rise much which means it didn't really make a hill that needed cut. I just left both cakes as is. You can see that it left the sides with a bit of a dip, but structurally it's fine.

The glaze on top never dried because of the jam, but the sides were porous so the glaze seeped in and hardened into a thin layer of stiffened chocolatey goodness that had such an amazing flavor. Next time I might save the jam for between the layers, cut off the ""hill"" on top to make it porous and see if I can get that stiffened glaze effect all around.

A few people in the YT comments mentioned their grannies would substitute coffee for the water in the glaze. I'm definitely going to try that next time too, but wanted to try the recipe as is first. 

I made this for my mom's birthday and as she was eating it she couldn't stop looking surpirsed and saying, ""wow, this is really good!""
[The german chocolate cake from scratch was for my husband with the same birthday]

Hope this convoluted anecdote might help other adventurous bakers! Thanks Max Miller for sharing this recipe!

**What is Java Burn?**  
Java Burn is a powdered supplement designed to be mixed into your coffee. Unlike traditional weight loss pills or shakes, Java Burn is unique because it dissolves seamlessly in your morning coffee without adding any taste. According to the manufacturers, Java Burn is formulated to enhance the fat-burning process by boosting your metabolism and improving your body’s ability to burn calories more efficiently. The supplement contains natural ingredients known to help in weight loss, all without any harmful stimulants or additives.

**Ingredients of Java Burn**  
One of the key factors that people consider before using any supplement is its ingredients. What are the ingredients in Java Burn that make it effective? The product is made up of several natural compounds that are known to aid weight loss:

* **Green Tea Extract:** Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract can boost metabolism and increase fat burning.
* **Chlorogenic Acid:** This compound, found in coffee, reduces the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system, helping to prevent fat buildup.
* **L-Theanine:** An amino acid that works to improve focus and reduce anxiety, making it an excellent complement to the caffeine in coffee.
* **Chromium:** This mineral regulates blood sugar levels, helping to curb appetite and reduce cravings.

These ingredients work synergistically to deliver the promised benefits of increased fat burning and improved metabolism. Users have reported significant results, praising the supplement for helping them lose weight without the jitters or crashes often associated with caffeine-heavy products.

**Does Java Burn Work?**  
The biggest question that potential users have is, Does Java Burn work? Based on real reviews, Java Burn appears to be highly effective for many people. Users report noticeable weight loss within a few weeks of starting the supplement, especially when combined with regular coffee consumption and a balanced diet. The fact that it blends seamlessly with coffee without altering the taste makes it convenient to use daily.

[**Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://shorturl.at/Bdz1W)

One of the advantages Java Burn has over other weight loss supplements is that it doesn’t require users to make significant lifestyle changes. Simply add it to your coffee, and it starts working to enhance metabolism. According to Java Burn reviews, many users have experienced improved energy levels and steady weight loss without feeling deprived.

**Is Java Burn Safe?**  
Another common concern is, Is Java Burn safe? Since Java Burn contains natural ingredients like green tea extract and L-theanine, it is considered generally safe for most people. However, like with any supplement, it’s important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting it, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or are taking medication. Java Burn doesn’t contain artificial additives or harmful chemicals, making it a safer option compared to many other weight loss supplements.

**Java Burn Complaints and Side Effects**  
Although Java Burn has overwhelmingly positive feedback, some users have raised concerns about side effects. Java Burn complaints mainly revolve around digestive discomfort or mild jitteriness, which could be linked to caffeine sensitivity. These side effects are rare, and most users report no issues when taking the recommended dosage.

It’s worth noting that Java Burn isn’t a miracle cure. Some users have expressed disappointment in Java Burn reviews for not achieving their desired weight loss goals, but this may be due to unrealistic expectations or not using the product consistently. Weight loss is a gradual process, and supplements like Java Burn work best when used as part of a balanced diet and exercise routine.

**Java Burn on Amazon and Walmart**  
One of the most frequent questions people ask is where to buy Java Burn. Java Burn on Amazon is a popular option, as Amazon is a trusted platform with fast shipping. Amazon Java Burn reviews are generally positive, with users praising the product for its convenience and effectiveness. However, be cautious about purchasing Java Burn from third-party sellers, as there have been reports of counterfeit products. For this reason, it’s recommended to purchase directly from the official website or a reputable retailer.

Java Burn at Walmart is another option, although availability may vary depending on your location. As with any supplement, make sure to verify that you’re purchasing the authentic product, especially when buying from large retail chains.

**Java Burn Results**  
The Java Burn results reported by users vary, but the overall feedback is overwhelmingly positive. Some users have reported losing between 5-15 pounds within the first month, while others have experienced more gradual weight loss. The key to success seems to be consistency: users who take Java Burn daily and incorporate it into their coffee report better results than those who use it sporadically.

In addition to weight loss, many users have noted increased energy levels and improved mental clarity. This can be attributed to the combination of green tea extract and L-theanine, which work together to enhance focus without causing a crash later in the day.

**Java Burn Reviews: Amazon vs. Consumer Reports**  
When comparing Java Burn reviews on Amazon to Java Burn reviews on Consumer Reports, the consensus is similar. Both platforms feature positive feedback, with users praising the product for its convenience and effectiveness. However, some Java Burn Amazon reviews complaints center around issues with shipping or receiving counterfeit products. For this reason, it’s essential to purchase from reputable sellers.

By the end, you'll have a well-rounded perspective on this intriguing supplement and be able to make an informed decision that aligns with your health and fitness objectives.

 **What is Java Burn?**

Java Burn is a powdered weight loss supplement that is designed to be mixed into your morning coffee. This unique formula was created by a company called Java Burn, and it claims to leverage the power of natural ingredients to boost metabolism, increase fat burning, and support overall weight management. The Java Burn supplement is said to be gluten-free, non-GMO, and free of stimulants, making it a potentially appealing option for those seeking a natural approach to weight loss.

 The Java Burn formula is composed of a proprietary blend of minerals, vitamins, and plant-based extracts that are believed to work synergistically to enhance the metabolism and promote fat-burning. Some of the key ingredients in the Java Burn supplement include green tea extract, L-carnitine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid from green coffee beans. These components are purported to help optimize the body's natural processes and support healthy weight management.

 One of the unique aspects of Java Burn is that it is designed to be added directly to your morning coffee. The manufacturer claims that this method of administration allows the ingredients to be absorbed more efficiently, leading to more noticeable weight loss results compared to taking a standalone supplement. The powder is said to dissolve seamlessly in the coffee, without affecting the taste or aroma.

 Overall, Java Burn appears to be a promising weight loss supplement that aims to leverage the power of natural ingredients to help individuals achieve their health and fitness goals. As with any supplement, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating it into your routine, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.

 **Java Burn Reviews: Real User Experiences**

When it comes to evaluating Java Burn, it's crucial to examine real user experiences and reviews. I've delved into numerous customer testimonials to gain a well-rounded understanding of this weight loss supplement. While some Java Burn users report positive results, such as increased energy, reduced appetite, and steady weight loss, others have not seen the same level of success.

 It's important to note that individual results may vary, and factors like diet, exercise, and overall health can all impact the effectiveness of Java Burn. One customer, who requested to remain anonymous, shared their experience: ""I've been using Java Burn for a few months now, and I've noticed a slight increase in my energy levels and a small decrease in my appetite. However, the weight loss results have been modest at best."" On the other hand, another user, Sarah, raved about her experience: ""Java Burn has been a game-changer for me. I've lost over 15 pounds in the last two months, and I have more energy throughout the day. I'm thrilled with the results.""

 Ultimately, the real java burn reviews suggest that while Java Burn may work well for some individuals, it may not be a one-size-fits-all solution. Potential users should carefully consider their own health, lifestyle, and expectations before deciding whether to incorporate Java Burn into their weight loss regimen.

 **How Does Java Burn Work for Weight Loss?**

The secret behind Java Burn's weight loss abilities lies in its unique blend of natural ingredients. This formula is designed to target various aspects of metabolism, such as increasing thermogenesis, enhancing fat oxidation, and supporting healthy blood sugar levels. By addressing these fundamental factors, Java Burn aims to create a favorable environment for weight loss and overall health improvements.

 One of the key mechanisms of Java Burn is its ability to boost metabolism. The blend of ingredients, including green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chromium, work together to stimulate the body's natural fat-burning processes. This not only helps to increase calorie burn but also supports the body's ability to break down and utilize stored fat more efficiently.

 Additionally, Java Burn is formulated to enhance fat oxidation, which means it helps the body to literally ""burn"" fat for energy. This is achieved through the inclusion of ingredients like Garcinia Cambogia and green coffee bean extract, which have been shown to support healthy fat metabolism.

By the end, you'll have a well-rounded perspective on this intriguing supplement and be able to make an informed decision that aligns with your health and fitness objectives.

 **What is Java Burn?**

Java Burn is a powdered weight loss supplement that is designed to be mixed into your morning coffee. This unique formula was created by a company called Java Burn, and it claims to leverage the power of natural ingredients to boost metabolism, increase fat burning, and support overall weight management. The Java Burn supplement is said to be gluten-free, non-GMO, and free of stimulants, making it a potentially appealing option for those seeking a natural approach to weight loss.

 The Java Burn formula is composed of a proprietary blend of minerals, vitamins, and plant-based extracts that are believed to work synergistically to enhance the metabolism and promote fat-burning. Some of the key ingredients in the Java Burn supplement include green tea extract, L-carnitine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid from green coffee beans. These components are purported to help optimize the body's natural processes and support healthy weight management.

 One of the unique aspects of Java Burn is that it is designed to be added directly to your morning coffee. The manufacturer claims that this method of administration allows the ingredients to be absorbed more efficiently, leading to more noticeable weight loss results compared to taking a standalone supplement. The powder is said to dissolve seamlessly in the coffee, without affecting the taste or aroma.

 Overall, Java Burn appears to be a promising weight loss supplement that aims to leverage the power of natural ingredients to help individuals achieve their health and fitness goals. As with any supplement, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating it into your routine, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.

 **Java Burn Reviews: Real User Experiences**

When it comes to evaluating Java Burn, it's crucial to examine real user experiences and reviews. I've delved into numerous customer testimonials to gain a well-rounded understanding of this weight loss supplement. While some Java Burn users report positive results, such as increased energy, reduced appetite, and steady weight loss, others have not seen the same level of success.

 It's important to note that individual results may vary, and factors like diet, exercise, and overall health can all impact the effectiveness of Java Burn. One customer, who requested to remain anonymous, shared their experience: ""I've been using Java Burn for a few months now, and I've noticed a slight increase in my energy levels and a small decrease in my appetite. However, the weight loss results have been modest at best."" On the other hand, another user, Sarah, raved about her experience: ""Java Burn has been a game-changer for me. I've lost over 15 pounds in the last two months, and I have more energy throughout the day. I'm thrilled with the results.""

 Ultimately, the real java burn reviews suggest that while Java Burn may work well for some individuals, it may not be a one-size-fits-all solution. Potential users should carefully consider their own health, lifestyle, and expectations before deciding whether to incorporate Java Burn into their weight loss regimen.

 **How Does Java Burn Work for Weight Loss?**

The secret behind Java Burn's weight loss abilities lies in its unique blend of natural ingredients. This formula is designed to target various aspects of metabolism, such as increasing thermogenesis, enhancing fat oxidation, and supporting healthy blood sugar levels. By addressing these fundamental factors, Java Burn aims to create a favorable environment for weight loss and overall health improvements.

 One of the key mechanisms of Java Burn is its ability to boost metabolism. The blend of ingredients, including green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chromium, work together to stimulate the body's natural fat-burning processes. This not only helps to increase calorie burn but also supports the body's ability to break down and utilize stored fat more efficiently.

 Additionally, Java Burn is formulated to enhance fat oxidation, which means it helps the body to literally ""burn"" fat for energy. This is achieved through the inclusion of ingredients like Garcinia Cambogia and green coffee bean extract, which have been shown to support healthy fat metabolism.
