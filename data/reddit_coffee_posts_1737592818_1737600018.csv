1i7ta50,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1i7ta50/my_24m_ex_bf_27m_came_back_and_now_wants_to/,My (24M) ex BF (27M) came back and now wants to explore a friendship?,"

My ex bf and I broke up 5 months ago after being together for 6 months. We had a pretty mutual split as there were things for both of us that just weren‚Äôt working. It wasn‚Äôt due to a loss of love; we just didn‚Äôt have great communication. I was willing to try and fix things but he was more stubborn and said we had our answer in front of us. 

  After not speaking for a few months with the exception of one check in where he asked how I was doing, he texted me one day: ‚ÄúTotally fine if you don‚Äôt want to but was gonna ask if you wanted to get coffee or something when I‚Äôm back / maybe in the new year if December is too busy. If I‚Äôm being totally honest I really don‚Äôt like not having you in my life hah üòÖ.‚Äù 

  This brought back a lot of emotion for me and made me realize I definitely was not fully over him. I decided to meet up with him for drinks and we had a nice time but never brought up the past relationship or intentions. We just caught up and it was lighthearted. It made me realize how much I missed him and truly valued my time with him. 

  A few weeks after this I decided to just reach out directly to see where his head was at. I said: ‚ÄúReally glad we got to catch up the other night. To be honest, I had been really missing having you in my life, and when you texted me last month, I wasn‚Äôt sure where your head was at. Just want to make sure we‚Äôre on the same page. Totally cool if you‚Äôd want to talk about it in person.‚Äù 

He responded to me: 
‚ÄúYeah I was really missing you too. I wanted to reach out earlier but also wanted to give you/us space. I‚Äôd really like to explore a friendship with you if possible but totally understand if that‚Äôs not possible for us rn. And yeah happy to talk about it more in person too at any point.‚Äù 

Now I‚Äôm feeling confused on his intentions/feelings. His initial text sounded emotionally charged and like he still had feelings, but after I directly asked him he just wants to explore a friendship? The wording is very vague. I honestly would love to get back with him but also understand that may not be possible. I think hearing from him when he invited me to get drinks really set me back in my healing. Any advice appreciated!!

She is a very charming, funny and beautiful person and we‚Äôve shared a lot of great memories together. 
She has had and currently has alot of emotional problems. Throughout the entirety of our relationship she has had a tough time with anxiety, self-love etc. I have always been there for her. Every time she‚Äôs felt sad I‚Äôve been there to comfort her and take care of her. I still live at home as does she, but I ended up basically moving into her apartment as time went on because with each passing day I took on more and more responsibility as what could be seen as ‚Äòher caretaker‚Äô. Her parents typically stay at a house they own about an hours drive away. Because of her emotional health and lack of structure I lived with her for the better part of one and a half years, cooking her food, cleaning her apartment and, with whatever time i had left, tending to her emotional problems.
I ended up not seeing my family or coming home to my own bed more than at most once every three weeks, typically less. My social life started falling apart, with my friends now referring to the period as when I was practically a ghost. I also started to lose interest in my hobbies and passions, with my teachers noticing how I as a once very dedicated musician started practicing and working a lot less on my passion.
I lost my sense of self in many ways, finding myself completely disinterested in everything I once held close, unsure of who I was, what I wanted and where I wanted to go in life.
She had never told anyone but me about her mental health, not family nor friends, leaving only me to tend to her as the rest were left in the dark. Although I tried countless times to express how I couldn‚Äôt be the sole pillar of her support system she never made a change. She never told her parents, she never sought out professional help, she never tried to find ways to support herself.

A key part for this post is an incident that occurred while we were on vacation last summer. Me, my girlfriend and my friend went on vacation. And one evening, as we were leaving for dinner, my girlfriend refrained from joining us. We went out for dinner and a beer, and when we came back I found my girlfriend sitting out on the balcony floor in a crawled up position. She told me that while we‚Äôd been gone she had climbed over the balcony railing with the intent of taking her life. Thankfully she had a change of heart and she came to no harm. However I drank a couple cups of coffee and stayed up all night watching her and waiting for the suicide hotline to open. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time worrying and being fearful for her safety since.

With time I felt myself crumble under the responsibility, under her emotional luggage as well as my own and my confusion and lost sense of self. I had a complete emotional breakdown about three months ago, where I expressed how I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. After refusing every time it was suggested up until that day, she finally began looking for professional help.
That day I was petrified of my desire to break up, we stuck with it and I‚Äôve been trying to find my footing since. However, although she‚Äôs gotten better the feelings have stuck with me. The problems she had have not magically vanished, it will take time and I truly hope she finds some comfort. The thing is that I‚Äôve sort of reached my limit when it comes to tending to these problems, I‚Äôve tried my best but I‚Äôve got nothing more to give. Since my breakdown I‚Äôve forced her to let me stay at my own house without guilting me through expressing how ‚Äúdeeply saddened she gets‚Äù because I‚Äôm gone for three or more nights, something that has never been possible previously.
While spending more time by myself I‚Äôve rediscovered a lot of things. I‚Äôve once again found the spark of my passions, playing my instrument for hours on end. I‚Äôve discovered new wants and exciting things in my life and I‚Äôm having a blast, feeling thrilled to be my own person again.
I find myself getting deeply frustrated and filled with anxiety when she texts me looking for emotional support because of stuff like ‚Äúmy friend hung out with their friend without asking me‚Äù.  Or writing about things that she‚Äôs sad about such as ‚ÄúI had a breakdown in the stairwell because my parents said I have to cook tonight‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt texted that you love me‚Äù. 
I don‚Äôt want to get upset because I know her feelings are real, but since my breakdown I just can‚Äôt help it, I can‚Äôt take it anymore.
She has said multiple times that she doesn‚Äôt feel loved and appreciated by me which is something that cuts me so deep as I‚Äôve literally devoted my entire life to her.

To the point. I think I can finally admit that I don‚Äôt want to be in this relationship anymore. I‚Äôm a recently graduated 20 year old and I feel really excited to continue finding myself and pursuing exciting things in life.
However my empathy and my feeling of responsibility for my girlfriend goes so deep that I can‚Äôt even come close to actually breaking up. I fear for her. Through neglect she‚Äôs lost a large majority of her friendships and her mother is too self obsessed to truly support my girlfriend. I fear that without me she‚Äôll be overwhelmed by the huge sense of loneliness she already has, and due to her history I fear for her safety. 

What actions can I take to prioritise my own well-being and in turn build up courage? And possibly even ensure her safety.

There‚Äôs a classmate I wanted to befriend because of their engaging conversation style.

In class, I‚Äôm anxious & don‚Äôt speak much, but during this, I actually found the courage to.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

While we were watching the teachers to see if they needed any assistance, I first said something to them.

‚ö™Ô∏è They joked about me looking serious, saying that every time they looked over at me, I had an expression that was like I was going to get a mugshot, which made me laugh. It felt like they were paying attention to me, and when they gave me eye contact, I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling!

‚ö™Ô∏è After that, there wasn't much, but they mentioned the chorus (other students) behind us were good at singing.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

There might be more because I can't fully recall.

We had a break like a few days after. Now it's been almost a month back in school.

I really want to befriend them, but I have no chances. We don't sit near each other and rarely have a chance for interaction. 

They also have friends that they always speak to.

I thought of something. I have a friend who‚Äôs also into music at school. I could ask them about that person, but like that would be weird‚Ä¶ unless I had a reason to mention them.

1i7sqnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i7sqnm/returning_the_bambino_non_plus/,Returning the Bambino (non plus),"I bought the Bambino because I wanted to get into espresso and wanted a good starting machine without spending a fortune.

As much as I enjoy the machine and have bought a few accessories (bottomless portafilter, WDT, scale, etc). I feel that it is not worth the money strictly for the reason that I almost never use the steam wand nor do I enjoy milk drinks. I've mainly been enjoying americano's and espresso.

The things I don't like about the machine-

1) the use of plastics, which isn't fair to the bambino, but I've been trying to cut plastics out of my life.  
2) The continuous dripping after the brew is done and the machine ""sneeze"".

If I do return the bambino and the accessories. I was thinking of investing in a Cafelat Robot, based on some things I saw with it being able to produce better espresso (with more work) and for it being non plastic. 

Some downsides with the robot is definitely going to be boiling my own water; however, I also have been wanting to try Pour Over Coffee so I would need the kettle anyways.

For those of you wondering, I use the Kingrinder K6 as my grinder.   
  
My question is, will the extra money spent be worth it? 

And how hard is it to return through Breville? Is it even possible if I no longer have the original packaging?

If someone truly cares about you they will make time, even if it is for a 5 minute coffee. They are just not interested. This is especially true in the early stages of dating. 

I've experienced this many times with different women who pretend to be too busy. But what's funny is that as soon as we do the do then all of a sudden she's available 25/8 like she's jobless. This has caused me to lose trust in said people and end up breaking up with them where they then act like I broke their heart, but wont have a response about how they lied about being busy all the time prior to being intimate. Honesty is too important to me and if we start off the wrong foot don't be surprised I dont take you seriously.

1i7sood,https://www.reddit.com/r/christianblanco/comments/1i7sood/world_hunger_games_24th_hunger_games_finale/,World Hunger Games: 24th Hunger Games: Finale + Aftermath,"The following morning was marked by many as the final day due to the number of remaining tributes. Early morning cameras spotted Petra looking despondently at her feet. Co-commentators Artemis and Luther were aghast seeing many headshot pictures of Wyborn at her feet with devil horns and short hair drawn with the words ‚ÄúPetron‚Äù spread around the area like a tornado blew in. Petra soon screamed and then produced a sadistically laughing which morphed into a tearful shriek. The bizarre pictures of Wyborn had many citizens in Maximus Square doubled over laughing, especially seeing earlier footage revealing the culprit‚Äôs identity. Artemis laughed hysterically while Luther rolled back the footage. Viewers knew the culprit behind the pictures was Malek (8) and that he received the pictures from a sponsor gift. The note inside read, ‚ÄúI know you love a practical joke‚Äù - FG.¬† In the mentoring gallery, Fabeline Granger (victor of the 15th Hunger Games) chuckled alongside Corpse Beckford (victor of the 10th Hunger Games) where she let slip that Ashley Chen (victor of the 13th Hunger Games) gave her the idea.

Petra‚Äôs hysterics over the mocking photos almost had her miss the ominous sponsor gift box standing in the middle of the room. She mumbled to herself as to whether to open it, trying to reason that no one would send her a bomb. She slowly inched her way towards it and put her hands on the lid. All of Panem fell quiet as Petra opened the box

However, this was no normal sponsor gift. Many viewers were as perplexed as Petra with its contents. It was an oddly shaped devilish rag doll with an eerie resemblance to Barron Moriarty, former mayor of District 1 and infamous runner up of the 3rd Quinquennial Quell. One notable Capital figure did recognize the doll and it was none other than famed historian and former District 7 mentor Armitage Blake. Blake identified the rag doll as a ‚ÄúJack in the Box‚Äù. This children‚Äôs toy was made in District 5 a few years after Ashley Chen‚Äôs victory to help grade school children cope with bullying. Ashley personally elected her co-chairman and business partner Shira Kuzuriyu to bask in the fame, being one of the few citizens ever in the history of Panem granted permission to move to the Capital from the districts.¬† Shira named the toy business the Chen Kuzuru toy vault. A small engraving etched on the box read, ‚ÄúYou belong with him in the rogue‚Äôs gallery‚Äù. 

A petrified Petra yelled out for whomever left the doll to face her. Cameras showed it was in fact Malek that left the Jack and the Box as well as the many Wyborn photos as an elaborate sponsor gift designed to haunt Petra for the Capital‚Äôs amusement. The one aspect to this practical joke that befuddled viewers was the sender of the Jack in the Box as there was no sponsor note. Both Armitage Blake and Fabeline denied sending it, but Artemis had a strong feeling of who orchestrated the prank.

Ashley Chen (victor of the 13th Hunger Games) smiled at her work alongside Phoebe in the mentoring gallery. An amused Phoebe turned to Ashley and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs progress. Guess that helped?‚Äù. Ashley proudly laughed and embraced her friend. She smiled saying that she owed her‚Äù after last year with Penny doing her best to help out little Torro. Ashley joked, ‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs funny. After everything the Wybastard did to me, I married his older brother. Imagine if your psychic gets with Mirabelle.‚Äù Phoebe chuckled a bit but was unsure what to think of that but shrugged saying ‚ÄúIt would be up to her.‚Äù

Petra‚Äôs confusion and anxiety turned to rage as she ripped the head off the rag doll and threw it across the room. She screamed at the walls that she wasn‚Äôt a rapist and did nothing wrong. She angrily ripped the pictures to shreds and stormed out of the room, determined to find a weapon and end the games once and for all. Little did she know, Malek (8) was hiding inside a broom closet listening to her nervous breakdown and holding in his laughter giggling ‚ÄúGirl‚Äôs hiding so much tea. Tune in, viewers!‚Äù

The laughter heard in Maximus Square was cut short when Petra paused mere steps away from Malek‚Äôs closet. She turned around slowly and quizzically inspected the door. She stood outside of it for a few seconds. Malek bursted through the door, causing Petra to fall backwards. Malek tried to run away but Petra swept his feet out from under him. She leapt onto his back and used one hand to push his head down. Malek had his knife but couldn‚Äôt reach behind him to cut her. Petra used her other hand to wrestle the knife out of his hand and stab him in the back. She proceeded to stab his back in a frenzy while Malek grunted and spat out blood. Petra paused her stabbing after the ninth one and waited for the cannon. Malek shifted his head slightly and gurgled his final words, ‚ÄúI love you Phineas‚Äù receiving¬† fourteen knife strikes to the neck. Malek‚Äôs cannon sounded instantly, followed by sighs of despair heard in Maximus Square. 

Artemis felt bummed out as she was rooting for him, calling Petra a crazy ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù, a Capital slang term used for prideful, arrogant women. With Luther saying in return to this ‚ÄúI would have preferred it to be him that won Granger‚Äôs games.‚Äù Luther received immediate backlash from many Capital viewers for this comment, mostly from her fans, Hunger Games analysts, and Artemis herself. Fabeline was rang in for Luther to give a public apology, which she accepted but not without a comeback of her own, ‚ÄúYou already had one. Backstabbing Copper.‚Äù

Every remaining tribute had heard the cannon and were unnerved by its close proximity. Back in the cornucopia, Consul (3) was incredibly stressed by how loud it was. Timber (7) had his axe at the ready and asked Phineas if he had any visions as to who that was. Phineas wasn‚Äôt in the mood to guess and was more concerned about when the gamemakers would announce the end. Timber joked, ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs your crazy boyfriend. One would hope.‚Äù Phineas laughed before saying ‚ÄúI may like both genders but I have nothing for that loose screw. He messed with my wee brother from another mother. Besides, he loves my readings, not me.‚Äù Consul giggled and insisted he was strong, thrusting his knife in the air. Phineas dug around the scattered supplies for another weapon and settled on an axe. He struggled to pick it up so Timber gave him a different knife instead. He commented how without his ‚Äúpowers‚Äù, he would‚Äôve never made it past the bloodbath.¬†

The two debated on their next strategy, wondering why the gamemakers hadn‚Äôt announced anything yet. Timber (7) lamented this as he would feel bad killing them. Phineas and Timber mulled over their next move while Consul was tightening the woolen slippers ten meters away. Phineas did a head count of the remaining tributes and discerned that there were two tributes left for them to face. The only reason the gamemakers would hold off their announcement would be if one of them was nearby. As soon as he said this, his eyes widened and he called out for Consul. Timber became worried but there was an ear shattering scream of ‚ÄúHEY PSYCHIC!!‚Äù

The two boys turned to see Ruggero (1) holding Consul (3) hostage with his axe. Phineas demanded he let the boy go. Ruggero chastised him for being sentimental with the games coming to an end. Timber stepped closer but Ruggero gave Consul one stab in the shoulder. The boy screamed in pain, pressuring Phineas to stop Timber. Phineas asked Ruggero what he wanted and why he didn‚Äôt just kill Consul. Ruggero mockingly inquired if he had another reading to tell him. Phineas guessed it was because he thought this hostage situation would score him the Golden Victor status. Timber chuckled at this hypothesis, teasing Ruggero for thinking that would work. He pointed to Phineas and let slip he received five sponsor gifts. ‚ÄúIf anyone is making Golden Victor, it‚Äôs this handsome specimen!‚Äù

Ruggero (1) was stunned for a second before saying, ‚ÄúTo hell with it then.‚Äù In a swift motion, Ruggero plunged his axe into Consul‚Äôs back. Phineas screamed, ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù Timber brandished his axe and chased after Ruggero down the halls yelling obscenities that required censoring. Phineas rushed to Consul‚Äôs side and began crying over the loss of his friend. Consul tearfully thanked him for being a big brother and asked him to promise to try and win. He soon took out an amber bracelet and gave it to Phineas saying ‚ÄúLinker gave this to me. You have it.‚Äù Through sobs, Phineas held his hand and promised to win for him. Consul requested he look into Phineas‚Äôs eyes one last time. Phineas hastily wiped the tears away and stared longingly in his fallen ally‚Äôs eyes. Consul‚Äôs final words were, ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù.¬†

Minutes after Consul‚Äôs cannon sounded, Head Gamemaker Cardew‚Äôs voice boomed through the arena. She congratulated the final four tributes and it was time to end things. Cardew explained that a poisonous gas would be pumped into the arena and the only refuge was the hospital rooftop. She assured them the hallway lights would lead the way and wished everyone luck.

Phineas cursed Cardew for waiting so long to give the announcement. He put his mixed emotions aside and spotted the illuminated hallway lights. He sprinted down the hallways as fast as he could. As he was climbing the stairs to the second floor, he heard another cannon sound followed by a grunt of pain one story above. Phineas hurried up the stairs and was surprised to see Ruggero (1)‚Äôs corpse draped over the banister. Slumped against the wall with a hole in his stomach was Timber.¬†

Timber was relieved to see Phineas and asked him to help him up. He wanted to help him defeat Petra before he ‚Äúbecame one of the ghosts in his head‚Äù. Phineas agreed and used all of his strength to hoist him up. The two hobbled their way down the third story hall to the final stairwell leading to the roof. They successfully made it to the stairwell and climbed it until they happened upon the door leading outside. Timber weakly pushed the door open only to be met with an axe to the head.

Petra was the first to make it to the rooftop and was waiting by the door. Timber‚Äôs cannon sounded and he fell backwards. Thinking quickly, Phineas released his grip on Timber‚Äôs body and slid past Petra, but not without slicing into her side. He rushed ahead to put some distance between him and Petra, nearly toppling over the edge. He cringed at the sight of the broken slabs of concrete with rebar poking out on the ground. He turned to face Petra, who was charging at him full speed. She couldn‚Äôt retrieve the axe she had so she settled on a knife. Phineas tried to run around her, but she slashed wildly and reopened the wound on his left ear. Phineas clutched his ear in pain and yelled, ‚ÄúWhat is wrong with you?!‚Äù 

Petra roared in anger and tackled him to the ground. Phineas‚Äôs head bounced off the ground, dazing him. He tried to fight back, but she pinned his left arm down. Petra proceeded to stab him twice in the gut. She cursed him egregiously and growled that she wasn‚Äôt like Wyborn. Phineas swore he never accused her of being such a thing and defiantly asked, ‚ÄúWhat are you then lass?‚Äù Petra yelled at him for making a fool out of her. Phineas spat blood from his mouth and said, ‚ÄúYou chased Mirabelle away and let that consume you. You did the fool thing all by yourself!‚Äù¬†

Phineas reached around with all his strength and fished out the scalpel he held onto throughout the duration of the games. With one swift motion, he thrust the scalpel deep into Petra‚Äôs ear cavity. Petra opened her mouth to scream but nothing came out. Phineas released the scalpel and shimmied himself from under her. He tried to drag himself away but Ptera stopped him by plunging the knife into his left leg. Phineas reached for a nearby rock and used it to bash the scalpel further into Petra‚Äôs ear. Petra writhed on the ground in silent pain, giving Phineas enough time to drag himself to the roof‚Äôs edge to pull himself to his feet. He used it as support while clutching his still heavily bleeding stomach wounds. As he was too weak to finish her off, Petra was able to pull herself up as well. She wobbled slightly, dazed by the disgusting ear injury. She was too dazed to realize she didn‚Äôt have a weapon. Petra threw herself over to the dying Phineas and tried to push him over the edge. What she didn‚Äôt know was that he had firmly clutched her hospital gown. With a vindictive smile, Phineas grinned whispering ‚ÄúDie you sadistic jezzebel twat‚Äù, before he fell backwards off the roof, dragging her down with him.¬†

All of Panem gasped in horror as both tributes fell to the ground. The sound of two cannons in rapid succession rang throughout the arena. 

All of Maximus Square was deathly quiet. Not even co-commentators Artemis and Luther could say anything. Head Gamemaker Cardew scrambled to fix things, so she assured viewers she had everything under control. 

The retrieval team landed in record time and swiftly surrounded the two tributes crumpled on the concrete floor next to each other. Capital viewers couldn‚Äôt see what was happening and held onto each other waiting for any sort of development. Suddenly, a few members of the retrieval team became more frantic and were making use of AED coils attached to a bulk battery. After a few tense moments of bright lights and yelling, one of the medical personnel nodded to the chief. The chief spoke into his earpiece. Head Gamemaker Cardew‚Äôs voice came on and with great relief announced that Phineas Ellingboe of District 6 had been successfully revived and was now the victor of the 24th Hunger Games.¬†

All of Maximus Square erupted into immense fits of cheering and celebration. In the commentator‚Äôs booth, Artemis and Luther leapt out of their seats and embraced each other. The mentoring gallery was also filled with joy. Everyone present was embracing Phoebe and congratulating her. There were many tears to go around, but Phineas‚Äôs journey was far from over.

Phineas was quickly airlifted to the Maximus Hospital. The many injuries were very serious and required hours of surgery. His two stomach stab wounds resulted in internal bleeding and were thankfully resolved, but one of his kidneys had to be removed. The left leg was heavily damaged by not only the stab wound, but a fractured tibia and patella. The left ear was stitched together nicely and was expected to recover fully. There was also a hairline fracture on the right side of his skull.¬†

During the frenzy of medical operations and surgery procedures, the doctors made a shocking discovery. An MRI of Phineas‚Äôs brain revealed a benign tumor the size of a golf ball, which explained the migraines Phineas was inflicted with. The final operation was spent on removing the tumor from his brain to ensure no future chronic symptoms. The surgery was a success and every doctor in the hospital celebrated. His victor's interview was delayed by two months for time to recuperate. The only visitor permitted to visit the unconscious victor was Phoebe, who sat by his bedside waiting for him to wake up.¬†

After a week of being under a coma, Phineas awoke seeing a gravely exhausted Phoebe struggling to stay awake. Phineas grinned weakly at the sight of his mentor but was immediately befallen by the discomfort of his injuries. Chief surgeon Hollis Taylor came in to check on him and deliver the prognosis. The stomach wounds, eviscerated ear, and cracked skull were expected to completely heal. Phineas perked at the mention of his skull, concerned about his migraines. Taylor told him about the tumor and its removal, assuring him that he was free from it. Phineas cried tears of joy, finally feeling relief after years of chronic pain. 

Dr. Taylor stopped him as he saved the worst news for last. Phineas‚Äôs leg was damaged more than anticipated. While the knee bone would recover, his tibia had to be replaced with an iron rod. The force of the bone breaking severed a nerve, so he would need support to walk for the rest of his life. Phineas was disappointed by the news but it was overshadowed by the joy of being alive.¬†

Phoebe stayed with Phineas the entire day and talked about the fun things she had planned for them and ‚Äúsome friends‚Äù in the Capital while he recovered. Phineas could tell this was a diversion and asked if she talked to Mirabelle. Phoebe‚Äôs face fell and she nodded,¬† ‚ÄúShe told me what Petra did. She wasn‚Äôt quite like Wyborn but I‚Äôm still processing.‚Äù Phineas smiled and said he was so sorry for Mirabelle. Phoebe smiled before hugging him saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just so happy you won over her.‚Äù Phineas wanted to know the real story but Phoebe heard they would discuss it in the *AfterGames* show.

The next day, Phineas was allowed more visitors and had a heartfelt albeit brief reunion with Morrana. Hours later, Candace Freeman (victor of the 4th Hunger Games) arrived in gently guiding a tear stained Linker. Phoebe softened, seeing the sad thirteen year old mentor. Phineas offered to return the amber bracelet Consul gave him. Linker cried before shouting, ‚ÄúWHY COULDN'T YOU SAVE HIM!!‚Äù. He proceeded to tearfully punch Phineas in the chest. As the doctors tried to remove Linker, Phineas ordered them to stop. He asked Phoebe and Candace if they could leave them be.¬†

Linker began to cry before Phineas smiled, telling the boy to sit. Phineas and Linker had a deep tearful discussion about Consul in the hour leading up to the post-games recap. Phineas deduced the two knew each other, with Linker revealing that Consul was a friend in school who loved making jewelry and laughing at his jokes. Phineas laughed gently saying ‚ÄúFirst year as mentor and he ranked fifth. Not bad laddie.‚Äù Linker smiled and laughed. Linker denied Consul's bracelet and Phineas promised to wear it always. Phoebe and Candace reentered the room and the four watched the live recap together.

The *AfterGames* show hosted by former gamemaker Jasper Deparnieux was an opportunity to relive the greatest moments of the games and get people‚Äôs reactions. It also served as the post-games interview for Head Gamemaker Cardew for the behind the scenes scoop. The Capital enjoyed this year‚Äôs games, with the common sentiment that while not as great as the previous two, it had some great moments to enjoy. The most lauded moments of the game were the medicine feast and the rooftop fight in the finale. Head Gamemaker Cardew gained inspiration for the feast from the supply run in the 5th Hunger Games. She believed this particular event should be considered a recurring event to help liven the games when becoming stale. Deparnieux asked her about the finale as like all of Panem, his heart stopped when both cannons sounded. Cardew incredulously exclaimed, ‚ÄúYour heart stopped? How did you think I felt?!‚Äù She felt immense relief when Phineas was able to be saved and looks forward to seeing what he did next.¬†

Deparnieux felt immense relief it was him and not Petra. Cardew agreed as she didn‚Äôt want another ‚ÄúWybastard‚Äù infecting her games. Deparnieux surprised everyone by revealing that Phoebe‚Äôs daughter Mirabelle told the *Juicy Tidbits* podcast the full story. 

Seven months before the reaping, Petra was at a low point when her last classmate quit her fitness class and one of her estranged siblings died of a warmweed overdose. Mirabelle was comforting her and promised that she would still be there for her. Petra suddenly kissed her and Mirabelle was taken aback. She pushed Petra away and scolded her for having the wrong idea. Petra did not react accordingly and Mirabelle was concerned for her safety. Mirabelle ended their friendship right there, but Petra wouldn‚Äôt let it go. She threatened to harm herself if she abandoned her and to prevent this, Mirabelle relented. Mirabelle stated that while she was very sad over Petra‚Äôs death, she felt she was long gone a long time ago. When pressed on why she visited Petra before she was shipped off, Mirabelle replied, ‚ÄúForgive and forget. I knew deep down she wouldn‚Äôt come back.‚Äù

Cardew was greatly surprised by the story, but it didn‚Äôt make her any less happy Phineas won. Deparnieux personally wished for Timber to win as he considered him quite a character. Cardew had her bets on Phineas the entire duration of the games, blushing when Deparnieux excused it to his ‚Äúgalaxy eyes‚Äù. Deparnieux was unsure of Phineas receiving the Golden Victor title but Cardew argued that the finale alone cemented it for her. Her last statement was to urge viewers to vote for Phineas to be the latest Golden Victor.

A few days after the post-games analysis, Phineas was granted leave from the hospital. While being wheeled out to the limousine, Candace offered Phineas an entertainment contract similar to Linker‚Äôs, insinuating that he could start his own mentalist show. Phineas took one look at her and said, ‚ÄúSorry lass. I‚Äôm never going to perform again.‚Äù Candace understood and said to not be surprised if the Capital forces him into modelling. Phineas laughed and said, ‚ÄúI heard galaxy eyes are in right now.‚Äù¬†

The remaining weeks leading up to the victor‚Äôs interview included Phineas being introduced to the other victors. The most shocking thing to him was how no one asked for a reading, except Spruce Queensberry (victor of the 19th Hunger Games). Phineas bluntly told him to lay off the cigars or the spirit of Knockwood would smother him in his sleep. Spruce chuckled and admitted he was impressed. Phineas rebutted that Vixen told him to say the last part.¬†

On days when Phoebe had errands to run, most of the victors would volunteer to watch over him. Phineas later reported to enjoy the company of Mortimer and Meridia Beckett the most. He and Mortimer had lengthy conversations about the SHC extraction process and prescriptions while Meridia tattooed an eagle on his shoulder, some norway spruce vines on his arms, and the names of Consul and Timber on the back of his wrist. Linker and Ashley Chen (victor of the 13th Hunger Games) played video games with him. Even Tris Plummer (victor of the 8th Hunger Games) made a visit and taught Phineas how to paint, being very impressed on how quickly he learned these skills.¬†

On the day before the victor‚Äôs interview, Phineas celebrated his nineteenth birthday with Phoebe, Morrana, and several of his fellow victors. Many of the victors Phineas bonded with over the weeks returned home, but it gave him the chance to be properly acquainted with Bacchus Johnson (victor of the 9th Hunger Games) and Spruce. Fabeline Granger (victor of the 15th Hunger Games) was also in attendance, but she was very distracted and withdrawn. When Candace checked on her friend, Fabeline felt upset over Malek‚Äôs death and how brutal it was. Candace tried to console her, but she lashed out and pushed her into the large silver vanilla mousse cake personally crafted by renowned pastry chef Puck Decasse, the same chef that created Ashley Chen‚Äôs iconic birthday cake for her games. 

Phineas and all those in attendance were in absolute shock by what occurred. Fabeline stood in the middle of the room feeling gravely embarrassed upon realizing what she had done. An upset Phineas composed himself and calmly said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt survive a flipping murder game for you to ruin my birthday. On behalf of Candace and the cake you desecrated, FUCK YOU!!‚Äù 

Fabeline ran out of the room and was never seen for the remainder of the night. Quarry Grounds and Laika Brown cleaned Candace up while Bacchus salvaged the party by having Phineas sample the newest specialty cocktail from *Johnson‚Äôs Jazzy Juices* in honor of him called the *Mystics Elixir.*¬†

The victor‚Äôs interview had finally arrived after the longest wait in Hunger Games history. Artemis and Luther had a few opening jokes at Petra‚Äôs expense. Luther talked to Phoebe on the phone and her best theory was Petra suffered from borderline personality disorder. Artemis joked she was a ‚Äúborderline Wybastard‚Äù.¬†

Phineas hobbled onto the stage wearing a basic black and white tuxedo with silver shoes and rings on his finger. The one item that stood out the most was his hand carved wooden cane with a golden handle. Artemis started everything off by commenting how much of a scare he gave them. Phineas quipped, ‚ÄúImagine how I felt hurtling down three stories. My life flashed before me eyes.‚Äù He added that he felt immense relief to be free from his migraines and that he could better enjoy life. Artemis joked that with his ‚Äúbum leg‚Äù, he would still have to rely on warmweed. Phineas shrugged and proclaimed that he would take leg pain over another migraine any day.¬†

Luther asked if he was ever scared during the games. Phineas admitted to being scared most of the time, especially of Petra, but was thankful to have been surrounded by his allies. Artemis wondered what he thought about the truth behind Petra and Mirabelle‚Äôs relationship. Phineas suspected a falling out but didn‚Äôt expect the severity, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty f\*\*\*\*\* up if you ask me.‚Äù 

Artemis teased, ‚ÄúNo readings huh?‚Äù Phineas rolled his eyes and insisted what he said during the games was all true. Luther asked what he would tell his mothers since their belief in the spiritual was genuine. Phineas said he would tell them he ""surrendered his powers‚Äù in exchange for another chance at life.

Luther switched to what he thought about the other tributes, specifically his allies. Phineas felt sympathy for Fabeline over Malek‚Äôs death but personally felt relieved he wasn‚Äôt the one to stop him. Artemis claimed she would‚Äôve been furious if he was the one to kill Consul. Phineas tensed upon hearing his name. He expressed his wish that Consul and Timber won beside him as they were his first true friends. He attributed his survival to both of them and would continue to grieve their deaths. Luther assured him that one day, there will be a games like that. Artemis spotted their names on his wrist, asking if Meridia etched them on for him. Phineas confirmed this and said that he had the full support of his victor friends to guide him. Luther asked what he would do when he gets home. Phineas playfully said he would hug his brothers and have a talk with his mothers. He swore to help Phoebe run the Kento Rehabilitation Centre and possibly start a partnership with Mortimer. Artemis and Luther dismissed Phineas to rapturous applause as ‚ÄúThe Mystic Man‚Äù, which became his victor‚Äôs nickname.

Phineas departed from the Capital the next day but not before stopping at the Java Juniper coffee shop for one last get together with Linker and Ashley. Phineas and Phoebe discussed future plans on the hoverjet journey back, but their conversations continuously revert back to the Capital‚Äôs potential plans for him.¬†

Phineas returned to a hero‚Äôs welcome in District 6. He had an emotional reunion with his mother and brothers right on the reaping stage. The family and Phoebe were welcomed to a celebratory dinner with Mayor Rotom followed by a fundraiser to distribute the year‚Äôs food supply to those in need.¬†

The entire Ellingboe family was moved to Victor‚Äôs Village to the house next to Phoebe‚Äôs. Phineas‚Äôs mothers accepted Phineas‚Äôs ‚Äúpower surrender‚Äù story and all decided to disband the mystic shows. Phoebe received a call from one the Capital‚Äôs finest genealogists and asked if he wanted to find any biological relatives. Phineas agreed at his brothers‚Äô behest. 

Three weeks later, he was surprised to learn that he had a paternal uncle named Herald Larsen, who had given up his search for his brother‚Äôs child seven weeks after his birth. It was revealed through records that Phineas‚Äôs biological parents Ulga and Joseph Larsen were killed by peacekeepers for violently resisting arrest after getting caught smuggling bootleg warmweed to farmers. With Phoebe‚Äôs help, Phineas tracked down Herald and the two had an emotional reunion. Phineas brought Herald home to Victor‚Äôs Village and his adoptive family welcomed him with open arms. Herald was also granted a job as security guard for the rehabilitation centre and Phineas‚Äôs personal bodyguard.

Candace‚Äôs warning about the Capital came into fruition almost immediately after Phineas returned him. The Capital tried to rope Phineas into a modelling contract, going as far as to threaten his uncle Herald. However, with the help of Candace‚Äôs connections and Jase Toliver‚Äôs legal expertise, a compromise was settled. Phineas would perform mentalist shows for the guests of the Luxury Viking Cruise, the week-long cruise trip that sailed the seas of Districts 4 and 6 and toured the Faroe Island Base three times a year.¬†

Phineas continued to help Phoebe treat patients at the rehabilitation center. He took it upon himself to begin an education in medicine and soon became District 6‚Äôs chief doctor and pharmacist. His power of keen observation and deduction made him an incredibly talented physician with near perfect accurate diagnoses rate. 

A partnership between him and Mortimer Beckett formed and the two men helped mass produce pain medication based on warmweed and gillyweed. Phineas became a well regarded and beloved member of the community. He was especially popular with schoolchildren and would often make special visits to do lectures on personal health.

Phineas was one of the most beloved victors in Hunger Games history. He grew very close to Phoebe and always worked alongside her at the rehabilitation centre. The two worked well together as mentors and didn‚Äôt have to wait many years for their next victor. Phineas also grew incredibly close with Linker Nyugen and Ashley Chen, and the three developed a close sibling like relationship. The three would fraternize during Hunger Games season often and always make time to hang out together. Phineas became great friends with Mortimer and Meridia Beckett, often seen interacting with them as well. Surprisingly, he and Spruce Queensberry grew fond of each other as well with the latter offering a few self defense lessons. The lessons proved to come in handy in a few situations with unsavory characters in District 6.

Phineas had to undergo physical therapy for months after his return home to better learn how to walk. His leg would never truly heal, and he had to depend on a cane and more warmweed prescriptions for the rest of his life. Two weeks before Christmas, Phineas fell down a flight of stairs while on his way home from working at the Kento Rehabilitation Centre. He was uninjured but his cane snapped in half. Fortunately, unbeknownst to him, Phoebe called in a favor from Quarry Grounds (victor of the 12th Hunger Games) and Phineas was gifted a custom-made cane hand carved from a weeping fig tree fitted with a fire opal handle for Christmas.

When it came to his love life, Phineas had only one person in his sights. Mirabelle was anointed his physical therapist and would spend two days a week helping him stretch and exercise his bad leg. The two bonded very quickly and were married after seven months of dating with Phoebe herself officiating the wedding. The couple suffered two miscarriages before welcoming their first child into the world a month before the 29th Hunger Games. They had three sons and two daughters. Phineas named two of his sons Consul and Timothy, after his fallen friends.

Phineas became a subject of mass speculation during the *Phoenix Fighters* after the five Golden Victors disappeared in response to Savannah Pickett (victor of the 6th Hunger Games)‚Äôs death before the 41st Hunger Games. While he continued to remain in the Capital‚Äôs good graces, there were many who suspected he was a spy for the terrorist organization on account of his gifts. However, there was no proof of this and Phineas was permitted to continue living in District 6 peacefully.¬†

The investigation was reopened after an anonymous source ousted Phineas for rigging the results of the 56th Hunger Games, resulting in his imprisonment at Wolvson Maximum Security Prison. During his stay there, new evidence was unearthed on the Faroe Island Base after a squadron of rebels attacked the island and were vanquished by peacekeepers. The rumors of Phineas being a spy for the *Phoenix Fighters* was accurate and there was evidence that pointed to him running a warmweed smuggling ring to supply them with the drug. Phineas was set to be executed for treason against the Capital. However, similar to Meridia Beckett, after the 58th Hunger Games, he was rescued by the *Phoenix Fighters.* He became one of the lead architects in orchestrating the attacks on District 9‚Äôs border after the 82nd Hunger Games, which led to his death at the hands of future president Prometha Heavensbee. He was seventy-eight years old and heroically gave his life for the liberation of Panem. He would be remembered by all as a wise, kind spirit. ",1,1737598039.0,christianblanco,1,1.0,False

It's long, so prepare yourself if you haven't left already.

Would rather someone closer to me, but open to talking to any lurking lass that might be interested. Into being sweet and sensual with a firm but gentle grip.

Prefer someone that doesn't have kids and doesn't want kids. Would also like someone that enjoys to game from time to time, or doesnt mind that I enjoy my gaming myself. Someone that's introverted and enjoys their alone time as well would also be nice. Because as much as I'd like us to have fun when we're with each other, I'd enjoy having time to myself to recharge every so often as well.

I game, write, teach myself music, and exercise in my free time. Because I don't really have a reason to go out, or someone to go out with.

I am the only one who does dishes, takes trash out, sweeps, vaccumes, literally everything. My roommate does her own laundry. 

For the past few days my daughter has been with her father, my ex husband, and I have only been home a total of 8 hours for the past 3 days due to work. My roommate only worked 7 hours a day any my boyfriend works 10. But today they both called in to their jobs because of the weather (we got close to a foot of snow in the last 24 hours). I had to go to work. 

I do a lot of driving for my job and the past free days have been even more so. I left Sunday night at 11pm and got home Monday morning around 8am. I did some cleaning in the bathroom and took a shower them slept till probably 8pm. When I got up I had to do some laundry for work then left again around midnight Tuesday morning for work. I didn't get done with work till 2am Wednesday. And had to leave again at 10am for work again. I didn't get done with my job till almost 8pm.

We get home and again he didn't grab anything, just walked inside. 

I get inside and he said that him and our roommate had started cleaning but nothing, and I mean NOTHING was done.

I want to cry, I want to scream, I want to kick them both out. But I can't do any of that. Because it will do absolutely no good. I can't afford my apartment on my own in this economy. 

So I'm just stuck being the only one doing anything around the house as well as paying most of the bills. 

I'm not asking for advice on what to do, or what I should say. There is nothing that will help. I just need to wait it out till I have enough saved up to be on my own without needing help with bills. Then I can just leave them on their own.",0,1737597903.0,Rants,0,0.5,False

Weight Lifting Routine: Push Pull Legs Rest

Hello everyone, I need some help troubleshooting the carnivore diet.  I am 100% Strict ever since November 1st 2024 and started Carnivore on October 17, 2024.  I only eat beef, salt, and reverse osmosis water with mineral drops.  I have a coffee 0-2 times a week < 100mg.

I was not very hungry at the beginning of the diet and would only eat a pound to 2 pounds a day of fatty meat.  I dropped down from 240 to 220 by November 14, and began going to the gym starting November 14.  My weight loss began to stall, so I decided to try some PSMF meals by having chicken breast and shrimp only for lean days.  I then dropped from 220 to 217 pounds by December 14, 2024, so not much loss at all.

From December 14, 2024 - Jan 7, 2025 I had a vacation visiting Hawaii where my family lives and I remained strict throughout the holidays.  Surprisingly, I ate a lot during this time, all the Ribeyes, Brisket, and Flanken short ribs I wanted.  I also did throw in a few PSMF days.  When I returned to Colorado, I noticed that I was down to 209lbs.  This was amazing, but I did not know why or how I lost weight that trip when I ate a lot and continued to weight train.

When I returned to Colorado, I began to turn up the intesity of my weight lifting workouts.  I have been getting consistent strength gains on my Push Pull Legs Rest split.  Due to pushing my intensity up, I have a ravenous hunger.  I would eat 2-3 times a day and throughout the day I would eat anywhere from 2-4 pounds of fatty meat like brisket, flaken short ribs, and 85/15 ground beef.  I would also eat anywhere from 6-12 eggs in addition.  My sodium intake has increased because I am eating more.  I just salt to taste.  I also have been drinking more water.  I usually drink 4 liters a day, I am now drinking 5 or 6 liters.

My weight is slowly creeping up which is not the goal and as of this post on Jan 22, 2025 I am up to 211.  I know this is minimal, but over 2 weeks, all I see is weight gain.  I do understand that this can be water retention as well as muscle gain.  I am looking significantly better, and I am sleeping very well with the fatty meals, and I have good energy levels which leads to good performance at work.  I have a mentally stressful job as I am in the Tech Industry.

I have been looking to see if I should make any adjustments.  I was wondering if I should include an OMAD on my weigh lifting rest days, do a prolonged fast to shake up the weight loss, bring back PSMF days, or just try to eat less?  Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

**Questions:**

* **Has anyone ever encountered stalls like I have?**
* **Should I continue to do the same thing or tweak the diet?**
* **Should I focus on other measurements like waist size?**
* **Should I try to reduce Food, Sodium, or Water Intake??**

TLDR: Lost a good amount of weight on carnivore.  Hitting weight loss stalls.  Weight lifting intensity went up, causing increased hunger.  Gaining weight again.

I appreciate the help in advance.  I want to bring up this scenario to Anthony Chaffee during his next live Q&A.",1,1737597689.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started!

If it‚Äôs bad I‚Äôll do it multiple times a day. Only stopping when I run out of hot water. 

- I am taking levothyroxine and Zoloft but my symptoms started before I began talking either one. 

- I do not use any drugs or alcohol. I drink black and green tea, and rarely decaf coffee. I sometimes take iron pills and take zinc and elderberry immunity gummies on a daily basis. My symptoms proceeded this. 

- I have Vasovagal syncope due to vomiting or pain and have almost blacked out multiple times. I also have blood pooling in my legs but I tested negative for pots on a basic sitting VS standing test.

I started a dirty fast last week (last meal being Tuesday night). Since then, the only calories I consume are coffee with minimal unsweetened almond milk and at times, some hot cocoa. The daily calories amount to 100  - 200. I was more concerned about losing weight and fat rather than the other benefits, but I'm thinking of switching to a cleaner fast from tomorrow onwards. I started at 111kg and am only down to 105kg at the moment, so 6kg lost.

Last year, I did a 10 day pure-ish water fast (only drank rooibos tea and black coffee) and managed to lose 10kg in that period. That is accounting for water weight gained after refeeding. I went from 99kg to 89kg.

Does anyone have any experience doing the same? I'm hoping this will help with the weight loss and also gain some extra benefits as well, hopefully help clearing skin marks and so on.

She said Yes and later on we exchanged numbers and grabbed coffee. The day we grabbed coffee though I messed up big time I was dressed in casual clothes (khaki shorts,and a t shirt) while she was in a nice dress. She made it seem like it‚Äôd be more of a casual hangout. I also got there specifically on time while it seemed like she was there for awhile. Anyways I was extremely nervous and was not acting like myself almost the whole time without realizing it was because I rushed things because I broke up with a long-term girlfriend (2 1/2 years) only two weeks before we grabbed coffee. She asked an important question as well that I did not realize at the time was something important to her in a relationship and I basically rushed my answer out. Essentially, I messed up big time and was not acting like myself. A day later she texted basically saying ‚ÄúHey thanks for your time out of your day, I‚Äôve been thinking about but let‚Äôs just stay as friends and I hope that doesn‚Äôt ruin anything‚Äù.

It was 08:30, and he thought he would pick up a coffee from the Earth Caf√© before heading to the office. His office was within walking distance of the caf√©. He wasn‚Äôt a coffee person, yet some days he didn‚Äôt mind trying it.

He ordered his usual Cortado, as he had developed a liking for it. It was stronger than a cappuccino and lighter than an espresso. He paid and was waiting for his takeaway cup. Today, it was taking longer than usual. Then, a young barista walked up to him and said, ‚ÄúSir, we have run out of takeaway cups. Can I serve you here? You can sit and enjoy your coffee, sir.‚Äù

Frustrated, he scolded the young barista. He glanced at the calendar and noticed his first meeting was at 09:30 ‚Äî an interview with Namit for HR.

Reluctantly, he agreed to sit and asked the barista to make it quick. He sat down and looked around. The caf√© was nearly empty, except for a young woman in formal attire sitting at the table next to him.

The barista brought him his coffee in a beautiful mug, accompanied by a large muffin.

Annoyed, he told the barista that he hadn‚Äôt ordered a muffin. The barista replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on the house,‚Äù and apologized again for not being able to serve his coffee in a takeaway cup.

He settled in, and his attention was drawn to the young woman at the next table. She was busy reviewing some printouts she had brought with her. The same barista served her coffee, and she said, ‚ÄúThank you, Gaurav.‚Äù That was when he realized the barista was wearing a name tag with ‚ÄúGaurav,‚Äù something he hadn‚Äôt noticed before.

The muffin the barista had served was delicious, and he considered ordering another. As he stood up and walked toward the counter, he accidentally hit the chair next to the woman and fell.

Gaurav rushed over to help him up. He stood up and was fine, though it seemed he had slipped on the wet floor without noticing.

Now he saw that Gaurav was speaking to the woman, who appeared to have spilled coffee on her white formal shirt. He quickly realized that when he had fallen, he had knocked over the chair, causing her coffee to spill.

He walked up to her, but before he could apologize, she asked him if he was okay. He was embarrassed now. 

He apologized to the woman, who now had visible stains on her shirt. She was trying to call someone on her phone.

He returned to his seat to finish his coffee and the muffin he had ordered. Gaurav had removed the chair between their tables, and now he was sitting almost at arm‚Äôs length from the young woman. She was facing away from him, speaking to someone on the phone.

‚ÄúNisha Ma‚Äôam, can you please shift the meeting to 12?‚Äù
‚ÄúSorry, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam, I‚Äôve reached the office but spilled coffee on my shirt.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt look good, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù
‚ÄúSorry, just give me two hours, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

It seemed like the person on the other end had hung up, as the young woman sat with her head in her hands.

‚ÄúCoffee for Namita!‚Äù shouted the barista.

She walked to the counter to pick up her coffee. It looked like the caf√© had prepared another one for her.

Suddenly, his phone rang. It was a call from his HR manager.

‚ÄúSir, I‚Äôm canceling your interview at 09:30 and will find another candidate.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúSir, the candidate doesn‚Äôt seem serious. She‚Äôs giving some silly excuse about spilling coffee on her shirt. I‚Äôve been in HR long enough to know when someone‚Äôs lying. She‚Äôs not interested, sir. I‚Äôll arrange for another candidate.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs her name?‚Äù
‚ÄúSir, Namita. I think I mistakenly wrote Namit in the meeting invite.‚Äù

He noticed the young woman collecting her folder and preparing to leave the caf√©.

‚ÄúNamita!‚Äù he called out.

‚ÄúGaurav, get two coffees, please‚Äîone for Namita and one for me.‚Äù

If each human were to possess one of the seven deadly sins, then my sin would be gluttony. Despite the fact that I like drinking alcohol and coffee I could easily stop drinking both for good. I have never gotten withdrawal effects from stopping either in the past and I can go a long time without them too. Things that are genuinely hard for me to stop for a while are eating junk food and wasting my precious time on the internet.  
  
Caffeine and alcohol don‚Äôt even come close to either of these vices of mine. When I‚Äôm not eating junk food there seems to be a part of me missing. Sweets, crisps, and crackers are items that require a lot of effort from me to put down. I do like celery with peanut butter. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about that snack is it requires time and effort to make it where I can instantly open up sweets and start eating them.  
  
Dieting is something I have done in the past before. Twice I dropped carbs besides whole wheat bread for three weeks. I lost significant weight both times. It was necessary for me to diet at the time because I was obese and had a fatty liver. After dieting I was able to shed enough weight to the point of not being obese anymore.  
  
Much harder than putting down junk food is getting off of my computer or phone. Part of me thinks it is worth it to be on my computer because I can learn so much. However, if I continue to learn things and not apply my knowledge then it becomes useless. I hope I can gain the strength to take action and pursue my goals. I think this diary is helping, even if it is just a little bit.

I‚Äôm a 28F who‚Äôs found myself with a crush on my wayyy older friend! There‚Äôs more detail in a recent post of mine for those who want the story, but that‚Äôs the gist. It‚Äôs crazy cos I don‚Äôt have ‚Äúa thing‚Äù for older guys at ALL, just for HIM. I wanna hear you guys's thoughts on some stuff!

First, I really like this guy, but I know the stereotype: that it‚Äôs all about money for the younger woman and sex for the older dude. Is there any way to flirt while making it so clear that I care SO much about him, and NOT his money? It‚Äôs selfish, too, cos if I flirt with ‚ÄúI want to make you your coffee and cuddle‚Äù intentions, and he flirts back with FWB intentions, I‚Äôd be so heartbroken tbhhh, especially to find it out the hard way üò£

Second, he never texts first, or asks me to hang out! I‚Äôm always the one reaching out, making plans. That‚Äôs a sign someone‚Äôs just not that into you, I know that, I‚Äôm not dumb. But everything else would make me think differently, random compliments, casual touching, I‚Äôd SO think he was flirting if I wasn‚Äôt second-guessing myself so much. Think the mixed messages might be interest plus being afraid of being a creep, or am I delusional? ü§£

I'm up for any and all advice! Also to answer questions!

A psychologist and psychometrist were present for most appointments. One session was just with the psychometrist. They administered a test using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.

The psychologist was the only examiner listed in the final report. However, the psychometrist was referred to as the examiner without mentioning their name. During the session where only the psychometrist was present, this was recorded: ""The examiner observed his attention to be very good throughout the assessment, but Mr. _ remarked that his Concerta was ""wearing off"" and his
""attention was waning.""

Given that the examiner referred to above is not listed on the report, I feel this is very misleading. How can the examiner be the psychologist when they aren't in the room? Did the psychologist falsely document themself as the sole examiner? They signed the report, and I paid for it in full (they would not release it until I did).

Furthermore, the report includes a significant number of inaccuracies and grammatical mistakes. For instance, the report discussed how being right-handed and left-eye dominant affects my life. I'm left-handed... I paid over $10,000 for the examination and report.

When I emailed the psychologist about inaccuracies in the report, they dismissed my concerns as insignificant. I am considering bringing this to the College of Psychologists for review. What are your thoughts?

*Edit:
I'm frustrated because the report suggests the inaccurate data collection originated with the psychologist.

It states:  
‚ÄúThe final observation from testing noted Mr. _____‚Äôs perceived difficulty with attention approximately halfway through the session. While the examiner observed his attention to be very good throughout the assessment, Mr. _____ mentioned that his Concerta was 'wearing off' and that his 'attention was waning.' In response to this reported decrease in attention, Mr. _____ made himself two coffees in the waiting room and quickly consumed both before resuming the testing. After that, he made no further comments regarding his attention following the consumption of caffeinated beverages.‚Äù

This is not what happened. During the break, the psychometrist asked me if I wanted coffee. I said, ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù and went to get some. Since I had forgotten my water in the car, I filled another cup with water. When I returned, with a coffee in one hand and water in the other, the psychometrist said, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre double-fisting!‚Äù 

I brushed it off at the time. I had no idea that the event would be inaccurately recorded. The psychologist wasn‚Äôt there. It matters to me that the psychometrist who made those comments and inaccurately recorded the event does not identify themself as the psychologist.",1,1737596150.0,ClinicalPsychology,10,0.67,False

We were both going through something in previous relationships so we decided to just be friends since we got along so well. We talk almost every day and she tells me how much she misses me since she had to move locations, which is pretty normal for a friendship. One night she called me saying she was bored (I‚Äôm pretty sure her boyfriend wasn‚Äôt home) we talked for hours about things we had in common. Everytime I see her and we talk she maintains eye contact for extended periods of time and keeps a big smile on her face, when we first met she said that I make her so happy and I assume that‚Äôs why? Is she still flirting with me or am I interpreting things wrong? I have a lot of love and respect for her and I would hate to come in between her relationship, I was thinking about bringing it up to her but I don‚Äôt want it to be weird if she‚Äôs not actually flirting.",1,1737595641.0,dating_advice,1,0.67,False

My then gf was quite heavily into smoking b\*ngs & one day when she had none and I was working she took her rage out on my mother (73 with Parkinson's, hence why she needed to move over here with me, knowing her health was declining)  
This rage consisted of hitting my mum and leaving her like a turtle on her back on a smashed coffee table, thankfully she was able to call our carer friend that had been minding her occasionally. She took her to the police station & filed a report.

Once I got back I quit my job, grabbed mum & we moved to a rental out near our block. Several times the ex came appeared out of no where and harassed us but I moved on and we both made it through covid and im thankful that i had 110 days with mum and I just living and me not working. Moving forward 2 years mum passed away and i was left with her entire estate (which all fit in a 40ft container).

Now 5 years later I've been living off grid on my land, the ex hasn't been seen in like 3 years.  
The only issue is that because when we bought it mum wanted to be sure after she died, my family or others couldn't take it so she said, don't put her name on the deed, put our names down. Which at the time seemed like no biggie. That right there was the biggest mistake of my life.

Now my new family and I want to finish what I have started, turning the land into a camping property & build a house of our own.

I only work 4 days a week and income is limited so lawyers terrify me, I've tried hundreds of times to reconcile with the evil ex to come to an agreed price I could have paid her but she will not settle she wants 50% of what its worth now, even though when she left and we separated the land was in a horrific state with thousands worth of rubbish & leftover crap. Since then I've made it amazing. which has always felt like a bad idea because any value is now in her court.

I'm not sure what to do, lawyers could take half of what i have to pay out to her and she's also sitting waiting for me to take her to court to settle (probably watching the property area values go up rubbing her hands together). Lawyers fees for this kind of thing starts at about $2000.

Again, she paid $0, and has since paid $0 on any rates or taxes to do with it.

What would you suggest?  
Legal aid don't work for property disputes and mediation I'm not sure about but could be a go-er.

Thanks in advance for any advice.",0,1737594111.0,AusPropertyChat,1,0.5,False

One ketamine therapist told me bluntly that her patients ""don't like homework.""  So I will soon be providing sample practices  that can be easily memorized, a few key steps and practices and that's it!\]

**SAMPLE PRACTICES**

*‚ÄúThe goal of practice is always to keep our beginner‚Äôs mind.‚Äù* ‚Äì Shunryu Suzuki

The previous chapters describe a multitude of yogic practices. If you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed, don‚Äôt worry! You are encouraged ‚Äì given explicit permission ‚Äì to mix and match practices, to alter and simplify them to suit your goals and needs. Here are tenets for creating your YKS practice:

1. The spirit of the practice is the important thing, rather than the specific framing of the instructions. Seek to understand the deep purpose of a practice.
2. Mix and match practices to your heart‚Äôs delight! There are only a few essential elements, such as the mnemonic pranayama conducted at the peak.
3. Alter practices to make them more personal or suit your specific goals. There are only a few aspects that should always occur, such as the retention of the final exhalation at the end of the mnemonic pranayama.
4. Try for the perfect balance of ease and effort. You want a combination of practices that is doable, that arouses your motivation and doesn‚Äôt dissuade you with its sheer complexity or difficulty. You also want to be challenged, since that will improve your learning capacity.

Here are elements that should appear in *any* personal YKS practice:

1. *At least one exercise that applies to the body.*
2. *At least one exercise that applies to the breath.*
3. *At least one practice aimed at awareness of thoughts and feelings.*
4. *At least one practice aimed at the relationship between thoughts and feelings.*
5. *A mnemonic pranayama practice for the peak.*
6. *At least one waking-state practice geared toward integration after the ketamineexperience.*

The following are sample practices. Each begins with a description of a person, the obstacles of their life and their goals. The practice is designed specifically for their needs. You can start with any of these. It‚Äôs a great idea to tweak and adjust the practice to make it more personal, and to keep it fresh and challenging.

***Aziz:*** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 25 years old, and can‚Äôt believe I wound up in this spot. Right now I‚Äôm unemployed, and finding it hard to generate motivation for anything. I‚Äôd like to find a good job, and lose maybe 80 pounds. I have noticed that I‚Äôm constantly telling myself I‚Äôll never have *any* motivation, that my energy levels will *always* be so low I can barely get out of bed. I‚Äôm definitely depressed, though I think I‚Äôve been this way for such a portion of my life I can‚Äôt really imagine what it‚Äôs like *not* being depressed.‚Äù

***Aziz‚Äôs YKS practice:***

1. Set an intention, to find love for myself to support me in losing weight and finding work. I‚Äôll make sure to emphasize that the primary goal is self love, since I think that plugs into everything else.
2. Three rounds of cat-cow, breathing as deeply as I can and really contracting my stomach muscles to empty my lungs at the bottom. I‚Äôll cultivate joyful effort here because one, the practice actually does feel good and two, I‚Äôve always told myself I hate yoga! I‚Äôll do another round of cat-cow, and maybe a third, until I break a sweat.
3. Lie on my back and practice yoga nidra. I have a lower back issue ‚Äì probably related to my weight and lack of exercise ‚Äì so I‚Äôll raise my knees to make my lower back more comfortable. When I‚Äôm done I‚Äôll spend a few minutes breathing into the heart chakra and settle into the stomach chakra, feeling a sense of relaxation and pride (which I almost never feel these days!).
4. Practice my mnemonic pranayama, which I designed! It consists of 6 rapid, deep inhalations. I‚Äôll practice *hearing* them in two groups of three ‚Äì ‚Äú1, 2, 3,‚Äù then, ‚Äú4, 5, 6.‚Äù I‚Äôll make a ‚Äússshhhhh‚Äù sound when I‚Äôm releasing the final exhalation, with the energy of soothing a baby. I may think of my little nephew at this point. I‚Äôll practice retaining the exhalation at the bottom, and really cultivate joyful effort here, since (I tell myself) I don‚Äôt like being uncomfortable!
5. When I‚Äôm preparing for sleep, I‚Äôll recline in bed ‚Äì at an angle, supported by pillows, so I don‚Äôt inadvertently drift off to sleep ‚Äì I‚Äôll combine a retrospective memory practice and Maitri. When I remember a specific event from the day, I‚Äôll imagine my role and how I felt ‚Äì and then love myself in all my bumbling ineptitude! Every time I connect with the feeling of self love, I‚Äôll take a deep breath from the belly and follow it all the way out with a, ‚Äússshhhhhh‚Äù sound.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll practice all of these most days. On the few days I have social responsibilities or a job lead to pursue, I‚Äôll stick with (2) and (3).

‚ÄúAt my ketamine session, I‚Äôll perform (1) through (3) before the injection ‚Äì I told my doctor and she‚Äôs supportive! The chair is comfortable and I‚Äôll set it to a position midway between upright and reclining. On the come-up (which is rapid when the medicine is injected), I‚Äôll breathe deeply and generate self-love with a, ‚Äússshhhhh,‚Äù almost like (5). I‚Äôll picture my nephew and all the other kids in my life ‚Äì I love kids! ‚Äì and remind myself that my healing path benefits them too. I‚Äôll practice my mnemonic pranayama ‚Äì hearing the rhythm of my breath, with the loving feeling in my heart ‚Äì as soon as I feel the effects growing stronger. I‚Äôll be ready to find and release the self-sabotaging habits of my ego when they manifest on the come-down.‚Äù

***Briana:*** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 38. I have a demanding job, and two small children, ages 4 and 7. I am very effective in managing myself, and I‚Äôm almost famous for this among my acquaintances. But I suffer from anxiety and obsessive thoughts, non-stop. I can‚Äôt stop worrying about what might go wrong, and this stressful energy causes me occasionally to lose it in social situations. When this happens, and I yell at somebody or start crying, everyone is shocked because I normally keep it together so well. Then I spend days thinking ‚Äì on repeat ‚Äì that I‚Äôm a failure at my job and as a parent.‚Äù

***Briana‚Äôs YKS practice:***

1. First thing in the morning, set an intention. I want to lower the level of worry and stress in my life. Simple ‚Äì I want to do that, and I intend to accomplish it. I‚Äôll feel the intention at my heart center.
2. Do my usual morning asana routine. But I‚Äôll make this practice ‚Äì which I‚Äôve done everyday for the past five years ‚Äì feel brand new by focusing on a specific chakra with each asana. For example, when I‚Äôm in Warrior Two, I‚Äôll generate a sturdy feeling in the stomach, and when I‚Äôm in Wheel, I‚Äôll focus on the opening of my heart.
3. On the train in the morning, I‚Äôll practice Tonglen. I‚Äôll glance at the face of a fellow passenger, imagine their hardships, feel their pain with my inhalation, and send relief as I breathe out. This will create a good mood and smooth flow of energy ‚Äì I‚Äôll notice the feelings in my body when I arrive at work.
4. Practice the foundational practices from dream yoga. Not only will I follow the observation of things and emotions with a sense of *‚ÄúI‚Äù* at the center, but I‚Äôll make sure to take a deep breath and pause at the bottom to feel the sense of relaxation.
5. Work on my mnemonic pranayama. I‚Äôll set up the music track with the refrain that brings me so much joy. As the music swells, I‚Äôll inhale deeply along with the rhythm, and at the peak of the refrain, I‚Äôll let everything go. Retaining the exhalation at the bottom, I‚Äôll put my hands in Venus Mudra and bring attention to the way my fingers feel.
6. Practice yoga nidra in bed. I‚Äôll cycle a few times, since I often have a hard time falling asleep right away. Each time I land at the heart center, I‚Äôll evoke a memory of something that happened during the day that *might* have made me lose it. I‚Äôll hold the painful energy for a moment, noticing it in the central chakras, and release it with a long sigh.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll practice (1), (2), (3), and (6) everyday. Each time I‚Äôll make a small tweak, to keep it fresh and challenging. (4) I‚Äôll do when taking the kids to the park on the weekend, maybe when I take my bubble bath Sunday. (5) I‚Äôll practice when the kids are at their friends‚Äô or Grandma‚Äôs house, or in the car if I arrive early to pick them up from afterschool and have to wait.

‚ÄúAt my ketamine session, I‚Äôll have done my asana practice and meditated that morning. I‚Äôll discuss my intention with the doctor, the nurses, anyone who will listen ‚Äì and I‚Äôll state it to myself as soon as I sit down in the chair. After the injection, I‚Äôll breathe deeply and keep returning to the sense of *‚ÄúI‚Äù* at my heart center. When the music catches my attention (because it suddenly sounds *strange!*), I‚Äôll begin the mnemonic pranayama. I‚Äôll be ready to practice during the come-down phase. I‚Äôll let those thoughts of worry arise ‚Äì like they always do! ‚Äì and notice how they have no emotional energy behind them. I‚Äôll breathe them out, saying, ‚ÄúLet that thought go ‚Äì I‚Äôll be fine. When I return home, big hugs for the kids!‚Äù

***Charlie:*** ‚ÄúI lift weights, that‚Äôs basically all I do. Well I have a day job, but it bums me out and I wish I didn‚Äôt have to do it. If I‚Äôm not working or lifting at the gym ‚Äì and sometimes when I‚Äôm supposedly doing these things ‚Äì I‚Äôm scrolling through social media. I don‚Äôt know why, it always leaves me feeling kind of empty and a little stressed. Maybe it‚Äôs an addiction. I don‚Äôt have much of a social life, and that bums me out too. I just feel incredibly *stuck*.‚Äù

***Charlie‚Äôs YKS practice:***

1. State my intention when I take the first sip of coffee that day. The focus is discovering my own energy and creativity, so it doesn‚Äôt seem like weights and social media is all I can do.
2. Practice my Wim Hof technique, before breakfast. Lie on my back and take 15 deep breaths from the belly. I‚Äôve always done this before the gym, to build energy, but now I‚Äôll focus on deeply relaxing with each exhalation. When I release the final exhalation, I‚Äôll lie in savasana and scan the central chakras. I‚Äôve only recently realized my emotions ‚Äì and the stuck energy I‚Äôm trying to liberate ‚Äì reside there!
3. While I‚Äôm having breakfast, I‚Äôll set some prospective-memory targets, stuff I intend to remember later in the day. These can be things or people I expect to see at work, or a semi-unusual vehicle (an 18-wheeler?) I might pass on the drive. If I hit the target (by remembering *to remember*), I‚Äôll exclaim, ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù inside and make a mental note: These YKS methods really work!

1. Practice my mnemonic pranayama immediately after I get home from the gym. Sit up straight, take 7 deep breaths as if I was practicing Wim Hof. Hear the breaths as one whole ‚Äúsong,‚Äù so there‚Äôs no need to count. As I let go of that long, final exhalation, I‚Äôll scan my chakras ‚Äì forehead, throat, heart, belly, root ‚Äì and see how relaxed I can become.
2. In the shower, I‚Äôll cultivate joyful effort, praising myself for whatever prospective memory targets I nailed, and the mnemonic pranayama I practiced.
3. Throughout the evening and as I prepare for bed, I‚Äôll notice when the urge flares up to check social media. Every time, I‚Äôll notice the feeling in the body and breathe it out. If I still feel uncomfortable, I‚Äôll touch in with the joy and sense of progress I felt in the shower ‚Äì and I‚Äôll remind myself, I can check social media one time, for ten minutes, that‚Äôs plenty!

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs hard for me to stick with this practice, I‚Äôll become aware of the feeling of motivation right before I begin an exercise at the gym. I‚Äôll actually say to myself, *‚ÄòThis* is the feeling of motivation. I can generate it to serve my goals!‚Äô I‚Äôll try to perform all of these every day, and I‚Äôll keep switching up my prospective memory targets, as I learn how my mind works. I‚Äôll set at least one target at the gym, so I can remember to locate the feeling of motivation in my body.

‚ÄúMy ketamine sessions happen once a week, at home with lozenges. I‚Äôll go to the gym early Sunday, and perform (4) and (5) afterwards. The come-up phase lasts for a while with lozenges. I plan to breathe deeply, remembering the successful prospective memory targets I hit during the week, and building motivation to notice when my ordinary mind returns after the peak. I‚Äôll feel so much energy approaching the peak, my mnemonic pranayama will *just happen!* I‚Äôm excited to try releasing habitual urges, like my social media addiction, during the come-down phase.‚Äù

***Donna: ‚Äú***I used to be an artist, a fairly successful one ‚Äì Those are some of my paintings in the hallway. But I‚Äôve been stuck for a while. I just can‚Äôt get inspired and if I do feel the desire to draw something, it doesn‚Äôt happen because I‚Äôm convinced it will turn out lackluster. I‚Äôm approaching 70, and maybe I retired too young. On the other hand, I have a chronic illness that makes it uncomfortable to move around too much, so my old job wouldn‚Äôt be possible. But I feel bored, stagnant, stuck.‚Äù

***Donna‚Äôs YKS practice:***

1. Set my intention! I‚Äôll do this first thing in the morning, and right before I conduct any of the practices. I want to get the *art flowing again!* I don‚Äôt only mean paintings, though that would be nice. I used to feel a creative force carrying me through life, but it‚Äôs been many years.
2. Practice Maitri. I learned something like this a long time ago, and I remember it being so comforting. I‚Äôll focus on my breathing and the feeling in my heart center, as I cultivate love and acceptance. Every time I breathe in, I‚Äôll think, ‚ÄúLove,‚Äù and with every exhale, I‚Äôll say to myself, ‚ÄúAcceptance.‚Äù
3. I‚Äôll practice with my chakras. I‚Äôll lie on my back or put my legs up the wall in Viparita Karani, if I don‚Äôt feel too stiff. I‚Äôll focus on the stillness at my brow, the silence at my throat, and the spaciousness at my heart ‚Äì as I breathe deeply and relax.
4. Before and after I practice my mnemonic pranayama, I‚Äôll go on an imaginative journey! I‚Äôll visualize flying up out of my body and gliding over the Earth, noticing landscapes I can paint in the future.
5. My mnemonic pranayama has 5 deep inhalations and a long out-breath: ‚ÄúSsssss...‚Äù Sometimes when I hear myself making this sound, it strikes me as funny and sometimes ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì there‚Äôs a strong feeling of nostalgia. Either way, I‚Äôll notice the feelings in my body as I retain the exhalation at the bottom.
6. When I‚Äôm sitting in bed before going to sleep, I‚Äôll practice Tonglen. I‚Äôll focus on chronic pain, because now that I‚Äôm getting old, I know so many people suffering from it. I‚Äôll bring them into my mind, feel their pain along with them on the inhalation, and send them sweet relief as I breathe out.
7. I‚Äôll cultivate joyful effort as I straighten out my pillow (which I always do right before I fall asleep). I‚Äôll say it aloud, and try to arouse gratitude for my life. I‚Äôll bring awareness to my throat chakra and feel thankful for my imaginative flights above the trees, and for the people I visited in my Tonglen practice.

‚ÄúSince I‚Äôm retired, and am a disciplined person, I have no doubt I‚Äôll do these everyday. The overarching theme is love, and even as I describe this practice ‚Äì *my* practice ‚Äì I can feel the loving energy loosening my heart and starting my creativity flowing! If my body feels up to it, I may add asanas to the mix. I‚Äôm also going to keep working on (5), because I think I might be able to use a visual image ‚Äì that inspires me! ‚Äì as a mnemonic.

‚ÄúAt my ketamine session, I‚Äôll practice Tonglen during the come-up phase. I always see other patients coming and going, and I‚Äôm sure many of them are suffering quite a bit. I‚Äôll practice for them, and maintain awareness at my heart chakra and the last part of each exhalation. I‚Äôll be ready to practice my mnemonic pranayama near the peak, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I feel like I‚Äôm soaring into the sky, just like in my imaginations! I‚Äôm looking forward to the come- down phase, when I‚Äôll visualize myself painting, in my old studio, in my room, on the beech, up in the clouds ‚Äì wherever my imagination carries me!‚Äù

***Ester:*** ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been bouncing back and forth from anxiety to depression, for almost as long as I can remember. I have a tough, challenging career. I work many more hours than necessary, because I‚Äôm a perfectionist and want to succeed, but mainly to avoid honest encounters with my emotions. Even though I am capable and hardworking, I feel constantly like I‚Äôm failing, and I know my depressed and anxious state lowers the quality of my output. I feel so helpless. Everything in my life that I could change, I‚Äôve changed ‚Äì Every professional goal I had, I achieved. Yet I still feel like every step is a Herculean effort, and my life is dominated by emotional pain.‚Äù

***Ester‚Äôs YKS practice:***

1. I‚Äôll set my intention every morning at 6:00am, and right before I practice. I want to feel joy. It‚Äôs that simple ‚Äì a little bit of joy in my life. A little joy would go a long way.
2. I‚Äôll practice the full set of asanas described in Chapter 4. I‚Äôll pay attention to my breathing, and really try to let go at the bottom of the exhalation.
3. Sitting upright, I‚Äôll conduct the seated asanas from Chapter 5. Every time I exhale after holding the posture, I‚Äôll relax deeply and invite joy into my body-mind. As I progress with this practice, I‚Äôll focus on a specific chakra each time, and imagine joy is welling up in that place.
4. My mnemonic pranayama will be based on threes. Three deep, rapid inhalations, with the final exhalation released in three stages. The whole thing will produce an audible rhythm, and I‚Äôll repeat it three times.

‚ÄúThis is all I can manage right now, with my 70-hour work week. But I‚Äôll try to extend and grow the practice as time goes by. I‚Äôll conduct (1), (2), and (3) before work, and (4) when I get home (and before dinner). Once I see results from YKS, I‚Äôll be motivated to practice more ‚Äì and when I‚Äôm motivated, I do whatever it takes.

‚ÄúWhen I arrive at the ketamine clinic, I‚Äôll state my intention again and really try to *feel* it. I always get a rush of nervousness as the doctor is preparing, so I‚Äôll use this to bring my attention to feelings in my body. I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúJoy,‚Äù to myself and bring awareness to the sense of wide open space at my heart center. During the come-up phase, I‚Äôll perform (3), as I relax my body, build my energy, and resonate with my intention to discover joy. I‚Äôll practice my mnemonic pranayama as soon as I notice how strange things have become! I‚Äôm expecting to experience relief from anxiety and depression during the come-down, and maybe joy will make an appearance!‚Äù

***Fernanda:*** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a tough situation. My parents are old and in poor health, and I‚Äôm the only one available to take care of them. It consumes more and more of my life. It‚Äôs particularly difficult because they need care on a schedule, but my job has very irregular hours. I‚Äôve had to call in sick a few times, in order to deal with my parents‚Äô emergencies, and now I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll be demoted or fired. To top it off, my friend died a few months ago, and my aunt who was helping with my mom and dad is now terminally ill. According to the doctors, she doesn‚Äôt have long. I think the whole situation is worsened by my mental state. I think I may be severely depressed, but I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs depression and what‚Äôs just my life.‚Äù

***Fernanda‚Äôs YKS practice:***

1. My intention is to feel grateful for what I have, and empowered to rise to the challenges in my life right now.
2. I‚Äôll do the asanas from Chapter 4, plus a few other one‚Äôs I‚Äôve learned, like Downward Dog. I always liked the way yoga made me feel. When I practice these, I‚Äôll remind myself that I‚Äôm doing them for myself, for my loved ones, and for the world. I think this will be helpful, because even though I‚Äôm doing stuff for my parents constantly, my usual emotion is somewhere between resignation and resentment. And I *never* think about myself ‚Äì Or if I do, it‚Äôs just about how bad I feel.
3. Perform the foundational practices of dream yoga. I‚Äôll notice objects and keep returning to the sense of *witnessing*, and ‚ÄúI‚Äù at my heart center. I did a practice like this, focused on observation, when I was in art school all those years ago. I‚Äôm excited to try this new spiritual twist.
4. Meditation. My friends and one of my doctors keep mentioning this. Now that it is *aimed at a goal* I think I can actually do it! I‚Äôm going to notice my out-breath at the forehead, the throat, and the heart ‚Äì and each time I exhale, I‚Äôll let go of all the tension in my body.
5. My mnemonic pranayama will be very simple. Four deep breaths, followed by a delicious, relaxing exhalation that takes forever. Maybe because I used to play trombone, I can extend my exhale for a long time. At the bottom, as I retain the exhalation, I‚Äôll touch in with love ‚Äì I know it‚Äôs down there, because I feel it from time to time, but life has been so hectic lately the love energy seems dormant.
6. Tonglen before bed will support my sleep quality. I‚Äôll focus on my parents of course, but I‚Äôll spend time with other people in my position, people who are forced to be around-the- clock caretakers. There are so many emotions to notice in the body, and release with the exhalation as I send out love and relief. Frustration, even anger, helplessness, despair, physical discomfort, boredom, the list goes on and on. I‚Äôm curious if I can locate all these in my body, and if they‚Äôll all manifest in distinct ways.
7. Cultivate joyful effort! I can do this. I will pat myself on the back anytime I do something for somebody else *and* when I do something for me.

‚ÄúI will be able to do these on a regular basis. Maybe I can play around with my mnemonic pranayama ‚Äì For the meantime I‚Äôll keep it simple, since I‚Äôve never done anything like this before. I‚Äôm worried about (4) because the only time I attempted meditation, when I was in my 20‚Äôs, it was a fail! Though I understand now that labeling something like this a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù is neither fair nor helpful. If I struggle with it, I‚Äôll shorten the session or tweak the practice to make it more personal. (6) has me worried I‚Äôll fall asleep in the middle of the practice ‚Äì I‚Äôm usually so exhausted by the end of the day! But I‚Äôll sit upright ‚Äì that‚Äôll help ‚Äì and if need be, I‚Äôll do some energetic breathing beforehand. Or I might start to cry, thinking about my parents ‚Äì But that will be a healthy release of emotion, because nowadays whenever I imagine my parents, I feel stress and a tinge of anger.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing ketamine therapy at home with lozenges. I‚Äôll practice (1), (2), and (4) before I take the first one. Right after I put the first lozenge under my tongue, I‚Äôll conduct the dream-yoga practice, looking around the room. And as I return to *‚ÄúI,‚Äù* the witness, I‚Äôll invite a feeling of love into my heart center. I‚Äôm excited for the peak ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know what to expect, and fear I may not be able to carry out the mnemonic pranayama. But I know what to do during the come-down phase! I‚Äôll repeat the Tonglen practice, breathe out so slow and relaxed, as I send love and healing to anyone who pops into my mind ‚Äì *and myself too.*‚Äù",3,1737593643.0,KetamineStateYoga,0,1.0,False

1i7r4bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1i7r4bv/aita_for_ending_a_friendship/,AITA for ending a friendship,"Am I the asshole for wanting to end a friendship that never felt genuine and like I‚Äôm being used. 

Ever have friends that you only hangout with in groups and met through a closer friend? That‚Äôs basically this person and I was oddly included in her bridal party. Let‚Äôs call the friend I no longer want to be friends with Friend X and the friend I am still extremely close with and met Friend X through Friend A. 

Friend X has always been a standoffish person but I willingly went to parties with Friend A to celebrate their birthday, buying them gifts, decorations and paying for the stuff they wanted to do. This all started about 7 years ago during University and I would only really see X during these occasions, and holidays like st.pattys, galentines, etc but in small or large group settings. Many times it seemed like she wanted to come to mine and friend As parties just to post stories and have something to do. And while I participated in her birthdays she would often not come to mine or help pay for anything. It felt awkward going to hers and not gifting her something and I was always demanded by her friends to pay. X and I never hung out one on one for 5 years, until she got engaged and also ended a relationship with her best friend who was supposed to be her maid of honour. 

During this time I also moved within 20 minutes of friend X, so we sometimes went for coffee or brunch, nothing over 2 hours and conversations were very surface level. About 6 months after her engagement she asked me to be in her wedding party which felt very odd and as if I was filling a spot for her previous friend. Especially since she openly mentioned she wanted an even number of bridesmaids. Friend A, was also apart of the wedding party, but 10 months before the wedding X tried to kick her out of the wedding because she hadn‚Äôt gone to pick her bridesmaid dress (which could be purchased instantly with no waiting period and did not require alterations). Despite 2 other bridesmaids also not having their dress, A was still interrogated and asked to prove her loyalty to stay in the wedding. In that moment I wanted out, it was a horrible thing to do and things were getting expensive. In the end we both stayed and wanted to leave but already had paid 2000$ to be apart of it. Multiple bridezilla moments happened and I‚Äôll spare the details but my breaking point was at the wedding. My Bf and I were told months in advance that we would have a private room in the cottage X had booked for the wedding on the property grounds. She charged us 200$ per night, all together 400$. I mentioned that it was the same price as the hotel near by but she said it would be more convenient for getting ready so I agreed. Once we got there, our room had been taken and we were told to sleep in the living room on the single pullout couch. I declined and pushed for one of the rooms, which had to also sleep another person on the floor with an air mattress. As well, before the wedding friend A and I were told that the bridesmaids would be sitting together and close by the sweetheart table, but when we looked at the chart we were seated at the very last table number in the very back corner behind a pole facing the wall with her coworkers she pitty invited. Multiple people came up to me saying this looked very personal and I had no idea if I did something or my actions of requesting a bed for 400$ resulted in a last minute change. 

During the wedding and after X did not speak to me. I gifted her money with a card and did not receive a thank you (it‚Äôs been 6 months). 2 months after the wedding she asked to hangout and I said I‚Äôve been sick and can‚Äôt do anything. She then asked if I was doing anything for Halloween and I wasn‚Äôt so I said I have no plans. In these conversations I also asked how she was doing and other questions to which she said ‚Äúgood‚Äù or a simple answer, not asking me any questions back. In December I hosted a Christmas craft night and invited her and she attended but it was very awkward and she was extremely rude to my friends. 

She did not reach out saying merry Christmas or happy new year (but I didn‚Äôt either). At the beginning of January she asked me what I was doing for my birthday and I mentioned something small at my place on a specific date. She thumbs uped my message and wished me a happy birthday 2 days later and I said thank you. 10 days later on the day of my small birthday get together she never reached out. The day after she proceeds to send me a giant paragraph saying that things have been weird and she never heard anything about my birthday and that I clearly don‚Äôt care about her. 

I responded saying that it was rude to not reach out after giving details and I need some space. She has continued to text me saying she‚Äôs sorry for the way she came at me but blah blah blah giving all these excuses. I keep saying I need some space because it‚Äôs never seemed like she‚Äôs cared about me. 

Some other details is that I am 90% she is pregnant and her only remaining friend moved 50hours away. I have a feeling she just wants someone for the baby shower and to help her with the baby. It‚Äôs never felt genuine and I‚Äôve always felt like she‚Äôs never actually cared but just wanted to use me. Her messages begging for my friendship and saying that I‚Äôm seeing everything wrong is stressing me out and I want to know if I‚Äôm the asshole. ",1,1737593478.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

1i7r1g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Otherworldpod/comments/1i7r1g0/never_ending_road/,Never Ending Road,"Loved this episode. Finally there's someone with a similar experience that my friend and I had years ago. 
When I was around 19/20, my best friend and I were hanging out at a creek in my town, it had some picnic tables and was located on a regular suburban street. We used to go there and smoke cigarettes (the good old days) drink coffee, and talk. 

It was around 8 or 9pm and we are sitting at the table when suddenly 100's of ducks come barreling out of nowhere, and are all running away from the water towards us. It was strange because i don't think i've ever seen ducks that late, and also running away from the water all at the same time. I experience a wave of fear and my friend looks at me and says ""let's go"" not realizing she was feeling the same. We book it to the car but as we are walking I see a weird light in the sky that looks like a firework.  

We get into her car and start driving around, mind you, we haven't said a word to each other since she said ""let's go"". She starts driving around and there is not one car driving on the road. After the initial panic and fear settles, I suddenly get this thought that we are dead. It's hard to describe because it was more than a thought, I was convinced we both died and that our souls were driving around like a purgatory. 

It felt like we were driving around for hours when in reality it was probably around 10 min. We both snap out of it and are able to now speak to each other. I tell her she's probably gonna think I'm nuts but I thought we'd both died. She looks at me and says  ""I thought the same exact thing"". After that we both recounted the same internal experience. For years we referred to it as ""the night"". We still talk every once in a while and it still pops up in conversation as something strange and unexplainable. I'm going to send her this episode to see what she thinks. Anyhow thanks for listening. ",35,1737593246.0,Otherworldpod,3,1.0,False

About Me:
*   Mix, Asian, 6', fit (not a frequent gym-goer, but average fit built).
*   Good-looking, cute :) Good fashion sense, clean-cut overall.
*   DDF, excellent hygiene.
*   Based in Toronto. Can host under specific conditions. Would be better if you could host.
* I have done a Masters in Engineering. Doing a full-time job in an engineering firm.
*   Respectful, laid-back, and open-minded. Your comfort always comes first.


What I'm Looking For:

I've always been drawn to curvy women but it's not a must :) I am also fine with a slim build. I love the dynamic of youth meeting wisdom and am attracted to Asians though race isn't a dealbreaker if there's chemistry. Initially seeking a one-night stand, but I'd love for it to evolve into FWB if we connect. I am good with flirting, enjoying the idea of an older woman in charge. But once things heat up, I'm confident, dominant, and bring the energy of youth to impress.

The Plan:

Let's start with a chat to see if we vibe. Then, we can meet in public (coffee or a drink on me). I love the buildup and the anticipation of getting to know someone makes the experience much more exciting. I'm not looking to use or be used; I want a connection.

* Safety First:
I prioritize safety, so I'll need to verify you're real with a picture and some basic questions. Meeting in public first is non-negotiable, and I'm open to a quick call for verification too. Looking forward to a good chat, a good drink, and hopefully a memorable night with someone who shares this fantasy. Thanks for reading this far..tell me you all time fav show when you msg so I know you read it so far.

Others saying how she was a stupid MC. And others treating her as a generic otome protagonist

My thoughts?

I'll start with her in general and move onto how she is in the other routes. I know lots of players talk about how the 'eyeless MC' of games are creepy and have no personality so it's left to the player's choice. Not only is Lili's design extremely beautiful, but she definitely speaks more for herself than most otome MC's. Compared to someone like the heroine in Amnesia who 1) doesn't have a canon name 2) doesn't have a canon personality cause, well.... memory loss, or voltage inc MC's that don't even have eyes, Liliana is certainly an upgrade! She's gorgeous and has a personality! She's kind-hearted, caring, motherly, good at cooking + cleaning, waifu material! Sure, she may seem like a generic goody-goody otome protag, but due to the fact she was a church girl in 1920's Italy, I'd say it suits her better than something like her being a cold-hearted assassin that ends up joining the mafia  in the end

Lots of ppl's main complaints abt Otome protags, aside from a lack of personality is the default 'damsel in distress' trait. Once again, considering Lili's upbringing and where/when the story is set, this didn't really bother me as much as it does with other protags such as say Ichika from CxM (girl, you're a cop ffs!). What makes Lili really stand out imo is that her personality + even her canon appearance is constantly commented upon by other players (her golden hair, her kindness, how good she is at baking, etc.). She tends to 'blend in' more with the characters in the story rather than stand out bc of 'self insert' syndrome. Even when her personality lowkey shifts depending on the route/guy (I adored her MUCH more in Yang's route than say Dante's or Nicola's), she still maintains these canon traits that make her stand out as her own character. She plays the 'damsel in distress', but it makes sense. She's naive, but it makes sense. She has the default 'good at cooking + cleaning waifu traits', but again, it makes sense! I know I keep using a character's backstory as a basis for why I can tolerate something, but once again....IT MAKES SENSE! Otome games don't have to be realistic for me to like them, but if you have an MC's who's writing makes rational sense, I won't end up hating them

Now you're probably wondering why this is titled my having mixed feelings about Lili when all I did was sing praises about her so far. Allow me to introduce the things that I happen to have issues with

1) The game doesn't really allow for 'self inserting'

\-You're probably raising your brow at this, cause this was one of the points I said that made me like Lili. But otome games either have two extremes of this. 1) Give the MC no canon appearance/personality so the player can self insert, but ends up making an unlikeable blank slate character in the process or 2)Give the MC a canon appearance/personality/and even backstory, but ends up leaving no room to self insert. The LI's canonically speak/say Lili's name if her canon name is chosen (there is literally voiced lines of them saying ""Lili""). Her having canonical blond hair in cg's was something I can tolerate, there's lots of MC's that have brown hair, and I have black hair irl. But the fact the other characters are flat out saying she had blond hair makes me feel like the player's ability to self insert through Lili is narrowed. Her being an orphan of the church is a good enough background to start with. The >!key maiden plot!<, I honestly just didn't care for it overall. Ik it serves more of a purpose depending on which route you choose, but still felt like a.....>!strange way to make the MC's special!<. The only thing that's stopping me from removing that part completely from my own piofiore mc is that Dante is my bias and I'm a sucker for the >!'destined to be'!< trope

2) The whole church upbringing/plot point

\-Being a muslim myself, I found the religious theme of piofiore to be rather....annoying? I didn't mind it, I was never really attached to Islam heavily, and some of the routes don't even have any relevance to the >!key maiden plot.!< But the routes that do, it just kinda drags. Especially when christianity in this game is treated more of a 'supernatural, greek mythology' sorta plot device. >!Like seriously...the key maiden + a Falzone has to bang in order to open the tomb of Jesus Christ?!< That's what makes the MC so special? Again, she doesn't need to be a badass assassin with a tragic past to feel more lively, but I felt as if the game could've done more with making Lili special. Some say she's 'ordinary' but I feel the people that say this just don't think about the her as the >!key maiden !<cause the subplot itself is just kinda weird 

3) Her role in different routes

\-This is more of an issue with the game itself rather than Lili, but it also affects how I saw her. Again, it's 1920's Italy, a time where Mussolini came into power and women were expected to have their duties revolve around domestic life. But c'mon!!! In Yang's, Orlok's and even Gil's route, Lili actually did something! >!She got to witness the darkness of the mafia in Yang's route, was on the run in Orlok's route, went on dates in Gil's route!<, etc. For a women during her time, Lili was pretty involved in these routes more than the Falzone's, where she was just baking and making Dante/Nicola coffee! Ik she has some develop in the sequels, even when she is with a Falzone (>!in Dante's 1926, she was learning english to becoming an asset to the family!<). But if she could use her brain in those routes, I dunno why she was done dirty in the Falzone family's routes. There can be more to an MC than just 'waifu traits', even if you're realistically limited due to the time period. Again, Otome games don't have to be realistic, just make enough sense! 

It's been a while since I touched Piofiore, so I may have forgotten some things, but I just wanted to share my thoughts about our precious Liliana! I think about her a lot more than other otome MC's, for better or for worse. It's hard finding the right balance between self insert and MC's with a personality/spine. I feel as if Lili tipped a bit much in the latter part, I didn't feel as if I could really project onto her as the player",7,1737593067.0,otomegames,6,0.82,False

I decided to 3D print a vacuum-sealed coffee jar with built-in smart scales to track how much coffee is left - meaning it can automatically order more beans before I run out.

It's kinda ugly, but it's making my morning routine a little more convenient.

They are sometimes physically abusive but most of the time its emotionally abusive. Its been going on since I was 8 yrs old and I cant take it anymore. Ive tried to commit so many times and what happened recently just really triggered me but i basically dress and do my makeup alternatively, i have a lot of piercings on my face and ears too and my parents have never liked any of it and i slowly got them to not mention it but i wore goth makeup on monday and i came home and was cooking food for myself and i heard my mom come home so i immediately wiped off my black lipstick but my face was still white and as soon as my mom saw that my cheeks were the color white, the FIRST thing she says to me is why do You look like that. Immediately i felt so horrible and i was thinking to myself ‚Äúnot this again‚Äù because its not the first time she has disliked me doing my makeup but this time it was different. She kept on saying if im trying to look like a clown and that i look bad and look like i belong in a circus. Right?.. who says this to their own daughter. I just ignored it and she didnt stop so i said ‚Äúcan you stop already‚Äù and she said ‚Äúohh now i cant even state an opinion anymore‚Äù like no dude the first thing u say to me when u come home is say that i look bad and that i look like a clown. I hate her narcissistic self so much and ive tried to forgive everyone in my family for the 9 years of physically and emotionally abusing me but im sick and tired. Theyre never gonna change. I just want a family that will love me for who i am, not one that constantly hates and judges me. And then my brother tries to be all controlling and comes into the kitchen and says ‚Äúif you dont stop doing your makeup like that, im gonna ground you‚Äù and i said ‚Äúhow is my makeup affecting how you‚Äù and he just mocked me because HES in the wrong and then the day after i had an important test so before i left for school he was like ‚Äúwhere are you going‚Äù and i said ‚Äúschool, i already told mom i have a test‚Äù and he then came in front of me and said ‚Äúwhy did you cover your face with the scarf‚Äù and i said ‚Äúbecause its cold outside‚Äù I felt really anxious because I knew something like this would happen or ruin my morning, he then tried pulling off my scarf and I was like stop and I gently pushed his hand and he yelled ‚ÄúFUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU‚Äù and forcefully pulled off my scarf off my face and neck and spilled his coffee everywhere and said ‚Äúacting like i wont let you go out‚Äù like yes dude that literally what u did. And he pushed my scarf in my hand and then pushed me out the door and i had a horrible panic attack and called 988 because i felt so horrible and had to talk to someone because i was hyperventilating super badly and the person who answered eventually made a good point that he mightve triggered me from when i was 12 when he hit me a lot and it took him 3 days to apologize and it was a half assed apology too. He kept on blaming me and apologized for pushing me and everything and i just responded that i didnt care for his excuse because his aggression was unnecessary and that he ruined my day and that i dont feel safe around him anymore and he responded to that by blaming me again so i just left him on read and yes unfortunately i have to live in the same house as him and see his face. I feel so suffocated like i cant express the stuff that i want to dress like or be and i hate it so much. Its the times that i feel the most confident too that they have to make me feel horrible. Im not sure if i want to call cps because what if they just tell my parents to get therapy and they leave me here?? I dont want that. Ill be so scared for my safety after that, they will truly dislike me for calling cps on them. Im safe right now but its because im choosing not to talk to them. I want to get adopted by a new family or move in with my boyfriend but im in new york and hes in florida.. is that even possible for me to be moved there after i get separated from my family? How do i even get separated in the first place? I have a therapist right now and I told her my whole situation but its taking a long time so I would really really appreciate any advice on how to get out of my home.‚òπÔ∏è",1,1737592889.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

\- Club? Missed the election for most interest-focused club. But stilll open to activities organized by club

\- Travelling? School-organized treks are very expensive... I dont think it is worth it. I am thinking to organize but it is not easy to find a group of people to join

\- what else...?

My focus would be soft skills and leadership skills but I found it is not easy to step out the comfort zone and test my boundery... Any suggestions on that?
