And since my contractor didn't give me a copy of ""What to Expect When You're Expecting A New Kitchen"" I'm hoping I haven't missed anything. This is what I've done to prep: 

* Obviously, cleared out all cabinets and put everything in the home office. 
* Set up sideboard with microwave, toaster and coffee maker. 
* Set up 5 gallon water dispenser 
* Set up a tall IKEA table with plastic cutlery and paper plates. 
* Ordered various ready-to-microwave meal delivery service for the next 3 weeks. 
* Took lots of before pictures. 
* Taped the wifi password to the fridge (I'm in a cell phone dead zone, so they'll need wifi to do anything) 
* Thanked the spirit of the former owner of the home for building the cabinets himself, they probably shined in their day, but they have outlived their time, and the tall cabinet still smells of beer on hot summer days since that's where he threw his empties. 

  
Anything you found particularly helpful in getting through these times?

1q34qza,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1q34qza/how_to_hack_your_brain_chemistry_and_start/,How to HACK Your Brain Chemistry and Start WINNING: The Science Behind It,"Look   most people have no clue they're walking around with a neurochemical shit show happening in their heads. You wake up feeling like garbage   can't focus for more than 5 minutes, feel unmotivated as hell   and wonder why everyone else seems to have their life together. Here's what nobody tells you: Your brain chemistry is either working for you or against you. And if you're stuck in a rut   chances are your dopamine   serotonin   and other neurotransmitters are completely out of whack. I spent months diving into research   books   podcasts   , neuroscience studies   and honestly   once I understood how this stuff actually works   everything changed. This isn't some woo woo bullshit. This is science. And it's how winners actually win.

 Step 1: Stop Destroying Your Dopamine System

Dopamine is your brain's reward chemical. It's what makes you feel motivated, focused   and driven. But here's the problem: modern life is designed to hijack your dopamine system. Social media   porn   junk food   video games all give you massive dopamine hits without you doing anything meaningful. Your brain gets lazy. It expects huge rewards for zero effort.Dr. Andrew Huberman   neuroscientist at Stanford   breaks this down perfectly on his podcast. When you flood your system with easy dopamine (scrolling TikTok for hours)   your baseline dopamine drops. You need more and more stimulation just to feel normal. That's why you can't focus. That's why starting a task feels impossible.

The fix? Dopamine fasting. Not the cringe version where you sit in a dark room. I mean cutting out the cheap hits. Delete social media apps for a week. No porn. No binge watching Netflix. Let your dopamine baseline reset. It sucks at first   but after a few days   normal activities (like working on your goals) start feeling rewarding again.Then   earn your dopamine. Do hard things. Finish a workout. Complete a task you've been avoiding. Your brain will release dopamine naturally   and it'll feel 10 times better than any Instagram scroll session ever did.

 Step 2: Get Your Serotonin Up (Without Pills)

Serotonin is your mood stabilizer. Low serotonin equals depression   anxiety   irritability. Most antidepressants work by boosting serotonin. But you don't need pills to get this right.

Sunlight is a game changer. Seriously. Getting 10 20 minutes of morning sunlight directly hitting your eyes (no sunglasses) triggers serotonin production. Huberman hammers this point home constantly. It also sets your circadian rhythm   which helps you sleep better   which creates a positive feedback loop.
Exercise is the other big one. Cardio especially. A 30 minute run can spike your serotonin levels for hours. There's a reason you feel amazing after a workout. It's not just endorphins. It's a full neurochemical cocktail working in your favor.

And weirdly enough   social connection boosts serotonin too. Even if you're an introvert. Having genuine conversations   helping someone out   feeling part of something bigger than yourself   all of that fires up your serotonin system. Isolation kills it.
If you want to go deeper on this   check out ""The Molecule of More"" by Daniel Z. Lieberman and Michael E. Long. Both are top researchers   and this book blew my mind. It explains how dopamine and other chemicals shape literally every decision you make. Insanely good read. Best neurochemistry book I've ever read. This book will make you question everything you think you know about motivation and desire.

 Step 3: Control Your Cortisol Before It Controls You

Cortisol is your stress hormone. A little bit is good. It gets you fired up   focused   ready to perform. But chronic high cortisol destroys you. It kills your memory   wrecks your sleep   makes you fat (especially around the belly)   tanks your testosterone   and keeps you anxious 24/7.
Most people are in a constant state of low grade stress. Work deadlines   notifications pinging every 2 seconds   news cycle doom scrolling   money worries. Your cortisol never gets a chance to drop.

Here's how to fix it:

 Breathing exercises. Not kidding. Box breathing (inhale 4 seconds   hold 4   exhale 4   hold 4) activates your parasympathetic nervous system and drops cortisol fast. Do this for 5 minutes when you feel stressed.Sleep. This is non negotiable. If you're getting less than 7 hours   your cortisol stays elevated all day. You'll feel wired but tired. Fix your sleep   and half your problems disappear.
 Stop drinking coffee past noon. Caffeine spikes cortisol. If you're already stressed   that extra coffee is making things worse, not better.

There's also an app called Finch that helps you build better habits through gamification and gentle reminders. It's surprisingly effective for stress management and keeping you consistent with small daily wins that compound over time.

 Step 4: Boost Your Testosterone and Estrogen Balance

Yeah   this matters for everyone   not just gym bros. Testosterone (in both men and women) is tied to confidence   drive   aggression in a good way   focus   and energy. Low testosterone equals low motivation   brain fog   weak performance.

How to boost it naturally:

 Lift heavy weights. Compound movements like squats   deadlifts   bench press. These trigger testosterone production like nothing else.
 Get enough sleep. Testosterone is produced during deep sleep. If you're sleep deprived   your levels tank.
 Cut out excessive sugar and processed carbs. These spike insulin   which suppresses testosterone.
 Zinc and magnesium supplementation. Most people are deficient. These minerals are crucial for hormone production.

For women   balancing estrogen is equally important. Too much (often from environmental toxins   plastics   processed foods) leads to mood swings   weight gain   fatigue. Eating cruciferous vegetables (broccoli   cauliflower   kale) helps your body metabolize excess estrogen.Check out ""Why We Sleep"" by Matthew Walker if you want the full science breakdown on how sleep affects literally every system in your body   including hormones. Walker is a sleep scientist at UC Berkeley   and this book is a must read if you're serious about optimizing your brain and body. Best sleep book ever written. It'll make you realize how much you've been screwing yourself over by not prioritizing rest.

 Step 5: Use Your Brain's Natural Reward System

Your brain wants to win. It's wired for it. But you've got to stack small wins to keep your neurochemistry firing in your favor. Every time you accomplish something   even something tiny   your brain releases a little dopamine. String together enough small wins   and you build momentum.james Clear talks about this extensively in his work on habit formation. His podcast and content on atomic habits are gold. The idea is simple: Make progress visible. Cross off tasks. Track your habits. Celebrate small victories. Your brain doesn't care if the win is big or small. It just cares that you're winning.

BeFreed is an AI powered personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia University that converts expert knowledge into custom audio content and adaptive learning plans. You type what you want to improve   maybe understanding brain chemistry or building better habits   and it pulls from vetted sources like research papers   expert interviews   and books to create podcasts tailored to your learning style. 

The depth customization is clutch. Start with a 10 minute summary to see if the content clicks   then switch to a 40 minute deep dive with detailed examples and context when you're ready to go all in. The voice options are genuinely addictive too. There's a deep   smooth option like Samantha from Her   plus sarcastic and energetic styles depending on your mood. During commutes or workouts   having that level of control over how you consume information makes a massive difference.

What sets it apart is the adaptive learning plan that evolves based on your specific struggles and goals. Chat with the AI coach about where you're stuck   and it builds a structured roadmap using science backed content that fits your unique situation. Made real progress understanding neurochemistry patterns and implementing actionable strategies without having to piece together dozens of podcasts and books myself.Use apps or journals to track your progress. Seeing a streak of completed days or checked off goals creates a positive feedback loop that keeps your brain chemistry working for you instead of against you.

 Step 6: Feed Your Brain the Right Fuel

Your brain is 60% fat. If you're eating like shit   your brain chemistry suffers. Omega 3 fatty acids (from fish   walnuts   flaxseeds) are crucial for brain function and mood regulation. Most people are deficient.

Protein is also key. Amino acids from protein are the building blocks of neurotransmitters. Low protein equals low dopamine   serotonin   and everything else.Cut out the processed junk. Excess sugar crashes your blood glucose   which crashes your mood and focus. You want stable energy   not spikes and crashes.

If you're serious about this   dive into ""Genius Foods"" by Max Lugavere. He's a health and science journalist who breaks down exactly what foods optimize brain chemistry and which ones destroy it. This book is a game changer for anyone wanting to eat smarter and think clearer. Best brain nutrition book out there.

   

Bottom line: Your brain chemistry dictates your life more than you realize. You want to stop feeling stuck   unmotivated   anxious   or depressed? Start treating your neurochemistry like the high performance machine it is. Reset your dopamine, boost your serotonin   manage your cortisol   balance your hormones   stack small wins   and eat right. Do this consistently   and your brain will reward you with focus   energy   , confidence   and momentum. That's how you start winning.",1,1767471038.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False
1q34pqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1q34pqs/the_last_text_he_sent_right_after_the_breakup_vs/,"The last text he sent right after the breakup, vs the one I got a few days later.","(I'll post the two texts with line breaks at the bottom. Some context first if you want to read it.)

For context, the first time he yelled at me really bad was during the initial abuse period when we moved in together, and I thought it was regular couples communication issues. He yelled at me right after he told me that I needed to go to therapy to ""work on my triggers."" I did. I talked to my therapist about my abusive ex from my past, and how yelling was a massive trigger for me. He yelled at me for the first time, right after I told him what I had spoken to my therapist about. He wasn't on prednisone the first time. He yelled at me because I asked to turn the water heater up and he was giving me alternatives to heat my bath water (which were nonsensical). I didn't say that to him. I just said that he could turn the cold knob on further... He said it would burn his hand where he has to turn the water on and off so much in the kitchen and that I didn't care about hurting his hands. I felt crazy. 

During that period he was paranoid, mean, and using coersive control. I felt like everything I did was wrong. It's fine to have some healthy conflict, but my brain was twisted into knots. I couldn't hardly bring myself to apologize because talks with him were abusive. Like, he didn't get that I was undermining myself by apologizing for his shitty behavior. I called him out on that as soon as I had a lightbulb moment about our dynamic being emotional abuse. During that talk, I said ""maybe your feelings aren't valid."" It wasn't something I'd ever say to anyone in any other context, but I needed him to shut up and quit railroading over all of my attempts to let him know that he had become abusive. I later apologized several times for saying this to him, dispite the context that I shouldn't have to be composed or perfectly word everything when he's being an abusive asshole. 

He ""changed,"" for a little bit. Or it just kind of got more sneaky? He used therapy language against me, out of context of what was actually happening. He weaponized terms out of context to suit himself. I tried to understand him to give him benefit of the doubt. He understood me and used my vulnerabilities to cut me deep. He read through my diary and then yelled at me about it??? I was tracking my thoughts and feelings because they had no where else to go. Now he's genuinely reflecting for the first time. 

I halted him moving his buisness into my house because I didn't feel emotionally safe with him. I ignored my gut feeling after 7 months when he began pressuring me heavily, and I believe his last blowup was due to that getting set back due to unforseen circumstances. I was working and paying all the bills for him to save money for his business. He only managed 3k in one year. He only worked one day per week. Yet, I was supposed to trust him and help him take out a loan so that he would feel better, dispite my feelings. He gave me an ultimatum in October that if he didn't have his buisness in by December, he was going to get an apartment to practice out of. After I paid to put him through school, and even though I was struggling with bills due to his stupidity? If he had worked and saved, AND never abused me, neither of us would have suffered?

He went on a Facebook tirade making posts about narcissistic abuse right after going back home. Or things about avoidantly attached people running away... I endured so much that he will never understand. I strongly suspected NPD because of his family history and I was still willing to stay although it was breaking my brain. 

I want to believe it's all true, but I can't trust it. I wish he would do better for himself and his next partner, but I have a hard time trusting it. It's so heartbreaking because there was also a lot of good in him that I don't think was manufactured or to manipulate me. 

I was trying to take a break away from him. My therapist literally said ""I can't tell you what to do, but if it were me, I would get him out of the house."" It was a wakeup call because I had been hiding things from her and blaming my moods on my ptsd until I snapped awake and couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't unsee him for what he was doing to my head. 

-------------------------------‐-------------------------

""I understand and respect that youre in a great deal of pain. I do. But from my perspective, it seems self inflicted. I cant take your abuse any longer [my name]. If you cant see how you've hurt me repeatedly, I will gladly walk away and never look back. And this isnt what I wanted either [my name]. I wanted my sweet Angel. I wanted  a partner that would be just as supportive towards me, as I am of them. I wanted team work and partnership. I wanted to hold you close to me every day and night. Reassure you that everything would be ok. Give you gentle kisses and massages. I thought you were the one. I saw a future with you that looked heavenly to me. I told you the ONLY way I would walk away from you is if you told me to. And thats what im hearing from you now. I can respect the space you are asking for and needing. But i will not willingly be downgraded in this relationship. I do not let my friends tolerate treating me the way you do. You had a pass. One that im revoking right now. So if you feel the need to downgrade me from Fiancé to friend. Ill do you one better and erase you from my memories. Because I respect myself too much to suffer, and watch you show up for other people in ways you couldn't show up for me. I cant force you to grow or heal as a person. I showed up for you. 

And if you want to know how I KNOW this was abuse. My mom started BAWLING when I told her that I got off of my prednisone to try and appease you. That medication makes me WAY more irritable than I normally am otherwise. And you told me that was an excuse, that I was justifying my anger. I was willing to let my health decline just to try and make you happy. And you belittled me for it.. 

Have a good life [my name]. Be good 💔"" 


--------------------------------------------------------

""[my name].
I was going to ask you if you felt comfortable grabbing coffee sometime in the future for better closure. I know I've already hurt you too much for you to ever want that in the near future. Ive been praying a lot since we ive moved back. I wanted to share my feelings that I found.

No matter how much I may have been feeling hurt, or thought that I was trying to reach you; I had no right to weaponize my anger against you in the moments I felt distressed. After our first big conflict last year I should have immediately started going to therapy when you did. I even knew that back then. I honestly felt immobilized, truly. When my body becomes activated like that, i get depressed and time passes differently. The days blur together and surviving feels like a struggle.  I know neither of us were intentionally trying to hurt one another. I know you weren't being neglectful, you were just struggling too. And I took that personally by mistake. I was also struggling at the beginning, and i think i was coming to you for help, and i never meant for it to come across as critical. When I triggered you early on, and you told me my feelings or emotions didn't matter, I know you
 didn't mean that, that you were responding to my demand for validation in that moment because mine felt so loud. Even so I think it cut me mentally in a way that it stuck with me, and it skewed the way I saw interactions after that... I really should have been in therapy before. I really did feel shut down, and a twinge resentful about postponing the business. (Not that I should have felt that way)
 I feel like I can be infinitely flexible to options, but mostly when there are clear and defined expectations or deadlines. Ambiguity and indirectness feels threatening to me. Which is why your last text felt triggering. When you said ""Sorry you're feeling bad"" I didn't feel seen. (Which is stupid) In my mind, I wasn't just feeling bad, you were the one making me feel bad by asking me to move in with [His abusive brother's name] after the fire. I had been making you miserable, so i dont blame you. 


I felt like I was able to see and acknowledge my part in this, how my tone was never appropriate, I never wanted you to think that i believed it was. Ive said as much this whole time that I felt guilty of my tone. I was stupidly trying to communicate my feelings during times I was flooded. Im sorry I ever made you feel guilty about that. I feel a lot of guilt after we fight and i didnt always know how to reengage the connection. When im triggered and defensive I felt like I needed to feel seen by you. But its unfair to ask you to give vulnerability to me if I couldn't contain my triggers or give vulnerability to you. Im terribly sorry for how I've behaved... these past few days of rest and feeling detached from the stress has allowed me to feel and see more than just my own hurt. I apologize for not seeing it then, and Im sorry that I allowed my hurt to bleed out. My past hasn't been
 kind to me. Im hoping my words will set free the pain I caused, but I know only time can do that.

I really didn't mean to use the fact I was on prednisone as an excuse. It really does make it harder on me, but I wont justify my poor actions. I also am understanding the Adderall was making me paranoid, and thats another thing im going to let go of.

I never meant to be controlling either. I honestly just wanted collaboration and not controll. Before and during the move, it felt as if my wants in decision making weren't being taken into consideration. Which really only ever bothered me on decisions that affected me directly. There were times we'd come to a consensus, and then the plans would change without my knowing. Thats something i should have had better communication skills to express. And not allowed my upset to sit. 

You really did show up, and pour so much in to me. I didn't want you to walk away feeling bitter, resentment or think that I just think youre crazy. I know youre not. Ive been a real asshole to you and im sorry. 

When I ended things the other day,  I was still in my triggered space. I felt I heard more ambiguity in your words which felt like a soft rejection. A way to ask for space so the impending seperation would be easier. I should have trusted your words more, and i want to apologize for that as well. I can see now that ambiguity was more of a favor to me, because everything in you was telling you to leave me, but you were still leaving the door open. The thought of being moved into the house i was abused in, and becoming just friends with the person who was my whole world felt overwhelming to me. Still does tbh.. 

None of of your actions warranted my reactions. I know that, and I kept pushing for you to validate how I perceived your actions. Ive got therapy appointments for my self every week for the next 3 weeks, all different therapists. And going to schedule more from there. Ill be working at the [new place of work] full time. Going to the Y weekly. Im afraid ive done too much harm between us, and that you would never feel safe with me again, so Im going to stay single for awhile and work on myself and try to grow. I was still wanting to pay you back for all that you poured in to me. And if it's ok I would like to set up a way for me to pay directly on the debts you took out on for me.
Thankyou for taking me in as long as you did,  and being my best friend for as long as you were. I dont hold any anger or resentment towards you. You've done nothing to warrant those feelings from me. I just want you to be happy and healthy too. Ill always have boundless love for you in my heart [my name].

Over the past few weeks, a lot of people reached out about wanting community and connection in IC. I took a little time to organize things so it feels welcoming, safe and easy to join - and now it is here.

Once you’re in your mid-20s, 30s, or early 40s, making friends can feel surprisingly hard. You’re not in school anymore, routines take over, and even when there are things happening, it’s easy to think “I don’t really know anyone” or “I don’t even know where to start” — so we stay in, get tired, and the comfort zone slowly shrinks.

That’s where IC Gathering Circle comes in. A Space to bringing people together through everyday activities and shared interests and make it easier for us to meet people, spend time together and make friends

This community its a way to help us step a little and get to know each other outside our routines and share what we like.

Some of the things we’ll be doing: 
✨ game nights & board games

✨ crafts, DIY, and themed activities

✨ cooking & baking together

✨ winter walks or gym buddies

✨ study or read-together time

✨ coffee meetups and conversations

✨ sharing events happening around town


And if there’s something you’d love to do and don’t see listed — bring it up. This community grows from all of us.

If this year feels like a new chapter — a new me, new us, new connections kind of year — you’re very welcome here. Even if all you want right now is to meet people, start somewhere, or simply feel less alone, that’s enough.

♡ Join here:

Now I am okay with a 50/50 split on bills but I've noticed my bf asks me to zelle him back for things like a $6 coffee. So we go out he puts his card down then asks me to Zelle him back and counts things like a little coffee, a little muffin. He never buys me flowers only gotten me flowers once in 7 months of being together and that was on my birthday. Everything else besides the financial aspect is great between us. 

  
So I brought this up and essentially said I am ok with the 50 50 model we have but I need to feel like you can sometimes treat me to drinks here and there or coffee here and there without asking me to zelle you back and trust that I will return this gesture and do the same for you without counting every penny. I also said it's important for me to feel like my partner gets me flowers and does small gestures and his response is what would you do for me in return. I'm really having a hard time with this convo. We agreed to stop the Zell system and take turns paying when we go out but I'm left feeling like we do not agree on a core value and his response to me bringing this up was extremely defensive and rigid. 

I am not asking for him to be a provider but I am asking for more softness around money where a small coffee or one date night can be on him without tallying everything and these acts of generosity will be reciprocated but it seems like he cannot do anything if there is no promise of something in return and I am not sure what to do with this information. This is someone I envision a future with and I am devastated. Would appreciate advice ",1,1767470680.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1q34e9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1q34e9t/chapter_one_the_last_lecture/,Chapter One: The last lecture,"
The classroom smelled faintly of chalk and dust, though the board had long been replaced by a projector screen. Afternoon light streamed through tall windows, catching the worn edges of desks that had carried generations of restless students. On this day, the air was different—looser, freer. The final lecture had just ended.
Students lingered in groups, their laughter bouncing off the walls. Some snapped photos, others scribbled farewell messages on notebook covers or shared plans for the evening. The professor, who had spoken with more sentiment than usual, had left the room with a wave and a reminder to “make your knowledge count beyond grades.”
Amina sat quietly near the middle, her notebook closed, her pen resting neatly across the margin. She wasn’t one to scribble goodbyes or chase photographs. Her heart beat with the strange weight of finality. Four years of notes, four years of exams, four years of sitting beside the same person.
Across the desk, Daniel was still scribbling something. Of course he was. He always wrote fast, his pen moving as if afraid the words might escape if he didn’t trap them quickly enough. His brows were furrowed, lips pressed in concentration—a look she had memorized as faithfully as formulas and definitions.
She watched him for a second too long before catching herself. “Done already?” he asked without looking up, noticing her closed notebook.
“I’ve been done,” she said, her tone light. “You just like making everything perfect.”
He finally looked at her, grinning. “Perfection gets you first-class honors. Remember that.”
She shook her head, pretending to roll her eyes. But she knew the truth: without his relentless drive, she might not have come this far. Without him, her nights would have been lonelier, her questions heavier. He had been—without ever knowing it—the anchor that steadied her.
Around them, classmates were packing, laughing, making noisy plans for celebratory dinners. Lydia, the loudest voice in their year, leaned over their desk. “Hey, you two. Still pretending all you do is study?”
Amina felt her cheeks warm. Daniel just chuckled. “That’s all we do, Lydia. Some of us had to actually work for our grades.”
Lydia rolled her eyes dramatically. “Well, you’ll miss each other when this is over. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.” She swirled away, her laughter trailing behind.
Daniel shook his head, amused. “She thinks everything is a soap opera.”
Amina smiled faintly, but the words stung more than they should have. Because to her, it wasn’t a soap opera. It was something she carried in silence, day after day.
They packed their bags in companionable quiet, the kind that came from years of sitting together without needing to fill every second with words. The room slowly emptied until only a few stragglers remained.
“Hard to believe it’s over,” Daniel said finally, standing and swinging his bag across his shoulder.
“Not over,” Amina replied, rising too. “Just… changing.”
He gave her one of those smiles that unsettled her more than she dared admit—warm, open, unguarded. A smile that could mean everything or nothing at all.
They walked into the corridor together, their footsteps echoing side by side. Amina glanced around, taking in every detail: the peeling noticeboard, the rows of lockers dented with time, the faint hum of conversations that had once been background noise but now felt like fading music.
“You know,” Daniel said as they passed the library doors, “this place won’t feel the same without us cramming till midnight.”
She laughed softly. “True. Though I won’t miss the coffee that tasted like mud.”
He grinned. “Speak for yourself. That mud kept me alive.”
Their banter came easily, the rhythm of it practiced over years. Yet beneath the lightness, Amina felt the ache of something unsaid. She wanted to tell him—how her prayers had grown complicated, how her heart had betrayed her in ways her faith warned against, how she had learned to love him quietly, without permission.
But Daniel’s world was framed by a cross, hers by a crescent. And between them stretched the invisible wall of families, traditions, and expectations neither had chosen.
At the gate, they paused. Behind them, the campus buzzed with life, alive with a joy they both shared but carried differently.
“So,” Daniel said, “see you at graduation rehearsal tomorrow?”
She nodded quickly, afraid her voice would betray her.
“Good,” he said, shifting his bag higher. “Wouldn’t want to walk that stage without my study partner.”
Study partner. The title soothed and cut in equal measure. She forced a smile.
“Never,” she whispered.
He waved and walked ahead, blending into the throng of students flooding the street. Amina stood still, her notebook pressed against her chest, her heart aching with words that would never leave her lips.
Four years had given her knowledge, discipline, and friendship. But it had also given her a secret too fragile to name—a love that lived only in the quiet spaces between laughter and shared notes.
And for now, that had to be enough.

Now I’m low-key panicking,"I moved to a new city recently and jumped back onto dating apps, expecting the usual awkward small talk and one coffee every few weeks.

Instead… I’ve been getting a surprising number of date invites. Flattering, yes. Confusing, also yes. A couple of comments and inside jokes have made me realize that some people might already \*know\* things about me that I usually prefer to ease into slowly. Let’s just say the apps can be very… efficient at spreading information 😅

The problem is: I’m actually pretty shy, and I really don’t want to ruin good dates by saying the wrong thing or making anyone uncomfortable. I’m not trying to play into a stereotype or act like I’m “that confident guy” I’m very much not.

So I’m curious: What helps you relax when you feel like expectations might already exist before a first or second date? And what are subtle things that make you think, \*“oh no, this is going to be awkward”\*, even if the person has good intentions?

1q34dlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q34dlt/i_have_a_growing_finally_online_presence_but_i/,I Have a Growing (Finally!) Online Presence but I think I'm Now Being Stalked by a Killer?,"Hey ya’ll! I have an online presence that is gaining traction (finally!). I have a lifestyle and fitness YouTube channel and Instagram and I mess around on TikTok a bit. Between the three I have a, let's say, sizable and growing online following. People like me because I keep it real and I keep it honest. My smoking hot sports bra and tiny gym shorts selfies don’t hurt either, I’m sure.  I don’t like to use soft language and worry about people’s fragile feelings all the time. Most of my followers love it, but because it’s the internet, the haters gotta hate. 

Normally I’d link my socials anywhere (growth is all about finding opportunities!) but I think I’ll hold off for now. You’ll see why. You all can call me Lily. 

Haters are always a part of the game, I’m pretty familiar with jealous bitches, but this year has been rough on me and I’m just more emotionally susceptible to negative energy right now. I feel like I need to give this context for this all to make sense of why I think one of the haters is a stalker and even a killer. I’ve lost five people close to me this year, one ex-boyfriend, two friends, my grandma and my therapist. I’ve been really sad about it. I even had to miss this big conference I was supposed to be a speaker at because of my grandma dying and it’s all just been a struggle. 

I started out 2025 on such a high note. I began dating this guy, very hot, totally one of the 6’5”, blue eyes, works in finance types. I thought he and I were on the same page. We both really valued and centered ambition, drive, goal setting, and most importantly, goal achieving. That’s what my internet profile is all about. I really think that we as a society are getting too soft. Everything is about work-life balance and resting and validating everyone’s feelings, even when they are bad takes or when their “me” time is quickly outpacing any kind of productivity. People don’t understand the rush of pushing through, even when it’s hard, even when you don’t want to. It’s all about instant gratification and excuses that people dress up as legitimate, like “mental health” and “being in the moment” or whatever. But that’s how you end up fat and broke. It might sound harsh, but it’s true. The truth hurts sometimes. 

Anyway, he was all about gains maxing and his LinkedIn followers. Kind of different from me but definitely similar vibes. We started working out every morning at this cute gym, pretty expensive, but totally worth it for the great spa set up, which turned out to not be so great for him. After the gym we would get green smoothies and spend some time on our laptops, sending emails, updating our socials, whatevs. It sounds mundane but I really could feel it, the connection, the synergy between us. We were so on the same wavelength it wasn’t hard to envision the empire we would build together. 

He would get wealthier and wealthier clients, his income would grow, he’d invest well. My already growing online presence would skyrocket once I was in some more aspirational backgrounds; pilates on a Maldives overwater bungalow, cooking a beautiful zero processed, entirely whole foods, protein packed recipe in a kitchen that gleamed and sparkled in a way that can only be achieved with a full time cleaning staff. 

As I stared at him across the table, his face focused, eyes flashing rapidly across his screen as he read through the comments on his most recent post, I felt it burning in my skin, a kind of itch just beneth the surface. Excitement, the opportunities opening up, the potential, the awesome possibilities glowing brighter and brighter in my mind, a blooming flower made of light so powerful I gasped and had to close my eyes. 

He asked me if I was okay but I was so overcome I could only nod. 

We went on like this for a couple more days, I was practically euphoric, but then one morning I was running a few minutes late. It wasn’t my fault. I had a stupid fight with my neighbor who doesn’t know when to shut up (long story!) and what do I see when I walk in? Him flirting away with the slut at the front desk. 

I know what I got and I don’t tolerate any kind of games, so I knew it was over at that moment. I felt all of that euphoria, that vision of that bright future go up in flames until it lay in my dark mind like a curled ember.  I had burned again, for him, but not with love. 

I don’t mind saying the truth in public, I’m not shy. But I also have class, so I just walked right past them, not making eye contact with him, and left through the other exit. He seemed to get the message, but I couldn’t know for sure because I blocked him on everything. He wasn’t worth the energy to explain anything to. 

Because I blocked him, it wasn’t until I went back to the gym (at a different time than our usual morning spot) like a week later that I learned from a different front desk person that the spa part was closed indefinitely because, get this, my ex slipped in the sauna and bashed the back of his head against the sauna stove! He apparently bled a lot. Gallons and gallons. He obviously didn’t make it. Any time they tried to turn the heat back on in there, it still smelled like blood, so they had to do a deep clean of the whole venting system, or something. 

I told this crazy story to my followers across all my platforms and most of the comments were about how terrible that was and were wishing me well and saying how sorry they were for me. It even went a little viral, definitely more views than I usually get, at least. But like a monkey’s paw wish, higher viewership means more asshole comments. I’ll just copy the first exchange with this weirdo below (username changed, obvs): 

**StalkerWeirdoFreak**: Did you kill him?

**Me**: Ummmmmm…. No? Why would you even say that?

**StalkerWeirdoFreak**: Just cuz you seem kind of off and he had just pissed you off, so, ya know. 

**Me**: That’s messed up. You’re messed up. 

**StalkerWeirdoFreak**: Was that the gym on \[Street Name\] and \[Street Name\]? 

I responded, totally pissed he just tried to dox me, he responded with some more BS about why they thought I killed him, the other commenters jumped in to defend me. It was a mess. But isn’t that so creepy? I didn’t confirm he got the gym right, obviously, but he totally had! I couldn’t go back to that gym and it was a stupid hassle canceling the membership. 

But part of what I always talk about on my platforms is that you can’t let the past slow you down, you can’t let inconveniences or worries stop you from doing what you want to do. I also really value positivity, so even though this was all an ordeal, I decided to see the silver lining in all of this. My subs and viewership numbers had a marked rise because of all of this and I really think that got the ball rolling on my current momentum. 

I think that if there is very little positivity to be had in your life, you have to make it yourself. What I like to do is go to the foothills of the nearby mountains and run along this one path. It goes through this pine tree forest, around a small lake, and then, my favorite part, it opens up to this amazing view of the city, just stunning. There are all these pine trees just behind you, sloping up for what feels like forever, and down below are steep cliffs to a valley of stones and sagebrushes.  The city sits in view of the valley opening, this shimmering thing, haze and heat making it seem like a mirage most of the time, not quite real. It looks huge but also small enough to fit into my hand, depending on perspective. Sometimes I hold my hand out and line it up so that it looks like it’s resting on my palm. 

I like to imagine what it would be like to have it really there. I imagine slowing tilting and titling it so that the tall gleaming building sway and start to bend and break and all the tiny tiny people start to slip and slide and scream. Scream so loud in terror that even I can hear them from so far above them. They plead and cry, but I can’t really make out their words. Their words don’t really matter, only mine do. I like to hold that moment, I like to really be in it. I like not knowing if I will close my hand and turn them to dust or if I will tilt my palm all the way and watch them fall into nothingness or if I will pull it back up, just right, and hear their sobs of relief and feel so great, so merciful, for righting their world back to normalcy. 

That light in that spot is amazing for selfies too. A lot of people like to take selfies on hikes or in the wilderness to make it look like they really exercise, but a lot of them don’t. I really do. I like to run and run until I can taste the blood in the back of my throat and my muscles throb in time with my heartbeat. It calms me. So this lighting is really good at hiding how red my face is. I also use a really subtle filter. Nothing fake, just to help. 

I was up there taking selfies when I started getting a lot of messages in the group chat. I was friends with these two girls, Jamie-Lynn and Marrissa. Jamie-Lynn was a raw vegetarian and Marrissa was a nutritionist turned life coach. They were both so beautiful, not just in appearance, but in their efforts, their carefully framed photos, their daily post schedules, their comment engagement. It really seemed like they were walking their talk. 

They started DMing me even though they had slightly bigger platforms because they could tell I’m going to be big. They were already close friends and they collaborated all the time. They messaged me first together and then had me join this bigger chat.   

The chat was with all the other up and coming health and wellness gurus in the area. They wanted to make a community. I also think some of them were trying to sell stuff sometimes? Like an MLM? But I was so ready to network and mingle when I first got in. I was excited to join because I’ve always said that you are who you hang around. Your friends, the quality and connection of your friends, makes all the difference in the life you’ll have. Unfortunately, like is often the case when you get a group of women together, it turns into mean girl high school cliques all over again. I couldn’t even guess how many sub group chats there are, splintering away to talk about someone else in their little group. The chat didn’t have a lot of going on in it often, so I was surprised at it going off like that. 

Guys. When I opened it, omg, the drama. Jamie-Lynn and Marrissa were talking mad shit, just stiring the pot. People were responding, others were jumping in when it wasn’t even about them. Long story short, somehow I got dragged into it. While I was standing there on that mountain, I was typing away, trying to keep grounded and truthful. Honestly, I was proud of how I was comporting myself, even though those two bitches turned on me. 

It just sucked. It’s not that I don’t think being likable is important but everyone in that chat was so fake and not even really trying to hide it . They all have their rich dads or rich sugar daddies or rich husbands, so they just take Ozempic and have a trainer and get so much filler and botox you could bounce a quarter of their faces, and they go around pretending to know everything. I had stayed friendly, I really had, kept my tone light, but they were all so sensitive. I think that they’re all so fragile because they know that they didn’t really earn any of this. Their  whole lives are built like a stack of cards, their egos made of papier mache, so it was easy, so easy, to crumple them. You didn’t even have to try all that hard. 

Anyway, I calmly finished my run and left the group chat and blocked them all. Who wants to be in that kind of environment? 

I told my followers all about it, of course, naming names and showing receipts once I felt okay enough about it all to talk about it like a week later. And who should show up again even though I blocked him last time? You guessed it, StalkerWeirdoFreak. He came back under a different user name, not that different though. He clearly wants me to know it’s him. I’ll just copy over what he said again: 

**StalkerWeirdoFreak1:** I was kind of kidding before, but are you actually a murderer? This is getting weird. 

**Me**: What are you talking about?

**StalkerWeirdoFreak1:** Jamie-Lynn and Marrissa are dead, they died two days ago in a car accident. Here’s an article. 

For a second, my vision went sort of dark, I was so shocked. I thought I might have to take my video down out of, like, respect for the dead, but this was by far the most engagement and views I’ve gotten in awhile, so I really, really didn’t want to. But I also didn’t want to get cancelled. I really didn’t know what to do. The weirdo went on about how the police were looking into it as a suspicious death, that maybe someone messed with the car’s mechanics, I don’t know. I don't know anything about cars. 

Apparently they couldn’t brake or turn and they went into a ditch and then into a field, the cute little convertible an unfortunate choice, as they ran into a wire fence and were decapitated. Apparently the scene was very disturbing. The wire went right into their necks, making it nice, even cuts, very clean. If it wasn’t for the just buckets of blood and their heads resting neatly beside them rather than on top of their necks, you wouldn’t have thought much of the crash. The rest of the damage was minimal.   

The whole time Weirdo is talking about all this, I’m just watching the comments, biting my fingernails. I want to know if people think I should take it down, if they’ll make me take it down. 

Some people thought I should, but the best thing happened. The video went viral, actually viral! People are wondering if someone in the group chat could have done it. Some people join the weirdo in accusing me, but most of them think it’s somebody else in the chat. I wouldn’t have brought it up if it had been me, right? 

People are so interested, it spreads and spreads. Clips from my video are showing everywhere. Those true crime freaks are all about it. 

I block the weirdo again, but what gets me is this. Not only did he make an alt account to contact me again, which is harassment, he mentioned in his ranting and raving that the field they died on was close to where I live. 

Close. to. where. I. live. 

How does he know where I live? Does he actually know or is he saying that to get attention? I mean, he’s right, it did happen pretty close to me, but did he actually know that or was he just saying that to mess with me, taking a wild guess to make his accusation more plausible? 

Y’all, I really thought about moving. How messed up is that? First my boyfriend dies, then my two closest friends and now because of some loser, I might have to move? How is that fair? 

It’s not fair. I decided to not do it. But I think that was a mistake. 

A few months later, my grandma came to visit me. She’s old fashioned, very religious, but not all that old, very spry, in shape, still pretty scary. She had a gray bob, cut short. She would have looked a lot younger if she had dyed it, but she said that's vanity. She always wore muted colors and modest clothes and just was so judgmental. Any girl showing a shoulder was a temptrest, a slut.  

She had my mom young. Her husband, my grandpa, was much older than her. I don’t remember him well. He’s just this figure rising above me in my memories I’m not even sure are real; tall, brown trousers held up by crossed blue suspenders, like he was from a different era, a different time and place, his face in dark shadow. I can still smell the shoe polish. My grandma said she polished his shoes every day because women are responsible for how their men look, that they have to be tamed to behave. 

My mom had me young too, out of wedlock. My grandparents were very ashamed, but they shouldn’t be. I have a glow about me. I have an it factor. They just didn’t know the blessing they received from my existence. 

My grandpa died when I was young. My dad was never in the picture. My grandma helped raise me. It’s all kind of sad, kind of a typical from the middle nowhere Ohio story. Which is why my grit, my capabilities, my natural charm makes me a real pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps sort of story. That’s why I’m special. Those other girls, they just have it given to them. Not me. Never me. 

Anyway, I didn’t like it when my grandma visited. She made me feel small. And she was coming right around when I was going to go to that big influencer conference in my city. I was going to speak there. I didn’t want to feel small before going there. But it’s not like she ever listened to what I wanted. She was coming when she wanted to come and I better prepare my bedroom for her and get ready to sleep on the couch for the few days she visited. 

Fine. Fine. 

Everybody, it wasn’t fine. But that’s not what I’m writing about. We don’t need to get into the nitty gritty of my family dynamics, right? I’m only bringing it up because I want you all to understand that I had to get away from her. I needed her to leave me alone. I knew she was leaving the next day but it wasn’t soon enough. I wanted her away from me. To be gone from me. As a rather bright suggestion, if I do say so myself, I said she should pray while going on a hike. I told her my favorite path. 

And I won’t lie. Some part of me daydreamed that she would slip, that she would fall down into that rocky valley. I didn’t think she actually would. It took the rescue workers two tries to get all of her back up. She shattered like a ceramic doll, an arm here, a leg there. 

I won’t bore you all with everything that followed. The police, the attorneys, all the questions, so many questions. But it all went away eventually. Eventually, I had time to center myself again. Rather than feeling grief, I felt that silver lining. 

I was finally free. Maybe that’s not how you’re supposed to feel about it. Maybe that’s too dark for some of you. But it is how I felt. I went back to the path a month after her death and I didn’t have the urge to put the city in my palm again. Instead I looked up into the clear blue sky and felt like I was flying, flying so high. I stretched out my arms and they became giant golden wings, bigger than the mountain, and I flew above the city, so small I knew that I could reach down with one heel and crush it all. But I didn’t want to. I didn’t feel like I had to. 

I went home feeling good. Really good. Until I went online. There he was again. 

I hadn’t told my followers very much about my grandmother’s death. I knew I wouldn’t be able to hit the right tone about it authentically, so I just posted one picture of her wreath at her sparsely attended funeral (my mom didn’t even show), said some generic caption and went dark for a couple of weeks. But when I went to my Insta, weirdly the photo had a lot of traction, a lot of comments. One of the commenters was, of course: 

**1StalkerWeirdoFreak:** Your own grandmother? Really? I’m gathering evidence on you. I didn’t want you to know because I wanted you to continue to act crazy so I could get you, but now I’m letting you know because I want you to, ya know, stop killing people. 

**Me**: How fucking dare you. 

**1StalkerWeirdoFreak:** Don’t play indignant. I saw you walking to that path with your grandma and only you coming back, I have proof. It was the \[Trialhead Name\], right? Right? Why don’t you just go turn yourself in now, you sick monster. 

I turned off my phone. I went to my window blinds and closed them. I sat in the middle of my living room. You all, of course, know that that wasn’t true. I mean, I did walk with my grandma to the path to show her where it was, so I’m sure that the stalker had a photo of me going there with her and then leaving without her, but that doesn’t prove anything. I had already told the police about it. He didn’t have shit. But for some reason this, more than him knowing about my gym or at least the area I lived, this felt more personal. The path is mine. My safe place. How could he know? How could he show up there? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? 

Anyway, this was a real low point for me, especially after I had been feeling so high. This is also the first time that it occurred to me that maybe Weirdo stalker was the killer? Do you all think that’s possible? He knew all about those deaths, every single one. He knows so much about me. Some people on the internet, they get twisted, obsessed, you know? Maybe his obsession isn’t like a fan’s but instead something weirder. Maybe he wants to kill but frame me for the murders? 

It sounds kind of crazy, maybe far fetched, I don’t know. But think about it. He watched me leave me grandma on the path. Maybe he followed her in there? Maybe she didn’t slip at all and he pushed her? Maybe all of his accusations were actually confessions? 

At that point, I didn’t know. I just wasn’t sure. But now? Now I’m really thinking it might be the case. 

You see, this all was a few months ago. I ended up moving, which turned out to be great, a much better neighborhood. I was able to afford a better place because my views were higher, my subs were growing. I felt safer, too. I really took care to make sure that I wasn’t being followed to the new place, so I felt better. Secure. 

I decided I needed some therapy. I had so many losses this year, too many. And now a stalker accusing me of murder? It was too much. I really believe in self reliance, resilience and positivity. I think the whole mental health thing is way blown out of proportion and that most “depressed” people just need to get a couple of successes under their belt so that they don’t feel like such losers. 

But everybody has a therapist. All the other YouTubers talk about it. The therapists seem helpful sometimes. I also believe in using all the tools in your tool box to get the job done. Maybe the therapist could help with some of the simpler stuff I was struggling with? Every once in a while I feel pretty, I don’t know, out of it? Kind of like I’m playing the city on my palm game but I can’t quite snap out of it? Just sort of spacy, distracted, like I’m walking besides myself and nothing feels real? Sometimes I think everyone is an NPC. Sometimes I feel like if I reached out my hand would go right through people. Sometimes I imagine that the people in the coffee shop, the grocery store, the park next to me are actually made of clay, just golems with a simple word stuffed into their mouths, moving through life without all the complexities of real people. Sometimes when people walk past I want to take a knife and peel pieces of them off like chunks of clay, just hear the wet thud of the clay hit the ground, let it sit there until I can see it rejoin the earth. 

Anyway, I got a therapist, a man. I know most therapists are women, but I just never got along well with women for some reason, so I thought a dude would be better. He was great. It was the first time that I felt really heard in a long time. It was also the first time that I felt, like, respected by a guy? A lot of guys are pretty dismissive once I tell them what I do for a living, but he was really supportive. I liked him a lot. I wished he could just be my therapist, you know? But overall, it was a good experience. I wanted it to keep going, even if he had to listen to other people’s stupid problems, but. 

Guys, I’m being so for real right now. My therapist was stabbed to death. On Zoom. In front of his client. Maybe some of you guys have heard about it? I know it’s been on the news. Apparently the murderer was wearing all black and a ski mask and used a big kitchen knife. My therapist was in his living room when the client saw a dark figure moving up behind him. She warned him but by the time he turned his head to look, the murderer already stabbed him in the neck. There was so much blood. The client screamed and screamed, called 911 but didn’t know where to tell them to go, it’s not like therapists give you their addresses. 

So the murderer got away. 

In my DMs I got the messages, copied below. I think that this is it. I think this shows that he’s responsible. I think I’m in real danger. How would he know that this was my therapist otherwise? I think he’s hacked my computer? Maybe he's peaking through the windows? Maybe he’s in the house with me? What do you all think?

**Stalker1WeirdoFreak:** This has to stop. It has to stop. You have to stop. What I got last time wasn’t good enough, I admit it. But I got you now. I want you to know. I want you to feel just even a sliver of fear that you made all of those people you killed feel. 

**Stalker1WeirdoFreak:**  Oh, so you’re going to ignore me now? That’s all you got? Wait until you see what I have on you this time. I bet you thought you were being clever, didn’t you? Wearing gloves, wearing a mask? But I followed you there, all the way to his place. I saw you outside \[Therapist’s name\] door. I saw you wailing and crying outside of it, you fucking stalker weirdo freak. You fucking murderer. 

**Stalker1WeirdoFreak:** And it’s not just that you bitch. Just you wait. Just you wait. I’ve got you now. ",4,1767470191.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Husband said he made a new aquaintence yesterday.

I asked how.

He proceeded to tell me about these two people who came to the diner he works at on a first date. The man was super cocky and said he has backups and could date anyone he wants. Husband told me that he was annoyed by the man's attitude and slid her his number on a napkin to put the other man in his place. He said she texted him, then said he told her he is married to a man and was just trying to humble the guy.

I told him to never do that again.

He got frustrated and said, ""Yeah, okay."" In one of those voices that is saying I'm being controlling and over stepping.

We were out at a different diner having a family brunch with our kids when he told me this.

He saw how upset I got and the fact I just lost my appetite entirely and shut down. I stopped eating, went quiet, and simply sipped my coffee.

After a good 10 minutes finally said sorry and said he sees why that would upset me. He said he deleted the text thread after telling her he is married to a man. 

I told him that what he did is textbook flirting and that there is a difference between hitting it off with someone and becoming friends vs slipping them your number when they are on a bad date. 

He said he gets it and won't do it again. He said he was being defensive to me at first when he got annoyed, but thought about it and decided I was right and he was being a jerk.

I still feel really upset. How do I know he isn't telling me this as a cover to go cheat with a woman? That was pretty intense flirting on his part. I feel so angry I could scream, but every time I get upset about anything, nothing comes of it besides a fight, so there is no point. I am distancing myself right now and throwing myself into chores to avoud starting a confrontation. Plus, he already apologized. 

I feel like after six years of being with someone he should know the difference between friendly interactions and flirting. Shouldn't it be a no brainer that doing something like that is flirtatious and cheating behavior? 

Am I crazy? Am I over reacting here?

I purchased my sette 30 after my original Breville BE grinder died. Half a year later i got the 270 adjustment ring which greatly helped. My sette is so old, the counter, counts up and not a countdown like my brothers. Obviously the gearbox crapped out and I did what the typical starter espresso owner does....bought a df64 so i could quickly replace it. I'm mostly a single bean guy and make drinks for both my wife and I everyday.

Anyways, I originally bought the sette based on googling reddit (I wasn't a user then) and their ethos of repairability as I was so annoyed I couldn't easily fix the single broken adjustment ring. Well I got to finally use their mission statement and I was ready to just buy a new gearbox as I was well out of warranty window. On the website they were sold out so i just emailed them asking when it would be in stock. Someone responded very kindly and asked the details surrounding why I needed a new gearbox / motor assembly. I told them, they asked for a video and then just told me they would send me one. Wow I was not expecting that and for $70 bucks I was willing to just buy a whole new gearbox / motor to have a spare grinder or use it strictly for drip coffee.

So I'm just happy I can keep using this stuff as I bought all my machines based upon repairability. I don't really utilize any fancy stuff yall do like flow control / profiling / etc. I just need to make 2 drinks every morning without fail and occasional milk drinks for guests when they come over.

I decided to start prepping ng 8am para matuloy ang lakad namin (kasi almost 2years akong full time at stay at home mom gustong gusto kong lumalabas).

So yung tita ko na umuwi sa province after new year nagyaya magswimming. Gusto ng kids pool, ang gusto naman nya ay dagat. Wala na kaming mapuntahang available na dagat na may pool so ending pinagpool kami tapos nagdagat sila nung driver ng almost 1hr na pagbalik nila ay sakto lang naman sa oras. 

Ngayon itong boyfriend ko acidic. Kumain ng pandesal nung umaga, nag spag habang nagluluto ako, at sa resort nag coffee jelly, siopao, spag, coke at rice. Wala pa sa kalahati ng araw inaacid na sya sobrang sakit daw. Take note sinasabihan ko sya nireremind ko sa mga bawal at hinay hinay sa pagkain pero makulit at hindi matigil kakasigarilyo.

Before sumakit tyan nya, nakapag swim kami, happy lang, enjoy at relax. Yung 1yr old toddler namin ay yung lola ko ang nagbantay, no problem daw sa kanya (mabilis na lublob lang kami since makulit anak ko). Pinaligo pa ni bf baby namin sa pool tapos dalawa kaming nag asikaso after. Ako na gusto pa magswim tinanong ko ng maayos kung pwede pa ako magswim ulit kahit saglit (palas sa swimming kasi sobrang tagal kong walang swimming). Sabi ni bf oo daw at walang problema sa lola ko, tinanong ko pa kung sure si bf, oo daw. 

Pag ahon ko talagang masakit na tyan ni bf so mabilisan ako nagpalit ng tuyong damit walang ligo ligo para ako naman sa bata at dito na sya nagstart magalit at magpoint fingers. Kesyo ang tagal daw ng tita ko, bakit daw kasi aalis iiwan kami di na lang dun nag enjoy kasama kami. Ang akin naman, sabit lang naman kami at dapat nagsabi na sya kanina na masakit tyan nya para either nakabalik agad tita ko (super considerate nya) or pwede naman sya mauna umuwi since may dala syang motor. Sa akin nya binubuhos galit nya na inaaway na nya ako at sinabihan pa ako ""para kang tanga alam mo ng masakit tyan ko naligo ka pa"" tapos nagmumura pa. I mean, nagtanong naman ako kung okay lang at pumayag sya and this rarely happens yung makalabas ako tapos kasama yung only childhood cousins ko na besties in life ko. Nag enjoy lang ako saglit ang dami nyang sinabi samantalang kahit anong sakit pagdaanan ko nagsuka tae ako, nadengue ako, trangkaso, ako pa din nag aalaga sa bata kasi no choice dahil dadalawa kaming magkasama.

Sinabi ko ng mahinahon na hindi nya kailangan magalit at magmura kasi ayaw ko ng ganun. Pinaliwanag ko pa na pwede sya mauna umuwi para makaligo, inom ng gamot at pahinga agad kaya na namin ng lola ko ang bata. Pero mas nagalit pa sya. Saka nagsabi naman tita ko ng maayos nagtanong din, all smiles pa sya na go daw, enjoy daw sa dagat.

At this point di ko alam kung kakampihan ko ba sya, ivavalidate ko gusto nya na sisihin tita ko,  may sinabi pa na bubugbugin daw nya pagdating ng sasakyan (I hate violence), o sa tita ko ako magside. Pero gumitna ako kasi anong magagawa ko gusto magdagat nung tao at sakto naman sa oras yung pagbalik sa resort para sunduin kami. Tapos sumagi pa sa isip ko na walang naman kami binayaran akala mo sya gumastos lahat kung magalit. Actually ayaw pa umahon ng mga bata kasi wala pang 6pm nag eenjoy pa sila. 

Hanggang pag uwi talagang galit sya, hinataw pa yung motor kahit alam nyang hirap ako humawak. At pag uwi diretso ako sa labahin, dinadaan daanan nya lang ako na napansin pa ng mama ko bat daw di ako tinutulungan, nagsinungaling na lang ako kasi syempre gulo yon pag sinabi ko ang totoo. Pero kahit ganon, imbes na awayin ko sya o kung ano pa, inasikaso ko pa din sila ng bata all the while naglalaba ako.

One time my colleague was there and we went for coffee, he showed me where the company does free candy and coffee for employees. We chatted about what we did and didn't like about work. After then we kind of ended up going to the office on the same day and catching up.

At some point he started talking about things which I thought were a bit personal. He asked me when I lost my virginity, if I was attracted to east Asians, how many girlfriends I've had, if I ever cheated on my partner. I mostly tried to change the subject or just flat out say I didn't want to share this information. I started to feel a bit uneasy but I tried to overlook it. Something else that I found weird was that when other colleagues were in, he didn't ask others to come for coffee, it was just me and him.

He asked me a while ago for my WhatsApp number to share some coupon code. Then last week he texted me, initially about Christmas but then said he had something personal he wanted to ask me. Without me agreeing he said he was having trouble in bed with his wife and he went into quite a bit of detail, I don't even want to repeat what he asked. He asked me if I'd experienced anything like that. I just said I haven't and suggested he talk to his GP. Then he repeated something very specific and asked if I'd ever had that. He deleted all the messages a few hours later.

At the time I just thought, he wanted to ask a medical question for some reason. But I realised afterwards my colleague just asked me a question about my dick and I wasn't ok with that, even if it was genuinely asked in a medical context. He sent me at least 5 other WhatsApp messages the following days, which I haven't read as I honestly feel the ick and I feel like I don't want to talk to this person.

We have such an interesting cocktail here: the mostly MAGA Christian Nationalism people from the surrounding neighborhoods and cities and the freaky poly-bi-Bluish-Buddhist owners. We now debate, argue, and laugh together. Eulogio and Dee are taking a contingent of clients to snow shovel at [Highmark Stadium](https://share.google/2gR4n3DBzo6sgDdfX).*

*It started out as people coming here for weekend parties, willing to live in chilly three-season RVs with heating systems that keep the rigs livable but not comfortable. This year many arrived with four-season RVs which they picked up over the past year and they stay here during the week.*

*Even more significant is the emotional climate change. We all know that our interchanges are not going to change anyone’s ideologies. But we are listening to each other. It’s interesting but now the Fam & Friends are streaming the Canadian show [“The Listener”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Listener_(TV_series)) on Prime. All right, we have no psychic telepathic skills--except if you consider believing in and seeing the Buddha nature of frenemies-turning-friends.

Time to reflect on some articles in the January 1, 2026 World Tribune that inspire me. [Frontline News: What Happens When You Dive In](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/what-happens-when-you-dive-in/) is a report on two guidance sessions at the recent SGI Autumn Training Course in Tokyo. 

SGI General Director Yoshiki Tanigawa spoke about how to create momentum for sharing Buddhism with young people. He started by discussing the historical significance of 2026:

>To be sure, next year marks the 70th anniversary of the Osaka Campaign of 1956, in which the Osaka members, uniting around a young Daisaku Ikeda, introduced 11,111 households to the Soka Gakkai in the single month of May. In the process, they both created a blueprint for making the impossible possible with faith and turned the tide in accomplishing second Soka Gakkai President Josei Toda’s goal to introduce 750,000 households to Buddhism during his lifetime.

Some of our friends across the hedges smirk about our determination to introduce by 2030 10,000 youth to Buddhism in the United States. They provide all types of reasons why this is impossible. Unfortunately, it’s an inconvenient truth for them that, as a youth, Daisaku Ikeda accomplished a similar feat and established the way to do this. Mr. Tanigawa states:

>It’s up to each person to make a determination, to muster up a stronger life force, to become aware of your own mission and to stand up. It must start with you, and it must be felt by those closest to you.”

I can do this! Other people are doing it in their own way. I am following the March for Peace conducted by some Buddhist monks and all the media attraction it has gained. Good for them! Look at a [sample](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/16kCzhh9x3/) of how much thoughtful reflection and debate it has sparked among many Christians.

Doing what I can in my circumstances, I focus on taking good care of my children so they can grow into leaders of value-creation as they get older. I am so proud to contribute on the sidelines to the development of the Longhouse School so a small group of BIPOC students, historically confined to limited futures, can escape the gravitational pull of low expectations and soar. I also choose to follow the highway of [the discussion meeting movement](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/our-great-discussion-meeting-movement/) initiated around the world by Daisaku Ikeda. 

The article also summarizes two points that Soka Gakkai President Minoru Harada summarized about how the young Daisaku Ikeda won the campaign in Osaka: basing everything on the Gosho and meeting with members to offer personal guidance. It’s an important read, but I ran out of time!",0,1767469651.0,SGIWhistleblowersMITA,0,0.5,False

So in short, i moved from france to an island near canada. I moved my things, including my nespresso citiz by boat, it was a 3 weeks journey and my boxes waited for me 1 week at the harbour. 

none of my other kitchen appliance ( brand new rice cooker, toaster, kettle ... ) suffered from the cold ... 

  
After unpacking my citiz i tried to make myself a coffee but all the 5 buttons started to light up in sync, checked the manual and it said it has to do with a temperature issue - so it checks out with the month in a cold boat and warehouse.... I still try to press a button... the water comes out from the back, right at the little hole between the water tank and the body of the citiz, where it overflows and spills everywhere. I don't really know what to do. I can't send my machine to nespresso because there is no store on my island. 

Of course, i Tried to descale it but it's no use because the water doesn't go through the machine at all but exits before entering it ... 



If you had a similar issue i'd really appreciate the help. I really it's salvageable... thanks a lot ! ",3,1767469615.0,nespresso,4,1.0,False

I’ve been using the Orea Z1 for the last couple months and really enjoy the consistency, but otherwise I’ve always used a V60.   


Anyways, I’ve been drinking a lot of natural processed or alternatively processed “funkier” coffees lately, and have read that a grinder with more body and less clarity can be preferred for those, especially co-ferments which honestly I’ve never dialed in or liked with the ZP6. 

I’ve tried using the Q2 instead and it definitely blends the flavors together more (less separation) and adds more body or fullness, but the large amount of fines the Q2 adds vs the ZP6 results in significantly longer drawdowns and sometimes stalling with something like a natural Ethiopian, so it’s hard to have and ideal comparison between the Q2 and ZP6 since so many variables shift.

I’ve been eyeing the K-Ultra and my main question is how much better the grind consistency is over the Q2, and if it would produce significantly less fines that would allow for faster drawdowns for more accurate comparison with the ZP6 when trying to really optimize a coffee.

Would love anyone’s thoughts and experiences with these two, thanks!",2,1767469579.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

he’s done a few thoughtful things for me (like buying me coffee for my birthday even though we weren’t super close at the time and offering to give me vouchers for something through his company)

the weird vibes though.. i think it kind of started after this incident:
so i was in a vc with the crush, my sibling, and a gamer friend (who has zero filter btw). the crush made a joke about him and the gamer friend, and the gamer friend goes “oh i’m not gay” as a joke and then out of nowhere says, “A (me) is single though. if you wanna shoot your shot, you can do it with her.”

literally no one said anything after that. we all just sat in silence for like a min 😭

then the gamer friend asks me, “A, are you looking to date someone?” and i’m like, “uhh that’s such a random question, don’t make me crash out rn.” and then i hear the guy go, “i wanna see you crash out”

idk that was just a weird situation and the silence was just so awkward. the vibes were just slightly off after this and talking to him just feel awkward idk maybe it’s my avoidant issues

just so everyone knows, we are long distance. funny coincidence though, i had actually planned a trip to visit his state on the weekend of his birthday before we even met. my friends tell me that i should make plans to meet up with him but as an avoidant, im too scared to ask especially when idek how he feels",1,1767469409.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False
1q341bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1q341bp/hes_doing_it/,he’s doing it!,"Exactly 300 days ago, I vented on here about an incident with my AH. At the time, he was drunk and it led to a bad argument and I was left feeling so lost as well as physically hurt.

We then started weekly couples therapy. He was out of work, our son was about to turn one, and it was my last ditch effort to “fix” this before he ultimately goes to rehab again (he went once in 2023 and it was the best year in so long that led us to being pregnant! as much as he was so happy to become a Dad, something snapped and he started drinking hard again).

The following 40 days after starting therapy, he relapsed a few times and it was the most difficult journey trying to navigate early recovery. We continued therapy for almost 2 months hoping that he would just “get it”. He participated in in-person and online meetings. Sometimes he would just sit in the parking lot and cry without ever going inside. We listened to a lot of Joe and Charlie’s workshop, and he would be in tears reading the big book aloud to me. We played lots of video games together while our son was asleep and just TALKED. Cried and talked. 
I remember crying and laughing talking about how he couldn’t even listen to country music anymore because they were all about drinking. 

But he did it. Cold turkey. The first two weeks were brutal. He was so emotionally irrational. The withdrawals were hell. He was more Jekyll and Hyde than ever. Trust was still at an all time low. We were close to just calling it quits and going to rehab but something stuck after his last relapse.

He found a new job that he absolutely loves and gained a new routine. His heart is in a kitchen and his amazing cooking job brings him great joy and pride. His boss and coworkers love working with him and laugh when they offer him a beer after his shift only for him to ask if there are any non-alcoholic beers around. He’s around plenty of people who like to drink and he can’t even fathom starting again. He says he feels gross just thinking about it.
He just kissed me goodbye on his way to work that he’s been blissfully going to since April.

Each day sober, we would write the number on our whiteboard as part of our son’s night time routine. It quickly became something he found exciting and to proud of. 

Couples therapy helped immensely. We found a counselor that also was in recovery and knew all the ins and outs of alcoholism. I learned a lot from the perspective of an alcoholic and gained true empathy and expectations. He learned how an alcoholic of a loved one affects their wellbeing especially if they continue to stick by you. I owe so much to our therapist and I know he’ll be happy to see how far we’ve come along.

He has been most present father, partner, son, brother, and friend. He still feels shame and remorse for his wrongdoings over the last decade and he’s trying to make up for lost time by just being present and sober. It’s like I have my old funny and witty boyfriend again… except he’s even better. He’s extremely grateful and thankful for everything we have considering what we all went through. And he continues to go up and beyond to be considerate and be the best person he can be. 

He’s clear headed. Has a better memory. Has all the energy in the world. Even lost 30 lbs. He is no longer on AUD treatments, blood pressure meds, sleep meds, or antidepressants. 

I couldn’t ask for a better person to be a daddy to our son. Watching them play and seeing how well our son is growing and learning in our home is something I couldn’t even anticipate a year ago. I was constantly depressed and angry back then and now I am just so relaxed. I was even worried while I was pregnant because I was sobbing so often. It’s like a dream come true. I’m a better person and mother now that this house is a sober home.

I love him more now. I’m IN love again and I also feel very loved unconditionally. I trust him again with cash and all our bank cards. I’m less triggered by certain things that made me doubt his sobriety. If I could be grateful for just one thing, its the peace of mind again in my life. Loss of trust and gaining that back was extremely hard for me. And sometimes, I would bring him to tears and anxiety when I would find him guilty for innocent actions. Boy, we went through a lot emotionally this last 260 days. We’re healing from it and doing a lot better in our relationship.

But he did it. He’s doing it!
260 days. We were elated at just 60 days!
Now it’s just another day. 
Now our biggest problem is my coffee machine sputtering and budgeting after the holidays. 
How blessed am I to have these problems when his alcoholism used to be killing him and everything we held near and dear?

I’m still healing. So is he. I still have trauma that kicks my ass some days. And he’ll forever be an alcoholic. But by his own will and determination and the grace of God, he goes to bed sober and wakes up the next day and does it all over again. He and I came out of the dark tunnel as stronger individuals and are a stronger unit. And we’re not looking back!

260 days. and counting!

# HAVING RED HAIR AND HAVING KNACKS ARE DEMON SIGNS

Red hair and knacks are two things that Kvothe has that are demon sign.  There are no 'demons', only faens, according to Bast.  Kvothe is a little fae around the edges.  Some theories guess he is part faen, and some (like myself) think Kvothe is a descendant of Iax the first faen (both are musicians with changing eyes and bad luck and get holes in their shirts).

* *A couple hundred years ago, a person was good as dead if folk saw he had a knack. The Tehlins called them demon signs, and burned folk if they had them.*
* *I have red hair, bright. If I had been born a couple hundred years ago I would probably have been burned as a demon.*
* *“You are an educated man. You know there are no such things as demons.” Bast smiled a terrible smile. “There is only my kind.”*
* *“I’ll believe that,” Deoch said. “There’s something about him I like. He’s a little fae around the edges. I hope he plays for us tonight.”*

*\_\_*

# KVOTHE HAS A KNACK FOR NAMES

Most of us have heard this theory before.  Kvothe calls the name of the wind and Felurian's name, but also has a gift for guessing names correctly and giving new names that are fitting, sometimes in spite of his own logic.

* Kvothe is wrong about the meaning of 'Keth Selhan' but he is still right about it being a good name.
   * *“Didn’t the name tip you off?” the tinker chuckled. “Keth-Selhan? Lord boy, someone’s been thumbing their nose at you.”*
* Kvothe is wrong about the meaning of 'Auri' but he is still right about it being a good name.
   * *“Ah,” I said, embarrassed. “Because she’s so bright and sweet. She doesn’t have any reason to be, but she is. Auri means sunny.”*
* Kvothe correctly guesses Nell's name.
   * *So her name really was Nell. I would have found that amusing under different circumstances.*
* Kvothe arguably correctly guesses Shehyn's three-part name.
   * *You are beautiful, Shehyn. For in you is the stone of the wall, the water of the stream, and the motion of the tree in one.*
* Kvothe almost names Denna's patron 'Ferule'.
   * *“Just tell me when I hit one you like…Federick the Flippant. Frank.* ***Fe****ran. Fo****ru****e. Forda****le***\*….”\*

He also seems to know Caesura is a better fitting name than Saicere, and that Verainia's nickname was Nina, and more I'm probably forgetting.

\_\_

# KVOTHE HAS A KNACK FOR UNTYING/UNLOCKING

This one has been discussed a lot too.  Kvothe uses his lockpicking skills throughout the book, but he also accidentally opens locked things, and indirectly compares his skill with untying knots to a knack.

* *They tried to teach me sailor’s knots, but I didn’t have a* ***knack*** *for it, though I proved to be a dab hand at untying them.*
* *I laughed, then shouted, “Edro!” in my best Taborlin the Great voice and struck the top of the box with my hand. The lid sprung open. I was surprised as everyone else, but I hid it better.*
* *At first the handle didn’t move at all, but when I jiggled it in frustration, the latch turned and the door opened a crack. “Thought it was locked,” Inyssa said, frowning.*

\_\_

# KVOTHE HAS A KNACK FOR SYMPATHY AND MEMORIZATION?

Kvothe calls his skill with sympathy a knack.  This could be a coincidence, but I think Rothfuss loves using terms with dual meanings to misdirect the reader and hide truths in plain sight.

* *But I grabbed at whatever he could teach me about sympathy...... I seemed to have a* ***knack*** *for it above and beyond my natural penchant for absorbing knowledge*

Again, Kvothe calls his skill with memory a knack.  Again, this could be coincidence.

* *I fought down the urge to sigh. Even with my trouper’s* ***knack*** *for learning lines it would take long, weary days setting them all to memory.*

\_\_

# MOST IMPORTANTLY, KVOTHE HAS A KNACK FOR GETTING THINGS RIGHT WITHOUT THINKING

Some of Kvothe's naming talent happens by accident.  Kvothe names Auri the right name but doesn't know why and even mistranslates what it means.  The exact same thing happens with Keth-Selhan.

Some of Kvothe's unlocking talent happens by accident.  He doesn't know what Edro means, but he unlocks the bandit's chest when he says it.  He unlocks the classroom door just by jiggling it.

Kvothe, 'without thinking', comes up with a solution that took Kilvin 10 years to think of, which will likely be the longest burning lamp Kilvin has ever made.

* *“Lithium salt?” I asked* ***without thinking***\*, then backpedaled.\*
* *Your guessing this thing surprised me, as it took me ten years to think of it..... if it burns six more days it will be my best lamp in these ten years.*

Kvothe accidentally discovers 'spinning leaf', which brings answers without thinking.

* *Spinning Leaf seemed largely useless. It was relaxing to let my mind grow clear and empty, then float and tumble lightly from one thing to the next. But aside from helping me draw answers to Tempi’s questions out of thin air, it seemed to have no practical value.*

Kvothe accidentally confirms his status as a young noble's son (he knows his mom might be noble, but not how high ranking I suppose).

* *I looked old, older at any rate. Not only that, I looked like some young noble’s son.*
* *However, unlike Stapes, I wore the clothes with the casual ease of nobility.*

*\_\_*

# WHAT ELSE MIGHT KVOTHE GET RIGHT WITHOUT THINKING?

This might suggest that other things he does without thinking are the smart things to do.  He uses formal language with Denna, offers her his talent pipes, and declines an invitation into Fela's rooms... where these decisions all 'of the Lethani'?

* ***Without thinking,*** *all the courtly manners my mother had drilled into me came to the fore. I reached out smoothly and clasped Denna’s outstretched hand in my own*
* ***Without thinking***\*, I reached up to the collar of my cloak and unpinned my talent pipes. “Only this much,” I said, holding them out to her.\*
* *“I can’t stay,” I said* ***without thinking***\*, struggling against the urge to gawk openly.....  I realized I had turned down an invitation from a near-naked Fela to join her in her room.\*

Does Kvothe accidentally confirm Denna is a Lackless relative, by his lie that she is his cousin?

* *“Oh good.” I said, my mind racing for a plausible lie. “I have family up in those parts I was thinking of visiting.”*
* *“My cousin was here for a wedding,” I said, “and I heard there was some trouble.”*
* *“At twere meh coosin,” I said, making a nod toward Denna.*
* Denna has features matching Meluan, so it may be that Denna is a Lackless (or Lackey or Laclith etc.)
   * Denna: *her jaw strong and delicate*
   * Meluan: *strikingly lovely, with a strong jaw*
   * Denna: *Her hair was arranged to display her elegant neck*
   * Meluan: *her curling chestnut hair was pulled back to reveal her elegant neck.*
   * Denna: *a sharp contrast against her pale skin*
   * Meluan: *looking over Meluan’s features, taking note of her pale skin*
   * Denna: *Her face was oval....... She was lovely as a flower*
   * Meluan: *I could not keep them from your fair flower face.*
   * Denna: *She had long, dark hair*
   * Meluan: *artfully curled chestnut hair*
   * Denna: *Her eyes were dark. Dark as chocolate, dark as coffee*
   * Meluan: *with a strong jaw and dark brown eyes*

Does Kvothe accidentally show that the Masters send men to investigate rumors, by his lie that the University sent him to investigate in Trebon?

* *The map was covered in a layer of clear alchemical lacquer, and there were notes written at various points in red grease pencil,* ***detailing rumors*** *of desirable books and the last known positions of the various acquisition teams.*
* *“The masters down at the University heard some odd rumors and sent me here to find out if they were true,” I said. There was no awkwardness or hesitation in the lie.*
* *But when we hear strange rumors, someone needs to go out and find out what’s really happened.*

*\_\_*

# KVOTHE IS BAD AT LOGIC (AKA GETTING THINGS RIGHT BY THINKING)

Kvothe hates reading Rhetoric and Logic.

* *It was Rhetoric and Logic, the book Ben had used to teach me argument. Out of his small library of a dozen books it was the only one I hadn’t read from cover to cover. I hated it.*

Kvothe is only described reading Rhetoric and Logic at the end of his three years in Trebon, where it was the only book he owned.

* *I opened it to the first page and read the inscription Ben had made more than three years ago.  ""Kvothe, Defend yourself well at the University. Make me proud. Remember your father’s song. Be wary of folly. Abenthy.""  I nodded to myself and turned the page.*

Kvothe can't remember facts about logic from Rhetoric and Logic.

* *“Name the nine prime fallacies,” he snapped. “Simplification. Generalization. Circularity. Reduction. Analogy. False causality. Semantism. Irrelevancy….” I paused, not being able to remember the formal name of the last one. Ben and I had called it Nalt, after Emperor Nalto. It galled me, not being able to recall its real name, as I had read it in Rhetoric and Logic just a few days ago.*

Sim calls Kvothe out for logical fallacy.

* *“That’s a logical fallacy,” Sim pointed out eagerly.*

Lorren calls Kvothe out for logical fallacy.

* *“By your logic I should also be in charge of Solinade dances, needlework, and horse thieving.”*

Penthe calls Kvothe out for logical fallacy.

* *I fumed, but she was right. I was committing a fallacy of analogy. It was faulty logic.*

Uresh calls Kvothe out for logical fallacy.

* *“You can’t prove nonexistence,” Uresh interjected in a matter-of-fact way. He sounded exasperated. “Flawed logic.”*

Kvothe is thoughtless; he doesn't think.

* You’re clever. We both know that. But you can be thoughtless. A clever, thoughtless person is one of the most terrifying things there is.
* When I looked up, Ben’s eyes were furious. “What were you thinking?” he hissed. “Well? What? What were you thinking?”

Kvothe tries to use logic to measure how much denner to give the draccus and fails.  Denna's instinct to give the draccus all of the denner might have made the difference, since Kvothe winds up only using 2/3rds of the resin.  This may be because the draccus has been eating charcoal, which is said to absorb denner resin.

* *“Just give him all of it,” Denna said. “Better safe than sorry.”*
* *It contained about a third of all the resin we’d found...... I doubled it yet again, rolling out another forty-two balls of the resin* 

*\_\_*

Bought all three (this is lavAzza USA, packaged in West Chester, PA) and see absolutely no difference in the bean, the roast or anything else. Beans look the same, taste the same (chewed and espresso-machine-brewed).

They think it's smart marketing, I think it's a scam. Or it's my taste buds and lightening at home that mislead me?

What about the other packaging--same sh\*t?

1q33xju,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q33xju/specific_steps_i_took_to_start_winning_against_my/,Specific steps I took to start winning against my phone/devices addiction,"I have been addicted to my devices and have been actively trying to combat. First, I did quite a few experiments and that gave me many insights which helped. Even if you don't like any of the insights below, try experimenting and nailing down when you become addicted and how.

If this resonates, read on...

**When do I become a slave to my devices?**

\- Mornings, if I start using my phone or laptop before fully waking up

\- Nights, if the last thing I did was watch a screen before going to sleep

(on days I didn't do this, I automatically make better choices)

**How do I become a slave**

\- When I don't first use other emotion regulation tools and default to using phone as that tool

(on days I am a slave, there is very little I can do to fix it, so my strategy is prevention)

**Day when I win**

\- When I occupy myself in the morning and then pick up the phone. I do that by making coffee and quick but cooked breakfast & have that before going to phone

\- Between the time I am awake and fully woken up, I do positive affirmations in the mind, basically, how my day will be amazing and how I am amazing too. That can't be done if phone takes up space

\- I do bed time yoga or read a book or talk or even do quick journaling before going to bed (there are some specifics on yoga and journaling if you are interested)

**How does it look for long term..**

\- I never joined Instagram and left FB many years ago

\- 6 months with grayscale and plan to keep it

\- I keep reminding myself how terrible devices are as tools for emotional regulation

\- When I do use devices as tools for emotional regulation, I tolerate a few minutes of discomfort before doing that to make it intentional

\- Daily meditation, weekly therapy and almost daily yoga to keep myself sane (most people may not need this much)

\- Bring fun things in life, these days it's volleyball, k-drama, reading and talking to my partner

**P.S. We are all different, I am genuinely curious, how does this all work for you?**",2,1767469163.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False
1q33vxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1q33vxw/dallas_police_have_solved_the_disappearance_of/,"Dallas Police Have Solved The Disappearance Of Norman Prater After Remains Identified (January, 1973)","On January 14th, 1973, 16 year old Norman Prater was reported missing by his family from Dallas, Texas. He was last seen around midnight at an all night coffee shop before telling his mother he was going home. His mother reported seeing him with two other teenage boys, and an older hispanic man she did not recognize. 

The case went cold with police suspecting Prater had possibly been abducted or killed. Investigators had very few leads in Praters case with it going cold for years with them suspecting he was the victim of a homicide. However this all changed recently when police announced over Facebook on January 2nd that Prater’s remains had been positively identified and connected to a hit and run on July 9th, 1973. 

That day an unidentified man was discovered by police, who believed he had been killed in a hit and run crash on Highway 35 in Rock Port, Texas, in Aransas County a few days prior to the discovery. Authorities were able to determine that the John Doe was of Caucasian descent and was possibly between the ages of 15-20 years old. Investigators called the remains the Aransas John Doe for years with no leads in their case. 

Recently investigators were able to get into contact with Prater’s brother after Dallas Police Detective Ryan Dalby reexamined both cases and was able to identify specific details which linked both cases together. After getting into contact with Prater’s brother he gave a positive ID of the hit and run victim as being his brother Norman. The identification by his brother along with the details noticed by the detective were enough for Dallas police to officially close Norman’s case.

1q33vuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q33vuo/every_summer_the_kids_in_my_town_are_forced_to/,"Every summer, the kids in my town are forced to attend a mandatory summer camp. It held a horrific secret (Part 4)","Fuller stepped towards Nick. 

It was the first time I’d seen him as a commander, not a teacher.

“I said, stand up *straight*, soldier.”

“What a fucking asshole,” the guy holding me hissed. His body went rigid when Nick obeyed, his palm pressing harder over my mouth, like he knew I was about to lose it. 

I forced myself still, swallowing the urge to squeeze my eyes shut.

Nick stood motionless, arms by his sides, staring straight ahead into nothing. When Fuller pulled out a crumpled tissue to wipe the boy’s bloody nose, my stomach turned. 

That smug, triumphant look, the same one he always wore in class contorted his expression. 

He circled Nick like a predator, inspecting every inch of him.

Nick trembled, eyes flickering, lips quivering, whatever humanity was left inside him was slipping away. 

Fuller didn’t care.

“You’re a fighter, aren’t you?” he said, almost amused.

The man chuckled. “Even while suffering the first signs of defection, what appears to be a hemorrhage, you’re still standing. Impressive.”

Nick didn’t respond. I watched rivulets of red trail down the curve of his throat.

“One of our strongest minds,” Fuller said, pride swelling in his voice. 

He turned to the soldier beside him. 

“This boy marks the beginning of something extraordinary. I want every defective recruit that’s still breathing brought in. He’s part of a batch with potential. Proof lies in his resilience, his ability to withstand defection.”

He shoved Nick, but my friend didn’t even flinch.

“If processing failed the first time, we’ll keep at it until it doesn’t. Recruit 13 is an anomaly we welcome. Run another cleanse to make sure the former personality has been fully erased.”

“Yes, sir.” The soldier nodded.

Fuller folded his arms, narrowing his eyes at Nick. “Recruit 13. How are you feeling right now?”

“I feel nothing,” Nick said flatly.

“Uh-huh.” Fuller stepped closer, until they were almost touching. “What about thoughts? Anyone come to mind? Friends? Family? You were quite vocal before we purged that personality. Do you still want to tear me apart, Nicholas?” 

His tone turned mocking. “What was it you said when I strapped you down and gave you anesthesia you didn’t deserve? Ah, yes. You were going to rip out my eyes, stick them up my ass, and make me eat them.”

A sick satisfaction gleamed in his eyes. He knew Nick would obey now, no matter what. Fuller shoved him back again.

“Such a sharp tongue, Nicholas,” he sneered. “I hope you know I enjoyed severing it from your filthy mouth.” 

He leaned in, voice low and cruel. 

“And I enjoyed stripping every independent thought that ever dared bloom in that hollow brain of yours.” 

Fuller tapped Nick’s head with a smile. “You were born to be an Aceville soldier. And might I say, you’re my favorite one yet.”

The teacher seemed to revel in antagonizing the boy, yet I couldn’t ignore the flicker of urgency in his tone. 

He wasn’t just enjoying the power he held over Nick, he was ensuring that every trace of the boy was erased.

“I said speak!” he snapped.

Nick answered through a mouthful of glistening, pooling red. “I have no thoughts, sir.”

Fuller’s grin made my stomach turn. “Does the name Benjamin Castor mean anything to you?” 

This time he leaned in uncomfortably close. 

The real Nick would have spat in his face. 

“Your father hated you from the start,” he murmured. “As for your mother, the moment you were born, we slaughtered and then incinerated her.” He stepped back. 

“Beth wasn’t on the same page as us. I worked with her. Agent Carter was one of our best. She could put a bullet in any kid’s skull without hesitation, but somehow, we lost her to you.” 

Fuller’s lip curled in disgust. “That’s right. Beth bonded with you while you were still inside her. I’d never seen anything like it. She actually cared for you, the genetically modified fetus we implanted in her. She saw you as more than a tool, more than a cog in our machine. She saw you as her son.”

He sneered. “A shame you survived the programming. Mother and son could have been reunited, the traitor and her failed experiment.”

My teacher’s words cut deep. Nick’s hope had been to meet the mother he never knew. 

Fuller wanted to see if any part of him would break, if anything remained to purge. 

He shoved Nick, but Nick didn’t budge. “You weren’t even born yet, and somehow you managed to turn one of our own against us.” 

His laugh was sharp and bitter. “And what about Elizabeth Carter, your pathetic mother, who let emotion get the better of her and paid for it with her blood?""

“I feel nothing,” Nick said.

But I caught it, the hesitation, the small pause between his words.

Fuller didn’t notice. He straightened, giving a satisfied nod.

“Interesting. I thought some part of him might hold on, maybe wouldn't be affected by the new serum. But recruit 13 is empty. He’s defecting. Which means he needs to be processed immediately.”

His brows pinched. Then he twisted and swung a punch at Nick’s face.

I expected his fist to land and Nick to hit the ground, but my friend moved faster than I’d ever seen, springing to life. Only it wasn’t the kind of awareness I wanted. 

It was whatever they had put inside him, the so-called sleeper, triggered by a direct attack. Nick was quick, his face blank as he ducked and grabbed the instructor by the neck, lifting him clean off the floor.

It didn’t seem real. Just weeks ago, Nick could barely carry me for a piggyback ride. 

Now he was something else entirely, exactly what Fuller wanted him to be. The man let out a shriek of laughter, a grin spreading across his face.

“Yep,” said the guy holding me, pulling me down behind a tree. I could smell the metal from his gun as it brushed my ear. “Fuller’s just as batshit crazy as I remember, and he calls himself an agent?”

“Fascinating!” My teacher, still in Nick’s stranglehold, choked out. “This one is defecting, and his reaction times are perfect!”

He barked at Nick to let him go, and the boy’s grip around his neck loosened, allowing him to hit the ground. The teacher was barely fazed before going in again. 

This time, he went for the kill, shoving the boy backward with one hand while reaching into his jeans with the other to pull out his glock. 

Again, it was like watching a movie. 

With vacant eyes and movements driven purely by reflex, Nick disarmed the weapon, slammed the teacher to the ground, and pressed the barrel into the back of his skull.

The teacher was playing with his toy. 

Next, Nick was ordered to disarm another soldier, this time without using his hands. To my shock, he managed it. With a simple jerk of his hand, the magnum slammed into the flesh of his palm.

As if driven by an invisible force.

“Okay, you’ve got to admit, that’s impressive,” the British guy whispered. “They must have upgraded the specs. I’m pretty sure our class never got whatever I’m looking at.”

After a moment, Fuller composed himself. “If his brain can submit again, and we manage to preserve the body, we’ve struck gold with this year’s recruits.” He straightened his jacket.

“Yes, we may have lost many due to errors,” he continued, eyes gleaming, “but our survivors? Look at them! I’ve never seen strength and reaction times like this, not to mention psychic abilities on par with our 2018 class. If we can capture every defector still breathing and reprogram them, this year will be our best yet. Nicholas is living proof.”

The boy holding me groaned. “Yeah, I’m not listening to this shit. That man is a psycho.”

When he dragged me back, my body reacted automatically. 

“No!” I tried to scream into his hand, but he was too fast.

I wanted to say I wouldn’t leave Nick to that fate again, but his hold on me was impossible to break. 

He pulled me into the trees once more. Twisting my head, I caught a glimpse of Nick being led away with the others. 

I struggled all the way to the clearing, where he finally dropped me into a heap before letting out an exasperated breath.

I hit the ground face first, getting a mouthful of dirt and leaves.

When I lifted my head, a familiar blur of golden curls lay next to me. Bobby. She was on her back, eyes shut peacefully, scarlet trails staining her chin.

Bobby was still defecting.

“Sam.”

A familiar voice sounded, like wind chimes. “You don’t have to be so rough.”

When I glanced up, the blonde I thought I’d hallucinated earlier was standing over me. 

Her face was unmistakable, pretty features carved into perfect, porcelain skin that was paler, a lot paler. 

She looked older, though only by a few years, early twenties maybe.

Her hair fell in unbrushed ringlets that she had to sweep out of her eyes, no longer in the childish ponytail I remembered from all those years ago. 

I was still seeing her younger self.

I had never forgotten her, Clara Danvers, sprinting across rough tarmac, frenzied, wide eyes. Those eyes had once been full of childlike fear. When I looked into them now, they were hollow, haunted.

For a moment, I was caught between wrapping my arms around the girl I’d thought was dead and jumping up to grab Bobby and run back to Nick. I needed to know he was okay. To know that he truly had been hesitating. That he was still in there somewhere.

I was shaking when the girl loomed over me, her arms crossed over a ratty jacket. She moved slowly, like I was a rabid animal. I wanted to scream at her and the guy for taking me away from Nick. But before I could, she held out a hand for me to grab.

Clara’s smile was kind. “You’re Adeline, right?”

I managed to nod, letting her pull me to my feet.

In the dim light of the afternoon bleeding through the trees, I could finally see the guy. 

I could tell just by looking at him that his younger self had been on the varsity team. Sam was an older version of Nick, with the same hollow eyes as Clara that aged him well past twenty-two. 

Blinking rapidly through the rays of sunlight seeping through the trees, I glimpsed short reddish curls slipping from beneath a baseball cap. 

His features were kind, though a sardonic twist lingered in his lips. 

I could tell that, once, this boy had laughed. Maybe even been the class joker.

It was hard to look at him without noticing the gnarly scar that sliced below his left eye and cut across his nose. 

He lifted a hand in a sarcastic wave. “Thanks for biting me,” he muttered. Sam’s British accent was a lot stronger now that he wasn’t whispering. “Twice.”

Ignoring him, I shuffled over to Bobby. Her nosebleed was getting worse, I thought, and I knew what that led to. 

But when I gingerly grazed the tips of my fingers under my own nose, I realized I was no longer bleeding. Not just that, the thunderclap headaches that had sent my thoughts spiraling were gone.

When I crouched in the dirt and pulled Bobby to my chest, Clara knelt beside me. “I’d keep your distance,” she said softly. “Right now, that’s not who you think it is.”

I got to my feet, struggling to stay upright. “Then who, or what, is she?”

“Right now?” Sam shrugged. “A defecting soldier.” He jutted his chin. “Just like your mate.”

“No,” I said, even when yes burned on my tongue. “No, she wouldn’t—”

“He’s right, Adeline,” Clara murmured. When I turned to look at her, her smile had curved into a frown. She folded her arms across her chest. “You need to understand that right now, that isn’t Robyn Atwood. At least, it won’t be until she dies.”

“What?” I whispered, a chill creeping down my spine. “What are you talking about?”

The two of them exchanged glances, and after what looked like a telepathic conversation between them, Clara sighed.

“Adeline, she’s going to be okay,” she said softly. “As long as her Zero is active, she’s fine.”

My hand grazed the back of my neck, and I was reminded of the thing inside me.

Mr. Fuller had called it that, a Zero. Whatever was inside Nick and Bobby. The entirety of my class.

Sam groaned and flopped onto the ground, picking up a stick and snapping it in half. 

Pulling resting his head in his arms, he sighed, a small, unguarded gesture that revealed the boy still inside him, the one who had been forced to grow up too fast. 

“Oh, boy.” Sam shot Clara a crooked smile, resting his chin on his knee. “You're better at explaining. You know I suck at describing shit.” 

Clara nodded. “Fine.” 

She plopped down next to him, her dark brown eyes tracing the sky above us, distant and wistful. 

“I guess we should start from the beginning.” 

Her smile was bright, but her eyes betrayed her; she did not want to revisit what came next. 

“Like you, Adeline,” she said quietly, “I was a defect.”

She tilted her chin toward Sam. “We both were. They said my brain couldn’t handle it.”

The bottom dropped out of my stomach. Suddenly I was back in the facility, my head pounding, blood dripping down my chin, my hand tangled in Nick’s. 

*Her brain couldn’t handle it*, Mr. Fuller had said with that smug smile.

Clara’s throat-clearing snapped me back. Her eyes had darkened. 

Her head tipped back,  gaze flicking to the cloudless sky. “You already know the gist of it, so I won’t go into detail. Mr Fuller, my mother, and everyone I've ever known…” she sniffled, squeezing her eyes shut. “They killed my friends.” 

Her voice wavered. “There were thirty-six seniors in our class, and we’re the only ones who made it out.”

She steepled her fingers, a small, habitual motion that looked like something she did to keep herself from falling apart. Clara was her own anchor. 

She pulled her knees to her chest, all of her trembling, like she was back there. 

“They lined us up. Like you, we were just kids thinking we were at some kind of summer camp.” She shot me a grin. “I saw you that day.” Clara’s eyes filled with tears. 

“Adeline Calstone watching me from the shadows. I didn't want to scare you. You were a kid, and I guess…” Clara let out a breath. “I guess part of me figured maybe summer camp wouldn't be so bad.” 

I revelled in the way she held herself together; a paper doll, fragile, fraying at the edges. But refusing to tear. “So, I let the teacher grab me.”

For a moment, I thought she would manage to tell her story without breaking.

“I had a boyfriend,” Clara whispered. Her eyes were faraway again. Lingering on the trees. “His name was Jonas.” Clara's tone splintered, breaking into a hiss. 

“He was standing next to me. Jonas, my first love. My first kiss. He was my first everything. We planned to take a year out, travel the world. See every country. Make memories before going to college on opposite sides of the world.” 

Clara exhaled shakily. “I didn’t even have time to process it. One moment, Jonas had his arms around me, promising we’d escape. His head was on my shoulder, and he was screaming. He told them to stop, told them he surrendered.”

I watched her body jerk, her fingers trailing up and down her arm, like she could still feel him.

“The next, I was covered in his blood. Jonas was everywhere. He was in my hair, I could taste him in my mouth.” 

Clara giggled. She was breathless suddenly, grasping onto Sam’s arm, squeezing until he murmured to her. “Jonas tasted like spaghetti sauce, and he felt like nothing.” Her voice cracked. 

“His brains were pooling beside me, Adeline, and they didn’t care. They just kept killing my friends.”

Her voice broke into a cry. “I begged them. I told them to fucking kill me too.”

“Hey.” Sam’s eyes were soft. “Hey, take it easy. What did we say? Not all at once.”

Clara nodded. “I’m okay.”

The girl sniffled, wiping at her nose. “Two of the soldiers were talking. I was the only one left standing. They were already ordering the others to start disposing of the bodies, and in that moment, I realized I had only two choices: stay and wait to die, or take a chance and run for my life.” 

Her smile was haunted. “I ran. I ran from them. Jonas, Liv, and Isabelle. I watched them drag away the bodies of my friends. Then I followed the others, the blues and purples, into the facility.”

Her relief was mine too. Sitting in that uncomfortable silence following her retelling the murder of her friends, was overwhelming. “That’s when I found Sam.” She drew in a shaky breath.

“Sam was alive. He was dragged right off the bus when he punched a teacher in the face, and knocked out.” 

Clara let out a short, bitter laugh. “He was always getting into fights at school. I guess this time it saved him. They drugged him so he wouldn’t wake up and just threw him on the floor.” 

She sniffled again. “Sam was barely responsive, lying in a pile of our dead friends. But he was okay. He wanted to go back, wanted to take all of them out. Get our revenge.” She shot him a watery grin. 

“Let’s just say Sam was pretty vocal under some serious anesthesia.” Clara’s smile faded. “I took a chance. Sam was the only one left, the only red that survived, and I lifted him into my arms and ran.”

Sam nodded, tracing his scar. He was smiling. “Princess Clara Danvers, who teased me in sophomore year, had saved me.” He pointed at himself. “Me. The damsel in distress.”

His smile curled. “You did drop me twice, though. I’m blaming my sudden influx of headaches on you.”

Clara gave him a playful shove, and comforted by her presence, he shifted closer, letting her rest her head on his shoulder. Sam leaned in, reaching for her hand. On the surface, they didn’t match: freak and valedictorian, outcast and princess. 

But somehow, they fit. 

I could see exactly what Sam was doing, making it easier for her to tell their story. 

I wondered if he was all Clara needed to stay afloat, to keep her breathing, to keep her head above water, just like Nick had been for me. 

When I lost Bobby, when she was taken inside to be processed, I had clung to Nick with everything I had. 

“Anyway,” Clara said, wringing her hands in her lap. “We got out.” She gestured behind her. 

“There’s nothing back there but a dead end. A ravine. Back then, we thought…” Her voice choked. 

“We thought it was the best choice. My mom wasn’t real. My family. My town. None of it was. It was all a setup for some messed-up experiment. We were completely alone. Nobody was coming for us and if they were, it was only for our fucking body parts.""

Clara's gaze found the dirt. 

""Eventually, Mom found us. She told me they wanted my heart to give to some kid in the real world. She said they had to take it while it was still healthy, before my body started rejecting the program. They wanted Sam’s organs for a full transplant.” 

Her hand went to her chest. 

“It was my heart,” she said softly, and I couldn’t help but notice her use of the past tense. “I didn’t care if I wasn’t supposed to be real, if we were just skins and pretty faces for their soldiers, and I was nothing but body parts ready for donation. They weren’t taking me. And they weren’t taking Sam.”

I was hit with a wave of realization. “You jumped.”

Sam nodded. “Wouldn't you?"" 

“The ravine wasn’t what we were expecting,” Clara said softly. “We expected to.. well, we expected to die.”

Sam leaned back on his elbows with a sigh. “Imagine our surprise when we didn’t get obliterated on sharp rocks and ended up in the sea.” 

His laugh was easy, and I found myself drawn to it, a welcome distraction from their story. 

“Yeah, that’s right,” he added, tipping his head back and frowning at the sky. 

“Aceville’s an island. Those psychos bought it and built it to look exactly like a normal American town.”

I waited for Clara to continue, but her gaze seemed distant. Sam, noticing, took over. 

“Anyway,” he said, glancing at her, his eyebrows knitting together with concern. 

“Since we weren’t that far out, we swam to shore. And it turns out there’s an entire place built for this experiment. The people running it live there with their families, including kids, teenagers, and the elderly. It’s a whole community devoted to creating us.” 

“Aceville soldiers are made here and then sent off to train as the country’s top defense.” He chuckled. “They really trust eighteen-year-old, brainwashed super soldiers with the nuclear codes.”

Clara shoved him. “Shush.” She rolled her eyes at me before continuing. 

“We found an old abandoned house. I think it was here long before they built the research facility or the apartment blocks for the workers’ families.” Her expression darkened. “But we were dying,” Clara whispered. “We were vomiting blood, with headaches like thunderclaps. Bleeding out of every orifice–”

“Clara.” Sam rolled his eyes. “I've just had my lunch.” 

She elbowed him. “We were too weak to find food or water, so that night we just lay on bug-infested floorboards, waiting to die. The roof had caved in, so we could see the stars.” The girl smiled faintly. 

“It was… pretty. Peaceful. Painful. I remember having to gag my screams, rolling back and forth as my body bled out. But it was so *human*, and I would give anything to feel it again.” 

Clara's voice faltered. “That night, I knew I was going to die. I told Sam I loved him. I fell asleep knowing my heart was still in my chest and that it was still mine.”

Her eyes glistened with tears. “I was at peace knowing I could die far away from that awful place.”

“And surprise, surprise?” Sam sent me a smirk.

I frowned at him. “You didn’t?” I caught myself. “You didn’t die, I mean.”

He shook his head. “Oh no, we did.”

His words sent my thoughts into a tailspin.

“I don’t understand.”

“Duh.” The boy’s smile was teasing. “Haven’t you worked it out yet? We died.” He threw a branch at me. “You see dead people.”

“Ignore him.” Clara turned and prodded him in the cheek.

“Ow.” His response was more sarcastic than pained.

“But he’s not wrong.” Clara gave me a weak, uneasy smile. “First of all, it’s not technically dying,” she said. 

“Think of it more like rebooting. The defections did kill us, yes, but we were brought back. The thing in our necks, what they call a Zero, was implanted for one purpose. Humans naturally die, right? We all have an expiration date.”

She drew idle circles in the dirt. “Aceville soldiers don’t. Not because of who we are, but because of what they made us for. If we’re shot in the head, we come back minutes later, stronger than before.""

""Mr. Fuller was right. They strip away our humanity so it doesn’t hurt. When you die and come back enough times, it stops mattering. In a way, it’s merciful, the mind control, I mean. It dulls everything.""

Something was wrong. I realized it too late. 

I should have seen it earlier, when Bobby was squeezing the breath from my lungs, and somehow, I still had breath left to take.

“That’s what happened to you.”

Clara’s voice softened. “Earlier, when you were defecting, you died, Adeline. It happened to Sam and me, and to the few kids we’ve managed to save. We’re rare cases, those who defect and come back before they can incinerate us.”

Her tone hardened. “That’s why they get rid of us the moment our brains start to turn.”

“Because we’ll rise again,” Sam added. “Trust me, it’s not as Hollywood blockbuster as you think. In the movies people come back in seconds. Initially, it takes a while for us to fully revive. You took nearly an hour.” He offered a smirk. 

“We don’t eat brains, so stop looking at me like that. No superpowers, unfortunately. We’re like Captain America before he was made into Captain America.”

“But…” I was struggling to take in his words. All I could see were my own fingers slick with Nick’s blood, and the tiny device I’d crushed between my index and forefinger. “My… my friend—”

He cut me off. “Your mate Nick? Well, as for the others, it’s a different story. He was a success initially, before he defected, so yeah, he’s nothing like our lame asses. They’ve definitely upgraded their programming. Nick’s more of a Black Widow, I’d say. The kid’s got moves.” 

Sam caught my eye, his lip curving into a pout. 

“Sorry. I know I should be relieved that my brain can’t compute with the program, but come on, I want superpowers too.”

“They’re not superpowers,” Clara said stiffly.

Sam shrugged. “And since their programs didn’t work on us, we kept our minds, rendering us walking corpses.""

Their words didn’t feel real.

I was dead.

No, I thought, even when I knew they were right. I had stopped bleeding. Stopped defecting. The headaches were gone.

“No,” I heard myself say. “No, I’m alive.”

Though it came out more like a question.

Clara’s smile was sad. “That’s what I thought too,” she said. “Until I…” She trailed off, her hand pressing over her chest.

I wanted to copy her, I wanted to, but I couldn’t. If I did, if I placed my hand over my heart and felt nothing, I’d start screaming and never stop.

My mind snapped back to Kenji Leonhart, his body draped over a soldier’s back. The blood running down the back of his shirt. He wasn’t a red.

Which meant he was a blue or a purple, one of the first to defect, one of the first kids who wasn’t a red to be incinerated.

If only Nick and I had gone back for him. Then we might have been able to save him. But how could we have known? How could we have known that he’d come back?

I couldn’t help it. My eyes were stinging, but the tears didn't come.

“Am I even human?”

Clara grabbed Sam’s hand and squeezed. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “I haven’t felt my heartbeat in so long. And yet I age. I can smell and taste. Eating and sleeping are hard. I can only manage coffee right now, but I don’t get tired. I should feel human, right?”

She tried to smile. “It’s like my body is pretending to be alive so I don’t freak out. I can breathe, but it doesn’t feel natural when I pay attention to inhaling and exhaling.” She sighed. “Really, it’s cruel. I feel synthetic pain, but it’s not real pain.”

She laughed, though it came out choked. “I guess the device is supposed to mimic real human pain, though I don’t understand why they’d do that to a bunch of brain-dead super soldiers. We’re supposed to be mindless. Most of the time, I can deal with it. But it never goes away.”

The girl lay her head on Sam’s shoulder again, grasping for his hand, and I felt that connection between them. 

“That feeling, Adeline. Knowing I’m dead, knowing the only thing keeping me going is the device in the back of my neck and the program in my brain that doesn’t work. My body’s a puppet, and without it, I’d drop dead for real.”

“Is there a way to… stop it?” I managed to get out.

“Defecting?” Sam shrugged.  “I’ve never seen a kid recover.” He jutted his chin at Bobby. “Your friend’s got a better chance with a real doctor on the mainland.”

“How long does she have?”

“Judging from her nose, I’d say it’s early defection. Maybe a few hours.”

“Nick.” Something cold slithered through me. I shakily got to my feet. “I took it out of him. Does that mean…”

Sam whistled. “Without that freaky revival device, the kid is a *kid*. A mind-controlled kid with some serious Captain America specs. If Fuller hasn’t noticed and your friend defects, he’ll stay dead.”

Clara’s tone was a warning. “Sam.”

“What?” Sam groaned. “Do you want me to sugarcoat it? Tell her the Castor boy is perfectly fine, and it's all rainbows and fuckin’ sunshine?”

The ground suddenly felt strange, like I was walking on air. 

“I promised him,” I managed to choke out. “I… I promised him I wouldn’t let him become one of those things. I said we were going to get out of here. All three of us.”

*“He is… valuable to us.”*

Bobby’s voice sliced through me.

Her body was rattling on the ground, and she was spitting blood. 

When I rolled her onto her back, her expression was blank, but her eyes were open. 

The eyes I’d fallen in love with.

I lurched back, her flickering gaze lazily followed mine.

*“Hand yourself in.”* Bobby’s tone was exactly like Nick’s, drained of everything I loved about her.

“It’s okay.” Clara’s voice was soft. “She’s defecting. She’s not a threat.”

“So, wait, is that like some kind of telepathy shit?” Sam’s eyes snapped to me. “How did she do that?” 

“Bobby.” I knelt next to her. “It’s… it’s going to be okay.” I expected tears to come, but they didn’t.

I pressed a kiss to her forehead, catching Clara’s eye. “You spoke of a mainland. Can you get us there?”

She nodded. “Sam and I have been living on the mainland. Every year we come back and try to save as many as possible, then smuggle them back home.”

“How many?” I held her gaze, but she refused to meet my eyes.

“Twelve. Including you.”

“Only twelve?”

Sam’s laugh was harsh. “We only got two last year. 2017 and 2018 were our best. We saved as many as we could, but those bastards always win.”

“Just you two?”

Clara hummed. “Our first mistake was trusting people.”

“Yeah.” Sam ran a hand through his hair. “Waking up washed up on a beach with a rapidly mending hole in my forehead and seaweed in my mouth taught us that. 

""Strangers, no matter how nice they seem, will fucking kill you. We have to be careful on the mainland. One mention of Aceville gets you a frontal lobotomy or your ass tied to a chair and tortured.”

Sam’s words were bouncing around my skull, but I wasn’t registering them. I was already thinking about Nick. He was still in that building.

“Give me an hour,” I said, my tongue in ties. “I’ll get Nick, and you’ll save them, right? Both of them.”

Clara’s expression was sympathetic. “If his device has been taken out and he’s defecting…”

I didn’t want to hear it. “He’s my best friend. He’s still alive, and they’re not going to let him die. They need him.” I choked. “We can save him. Outside Aceville.""

Sam scowled, but after a moment, his expression softened. “Jessica Hart,” he murmured. “2018. She was processed, but we managed to save her. Pure determination, man. I’d never seen anything like it. That girl’s grip on her own mind was steely.”

“If there’s a chance that part of your friend held on, and they haven’t thrown him in the incinerator already…” He sent me a look. “It’s a shot in the dark, but is it really worth it? What if your friend’s body is down there, or they’ve chopped him up…”

“Sam!” Clara squeaked. “Inside voice!”

“Yes.” I spoke without thinking. “He’s still in there. I know he is.”

Sam looked skeptical before sighing. “Fine. One hour.” He nodded to Clara. “Go with her. I’ll look after the defecting blondie.”

“You’re not immortal,” he said when they hugged. 

I wanted that. I wanted Nick’s arms around me, his fingers tangled in mine. I just wanted my best friend. I wanted him, and I wanted Bobby back by my side.

“They can’t kill you,” Sam pulled something from his jacket and pressed it into her hand. “Point and shoot. Even if you’re a lousy shot.” He offered her a grin, and she rolled her eyes, shoving him.

“Shut up.”

Clara grabbed and squeezed my hand, and before I knew it, she was dragging me back to the clearing, back to where Nick was either dead or alive. I already knew what I was going to do when I found Fuller.

Clara held my arm tightly, her fingernails digging into my skin.

I trusted her steps, her murmured reassurances. She was surprisingly good with the gun, taking out the two guards at the front of the facility at point-blank range without hesitation.

After shooting the guards outside, she grabbed my arm again, keeping a steely grip, and dragged me through the entrance. 

To my surprise, the corridors were empty. Stuffing her pistol down the waistband of her pants, Clara led me down the hallway, moving with slow, cautious steps. I stayed quiet as we climbed the stairs.

I kept having flashbacks to the night before, when I had lost Nick. 

When he had been dragged away, and I couldn’t save him. His words were still rumbling in the back of my mind, echoing in my skull: “Don’t let me become a white picket fence freak,” he had gasped.

“Promise me, Addie!”

And I had promised him.

I had promised him with my last breaths under the stars, waiting for my heart to stop. I had promised him when he had been dragged away to be reprogrammed. Just thinking about him, about my best friend, about saving his mind, made me stagger, struggling to keep up with Clara. 

When we reached the second floor, she stopped at a door and pressed her face against it. 

It felt strange. The last time I had been on this corridor, my filthy feet had pressed against perfect marble flooring, my breath thin, barely fluttering through my lips, and pain. I had been in so much pain, the kind that made me want to die.

Now, all of that was gone. And I craved it. I craved the desperation that had made me feel alive in the first place. Instead, I was numb. Dead flesh.

“If Fuller’s going ahead with Nick’s programming, he should be in one of the rooms downstairs.” Clara pushed the handle down and the door opened. 

“First, though, we’re going to make a quick detour.”

The way she held the handle, knuckles white around the silver steel, told me that whatever was in that room, it meant something to her. 

Meant something to Sam.

“What’s in there?” I asked.

Clara frowned, her lip curling slightly. “Addie, if it’s too much—”

“No,” I said. “I’m okay.”

She shot me a look, the kind Mom gave me when I bought a Sabrina the Teenage Witch comic in eighth grade. Disapproving.

Clara was five years older than me, and she was already like the big sister I had never had.

The room we stepped into wasn’t a programming room. I would have recognized the machines Nick had talked about, the ones I had seen before, blades, saws, knives tainted red. I will never get that image out of my head.

Inside this room, though, what I saw was worse. Clara moved toward a pile on the pristine white floor. As I followed, I realized it wasn’t clothes she was looking at.

They were bodies, my classmates, piled on top of each other. Purple and blue rings stained their shirts, and their gray, lifeless faces stared up with eyes frozen wide in horror. Blood spattered across them, deep red that had long since dried to a dark, crusted brown.

For a moment, I couldn’t move. My mind was trapped, replaying the scene, watching them fall one by one, shot right in front of me.

But I didn’t scream. I didn’t cry. I just stood there, waiting for pain that never came.

Clara moved among them like a frantic insect until she finally straightened up. Her expression broke into a smile I couldn’t understand. Why did she look so hopeful when all I could see was red?

“They’re okay,” she gasped. Maybe she was crying or trying to. It was hard to tell. She pointed to each body as if she recognized them, but she didn’t. Clara didn’t know Elodie McIntire or Tommy Chambers.

I tried to see them as they once were, as people, as friends, but I couldn’t. Something was wrong. Something was off.

Before I could take it all in, Clara’s hands were on my shoulders, gently pushing me back. I knew what I was doing. I was looking for Nick. I was always looking for him, even when I didn’t want to find him.

But it wasn’t Nick. It wasn’t Nick, and I should have felt relieved. I should have been glad.

“Addie,” Clara whispered. “Hey, don’t look, okay? It’s better if you don’t look.”

But I couldn’t not look. I couldn’t not see that pieces of them were missing, like incomplete jigsaw puzzles. Clara was laughing. I think she was. Her smile lit up her face, but her eyes were far too haunted for me to believe it.

“They still have their zeros! Addie, they’re going to be okay. They’re going to reboot.”

I swallowed thickly, forcing my gaze away from the piles of bodies, from Tommy and Elodie.

“They’re freshly dead,” Clara explained. “When we get Nick, we’re bringing them too. We can save so many.” She checked the backs of their necks. “Their zeros are still installed and active. They’re going to be okay.”

She kept saying it.

They’re going to be okay.

I wanted to ask how that was possible, when they had been hacked apart, when legs and arms were missing, skin cruelly stitched back together. 

But I couldn’t help feeling the slightest tinge of hope when looking at Clara right then.

“Sam is going to be ecstatic,” she whispered, grasping my arm for dear life. 

In that moment, she was my anchor, keeping me stable, keeping me afloat. 

I wouldn’t think about Nick or the gruesome scene in front of me twisting my gut into knots.

“Every year he blames himself when we can’t rescue as many kids as possible.”

Clara’s gaze dropped to the ground, her voice splintering.

“He goes into this state where he just sits there staring into space. None of us can get him out of it. When we first started saving kids, and ultimately losing them, he said it’s cruel. The zeros are cruel.” 

“He said he would rather cut his out than pretend to breathe. But I won’t let him. I know it’s awful to try to force someone to live when they’re not really living, when all they want to do is just end it. Maybe I’m selfish, but I can’t do this without him.""

She shrugged. ""He’s been with me for the past five years, and I can’t imagine a morning or night without his whiny ass.”

“Is he…?” I swallowed the rest of my words.

“No,” she said, but I could tell by the pinch between her brows that I was right.

I should have seen it in his expression, in his sardonic attitude and scowl. 

Clara sighed. “He’s just tired of us losing. Every year, fifty seniors get on that bus, and we end up with only two or three if we’re lucky. Last year was the worst.""

""We lost the entire class, Addie. It nearly drove him over the edge. The thing is, we can’t smoke or drink. Well, we can, but it doesn’t affect us. We can’t taste cigarettes, feel the buzz from alcohol, or experience the euphoria of climax of sex. It feels of nothing.""

I pulled a face, and she surprised me with a laugh.

""We’re not robots!” 

Her expression sobered. “I mean, not *that* kind.” 

Clara grabbed my hands, entangling her fingers with mine. “What do you feel?”

Nothing. 

But I didn't say that. 

As if reading my mind, the girl offered a small smile. “You're already thinking like a soldier. You want to say my hand is clammy and my temperature is fluctuating. You can sense every nerve ending, and, if you push hard enough, you can read my thoughts.” She let go, immediately, and that connection crumbled. I was cold again. 

“Everything humans have to take the ache away, even if it’s just temporary, we don’t have that. We just pretend we do. Even our pain is superficial.” 

Clara’s gaze flicked to the defects. “I know it doesn’t seem like much. But to Sam, it’s everything. That scar on his face? Yeah, he did that. When we lost all those kids, he tried to hurt himself.”

Her words whirled around my mind as I tried to register them, trying to understand that Sam didn’t want to pretend to live anymore. And if he felt like that, would that thought ever cross my mind too? 

Would pretending to live without real feelings drive me crazy?

Something caught my eye, pulling me from my thoughts. 

There was movement on the other side of the room, and I couldn’t help myself.

I stumbled to a metal table where a body lay under harsh white light.

Because I have ADHD, I was the queen of dopamine snacking, I’d run on coffee and sugar all day just to survive my work marathons, only to crash and binge at night.

Seeing these stats makes me realize that we aren't just lazy. Our environment is basically designed to make us fail. Between the hidden sugars in everything and the high-stress jobs, willpower alone is a losing strategy.

What finally helped me break out of that cycle and get down to 134lbs this year wasn't a sudden burst of discipline. It was admitting that I’m human and I needed a real system to navigate the madness. I stopped winging it and followed a roadmap that focused on high-satiety meals and mental resets so I didn't have to ""think"" when I was tired.

So, I noticed this little dark brown spot today on the front of the tooth of the first 3 photos and I'm sort of scared because I went to the dentist only a few days ago where they took x-rays (I unfortunately don't have the x-rays) and I was told I'd need a filling for the cavity in the last 2 photos but no other fillings or anything. The dentist was mainly focused on the side of my mouth where the cavity im getting filled is, but he only briefly looked at the other side (which is where the tooth with the brown spot is), he also didn't discuss any of the x-ray with me in the appointment, hence why I'm worried. There's also a tiny little brown spot on the top of the first tooth, but it won't show on camera.

There's been slight sensitivity on that first tooth but no sensitivity on the main cavity oddly enough.

Whenever I go into a book store these things trouble me a lot. 

1. Prices being 30 to 40 percent higher than amazon almost always. 
If a books 650 at Amazon it will be 1300 at the book store. That's my first major issue. 


2. Even after ignoring this price problem. 
If I go for reading looking at the books enjoying it and maybe would like to buy it. The uncle comes and scolds you to not read books as if this is the most inappropriate place in the world to read books either they won't even let you search for the book you want an constantly irritate you with 
What do you want just tell us hey what are you looking for like bro calm down it's been 2 minutes. 

And sometimes if I want to check if a books too tough for me or if I enjoy it enough or want to read 3 to 4 pages before buying it you're instantly told to either buy and not read. 


This literally does not happen In any other country I am not even lying. When I go out with my dad I literally sit in bookstores all day long they have sofas everyones nice to me I get free coffee always and sometimes they share food with me as well. And this is when I've told them that I won't and can't buy anything at all they don't look at me with bad eyes or as if I have done something wrong never ask me to leave don't get sad or rearrange books because I am reading them. They don't even ask me to stack them back they say we can do that ourselves. 


That's the problem with bookstore owners back home if I just wanted to get a book go out fast not enjoy anything at all I would order it online for half the price. 


These guys would rather sit in an empty shop not making sales rather than let someone sit and read books. 


The voice is so irritating when I was checking out a book to know what's it about literally just picked it up. 

Hey mister no reading allowed don't read in such a rude tone as well. 

Why would someone even go to you guys man like you guys are the reason no one goes to bookstores anymore and buy online at a cheaper price. Thats why your business is closing down from when we used to see a bookstore at every railway station and every street to them being rare to see. 

And ofc some bookstores in gurgaon hyderabad are just the exact opposite. Guys who actually tell me to not buy anything from them for now as I'm not yet earning and tell me to read books here so that I don't spend my family money and can read the books. 


But even guys like these get their reputation bad due to the above guys who think that books and grocery sell the same. Come get it go out nothing to see at all. And people don't get in the bookstores or try to read. ",1,1767468967.0,Indianbooks,1,0.67,False

1q33r41,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenStack/comments/1q33r41/is_the_koolatron_mini_fridge_worth_it_for_skin/,Is the Koolatron Mini Fridge Worth It for Skin Care and Drinks?,"Picked up the Koolatron KRT04 to mess around with on my workbench and then ran it like a normal person would, desk in the office for a while, then a few trips in the truck. Design and aesthetics are the big sell here: that retro look in pink with the chrome accents is honestly kinda sharp, and I get why people buy it as a bedroom mini fridge or dorm mini fridge just for the vibe. Price wise it sits in that middle zone where you expect better than the no name mini cooler junk, but it’s not built like a real compressor compact refrigerator either.

Compactness and portability are legit. It’s small enough to fit on a shelf, and the flip up carry handle helps. Handle and door security is decent thanks to the twist-to-open handle, though I can see why one reviewer had a handle piece snap off; the plastic feels a little “don’t drop me” flimsy. Build quality is light, not rugged.

Cooling efficiency is thermoelectric, so keep expectations real. It cools up to about 32F below ambient, meaning in a cool room your soda cans and coffee creamer get nicely chilled, but in a hot car it’s fighting physics. Temperature consistency was ok in my cooler basement office, less steady in the garage on a warm day. Car and dorm suitability is the main win since it runs on both 12V DC and 110V AC, so power options versatility is there out of the box.

Noise levels were mostly quiet, a soft fan hum, though I did catch an odd clunk once. Energy consumption on paper is not tiny for what you get (thermoelectric units can be sneaky that way), and you’ll see some condensation. Water forming inside is real, so maintenance and cleaning means wiping it out and doing manual defrost-ish upkeep.

Reliability over time is where I get sceptical. Multiple folks had it die in 3 to 5 months, one with a loud pop, another said sparks out the back. Customer support experience sounds decent since replacements got shipped under the one year warranty, but I still would not trust this mini fridge for medication storage unless you’re monitoring temps, same for insulin or anything critical. Fit for skincare and medicine is fine for creams and serums, just not mission critical meds IMO.

1q33qig,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1q33qig/why_motivation_dies_and_discipline_is_the_only/,Why MOTIVATION Dies and DISCIPLINE Is the Only Way Out: The Psychology That Actually Works,"So here's something I noticed after spending way too much time researching self improvement stuff. Everyone's chasing motivation like it's this magic pill that'll fix everything. We watch inspirational videos, read quotes, get hyped up for like 48 hours, then crash back to square one. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt.

After diving deep into research from behavioral psychology, neuroscience, and honestly just observing people around me, I realized we've been looking at this whole thing backwards. Motivation isn't the solution. It's actually the problem.

Let me break down what's actually happening in your brain and share some practical tools that helped me (and the research backs this up).

# The brutal truth about motivation

Motivation is an emotion. And emotions are temporary by definition. Stanford psychologist BJ Fogg, who literally runs the Behavior Design Lab, explains that relying on motivation is like trying to catch smoke with your hands. Some days you feel it, most days you don't.

Your brain's dopamine system gets desensitized really quickly. That's why the motivational speech that gave you goosebumps last week does nothing for you today. You're essentially building your entire productivity system on quicksand.

The actual fix? Discipline. Which sounds boring as hell, but hear me out.

# What discipline actually looks like

Discipline isn't about willpower or being some superhuman robot. It's about building systems that work even when you feel like garbage.

**Start stupidly small.** James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits (bestselling book, over 15 million copies sold, this guy knows his stuff). The book completely changed how I think about behavior change. He breaks down the science of why tiny habits compound into massive results. Instead of ""I'm gonna work out for an hour,"" make it so easy you can't say no. Put on your gym shoes. That's it. The barrier to entry has to be laughably low. This book will make you question everything you think you know about building habits. Seriously one of the best self improvement books out there.

**Use environmental design.** Your environment is constantly nudging your behavior in ways you don't notice. If your phone is next to your bed, you'll scroll. If healthy food is visible in your fridge, you'll eat it. Shape your space so the good choice is the easy choice. Remove friction from good habits, add friction to bad ones.

**The two-minute rule works.** Any new habit should take less than two minutes to do. Not ""read more,"" but ""read one page."" Not ""start a business,"" but ""write one sentence of the business plan."" Once you're in motion, continuing is way easier than starting.

# Why your brain fights you

Here's what nobody tells you. Your brain is literally wired to resist change. The prefrontal cortex (the part handling self control) is expensive to run, energy wise. Your brain would rather rely on autopilot because it's efficient.

Dr. Wendy Wood at USC studies habit formation. She found that about 43% of what we do daily is habitual. Your brain loves patterns because they save energy. So when you try to change, you're fighting against biology. That's why it feels so hard. It's not a personal failing, it's just how brains work.

The good news? You can hijack this system. Once a behavior becomes automatic, it stops requiring willpower. That's the whole game. You're not trying to maintain motivation forever, you're trying to make discipline automatic.

**Use implementation intentions.** This is research backed psychology. Instead of ""I'll exercise more,"" use ""After I drink my morning coffee, I'll do ten pushups."" The ""if/then"" format creates a mental trigger. Your brain starts connecting the cue to the action automatically.

# Tools that actually help

**Fabulous app** is legitimately good for building routines. It's based on behavioral science research and guides you through establishing habits in a structured way without being preachy. The interface doesn't feel like homework, and it breaks everything into manageable chunks.

**BeFreed** is an AI-powered learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. Built by Columbia University grads and former Google engineers, it generates custom podcasts based on what you're actually trying to improve. You can choose between quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples.

What makes it useful is the adaptive learning plan it creates around your specific goals, and you can customize the voice to match your mood, like something energetic for workouts or calm for evening listening. The virtual coach avatar lets you pause mid-podcast to ask questions or get clarifications, which helps when concepts don't click immediately.

**The Obstacle Is The Way by Ryan Holiday** (Wall Street Journal bestseller, this guy studied Stoic philosophy for years and makes it actually applicable). This book teaches you to reframe resistance as the path forward, not something blocking you. Every time I want to quit something difficult, I remember the core principle from this book. Insanely good read if you struggle with giving up when things get hard.

**Make It Stick** by cognitive scientists Peter Brown, Henry Roediger, and Mark McDaniel. They spent decades researching how learning actually works versus how we think it works. The strategies in here apply to building any skill, not just academic stuff. Your intuition about how to learn is probably wrong, and this book proves it with research.

# The compound effect nobody talks about

Small consistent actions create nonlinear results. You don't see progress for weeks, then suddenly everything clicks. Most people quit right before the breakthrough because they don't understand this curve.

Cal Newport calls this ""deep work"" in his book. The ability to focus without distraction is becoming rare, which makes it valuable. But you can't deep work your way into discipline on day one. You build up to it by showing up repeatedly, even when the sessions suck.

Think about it like this. If you improve by just 1% daily, you're 37 times better after a year. The math is stupid simple but the execution is where everyone fails. Because it requires showing up when you really, really don't want to.

# What to do starting now

Pick ONE thing. Not five. One behavior you want to make automatic. Make it so small it feels ridiculous. Do it at the same time every day. Don't track anything else, don't add more goals, just nail this one thing for 30 days.

Your brain will try to negotiate. ""Maybe tomorrow."" ""I'm too tired."" ""This isn't working fast enough."" That's just the prefrontal cortex trying to conserve energy. Expect it, don't fight it, just do the thing anyway.

Motivation is a spark. Discipline is the fuel system. Stop waiting to feel ready and start building the system that works whether you feel ready or not.",1,1767468722.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

Most of this is explanation as lead up to what happened last night.

I don't even know how to really capture all of this... But right now I'm feeling angry, hurt, disappointed. Incredibly sad. All at the same time.

To preface, I messed up with my (30m) girlfriend (28f) when she really needed me. Past several months she'd been having some health issues, pain in her abdomen, sometimes vertigo. At the time I thought I was listening to her well, and giving her the support she needed. My approach in the past has always been to try to be present and listen to someone, and to distract them from whatever stuff they're going through. Of course, I've learned through all of this that I need to be more nuanced, to be better at listening, to elicit more from my partner and do better to understand what they're feeling.

That said, she went in for some tests mid-Novmber. I've been kicking myself since, but the day of, I texted her asking how the tests went. I should have called. Needless to say, I wasn't engaging her feelings in the way she needed, and she got upset. And continuing through the text conversation, I kept putting my foot in my mouth. She got even more upset.

The next day I asked to come see her, she said yes. But getting to her house, she was still incredibly upset at me, and told me how badly I handled things. Asked me why I handled them this way. Told me that through some of the health stuff she'd been experiencing she felt I had been incredibly dismissive. And seeing it now, while unintentional and meaning well, I was dismissive of her feelings. I wasn't there to support her emotionally when she needed me most. They confirmed that she had an ovarian cyst that had burst. Something that she said that really hurt was ""I'm considering having my dad fly in if I have to get surgery. I can't trust you to be there for me"". 
To make this worse, that same day I was going to be headed on an 11 hour roadtrip to visit my grandma for an extra week before Thanksgiving. Due to all of this, I offered to stay home instead of going. She told me to still go on my trip. That even if surgery was required, it wouldn't happen until I was back from Thanksgiving anyway.

To keep things brief, we talked on the phone a few times over the holiday. Due to certain things I didn't say, once again related to her feelings (I was walking on eggshells here) she got even more upset. Felt like this was a pattern. The day I got home, she talked to me at length about all of this. Told me other things I'd been doing wrong in the relationship. And said that she was considering breaking up with me. She also let me know that surgery was not needed, and that it would be an at home recovery.

We took some time apart. Then after a few days, got together in person again. I apologized more thoroughly, gave her a plan for how I was going to go forward with changing to be the man she needs me to be. She told me a friend had talked to her about everything, and had told her she was holding me to way too high of a standard. This is important for what just happened tonight. But needless to say, I thought we made up. Over the following days I did my best to be supportive. I didn't want to hover, but when she was willing I made her dinner a few times. Helped her around her house. Provided emotional support and did my best to listen to her better and be more conscious of what she's telling me about her feelings. To elicit more from her so I could understand her and so she could feel understood. Of course, I'm still very much learning, I certainly didn't do a perfect job. But I showed up and I tried my best.

Since making up, things have been okay. For the first part of December I felt like we were getting back into pur previous rhythm. But then, the week before Christmas, she barely gave me the time of day. I only saw her on that Friday. We didn't get to spend much tim together that day either, and she seemed incredibly on edge and distant. We had gotten coffee in the morning, and at one point she snapped at me about something when all I was trying to do was relate to her. Then later in the day we'd gotten together again in the evening. She was going to be flying home for Christmas, I was going to be taking her to the airport at 5am. During the evening we were chatting while cleaning her kitchen together, and I commented on the fact I hadn't deep cleaned my kitchen in a while. She made a snide remark as a joke ""yeah what excuse do you have, its not like you had a burst cyst or something"". That threw me off pretty hard. And the nail in the coffin that night. It was 9pm, and she asked if I could kick myself out so we could both go to bed. I asked her ""maybe quick 10 minute cuddles??"" To which she literally gave a flat out no. No explanation, no softening the blow. Just ""no"".

Over Christmas I thought about letting her be the one to call, but a friend had told me to act normally. So, while she was out of town (about 10 days) I called her twice. She sounded like she really didn't want to talk to me, so I kept the conversations short. And what hurt more than anything is my birthday is Dec. 27th. On top of that, my 30th birthday. All I got was a ""happy birthday!! 👴🏼"". Thats it. For context we've been together for 9 months. Thats not the kind of thing I would hope to see from someone who tells me they love me and has been my partner for almost a year.

Upon coming home, she invited me over. This was new years eve? She's sick tho, so I didn't stay long. During some of the convo I asked her ""are we good?"" And she told me that her nervous system has been up any time I've been around, that she's been anxious with me. 

Some important context, in early November she had gotten her birth control taken out. Its the in the arm kind. So, through all of this, she's been going through hormonal withdrawal. Which she told me as part of the reason she's been acting the way she has. She told me the best remedy was for us to spend more time together, as we had barely seen eachother in December.

Now because she's sick, I didn't really get all too far into my own feelings, how all of this has made me feel. I was gonna save that for another day.

___________________________________________

If you're skipping through the body of this post, this is what I actually came to vent about.

Last night hung out. Taking her home, I asked her to clarify: ""so with you saying that your nervous system is up, I want to understand that better. What do you think is mainly causing that?""

Her: ""well its the same thing that we've talked about, you handling my health scare the way you did""

She then mentioned some other stuff thats aside and not as relevant to all of this. Then said, and I fucking quote-

""part of me wishes that you had cheated on me instead of what happened, cuz I feel like I could've rebuilt trust easier with that than what you did”.

I'm just so... at a loss. She's telling me I'm worse than a cheater? And she told me its gonna take a while to rebuild trust. Between this, the other stuff she's told me I've upset her over, I'm getting to the point that I'm afraid to tell her anything at all. I feel like anything I say could either set her off, or be used against me. And that lately, she's been collecting reasons to not like me any more.

Its got me thinking I need to break this off. For her sake, as it seems she's likely going to alway have some level of trust issues with me. And for me, for my own mental health, for my sanity.

Which makes me incredibly sad. Before all this... before it all things were going so amazingly. I'll be honest I've never ever felt this way about someone before. I fell absolutely head over heels for her. I love her. Deeply. I want to go the distance with her, I want to make this work. I want to be someone she feels like she can trust, someone she feels safe with. But based on what she said tonight, thats starting to feel insurmountable. I'm so angry, so devastated, so utterly upset because I thought I had found the person I was going to spend my life with.

Of course, I'm also here for advice. For someone to tell me its okay. Someone who has gone through something similar and has made it out the other side. Perhaps for someone to tell me how much of a hell hormonal withdrawal is and that its not her fault. Or perhaps for someone to tell me to run. I don't know. I just want to fucking cry.

She was crying because she had to spend $400 on glasses. She must live off Brody now because she sure isn’t crying as she gets coffee twice a day. I’d love for her to do “what I spend in a day” videos. She should keep track for one month so she can see she’s spending a fortune on processed food and junk they don’t need. It’s like she doesn’t cook when the man isn’t home.  

And on another side note, I hope Brody is able to marry someone he genuinely loves at some point in his life. Maybe that person will parent properly and help undo all the bad habits she’s created by being lazy and creating such a brat. I think in three more years he’s going to resent her because she’s there to just spend his money and embarrass him with her stupid comments. He looks at the kid lovingly, but not her. 

Maybe she hated his work Christmas party because she can’t have an adult conversation so she’s uncomfortable. Honey girl needs to get in the work force part time, it would be good for her and the kid so he can get some socialization with other littles.

**Time for the recap!** 

**Episode 24:** 

We start the episode with Yusen sending a letter by post, then we quickly cut to Xiguang having a meeting with the PV Garden team. It is the weekend but they’re still hard at work. Mr Hua (one of the colleagues) tells her about a seminar happening Sunday at Soochow University. They ask about what to name the garden and she says ‘Mr Lin already named it Liuguang’

[All the text is just address.](https://preview.redd.it/7f8r8klkn6bg1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fca7e6cfd63428e2fe744660623bc8d30705dd9)

**It’s the weekend, so** Xiguang is on the way to Wuxi. She holds onto the letter as she keeps thinking of all she knows and heard about Yusen’s car crash. 

***Xiguang Inner thoughts: What was crossing his mind when he drove me home that last time and he passed this very spot? because at that point, he was convinced I had lured him here and turned my back on him. He truly believed I was the reason he’d never get to pick up the scalpel again.***

Her thoughts come to an end as she opens the letter. We see the postcards Yusen got on his trip and finally **the letter (***I will post the full text of the letter in the pinned comment****)***. Yusen’s letter tells the details of how he first met Xiguang. As his voice starts narrating the content, the scenes change into a flashback of Ms Yu’s banquet.

**Flashback to Xiguang getting ready for the banquet:** 

Through her conversation with her mom, we learn that Xigua went to Ms Yu’s party on behalf of her mom (who was held up by business). 

https://preview.redd.it/pqhxu69rn6bg1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=726e6ff96c05b6d8faf0a9d6a246f17ec6e7f701

Xiguang arrives looking pretty. She greets the host, explains that her mom is held up by business and the she conveys her apologies and messages. Ms Yu looks for Jiaqi to keep Xiguang company but he is nowhere to be found. (Jiaqi is currently catching up with Yusen).

Xiguang finishes the pleasantries, gets herself a nice plate of food and drinks and decides to idle away for 30 mins before leaving. 

Chengyuan makes his entrance (with NY by his side). The old men sitting behind Xigua gossip about CY’s ‘good friend’. 

[he'll be referred to as Misogynistic Suit or MS](https://preview.redd.it/ncq57jxsn6bg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=522548ee95c55de2197a84ca5ddd5d36fb8b7b63)

This old man in particular insults Jiang Yun, calling her a failure wife, that she wouldn’t let CY have any face even in meetings, that she regretted divorcing him, that she begged to go back to CY but was humiliated and he bets she wasn’t even invited to the banquet. Xiguang listens to all this. Misogynistic Suit then gets up to go greet CY.

Xiguang puts down her glass and goes to confront Misogynistic Suit. Snatching the business card he wanted to give CY out of his hand.

Xigua tears into MS. She reads his business card then says “I can tell you and my dad aren’t close, but the way you were holding court over there was as if you were an old friend of his, as if you had all the business of our family figured out” *you go my darling, let him hear it all!!!* 

MS tries to calm the situation as a misunderstanding but Xigua is undeterred as she goes on “When someone spends their time spinning tales about other people’s families, it makes you wonder about the authenticity of their materials.” She then smoothly brings up his misogynistic remarks, saying that with his views, why does he bother showing up at the banquet of one of the female powerhouses of Wuxi.

**Flashback ends to the rest of Yusen’s letter narration.** 

**Xiguang** sits on the bus thinking back to that moment with Yusen in the wedding. “When did you meet your wife?” and she now realises the significance of his answer. Yusen’s narration is accompanied by his memories of the events. 

[But Xiguang, everything I’ve ever done has always been for you.](https://preview.redd.it/u2b76fq0o6bg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd9249d42205baadf0ff1cb0df4352878b37442)

**Xiguang** seems shaken by all she read and in the next scene we see her enter the house in a flurry of movement, heading straight to her room. 

**Xiguang’s room** 

Xiguang spends some time staring at the letter then picks up her phone and calls Yusen. They are both silent on the call, eventually Xigua speaks firsts. “I got your letter” “hm” “the postcards are pretty” “I am glad you like them” 

*my heart can’t take how soft and pained Yusen's voice sounds, I don’t know how he managed to stay strong, I am just a spectator but my heart breaks for him.* 

She mentions the places he’s been to, asks him when he is coming back. He says he was in Beijing, visiting a medical field senior and that he will be catching the night train express. 

https://i.redd.it/tm7f8r87o6bg1.gif

*I am so emotional over this scene. Xiguang takes the first step despite her anxiousness and Yusen the evergreen that he is asks her if she is sure first. He always wants to make sure that her decisions are made by her alone and not some momentary decision. His voice in this scene hurts me but at the same time I am smiling at the both of them slowly making their way to each other.* 

**Next morning: Xiguang arrives in front of the train station**

Xiguang arrives earlier than planned and decides to go get snacks and waits for him on the platform. 

***Xiguang Inner Thoughts*** as she paces back and forth on the platform***: won’t it be super weird if Lin Yusen sees me waiting right here on the platform? Coming all the way here to meet him might be total overkill. Should I run back to the exit instead?*** 

Inner thoughts are interrupted as the train slows to a stop. Her eyes are looking for Yusen as the train passes by, and the moment she spots him, she goes and hides behind the pillar. Yusen gets off the train but heads in the opposite direction.  

***Xiguang Inner Thoughts: Ah! The exit is the other way!***

We get a cute moment of her following behind Yusen, watching his side profile. Feeling watched Yusen turns around

https://i.redd.it/p4wuab8ao6bg1.gif

She asks Yusen why he told her to wait for him at nine when the train gets earlier, and then is happy to having successfully guessed his thoughts as he replies “I was worried \[If I had said seven\] you’d say, forget it Lin Yusen, I can’t get out of bed that early”

Xiguang smiles, gives him food that she picked on the way. They smile and leave the train station. On to the …

**Coffee Shop**

https://preview.redd.it/3s7rlsico6bg1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c96e76b125e0c39c7d7519d80b0b25b3e070170

She watches his reaction as he eats the Xiaolongbao, and then talks about where they could go after this, mentioning multiple places but Yusen just replies with a “I always thought you’d take me to see the plum blossoms”. *I Pause and clutch at my heart. He said it so sweetly too. Lin Yusen <3.* Xiguang looks at him for a second and then says “Alright! To Mei Garden then”

[she doesn't trust his driving](https://i.redd.it/t4g91mneo6bg1.gif)

As Xiguang is driving, Yusen points out that she missed a turn. She asks him why he didn’t say anything earlier and he counters with “I figured a discredited driver like me had no right to give directions.” Xiguang is left speechless, as she goes to get back on the road, Yusen points out the plum blossom trees saying that there is no need to go any further, this is already a good spot. 

**A Walk Among the Plum Blossoms**

[Their footsteps were synced.](https://preview.redd.it/hho6x5sho6bg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b7e2bad8623f806ad3c12879b001fe93565f7a)

Xiguang brings up the his story and asks him “you believed deep down that I had abandoned you so why did you…” Yusen replies with a simple “I couldn’t help myself”



>“I kept coming up with excuses, maybe Jiaqi didn’t make himself clear, maybe you were too young to face something so heavy so you blocked it out…. Or maybeyou just didn’t know my Chinese name, or that you forgot what I looked like so you never connected me with the person from two years ago. I found so many reasons but every one of them was full of holes. But I forced myself to believe each one of them becaus otherwise how could I let myself pursue you again?”



Xiguang says that he should’ve asked her about the whole thing before pinning it down on her. “Am I really that kind of person?” Yusen counters with a ‘No you’re not’. 

>“But Xiguang I never imagined it could be anyone else but you….. From the very beginning….it never crossed my mind that it wouldn’t be you… I am sorry.” 

>

Xiguang asks him if not for her dad, was he planning on keeping the whole thing to himself forever, he explains that he was planning to confront Jiaqi about it before her dad got in the picture. She asks him why he went so far away these past days.

>“How was I supposed to face you? …..I lived my life believing because of you I’d never pick up the scalpel again, I had finally made peace with that…only to find out…. It was all because of a stranger. Because of a lie. I don’t even know how to process that. My life is nothing but a joke”



He asks her when she first met him, and she replies right after the banquet. His smile is bittersweet as he realises that she met Xu later than him. He tells her that he kept thinking about her words ‘I wish I’d met you first’ He says 

>“I wish I’d had met you later, then I wouldn’t feel this resentment that if it weren’t for this cruel twist of fate we would have been together a long time ago. But….it turns out I met you first” 

Xiguang says ‘We are together from now on’.

https://reddit.com/link/1q33fnw/video/walt7k7oo6bg1/player

They walk back to the car smiling to each other all cutely. Yusen convinces her to let him drive (because she missed a turn) and she asks him if he still wants to go to Mei Garden and he just replies “No plum blossoms will ever top these”

**Episode 25:** 

We start this episode in **the hospital** as we check back in on Kevin. Huaya Squad are visiting. We learn that he is getting discharged soon and that he has retrograde amnesia. There is a brief moment where Xu and Kevin are left alone in the room, and he asks “do you really have no memory of Dr Lin?” Kevin affirms. *Now that our couple is official, and we met much more hate-worthy characters, I can’t help feeling bad for Zhuang Xu. I mentioned it in a discussion before but he is a good hardworking kid, his hesitancy however is his downfall. Not that I blame him much for it anymore, since everyone is shaped by their environment.* 

Xu continues trying to jolt Kevin’s memories to no avail. Chris stands by the door watching the exchange. 

**Back to our darlings in the car**

https://preview.redd.it/ymqsqowro6bg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc9762c956757d925aff97e84e4bf6f6430afc8d

There is a brief moment of silence before Xiguang proposes just going straight to dinner then. *If there is ever a love rival for Yusen in their relationship, it will be food.* Yusen reminds her of the promise of a Nancheng Street food crawl and Xigua jokes about how Yusen remembers all their accounts. She decides to call her mom only for her phone to ring. Her mom called her to ask if she is with Lin? Xigua is surprised but her mom just says ‘I gave birth to you after all’. 

Xiguang tells her mom that she and Yusen are dating, and the mom counters with a “you guys just starting out?” *Their families are as big shippers of the both of them as we are.* Jiang Yun tells her to enjoy dinner and that they’ll talk later. 

After the call, Yusen asks her “since you’ve told your mom, can I go public with this now?” she says no and he replies with an ‘I understand’. Both of them smile. 

**Nanchang Street: Food and Walks are Back in the building!** 

Yusen asks Nie Xiǎojiě to lead the way as he has phone calls to make. He calls Shengyi, invites him to an all out dinner which bill he is splitting with Xiguang. Our quickwitted doctor is quick to grasp his meaning as he says “you went home for chinese new year and came back off the market? That was fast” Yusen is all proud of himself as he says they already met each other’s parents, Shengyi is impressed and Xiguang is embarrassed as she rushes to go inside a Plum Cakes shop. 

https://i.redd.it/1f1uai6xo6bg1.gif

Shengyi asks Yusen to pass the phone to Xiguang, he obliges and our Dr is quick to complain about his friend rubbing their relationship in his face in broad daylight. Xiguang just counters with ‘what, was he supposed to wait until it got dark?” Shengyi is complaining about her taking Yusen’s side, he is still complaining about Yusen being smug and bragging when Yusen puts the call on speaker. 

When Shengyi is done ‘advising’ Xiguang to reconsider her relationship, the latter just mentions that Yusen heard everything. Yusen picks the call back up, they joke some more, confirm vague dinner plans before Shengyi is called back to work, “Flex received, gotta go”

**Nanchang Street : Plum Cakes shop**

Xiguang asks Yusen to pay, then asks him when’s he calling Aunt Sheng. He says ‘No rush, I am not the flashy type”. *I am grinning watching these two banter.* He clarifies that he is dying to brag but his mom is probably still asleep. 

**Nanchang Street : Walk 1**

They eat the cakes with Yusen telling her to just give him the flavors she doesn’t like. *The small little things he does, i love him.* They make plans to go to the Soochow Uni seminar together. She gives him the second cake she tries as she decides she needs to break the news to someone else.

Yusen asks her what’s the deal with the ‘Real Estate Scenery’ comment and she relays the origin of the inside joke: Back when Rui and her were travelling Europe, she reminisced over how none of these sceneries truly belong to her, and Rui replies that one day she’ll find her real estate scenery with her name written all over it. 

**Wuxi New Street:** 

They finish their date, and Xiguang drives him to the station, asking him to pick her up at the Suzhou Railway Station tomorrow afternoon. She tells him to get off before he misses the train but he hands her his hand. She is confused but he clarifies that ‘you told Jiang Rui you would write your name on your real estate scenery”

https://i.redd.it/fu8p85g3p6bg1.gif

**Xiguang’s House:** 

Xigua comes back to her mom waiting for her to spill the whole story. She asks about where they went and Xiguang tells her about all the places they’ve been and even their plans for tomorrow. Jiang Yun fake sulks and Xigua acts all cute to appease her. She asks her “Are you happy with Lin?” and Xiguang is grinning as she replies “Yes”. Jiang Yun conveys her wishes for Xiguang to have the best luck in the world, and Xiguang replies that ‘having you is the best luck in the world”

Soon after they finish the messaging, Xiguang picks her phone again and sends an audio reminding him not to dress corporate. They end up continuing their chatting instead of sleeping. *Their conversations are adorable, I love the reality of the fact that the good nights are never final and that they keep thinking about and messaging each other. Wholesomeness.* 

**Soochow University: Walk 2**

Xiguang is laughing at his hair style, and reaches out to fix it herself. *I’d insert a gif but these episodes recaps I keep wanting to gif every cute moment that I don’t think reddit can keep up. I watch the whole scene giggling.* The both of them are at ease with each other now, as Xiguang fixes his hair and then he naturally takes her by the hand as they head back into uni. They joke all the way into the lecture hall, only to find it full! 

**Soochow University: Lecture Hall**

Xiguang blames Yusen’s hair for being late and how they now have to sit on the ground. Yusen takes off his coat, puts it on the ground for her to sit on, she goes to do the same for him but he just takes her coat in his hands and asks her to share a corner of his coat with him. *I was happy to see her try to return the gesture and even happier to see the both of them cutely sitting so close together.* 

The professor lectures and Yusen and Xiguang listen as thy exchange remarks. *My brain sadly zones out when the whole talk about PV and its market come up, i understand just enough to relate it to the plot and that’s it.* 

**Soochow University: Walk on the campus** 

Xiguang mentions how she told their colleagues about the name of their garden, how Mr Hua said ‘our goal is to catch and keep as much light as possible” and Yusen counters by saying that “Mr Hua is modest, ***my*** goal is capture and keep ***all*** the light”. They talk some more about work and decide to go try the Soochow cafeteria. 

**Soochow University : Meal time**

They banter a bit as they eat, over all having fun. Xiguang rambles on and on about how finally she feels at ease with her work, especially since she started working on the Liuguang Garden. He asks if he’ll get credit but she says that it was just trading one happiness for another. He sighs and replies “It’s so hard to get a compliment from my ***girlfriend”*** 

*aaaaaahhhhhh they are so adorable, the way she is constantly yapping and he is always just looking at her with a smile, how he knows to tease her enough to leave her smiling and grinning.* Xiguang gives him one meat ball as a reward. 

**Shuangyuan Office:**  We see Yin Jie happy with the souvenirs from Yusen. She asks Xiguang if they’re finally together and Xiguang confirms that they are. Episode ends with Yusen smiling at Xiguang as he steps out of his office.

**Some Extra Thoughts:** 

* **The whole walk through plum blossoms in episode 24 just made me grin. I didn’t want to write my thoughts mid-recap to not ‘interrupt’ Yusen’s lines. I am glad we got more insight into his thoughts in these recent episodes. He is even more sweeter, even more tragic. The fact that even after everything, he was still trying to make sure she wants to be together with him out of her own emotions and not some pressure from him. I am so glad they talked out every possible problem ahead of time. Now, we can enjoy the dating era stress free.

I'm visiting San Francisco for two days (Jan 17-18) and would love to grab coffee with anyone who's built a SaaS and acquired customers. I see a lot of young builders in this sub sharing great progress, and I'm totally open to learning from you guys too - age doesn't matter, real experience does. I'm hoping to hear whatever advice you can share on getting started, validating ideas, or growing.

Virtual chats also work great if an in-person meet isn't possible.

At minimum, a quick chat during my visit (or virtually) would mean a lot, but I'm also open to a longer-term mentorship (ideally at least a year) if it feels like a good fit. In return, I will keep you in the loop for anything exciting that we build. (I have a team of 3)

1q33dw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pruritusani/comments/1q33dw9/broke_a_1_year_long_itch_heres_what_worked_for_me/,Broke a 1 year long itch - here's what worked for me,"I'm writing this out of pure passion. All the posts here are mirror images of my life for the past year: sleepless nights, being miserable during the day, constant mind distractions, wishing my life was normal again.

I'm not 100% good yet, but I've been able to reduce my itching by about 80% and I want to share what worked for me. Everyone's cause is personal, meaning every solution will be personal as well.

Here's what didn't work for me:

- Steroid creams (otc hydrocortisone, rx triamcinolone, and rx mometasone). I feel like it just thinned my skin even more, didn't provide any relief.

- Aquaphor, vaseline, various moisturizers. While seemingly great for prevention and dryness, no itch relief.

- Tea tree oil. All it did was burn my skin and did not provide itch relief. Witch hazel oil may fall in the same category.

- Prep H (no hydrocortisone). I used to think my issue was hemorroids, but it wasn't. The numbing ingredients in prep H did help but there are better stuff out there.

- Desitin. While I believe the 40% zinc oxide could help, it smells soooo bad and that is enough to steer me away. Also did not itch relief. 

- Cutting out caffeine. I tried 2 days without caffeine, honestly it just made my life more miserable. I've been drinking coffee since forever, but the itch only appeared a year ago. People here swear by cutting out caffeine, but I personally just can't do it.

- Wearing gloves to sleep/rubbing instead of itching. I used to think this worked until I woke with either missing gloves or blood on my gloves from forcefully itching in my sleep. Rubbing didn't help either because the friction from rubbing was enough to tear my skin and prevent healing.

- Wet wipes. Still too much friction and caused skin tearing.

Now here's what did work for me:

- Taking pics/vids down there to visually inspect the damage. After a night of scratching, it looked absolutely terrible. Blood, raw skin, discolored scarring. As I said, even just rubbing was enough to tear the skin. Seeing the damage with your own eyes makes you think twice before scratching.

- Breaking the itch-scratch cycle. Way easier said than done. I tracked the days without scratching like a drug addict going sober. Rubbing hard with soap or wet wipes counted as scratching because for me, it tears the skin. Tell yourself: itching = healing. This issue will never go away if you don't let it fully heal. 

- The sleepless nights were terrible. I had a full week of 3-4 hrs of sleep due to the constant witholding of scratching. But I'm telling you, its so worth it. Nap if you need to, take days off from work if possible. This is a real medical issue so don't feel the need to not give yourself the time needed to recover. I used to make it for 4 days without scratching at night, then I would relapse and destroy my skin all over again. Make it to 7 days, then 10, then 14. I promise if you truly aren't scratching or rubbing the area, it will become so much more bearable by day 7.

- Portable bidet. It's $30 on amazon. I bought two so I'll never go without it. As I said, wet wipes were enough to tear my skin and prevent healing. Portable bidet and dab with a paper towel (soft toilet paper will leave crumbs and cause further itching for me). I bring my bidet to work, public bathrooms, literally everywhere. It can even substitute as itching - cold water hitting your bum with decent pressure relieves the itching for me.

- Calmoseptine. $10 on amazon. The zinc oxide and calamine will help with healing, the menthol will provide an icy feeling to prevent itching. Warning - it sticks to fabric and is incredibly hard to wash out. I also bought a loose plastic diaper (meant for elderly incontinence) just so that the calmoseptine doesn't get on my clothes. I also wear a plastic glove before applying because it's very hard to wash off the skin. In the morning, rub a bunch of oil (coconut oil or jojoba oil) in the area to loosen the cream so it washes off easily. Don't try to scrub it off with soap and water, it will just smudge more and you risk tear skin by scrubbing hard.

- Wearing 3-4 layers of bottoms at night. I usually only sleep with underwear, and I was able to tear my skin with gloves when I sleep. Nowadays, I apply a generous amount of calmoseptine, loose plastic diaper, fabric underwear, gym shorts, and pajamas. This makes it nearly impossible to scratch, while also protecting my bedsheets from calmoseptine.

- For emergencies, vagisil (and I'm a guy). The numbing properties are good for emergencies but I wouldn't recommend long term use as some people say it causes further itching when used long term. Desitin combined with vagisil is what I did for 2-3 days before trying calmoseptine. Calmoseptine > desitin + vagisil for me.

I'm not 100% healed, but the skin around my bum is sooooo much more healed. I barely need to use calmoseptine, I just use aloe vera and other moisturizers. I still wear 3-4 layers to sleep, bidet all day everyday, still drinking coffee.

I would say I am pretty independent - when I want to do something, I just go out and do it without really thinking much of it. This has been a point of contention with my partner - he doesn't like it when I go off and do things without telling him. It isn't in a controlling manner, but he definitely feels like an overprotective helicopter at times. We've communicated and discussed this multiple times and we've improved but it keeps becoming an issue, especially this past week.

We went out for NYE with friends and at one of the bars, I got hungry so I went out with one of our friends to grab a hot dog and returned to the bar ten minutes later. The rest of the night he was passive-aggressive because he was upset I left the bar without telling him. We discussed it the next day and I told him that I didn't appreciate the attitude and that he should have told me he was upset by it rather than get passive aggressive. He was hurt by the fact that I left without telling him, which I understood. I thought that was it.

Nope. Yesterday I decided to work at the library and decided to grab a coffee from our favorite coffee shop on the way there. It just so happened that he was going there too to meet a friend and we had just passed each other. I thought it was a funny moment but he was upset because I didn't tell him and we could've grabbed coffee together. Now we're in a stalemate where we're both upset.

I really don't know what to do now. At first I thought it was a me issue because yes, sometimes I would just kinda dip and do my own thing without telling anyone because I didn't think much of it. I've improved by letting him know when I go out by sending quick texts, but it's like anytime I don't and forget to do so he makes it a whole thing. His reaction (he says it hurts that I don't think of him) is making me think we're just incompatible regarding this. I'm not sure, what advice do you all have? Is this something we can get through with communication or discussion? It just feels like I'm doing all the work by communicating more and anytime I mess up I'm the bad guy who hates her boyfriend.",1,1767467900.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

My boyfriend has had a chronic life altering tmj disorder since 2017.  It has affected him every day of his life since then. some days are better than others. Some days are truly terrible and it is really affecting his ability to work,  and enjoy life. 

These are the symptoms he currently experiences, every day. but some days are better than others . all of these symptoms are on both sides of the face.
-jaw pain
-ear fullness 
-constant feeling of discomfort and that something is out of place 
-crackling, grating sound in the ears 
-mild headaches 
-jaw severly deviates to one side 
-has not been able to wear a baseball cap since 2017 because its too much pain in the forehead, even if its not on tight or is a loose fitting hat 
-talking can be extremely challenging at times. and if he has to talk loud (like in a loud bar) that is the worst 
-it always seems to be worse when he is driving, especially through changing altitudes. and talking while driving can be extremely tough for him 
-affects his ability to think clearly/ bring fog/ light headed 
-light sensitivity
-the jaw feels best when its at rest and not speaking , and when stress is low . ice helps too
-definitely has forward head posture too, so working on correcting that currently 
-eating actually makes his jaw feel better 

Believe it or not he has already tried all this:
-this all started in 2017 as ear fullness (first symptom to appear) so he went to see his primary care doctor who thought he had fluid stuck in the middle ear so he referred him to an ENT , The ENT ran some tests said there was no fluid in the middle ear and he said that he should see an allergist or dentist (he has not seen an allergist but he has in the past and really only has seasonal allergies/dust/pollen ) 
-from there he spoke to his dentist like ENT suggested, who said he saw no signs of teeth grinding, so that was ruled out 
-from there new symptoms (listed above) started to appear gradually. 
-he then saw a tmj specialist who is actually an MD and dentist who specializes in these types of disorders. she took xrays, and ordered an mri. The mri came back showing that the disc was healthy. she said the jaw was out of alignment so she made him a custom appliance (like a mouthguard) that was supposed to move the jaw back into the appropriate position, but that did not work (he wore it for three years) 
-he has also seen two different physical therapists and tried a lot of postural, stretching, strengthening and pain management....nothing has done the trick
-he's also seen a physiatrist Dr who did injections into muscles in forehead, face, and neck, that did not work. then the physiatrist did injections directly into the joint....that seemed to work for a couple days but then all symptoms came back. The physiatrist also prescribed muscle relaxers which did not help. 
-he met with an oral surgeon several years ago and at the time they just prescribed high dose pain killers and an over the counter mouth guard. my boyfriend did not like the oral surgeon so he never went back for more treatment. 
-he did meet with another oral surgeon after that who he liked much better. The oral surgeon gave him a lot of time which he appreciated and they said technically surgery is possible but they said there are a lot of risks that come along with it. They wanted him to try a more conservative approach first (soft diet, cut back on caffeine). He has not done those things primarily because he does not think eating hard foods or drinking coffee is causing this particular problem. he has not been back to see that oral surgeon yet although he's thinking about it. 
-he also saw an orthodontist. The Ortho said the tmj issue could be possible because of teeth misalignment (his teeth were misaligned but not by much). He recommended invisalign braces and he decided to try it. That treatment took about a year and cost quite a bit. his teeth are now straight but it did not solve the problem at all. He wears a custom fit retainer at night now (top and bottom teeth) 
-he has seen two chiropractors for this issue. the first chiropractor did acupuncture and attempted jaw adjustments but none of that worked. 
He is currently seeing a new chiropractor who has more experience treating Tmj disorders but no progress yet. Chiro ordered a dynamic x-ray and the results showed that the jaw is definitely out of alignment , deviating clearly to one side. Chiro is saying the disc on one side must be out of place and is ordering a new MRI since last one is from 2019 
The new MRI is within the next 20 days. My boyfriend is also considering looking into arthocentesis for tmj because it looks minimally invasive and it does appear folks have gotten some relief from it. ",4,1767467849.0,TMJ,2,1.0,False

Howdy!

About me: 31, White, 6'2, dad bod, stagehand in NYC, I like coffee, beer, concerts, Broadway, video games, and quiet nights in. Kink friendly with a few hard limits.

What I'm looking for? Body type and hobbies don't matter too much to me, as long as we vibe and we're attracted to one another. While I'd prefer dating in or around NYC, I don't mind distance as long as we're within a 4-hour bus ride to one another. Also, please be at least 24.

I got a vasectomy and will gladly show recent test results should things progress to that point.

Quick checklist about things we should be on the same page about:

- Hardcore leftist, openly identifying as a Social Anarchist
- Monogamous 
- Fully vaxxed and DDF (but cool if you smoke the devil's lettuce)
- Horribly allergic to furry friends :(
- Trans Rights Are Human Rights

1q33bcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q33bcz/end_game_prosumer_request_5000/,End game prosumer request [5000],"In the market for a new setup, and am wanting to finally retire the Breville barista pro. Probably going to skip straight over HX machines.

Main considerations are:
- Dual boiler to cut down on morning routine time (it takes me 90 seconds to steam milk currently)
- ""Smart programming"" a big plus to schedule wake up times
- Joysticks a big plus just for ease of use
- Ease of ""routine maintenence"". I'm mechanicaly inclined, I can handle greasing cams and valves in an E61 no problem. 
- Potential for future water line. I'm probably going to run whatever machine I wind up with on the reservoir for the time being. The machine will go right above where my dishwasher is, and right next to a sink, so adding lines would be super easy. But, the cost of a BWT or equivalent would have to be defered for now. I would probably run a tray drain immediately however, seeing as it will be right next to the sink. If I could order a machine with one and not the other, I probably would. 
- Fast warm up time from off (or sleep if the machine is energy efficient) is a HUGE plus
- I'm team manual, but the other person who would be using the machine is team ""thats too much work, I'll just have coffee instead"". Would love to convert them over with a nicer to use machine. 

I plan on getting a few more nice tools like a spirograph, leveler and feedback tamp just to make it easy and consistent for when I'm not using it. With that said, and ability for volumetric is also a big considerstion. It would be super nice to set it up for a dose, and then they can just do the things and hit a button without worry of watching a scale and throwing the lever too late. 

Currently the machines in the running are Profitec Drive, ECM Synchronika II (both the ""traditional"" E61s), also a Bezzera Matrix DE, or potentially just waiting for the ECM Estetika. 

With that said, my local dealer (which mainly specializes in commercial to be fair) carries La Marzocco, Modbar, Rancilio, Nuova Simonelli, Victoria Arduino (WAY out of budget, but beautiful), Curtis, Fetco and Marco if that is of any consideration. 

To buy from the other brands, I would be driving considerable distance to drop my machine off somewhere if service is needed, or shipping my machine somewhere. (But with that said, I ship out things LTL daily, and wouldn't have a problem with that if needed)

So with all that said, what way would you guys go (or have gone) and why?

It sounds like a Fantasy novel.,"Looking for this novel. Add went to Fancy Novel app and the title was Jacqueline Frost. Can’t find anywhere else. I’d love to read it.

Here’s the description from Facebook. 


After Jacqueline was abandoned at birth, she grew up in foster care. She became the butt of jokes from parents and kids alike because of her blue skin. Until one day her fated mate Wilder found that she was missing princess of the Northern Kingdom.
""I found my mate."" His mother's pale brown eyes grew rounded as she absorbed his words.
""From what I've gleaned, she was given to humans as a baby. She was raised entirely by humans. I completely freaked her out. ""
""Impossible,"" his mother whispered.
""She was blue!"" he raised his voice at his mother, and she turned her brown eyes at him in understanding. ""My mate, my golden mate, is a true Frost.""
""What if,"" his mother started to speak softly, ""she is the missing child?""
""She has to be, Mom. She has to be. She's twenty-five. She's the right age. She doesn't know she's fae. She turned blue right in front of me.""
""Call her over. We need to sit her down and talk to her."" She hugged him tight exclaiming how amazing his news was.
————————
Jacqueline Frost was twenty-five years old. She'd been hearing the jokes about her name since she was dropped off at St. Bart's Hospital in a basket only a few hours old along with a note which said her name was Jacqueline Frost and that her mother couldn't keep her. It also hadn't helped she was blue. Her entire body was blue. At first the nurses at the hospital were convinced she was oxygen deprived. Then they thought maybe someone dunked her in blue dye. Nope. She was simply blue. Eventually it disappeared and by the time she was two she looked like a normal kid except for when she was angry because when she was angry, she turned blue. The doctor's hypothesized it was an oxygen deficiency because she was holding her breath while in a rage.
All it did was make it so kids wouldn't want to play with her and no family want to adopt her. Parents didn't want a kid with a health condition nobody could identify. Heaven only knew how expensive that would be.
Instead she grew up in foster care, the butt of jokes from parents and kids alike. There was one kid in one of her foster homes who thought since her blue tint came on when she was furious, it was apt to call her Stitch. 
However, with her name and the color, the name Jac Frost was the one she'd heard nearly every other day from the day she first understood the people spoke without concern for her feelings.
Now, standing in front of the counter wanting nothing more than to pick up her coffee and get to the office, the barista was grinning at her and laughing like she'd done the funniest thing ever by drawing all over her cup. 
""Yup. Can I have my cup?"" she waved to the woman who was pointing vigorously at all her designs. When the girl ignored her, she inhaled sharply and tried to calm herself. All the psychobabble in the world hadn't helped her keep her temper under control in a quarter century and yet here she was deep breathing like she'd run a marathon over a coffee cup.
""Lady!"" she snapped finally. ""I have to get to work. I appreciate the artistic abilities you possess to draw a cartoon of Jack Frost on my cup but I'm going to be late. Can I please have it?""
""Oh, sorry."" The girl blinked and passed her the cup and then was shocked when Jacqueline ripped the top off the cup and dumped her drink into the reusable thermos she carried with her and then left the decorated cup on the counter and walked out.
Jacqueline felt the heavy weight of stares of other customers and decided this would be the last time she was able to come this coffee shop. She looked down at her hand clutching her mug and noted the hue to her skin was not fading. She needed to get that under control before she got to the office. It was bad enough she was supposed to be doing her very first presentation for the CEO this morning, but going in cranky was going to be a problem.
Her boss, Wilder Vaughn, ran the biggest professional management company in all of North America. With clients signed from popstars to sports athletes, supermodels to actors, there was no shortage of work for her to perform as one of the consultants from the crisis management team.
This week one of the athletes they managed, a high-profile skier set for the Olympics, had been busted at a frat party in a hot tub undressed with three equally undressed girls. The problem, surprisingly, wasn't the menage-a-quatre this guy decided to have on college grounds. Nope. The problem was one of the girls was barely sixteen, brought to the party by one of her older college-aged sisters, and was the one sitting on the man's lap when he was caught.
The skier, Wraith Fairchild, swore that he didn't know she was so young. She'd come in with identification her sister had made for her. All IDs were checked at the door and nobody under nineteen was allowed into the party. The tabloids didn't seem to care though and for the last thirty-six hours he was being dragged through the mud for underage drinking and intercourse parties with minors.
Yesterday they were tasked with coming up with a plan to fix his image so he wouldn't get kicked off the Olympic team. Her boss had given it to her to come up with something to present to the CEO this morning because her boss, Percival, was dealing with another blowup involving an Oscar-winning actor who was filmed screwing his nanny on the kitchen counter while his baby was in the baby bouncy chair only a few feet away. She was convinced famous people traded their morals and ethics for publicity, but she didn't care. Their screw-ups were money in her bank account.
However, for the first time in her career, she was going to meet the CEO and she already bloody terrified.
She wasn't alone. There wasn't a woman in the building who didn't dream of him suddenly noticing them and then bedding them. He was every straight woman's fantasy. Tall. Broad shouldered. Tapered waist. Charismatic in the way a professional manager would need to be to schmooze his clients and make them feel secure and confident in his abilities. 
---
Wilder laughed lowly, ""You're chomping at the bit to have the opportunity to make this work. You want the win as much as I want the payday. Your first big account. Tell me you don't want the chance to sweet talk a client into agreeing to be our client."" When she hesitated, he held his hand out to shake. ""Come on Jacqueline. You know you want it.""
""Fine,"" she held her hand out and shook his.
Then the most curious thing to ever happen to her before caused her to blink in confusion. Her hand was engulfed in his and a golden rope of what she could only describe as energy encircled their hands and a current of electricity jolted up her arm straight to her chest. His eyes were fixed on hers and she was in awe.
She stared into his eyes and he stared back, a smile pulling the corner of his mouth. She looked around the room to see if anyone else was seeing what she was seeing, and everyone seemed frozen in time. Was she having a hallucination? Did the barista lace her coffee?
Jacqueline looked back to Wilder and yanked her hand out of his and sat on it. Turning to Percy she spoke loudly to break the weird moment, ""I'll go to gain the experience, but I want it noted that the rationale behind it is sexist and misogynistic.""
The room laughed, the moment faded, and she refused to look directly at the CEO for the duration of the meeting. The instant they started talking about the actor, she took her leave, declaring she needed to prepare for the meeting the following day, all the while the heated stare of Wilder following her out the door.
---
She was walking away.
Wilder's heart was slamming against his ribs as Jacqueline Frost, his mate, walked out of the room as if she hadn't just touched his hand and formed a mate bond with him.  He wanted to run after her and demand she explain why she was pretending with him, but he was in a room full of humans who wouldn't understand the concept of fae and mate bonds.
She'd been right under his nose all this time. For five years she'd been working for his company, several floors beneath him where he never dared go because for the most part, humans made his skin itch. Too many years of his life searching for his mate and she was right there. He struggled not to hyperventilate as she walked out of the room without a single backwards glance. His entire body was screaming to hold her and yet she was feigning ignorance.
He was aware of Percy getting ready to dive into the plan for the fuckwad who screwed his nanny, but Wilder was reeling.
""Give me a minute,"" he held a finger up and struggled not to run out the door to chase the woman he could see through the glass windows of the boardroom pushing the call button for the elevator. Marching quickly, he reached her as she stepped into the elevator and she looked up at him in surprise when he jumped in between the sliding doors and got into the box with her, closed the doors, and then stopped the elevator from moving.
""What are you doing?"" she looked at him wide-eyed.
""You felt it. I know you felt it. Why are you running?""
""I'm not running?"" she frowned up at him. ""I'm going back to my desk to work.""
He leaned forward and smelled her hair and considered it must be her shampoo.
""Did you just sniff me?"" she looked at him in horror.
""Yes. You're my mate.""
""I'm sorry. I'm what?""
""My mate. Surely you have been looking for me?""
""I am so confused,"" she muttered as she looked away from him and stared at the floor.
""What are you confused about? We are mates. I touched your hand and the threads of our bond joined and we are now mated, for life."" He reached for her, and she stepped backwards away from him and his heart clenched miserably. ""Why are you avoiding me?""
""Because you're loony?""
""I'm loony?""
""Yes. Did you suffer a fall or something this morning?""
""Oh,"" the word drawled slowly from his mouth as a thought occurred to him. ""You mentioned you grew up in foster care. Did you not know fairies get mates?""
""Fairies?""
""Yes. Fairies,"" he waved his hand between them.
He was unprepared for the way she threw her head back and laughed loudly. At first he was stunned by her radiant beauty, the silky, creamy column of her alabaster skin as she exposed her neck, the way her eyes crinkled at the corner and her plush lips parted as the sound as wondrous as a million bells rang around them. Then as she continued to laugh, gripping the wall for support the laugh became more mocking and he realized she was laughing at him.
""Why are you laughing?""
""Why are you screwing with me this morning?"" she retorted. ""I seriously thought the bimbo at the coffee shop laced my cup but now I'm thinking it's you who is messing with me. Is this a hazing thing? Before one of the staff gets their first big account, the CEO messes with them?""
He stared incredulously. ""I am not having a laugh.""
""You just called yourself a fairy,"" she giggled again. ""Do you sprinkle pixie dust and flitter around too?""
A horrible realizing crashed over him almost sending him to his knees as he stared at her in disbelief. She didn't know what she was. She didn't have a clue she was a fairy. How had she existed all this time without any of her powers manifesting or feeling the need to be around her own kind? Fairies by nature craved love and contact and nurtured family and connection.
""You've never been told you're a fairy?"" he asked cautiously.
""Yeah, boss man, I'm going to need you to unlock the elevator and let me get to work. This joke has gone on a hair too long and it's making me uncomfortable.""
""Okay, I need you to listen to me very carefully,"" he spoke softly and he reached for her hands and took them in his. The same exciting zing of connection flowed between them. When her eyes widened, he nodded, ""hear my words, my mate. You are a fairy. It is not a joke. I am in awe that you've never noticed this before in your lifetime or that someone of our kind has not come to you and explained anything. I don't know how you ended up believing you were human or living with humans instead of our kind, but you are a fairy, a child of fae. We typically live close to our own kind. We have abilities and skills humans do not. We also are blessed with one true mate, one love, which blooms and blossoms when we connect."" He lifted their hands together in between them, ""the brighter the thread, the stronger the bond. You saw the golden threads, didn't you?"" When her breath grew raspy he smiled, ""golden threads are the strongest of bonds. We were fated to be the example of what fae love is supposed to be. You must feel it.""
---
He could see in her blue eyes how confused she was and then she was yanking her hands away from him.
""This is not funny,"" her voice cracked. ""Do you think this kind of prank is funny? Let me guess, you practiced magic tricks as a kid and you're using them to screw with me on what I felt might be the best day of my career? I'm a joke to you?""
""No. Baby, no. I mean it."" He realized instantly calling her baby was a mistake as she lunged past him and smashed the button with her finger to make the elevator move. ""I'm sorry, Jacqueline. Please, let's talk about this.""
She then spun furiously and poked him in the chest.
""I don't know who you talked to or what you think this will accomplish but this is the height of violations of my privacy. Digging into my past to find out that I grew up lonely and longing for a family to throw this at me as a test or a hazing ritual is horrible and cruel.""
Her breath was coming in puffs as she spouted off at him. Many of her words were barely filtering as he caught sight of the crystals escaping her lips as she gave him inferno. Her cheeks were turning a slight shade of blue. Her hands were quickly darkening into a blue he could only describe as a sky blue but a weird compulsion to google shades of blue was filling his head because he knew it wasn't the right description.
""You're blue,"" he whispered aloud as the reality of her skin smacked him in the face. ""You're blue. You're blue.""
She froze at his words, her eyes rounded as she stared at her hands, her bag which held her laptop sliding down her shoulder to land on her wrist and she moved to catch it.
At that moment, the doors opened, and she fled out of the confines of the elevator and raced away. He felt his heart aching at the distance but then another thought filled his head as the doors closed again, caging him in the box and blocking her from sight. She was blue. There was only one kind of fae which turned blue.
Duplicating his earlier motion of stopping the elevator he used his cell phone to send a message to his parents and then leaned against the metal walls and waited for one of them to join him.
""An elevator?""
He hadn't waited long before his mother popped up in front of him.
""You have an office a handful of floors up.""
""Mom.""
""You texted me you needed me. Please do not tell me you think you're trapped in an elevator which cannot move?""

Then the most curious thing to ever happen to her before caused her to blink in confusion. Her hand was engulfed in his and a golden rope of what she could only describe as energy encircled their hands and a current of electricity jolted up her arm straight to her chest. His eyes were fixed on hers and she was in awe.
She stared into his eyes and he stared back, a smile pulling the corner of his mouth. She looked around the room to see if anyone else was seeing what she was seeing, and everyone seemed frozen in time. Was she having a hallucination? Did the barista lace her coffee?
Jacqueline looked back to Wilder and yanked her hand out of his and sat on it. Turning to Percy she spoke loudly to break the weird moment, ""I'll go to gain the experience, but I want it noted that the rationale behind it is sexist and misogynistic.""
The room laughed, the moment faded, and she refused to look directly at the CEO for the duration of the meeting. The instant they started talking about the actor, she took her leave, declaring she needed to prepare for the meeting the following day, all the while the heated stare of Wilder following her out the door.
---
She was walking away.
Wilder's heart was slamming against his ribs as Jacqueline Frost, his mate, walked out of the room as if she hadn't just touched his hand and formed a mate bond with him.  He wanted to run after her and demand she explain why she was pretending with him, but he was in a room full of humans who wouldn't understand the concept of fae and mate bonds.
She'd been right under his nose all this time. For five years she'd been working for his company, several floors beneath him where he never dared go because for the most part, humans made his skin itch. Too many years of his life searching for his mate and she was right there. He struggled not to hyperventilate as she walked out of the room without a single backwards glance. His entire body was screaming to hold her and yet she was feigning ignorance.
He was aware of Percy getting ready to dive into the plan for the fuckwad who screwed his nanny, but Wilder was reeling.
""Give me a minute,"" he held a finger up and struggled not to run out the door to chase the woman he could see through the glass windows of the boardroom pushing the call button for the elevator. Marching quickly, he reached her as she stepped into the elevator and she looked up at him in surprise when he jumped in between the sliding doors and got into the box with her, closed the doors, and then stopped the elevator from moving.
""What are you doing?"" she looked at him wide-eyed.
""You felt it. I know you felt it. Why are you running?""
""I'm not running?"" she frowned up at him. ""I'm going back to my desk to work.""
He leaned forward and smelled her hair and considered it must be her shampoo.
""Did you just sniff me?"" she looked at him in horror.
""Yes. You're my mate.""
""I'm sorry. I'm what?""
""My mate. Surely you have been looking for me?""
""I am so confused,"" she muttered as she looked away from him and stared at the floor.
""What are you confused about? We are mates. I touched your hand and the threads of our bond joined and we are now mated, for life."" He reached for her, and she stepped backwards away from him and his heart clenched miserably. ""Why are you avoiding me?""
""Because you're loony?""
""I'm loony?""
""Yes. Did you suffer a fall or something this morning?""
""Oh,"" the word drawled slowly from his mouth as a thought occurred to him. ""You mentioned you grew up in foster care. Did you not know fairies get mates?""
""Fairies?""
""Yes. Fairies,"" he waved his hand between them.
He was unprepared for the way she threw her head back and laughed loudly. At first he was stunned by her radiant beauty, the silky, creamy column of her alabaster skin as she exposed her neck, the way her eyes crinkled at the corner and her plush lips parted as the sound as wondrous as a million bells rang around them. Then as she continued to laugh, gripping the wall for support the laugh became more mocking and he realized she was laughing at him.
""Why are you laughing?""
""Why are you screwing with me this morning?"" she retorted. ""I seriously thought the bimbo at the coffee shop laced my cup but now I'm thinking it's you who is messing with me. Is this a hazing thing? Before one of the staff gets their first big account, the CEO messes with them?""
He stared incredulously. ""I am not having a laugh.""
""You just called yourself a fairy,"" she giggled again. ""Do you sprinkle pixie dust and flitter around too?""
A horrible realizing crashed over him almost sending him to his knees as he stared at her in disbelief. She didn't know what she was. She didn't have a clue she was a fairy. How had she existed all this time without any of her powers manifesting or feeling the need to be around her own kind? Fairies by nature craved love and contact and nurtured family and connection.
""You've never been told you're a fairy?"" he asked cautiously.
""Yeah, boss man, I'm going to need you to unlock the elevator and let me get to work. This joke has gone on a hair too long and it's making me uncomfortable.""
""Okay, I need you to listen to me very carefully,"" he spoke softly and he reached for her hands and took them in his. The same exciting zing of connection flowed between them. When her eyes widened, he nodded, ""hear my words, my mate. You are a fairy. It is not a joke. I am in awe that you've never noticed this before in your lifetime or that someone of our kind has not come to you and explained anything. I don't know how you ended up believing you were human or living with humans instead of our kind, but you are a fairy, a child of fae. We typically live close to our own kind. We have abilities and skills humans do not. We also are blessed with one true mate, one love, which blooms and blossoms when we connect."" He lifted their hands together in between them, ""the brighter the thread, the stronger the bond. You saw the golden threads, didn't you?"" When her breath grew raspy he smiled, ""golden threads are the strongest of bonds. We were fated to be the example of what fae love is supposed to be. You must feel it.""
---
He could see in her blue eyes how confused she was and then she was yanking her hands away from him.
""This is not funny,"" her voice cracked. ""Do you think this kind of prank is funny? Let me guess, you practiced magic tricks as a kid and you're using them to screw with me on what I felt might be the best day of my career? I'm a joke to you?""
""No. Baby, no. I mean it."" He realized instantly calling her baby was a mistake as she lunged past him and smashed the button with her finger to make the elevator move. ""I'm sorry, Jacqueline. Please, let's talk about this.""
She then spun furiously and poked him in the chest.
""I don't know who you talked to or what you think this will accomplish but this is the height of violations of my privacy. Digging into my past to find out that I grew up lonely and longing for a family to throw this at me as a test or a hazing ritual is horrible and cruel.""
Her breath was coming in puffs as she spouted off at him. Many of her words were barely filtering as he caught sight of the crystals escaping her lips as she gave him inferno. Her cheeks were turning a slight shade of blue. Her hands were quickly darkening into a blue he could only describe as a sky blue but a weird compulsion to google shades of blue was filling his head because he knew it wasn't the right description.
""You're blue,"" he whispered aloud as the reality of her skin smacked him in the face. ""You're blue. You're blue.""
She froze at his words, her eyes rounded as she stared at her hands, her bag which held her laptop sliding down her shoulder to land on her wrist and she moved to catch it.
At that moment, the doors opened, and she fled out of the confines of the elevator and raced away. He felt his heart aching at the distance but then another thought filled his head as the doors closed again, caging him in the box and blocking her from sight. She was blue. There was only one kind of fae which turned blue.
Duplicating his earlier motion of stopping the elevator he used his cell phone to send a message to his parents and then leaned against the metal walls and waited for one of them to join him.
""An elevator?""
He hadn't waited long before his mother popped up in front of him.
""You have an office a handful of floors up.""
""Mom.""
""You texted me you needed me. Please do not tell me you think you're trapped in an elevator which cannot move?""
""I found my mate.""",1,1767467524.0,novelsfree,2,1.0,False

No screens. No slogans. No metrics. Just nature, restored and curated, the brochure said. A place where burnt-out professionals could *decompress*.

The first thing Martin noticed was the trees.

They were wrong — not sick, not dead, but **branded**. Each leaf bore a faint, vascular pattern that resolved, once his eyes adjusted, into a familiar script. Curved white lettering traced through green tissue like veins.

He laughed once. Stress hallucination. Burnout does that.

Then the wind shifted, and a hundred leaves turned at once, catching the sun. **Coca-Cola**, repeated endlessly, as if the forest itself were thirsting.

The guide said nothing.

At breakfast, the butter came wrapped in bark. The ants formed neat, marching arrows toward the jam. Martin tried not to look too closely at the bird perched on the railing, its feathers subtly rearranged into a swoosh.

He told himself this was art. Satire. A corporate joke taken too far.

The tortoise broke him.

It moved slowly across the path, ancient and patient. On its shell, fused into keratin and bone, was the unmistakable green circle of a **Starbucks Coffee** logo. Weathered. Cracked. Old enough to suggest it had *grown that way*.

Martin knelt. His hands shook.

“Who did this?” he whispered.

The guide smiled gently. “No one. We just… encouraged adaptation.”

That night, the forest whispered in slogans.

*Open happiness.*

*Think different.*

*Because you’re worth it.*

They came from the soil, the roots, the insects. Branding embedded at the cellular level, passed down, inherited. A world that had learned the only language it was ever taught.

Martin screamed until his voice gave out.

In the mirror, he saw it starting — faint lines along his skin, letters just beneath the surface, waiting. He scratched until he bled, but the words were deeper than flesh.

By morning, he understood.

He had spent years teaching systems how to colonize attention, how to rewrite desire, how to make identity repeatable. The environment had simply finished the job — **total market saturation**.

When they found him days later, he was calm.

Smiling.

On his forehead, perfectly centered, a slogan had emerged in neat, bloodless script:

First, I did quite a few experiments and that gave me many insights which helped. Even if you don't like any of the insights below, try experimenting and nailing down when you become addicted and how.

If this resonates, read on...

**When do I become a slave to my devices?**

\- Mornings, if I start using my phone or laptop before fully waking up

\- Nights, if the last thing I did was watch a screen before going to sleep

(on days I didn't do this, I automatically make better choices)

**How do I become a slave**

\- When I don't first use other emotion regulation tools and default to using phone as that tool

(on days I am a slave, there is very little I can do to fix it, so my strategy is prevention)

**Day when I win**

\- When I occupy myself in the morning and then pick up the phone. I do that by making coffee and quick but cooked breakfast & have that before going to phone

\- Between the time I am awake and fully woken up, I do positive affirmations in the mind, basically, how my day will be amazing and how I am amazing too. That can't be done if phone takes up space

\- I do bed time yoga or read a book or talk or even do quick journaling before going to bed (there are some specifics on yoga and journaling if you are interested)

**How does it look for long term..**

\- I never joined Instagram and left FB many years ago

\- 6 months with grayscale and plan to keep it

\- I keep reminding myself how terrible devices are as tools for emotional regulation

\- When I do use devices as tools for emotional regulation, I tolerate a few minutes of discomfort before doing that to make it intentional

\- Daily meditation, weekly therapy and almost daily yoga to keep myself sane (most people may not need this much)

\- Bring fun things in life, these days it's volleyball, k-drama, reading and talking to my partner

1q336cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q336cy/the_oldest_son/,The Oldest Son,"Chapter One.

The oldest son never truly leaves town.

That’s the version we give outsiders; we say it like a tired joke, like something half true and half harmless. He ran off; got bored; found trouble somewhere else. The words come easy because they have been practiced, handed down the way you pass down fence posts or recipes that stretch meat farther than it should.

The truth is always harder to say.

The truth is that the oldest son belongs to the land.

The first sign something was wrong was my father measuring me.

It was early spring, the kind that smells like thawed mud and rusted water, when winter has not quite let go of its grip. He stood me in the kitchen doorway with a length of twine, pressing it flat across my shoulders, then down my chest, then around my back. He didn’t explain what it was for. He did not look at my face.

“Stand straight,” he said, pressing his palm to the middle of my back. 

I did.

The twine scratched my neck. His hands were rough and careful at the same time, like he was afraid of hurting me but more afraid of doing it wrong. When he finished, he cut the twine and folded it neatly, slipping it into his pocket like something valuable.

My mother watched from the stove. She stirred a pot that did not need stirring, eyes fixed on the steam rising up as if it could hide her from the room.

“What’s it for?” I asked.

My father hesitated, just a moment too long.

“Later,” he said.

“Later, when?” I pestered, curious and afraid. His jaw clenched, setting down the spool of twine. 

“That’s not something for you to worry about, yet,” He told me, his voice tense. 

“Dad, I’m just curious, I-“

“I said don’t worry about it!” He yelled. 

My father was never a loud man, soft-spoken but stern. My questions scared him, I knew it.

I learned not to ask why after that. 

I was just sixteen then. Still months away from seventeen, still technically safe, if safety was ever real to begin with.

After that morning, small things began to change.

My father started paying closer attention to me. Not in the way parents usually do, not with concern or pride, but with inventory. He noticed how tall I was getting, how my shoulders filled out my jacket, how much space I took up at the table. He watched me eat, watched me sleep, watched me walk across the yard like he was trying to memorize me. He…studied me. 

At night, I lay awake listening to the house settle around us. The walls popped softly, the floorboards creaked, the old place breathing like a tired animal. Sometimes I imagined it was listening too.

Chapter Two.

My name disappeared in May.

I found out by accident, flipping through the family Bible while the house was quiet. My father kept meticulous records inside the front cover. Births, deaths, marriages, written in ink that had browned with age. My grandparents. My parents.  Then finally, me.

Or rather, not me.

The space where my name should have been was blank.

There was not mark of erasure, just an absence of a name that should’ve been. 

I checked the handwriting. It was my father’s. It always had been.

That night, I asked my mother about it.

She stood at the sink, hands submerged in water long after the dishes were clean. When she answered, she didn’t turn around.

“You must be remembering wrong, Silas,” she said.

“I’m not.”

Her shoulders tightened.

“Please,” she said quietly. “Don’t start this.”

After that, I noticed how often my name went unused.

Teachers called on me less. Neighbors greeted my parents and nodded at me like I was an afterthought. At church, the pastor spoke often about duty and obedience, about knowing your place in the order of things. His eyes slid over me without settling.

The town felt like it was gently backing away. Fading out of view like someone was forgetting what it looked like. 

Even the animals noticed. Dogs avoided me. Livestock shifted nervously when I passed. Once, a horse reared for no reason at all, eyes rolling white, and had to be calmed by three grown men. I felt like an omen, a curse. Something dark hang over the town, and it centered  on me. 

My father began locking the doors at night.

All of them. 

I heard the keys after midnight, the careful click of locks being tested and retested. He paced the halls, trying every door over and over again until he finally felt satisfied enough. 

Once, I woke to find him standing in my doorway, watching me breathe. Examining my unconscious form like a predator to its prey. 

“Just checking,” he said.

I didn’t sleep after that.

Chapter Three.

By summer, the woods felt closer.

They had not moved, not in any way I could measure, but the air around them felt heavier, as if something unseen was pressing outward, testing the boundary between trees and field. The treeline seemed darker than it had before, the shadows pooling thicker beneath the branches. Even in full daylight, the forest swallowed light in a way that felt intentional.

I avoided looking at it whenever I could.

Still, my eyes were drawn there against my will. I would catch myself staring while crossing the yard, or standing at the sink, or walking home from town. The woods did not respond. They did not shift or whisper or beckon. They simply existed, patient and unmoved, which somehow felt worse.

People in town began asking my father how I was doing.

They asked him in the feed store, at church, in passing on the sidewalk. Their voices were casual, but their eyes lingered on his face a moment too long, searching for something in his expression.

They did not ask me.

When I entered a room, conversations softened or stalled entirely. I became something people talked around instead of to. At school, teachers no longer scolded me when I drifted off during lessons. They let my silence pass without comment, as if correcting me would be pointless.

At the feed store, an old man leaned across the counter and studied me with open curiosity.

“You look grown,” he said.

It did not sound like praise. It sounded like a conclusion. I nodded uncomfortably, looking away before leaving the store. 

At home, my father spent more and more time in the barn.

I heard him out there late into the night, long after the rest of the house had gone still. Tools scraped and clattered. Wood dragged across the floor in slow, heavy movements. Sometimes there was a dull thud, followed by silence, and then the sound of something being shifted again, as if he could not get it positioned the way he wanted.

When I asked what he was working on, he told me not to worry about it.

His hands were rougher than usual. His eyes stayed fixed somewhere just past me.

My mother stopped speaking to me unless absolutely necessary.

She answered questions with nods or single words. She avoided being alone with me. When I entered a room, she found a reason to leave it. Once, I caught her watching me from the hallway, her expression tight and unreadable, like she was memorizing my face against her will.

One night, after supper, I asked her if she was afraid of me.

The question hung between us, heavy and undeniable.

She closed her eyes and rested her hands flat on the table, fingers spread wide as if bracing herself.

“I am afraid for you,” she said, “I’m afraid…to lose you.” 

Her voice was quiet. Steady.

That was worse.

After that, I slept poorly.

I woke often, heart racing, certain someone had been standing over my bed. Sometimes I heard footsteps outside my door. Sometimes I thought I heard breathing that was not my own. Each time, I told myself it was nothing, that fear had a way of inventing sounds when given too much room.

The night before my birthday, the dream came.

I was standing in the woods, barefoot, the ground cold and damp beneath my feet. Leaves clung to my skin. The air was thick and difficult to breathe. I could not see anything ahead of me, not trees, not sky, not even my own hands, but I could feel something waiting.

It simply waited, certain I would move eventually.

I woke drenched in sweat, my sheets twisted tight around my legs, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. For a long time, I lay there staring into the dark, listening to the house settle and breathe around me.

Outside my window, the woods were quiet.

They always were.

Chapter Four.

The morning of my seventeenth birthday came like any other, except that nothing felt ordinary. The sun rose pale and thin over the fields, struggling to burn off a mist that hung stubbornly low. The air smelled damp, not of rain but of something deeper, older, something the earth had been hiding all year. I noticed it first when I walked past the fence line on my way to the barn. The grass pressed against my legs, wet and sticky, and the treeline looked closer than it had the night before. Shadows pooled unnaturally under the trees, darkening the edge of the woods like ink spreading in water.

My father sat at the table, coffee cooling in his mug. He did not glance at me when I entered. He only stared toward the fields, his hands wrapped tightly around the mug as if it were something alive. My mother moved silently behind him, setting plates for breakfast without a word. I tried to speak first, to say something that might break the silence, but the words stuck in my throat. Every instinct told me not to move too fast, not to look too closely, and certainly not to challenge the quiet the house had fallen into.

“You know what today is,” my father said, his voice low, deliberate, measured. It carried weight, not just the ordinary weight of a parent’s words, but the kind that presses on the chest, the kind that makes a person swallow hard without thinking about it.

“Yes,” I said.

He did not respond immediately. His eyes never met mine. Instead, he leaned back in his chair, fingers tapping on the mug. I tried to read his expression. There was fear there, but it was buried beneath something colder, something deliberate, like a blade hidden inside cloth.

“You going anywhere?” he asked after a long pause.

“No,” I replied.

He considered me, silent again, the sound of the clock ticking in the background louder than it should have been.

“You should,” he said finally.

“Well, I’m not,” I said, firm this time, forcing the words past the dry weight in my throat.

I saw it then, the small flare of anger in his eyes, quickly covered by the mask he always wore: calm, steady, unshakable.

“You do not get to decide that,” he said. The words were sharper this time, carrying a finality I could feel in my chest.

“I already have,” I answered, even though my body trembled beneath the table.

Breakfast passed without other words. My mother avoided my eyes entirely, her hands busy clearing plates, wiping counters, arranging silverware. I knew she wanted to say something, to stop what was coming, but she couldn’t. She was trapped in her own miserable silence.

The morning stretched far too long. I stayed visible, walking slowly in the yard, passing the fence line repeatedly. The fields, normally comforting, felt constrictive. The trees whispered when the wind blew, leaves brushing against one another as if conspiring. I could feel them watching. Not seeing, not like eyes, but feeling. The pressure of expectation built in the air around me until it became a thing I could almost touch.

By mid-afternoon, the first horror arrived. It was small at first: a shape at the edge of the woods, the flicker of movement that could have been a deer, or a branch, or something watching me that did not belong. I froze. My heart jumped, pounding so hard I thought it might crack my chest. The shape shifted, deeper into the shadows, and I could swear it moved with purpose, tracking me, anticipating me. I ran toward the barn, desperate for the familiar, but the yard seemed longer than usual, the fence posts leaning inward as if pushing me along, herding me.

Inside the barn, it was darker than I remembered. Dust motes swirled in shafts of sunlight, but the corners hid deeper blackness that seemed to pulse, to breathe. My father was there, not working, just standing among the tools and boards, silent. When I saw him, my stomach sank. He was not angry yet. That would come later. This was worse: the quiet patience of someone who has already decided what must happen and is only waiting for the correct moment to act. 

“You were supposed to go,” he said softly.

“I didn’t, ” I answered, voice shaking.

He stepped closer, the boards beneath his boots creaking in protest. Each step echoed in the barn, magnified by the emptiness. I realized suddenly how alone I was, how unprepared. The forest outside might have been patient, but my father was deliberate, and deliberate always hurt more than patient.

“Do you know what it means to refuse?” he asked.

“No-no, I don’t,” I said, though the answer came out wrong even to me. I knew I was lying.

He reached for a tool leaning against the wall. Nothing heavy, nothing sharp. Not yet. Just a hammer, but the intent behind it made the air seem heavier, as though the room itself was pressing down on me.

I backed toward the doorway. My feet caught on loose straw. I fell. Pain shot through my knee, sharp and raw. The hammer lifted above him, steady, patient, a warning I could not ignore.

Outside, the woods stirred nervously. A wind rose that had no discernible source. Leaves tumbled across the yard like tiny dry hands reaching out for me. Shadows moved just past the edge of vision. I could feel them pressing inward, urging me forward, pushing me toward survival I did not want yet could not refuse.

I scrambled to my feet. My father did not pursue, not yet, but his eyes stayed fixed on me, unblinking, unwavering. And behind him, I heard something that made my chest tighten with dread: a faint, low whisper, or perhaps the sound of the trees themselves, pressing toward me, counting, waiting.

I raised my hands, as if that would help. 

“Dad-dad, I-“ I bolted.

I ran, and kept running away from my father as he stayed behind. 

And for the first time, the woods did not wait.

Chapter Five.

The night was alive in a way I had never noticed before. Every leaf, every shadow, every sound of the forest seemed deliberate, as if the woods themselves were awake and watching. My father came home later than usual, moving through the yard with a sound that made my blood run cold. Boots against wet grass, soft at first, then louder, deliberate. I knew without seeing him that he carried something. His patience had snapped into action.

I tried to stay in the house, but instinct made me move toward the barn. The door was cracked open, the dim light of the moon spilling in. I should have stayed. I knew it.

“You should have gone,” my father said, stepping into the doorway. His voice was low, calm, but the air around it vibrated with danger.

“I-I’m not going,” I said, though the words trembled.

He took a step forward, and I ran.

The yard stretched out before me in the silver light of the moon. My bare feet struck the wet grass, mud and dew soaking through. I heard him behind me, shouts, heavy steps, the sound of the world shrinking to the sound of his boots hitting the ground and my lungs burning.

He caught up too fast. His hands grabbed my shoulders, yanking me backward. Pain exploded in my chest as he twisted me against his weight. My knee buckled on the uneven ground. I stumbled, scraping my palms along the wet earth.

“Do not make this harder!” he shouted.

I twisted, trying to break free. He swung me around, slamming me against a tree. The bark cut my cheek and tore my shirt. Pain radiated through my ribs, breath stolen by the impact.

The woods loomed just beyond the fence line. I wanted to get there. I had to. But my father’s grip was iron, his determination absolute.

He grabbed me under the arms, lifting me off the ground. The muscles in my shoulders screamed. He yanked me toward the treeline, and I clawed at the grass, at the bark, at anything that might give me leverage. My hands were slick with blood and dirt, losing any chance of a grip of safety. 

“You do not get to refuse!” he yelled, a sound raw and animal, tearing through the night.

“The Oldest Son belongs to the woods! You don’t understand, Silas!” He yelled. 

I kicked, I thrashed, but his strength was overwhelming. He swung me closer to the first dark trees. The shadows waited, patient, and I felt their pull, as if they wanted me too. My panic sharpened every sense. I could hear the snap of branches under my weight, smell the forest floor in the dark, taste iron in my mouth from a cut on my lip.

Then the hammer hit me over the head.

The world exploded into pain, vision going red and black. My legs folded beneath me. The ground rolled beneath my vision. I crumpled, out cold, and the forest spun around me in shapes I could not name.

When I came to, my arms and legs felt heavy and weak. My father’s hands were under my armpits, dragging me upright. His face loomed above me, pale in the moonlight, eyes wide and wild. He grunted as he tried to force me into the woods.

“No,” I rasped. My voice was raw, trembling.

He ignored me, muscles straining, dragging me closer to the dark mass of trees. My own panic lent strength to desperation. I kicked backward, connecting with his knee, jerking him off balance. I twisted, grabbing at his arms, clawing at his wrists.

He swung again, connecting with my stomach. I stumbled, caught a branch, pulled myself upright. He grunted, fury blazing in his eyes, but I had found leverage, and the forest seemed to tilt in my favor.

I struck him in the side of the head with my elbow. He staggered, off balance just long enough. I twisted, dropped to the ground, and ran, sprinting for the fence line. My lungs burned, my vision blurred, blood and sweat stinging my eyes. Branches whipped against my face, scraping my arms and legs, but I did not care. I couldn’t stop.

He roared behind me. The sound of him tearing through the grass, snapping the underbrush, was so loud it made my chest vibrate. He lunged again, hands outstretched, and I dove forward under the low branches, rolling through the mud. Pain screamed through my ankle, sharp and sudden, but I pushed through it.

The treeline drew close. The shadows pooled at the edge, waiting. My father grabbed at me one last time, just as I passed the first trees. I twisted, kicked backward, and felt his hands slip. I did not stop running. I ran until the fence was behind me, until the ground flattened, until the first stars blinked through the leaves above.

Finally, I collapsed in the dirt, gasping, chest heaving, limbs trembling. My head throbbed in time with my heart. Every nerve in my body screamed. The woods were quiet now, patient again, as if judging me, waiting for what would come next.

I was alive.

But I knew he would not stop.

And I knew the woods had not yet finished watching.

Chapter Six.

The night was darker than I had ever known. The moon had disappeared behind thick clouds, leaving the world in shades of black and gray. Every sound seemed sharper. My body throbbed from the previous night, every step a reminder of how close I had come to death. Every nerve in my body screamed, but there was no rest to be found. I knew he would come. I knew my father would not stop.

I moved cautiously through the fields, sticking to low ground where the grass would hide my footsteps. My hands were slick with old mud and new blood, cuts from the trees stinging. My chest heaved, lungs burning. Every shadow made me jump. Every breeze through the tall grass sounded like his boots.

I heard him before I saw him. His voice carried over the cold air, sharp and furious.

“You cannot run from me! SILAS!”

I broke into a sprint.

Pain shot through my body, but I did not stop. My body was a collection of bruises and scratches from the last chase. My shirt was ripped across the back, my arms raw from branches. But desperation lent strength I did not know I had. I ran toward the treeline, the dark waiting, calling, pulling me.

He came after me, relentless. His hands found me again, this time striking across my back and side. Pain exploded in sharp bursts. My ribs cracked under the force. I fell, rolling in the mud, my head smacking against the earth. Stars swirled above me, and I tasted iron in my mouth. He loomed over me, eyes wild, fists ready, dragging me upright, not letting me catch my breath.

“Do not make me finish this!” he screamed.

I twisted, kicked backward, clawed at his wrists, but his strength was absolute. I could feel my muscles tear as he swung me around, dragging me toward the dark edge of the woods. I bit, I screamed, I clawed at the grass, but he ignored everything except the determination that had always been in his eyes.

A sudden shiver ran through the trees, almost like the forest itself was inhaling. My father stumbled as if pulled from within, his feet caught in unseen roots. The branches seemed to reach for him, grabbing at his coat, snagging his sleeves. He roared, anger turning to panic, and I realized too late that the woods had moved.

With a sudden, violent tug, the roots and branches yanked him into the forest. He screamed, a sound raw and human, but cut off by the roar of the trees. The ground seemed alive, the branches wrapping around him, twisting, snapping. I could hear the tearing of cloth and flesh, the sound of something breaking that should not break. His hands clawed at the trunks, at the soil, at nothing. The shadows consumed him, dragging him deeper, and then the sounds stopped abruptly, leaving only the night and the low sigh of the wind moving through the leaves.

I collapsed to my knees in the field, chest heaving, blood running down my side from cuts my father had inflicted, ribs throbbing, ankle twisted. My body screamed in agony. I tasted dust and iron, my hands shaking uncontrollably.

I looked toward the woods. The shadows seemed still again, patient, as if nothing had happened. But I knew better. The forest had judged, and it had acted. My father had been pulled into it, torn apart by something older and stronger than either of us. I could feel it in the air, in the smell of wet earth, in the oppressive darkness.

I was alive.

I should have been terrified, but the only terror I could feel now was the memory of his hands, the sound of his voice, the way he had tried to end me. The woods had saved me, but they had done so in a way that left no room for gratitude. Only fear.

I lay in the mud for a long time, listening. The forest was quiet, but it was watching. Always watching. The branches rustled quietly as if having a conversation in a dead language. The trees swayed with an undeniable grace that man had no idea how to comprehend. The shadows had eyes I could not see, patience I could not measure, and the sense that one day I would owe it something, or it would take something else, lingered heavy in my chest.

I moved after dawn. Every step was agony, but I forced myself to rise, forced myself toward the old barn, the nearest house, anywhere I could survive another day. Behind me, the woods loomed, still, patient, and I knew that what had happened tonight was not mercy. It was the beginning of something far larger.

I was alive, but I was changed.

On the 28th she and my other SIL, who we'll to as R, with whom she was staying, were really scrambling to keep her son(10) entertained.

My husband and I invited them to join us at an Arabic owned coffee house that we frequent. Not great fun for the kid, but my husband was going to show him some drawing techniques.

My nephew was not invested, very energetic, and frankly not behaving well. I was mostly ignoring it, not my kid not my problem, until he held up one of his drawings for all of us to see. He had drawn a N@zi swastika. And he was smiling and giggling, presenting it with alarming pride.

I started interrogating him; ""Do you know what that is?"" , ""Do you know what that means?"" , ""Do you know who used that symbol?"". I was pretty angry, but I could tell it was some gross bid for attention since his answers were all smiley yeses.

B meanwhile did nothing. She did not ask him questions, she did not scold him. Nothing. So my husband and I left, not in a huff or anything, just said it was late and we had to go.

The next day we heard from R that she sent B and son packing. She brought the incident back up when they got home and B's indifference continued. R told them to kick rocks and they went home.

So here we are a week later and this is the point at which I must ask if I am overreacting. I expected an apology at least from B for her son's behavior if not an apology from him. Yet we had heard nothing. We contacted B, saying we were concerned about his behavior and specifically concerned that no apology had been forthcoming. She brushed us off, saying she talked to her son about it and we shouldn't worry because ""no one else saw it"" - the end, no apology offered. I was and am livid.

Above you can see my small one-room apartment. I recently bought an armchair (with a footrest) to complete my home (see last picture- I haven’t picked it up yet). I’d love to create a cozy living-room corner that also limits my ability to watch TV from my bed, because that habit keeps me awake until late at night.

In general, I really like clearly defined “topic corners,” such as a dining-table/kitchen area, a sleeping area, and so on.

I’m planning to get another small drawer unit with wheels to place under my dining table, where I can store all the dishes that are currently on the shelves above the washer-dryer. That might also give me the chance to move the microwave and other kitchen appliances (coffee machine, kettle, etc.) into the shelves in the kitchen area—if I can manage to get an extension cable there.

I’d also like to hide my shoe rack a bit better and, overall, move slightly away from a very basic look without making the space feel overloaded. If you have any nice ideas on how to “pimp” the rather boring white IKEA furniture, I’d be super grateful 😵‍💫

I’m happy about any suggestions or creative ideas—thank you so much in advance for taking the time to help! ✨

They have always been like this since the birth of their country. Always unapologetic, ruthless and precise. Yes, sometimes they end up in really bad situations but if you notice it's often by their own miscalculations rather than someone else being able to outpower them.

At the time we had a Vertuo machine so we kept the Gran Lattissima in the box until it was needed to replace the Vertuo. I’ve had the Vertuo since 2018 and it still works amazing so I’m a big nespresso fan. We just opened the Gran Lattissima and it SUCKS. The drinks are incredibly watery. I’ve tried everything- different milks, different capsules. Cleaning the machine. I admittedly have not yet descaled it. A plain espresso tastes fine and just making hot milk tastes fine. The drinks taste like swamp water.

I called nespresso today and the customer service agent provided the worst customer service I’ve ever had in my life (as a millennial that pains me to even say, but it was that bad). After watching me run ONE drink he says- the machine is running fine there’s nothing that can be done. He argued with me that no water goes through the milk frother which I believe is fundamentally wrong but okay. After arguing he finally offered to walk me through a factory reset. Insane to me that this wasn’t offered earlier. That unfortunately didn’t work. I then begged for the option for a potential repair. Initially he told me it was impossible since I’m outside the warranty. I then begged to pay for a repair. He finally said he would look into it and came back to tell me that this machine cannot be repaired at this time which doesn’t really make sense to me. This was an hour long call so I got so fed up I hung up on him.

I’m not sure what my question here even is other than- should I just throw the machine out? Or accept that I can only make hot milk and espresso separately?

Most of us suck at spotting when someone’s into us… even if it’s painfully obvious to everyone else. What’s wild is how often secret crushes happen in silence at school, work, or your friend group, and we miss them. A big reason? We've been fed nonsense from TikTok dating “experts” who base everything on eye contact, astrology, or “vibes.” No shade, but vibes don’t equal data.

This post breaks down 

8 lowkey signs someone’s crushing on you, pulled from behavioural psychology studies, neuroscience, and expert relationship advice that actually checks out. If you’ve been confused or overthinking someone’s behaviour around you, this might clear things up.

These aren’t just random guesses. They're backed by research from people like Dr Monica Moore (a psychologist who studied flirting signals), the Gottman Institute, and studies from the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour.

Here’s what to look for:

They mirror your body language or speech patterns
This is one of the most consistent unconscious signals of attraction. According to a study published in “Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour”, people tend to mimic the gestures, posture, or even verbal tone of someone they find attractive. It’s not mean-girl copying. It’s a real social bonding mechanism called the “chameleon effect.”

They remember small things you barely recall saying 
Crushes activate dopamine-heavy circuits in the brain — creating intense focus, says Dr Helen Fisher, biological anthropologist. So if they’re recalling your favourite obscure band, weird coffee order, or the fact your dog hates the colour red… they’re storing info like a lovesick AI.

They appear more clumsy or “off” around you 
This isn’t a romcom trope. According to a study from Radboud University, individuals under romantic stress often exhibit increased fidgeting, awkward pauses, or nervous laughter. Their brain is running multiple thought loops while trying to “act normal.” It doesn’t always work.

They suddenly adjust their appearance before seeing you
Dr Monica Moore found that one of the earliest signs of interest is “preening”, fixing clothes, touching hair, checking appearance often before or during interaction. No one grooms that hard for someone they feel neutral toward.

Hey always find soft excuses to talk to you
Even if it’s “fake asking for help” or randomly sending memes at midnight, this pattern is real. Research at the University of Kansas found that initiating low-stakes conversation is often a way to test emotional availability without risking rejection.

Their friends act weird when you’re around
Crushes rarely stay secret *among friends*. If you walk into a room and your friends suddenly giggle, glance at you, or leave the two of you alone, that’s social evidence. A study from Purdue found that peer-group behaviour often reveals hidden romantic interests indirectly.

They get protective or unusually quiet when you mention someone else
Psychologist Albert Mehrabian’s work on emotional communication shows that even nonverbal cues such as body tension, silences, or subtle eye movements can reflect discomfort or jealousy when a crush senses competition.

They linger longer than they need to
Time is a major signal. If they keep hanging around after the group work is done, extend convos past the natural end, or always wait for you when leaving… that’s investment. In attraction psychology, proximity and time spent are key predictors of underlying interest (see: Dr Elaine Hatfield’s work on passionate love).

Of course, not every sign is a guarantee that they’re in love. They could also be shy, socially anxious, or just really kind. But when you start seeing several of these signs at once? Yeah, someone might just be falling for you from behind the scenes.

My daughter is 7 years old. She was (finally) diagnosed in November with autism and a moderate intellectual disability.she is non verbal and will only communicate in one word sentences.

The problem we’re having is her impulse control, in the last 24 hours she has; swallowed a necklace that required us to to take her to A&E ( which was a horrific experience in itself as she has bad medical anxiety) tore apart her nappy, started eating it and peed on her floor, she knows this isn’t on.

She understands right from wrong, if she is doing something naughty and we tell her to stop, she won’t stop until I say something along the lines of “stop doing X or i will be switching the tv off” etc. she will then try to sneak off and engage in said behaviour somewhere else in the house. I know she’s sneaking off because she walks like a cartoon character sneaking when she does it and watches me the full time when she’s trying to walk away😂 her teachers have confirmed this as well, as they reckon her verbal comprehension is better than her actual vocalisation. Even the teacher say that they don’t know how we do it as she is so much.they have had to move furniture in the classroom so she will not try to climb out windows and the likes.

My house is a war zone 24/7 I literally can’t run downstairs to make a cup of coffee or do some dishes for 2 minutes. I done the latter a couple of weeks ago and she proceeded to stuff a full toilet roll down our toilet and flooded our kitchen. She knows what she’s doing is naughty but it’s almost as if she can’t help herself and has to complete that task.once she gets something in her head there’s no stopping her, it can be something as simple as taking a wrong turn on a journey. She’s not sleeping through the night, she wakes up after 4 hours of sleep and will just shout “help” at the top of her voice until someone comes in and stays up with her. 

Recently she has been getting more violent, she’s been bitting scratching flinging stuff and getting all round more violent to everyone she knows, I’m exhausted.any minor inconvenience is a screaming match and I’m feeling terrible for my neighbours. I’m scared we’re going to get an asbo because of the noise she is making.

I’m truly at my wits end. Me and my fiancée are on the rocks I feel like my full world is falling apart. We get no respite. Nobody can handle her anymore. Every night before I go to sleep I fantasise about not waking up the next day and it makes me feel horrible because I want to be there 100% as a father for my two children but I’m genuinely so exhausted with my situation.

In some cases, I’ll agree, since the lyrics aren’t especially deep and the music itself is nothing we haven’t seen before.

However.

I don’t think it’s fair to call the music “bad” simply because it’s not your cuppa coffee. Saying “I don’t like their music” is fine, in fact, that’s what the sub is for: discussing our opinions gently! Saying “the music sucks” is less helpful, and not really what we do here. 

Some people (like myself, to be completely transparent) enjoy that sort of “empty pop” from time to time. I’m all for songs that are profound and moving, but I also occasionally enjoy the weirdness that is Internet Girl and Gnarly.

Most people take issue with the girls’ talent being wasted, and I can also see the annoyance regarding that. The six of them are all stellar vocalists (especially Lara and Sophia), and only their dance abilities are really being showcased in their projects so far. 

I hope that HxG adheres to the desire from the fans to see more vocals from them and delivers! Also, if KATSEYE goes in a direction that contains stronger lyricism and more of a singing-heavy concept (rather than the current dance-heavy one), I would be so excited for that! I’d love to see their talent expanded on, but I’m also okay with the cheesy pop vibes that are in place now.

TL;DR: Gnarly and Internet Girl have strengths and are loved by many for the electronic, sleazy, and somewhat basic aspects.

1q32tdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaydating/comments/1q32tdh/31_germany_lets_try_this_again/,"31, Germany - Let‘s try this again!","I’ll be honest: I’ve been feeling **pretty lonely lately** — not in a dramatic way, just in that quiet “I miss having *my person*” kind of way. Someone to share the little things with, flirt with, laugh with, and actually look forward to talking to every day.

I’m here because I’m missing that *one person* you can talk to about absolutely everything — from “just one more episode” turning into a full season binge, to late-night gaming sessions where time stops existing. I’d love to meet someone I can vibe with, flirt a little, and maybe build something real if the chemistry is there.

A bit about me:

* **Gaming**: I’m down for co-op chaos, chill sessions, or friendly competition. Bonus points if you’re the kind of person who laughs when things go horribly wrong instead of rage-quitting (like I do, duuuuh).
* **Series & movies**: I can do comfort shows, thrillers, dumb comedies, or something that makes you overthink life at 2 a.m. I’m also absolutely guilty of saying “one more episode.”
* **Music**: Always listening to something — it sets the mood, fuels the day, and sometimes turns random moments into memories. Tell me what you’ve had on repeat lately.
* **Cycling**: I like getting outside, clearing my head, and chasing that “fresh air + good playlist” feeling. It’s even better with someone who enjoys little adventures.

What I’m looking for:  
Someone who’s **honest**, **funny**, and a little bit **curious**. A person who can flirt back, isn’t afraid of a genuine connection, and enjoys the small things — inside jokes, spontaneous plans, and those conversations that start as “hey” and suddenly it’s 3 a.m.

If you’re into:  
✨ playful banter  
🎮 “wanna play something together?”  
🎬 cozy movie nights (even if it’s long-distance at first)  
🚲 future ride + coffee dates  
…then we’ll probably get along.

Send me a message with:

1. your favorite game (or what you’re playing lately)
2. the last series/movie you couldn’t stop watching
3. a song you think I *have* to hear

**^(Gale Brophy)**^(- This grand dame only eats at places like Flakowitz and TooJay’s where she gets cottage cheese, cantaloupe chunks, and a double scooped bagel with non-fat cream cheese, with burnt decaf coffee. Her perfume is elegant but musty. like something that she purchased in bulk when Lord and Taylor went out of business. Gale thinks she’s cultured and worldly but as you can see Uzbekistan, Pakistan, one of those “stans.” She names drops but it’s like saying you won a Tony or Oscar in 1970, it’s kind of irrelevant in 2025. Gale says she wants to empower women but only by her standards.) 

**^(Rosalyn Yellin)**^(- the gal from Bucks County lives under Gale Brophy’s wig. There’s an identity crisis here BIG TIME. Wants to be a queen of affluence and modesty, but also wants to twerk when no-one is looking. Here’s the thing, her schtick could only work in Palm Beach, bring her to the Hamptons, Martha’s, Newport Beach, Montecito, Carmel, etc, she wouldn’t fit in. In a way and with her lipstick, she’s kind of stuck in 1980s Palm Beach and hoping for a revival.) 

**^(Ro-Mina Ustayev)**^(- She’s from Philly, but she belongs in Beverly Hills, Encino, or Irvine, CA. Obviously, her east coast roots bring her to the hot mess of South Florida. Honestly, she gives more Real Housewives of Miami but the storyline of her not being “Palm Beach” material works. Overall, gurl just wants to be Kim K.) 

**^(Maria Cozamanis)**^(- girl belongs in Miami, but easier to kick it in Ft. Lauderdale or Palm Beach. She’s in the gym at least 5 days a week and owns 20 Velour jumpsuits. She doesn’t know which path to take but is ready to party wherever she goes.) 

**^(Hilary Musser)**^(- She’s the soft power “Don” of the group. You have to give her credit for not going crazy with cosmetic work but the five marriages are always a point of discussion. You can tell she’s connected but has problems with sincere true friendships. Probably because she’s too methodical and calculated with her personality. Secretly a strong liberal from New England, but will break bread with the elite and the right if needed.) 

**^(Suebelle Robbins)**^(- this old gal reeks of Hallandale or Delray Beach. She doesn't cook and makes 6 modifications when she orders food. Also, there’s no such thing as a weekend to her, everyday is a holiday.) 

**^(Taja Abitbol)**^(- when you are at LGA or JFK at the JetBlue gate and you hear a person with a strong NY accent. THIS IS YA GIRL. Taja’s interactions with her mom are golden and yes SHE MARRIED A YANKEE!!!)   


^(BOTTOM LINE- This show is South Florida adjacent with a few Palm Beach regulars. The real Palm Beach elite only show up 8 weeks out of the year, where Polo RL, Vineyard Vines and Brooks Brothers, and don’t have time for this nonsense.)

Her birthday is coming up and I wanted to do something nice for her and invite not just my friends but she doesn’t have anyone. 

I never realised how bad it was until we moved in together and realised she is mostly home aside from the few things she does in the week. 

She’s attractive, like a 10. Strangers have stopped her on the street multiple times to tell her so. 3x in the same day when we were out together once shopping. I can tell people treat her different because of it, nicer, she gets free stuff like coffee, or small things that don’t happen to me. She’s smart (she has 2 degrees) and genuinely super kind. But she is friendless.

Absolutely zero friends. She goes to work, goes to the gym, reads, watches tv shows or movies and volunteers. I don’t understand how she’s friendless.

I have tried getting her more involved with my friends who have girlfriends but she doesn’t drink and she doesn’t come along if alcohol is involved and it just hasn’t worked. She hasn’t clicked with them.

It worries me, 2 years isn’t a long time but if we were to get engaged she would have no one to invite, except maybe her parents. Her last birthday we spent it just the two of us. She does attend things like book clubs but somehow hasn’t made any friends.

About a week ago, we started hanging out more in a group and met 4–5 times. We talked a lot, sat very close a few times, I walked her home, gave her my jacket, and bought her small things, which she appreciated. Overall, we’ve had several nice moments together.

However, from New Year’s Eve until the evening of January 2nd, we didn’t talk at all. On January 2nd around 8 p.m., I texted her asking how she was. She replied “good” around midnight. At 1 a.m., I asked her if she’d like to get a coffee and go for a walk the next day, and she replied the next morning saying she was busy. Her replies felt very dry, she didn’t ask anything back, and she usually replies or even sees my messages hours later.

The Over has cashed in 5 of Montreal’s last 6 outings, while St. Louis’ last 3 straight have seen at least 6 goals. Neither side has confirmed their goaltender at the time of writing, but it’s very likely Jordan Binnington (3.56 GAA) who’s been rough lately, and 3 of Joel Hofer’s last 4 outings have seen a higher total. Regardless of who ends up in net here, I’d take the Over to hit, friends.

1q32ph7,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1q32ph7/planning_big_island_trip_in_april_looking_for/,Planning Big Island Trip in April - Looking for Feedback!!,"Hello All!

My boyfriend and I are planning our first trip to the Big Island during the last week of April 2026. We first traveled to Oahu two years ago and loved it, so are really excited to explore a new island. After research via YT videos, reddit threads, and general google-ing, we put together an itinerary and would love some feedback on it as we continue to plan.

About Us

* We like moderate hikes, exploring new things, enjoying scenery. Things we can't see back home in NYC. Oh, and we LOVE food!
* I can't swim! Hence why anything snorkeling, swimming with manta rays, etc. are excluded from our plans. *I'm very sad about the manta rays but that's on me for not having basic life skills :)*
* We like a balance of being chill and active. Our planning style is to choose main activities we'd like to do, but leaving 1-2 days for us for flexibility and to add on anything we stumble on upon arrival. We're also not the type to jam pack our schedules.
* We don't mind paying more for quality/convenience but we also don't feel the need to go all out if we can get an experience for less, unless the $$ is that much worth it. *For example, when it comes to food, we'd rather go to a no frills joint if you tell me it's the most authentic you can get. However, if you tell me there's a more expensive spot but the money is justified by its quality, then heck yeah let's do it! You feel me?*
* We are flying in and out from Kona Airport. \[EDITED to include this info!\]

Itinerary Draft

* **Day 0:** \[Arrival Day\] Flight lands around 6pm. We plan to get the car rental, check in to our stay, grab dinner, and call it a night. Likely booking with Royal Kona Resort.
* **Day 1:** Explore Kona, shop around. Go to Mauna Kea for sunset.
* **Day 2:** Grab coffee and head out 6:30am to head to VNP. Spend a good amount of hours checking out the steam vents, lava tube, chain of craters road, etc. Leave around 3-4pm, stop by Punaluʻu Black Sand Beach and Punalu'u Bake Shop.
* **Day 3:** Explore Hilo. Go to Akaka Falls, maybe Rainbow Falls too? Get mochi from Two Ladies Kitchen and grab some shaved ice in the area. Stop by Atebara Chips.
* **Day 4:** Stop by a nearby beach in the morning. Go to a Coffee Farm Tour in the afternoon.
* **Day 5:** Massage / shopping / hike??? - let us know if there's something I've missed in my planning that could potentially fill this!
* **Day 6:** \[Departure Day\] Check out of stay, grab brekkie in the area, head to airport for early afternoon flight back home!

Foods (bolded are the one's we're super interested in trying)

* **Randy's Huli Chicken & Ribs**
* **Super J's Cafe**
* **Broke Da Mouth Grindz**
* **Cafe 100 (for the Loco Moco!!!)**
* Tantes Local Grindz
* Tetsumen Ramen
* Black Rock Pizza
* Honaunau Poke Shop
* Pine Tree Cafe

Dessert

* Mrs. Barry’s Kona Cookies - to bring back home
* **Two Ladies Kitchen**
* Malasada:
   * Manuela Malasada
   * Punalu'u Bake Shop
   * Hawaii’s Ultimate Donut
* Shaved Ice:
   * Ululani’s Hawaiian Shave Ice
   * Original Big Island Shave Ice
   * Kula Shave Ice

Additional Questions

* Stay - I've been having the biggest struggle deciding whether we should stay ONLY in Kona or book a 1-2 days stay in Volcano/Hilo (most likely Volcano), so we can minimize the long drives. While the convenience of driving less is great, it's also time consuming to check in and out from a stay. We'd have to do this twice as we'd like to be back near the airport on our last full day. I know both options are viable and that it's really up to our preferences, but any thoughts would be appreciated!
* Mauna Kea - At first I was planning on booking a $$ tour for the summit and stargazing experience given that you need a 4WD to there past the VIS. But after learning that the moon will be in waxing gibbous to almost full moon phase while we're there and that either way the tour would bring us back to the VIS for stargazing anyways, I'm reconsidering if it's worth the cost. An alternative would be that we'd just drive up ourselves to the VIS for sunset and leave it at that.
* Coffee Farm - What's the best Coffee Farm to book a tour with? So far I've seen Greenwell Farms highly recommended for their free tours. I've also seen Heavenly Hawaiian Kona Coffee Farm Tours mentioned. There's also Puna Chocolate Company Farm which is for cocoa.

I've always dreamed about meeting Taylor and taking a selfie together, so when I found this AI app that creates realistic celebrity selfies I HAD to try it 💕  
  
  
The app is called CelebCam and it actually has Taylor in multiple different styles/scenes! I chose the ""casual coffee shop"" vibe and I'm honestly emotional about how good it turned out 😭  
  
  
It's free to try (you get 5 credits) and super easy to use. Just upload your selfie, pick Taylor (or any of 200+ celebrities), and it generates in seconds.  
  
  
I know it's not real but it genuinely made my day 🥰

In case this helps anyone else I wanted to post it, and encourage you to [check your local barometric air pressure when you're having a bad pain day](https://barometricpressure.app/) to see if you can spot any pattern. 

For context, I'm 40 cis female and still have both my ovaries. I live in Canada with regular attention from doctors and specialists. Happily single and childfree, employed full time, with a multitude of comorbidities to deal with.

* I have noticed that when there's a drop of more than 30 milibars in air pressure over a short time span, my body pain skyrockets. 

* Also, 3-5 days before my menstrual cycle begins, my body pain skyrockets. 

**Put those two things together**, like today, and I'm essentially a homunculus that someone forgot in a bin with a bunch of compost, a human-shaped blob existing as the experience of first-world pain. That is to say, *I am safe and warm in my comfortable apartment with everything I need, but in a tremendous amount of pain without an immediate or fixable cause.*  

I made some infographics while drinking my first coffee, hoping that I wouldn't need to take painkillers (which I try to avoid) but eventually deciding today was definitely a write off. 

I feel lucky to be so privileged that it's Saturday, a day off, and I have the luxury of a down day to rest, while complaining on the internet. Blerg. Thanks for listening. ",4,1767466146.0,ChronicPain,4,1.0,False

Today I reached out asking if she’d like to meet again. She said she’s gotten the closure she needed and wants to move on now. This feels worse than the break up, it destroys any hope I had.

It all started at Kyle’s barbecue, which was already cursed because the grill was smoking sideways and someone brought potato salad with raisins.
That’s when my girlfriend stood up, tapped her glass, and said,
“Everyone, I’m breaking up with him.”
Silence.
Then Kyle laughed.
Not a polite laugh.
A wheezing, knee-slapping, seal-clapping laugh.
Something in my soul snapped like a dry spaghetti noodle.
That night, while doom-scrolling, I found The Extremely Questionable Book of Petty Magic. The reviews said things like “ruined my cousin’s vibe forever” and “10/10, would not recommend.”
Perfect.
I whispered the spell.
The next morning, Kyle woke up, looked in the mirror, and said,
“Why do I suddenly llovebiceps, abs and iced coffee?”
By noon he had emotionally connected with a houseplant and started calling everyone “bestie.” He wasn’t cursed in a bad way—he was just confused, fabulous, and aggressively supportive.
But the spell didn’t stop there.
His dad came downstairs wearing skinny jeans, pastel sweaters, and asking if anyone had seen his skincare routine.
His grandpa?
Crop hoodie.
Perfect eyeliner.
Doing TikTok dances with alarming confidence.
They weren’t upset.
They were thriving.
Kyle tried to apologize, but every time he did, his voice auto-tuned into pop music and backup dancers appeared out of nowhere.
Eventually he said, “Okay, okay, I shouldn’t have laughed.”
I reversed the spell… mostly.
Kyle stayed emotionally mature forever.
His dad now runs a fashion blog.
His grandpa refuses to wear anything that isn’t pink.
As for me?
I learned two things:
1.Never laugh at someone’s heartbreak.
2.Never trust a magic book with five stars and no refunds.

1.	The service at this coffee shop is stupendous. They are the friendliest, most attentive staff. Unexpected level of polite. 

2.	Their almond cake is the bomb. I love almond baked goods. Almond croissants are my go-to, so I decided to try the almond cake. Whoa. It was almost too flavorful for my almond fix, but sometimes that’s what you want.

3.	Their coffee is also delicious. I ordered a flavored drink, the Hilltopper, and what stood out to me was that you could taste the roasted nuttiness of the coffee through the flavoring. Most flavored lattes taste like milk and (say) caramel. I could actually taste the coffee.

To my surprise this is the least amount of ON pain I've been in for years. There is a possibility the pain reduction might just be from mood hormones because I do feel lifted, but here are the details:

This is my first time fasting and all I consumed during it was Himalayan salt, magnesium, tea, black coffee and ACV. To be clear zero carbs, zero sugar, zero protein and zero fat and nothing solid. I messed up not having potassium and I think that's why I couldn't make it to 72 hours.

I can report how long the pain reduction lasts but if anyone with ON already had a fast in mind maybe make it sooner then later because possibly it will help you too.

IF YOU DO DECIDE TO FAST PLEASE do your research first and prepare. Especially if you go for more the 36 hours. Our bodies needs salt, magnesium and potassium and lots of water(but not too much) and breaking your fast is a very delicate procedure of slowing introducing broth and/or easy to digest foods.

I had some belly fat always, but just stopped bothering at some point. Then I became thin effortlessly, just was active and stress free, belly disappeared. I liked walks, I would do it for pleasure. And big distances. Spontaneously. I would even eat not too healthy, but still stayed within my normal sizes. But at point I was really overworked and I had psychosis. Had schizophrenia where I would barely move and pray like for 2 years. I have gained weight. Became overweight. I understand it, it is quite normal because I was not active at all. I would eat poorly also, as I had no money. I became a person who usually would not want to move. And I don't understand what is going on. Now I am back to life, I have work which helps me stay active. I would move plenty. I eat quite balanced meals because I work at school and they give us food 3 times a day. I am often very tired after work, so I compensate with some treat and coffee before my commute home. But I am feeling that my natural activity is not increasing and the weight dropped very little, especially from the belly. The most basic answer is to diet and exercise. Stay in deficit. But I remember times when I could afford some dieting, I would be fainting from that lack of calories, I could not think, function, I was letargic and sleepy. And slept alot, even during day. Now I definitely can't afford this luxury to be walking dead for weight loss. I have a job and have to be high functioning there.

I am writing this post because honestly I'm just so confused.  
I started working with a dietician this month, and its our second week. I am attaching the list she gave me for the second week.

Breakfast

* 30 g oats
* 100 ml almond milk
* 15 g protein powder
* 1 teaspoon unsweetened peanut butter
* 1 portion of season fruits
* cacao or cinnamon for taste

during the day

* 200ml of kefir
* half a tbsp chia seeds
* black coffee
* no sugar added protein bar under 200kcal

Dinner

* 120 grams of chicken/fish/meat grilled and a salad of greens with maximum of half a tbsp of olive oils
* 2 tbsp greek yogurt
* 1 slice(25g) integral bread or 2 wasa

when you add all these up, its under 1000kcals, today was first day of following this, and i honestly felt so hungry. so i asked her why it was so low on kcal,  she accused me of not trusting her, basicly told me to use chatgpt if im not going to trust her, then told me that she doesnt want to continue working with me.

Honestly I'm in shock. I didn't mean to question her in a bad way, but i was not feeling good with this list.

For reference I'm 74kg 21f 163cm. Not doing sports but fairly active during the day.

Curious to see what you guys think, am i the asshole?

Update: Pretty sure she is a licenced dietician. She has an office and a diploma.  
To be clear this was not the first question I asked. For example she asked me not to drink coke zero, and i asked if there was an other reason than health concerns and I was stubborn about it.  Or last week I was asked for substitudes for some of the things she wrote. Maybe she was annoyed.  
She also told me that a dietician's job is not to explain the reason behind everything, but to make meal plans suitable for the clients. said that if i want to learn about it more i should get an education about it.  
After that she explained how current TDEE calculators are outdated, that dieticians have a different way of  calculating these things, and her meal plan is perfectly healthy and its not just about the calories.  
Than she paid me back half of my money and we parted ways.",26,1767465471.0,loseit,46,0.85,False

1q329aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1q329aq/how_to_grow_an_audience_from_zero_the_psychology/,How to Grow an Audience From ZERO: The Psychology That Actually Works,"
Most people think audience building is about posting more, being consistent, or ""finding your niche."" They burn out in 3 months because none of that actually works when you're starting from zero.

I spent months researching this. studied Dan Koe's entire content library, dissected growth strategies from top creators, analyzed what makes content go viral. turns out, the game has completely changed.

The truth? growing an audience isn't about volume. it's about understanding how human attention works and leveraging curiosity gaps, pattern interrupts, and psychological triggers that make people NEED to follow you.

here's what I learned from the best sources:

**Write like you're solving problems, not sharing thoughts**

Most people post random observations. ""just finished my morning coffee"" cool story bro, but why should anyone care?

Dan Koe talks about this in literally every podcast appearance. your content needs to solve a problem your ideal follower has RIGHT NOW. not someday. TODAY.

• Instead of ""productivity tips,"" write ""how I went from 14 hour work days to 4 hours without losing income""
• Instead of ""my morning routine,"" write ""the 3am habit that billionaires use to hijack their focus""
• Instead of ""thoughts on discipline,"" write ""why discipline is overrated and what actually creates behavior change""

See the difference? One makes people scroll past. The other makes them stop, save, and follow.

The key is what Koe calls ""value stacking."" every post needs to educate, inspire, or transform. ideally all three. If someone reads your content and thinks ""huh, interesting"" but doesn't DO anything, you failed.

**The 2 hour content system**

Check out ""The Art and Business of Online Writing"" by Nicolas Cole. this guy built a multi million dollar brand through writing and breaks down exactly how to systematize content creation. The book won best business book awards for a reason.

Cole's method: spend 2 hours per week batching content. Use something like Typefully or Hypefury to schedule everything. These tools analyze your best performing content and suggest optimal posting times.

Here's the actual system:
• 30 mins: consume content in your niche, save anything that triggers an ""oh damn"" reaction
• 60 mins: write 7-10 posts based on those triggers, use proven frameworks (list posts, contrarian takes, personal stories with lessons)
• 30 mins: schedule everything, engage with 20 accounts in your target audience That's it. No burnout, no ""I don't know what to post today"" panic.

**Build in public, but make it strategic**

Everyone says build in public. Most people do it wrong.

They share: ""day 23 of building my startup, wrote some code today""

Cool. Literally nobody cares about your daily standup.

What works: ""I just lost $2k testing this growth strategy so you don't have to. here's what I learned.""

The difference? One is a diary entry. The other is pattern recognition your audience can use.

Listen to ""My First Million"" podcast episodes with Shaan Puri and Sam Parr. these guys break down exactly how to share your journey in a way that builds authority instead of looking like you're screaming into the void. Their breakdown of Alex Hormozi's content strategy alone is worth binging the entire archive.

Share failures with lessons. Share wins with exact strategies. Share insights with immediate action steps. Make yourself the guinea pig so your audience doesn't have to be.

**Use the curiosity gap framework**

This changed everything for me.

Read ""Contagious: Why Things Catch On"" by Jonah Berger. Wharton professor who studied what makes content spread. The research is INSANE. Turns out virality isn't luck, it's science.

Berger found that content spreads when it creates information gaps. your brain literally can't handle not knowing, so you click, read, share.

Apply this:

• ""I studied 47 successful founders. 43 of them do this one thing nobody talks about""
• ""The $10M lesson I learned from going broke twice""
• ""Unpopular opinion: your audience doesn't want authentic, they want competent""

Each of these creates a gap between what you know and what the reader knows. They HAVE to click to close that gap.

**Platform doesn't matter as much as you think**

Stop overthinking whether to start on X, LinkedIn, or Instagram.

Pick ONE platform where your target audience actually is. Dan Koe started on X because that's where online entrepreneurs live. If you're targeting corporate professionals, LinkedIn wins. Creatives? Instagram or X.

Use Taplio for LinkedIn or Tweet Hunter for X. both apps have AI that analyzes top performing content in your niche and suggests topics. Saves you from guessing what will resonate.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia University alumni and former Google experts that creates personalized audio podcasts from expert sources. Type what skill or mindset you want to develop, and it pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to generate a custom learning plan.

You control the depth, switching between quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with examples when something clicks. The voice options are addictive, ranging from a deep, smoky tone like Samantha from Her to sarcastic styles that make complex psychology easier to digest. Perfect for absorbing content strategy frameworks during commutes or while doing other
tasks without needing to actively read.

The real secret? repurpose everything. One long form post becomes: a thread, a LinkedIn post, an email, a YouTube script. You're not creating more content, you're reformatting existing content for different contexts.

**The actual math of going from 0 to 1000**

You need roughly 100 pieces of content to hit your first viral post. That's not my opinion, that's the data. 

Most people quit at piece 37 because ""nothing's working."" You haven't earned a viral post yet.

But here's the cheat code: engage authentically with 10 accounts bigger than you daily. Not ""great post"" comments. Actual thoughtful replies that add value.

Check out ""Hooked: How to Build Habit Forming Products"" by Nir Eyal. Even though it's about product design, the psychology applies perfectly to audience building. You need to create hooks that make people come back to YOUR content specifically.

When you consistently add value in other people's comments, their audience notices. Some percentage follows you. Repeat 100 times, you have 1000 followers who actually care about what you say.

**Stop treating followers like a vanity metric**

1000 engaged followers beats 10,000 ghost followers every single time.

Your goal isn't to go viral. It's to build an audience that trusts you enough to buy from you eventually. That requires showing up consistently with genuinely valuable insights, not growth hacks.

The creators who actually build profitable startups from their audiences focus on depth, not width. They'd rather have 500 people who read everything they post than 50,000 who scroll past.

Growth comes from solving problems people didn't know they had, creating curiosity gaps they can't ignore, and building in public in a way that teaches instead of just documents. Do that consistently for 6 months and you won't recognize your metrics.",3,1767465366.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

To repot them last summer, I used a mixture of slightly acidic soil (pH 5.5-6) and perlite. I water them only when the first two to three cm are completely dry, with no water remaining under the pot. As the local water is calcareous, I use filtered water and a fertiliser for acidic plants (with both macro and micronutrients). During summer, I fertilised every two weeks, while now monthly. 

I keep the plants in front of an east-facing window, and I have recently started supplementing with artificial light (Pianta from GrowGang).

However, some plants are suffering, and I really do not know why. Based on online search, I might suppose nitrogen/magnesium deficiency but my knowledge is limited.

I really appreciate any help.

Thank you in advance.",3,1767465070.0,plantclinic,1,1.0,False

1q323dc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q323dc,Canadian Intended Parents Seeking a Gestational Surrogate,"🌼 Hello & About Us

Hello everyone, we’re Elizabeth (40) and Bruno (41) from Toronto, Ontario — married for 7 years and together nearly 20 years. We’re seeking gestational surrogacy within Canada only.

We’ve built a warm, peaceful life together in a neighbourhood surrounded by parks and walking trails, centered around family time and meaningful rituals. Elizabeth grew up with Sunday lunches hosted by her Nonna, and today we continue that weekly tradition at Bruno’s mother’s house, with many conversations, good food, and plenty of leftovers. Every fall, we honour our roots by making Italian tomato sauce (sugo) and Portuguese sausage (chouriço) — traditions we hope to one day pass on to our child.

⸻

🐾 Our Family

Our cat, Vinnie, affectionately known as Beans 🫘, is a beloved part of our lives. He brings curiosity, playfulness, and just the right amount of charm and sass into our home, and we often joke that he’s already preparing for his upcoming promotion to big brother.

⸻

💛 Our Journey

Our path to parenthood has been shaped by pregnancy loss and medical complications that made it unsafe for Elizabeth to carry a pregnancy again. Accepting that reality was incredibly hard, but it ultimately led us to surrogacy — a path we’re approaching with humility, gratitude, and deep respect for the women who make this possible.

This journey has taught us patience, resilience, and the many ways family can be built through love and generosity.

⸻

✨ Fun Facts About Us

• 🤍 We value quiet, intentional living and meaningful connections

⸻

🤍 To Our Future Surrogate

We’re hoping to connect with a kind, grounded woman who values trust, mutual respect, and open communication. We deeply respect that every surrogacy journey is unique and are committed to honouring boundaries, preferences, and what feels right for you.

More than anything, we want you to know how grateful we are for the generosity surrogacy represents.

i primarily thought id have a problem with the coffee. i drank an at home iced white mocha latte every morning and stopped cold turkey last Saturday when we began. I’ve been trying some green tea here and there, but in general i’ve just stopped the coffee and stuck to water. 

but i’ve not been paying insane attention to what i eat. i look at random high protein meals online and then make them. but are we going to see any results doing so? i feel we are essentially in a calorie deficit and preventing nighttime snacking (stopped eating our nightly strawberry special K bowls of cereal, which i miss sooo much)

i noticed the comments on the posts in this sub all say they break their fast with eggs, a handful of nuts, and like a fruit. 

we break with like a chicken wrap on low cal tortillas.  

just not sure if we need to hone in on what we are eating and make some major changes, or if i can just keep eating what i want during my eating window as long as it’s in a deficit and has good protein 

as for the coffee thing, on the weekends id like to add a coffee to my meal i break with, but should i go for sugar free creamer or can i stick with regular creamer? does that part even matter?",0,1767464996.0,intermittentfasting,5,0.5,False

Yet he grabs the largest mug, fills his whole cup, orders a large from the coffee place. I ask why he doesn’t just pour less/ order a smaller size but I really think it has nothing to do with the volume and more of a mental thing about having to leave a little bit behind.

But instead of actually cleaning, they were **dry sweeping**, which just pushed all the settled dust back into the air. The whole area became dusty in minutes.

What made it worse is that there’s an **open café right there**. People were sitting outside, having coffee and drinks, while dust was literally floating around them. No warning, no water spraying, nothing. At least they could have informed nearby shops or waited till the place was empty.

Honestly, this feels more like a **show because elections are coming up**. For most of the year, nobody bothers about cleanliness here, and suddenly a week or two before elections, this kind of late-night “cleaning” starts.

If this is how it’s done, what’s the point?

real neat
real tidy
boxes getting their vitamins
stamps doing cardio

only thing is
sometimes the scale leans

must be the lighting
right

convenience knocks

just press ok
it’s nothing

just tiny”

[$250]","I need some help deciding between the above grinders- all of which came from the James Hoffman video of grinders under $250 (linked below for those who are interested). I personally want the DF54 but we have $300 credit at Crate and Barrell which does not sell the DF54, only the others and my wife would like me to get a grinder using that credit. So here is the question- spend the extra money and buy the DF54 or use the credit and get one of the other grinders knowing it's not perfect. 

I have a bambino plus and only drink milk based drinks (usually cappuccinos) so the absolute perfect espresso shot is not important to me, but I am able to appreciate a bad shot (usually pulled from bad beans). However, I don't think I have an overly refined palate in that I usually have trouble figuring out why my coffee tastes bad (and usually just grind one or two clicks finer on my current cheap grinder) if the beans are starting to get old. I think I prefer smoother drinks rather than ones where the flavor is overly strong or bitter. I'm happy with my machine since it allows me to quickly make a good cup in the morning and this will be my grinder for the next 3-5 years as I don't foresee any further equipment upgrades. So is the DF54 worth it for my tastes?

TLDR- Should I buy a very good but not best (for me) grinder for basically free or spend money and buy (what I think is) the best grinder for $250.

Last month I got to know a hot freshman student, who I recently found out is 24.  
On Thursday 3 or 4 weeks ago, we both went to ask the professor the same question after the lecture, and before it was our turn to ask, I heard her talking to a friend of hers behind me about the professor (talking about how good and likeable he is), so I turned to them and joined the conversation. After her friend left, she asked me what my name is and what I was majoring in. (She's a computer science major, she was fairly impressed when I said I was doing a dual degree in math and computer science)  
  
The following Sunday, during one of the breaks, I was walking arouf outside and I saw her with her group of friends, so I went up to them, talked to them, joined the conversation and they accepted me as ""one of them"".  
Since then, we have talked a few times in lectures and during breaks. Her group of friends includes a gay friend who is very close to her, and a few other girls, and I sometimes join their conversations. I've invited her thrice (over 3 different days, 2 weeks ago) to study together with me for an upcoming real analysis test, and she declined repeatedly because she wanted to do her homework. She does sometimes choose to sit next to me, talk to me, and share a bit of her life. There are no obvious signs of flirting on her part, but she could just be shy.  
  
She and her friends seemed surprised when I told them I was 18, because they thought I was their age, unlike the ""atuda"" students (a program that allowes high school graduates to do their bachelor's degree- paid for by the military, before their mendatory military service), whom they recognize right away that ""they stopped being breastfed yesterday.""  
a few days ago, I answered one of her questions in the university's real analysis Whatsapp group, and a few minutes later she DM'ed me with a follow up question The next day, I told her it was me and she told me she didn't know.  
In our last conversation, during a break when I was sitting next to her and her gay friend hadn't arrived yet, she seemed relatively nervous, didn't maintain a lot of eye contact, and she tried to break silences with random small talk (like how she changed her phone because it didn't support 4G). As soon as he arrived, she was with him and I was their ""third wheel,"" so I talked to the girl sitting next to me, I was friends with her from before.  
  
It's important to note that during the semester, many people assumed I was older:  
A 26-year-old male student thought I was at least 21  
A 20-year-old female student thinks I'm 21 (I didnt tell her my age, I just said that I'm not 21)  
A 21-year-old female student thought I was 20 (the one who stood me up in the quoted post)  
My friend's (he does ""atuda"") friends asked me what year I was, and didn't assume I was a first year, meaning they thought I was at least 22  
  
I only recently found out through friends that she was 24, she herself didn't bring up her age in conversations.  
  
So assuming that I am perceived as older compared to my age, is the 6-year gap between me (18 yo man) and her (24 yo woman) still a romantic barrier, or does it depend more on the dynamics themselves than the number? And if I have a chance, what should I do now?  
We have another real analysis test coming up this Thursday, and I usually grab coffee frappe and study in the 1 hour break everyone has on Wednesdays, should I invite her? (I try to invite girls to grab coffee and study with me on Wednesdays, and usually I have higher success rates before tests lol)  
I would appreciate honest and experienced answers, even if the conclusion is that I have no chance with her.",2,1767464653.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False
1q31xwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1q31xwv/how_a_secret_job_changed_my_life_at_20/,How a secret job changed my life at 20?,"I wanted to share a story about the job I’ve been doing for almost two and a half years now. Please don't take this as a sales pitch or a ""get rich quick"" scheme... I’m not selling anything. Most people around me have no clue what I actually do, they think I’m ""in IT"" or ""customer support,"" but the reality is much more bizarre.

It all started back in 2022. I was 20, failing uni, and completely broke. You know that feeling when you're at the grocery store debating whether to buy the cheapest bread or the one with seeds because you want to feel ""high life"" for a day? I tried all the classic student jobs, but it was just back...breaking work for spare change.

Then a friend hit me up. He said, ""Hey, a Canadian agency is looking for 'account managers'... basically ghostwriters for creators. It’s not some bot farm, it’s actual high-ticket sales."" My first reaction was, ""No way, I’m not doing that."" But he explained it quickly, you’re a ghostwriter. You sell a fantasy to guys who think they’re talking to a model, but in reality, you’re the one chatting and managing the sales on the profile.

I was terrible for the first few weeks. My brain would freeze trying to come up with flirty responses. But I practiced every day, typing, learning what works with these guys and what doesn't. Eventually, I realized the job is actually insane because you’re at home, in your room, listening to music, watching shows, or gaming on the side. Your only job is to reply to messages and drive sales. I initially thought it would be hardcore adult stuff, but 90% of the models don't even do ""nudity""... it’s more about building a story and a connection.

Over time, it started feeling like a video game. I just took all the ""grinding"" and multitasking skills I picked up from gaming and applied them here to start making money.

The moment it clicked:  
I remember one shift, I was chilling with some music in the background, just scrolling through stuff, while chatting with this guy from Texas on my second monitor. The guy got totally hooked on the story we were building. In about 3 hours, I sold him content, photos, videos, and literally ""locked messages"" worth 6,000*USD*. I pulled out my calculator, figured out my commission, and just stared at the screen... I had made nearly 500 for myself in a few hours. That’s when I knew I was never going back to a ""normal"" job.

It’s been a wild ride since then, with some slumps too. Some months I’d make 1,500 EUR, other months I was pulling in 6,000 to 7,000. My record was last May when I cleared 10,000 EUR in a single month.

What changed?  
Everything and nothing. I’m still at my desk as much as I was before, I’m just working now. I started paying my parents' rent and bills, bought a top...tier PC setup, took my girlfriend out to nice dinners, and bought a car. That feeling when you can finally afford things for yourself and the people around you without checking every euro, or complaining that coffee or cigarettes went up in price again... it's priceless.

The moral side (what everyone asks me):  
Do I feel bad? Sometimes it crosses my mind that I took someone's monthly salary in a few messages. But honestly, these guys go there by choice. They want the attention, they want the fantasy, and they have money to burn. It’s far from a scam because the platform is a billion...dollar industry that is strictly regulated. I’m just the person on the other side of the screen doing my job, securing my future, and making sure the guy gets the experience he came for. It’s weird, but hey, that’s the entertainment industry.

Nowadays, I don’t chat as much. I’m more of a mentor/manager. I teach new people the ropes, analyze profit margins, and handle the technical side.

I know half of Reddit will probably roast me for this, but honestly, I’d rather do my ""secret job"" from my room for a few grand a month than haul crates for minimum wage. AMA... if I’m not asleep, I’ll answer.",2,1767464650.0,careerguidance,4,0.62,False

We’ve been friends for a long time and have lived together for about a year now. We’re pretty different when it comes to money. I make more than her and my parents help me out sometimes. It’s not like I’m hiding that or pretending otherwise. Because of that, I’ve always been okay sharing my stuff. I pay for most of the streaming services, I bought most of the kitchen stuff, air fryer, coffee machine, etc. She uses it all the time and I’ve never really said anything about it. I didn’t think it was a big deal. Last weekend we had some friends over. At some point money came up, just normal stuff like rent and groceries. Lena made a comment like “some people don’t really have to worry about money like others do” and laughed and looked at me. She didn’t say my name but it was obvious who she meant. It made things awkward and I felt kind of embarrassed.

Later on she said something else about how it must be nice to be able to buy expensive things and not stress about it. Again, clearly about me. I didn’t say anything in the moment because I didn’t want to start something in front of everyone, but it really annoyed me. The next day I brought it up and told her that if she feels that way about my finances, then I don’t really want her using my stuff anymore. I told her she can’t use my air fryer, my cookware, or my coffee machine, and I removed her from the streaming services I pay for. I also said I want us to stop sharing groceries and just keep everything separate. She got really upset and said I was being petty and overreacting to what was “just a joke.” She also said I know she can’t afford to go buy all that stuff right now and that I’m basically punishing her instead of just talking it out. I told her I don’t want to be made to feel weird or judged in my own apartment, especially by someone who benefits from my money.

Now things are super tense. She barely talks to me and some of our friends think I took it too far and should’ve just said something in the moment instead of doing all this. One friend said it feels like I’m using money to make a point, which wasn’t really my intention, but I guess I can see why it looks that way.

I still feel like I’m allowed to set boundaries with my own stuff, but I’m starting to wonder if I handled this badly. AITA?


Edit: these comments have been said before but she has said  comments like that before but that was months ago while on vacation, it isn’t frequent she’s like this and we both were middle class growing up so it’s not resentment that’s build up for years",1,1767464640.0,AITAH,36,0.56,False
1q31xlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ecoflow_community/comments/1q31xlb/its_very_expensive_to_have_an_ecoflow_system_in/,It's very expensive to have an Ecoflow system in Brazil.,"I was researching portable power stations for backup and camping, and I ended up falling into the bottomless pit that is the price of EcoFlow in Brazil. I know that ""everything in Brazil is expensive,"" but the distortion in these specific products is downright offensive.
I decided to do a quick comparison to get an idea of ​​the size of the markup we pay here, converting the Brazilian values ​​to dollars and seeing what you could buy abroad with the same money.
The scenario is heartbreaking.
Example: EcoFlow DELTA 2
This is one of the most popular stations, the ideal ""middle ground"" for many people.
🇺🇸 Price in the USA: Frequently on sale for US$ 419 - US$ 499.
🇧🇷 Price in Brazil: Varies between R$ 7,600 and R$ 8,500 (official distributors/large retailers).
Let's take an average of R$ 8,000 here in Brazil.
With the dollar at ~R$ 5.50, those 8 thousand reais are equivalent to approximately US$ 1,450.
What can you buy in the US with the value of ONE Brazilian Delta 2 (US$ 1,450)?
If you had those same US$ 1,450 in hand at a Best Buy or Amazon in the US, instead of just buying one battery, you would buy:
3x EcoFlow Delta 2: Yes, you would buy THREE units of the same station and still have change left over for a coffee.

Elite Gamer Combo: A PlayStation 5 Pro (US$ 700) + An iPhone 16 (US$ 799). Okay, it would go over the budget by about 50 dollars, but it's a console and a state-of-the-art cell phone vs. a battery.

MacBook Air M3: You can get the 13"" or even the 15"" model and still have money left over for AirPods Pro.
Complete Camping Ecosystem: An EcoFlow River 2 Pro + 220W Solar Panel + Starlink Kit Standard + Premium brand 12v portable refrigerator.
Another example: EcoFlow River 2 Pro
For those who want something smaller.
🇺🇸 Price in the USA: ~US$ 339 (approx. R$ 1,860 in direct conversion).
🇧🇷 Price in Brazil: ~R$ 4,800.
The amount we pay here (converted to about US$ 870) is enough to buy a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra on sale abroad or assemble a very competent entry/mid-range gaming PC.
Why is that?
Beyond the obvious ""Brazil Cost"" and profit margin, the tax classification of these products is brutal. They enter a cascade of taxes (II, IPI, PIS, COFINS, ICMS) that often doubles or triples the original value. But, even knowing this, it's hard to swallow that the markup reaches almost 350% in some cases compared to the promotional price abroad.

This is a rant. It's disheartening to try to have even a minimum of energy autonomy or cutting-edge equipment while living here.

Has anyone here imported directly (Forwarder/Paraguay) or found a national alternative that doesn't cost an arm and a leg?",1,1767464629.0,Ecoflow_community,0,1.0,False

Ladies, gentlemen, and fashionable beings of all stripes, gather 'round as we part the polyester curtains of time to behold history's chicest choo-choo train making a triumphant return to station Today's Fashion - choo choo! That's right, the vintage styles are steaming back into our collective wardrobe, and I, for one, am not mad about it. Not in the slightest.

- **Flares are Flaring Up!** The Seventies called, they want their flares back—except we're keeping them this time. Our skinny jeans might be skinny-mourning as they slid out of the limelight, allowing bell bottoms to swing triumphantly from our knees once more. I'm not skirting the issue, the wider the better!

*Polka Dots and Platforms* - Go on then, admit that part of you is thrilled at the return of polka dots. And those platform shoes? Disco heaven. I won't judge if I catch you busting a move on the sidewalk; it's only natural. We're bringing Saturday night fever to Monday morning coffee runs, babes.

**Bold Prints - Bodacious!** Call in the audacity squad because the prints are getting bold again. Remember your grandma's wallpaper? It's now on a shirt, and it looks fantastic. Hawaiian shirts aren't just for theme parties; they're a declaration of sassy and laid-back fashion sovereignty.

- *The Return of the Vest* - Once confined to the realm of magicians' assistants and poker dealers, the vest is back as expert layering piece. Layer it, flaunt it, make it the star of your outfit or the demure understudy – versatility is the vest's best virtue.

*Accessories that Pop!* - If the necklace isn't potentially usable as a medieval flail, is it even an accessory? Go chunky or go home. Granny's huge glasses aren't just for reading anymore; they're a statement. And let's not skimp on the scarf—you can use it as a picnic blanket in a pinch, after all.

And finally, my dear trend rebels and connoisseurs of retro, let's not forget the most essential piece of this sartorial puzzle: **attitude**. Half the panache of pulling off a bygone era's ensemble is strutting like you invented time-travel just to school the present in the forgotten art of fabulousness. Own those high-waisted trousers like you own the roadmap to yesterday's 'it' factor!

Are we recycling, or are we onto the Echo-echo-echoes of Style? The circle of fashion life continues to amuse and delight as we twist, tweak, and twirl yesterday's looks into today's head-turners. So, what say ye, oh avant-garde adventurers? Yea or nay to the return of the groovy getup gallant? Speak now or forever hold your peacocking plume!",1,1767464604.0,FashionFuture,0,1.0,False

1q31uvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1q31uvy/how_to_be_more_confident_the_sciencebased_guide/,How to Be More CONFIDENT: The Science-Based Guide That Actually Works.,"Okay, real talk. Confidence isn't some magical personality trait you're born with. It's not reserved for extroverts or people who look a certain way. I spent years thinking I was just ""naturally insecure,"" watching other people walk into rooms like they owned the place while I was stuck overthinking every word that came out of my mouth. Then I went down a research rabbit hole, reading everything from psychology studies to neuroscience books to podcast interviews with people who've literally studied human behavior for decades. And here's what I found: confidence is a skill. You can build it. Here's how.

## Step 1: Stop Waiting to ""Feel"" Confident

This is the biggest myth about confidence. People think they need to feel confident before they act confident. Wrong. **Action creates confidence, not the other way around.** Social psychologist Amy Cuddy's research on power poses shows that when you act confident physically, your brain chemistry literally changes. Your cortisol (stress hormone) drops and your testosterone (dominance hormone) rises.

Translation? Fake it till you become it. Stand tall. Make eye contact. Speak clearly. Your brain will catch up. The feeling follows the action, not before it. Start small. Walk into your next meeting like you belong there, even if your inner voice is screaming that you don't. Do it enough times, and that voice gets quieter.

## Step 2: Kill the Comparison Game

Your brain is wired to compare. It's an evolutionary survival mechanism. But in today's world, where everyone's highlight reel is plastered all over social media, comparison is a confidence killer. You're comparing your behind the scenes to everyone else's curated performance.

Here's the fix: **Stop consuming content that makes you feel like shit.** Unfollow accounts that trigger your insecurities. Limit your social media time. When you catch yourself comparing, redirect. Ask yourself, ""What can I do today to become 1% better than yesterday?"" That's your only competition. You versus yesterday's you.

Dr. Brené Brown talks about this in **The Gifts of Imperfection**. She's a research professor who spent decades studying shame and vulnerability. This book will make you question everything you think you know about worthiness. She breaks down how shame thrives on comparison and secrecy, and confidence grows when you embrace your imperfections instead of hiding them. Insanely good read if you're tired of feeling like you're not enough.

## Step 3: Build Competence in Something (Anything)

Confidence comes from proof. You can't just tell yourself you're confident and expect it to stick. You need evidence. Pick one thing, get good at it, and watch your confidence bleed into other areas of your life.

It doesn't matter what it is. Learn a language on Duolingo. Hit the gym consistently. Master a skill at work. The act of setting a goal, working toward it, and seeing progress creates a **competence loop**. Your brain goes, ""Oh shit, I can actually do hard things."" That feeling is addictive.

Psychologist Albert Bandura called this **self-efficacy**, the belief in your ability to succeed. The more you prove to yourself you can handle challenges, the more confident you become in tackling new ones.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by experts from Columbia University and Google that creates personalized audio content from quality sources like research papers, expert interviews, and books. Type in what you want to work on, maybe improving social confidence or communication skills, and it generates a custom podcast and adaptive learning plan just for you.

You control the depth, switching between a quick 10-minute overview or a 40-minute deep dive with examples when something really clicks. The voice options are ridiculously good too, from calm and soothing to energetic when you need that push. Perfect for learning during commutes or workouts without the usual doomscrolling. Makes structured self-improvement way more realistic for people actually trying to grow.

Another option is an app like **Ash** to track your progress. It's basically a relationship coach for yourself. You log wins, process emotions, and build self-awareness. Sounds cheesy, but tracking small victories rewires your brain to notice your growth instead of your failures.

## Step 4: Talk to Yourself Like You're Not Your Own Enemy

The way you talk to yourself matters. A lot. Most people have an inner critic that's brutal, mean, and relentless. You'd never talk to a friend the way you talk to yourself. Neuroscientist Dr. Ethan Kross wrote **Chatter**, a book about the voice inside your head and how to control it. He explains that negative self-talk isn't just annoying, it literally hijacks your brain's ability to perform.

Start noticing your self-talk. When you mess up, do you say, ""I'm such an idiot"" or ""That didn't go well, but I'll adjust""? The second one is self-compassion. It acknowledges the mistake without destroying your identity.

**Reframe your inner dialogue.** Instead of ""I can't do this,"" try ""I can't do this yet."" That one word, ""yet,"" is powerful. It shifts your mindset from fixed to growth. Confidence grows when you believe you're capable of learning and improving, not when you think you're already perfect.

## Step 5: Expose Yourself to Rejection (On Purpose)

This one sounds insane, but hear me out. Fear of rejection is one of the biggest confidence killers. You don't speak up in meetings because what if people think you're stupid? You don't ask someone out because what if they say no? You don't apply for that job because what if you're not qualified?

**Rejection therapy** is a real thing. The idea is to deliberately put yourself in situations where you might get rejected, so you realize rejection isn't the end of the world. Jia Jiang did this and wrote **Rejection Proof** about his 100 days of seeking rejection. He asked strangers for the craziest things, like borrowing $100 or getting free burgers. Most said no. Some said yes. And he realized rejection didn't kill him. It just made him bolder.

Start small. Ask for a discount at a coffee shop. Compliment a stranger. Request something slightly outside your comfort zone. The more you expose yourself to ""no,"" the less power it has over you.

## Step 6: Surround Yourself with People Who Lift You Up

Your environment shapes you more than you think. If you're around people who constantly doubt you, criticize you, or make you feel small, your confidence will tank. Period. You can't out-think a toxic environment.

Audit your circle. Who makes you feel capable? Who drains you? **Spend more time with the first group.** Join communities where people are building themselves up. This could be online forums, local meetups, fitness classes, whatever. Just find your people.

Motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, ""You're the average of the five people you spend the most time with."" If those five people are confident, driven, and supportive, you'll become that too. If they're negative, stagnant, and fearful, guess what you'll become?

## Step 7: Accept That Confidence is a Practice, Not a Destination

Here's the thing nobody tells you: confidence isn't something you achieve once and keep forever. It fluctuates. Some days you'll feel like a rockstar. Other days you'll feel like a fraud. That's normal. The goal isn't to feel confident 24/7. The goal is to **act despite the fear.**

Mark Manson talks about this in **The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck**. He's brutally honest about how self-help culture sells the idea that you need to feel amazing all the time. Spoiler: you don't. Confidence isn't about feeling good. It's about doing the thing even when you feel like garbage. He won the Goodreads Choice Award for this book, and honestly, it's one of the best reality checks you'll ever read about building real, unshakable self-belief.

Keep showing up. Keep taking action. Keep proving to yourself that you can handle discomfort. That's how confidence becomes your default, not just a fleeting feeling.

## The Bottom Line

Confidence isn't about being perfect or fearless. It's about showing up, taking action, and proving to yourself over and over again that you can handle whatever comes your way. Stop waiting to feel ready. Start acting like the person you want to become. Your brain will follow.",1,1767464452.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False
1q31uuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Themepark/comments/1q31uuo/report_back_two_adults_four_disney_world_orlando/,"Report back: Two adults, four Disney World Orlando parks in one day, and it was actually pretty fun (though exhausting)","I decided to take my husband to an Orlando theme park last minute while we were in central Florida visiting family, and I visited this sub for input while agonizing between Universal and Disney. I’d never been to Universal and hadn’t been to Disney in a quarter century, and the husband had never been to either, but some resources users shared in this sub (namely the website that predicts crowd sizes by date and the links to the digital apps) wound up really useful for planning.

Since we were already in Florida just for the holidays, I chose the date that was predicted to have the lowest crowds during this period, and because I’m not a big coaster person and the weather wasn’t ideal for big water rides, I wound up deciding last minute to do the single day Disney park hopper to increase our options. At $275 per person it was most definitely not cheap, but that served as incentive to maximize our time, which I feel like we did pretty well.

Notably, while early middle-aged adults we’re both in relatively good shape, and I doubt it would have been possible to do something like this with either kids or physical disabilities. Regardless, we wanted to prioritize rides (vs. shows or too much aimless wandering) without paying for an express or lightening pass or expensive hotel, and while taking the free transport options between parks, and I’m pretty pleased with how it went. Below is what we did:

Animal Kingdom

\- Avatar Flight of Passage

\- Everest

\- Kali River Rapids

\- Dinosaur

Hollywood Studios

\- Star Wars Rise of the Resistance (ate a surprisingly good lunch while standing in line, as this was the longest)

\- quick walk through Galaxy’s Edge in entirety (it was gorgeous!) followed by sit-down coffee break

\- Smugglers Run

\- Tower of Terror

Epcot

\- Walked through all countries except for UK, US and Canada. Grabbed a snack in Morocco and stopped for activities in China and Mexico.

\- Test Track

\- quickish sit-down dinner

Magic Kingdom

\- Haunted Mansion

\- It’s a Small World

\- Jingle Cruise

\- Pirates of the Caribbean

\- Space Mountain

\- Tron LightCycle

During all this we encountered three lines that were between 1-1.5 hours, but the rest were all less than an hour, and a lot were very quick. (We also made use of a couple of single rider lines.) In total this itinerary took 16 hours and I absolutely wouldn’t want to do it often, but it was also fun - the new ride technology is amazing and I felt like a kid again. Best of all, my husband who started as a theme park skeptic also had a great time and is now excited to go back and try Universal some time. (We decided we’d like to do IoA when it’s warm enough for water rides and/or Epic on a slower day.)

Planning took work but I feel satisfied it mostly worked out, so happy to answer some questions if I can!",3,1767464450.0,Themepark,2,1.0,False

I put the SMD2470ASY through my usual real kitchen routine, installed in a base cabinet near the prep zone, same spot I see most islands and peninsulas set up for.

Drawer design and placement is the whole point here. The drawer glide feels smooth, opens wide, and the low height makes grabbing mugs and hot liquids a lot safer than an over the stove unit. Accessibility features are legit too: shorter users and older folks dont have to lift above shoulder level, and you can see inside without tip-toeing. Interior capacity is 1.2 cu ft, which is fine for dinner plates and reheating bowls, but this isnt the “big casserole dish” champ, and the 24 inch width choice matters if your cabinetry is 30 inch.

Ease of installation is mixed. It’s 74 lb and awkward, so plan on two people and verifying the cutout. Folks have mentioned swapping from an older Sharp drawer with similar dimensions without reworking the cabinet, which tracks with what I see in the field. Control panel visibility is good once you know it: the concealed control panel tilts open and the digital LCD is readable, but it can feel hidden if youre used to a keypad always staring at you. User interface experience is simple enough, no fancy app stuff, just the buttons you need.

Cooking consistency at 950 watts is decent, not the fastest heating speed compared to higher watt countertop microwaves, but still practical for leftovers and coffee. Auto defrost performance is acceptable for frozen meat, though I still pause and flip halfway because thats reality. Noise level is normal for a drawer microwave: fan hum, a solid thump on open/close, nothing alarming.

Build quality feels sturdy in the stainless steel shell, yet reliability and longevity is the part that makes me skeptical. One buyer reported “noise but not heating” out of the box, and another replaced an older unit after keypad failure, so I’d test it immediatly after delivery even if your remodel timeline drags. Warranty and service sounds repair-oriented, not replacement-friendly, and getting a tech can be a hassle depending on your area.

Cleaning and maintenance is a win. No greasy over-range exposure, wipe-downs are quick, and the stainless interior doesnt trap odors much. Energy efficiency is typical microwave territory, but the price is the real rub: it lands way above boring countertop competitors, and you’re paying for the drawer form factor and aesthetic integration more than raw performance. Value for money only pencils out if the built-in look and the safer, lower loading height are priorities.",1,1767464443.0,KitchenStack,0,1.0,False

We’ve been friends since college, and moving in together seemed like a no-brainer… until I realized she has this talent for making everything feel like *my* fault.

It started small: she’d “borrow” a shirt, a hair tool, my good coffee, whatever. I’m not possessive, so I didn’t care at first. I just asked that she tell me before taking stuff and replace what she uses up.

She’d say, “Of course, babe,” like I was being silly.

Then it got weird.

I’d go to get ready and my straightener would be gone. I’d ask, she’d say she didn’t touch it. Then I’d find it in her room, still warm. Same with my skincare my expensive moisturizer kept “running out fast.” My laundry detergent. My razor refills. Even my earrings started disappearing and reappearing in places I *know* I didn’t put them.

I tried to handle it like an adult. I said, “Hey, it’s stressing me out not being able to find my things. If you’re using them, it’s fine just tell me.”

She got instantly defensive: “Wow. So you think I’m stealing?”

I said, “I think we’re roommates and stuff gets mixed up. I’m just asking for communication.”

She agreed. For about a week.

The breaking point happened last weekend. I had a wedding and I was running late. I go to grab my one “special occasion” perfume (it was a gift and I’m super careful with it), and it’s not in my drawer. I tear my room apart. Nothing.

I ask her, “Hey, have you seen my perfume?” She says, annoyed, “No? Why would I take your perfume?”

So I’m panicking. I’m already dressed, makeup half done, hair curling, and now I’m digging through everything. Then I remember: she had friends over the night before and they were getting ready in the living room.

I check her room (I know, I know but I was desperate). And there it is on her dresser. Not only that, but the bottle is half empty. Like… noticeably.

I walk out holding it and I’m like, “It’s literally right here.”

She immediately flips it: “Ew, why are you going through my room? That’s such a violation.”

I said, “You literally looked me in the eye and said you didn’t have it. I’m late to a wedding and you’re sitting here with my perfume on your dresser.”

Then she hits me with, “Okay, I borrowed it ONE time. You’re being dramatic.”

I said, “Borrowing is when you ask. This is you taking my things, lying, then acting offended when I find them.”

She starts crying. Full tears. And says, “You make me feel unsafe in this house.”

Unsafe… because I found my own perfume?

That night, she posted a vague story on Instagram about “toxic people” and “living with someone who invades your privacy.” Our mutual friends saw it. One of them even messaged me like, “Hope everything is okay at home…”

So I finally snapped. I sent her a message (calm but firm) saying: from now on, my room is off limits, my things are not communal, and if she needs something, she can ask. I also said I won’t be “covering” for her anymore when she tells people she “doesn’t know” where my things are.

Now she’s acting like I’m the villain, saying I’m “controlling,” “stingy,” and that I “embarrassed” her. But I feel like I’m losing my mind living with someone who takes my stuff and then gaslights me about it.

1q31tdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1q31tdg/an_amateur_reviews_sorce_and_odette_parfum_samples/,An Amateur Reviews Sorce and Odette Parfum Samples,"I'm entirely new to the perfume scene! I've always loved vanilla scented items, but I had never been interested in exploring mainstream perfumes because they all seemed to have a specific underlining scent which I disliked and entirely too many celebrities marketing them. However, I recently discovered indie & niche brands and fell in love with the storytelling concepts! I was drawn to Odette Parfum Co's theming with her ballet & Parisian inspiration, and Sorce's gourmand reputation. 

This was my first sample purchase, and I selected based on a combination of notes and theming. If a scent doesn't have a pretty name, I don't want to try it 😌

Potential Likes: VANILLA, cinnamon, fireplace smoke, lemon, rice, gourmands

Potential Dislikes: Lavender, cherry

*Disclaimer: My untrained nose can’t pick out many notes and my ratings are entirely subjective.*

\~

**Sorce**

\~

**English Major**

*Official Notes: library books, orris absolute, marshmallow, decalepis absolute (sustainably harvested), carrot seed, sandalwood, fallen leaves \*earthy gourmand*

Thoughts: Ink & sugared sweetness. It feels like sniffing a vial of dip pen ink inside of a super sweet candy store with tons of brightly colored hardened sugar confections. When I first sampled it upon arrival, I got whiffs of fireplace smoke and something reminiscent of walking down a crunchy leaf strewn path in autumn, but those would turn out to be very ephemeral; I never smelled them again. On every subsequent try, it’s been candy sweet and inky, and I have wanted to scrub it off.

2/5

\~

**In Dreams and Fairytales (Vanilla)**

*Official Notes: Baked vanilla meringue, vanilla bean absolute, sugar, a sprinkle of chamomile \*gourmand vanilla* 

Thoughts: The exact aroma of the Honeydukes store in Hogsmeade at the Universal Theme Park. A synthetic, artificial sugar-sweet scent. It’s like a sugary hard candy if it was made of plastic. This made me question if I really know what vanilla smells like because if this is perfumed vanilla, I'm not a fan. It has the same underlying overly sweet DNA as English Major, and they dried down very similarly on my skin. Almost a little baby-powder esque. No one is more sad about this than me as this is the fragrance name of my dreams. 

2.5/5

\~

**Moon Magic**

*Official Notes: Lavender sugar, vanilla steamed milk, chai spices, tonka bean, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight (our crystal accord) \*spiced gourmand*

Thoughts: Should I, with lavender as one of my only two known scent dislikes, have bought this scent sample? Probably not, but my love for chai surpassed my reason. Smells like a store that sells crystals and tarot cards sans the incense that I often encounter in those establishments. An essential oil lavender crystal-y scent. It smells a little like laundry detergent directly from the bottle, not yet diluted on clothes. After letting it rest for several weeks, I got faint whiffs of the chai spices, but it’s mostly drowned out by the lavender to my nose. Not for me.

2/5

\~

**2am in Lafayette**

*Official Notes: Vanilla co2, oakmoss, cafe au lait, ribbons of caramel, beignets dusted with powdered sugar \*earthy gourmand*

Thoughts: Lovely! It opened with a strong edible gourmand scent - reminiscent of a baked good that I couldn’t quite pin down, not a beignet, but something yummy. Almost like a bread-y pretzel (but without butter). After a few moments, it settled into the lovely aroma of a brown sugar milk tea. Syrupy boba and brown sugar with an undercurrent of salty, breadiness. On subsequent wears, the opening was more coffee forward and the dry down caramel, maple syrup. I don’t detect any of the oakmoss. Overall, I like this scent a lot, although it’s a little heavy sometimes! 

4.5/5

\~

**Odette Parfum Co.**

\~

**Fantôme de Forêt**

*Official Notes: Top (Ginger Lily, Smoked Vanilla Salt), Middle (Tobacco Blossom, Immortelle, Honey Amber), Base (Birch Wood, Oakmoss, Sandalwood, Copal)*

Thoughts: This scent is inspired by the second act of the Giselle ballet, and I selected it entirely because of that. Sweet, woody, creamy, powdery. I’m not sure how it’s all of those adjectives at once, but it really is. The woods are sweet without any greenery. The trees aren’t a real forest but on a stage. It’s like standing in the wings of a ballet production with wafts of makeup powder and the soft woody notes of props that are just a little sweeter than they should be – like a bit of the magical nymph forest come to life. 

4/5

\~

**Pas de Chat**

*Official Notes: Top (Madeleine Cake, Pink Pepper), Middle (Kitten Fur, Cashmeran, Iso E Super), Base (Amber, Vanilla Bean, Ambrette Musk, Tonka Bean)*

Thoughts: Mostly amber & cashmere to my nose with an undercurrent of something musky. Smells like the Target Being Frenshe Cashmere Vanilla body mist. A cool, sophisticated girl would wear this, but that girl isn’t me. It’s like a vintage coat in an antique store or sifting through a fashionable older woman’s closet for the old bin of winter scarves in the back corner behind her winter jackets which still hold faint remnants of expensive perfume.

One of my cats emits the most comforting smell in existence. He’s like a warm, fuzzy stuffed animal come to life, and I selected this sample hoping it might bottle that magic. The second time I tried wearing this sample, my cat was in my lap, and when I brought my wrist to my nose, I detected something fuzzy. My heart leapt, and I thought I’d perhaps found the scent of my dreams after all until my nose started to itch, and I reached up to find several of his hairs that had hitched a ride after I gave him a hug… I never did detect the kitten fur note in the scent itself.

3/5

\~

**Nuit D'été**

*Official Notes: Top (Lemon Sorbet, Elemi, Moonflower), Middle (Night-blooming Jasmine, Primrose Whipped Cream, Mandarin Jam Cake), Base (Cedar, Blanc Musk, Amber, Vanilla Bean, Rosewood)*

Thoughts: At first sniff, pure MAN. Like a tigerambermuskicewarrior scent. It’s inspired by the ballet version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream which does indeed have men in it, but the men must be *really* close to me and doused in cologne. My friend compared it to a Hollister store. However, after letting it rest for an additional two weeks, I received the surprise of my life. Lemon sorbet melted in a moonlight forest. Something green related to mint, but not quite, like rubbing your fingers on a herbaceous leaf and sniffing it. A whimsical garden with a lemon tree and star jasmine climbing up a wooden trellis. Sometimes I get a slight whiff of an astringent household cleaner, but then it fades away, and I feel crazy.

4/5

\~

**Petit Gateau**

*Official Notes: Top (Honey Marzipan), Middle (Chantilly Cream, Brown Butter), Base (Toasted Tonka Bean, Bruleed Vanilla)* 

Thoughts: Cherry medicine cough syrup… In the vial, it smells like a lovely spiced cake. On my skin, it’s artificial and medicinal. My guess is the marzipan is pulling cherry on me instead of almond, and fear of this happening again might scare me away from almond notes in the future. 

1.5/5

\~

**Ending Thoughts:**

House wise, Odette seemed to have better longevity overall than Sorce on my skin and retained a distinct smell for longer. The lingering scent from several of the Sorce fragrances was the same candy-sweetness despite the different notes.

I had a lot of fun trying out my first samples! I don’t plan to upsize any of these right now as I have so many more scents to try, but I do plan to revisit 2am in Lafayette in the future as either another sample or travel size bottle. With a whimsical name and a yummy scent, it checks both of my fragrance boxes :)

I’m not sure what houses I'll try next or which notes I might gravitate towards, but I have my eye on Wylde Ivy, Alkemia, and Poesie as potential options. I’m still looking for my dream vanilla perfume with a poetic concept and name!!

I made an simple web app for myself a while ago to track my pushup progress, but recently thought that maybe it would be helpful for someone else. You can find this here: [https://13pushups.free.nf](https://13pushups.free.nf)



Problems:

1: I was always tracking my pushups in Excel. The problem was switching between the Excel and Timer apps. Instead of resting, I was clicking on the phone.  
  
2: I like to do pushups not only in the regular training but also in additional random sets during the day. Again, Excel wasn't very comfortable for me to update.



Features:

* You can set your annual goal. For example, 50k pushups for 2026.
* On the main page, you can add every set you made and use the timer at the same time.
* You can track your progress, lifetime stats, and additional charts with weekly average stats.
* You can mark the set as:
   * Free shot - random set done by day eg. waiting for a coffee,
   * Training - reps done by regular training,
   * Test - your test set when you want to mark your max.



**The app is free, with no ads,** so if anyone wants to try or needs an app to track pushup progress, I will be happy can help you with this app.

As I mentioned above, I made this for myself, but if you want to add some features or have any ideas, let me know. I willingly improve this app.

Hi guys! I work from home and deal directly with foreign clients. It’s flexible and convenient, but I’ve realized I don’t really have friends here who are in the same kind of setup. Most of my work, problems, and routines are very different from a typical office or BPO schedule, and it sometimes it can feel isolating. 

I’m hoping to connect with people in Bacolod who are also freelancing, working remotely, or running online work for overseas clients. Not really looking for anything formal or “networking"" haha, just genuine connections. It would be nice to hangout over coffee, cowork, or just talk about WFH life, clients, money, or even burnout with people who actually get it.

I’m introverted and not usually the type to initiate new connections, so posting this honestly feels a bit awkward haha. But expanding my circle is one of my goals for 2026, and I figured this was worth a try.
