My OBGYN said that while it's not a common experience, it's also not unheard of, and he said that this is what labor will feel like. It's been a couple weeks since the D&C and my bleeding stopped. I started exercising more (just walking) and being sexually active again. I had really bad cramps again yesterday, not like my normal period cramps. I also started getting ""lightning crotch.""

But what does it take to make a successful pivot? I've curated a list of real-world examples and insights from successful founders and entrepreneurs who've navigated the pivot space.

Here are 7 Lessons from Successful Pivot Strategies:

1. **Know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em**: Starbucks' failed coffee machine venture taught them the importance of recognizing when to pivot and when to hold off.

2. **Get feedback, get creative**: Rethink.io's pivot from an app development agency to a virtual event company was catalyzed by user feedback and an innovative solution to a growing problem.

3. **Stay focused on core values**: Carpooling platform Waze's pivot from a general navigation app to a GPS-based traffic navigation system stayed true to its commitment to innovation and user experience.

4. **Don't be afraid of radical changes**: Skype's pivot from a peer-to-peer file-sharing platform to a video conferencing tool demonstrates the power of embracing bold new directions.

5. **Be open to new markets and users**: 37signals (now Basecamp) pivoted from a software development company to a project management platform, expanding its market reach and user base.

6. **Maintain a growth mindset**: Facebook's pivot from a college-only social network to a publicly accessible platform shows the importance of adaptability and willingness to evolve.

7. **Embrace failure as an opportunity**: Groupon's pivot from a daily deals platform to a more sustainable, locally-focused business model exemplifies the value of learning from failures and using them as stepping stones to success.",1,1742508217.0,u_Helpful_ruben,0,1.0,False

1jg0zlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jg0zlt/obsessing_over_the_most_beautiful_necklace_i_ever/,Obsessing Over the Most Beautiful Necklace I Ever Purchased,"It‚Äôs so beautiful.

How it shines in the light, casting exotic reflections that dance across the room. How precise the white gem is carved into the shape of a man, each detail so lifelike it seems to breathe. How the white gold chain was beautifully forged, its links interwoven with an artistry that defies comprehension.

This was by far my best purchase ever. The moment I saw it at a jewelry street stand in the middle of nowhere, under the pale moonlight, I knew I had to have it. I had never seen anything so exquisite, so mesmerizing.

The hooded man who sold it to me practically gave it away. A mere hundred bucks for something so exquisite felt like a steal. He even tried to sweeten the deal with a fantastical story about how the necklace was discovered in the Arctic by explorers, locked away in a metal chest. But honestly, I couldn't care less about its origins or the tale behind it. All I knew was that I had to have it. The moment I laid eyes on it, nothing else mattered. So I paid the man, all the while ignoring his stories, and left.

That was two hours ago. It‚Äôs midnight, and I lay in my bed, jewelry in hand, my gaze fixated on it. How could I take my eyes away from it?

Its beauty speaks to me in so many ways. Like the painstaking work in making such intricate links in the white gold chain, each one a testament to the artisan's skill. Or the way the reflections off the gem seem to change color, creating an illusion of the carved man dancing gracefully. How the same carved man seems to speak silent words whenever I rotate the gem, whispering secrets that I wish I could hear. 

Sometimes, when I spin the necklace around, the man carved from the gem seems to come to life. His arms and feet appear to move, performing a delicate dance. At times, I could swear I see him tilt his head and shift his body, as if acknowledging my presence. He appears so happy, almost jubilant. Just as happy as I am holding this exquisite piece of jewelry. 

As I gaze at the gem, envy washed over me. I wish I could be as beautiful as the carved man. My own reflection in the mirror shows the very opposite. Acne scars from my teenage years mar my face. My body is far from the ideal; I am overweight, my clothes straining against my frame. My hair is thinning, with bald patches becoming more prominent each day. My eyes, once bright, now seem dull and tired. The gem's beauty only highlights my own imperfections, making me yearn for a transformation, a chance to escape my mundane appearance. I long to shed this skin, to become something more, something worthy of admiration.

As I continue to stare at the gem, I began to squint as I can see a reflection of myself in the gem, but it's not the same me. This reflection is a perfect version of myself‚Äîflawless skin, a lean and toned body, thick, lustrous hair, and eyes that sparkle with life. This idealized version of me seemed to flawlessly fit the gem carved as a man. It moved gracefully, as if it has a life of its own, without the necklace moving or rotating. It dances and gestures, exuding confidence and beauty, everything I wish I could be. 

Another two hours passed. I am still lying on my bed, still fixated on the necklace. I hear a knock on the door, the entrance to my rather small one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment. This is the first time I broke my gaze from the necklace and instead focused it on the door.

I approached the entrance door to my apartment and looked through the peephole. No one was there. Assuming they must have knocked on the wrong door, I walked back towards my bed to rest and resume my gaze upon the exquisite necklace and the gem.

To my surprise, the carved man was absent from the necklace, its main centerpiece. I began to look for it frantically, thinking that I must have somehow accidentally broken it off from holding the necklace too tightly.

Then I heard another knock at the door. Frustrated by the interruption, I rushed to the door and looked through the peephole again, only to find the shadow of a person walking past my door. I opened the door and looked down the right hallway where the shadow appeared to walk towards and saw the figure of a man turning around the corner. He looked very familiar. Maybe it was one of my drunk neighbors not knowing where they were, or a prankster knocking on random doors. Though I had never experienced either. I thought nothing of it and continued to search for the carved man that had fallen off the necklace.

However, I didn‚Äôt feel the necklace in my right hand this time. I must have placed it somewhere without realizing it when I was distracted by the knock. Now even more frustrated, I looked for both the necklace and the carved man with renewed vigor. I searched on my dining table, end tables, coffee table. I inspected the couch, including under the pillows and underneath it. I checked the bedroom again, including underneath the bed and under my sheets. All that effort resulted in nothing.

Frustrated beyond belief, I was about to restart my search in the living room until I heard that same knock on the door. I cursed under my breath and stomped towards the door, this time ignoring the peephole and placing my hand on the handle. But something stopped me from opening the door. I don‚Äôt know why, but I felt uneasy this time. The people in this building are practically harmless and I live in a safe, quiet neighborhood. This apartment complex requires a fob to enter the main entrance, so this should filter out all the non-residents.

I checked the peephole and saw presumably the same familiar man from before standing right in front of the door with a smile on his face. He looked familiar, but I couldn't place where I had seen him before. His smile, though, unsettled me.

As I continued to stare, I began to notice details that seemed oddly recognizable. His skin was smooth and unblemished, free from any imperfections. His body was lean and toned, the clothes fitting him perfectly, accentuating his ideal physique. His hair was thick and lustrous, cascading down in rich waves. His eyes sparkled with life and confidence.

A sense of unease grew within me as I observed him. There was something about his features, his posture, his very presence that tugged at my memory. The way he stood, the way he smiled‚Äîit all felt familiar.

Then, I noticed the necklace around his neck. It was beautiful, extremely beautiful. The chain seemed wrought by white gold with masterfully crafted interwoven links. But it seemed like it was missing something. Maybe a pendant or a gem.

I immediately stepped away from the door with a huge surge of fear and adrenaline. That‚Äôs when I realized that the necklace he was wearing was the one I had been searching for in the last few hours. That was mine. But how? How could he have stolen it from my apartment? It‚Äôs impossible.

I looked through the peephole again, finding that the man was still there. He hadn‚Äôt moved and still maintained that same God-awful smile. Wait. That smile. That smile complemented with a single dimple on his left cheek. That‚Äôs how I look when I smile.

Oh God. Is that me? Is that a perfect version of me, standing right behind that door?

I ran to my bathroom and faked a smile. It matched the guy‚Äôs smile. I looked at my hair, my eyes. Both were a good match, except his were gorgeous.

It‚Äôs me but perfect. How? Why?

My thoughts were interrupted when another knock came from the door. I immediately rushed to the living room, took a chair, and wedged it at the door, hoping that it would make it difficult for anyone to break in and enter. Then I took my phone and dialed 911 while maintaining my gaze at the door. All I heard was static.

I looked at my phone and saw the time was 10:14 p.m. I checked my wall clock. 10:14 p.m. How can that be? I used my banking app to search for the timestamp of when I purchased the necklace, considering that‚Äôs approximately when I got home. 10:14 p.m.

Fear took over me. I dropped my phone. This seems crazy to me. Did time stay still? What the hell is going on?

Before I could crouch down to pick up my phone, I saw an arm effortlessly pass through the door. The arm was pale and slender, moving with an eerie grace. Then a leg followed, stepping through the solid wood as if it were mere air. The leg was perfectly formed, clad in elegant trousers that seemed to shimmer in the dim light. Slowly, the rest of his body emerged, each movement fluid and deliberate. His torso, dressed in a finely tailored shirt, slipped through the door without resistance. Finally, his head appeared, crowned with thick, lustrous hair that framed his flawless face.

The man seemed to have walked through the door, all the while smiling, as if he were a ghost.

I ran to my bedroom and locked the door. I screamed at the top of my lungs, demanding that he should leave before I either called the cops or hurt him out of self-defense. But we both knew that my threats carried no weight. My phone was in the living room, and the only weapon I had on hand was my desk lamp.

Makeshift weapon in hand, I stood but six feet from the door. I mustered all the courage I could to prepare myself for anything that I might see. Then I saw him again, walking through my door effortlessly, his movements fluid and ghostly. His smile remained, unwavering and unsettling, as he passed through the solid wood as if it were mere air.

I dropped my makeshift weapon, screamed in fear, and sprinted to my bed, hiding under my sheets. I prayed to God, hoping that I would be safe and make it out alive, knowing deep down that I wouldn‚Äôt.

Hours, or what seemed like hours, passed while I waited. The suspense was killing me, so I decided to peek through my bedsheets. No one was there. The sun was illuminating my bedroom through the window. The threat looming over me seemed to have vanished.

What a beautiful day!

I whistled happily as I got out of bed and prepared myself for the workday ahead of me. Everything from the night before seemed like such a blur. I don‚Äôt recall why I was afraid. I picked up my phone and checked for any messages. Nothing. Any previous calls while I was asleep? Nothing. Everything seemed to be fine.

I walked to my bathroom and inspected myself in the mirror. No blemishes. Check. No balding spots or imperfections in my hair. Check.

The necklace around my neck seemed to have dulled in beauty, though. How unfortunate. I could swear that the carved man represented the image of a perfect man, not this slightly overweight person with what looked like rough imperfections all around it. What a mistake it was for me to buy this thing. I must have been fooled by the lack of light due to nighttime conditions.

I was about to dump the necklace into the trash bin, but something stopped me from doing so. I wasn‚Äôt sure what. As I looked at it again, I noticed that the expression of the carved man seemed sad, depressed, despairing even. This made me pause.

I decided to wear the necklace once more.

Maybe he will see the life that he should have been living a long time ago. Only this time, with me at the helm.

But I'm at my wit's end, and I would really value some advice. Does anyone recognize my experiences?

I get so overwhelmed by sound, I can panic when I'm having coffee with a friend and can no longer filter out what people are talking about around me. It makes me want to just get up and leave.

I can hyperfocus for hours if it's something I find interesting, and I can only truly relax when I concentrate completely on something. I learn things really quickly when there's a logical system behind them, like painting or languages.

I hate eye contact, it's so intimate I can only stand it with a partner. Colleagues are completely out of the question for more than a quick glance for politeness' sake, and even with siblings and parents I find it very, very hard. I have a high IQ (whatever that's good for, except seeming self-important) and I find systems thinking and logical abstraction very easy, which helps my job as a project manager, but it's also my only way to approach and understand my own emotions. 

I'm often stressed when people talk. I listen more for the general information content than the words, and when the general message is apparent, I just wait for them to use all the words they feel the need to say before they're done. I understand that saying these things would make me very unlikable, and I do care about not making people feel bad.

When my wife got very sick, or I when I realized that my dad may not have much time left, I get very confused. I understand logically that these things make me sad, but it feels like I lack a part of the code key to understand the feelings I experience in real time. When I cry or experience strong emotions, it's often very delayed reactions, or out of exasperation and frustration. I often feel anxiety about scenarios that never happen.

Sometimes when I drink alcohol, I feel very normal after a few drinks, and this scares me a lot. It feels like ""Oh, this must be how the world is designed to be experienced"",  because it just makes sense to interact with it 'as is', on face value, without constantly thinking about the implications of absolutely everything. I don't like being drunk, but I'm afraid of getting too fond of being slightly tipsy.

It feels like there's something really wrong with me. I'm not a genius or anything like that. But it feels like I got the chance to be slightly smarter than average at the price of being put together in the wrong way. Not sure that's a good trade.

I'm really sorry if this offends someone with real problems. But I feel really lonely, and I wonder if anyone else has felt like this. ",1,1742507969.0,aspergers,0,1.0,False

If you're practicing intermittent fasting (IF), you might be wondering: Can I eat fruits during my fasting window? 

üö´ During Fasting Window: Avoid fruits (or any calories) to maintain the fast. Consuming fruits, even healthy ones, breaks your fast because they contain natural sugars and calories.

üçá During Eating Window: Fruits are a fantastic choice! Packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber, they‚Äôre a great way to refuel and nourish your body.

üçì Low-Glycemic Fruits: If you‚Äôre mindful of sugar intake, opt for low-glycemic fruits like berries, apples, or pears during your eating window.

üíß Stay Hydrated: If you‚Äôre craving something sweet during your fasting window, stick to water, herbal teas, or black coffee to stay on track.

My boyfriend and I live together and a few months ago he shoved me on the ground. I was being like belligerently angry about a name he called me and even said ‚Äúcome at me bro‚Äù so I probably shouldn‚Äôt have said that but I honestly did think he actually would‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even remember what started the fight, he grew up in a family from what I understand like a super mean but not violent dad. So, I take the very cruel name he called me and excuse it as a learned behavior and not how he really feels. 

So ok, nothing happens for a while and I reason that the shove thing was my fault, and apologize to him (I think I apologized the next day but more than once for sure). Then like 3 weeks ago we got in some other trivial fight.. I‚Äôve been telling him it makes me feel lonely to do everything alone (ever since he started working he stays in his office which is in the house like all day every day including the weekends). I made plans with him a week in advance to go to the grocery store. The day comes and he picks a fight with me and I‚Äôm like great he doesn‚Äôt want to leave the house so he‚Äôs doing this‚Ä¶ try to stay calm we‚Äôre still going. Then I use the bathroom before we go, 3 mins tops, he says I was in there too long and he‚Äôs not going anymore. I got so pissed I turned the internet off. It was a Saturday and he was watching soccer it‚Äôs not like he was in the middle of a zoom board meeting you know? But still a very annoying thing to do‚Ä¶ 

He freaks out. Chases me upstairs, backs me into my closet and starts like knocking stuff off all the shelves and stuff. And I‚Äôm telling him if he physically hurts me I‚Äôm going to call the police this time. So instead he threw a coffee in my face, I was shocked. I turned the internet back on. But now the Apple TV isn‚Äôt working or something so he takes the redbull I had in my hand and pours it on my head‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm trying to fix the Apple TV and he‚Äôs like heckling me. At one point he takes my medicine and opens the top and throws it all over the ground so I‚Äôm now on my hands and knees picking it up as he continues to again call me this name (cumrag‚Ä¶ he knows a guy in high school called me that and how much it hurt my 17 year old self‚Äôs feelings. He also knows I‚Äôve been SA‚Äôed) like he is intentionally using my trauma against me. 

We really haven‚Äôt been the same since, because I haven‚Äôt. For whatever reason the coffee in my face was just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never had someone throw a drink on me..  and I‚Äôve never had the instinct to do it to anyone else. I thought that was reserved for people who didn‚Äôt grow up in very nice upper middle class suburbs but suppose I was mistaken 

I have been talking to others about this and everyone is telling me it‚Äôs not OK, it will get worse I need to leave. But I don‚Äôt want to sell my house so I‚Äôd have to legally evict him‚Ä¶ so, anyways, I‚Äôm just hoping beyond hope that this is something we can go to therapy for and get through. 

From a guys perspective, if you‚Äôre doing that, do you think it‚Äôs possible to change? The science says no but I‚Äôve also changed so much myself in the past year and a lot of people wrote me off so I don‚Äôt want to do that to him, if he‚Äôs willing to like see that it‚Äôs wrong. 

He refuses to call it abuse. He said the things I said to him when I was on my hands and knees picking up my meds was abuse. It was some really mean shit I intended to hurt my feelings and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been meaner to anyone but I‚Äôve also never been physically bullied before‚Ä¶ 

I said that I admit the things I said were abusive they were intended to hurt his feelings and I didn‚Äôt mean them (I have told him this many many times and also taken actions to the contrary of what I said so he feels my remorse). 

He will not call what he is doing abuse. He keeps saying I‚Äôm the abusive one. But like therapist and stuff say that‚Äôs what an abuser would say and he‚Äôs not gonna change. 

I have a therapy appointment tonight and this weekend so I‚Äôm just honestly asking dudes not for advice on how to handle it but like do you think it‚Äôs even possible to recover from this? If he‚Äôs shows me that he recognizes the behavior is wrong I can forgive him but without that I feel uneasy. 

Last night he said I make people want to punch me in the mouth. This was cause I asked him to please just call it abuse, cause I called what I said abuse. And then I asked him if he wanted to punch me in the mouth and he refused to answer‚Ä¶

At this point I am actually starting to be afraid of him. Before I wasn‚Äôt because he was like changing his bipolar meds and you know I just thought since like 7 months had passed we were beyond it. Now he says not even pushing me was abuse, and that I make people want to abuse me. But that he doesn‚Äôt, the logic doesn‚Äôt really make sense but trust me pointing that out makes it worse‚Ä¶.. 

Please don‚Äôt be mean to me and downvote me for this I really just want men who are willing to answer to answer and if not maybe can you keep scrolling?

- Triglycerides: 132 ‚Üí 77 mg/dL  
- Lipoprotein(a): <10 nmol/L (normal: <74 nmol/L per Quest Diagnostics)  

My LDL had been around 130 for at least the past four years. I didn‚Äôt take any meaningful action because I thought it wasn‚Äôt that high. That changed last year when I had my ApoB tested for the first time and got a result of 114. That was my wake-up call. I started researching more and realized it was time to take this seriously.  

To be fair, my diet was already considered ""good."" I avoided added sugar and junk food, and I always take the skin off chicken. Since I have a family history of type 2 diabetes later in life, I kept an eye on my carb intake. However, I completely overlooked my saturated fat intake.  

Dietary Changes:  
I started cooking all my meals at home, weighing everything on a kitchen scale, and logging everything in Cronometer to get an objective view of my macros, saturated fat, and fiber intake.  

My daily targets (on a ~2500 kcal diet):
- Saturated fat: <11g  
- Fiber: 40‚Äì50g  

Breakfast:
- 50g rolled oats  
- Sliced apple and/or banana  
- 1 tbsp ground flaxseed  
- 10g sunflower seeds or 5g pumpkin seeds  
- 10g raisins, prunes, or sun-dried apricots  
- 25g nuts (I avoid high-saturated-fat nuts like cashews/macadamias)

WAY TO WATCH Brazil vs Colombia LIVE STREAMS ON TV CHANNEL Reddit,"Hey FIFA World Cup Qualifiers (CONMEBOL) fans. I've been wanting to watch more Brazil vs Colombia lately, but most online links I've found either skip frequently or are lower quality. I don't mind paying for Brazil vs Colombia 2025 live full schedule and medal events, but they blackout local games (which is 2 teams for me) and all nationally televised games (Peacock TV, Fubo, Sling, TNT & ABC). I refuse to pay basically double or more just to get those channels and just for FIFA World Cup Qualifiers (CONMEBOL) games.

I have good Internet and a good PC if that matters. I just wanna watch Brazil vs Colombia stream games in good quality without paying over $300 a year. Any advice is appreciated.

What app/website are you using to watch the Brazil vs Colombia 2025 Streams live free? ... I'm not 140% it's basically a live stream of the Brazil vs Colombia 2025 live Games Streams.

Colombia will travel to Brazil on Thursday having lost each of its last two 2026 World Cup qualifiers. Watch the game live and for free on Fubo today.

Brazil will leap back in front of Colombia in the race to qualify for the 2026 World Cup provided it beats La Tricolor at the Arena BRB Mane Garrincha in Brasilia on Thursday evening. Both teams have failed to win either of their last two qualifying matchups, though Brazil‚Äôs form at least appears to be on an upward curve after a dismal stretch of results towards the back end of 2023. And it was amid that barren run that Colombia managed to overcome the Selecao in the reverse of this fixture, emerging as a 2-1 victor in Barranquilla to mark its first win over Brazil since 2015.

Colombia coach remains undefeated against Brazil in two attempts as a head coach, having also drawn 1-1 against the South American giants when they faced off in last year‚Äôs Copa Am√©rica.

The stakes are a lot higher this time around, however, as the Coffee Growers sit fourth in CONMEBOL qualifying on 19 points, a single point ahead of Brazil in fifth place

It was during the group stage of the 2024 Copa Am√©rica that Colombia came from behind to secure a 1-1 draw against Dorival Junior‚Äôs side en route to topping their pool.

Brazil failed to hold onto its lead as a half-time leveller from Crystal Palace defender Daniel Munoz secured a 1-1 draw for Colombia the last time these countries faced off:

More than 15 years have passed since Brazil last failed to beat Colombia in three consecutive meetings, never mind losing twice to this foe in such quick succession.

Brazil was close to having Neymar back after a 17-month lay-off, but injury has since forced the Santos star to withdraw as Real Madrid forward Endrick comes in as his replacement.

Meanwhile, Jhon Duran has retained his spot for Colombia after a prolific run since moving to Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr, while captain James Rodriguez will hope to keep having an impact on the international scale.

Similar to gameproofer. Looking at the TechDisc, I can see that it gives you hyzer angle and nose angle. To my understanding, hyzer angle is the angle made with the ground on release, from the axis upon which the disc moves after release (forward/backward axis). To my understanding, nose angle is the angle made with the ground , from the axis perpendicular to release (side to side axis). To sum up: I think of hyzer as how much side to side tilt, and nose angle as how much up/down tilt (pouring the coffee). 

I understand how you'd measure nose angle when thrown with no hyzer. However, when you ""pour the coffee"" and then add hyzer, what exactly is the nose angle being measured against? For example, if you tilt the disc forward to have downwards nose angle (lets say 10 degrees), and then tilt the right side up, left side down to have hyzer (lets say 30 degrees), what is the nose angle measured against to get the angle? An imaginary plane that exists parallel to the disc if you just had it at 30 degrees hyzer with no nose angle?

  
Hope that is understandable. Very confused on how to measure these metrics independently of one another.",0,1742507292.0,discgolf,5,0.5,False
1jg0msn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jg0msn/anxiety_panic/,Anxiety panic,"What caused my anxiety panic and palpitation

Main cause is Gastric which is triggered by not eating at the correct time, smoking and excessive coffee 

When you are almost empty stomach and when you drink a lot of coffee and smoke and then when you eat very late the gastric strikes which leads to heart palpitation which leads to overthinking of something wrong with your heart and then the anxiety and panic attack starts to occur which makes you feel terrible and unsettling, once the panic attack is triggered it comes and goes occasionally which is so annoying and when you realize that it is just a panic attack from nowhere you start to act accordingly to settle down quickly without any anxious 

To get to an understanding of this it took me more than five months. 
I still go through this hoping it will disappear someday.

And I‚Äôm hoping if we can find the root cause for our anxiety and panic, we might find a solution to calm ourselves down, remember our brain is so powerful that it can overcome any problems if we take good care of our health ",2,1742507263.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

Hi guys,
 
I rent a room out at a house with two other female college students. The house is owned by one girl‚Äôs dad, and she lives there/manages the place and the tenants. I rent the bigger room in comparison to the other roommate and pay more, a couple hundred below the cost of a one bedroom apartment in the area, which is no issue with me. I was told from the beginning that she wanted a clean, respectful, and quiet roommate. She let me know the other roommate works part time at a coffee shop and works early mornings so I should be mindful of that, which is no big deal because I do too. In the beginning she established that after 9 PM was quiet hours and I should refrain from things like talking on the phone, loud tv, or clacking dishes in the kitchen. No problem. 

I‚Äôve been here since mid January and haven‚Äôt had any issues or complaints from her or the early rising roommate. Two nights ago I got home from an evening class I take at a further away campus because I need it but it‚Äôs not offered at my college in the spring. I like the unique machines at the fitness center on campus and work out before class, then eat and shower when I get home. The class is my only evening class just once a week and ends at 8:45 pm, then as I mentioned it‚Äôs kind of far so I have to drive home. I got home, ate, and showered like normal. Once I got dressed I realized I got a text from the landlord roommate asking me not to shower after 9 pm anymore because it was too loud. 

It didn‚Äôt sit right with me and the more I thought about it, the more unreasonable it seemed. Realistically I could shower before that time on most days and I do, and I could shower at the gym on that one day, as long as I packed all my shower stuff and got to the campus extra early. But should I have to? I also work varying hours, have a social life, go to the gym daily, and attend study sessions at whatever times work for others in my classes. I don‚Äôt want to have to balance all this on my mental load AND try to figure out when I can shower. Additionally, on the weekends, no gym around me is even open past 9pm so if I get caught up in life events and can‚Äôt make it by then, I‚Äôm just out of luck. I ran the shower and closed the door from the outside and I don‚Äôt really see how it‚Äôs loud‚Ä¶it sounds normal to me. 

I understand being mindful of others trying to sleep and stuff but I feel like I pay enough to be able to shower whenever the hell I want. I am considering asking her what about the shower is too loud ( I don‚Äôt play music, knock a bunch of bottles over, or anything really, and I don‚Äôt take long showers) and telling her that I can try to shower earlier in the day as often as possible but that my schedule changes from semester to semester and it‚Äôs unreasonable to restrict when and how I use the bathroom.

A while ago, I (30M) asked a woman, Jane (unknown age, F) out on a date and got rejected because she already has a boyfriend (Brian, unknown age, M). She is a regular at a coffee shop that I visited. Even though  she rejected me, we stayed as friends and are on good terms. I hanged out with her every once in a while.

A few days ago, Jane was in a car accident - she lost control of her car and crashed it into a tree. She didn't have any life-threatening injuries but she still had to go to the hospital. When I found out about this, I made her a get well soon card and went to the hospital to give it to her. Brian was also there and when he saw me with a card, he demanded that I show it to him. After seeing it, he talked to me in private and said ""I don't know what's wrong with you, but Jane already rejected you and I'm her boyfriend, not you. Don't try to start anything with her"".

I explained to him that I made the card because we're friends and that's what a good friend would do. I have no romantic intentions whatsoever. He told me ""She already rejected you, that means she wants nothing to do with you. Stay away from her"". I told him that's not true as she hanged out with me in the coffee shop. I also told him that he's being very controlling and he should let her have the agency to decide who to hang out with. 

So, AITA for making the card? Just because she rejected me doesn't mean we can't be friends, and I just wanted to be a good friend so I made the get well soon card.",1,1742507183.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

üî• What Makes This Server Different? üî•

We built a one-of-a-kind timed progression system that unlocks weapons, armor, and raiding gear at set intervals ‚Äì no more early wipe rocket raids or full kit PVP on day one.

üîπ Research ANYTHING ‚Äì but you can‚Äôt craft it until it‚Äôs unlocked.
üîπ Workbenches are OPEN ‚Äì plan ahead, prep gear, stay ready.
üîπ Dynamic Loot Tables ‚Äì event loot scales with progression to stay balanced.
üîπ Guarded Crate Event ‚Äì the only extra plugin, where the winner gets an exclusive weapon BEFORE it‚Äôs officially unlocked.
üîπ Shared Blueprints ‚Äì play with your squad, share your tech, dominate together.
üîπ 10-Minute Nights ‚Äì because let‚Äôs be real, nobody wants to play ""Rust but I‚Äôm blind.""
üîπ Drones at All Safe Zones ‚Äì because running to Outpost is for peasants.
üîπ Merged Outpost + Tunnel Entrance ‚Äì fast travel? Say less.
üîπ Offline Raid Limiter (Coming Soon!) ‚Äì One offline raid per team per day. Offline roam raiding has gotten out of hand, and while we don‚Äôt want to remove it completely (because it‚Äôs Rust), we‚Äôre working on limiting it so it‚Äôs less punishing and more strategic.

TL;DR: No more speedrunning endgame, no more wipe-day chaos. Just balanced, strategic Rust.

David sat at the small desk in the corner of the living room, his laptop open and a stack of textbooks beside him. He had missed a few classes recently, and the weight of unfinished assignments and looming deadlines pressed heavily on his mind. He needed to catch up, especially after the disruptions caused by Charlotte.

As he typed away, trying to focus on his work, Emma walked into the room, her hair tied up in a messy bun and a bright smile on her face. She was wearing one of David‚Äôs hoodies, the sleeves rolled up to her elbows, and she looked as carefree as ever.

‚ÄúHey, David,‚Äù she said, her voice cheerful. ‚ÄúWhat are you up to?‚Äù

David glanced up, his expression one of mild surprise. ‚ÄúOh, hey, Emma. I‚Äôm just trying to catch up on some schoolwork. I‚Äôve missed a few classes, and I‚Äôm behind on a couple of assignments.‚Äù

Emma tilted her head, her smile widening. ‚ÄúOn a Saturday? Come on, David, it‚Äôs the weekend. You should take a break. How about we do something fun today? Just the two of us.‚Äù

David hesitated, his eyes flicking back to his laptop. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to, Emma, but I really need to get this done. I‚Äôve missed a few lessons‚Äù

Emma leaned in closer, her hand resting on his arm. ‚ÄúDavid, you‚Äôve been working so hard lately. Don‚Äôt you think you deserve a break? Just one day to relax and have fun?‚Äù

David hesitated, his eyes flicking to hers. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, Emma. I really need to‚Äî‚Äù

Emma cut him off with a wave of her hand, her tone sweet but firm. ‚ÄúCome on, David. It‚Äôs just one day. You can work on Sunday, right? Today, let‚Äôs do something fun. Just the two of us.‚Äù

David‚Äôs resolve wavered as he looked into her eyes. They were warm and inviting, and the way she was rubbing his arm sent a shiver of warmth through him. He wanted to say no, to focus on his work, but the thought of spending the day with Emma was too tempting to resist.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he said finally, his voice quiet. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll work tomorrow. Today‚Ä¶ today, we can do something fun.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs smile widened, and she leaned in, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the best, David. I promise, you won‚Äôt regret it.‚Äù

As Emma walked away, her steps light and carefree, David sat there for a moment, his mind swirling with unspoken thoughts. He wanted to feel excited about spending the day with Emma, but the weight of his unfinished work made it hard to relax.

‚ÄúDavid,‚Äù Emma said, her voice bright and cheerful, ‚Äúcan you grab my shoes from the closet and help me put them on?‚Äù

David hesitated for a moment, his mind still preoccupied with the assignments he had pushed aside for the day. But the way Emma looked at him‚Äîher eyes warm and inviting, her smile playful‚Äîmade it impossible to refuse. He nodded and walked over to the closet, his steps slow and deliberate.

As he knelt down in front of her, holding her shoes in his hands, Emma leaned back on the couch, her expression one of mild amusement. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she said, her tone casual, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to do something really fun today. I think you‚Äôre going to love it.‚Äù

David‚Äôs heart lifted slightly at her words. Despite his worries, the thought of spending the day with Emma filled him with a quiet sense of excitement. He carefully slipped her shoes onto her feet, his movements gentle and precise. ‚ÄúWhat are we doing?‚Äù he asked, his voice quiet but hopeful.

Emma‚Äôs smile widened, and she leaned forward slightly, her eyes sparkling with mischief. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going shopping.‚Äù

David blinked, his excitement faltering slightly. ‚ÄúShopping?‚Äù he repeated, his voice tinged with uncertainty. He had imagined something more low-key, like a walk in the park or a quiet lunch. Shopping wasn‚Äôt exactly his idea of fun, but he didn‚Äôt want to disappoint Emma.

Before he could say anything, Emma reached over and picked up his smartphone from the coffee table. David‚Äôs eyes widened, and he instinctively reached for it. ‚ÄúEmma, what are you doing?‚Äù

Emma held up a finger, pressing it gently against his lips to silence him. ‚ÄúShh,‚Äù she said, her tone playful but firm. ‚ÄúJust let me do this, okay?‚Äù

David froze, his heart pounding as he watched her unlock his phone using his face. She swiped through the apps quickly, her fingers moving with practiced ease, until she found what she was looking for. ‚ÄúAh, here it is,‚Äù she said, her tone satisfied. ‚ÄúYour Wallet app. We‚Äôre going to need this today.‚Äù

David‚Äôs stomach churned with unease. ‚ÄúEmma, I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think‚Äî‚Äù

Emma cut him off with a wave of her hand. ‚ÄúRelax, David. It‚Äôs just for today. I‚Äôll pay you back, I promise.‚Äù She tapped a few more times on the screen, her expression focused, and then held the phone up to David‚Äôs face again. ‚ÄúThere,‚Äù she said, her smile widening. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve added my fingerprint to your phone. Now I can unlock it whenever I need to. Isn‚Äôt that convenient?‚Äù

David stared at her, his mind swirling with a mix of emotions‚Äîconfusion, frustration, and a deep, aching sense of helplessness. He wanted to argue, to tell her that this was crossing a line, but the way she looked at him‚Äîher eyes bright and her smile warm‚Äîmade it impossible to say no.

‚ÄúIs it okay if I hold onto your phone today?‚Äù Emma asked, her tone sweet but with a hint of expectation. She didn‚Äôt wait for an answer, standing up and walking toward the door, his phone still in her hand. ‚ÄúCome on, David,‚Äù she called over her shoulder, her voice bright and cheerful. ‚ÄúTime to have some fun.‚Äù

\--

The mall was bustling with activity, the air filled with the hum of conversation, the clatter of hangers, and the occasional burst of music from nearby stores. David followed Emma into a large clothing store, his steps slow and deliberate as he tried to keep up with her energetic pace. She moved through the aisles with purpose, her eyes scanning the racks of clothes as if she were on a mission.

‚ÄúThis is going to be so much fun,‚Äù Emma said, her voice bright and cheerful as she pulled a dress off the rack and held it up to herself. ‚ÄúWhat do you think, David? Does this color suit me?‚Äù

David glanced at the dress, his mind elsewhere. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ yeah, it looks nice,‚Äù he said, his voice quiet and distracted.

Emma smiled, her eyes sparkling with excitement. ‚ÄúGreat! I‚Äôll try it on.‚Äù She grabbed a few more items from the rack‚Äîa blouse, a skirt, and a pair of jeans‚Äîand headed toward the fitting rooms, her steps light and carefree. ‚ÄúWait here, okay? I‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äù

David nodded, his shoulders slumped as he watched her disappear behind the fitting room curtains. He walked over to a small seating area near the entrance and sat down on one of the chairs, his hands resting on his knees. The chair was uncomfortable, the hard plastic digging into his back, but he didn‚Äôt complain. He knew this was part of the deal when shopping with Emma.

As the minutes ticked by, David‚Äôs boredom grew. He glanced around the store, taking in the bright lights, the colorful displays, and the other shoppers milling about. A few feet away, a young couple was laughing as they held up a ridiculous-looking hat, and David couldn‚Äôt help but feel a pang of envy. At least they were having fun.

He reached into his pocket instinctively, his fingers brushing against the empty space where his phone usually was. His heart sank as he remembered that Emma still had it. He wanted to check the time, scroll through his messages, or even just play a game to pass the time, but he couldn‚Äôt. He was completely disconnected, left to sit there and wait.

David sighed, running a hand through his hair. He glanced toward the fitting rooms, but there was no sign of Emma. He leaned back in the chair, his eyes drifting to the ceiling, and tried to think of something‚Äîanything‚Äîto distract himself.

After what felt like an eternity, Emma emerged from the fitting rooms, her arms laden with clothes. She walked over to David, her smile widening as she held up a blouse. ‚ÄúWhat do you think of this one?‚Äù she asked, her tone eager.

David glanced at the blouse, his mind still elsewhere. ‚ÄúIt looks nice,‚Äù he said, his voice quiet.

Emma‚Äôs smile faltered slightly, and she tilted her head, her expression one of mild concern. ‚ÄúAre you okay, David? You seem‚Ä¶ distracted.‚Äù

David forced a weak smile, though his heart wasn‚Äôt in it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Just‚Ä¶ a little bored, I guess.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs expression softened, and she reached out, placing a hand on his arm. ‚ÄúOh, David, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôll try to hurry, okay? But I just need to try on a few more things. You don‚Äôt mind, do you?‚Äù

David hesitated, his frustration bubbling just beneath the surface. He wanted to tell her that he did mind, that he was tired and bored and just wanted to go home, but the look in her eyes stopped him. Instead, he nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast.

Emma‚Äôs smile widened ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the best, David. I‚Äôll be back soon, I promise.‚Äù

As she walked back to the fitting rooms, David just sat there; waiting.

As the minutes ticked by, David‚Äôs frustration grew. He glanced toward the fitting rooms, but there was still no sign of Emma. He leaned back in the chair, his eyes drifting to the ceiling, and tried to push down the unease bubbling inside him.

Emma emerged from the fitting rooms with a stack of clothes draped over her arm‚Äîdresses, blouses, and a couple of new pairs of jeans. She walked over to David, who was still sitting on the uncomfortable plastic chair, and ruffled his hair playfully. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm done in this store,‚Äù she said, her voice bright and cheerful. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go pay.‚Äù

David stood up, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast, and followed her to the checkout counter. The cashier, a young woman with a friendly smile, began scanning the items, her movements quick and efficient. As the total appeared on the screen, David‚Äôs eyes widened. The amount was much higher than he had expected, and his stomach churned with anxiety.

The cashier looked up, her gaze shifting between Emma and David. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be ‚Ç¨247.50,‚Äù she said, her tone polite but with a hint of curiosity. ‚ÄúHow would you like to pay?‚Äù

David hesitated, his mind racing. He glanced at Emma, hoping she would take the lead, but she was already reaching into her bag and pulling out his phone. She unlocked it with her finger and opened the Wallet app, her movements smooth and practiced.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll pay with this,‚Äù Emma said, her tone casual as she held up the phone and scanned the Payconiq code. The payment went through with a soft¬†*beep*, and the cashier handed her the receipt.

David‚Äôs heart sank as he watched the transaction complete. He wanted to say something, to protest, but the words stuck in his throat. Emma turned to him, her smile widening as she held up the bags of clothes.

‚ÄúOh, David,‚Äù she said, her tone sweet but with a hint of mischief. ‚ÄúThank you so much for these clothes. How do you think they look on me?‚Äù

David forced a weak smile, though his heart wasn‚Äôt in it. ‚ÄúThey look great on you,‚Äù he said, his voice quiet.

Emma‚Äôs smile widened, and she tilted her head, her expression one of mock innocence. ‚ÄúYou know, I could pay you back‚Ä¶ or you could just let it go. Since you think they look so good on me, maybe it could be a gift? What do you think?‚Äù

David‚Äôs cheeks flushed with embarrassment, and he glanced at the cashier, who was watching the exchange with a curious smile. The cashier chimed in, her tone light and teasing. ‚ÄúWow, that would be quite the gift from your boyfriend. Very generous.‚Äù

Emma laughed, her voice bright and carefree. ‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs not my boyfriend. Just my housemate.‚Äù

The cashier raised an eyebrow, her smile widening. ‚ÄúWell, if a guy ever bought me something like this, I‚Äôd be over the moon. That‚Äôs quite the gesture.‚Äù

David stood there, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast, feeling like a deer caught in headlights. He wanted to protest, to tell Emma that he couldn‚Äôt afford this, but the weight of the situation‚Äîand the cashier‚Äôs expectant gaze‚Äîmade it impossible to speak up.

Finally, he nodded, his voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs okay. You don‚Äôt have to pay me back.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs smile widened, and she leaned in closer, her tone teasing. ‚ÄúWhat was that? I didn‚Äôt hear you.‚Äù

David took a deep breath, his cheeks burning. ‚ÄúI said‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have to pay me back.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs eyes sparkled with amusement, and she threw her arms around him, pulling him into a tight hug. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the best, David!‚Äù she exclaimed, her voice bright and cheerful. She pressed a quick kiss to his cheek before pulling back and handing him the two heavy bags of clothes. ‚ÄúHere, hold these for me. I‚Äôm in the mood for a coffee now. Come on, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

She snapped her fingers and gestured for him to follow, her steps light and carefree as she walked toward the exit. David stood there for a moment, the weight of the bags pulling at his arms, his mind swirling with unspoken thoughts. He wanted to feel happy for Emma, to share in her excitement, but the weight of the situation‚Äîand the lingering anxiety about his finances‚Äîmade it hard to relax.

As they walked out of the store, Emma turned and waved at the cashier, her smile bright and carefree. The cashier waved back, her expression one of mild amusement, and David followed behind, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast.

David walked behind Emma, the bags of clothes heavy in his hands, his mind swirling with a mix of emotions‚Äîfrustration, embarrassment, and a deep, aching sense of helplessness. He wanted to stand up for himself, to tell Emma that this wasn‚Äôt okay, but the look in her eyes‚Äîbright and carefree‚Äîmade it impossible to say no.

The coffee bar was cozy and inviting, the air filled with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation. Emma led David to a small table near the window, her steps light and carefree. She set the bags of clothes down on the floor and gestured for David to sit, her smile bright and cheerful.

‚ÄúThis is nice, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Emma said, her tone warm and inviting. ‚ÄúJust the two of us, enjoying a little break.‚Äù

David nodded, his shoulders relaxing slightly as he sat down. For a moment, it felt like they were on a date‚Äîjust Emma and him, talking and laughing like they used to. He allowed himself to enjoy the moment, the weight of the shopping trip and the awkward checkout fading into the background.

Emma picked up the menu and scanned it quickly, her eyes lighting up as she found what she wanted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have the double indulgence coffee with extra whipped cream,‚Äù she said, her tone decisive. ‚ÄúAnd maybe a few little treats to go with it. What about you, David?‚Äù

David glanced at the menu, his eyes flicking to the prices. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ just a black coffee for me,‚Äù he said, his voice quiet.

Emma nodded, her smile widening. ‚ÄúPerfect. I‚Äôll order for us.‚Äù She reached over and took David‚Äôs phone from the table. She held it up to the payment terminal, her movements smooth and practiced, and the transaction went through with a soft¬†*beep*.

David watched her, his stomach churning with unease, but he didn‚Äôt say anything. Instead, he focused on the moment, on the way Emma‚Äôs eyes sparkled as she talked about the different pastries and desserts. For a brief moment, it felt like old times‚Äîjust the two of them, enjoying each other‚Äôs company.

A few minutes later, the bartender approached their table, carrying a tray with their drinks and treats. He was tall and handsome, with a confident smile and a friendly demeanor. His eyes lingered on Emma as he set the tray down, his tone warm and inviting.

‚ÄúHere you go,‚Äù he said, his voice smooth and polished. ‚ÄúOne double indulgence coffee with extra whipped cream, a black coffee, and a few little treats to go with it.‚Äù

Emma smiled, her eyes sparkling as she looked up at him. ‚ÄúThank you so much,‚Äù she said, her tone sweet but with a hint of playfulness. ‚ÄúThis looks amazing.‚Äù

The bartender chuckled, his gaze lingering on her. ‚ÄúOnly the best for our customers. Let me know if you need anything else.‚Äù

Emma reached out, her fingers brushing lightly over his shoulder as she laughed at something he said. ‚ÄúOh, I will,‚Äù she said, her tone teasing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been so helpful already.‚Äù

David sat there, his hands wrapped around his coffee cup, watching the exchange with a mix of emotions. He wanted to feel happy for Emma, to enjoy the moment, but the way she was flirting with the bartender made his stomach churn. He glanced down at his coffee, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment, and tried to focus on the warmth of the cup in his hands.

The bartender turned to David, his smile fading slightly as he took in David‚Äôs quiet, unassuming presence. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll let you get back to your‚Ä¶ conversation,‚Äù he said, his tone polite but with a hint of condescension. He glanced at Emma, his smile returning. ‚ÄúWith this young kid.‚Äù

Emma burst out laughing, her voice bright and carefree. ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt mind him,‚Äù she said, her tone teasing. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just my housemate. But you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre much more interesting to talk to.‚Äù

The bartender chuckled, his eyes sparkling with amusement. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad I could make your visit a little more enjoyable.‚Äù

David sat there, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast, feeling like an outsider in his own life. He wanted to say something, to stand up for himself, but the weight of the situation‚Äîand the bartender‚Äôs dismissive attitude‚Äîmade it impossible to speak up.

As the bartender turned to leave, Emma asked David: ‚ÄòDo you have any cash on you?‚Äù

David hesitated, his mind racing. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ yeah,‚Äù he said, his voice quiet. He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a bill, handing it to Emma.

Emma took it without a word and quickly scribbled her phone number on the back. She handed it to the bartender, her smile widening. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúA little something extra for you. You‚Äôve been so wonderful.‚Äù

The bartender took the bill, his smile widening as he glanced at the number. ‚ÄúWell, thank you,‚Äù he said, his tone warm and inviting. He leaned in and pressed a quick kiss to Emma‚Äôs cheek, his eyes sparkling with amusement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll definitely give you a call. Name‚Äôs John btw.‚Äù

As he walked away, he passed David and gave him a firm slap on the shoulder, his tone light and teasing. ‚ÄúTake care, kid.‚Äù

David flinched, his cheeks burning with embarrassment, but he didn‚Äôt say anything. Instead, he sat there, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast, feeling like a prop in someone else‚Äôs story.

As they sipped their coffees, Emma leaned back in her chair, her eyes sparkling with amusement. She took a deep breath, her nose wrinkling slightly as she caught a lingering scent in the air. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she said, her tone casual but with a hint of playfulness, ‚ÄúJohn smells really good. Don‚Äôt you think, David?‚Äù

David hesitated, his eyes flicking to the empty space where John had been standing moments ago. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I guess so,‚Äù he said, his voice quiet.

Emma‚Äôs smile widened, and she leaned forward, her tone sharp and insistent. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚ÄòI guess so‚Äô? He smells amazing. Don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù

David shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment. ‚ÄúYeah, he‚Ä¶ he smells fine.‚Äù

Emma rolled her eyes, her tone teasing. ‚ÄúFine? David, he smells incredible. Maybe I should get some perfume while we‚Äôre here. After all, I don‚Äôt have to worry about money right now, do I?‚Äù

David‚Äôs stomach churned with unease, but he didn‚Äôt say anything. Instead, he focused on his coffee, the bitter taste a stark contrast to the sweetness of Emma‚Äôs words.

Emma tilted her head, her expression one of mock innocence. ‚ÄúSpeaking of money‚Ä¶ do you have any left in your budget for a nice perfume? Something luxurious, like what John‚Äôs wearing?‚Äù

David hesitated, his mind racing. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I have some savings, but I can‚Äôt really afford to spend much more today.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs smile faltered slightly, but she quickly recovered, her eyes lighting up with an idea. She turned and waved at John, who was behind the bar, polishing glasses. ‚ÄúJohn! Could you come here for a second?‚Äù

John looked up, his smile widening as he walked over to their table. ‚ÄúHey, Emma,‚Äù he said, his tone warm and inviting. He glanced at David, his smile fading slightly. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, kid?‚Äù

David flinched at the nickname but didn‚Äôt say anything. Emma leaned forward, her tone sweet but with a hint of mischief. ‚ÄúJohn, I was just wondering‚Ä¶ I saw a sign earlier about needing dishwashing help. Is that something David could do? Maybe on weekends?‚Äù

John raised an eyebrow, his gaze shifting to David. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ sure, I guess. We could always use an extra pair of hands. But‚Ä¶ is he any good?‚Äù

Emma laughed, her voice bright and carefree. ‚ÄúOh, David‚Äôs great at following orders. Aren‚Äôt you, David?‚Äù

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He wanted to protest, to tell Emma that he didn‚Äôt want to work here, but the look in her eyes stopped him.

Emma turned to David, her tone casual but firm. ‚ÄúWhat do you say, David? Isn‚Äôt this a great solution? You can earn some extra money, and I can get that perfume I want without worrying about your budget.‚Äù

David hesitated, his mind swirling with conflicting emotions. Finally, he nodded, his voice quiet. ‚ÄúThanks, Emma. For‚Ä¶ for thinking of this.‚Äù

John chuckled, his tone light and teasing. ‚ÄúWell, I guess we‚Äôll see how good you are, kid. Come on, let‚Äôs get you started.‚Äù

Before David could protest, John grabbed him by the shoulders and steered him toward the kitchen, his movements quick and efficient. David glanced back at Emma, but she was already standing up, David‚Äôs phone in her hand, her smile bright and carefree.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back soon,‚Äù she called over her shoulder, her tone casual. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to check out that perfume. Good luck, David!‚Äù

\--

The kitchen was small and cramped, the air filled with the clatter of dishes and the hum of the dishwasher. John led David over to the sink, his tone casual but with a hint of condescension. ‚ÄúAlright, kid. Let‚Äôs see what you‚Äôve got. Start with these.‚Äù

He gestured to a towering stack of dirty plates and glasses, his smile widening. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt break anything. We‚Äôre already short on supplies.‚Äù

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He rolled up his sleeves and got to work, his movements slow and deliberate. The water was hot, the soap stung his hands, and the weight of the situation pressed heavily on him.

As he scrubbed the dishes, his mind wandered. He thought about Emma, about the way she had manipulated him into this situation, and about the way John had dismissed him as nothing more than a ‚Äúkid.‚Äù He wanted to stand up for himself, to tell them both exactly what he thought, but the words stuck in his throat.

Two hours had passed by the time Emma returned to the coffee bar, her arms laden with three small, elegantly wrapped boxes of perfume. She walked in with a bright smile, her steps light and carefree, and made her way over to John, who was behind the bar polishing glasses.

‚ÄúHey, John,‚Äù she said, her voice cheerful. ‚ÄúHow did David do? Was he helpful?‚Äù

John glanced up, his smile widening as he saw her. ‚ÄúHey, Emma. Yeah, he did okay. He‚Äôs got a lot to learn, but he‚Äôs not terrible.‚Äù

Emma laughed, her tone playful. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs something, I guess. Thanks for giving him a chance.‚Äù

John shrugged, his tone casual. ‚ÄúNo problem. We could always use the help.‚Äù He paused, his eyes flicking to the boxes in her hands. ‚ÄúSo, how much did you end up spending?‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs smile widened, and she pulled out the receipt, handing it to him. ‚ÄúHere, take a look.‚Äù

John‚Äôs eyes widened as he scanned the total. ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ quite a bit. The two hours David worked at minimum wage definitely don‚Äôt cover this.‚Äù

David, who had been quietly wiping down the counter nearby, glanced over at the boxes of perfume. His eyes narrowed slightly as he noticed something. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ Emma,‚Äù he said, his voice quiet. ‚ÄúThere are two of the same perfumes here.‚Äù

Emma turned to him, her smile unwavering. ‚ÄúOh, I know. One‚Äôs for me, and the other is for Charlotte. I thought it would be a nice gesture‚Äîyou know, a way to show her that you care. She doesn‚Äôt think much of you right now, but maybe this will change her mind. A gift like this could earn you some respect.‚Äù

David blinked, his mind racing. He wanted to protest, to tell Emma that he hadn‚Äôt agreed to buy Charlotte a gift, but the words stuck in his throat. Before he could say anything, John chimed in, his tone light and teasing.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a really nice gesture,‚Äù John said, his smile widening. ‚ÄúGiving a woman perfume is always a classy move. She‚Äôll love it.‚Äù

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He didn‚Äôt know how to respond, so he just stood there, feeling like a prop in someone else‚Äôs story.

Emma turned to John, her tone casual but with a hint of expectation. ‚ÄúSo, how much longer does David need to work to cover the cost of the perfumes?‚Äù

John glanced at the receipt again, his expression thoughtful. ‚ÄúWell, at minimum wage‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs got about an hour and a half left.‚Äù

Emma nodded, her smile widening. ‚ÄúPerfect. I‚Äôll grab a quick bite to eat while he finishes up. When‚Äôs your break, John?‚Äù

John checked his watch, his smile returning. ‚ÄúI can take a break now. I‚Äôve got about an hour.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs eyes sparkled with amusement, and she gestured toward a nearby table. ‚ÄúGreat. Let‚Äôs sit down and chat. I‚Äôd love to hear more about this place.‚Äù

John chuckled, his tone warm and inviting. ‚ÄúSounds good to me.‚Äù He turned to David, giving him a firm slap on the back. ‚ÄúKeep up the good work, kid. And don‚Äôt forget‚Äîyou‚Äôre on serving duty too. Take their orders when they‚Äôre ready.‚Äù

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He watched as Emma and John walked over to a table, their laughter ringing out as they sat down and began chatting. The sight of them together‚Äîso carefree and happy‚Äîmade his stomach churn with a mix of jealousy and resignation.

A few minutes later, Emma waved David over, her smile bright and cheerful. ‚ÄúDavid, we‚Äôre ready to order. Two sandwiches and two drinks, please.‚Äù

David nodded, his voice quiet. ‚ÄúOkay. I‚Äôll get that for you.‚Äù

He walked over to the kitchen, his steps slow and deliberate, and placed the order. As he waited for the food to be prepared, he glanced over at Emma and John, who were deep in conversation. They looked so comfortable together, their laughter filling the air, and David couldn‚Äôt help but feel a pang of envy.

When the food was ready, David carried it over to their table, his movements careful and precise. He set the plates down in front of them, his voice quiet. ‚ÄúHere you go.‚Äù

Emma looked up, her smile widening. ‚ÄúThanks, David. You‚Äôre such a great helper.‚Äù

John chuckled, his tone light and teasing. ‚ÄúYeah, kid. You‚Äôre doing a good job.‚Äù

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He wanted to feel proud of his work, but the weight of the situation‚Äîand the lingering anxiety about his place in Emma‚Äôs life‚Äîmade it hard to relax.

David worked tirelessly in the kitchen, his hands moving quickly as he scrubbed dishes, wiped down counters, and organized supplies. The clatter of plates and the hum of the dishwasher filled the air, but David‚Äôs mind was elsewhere. He glanced over at Emma and John, who were sitting at a table near the window, laughing and chatting as they enjoyed their food and drinks.

Emma looked radiant, her smile bright and carefree, and John seemed completely at ease, his charm and confidence on full display. David couldn‚Äôt help but feel a pang of jealousy as he watched them together, but he pushed the feeling down and focused on his work.

After about an hour, John walked into the kitchen, his smile widening as he saw David. ‚ÄúHey, kid,‚Äù he said, his tone casual but with a hint of condescension. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù

David nodded, his voice quiet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going okay. I‚Äôm almost done with the dishes.‚Äù

John chuckled, his tone light and teasing. ‚ÄúGood. But don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre off the hook yet. There‚Äôs still a lot to do.‚Äù

David‚Äôs heart sank, but he didn‚Äôt argue. Instead, he followed John‚Äôs instructions, his movements slow and deliberate as he tackled the new tasks. John was relentless, assigning David more work and watching him closely, his tone sharp and controlling.

‚ÄúMake sure you clean that thoroughly,‚Äù John said, his tone firm as he pointed to a particularly dirty pot. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget to wipe down the counters. We can‚Äôt have any messes here.‚Äù

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He worked twice as hard, his hands moving quickly as he tried to keep up with John‚Äôs demands. Meanwhile, John leaned against the counter, his arms crossed and his expression relaxed, as if he didn‚Äôt have a care in the world.

After another half hour, David finally finished his tasks, his body aching and his stomach growling with hunger. He walked over to Emma, his steps slow and deliberate, and cleared his throat. ‚ÄúEmma, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm done with the work. Can I grab something to eat now?‚Äù

Emma looked up, her smile widening as she saw him. ‚ÄúOh, David, you‚Äôre such a hard worker. Here, have this.‚Äù She handed him a small cookie that had come with her coffee, her tone casual but with a hint of expectation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôll tide you over until we‚Äôre done shopping.‚Äù

David hesitated, his stomach growling loudly, but he took the cookie, his voice quiet. ‚ÄúThanks, Emma.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs smile widened, and she stood up, her tone bright and cheerful. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go. We‚Äôve got more shopping to do, and I don‚Äôt want to waste any more time.‚Äù

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He ate the cookie quickly, the small treat doing little to satisfy his hunger, and followed Emma out of the coffee bar, the weight of the shopping bags pulling at his arms.

David followed Emma into the lingerie store, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment as they stepped inside. The store was brightly lit, with rows of delicate fabrics and intricate designs on display. David felt out of place, his discomfort evident as he glanced around nervously.

Emma, on the other hand, seemed completely at ease. She walked through the aisles with confidence, her eyes scanning the racks for something that caught her eye. She picked up a few items‚Äîlace bras, silk panties, and a matching set‚Äîand held them up for David to see.

‚ÄúWhat do you think of this one?‚Äù she asked, her tone playful as she held up a black lace set.

David‚Äôs cheeks burned, and he glanced away, his voice quiet. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs nice.‚Äù

Emma laughed, her voice bright and carefree. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so shy, David. Come on, let‚Äôs go try these on.‚Äù

Before David could protest, Emma grabbed his hand and pulled him toward the fitting rooms. The attendant gave them a curious look but didn‚Äôt say anything as Emma led David into one of the small, curtained rooms.

Inside the fitting room, David stood awkwardly, his hands clenched at his sides as Emma began to undress. She pulled off her sweater, revealing a simple bra underneath, and David‚Äôs eyes widened in shock. He turned away quickly, his cheeks burning.

‚ÄúEmma, I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think this is a good idea,‚Äù he stammered, his voice trembling.

Emma laughed, her tone teasing. ‚ÄúOh, relax, David. Just close your eyes and turn around. I‚Äôll let you know when it‚Äôs safe to look.‚Äù

David hesitated, but he did as she asked, turning his back to her and closing his eyes tightly. He could hear the rustle of fabric as Emma changed into the new lingerie, and his heart pounded in his chest.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Emma said after a moment, her voice bright and cheerful. ‚ÄúYou can look now.‚Äù

David turned around slowly, his eyes widening as he saw Emma standing there in the black lace set. The delicate fabric hugged her curves perfectly, and David felt a rush of heat flood his cheeks. He swallowed hard, his voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ it looks really nice.‚Äù

Emma smiled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. ‚ÄúI think so too. Here, look at the price tag.‚Äù She held up the tag, her tone casual but with a hint of expectation. ‚ÄúDo you think you can spare a little more from your savings? I‚Äôd really love to have this.‚Äù

David hesitated, his mind racing. He had been saving up for a new PlayStation, something he had been looking forward to for months. But the way Emma looked at him‚Äîher eyes hopeful, her smile warm‚Äîmade it impossible to say no.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I guess so,‚Äù he said finally, his voice quiet.

Emma‚Äôs smile widened, and she stepped closer, wrapping her arms around him in a tight hug. ‚ÄúThank you, David. You‚Äôre the best.‚Äù She pressed a quick kiss to his cheek before pulling back, her tone casual. ‚ÄúOh, and just so you know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm planning to wear this on my first date with John. Isn‚Äôt that exciting?‚Äù

David‚Äôs heart sank, but he didn‚Äôt say anything. Instead, he nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast.

As Emma turned to change back into her clothes, David felt a rush of heat flood his body. He tried to push down the feelings bubbling inside him, but it was no use. When Emma turned back to him, her eyes flicked downward, and she let out a soft laugh.

‚ÄúOh, David,‚Äù she said, her tone teasing. ‚ÄúIs that because of me?‚Äù

David‚Äôs cheeks burned, and he glanced away, his voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I guess so.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs smile widened, and she stepped closer, her tone playful. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm flattered, but we can‚Äôt have this ‚Ä¶little ‚Äòproblem‚Äô. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll figure something out.‚Äù

David nodded silently, his mind swirling with unspoken thoughts. He wanted to feel happy for Emma, to share in her excitement, but the weight of the situation‚Äîand the lingering anxiety about his place in her life‚Äîmade it hard to relax.

When they left the fitting room, Emma walked over to the checkout counter, her smile bright and cheerful. She handed the lingerie set to the cashier and pulled out David‚Äôs phone, unlocking it with a quick scan of his face. The payment went through with a soft¬†*beep*, and Emma turned to David, her tone casual.

‚ÄúThanks again, David. You‚Äôre such a good friend.‚Äù

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He wanted to feel proud of his generosity, but the weight of the situation‚Äîand the lingering anxiety about his savings‚Äîmade it hard to relax.

As they walked toward the car, the shopping bags heavy in David‚Äôs hands, Emma began chatting casually, her tone light and carefree. ‚ÄúOh, by the way,‚Äù she said, her voice bright, ‚Äúyour friends are going to the movies tomorrow. Did you know?‚Äù

David blinked, his steps faltering slightly. ‚ÄúWhat? No, I didn‚Äôt. How do you know?‚Äù

Emma smiled, her tone teasing. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a WhatsApp group. They asked if you were coming, and I answered for you.‚Äù

David‚Äôs eyes widened, and he instinctively reached for his phone, only to remember that Emma still had it. ‚ÄúWait, you‚Ä¶ you have my phone.‚Äù

Emma laughed, her voice light and airy. ‚ÄúOh, right. Here you go.‚Äù She handed him his phone, her smile unwavering.

David quickly unlocked it and opened the WhatsApp group, scanning the messages. His friends had indeed invited him, and Emma had replied on his behalf:¬†*‚ÄúSorry, I can‚Äôt make it. I‚Äôm busy.‚Äù*

David frowned, his frustration bubbling to the surface. ‚ÄúEmma, I¬†*can*¬†go tomorrow. I‚Äôm not busy.‚Äù

Emma stopped walking and turned to him, her expression one of mild surprise. ‚ÄúDavid, you¬†*are*¬†busy. You have a whole day of schoolwork to catch up on. Remember? You missed a lot.‚Äù

David shook his head, his voice firm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make time. I‚Äôll work tonight and get most of it done. I can still go to the movies tomorrow.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs smile widened, and she clapped her hands together, her tone bright and cheerful. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fantastic news! I‚Äôm so proud of you for being responsible.‚Äù

David felt a flicker of hope, but it was quickly extinguished as Emma continued. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to work tonight and all day tomorrow, then you‚Äôll have the evening free. Perfect! You can help John at the bar. I‚Äôll let him know right now.‚Äù

David‚Äôs heart sank, and he opened his mouth to protest, but Emma cut him off with a wave of her hand. ‚ÄúDavid, from now on, your free time comes last. If John needs you, that‚Äôs your priority. You can‚Äôt have free time if you‚Äôre not free, right?‚Äù She laughed, her tone light and teasing.

David stared at her, his mind swirling with a mix of emotions‚Äîfrustration, resentment, and a deep, aching sense of helplessness. He wanted to argue, to tell her that he deserved some time for himself, but the look in her eyes‚Äîbright and carefree‚Äîmade it impossible to say no.

Emma‚Äôs smile widened, and she gestured to the shopping bags in his hands. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget‚Ä¶ all the extra money you earn goes straight to this.‚Äù She pointed to the bags of clothes and the boxes of perfume, her tone casual but with a hint of expectation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing such a great job, David. I‚Äôm really proud of you.‚Äù",1,1742507131.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Kendu is a memecoin that is on 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE, Kendu is focused on organic, non KOL, growth. We are entirely community led, focusing on both social media and IRL events/products. Kendu has completely captured social media, I am sure you would heard about Kendu or at least seen our name somewhere. We have around 18k holders and this is growing even in this market. Kendu ATH Market Cap was 283 million, back in June 2024, which is around a 30x from this value. Since then Kendu has went through some painful redistributions, which all coins will need to go through at some point. However, when ETH wakes up, we are pretty confident Kendu is guaranteed to reach ATH. In my opinion(not financial advice), buying Kendu at this price removes all risk from the investment. In the community, we are planning to have multiple more chill VCs in the telegram, which I welcome everyone to join, whether you are a holder or not.

Josh is also gonna start some X(Twitter) spaces on the main Kendu account, which I advise everyone to join, to get a taste of Kendu. In addition, any holders should also join this.

The group are giving out lots of Kendu Energy(yes we have energy drinks, more will be mentioned later in the post), they have created a Kendu Energy cocktail menu and are giving out merch. These are certified Kendu Legends!!! Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.

**A Few Interesting Idea**

Shib, Doge and Pepe have shown what sort of potential organic memecoins have, it shows that there is no ceiling for growth. The fact that Shib went from 22 million market cap to 22 billion in 36 days. Yes you read that right..... 36 days. Kendu has been recognised by mutliple crypto OGs. These people all see the potential in Kendu, we are creating a recipe to take over both IRL and social media. Kendu is the Shib 2021 opportunity, all the signs are there, Shib was at a similar MC at this point in the cycle(this cycle seems to be more delayed compared to 2021). Kendu is focused on running it up the same way the other MemeCoin Hall of Famers have done in the past. Kendu is unstoppable and we continue working in this market!!!

In terms of social media presence, Kendu has the potential to take over levels peak Shiba Inu had reached in 2021.  
Kendu can easily 1453x this year at the time of writing this post. In my opinion we can 3000x but I am a dreamer lol.

I advise you to join our telegram or our subreddit, but our tg is far busier. Even if you don't hold a bag join us and check us out. Ask any questions you want, we are a very welcoming community : )  
Skip the Papa Johns and put the money into Kendu $15 can easily become $15000.

It is your choice Anon, this is your opportunity to join a community destined to cement it's legacy in crypto history. Join the winning team, we are $KENDU.

We Don't Gamble, We Work!!!

1jg0hv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jg0hv2/complex_and_my_gp_is_stumped/,Complex and my GP is stumped,"I‚Äôm looking for guidance on what to discuss with my doctor regarding my ongoing health issues. I have a complex medical history and suspect something like Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) could be involved. I‚Äôd appreciate insight into what tests or conditions I should ask about based on my symptoms.

My details 
F/47yrs
187 pounds
5‚Äù2

In childhood, I suffered eczema from hockey equipment, difficulty breathing, and full face flushing with any activity. I got chronic headaches at the age of nine and through elimination diet determined that caffeine was causing my problem from soda pop consumption regularly.

I had three high dander animals growing up: German Shepherd, tabby, cat, and rabbit. I noticed then that my reactions were different than my family with bloodshot eyes, swelling eyelids, water retention in the eye area, difficulty breathing and itchy body.

I was diagnosed as being asthmatic because of the breathing issues that were exasperated when I played hockey with the cold air. I used both fast acting and steroid inhalers up until about the age of 26 to manage my breathing concerns, which at times I was required to take home and do nebulizing treatments.

I have been bullied my entire youth because my palms were sweaty and excess armpit sweat. 

I had tubes put in my ears twice -once at four and once at seven years of age due to chronic ear infections.

When I was 16, 17 and 18, I probably had 30 instances where the doctors advised me that I had tonsilitis strep throat or a sinus infection. Yes I still had high dander animals in the home. I became antibiotic resistant at 17 to all treatments for the above diagnosis‚Äôs.

Moved out at 18 and realize that the animals were contributing to my breathing difficulties. 

At 19 had an anaphylactic response to cherry whiskey, which I had been drinking for a year as my sole go to drink when I did have an alcoholic beverage. I come from a family of alcoholics and I know I was not consuming enough alcohol at the time on a regular basis to be considered an alcoholic. Neither have I had problems with alcohol as far as alcoholism as an adult. I had one strong drink before going to the bar, and my mouth and nose area turned bright pink and my throat began to close. I was hospitalized treated and released that night for an anaphylactic reaction.

Then I noticed the exact same above pink area and throat closing symptoms with a variety of things related to sulfites, including red and blush wine and some prepackaged teriyaki or honey garlic sauces. I simply avoided animals and avoided sauces that hadn‚Äôt been made from scratch and eliminated any alcohol that would cause this reaction and did fine for my entire 20s and 30s. 

Now to bounce back to when I was 16 years old I was in a very bad car accident with a lap belt on and as a result of that collision on November 25, I had 6 inches resected from my small intestine on February 9 because of scar tissue closing off that section of my intestine as well as Some cauterization to ensure that the residual scar tissue that existed would not spread.

I managed my hyperhidrosis my entire life after being diagnosed with it at the age of 10  by a doctor - developing coping mechanisms to hide my sweat or just avoid activities.

Sometime in my early 30s Botox became a thing that it could potentially help with my excessive sweating and I responded well initially to the first five or six treatments then they became too expensive. I had another three Botox rounds in my armpits where each armpit would get a full vile at ages 40 to 43 - the Botox still worked, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt as effective as when I was younger and took more regular doses of it because we had two insurance plans at the time. 

I had an allergy test done at 20 that showed nothing except reactions to animals and mould. 

I had another allergy test done at 36 again to find out that I was only allergic to animals and mould and I can‚Äôt remember which pollen from trees. 

Yesterday I saw an immunologist and had a full allergy test done to show no sensitivity to anything. He was very concerned and asked why I was even there like I had wasted his time.

After passionately, speaking to him about my health concerns, he has recommended that I need to seek a disease specialist. I don‚Äôt argue because my quality of life continues to deteriorate.

Now I have become a woman over 40 and I am experiencing hormonal things that I think maybe exasperating my conditions and concerns.

I have had two full sets of blood work in the last two years to find out that my blood is showing absolutely nothing is out of range.

Why I think it could be MCAS? It‚Äôs in my daily symptoms that I live with.

In January 3 2023 I received a third vaccination for the C word. In January I had a bivalent dose and instantly my entire body was itchy and I itched for 27 days for 24 hours a day and only after 27 days did I start to notice that the chronic itching Had diminished to maybe 18 hours in a day instead of 24 hours a day. 

February 17 was the first day I could recall not being itchy all day. February 28 of 2023. I felt like I had completely come out of whatever reaction I had to the bivalent vaccine.

The first week was absolute hell after I had the vaccine. I was itchy, uncomfortable, and irritable. I would wake in the middle of the night, wanting to peel my skin off because my entire body would be so itchy. It would wake me up.

The other thing I noticed was now I had full body itching, oral reactions inside my mouth that felt like I ate a Costco size bag of Miss Vicky‚Äòs salt and vinegar chips in about an hour sitting‚Ä¶ so my mouth felt like it had 1 million little paper cuts, stinging with vinegar in them. That is how I reacted to apples on January 18.

January 20 I made shrimp Alfredo for the family and eventually figured out that the shrimp is what caused me to have 48 hours of full body itching, water retained in my eyelids to the point where it caused difficulty blinking, and I lost some of my field of vision until the excessive water was re-absorbed by my body and swollen tongue. 

I started working with a natural path in October 2023 where we worked on my gut health and she could see that my body was extremely inflamed yet my blood work showed I was just fine. 

We worked on gut health because I have never had regular formed bowel movements ever since my car accident or potentially as a result of me becoming antibiotic resistant as they both happened between 16 and 19 years of age. So gut health became a priority as well as an elimination diet. I did a full anti-inflammatory only diet except for maintaining one cup of coffee a day for two months.

Then, as I added in food, I found out that gluten even very small amounts (I am sensitive to cross contamination - deep fryers, but the deep fryer oil has to be dirty. Otherwise if it‚Äôs fresh oil, I can eat McDonald‚Äôs french fries for example, without having a reaction). I have pretty much eliminated all fruit and most vegetables from my diet since then and this is true today. 

You might be asking what do my reactions to gluten look like? Itching and it can be localized if I do a food test in my mouth where I gently put something in my inner lip and hold it in my mouth to see if I have a reaction, but if I actually ingest it, then it is full body, and when I was at a restaurant, I could feel that I had been gluten-ized or triggered because I could literally feel my mouth the back of my throat down into my oesophagus and into my stomach, become itchy and irritated and uncomfortable. 

Now remember, I just saw an immunologist. I have no allergies.

Sometimes I get the Miss Vicky Chip reaction and it only happens in my mouth where I feel like I have 1000 paper cuts  

Every single day no matter the season I walk out my door and my eyes water and my nose waters and it‚Äôs been that way for as long as I can remember, but I‚Äôve never really thought about it until the immunologist asked me this specifically yesterday so I think it‚Äôs valuable here  

The other thing that has plagued me since I got the vaccination - my hyperhidrosis overnight became worse than it had ever been. I sweat sitting at rest, and when I sweat it almost feels like a fever comes over me, and I sweat profusely to the point where my clothing will hold the moisture then I go into a cold sweat where I can shiver and convulse if I don‚Äôt have external supports such as new clothing, a shower to help regulate my body temperature or a heated blanket to bring me back from the cold. 

The final thing that causes me great distress is the daily swelling I experience. I am married and I cannot wear my wedding ring because my finger at 10 AM is too swollen to keep the ring on. I have almost had to go to the hospital to have my ring surgically removed and have hurt my finger trying to get it off when I miss that 10 AM window to remove it.

When I sit down in a chair, I can look straight down at my breasts in the morning and not see my tummy. Every single day before the end of the day I can sit in that exact same chair in that exact same position and when I look down, I can see my stomach sticking out past my breasts.

This is highly alarming to me because I can no longer wear jeans or fitted dress pants that do not have stretch in them and I am a professional and wearing yoga pants - Every single day is just not OK.

I was also stalked and criminally harassed for seven years before police finally intervened because my stalker had conspired to kill me and went up on charges. I left the house where my stalker knew I lived and lost my new house in a house fired nine months later. As a result of the criminal harassment and 83 reports to the police and nothing done and knowing that I was being followed, but not understanding why (I was stalked by my best friend who was a female, and it didn‚Äôt make sense that she would be the one behind this until charges were late against her). I was diagnosed with complex PTSD at 38 years of age. So yeah, my cortisol levels have been elevated for a significant period of time and I am happy to say that thousands of dollars of therapy later and multiple modalities of therapy. I no longer suffer with my mental health. 

Current medication‚Äôs and past medication‚Äôs

The only medication that I reliably take my entire life was birth control. I did have prolonged steroid and fast acting inhalers as noted above. And antibiotics as indicated above. 

Otherwise, I am generally on nothing unless I knew I was going to my brother‚Äòs house where he has a St. Bernard, which is the absolute worst dog reaction I have ever had. I reacted to the dog saliva and the dander. The only way I could stay the entire weekend at my brothers house so two nights was to take a reactant in the morning then I would take a Benadryl at lunch and then I would take Allegra before I went to bed. If I did that triple dose, and dosed myself a couple days before I went to his house I would not be hell on earth burning itching skin the entire time I was there, and I could actually function and enjoy family.

After going through almost 2 years of therapy with my natural path, I still continue to take vitamin D, Vitamin B, and quectine with bromolaine. I recently ran out of probiotics, but I‚Äôve been taking a female specific one recommended by my naturopathic doctor. More recently, I have been experimenting with adding Pepcid when my tummy is sore or cramping when I have eaten food and it seems to help with the cramps and the next days bowel movement. 

As I continue to see a decline in my life, I don‚Äôt wanna go outside. I feel like I‚Äôm being attacked by the air. I‚Äôm sensitive. I‚Äôm prickly. I can‚Äôt mow my lawn anymore because of the vibrations of my lawnmower. My legs brush against grass or the flowers in my flower bed and they sting initially, which goes away in about 5-10 minutes and then I am itchy for about four hours afterwards, just from general contact.

I am terrified. I am going to become a bubble girl who cannot exist outside of a very sterile environment.

I have stopped all use of anti-aging creams and now use a barrier cream after being diagnosed with Perioral dermatitis cause by steroids (I had a round of a nasty bug and it caused breathing difficulties similar to my childhood asthma and I used a steroid inhaler and a famous TikTok antiaging cream that contains steroid ingredients for brightening). I stopped both products suddenly and I believe that is what ultimately led to me getting a dermatitis diagnosis, but in my heart, I strongly and fervently believe that it was steroid use withdraw and I was misdiagnosed.

Key Health Concerns:
	‚Ä¢	Excessive sweating (primary and secondary hyperhidrosis) ‚Äì Worst at night, with a surge in the morning.
	‚Ä¢	Daily angioedema & worsening reactions ‚Äì My body reacts as if allergic, but I do not have true allergies. This worsened significantly after an immediate reaction to the Pfizer bivalent COVID vaccine in 2023. 
	‚Ä¢	Irregular periods (lifelong issue) ‚Äì Recently, I had a one-day spotting period followed by intense nighttime hot flashes about nine days later.
	‚Ä¢	Chronic high cortisol ‚Äì Daily struggles despite normal bloodwork.
	‚Ä¢	Digestive issues ‚Äì History of loose stools, which improved with gut support, but worsened after starting L-glutathione.
	‚Ä¢	Other symptoms ‚Äì Brain fog, heat intolerance, sensitivity to environmental triggers, unexplained swelling, and fatigue.

Relevant Medical History:
	‚Ä¢	Major surgery at 16 (small intestine obstruction due to scar tissue).
	‚Ä¢	Frequent infections in childhood and adolescence (tonsillitis, strep, bronchitis, pneumonia).
	‚Ä¢	Longstanding reactivity to environmental and food triggers (without confirmed allergies).
	‚Ä¢	Struggles with weight and metabolism ‚Äì Despite perfect bloodwork, I feel physically unwell daily.

I want to go into my doctor‚Äôs appointment prepared with specific tests or conditions to ask about. What should I request in terms of diagnostics (e.g., blood tests, mast cell markers, hormone panels)? Are there other possible explanations for my symptoms that I haven‚Äôt considered?

I am a 56 y/o male with a likely four-year history of diverticulitis.¬† I say likely, because my episodes were misdiagnosed as IBS for more than three years.¬† The pain was miserable, and the cramps left me feeling as though my abdomen would rupture.¬† I went to a GI doctor who seemed dismissive and suggested that I was stressed and had IBS.¬† He pulled my man card by adding that women primarily get IBS like this.¬† He told me to relax and consume more fiber.¬† I felt emasculated and continued to power through the attacks that brought me to my knees.¬† I later went back to the GI office to suggest that it was likely something else due to the severity of the pain.¬† His medical assistant smirked and asked me, ‚ÄúHow are your cramps?‚Äù¬† I remember feeling as though she was treating me like a whiny male.¬† The doctor told me again to relax and prescribed dicyclomine.¬† Dicyclomine did nothing.¬† For three years I experienced this terrible pain and assumed it was IBS.¬† When the episodes occurred, I drank Metamucil as suggested.¬† Paradoxically, more fiber seemed to make the pain worse.¬† Go figure.¬† I downloaded a gut directed hypnosis app for IBS and developed an incredible tolerance for pain.¬† I had approximately ten episodes like this prior to 7/2024.

My stomach started acting up again in June 2024.¬† I powered through like so many times before.¬† I didn‚Äôt say anything to my wife until the night of 6/30/24.¬† The pain was typical, but this time I had uncontrollable chills.¬† My sleepless night was interrupted by many trips to the toilet to squirt lava into the bowl.¬† At about 7am on 7/1/24 I thought to myself, ‚ÄúI feel like crap and it‚Äôs going to take lots of coffee to make it through my twelve hours at work.‚Äù¬† I then recall thinking, ‚Äúuh -oh.‚Äù¬† The next thing I remember is hearing my wife on the phone talking to someone about me.¬† I was on the floor bleeding from my ass and head.¬† When the paramedics got there my BP was 50/30 and they couldn‚Äôt get blood for a finger stick.¬† I heard my dead mother ask me what happened.¬† Off to the hospital I went with a panicky ambo crew.

There was a flurry of activity at the hospital.¬† I gashed my forehead to my skull when I collapsed at home.¬† I remember lots of chatter in the ER and I eventually started to come around more.¬† I told them when I was coming back from the CT that I was going out again.¬† I crashed again, but my BP was better at 72/38.¬† They got a room ready for me as they stitched up my head.¬† I eventually learned that I had diverticulitis with a phlegmon that inflamed and thickened everything in that abdominal neighborhood.¬† The backdoor bleeding was from a perforation that triggered sepsis.¬† Hold my calls.¬† I‚Äôll be in the hospital for a while.

Nothing has been the same since that time.¬† I have a new GI doctor who suggests that years of misdiagnosis wrecked me.¬† I‚Äôve consistently had the familiar pain, nausea, and awfulness that we all know.¬† I‚Äôve had enough antibiotics to disrupt the flora of my city‚Äôs sewer system.¬† More scans and a colonoscopy for good measure.¬† My tortuous colon is filled with diverticula and concentric bowel wall thickening.¬† My new GI doctor added SCAD to my list of GI problems.¬† I had another episode before Christmas.¬† I drove myself to the ER after work one day and the CT found diverticulitis with free fluid and all the markers of another round of misery.¬† I have some degree of LLQ pain every day.¬† I‚Äôve fought the good fight with diet and medications, but my doctor suggested a surgical consultation.¬† I am almost certain that they‚Äôll suggest surgery and they'll probably be right.¬† However, something inside of me still suggests that I am being dramatic and that I should just deal with it.¬† I think that I am writing this to help me wrap my head around this whole experience.¬† Thoughts?¬† Is surgery the way to go?¬† This group and AI have been more helpful to me than any doctor I‚Äôve had.¬† Thanks in advance.",1,1742506803.0,Diverticulitis,1,1.0,False

1jg0bzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelideas/comments/1jg0bzn/looking_for_title_and_link/,Looking for title and link,"I tracked my husband Cole and found out that he went to his assistant Elsa 's house.
Elsa's baby bump is unmistakable.
Everything felt like it was moving in slow motion as she wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him down into a smooch.
 It was too much. It was suffocating. 
Cole was cheating on me.With Elsa.And she was pregnant.
""Stay cool, Sara. You're stronger than you think. You can get through this.""
I straightened my posture and wiped the tears from my face, a sudden surge of determination rising within me.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

""Do you know where Elsa is?"" I asked my assistant Dona. She shook her head.
""I've been looking for her all morning."" I glanced at Elsa's desk. ""But she was here, right?""
""Yes,"" Dona said. ""I saw her come in, but then she took the elevator‚Äîprobably heading to the lobby to grab something to eat.""
""Yeah, that sounds like her. The baby probably demanded to be fed,"" I chuckled. ""Let me know as soon as you see her, okay?""
""Sure thing, boss."" Dona gave me a playful salute.
I glanced at my watch‚Äî9.40 a.m. Our office started at 9. What had Elsa been doing in the lobby for that long? Frowning, I turned and headed back to my office.
Seated behind my desk, I opened my email. Thirty unread messages stared back at me, and for a moment, a wave of overwhelm washed over me. This was exactly why I needed Elsa‚Äîat least a third of these fell under her responsibilities. As my finance manager, she was the one who handled expenses and invoicing. She was supposed to help me sort through this mess.
I had no idea how I was going to manage when Elsa took her twelve-weeks maternity leave. My interior design firm was small‚Äîa subsidiary of Cole's real estate development company‚Äîwith only a handful of employees. Losing my finance manager for that long felt like a looming crisis.
Sighing, I started reading the first email.
Everything had been going smoothly‚Äîuntil I reached the eleventh email. That's when I hit a problem I couldn't solve on my own. Glancing at the clock on my laptop, I saw it was already 10:15 a.m.
And Elsa still hadn't come back.
Or had she returned to her desk, and Dona just forgot to tell me?
I got up from my seat and stepped out of my office, my eyes immediately landing on Elsa's empty desk. Still not here.
I turned my attention to Dona, who was deeply engrossed in her typing, her pink headset on, unaware of my presence. I tapped her shoulder gently. She looked up at me, lowering the headset.
""Is Elsa coming back yet?"" I asked.
Dona shook her head. ""I haven't seen her. If she did, I surely have noticed.""
Yeah. Of course. Elsa needed to pass by Dona's desk to get to hers.
""Try to call her, please.""
""I did."" Dona said. ""She didn't pick up.""
""Try calling the security downstairs. I worried something happened to her. She's about to have the baby soon.""
""I saw Elsa heading to the second elevator row,"" Angie, another team member, suddenly said as she arrived at her desk across from Dona. She must have just returned from a meeting.
""Probably going to your husband for some budget approval.""
I frowned. I hadn't asked Elsa to do anything like that. Why would she go there?
Angie glanced at me, a knowing smirk tugging at her lips, which made me suspicious. ""You didn't send her?""
""No,"" I said, shaking my head. A strange feeling crept into my chest. Why would she go to Cole?
Dona, who had been silent until now, looked up from her laptop. ""Maybe she took the initiative? Or maybe she needed some advice?""
""Still, she should've run it by me first,"" I muttered, reaching for my phone. My fingers hovered over the screen, debating whether to text Elsa. I turned to Dona. ""I'll be in my office. Let me know if she comes back.""
Dona nodded.
As soon as the door to my office closed, I called Cole. He didn't pick up. I tried again. After the third ring, he finally answered.
""Hi, babe,"" his voice came through the speaker, warm but distracted.
""Honey, I'm looking for Elsa. Is she there?""
A brief pause. ""She was here this morning, but she already left.""
I frowned. ""Why did she come to see you?"" I couldn't quite hide the suspicion in my tone.
Elsa was technically an employee of the parent company, not mine, which meant she reported to Cole. But she had been assigned to assist me in monitoring finances. If she had something to report, the professional courtesy would have been to consult me first.
Cole sighed. ""She wanted to go over some numbers before submitting them. She said it was urgent.""
I clenched my jaw. ""And you didn't ask if I already gone through them?""
Another pause. Then a sigh. ""I told her I'd review them first. We can review them together if you want.""
That didn't make me feel any better. ""But she didn't say anything to me."" I said. ""Which numbers did she talked about?""
Cole didn't answer me. ""Cole?""
""The Jamison project."" He finally answered. ""Babe, sorry, I'm a bit distracted. I'I have an urgent email I need to send. I'll talk to you tonight, okay?""
""Okay,"" I replied slowly. ""Love you,""
""Love you too.""
He closed the call.
I returned to my emails, forcing myself to focus on the reports and requests piling up in my inbox. But the nagging feeling in my chest refused to fade, a persistent distraction that made concentration impossible. My eyes skimmed over the words on the screen, but my mind kept circling back to Elsa.
Why would she go to Cole for something without discussing it with me first? It felt like she didn't trust me. This was my husband's company, for God's sake‚ÄîI could just ask him in bed tonight.
I needed answers. I dialed Cole's number again.
No answer.
Frustrated, I pushed back from my desk and walked out of my office. ""I'm stepping out for a bit,"" I called to Dona as I headed for the elevator. ""Be back after lunch.""
SARA
It might have been my imagination, but everyone was acting strangely.
Lawrence, Cole's PA, stared at me with wide eyes and an open mouth, as if bracing for impact. I glanced at my right‚ÄîMaisie, Cole's secretary, was also staring. Both of them had risen from their seats to greet me, something they had never done before. Ever.
I didn't come to Cole's office often, but I had been here enough to know that something was definitely off with them.
""Uh... what?"" I had to ask. This was getting weird.
Lawrence and Maisie exchanged a quick, uneasy glance before snapping their attention back to me.
They shook their heads.
I shrugged, then continued my walk.
""Cole's in a meeting,"" Lawrence said abruptly. ""An overseas conference call. It might take a while.""
""Oookay..."" I trailed off, coming to a stop, my gaze drifting to the chair across from Lawrence's desk. ""Then I'll just wait here.""
Maisie shifted uncomfortably, casting a quick glance at Lawrence before returning her gaze to me. ""I think it's okay if you go in,"" she said, her voice slightly shaky. ""It's an important meeting, but you're his wife, so...""
She trailed off as she and Lawrence exchanged another uneasy glance.
""But it could take hours,"" Lawrence added, a little too quickly.
I narrowed my eyes. ""And?""
Maisie forced a smile. ""Lawrence probably just doesn't want you to waste your time.""
I crossed my arms. ""I don't mind."" Pulling out the chair across from Lawrence's desk, I sat down, making it clear I wasn't going anywhere. ""I can wait here.""
Lawrence exhaled slowly, his fingers twitching against the desk. Maisie looked like she wanted to say something but pressed her lips together instead.
Something was definitely off.
I frowned, my gaze bouncing between the two of them. ""Okay, what is going on?""
Maisie hesitated, staring at me for a long moment before finally sighing. ""Just go in, Sara. It'll be fine.""
Lawrence shot her a sharp glare, but she didn't acknowledge it.
My eyes stayed on Maisie, trying to decipher the strange, almost resigned expression on her face. Seriously. What's going on?
Slowly, I rose from my seat and walked toward the door, hyper-aware of their eyes tracking my every move.
My fingers curled around the handle, and for a split second, I hesitated. Then, I pushed the door open.
Cole stood by the floor-to-ceiling window behind his desk, one hand in his pocket, the other holding his phone. His suit jacket was draped over the back of his chair. At the sound of the door, he turned. His face was calm, composed‚Äîbut there was something in his eyes that made me pause.
But I wasn't sure what. Maybe it was just in my head.
I pushed the thought aside and shut the door behind me. ""Hey,"" I said.
""Hi babe,"" Cole offered me a soft smile.
I glanced around the room‚Äîempty. Just the two of us. ""I thought you were on an important call.""
""I was,"" he said, swallowing. ""It's done already.""
""Lawrence said it might take hours,"" I pressed.
""We solved the problem quicker than I anticipated.""
""Oh, good."" I walked closer, and he stepped around his desk, pulling me into his chest before pressing a smooch to my cheek.
""What brings you here?"" he asked.
""I want to talk about Elsa.""
His dark blue eyes flickered‚Äîconfusion, maybe. ""Elsa?""
""Yeah. I'm not comfortable with her coming to you behind my back. The Jamison project isn't that important to seek advice directly from you.""
""It's not?"" His eyes widened slightly.
""It's just a small renovation. Why did she bother you with it?"" And it was not that urgent.
Cole let me go, stepping back toward his desk before sinking into his chair. ""I don't know, Sara. She probably needed advice.""
I walked over and took a seat across from him, my eyes locked on him. ""What kind of advice?""
""I didn't have the time, so I asked her to just email me.""
My eyes narrowed. ""She didn't even tell you anything about the project?""
Cole shook his head.
That wasn't like Cole. He was meticulous, pushy, and a complete control freak. He never left things to chance‚Äîhe would want to know every detail. Anyone on his team would spend hours preparing and gathering information before approaching him. Elsa would need to prepare a lot, and she would need to go through me, before going to Cole. So, for Elsa to suddenly go to him one morning, and for him not to bother asking anything, was unusual.
I remember him saying on the phone ""She wanted to go over some numbers before submitting them. She said it was urgent.""
It was even more unusual for him to review preliminary numbers before they were finalized. Cole only wanted to see the final figures. No one dared to submit a draft.
I decided to test him. ""What do you think about the budget we proposed?""
""I told you, I didn't have time to go through it,"" he said, his voice tight.
Still not giving me an answer. Which I didn't understand. Why was he acting like this?
Did Elsa complain about me? To my own husband? Had I made a mistake in my plan?
I kept pressing. ""But surely, she showed you something if she came all the way here,"" I said, then added, ""Without even telling me.""
Cole was studying me. ""Why does it bother you so much, Sara?""
""Because,"" I sighed, feeling a twinge of doubt. Maybe I was being ridiculous. ""It feels like she doesn't trust me. She went straight to you without consulting me. I can't work with someone like that, and I don't have the time to focus solely on developing her.""
I glanced at Cole and found his gaze had softened‚Äîalmost sad, in fact.
It felt like he was feeling sorry for me‚Äîlike he thought I lacked the leadership ability to develop my own team.
""She was part of your team before,"" I continued. ""She's used to the fast, structured, and efficient workflow at the parent company‚ÄîI get that. But my team operates differently. We're smaller, we move at a different pace, and while we may not be as rigidly efficient, we complete our projects with precision and care.""
""You're her boss, Sara. You tell her how you want it to work.""
""Oh, I will tell her,"" I scoffed. ""But I just can't find her. She's missing the entire morning.""
Cole didn't respond, his gaze was still tight and locked onto me.
""Cole."" I leaned forward across his desk, lowering my voice. ""I'm not happy working with her. She's stubborn and uncooperative. My team has complained about her, too. I've given it three months, and nothing has changed.""
Still, he said nothing.
I exhaled, leaning back. ""She's going on maternity leave soon, and I can't run things without a finance manager. This is the perfect time to find a replacement. When she returns, she can work for you again.""
""Okay,"" Cole responded.
""Okay?"" I repeated, couldn't quite believe that he would agree so easily. He was practically forcing her on us.
""Yes,"" He nodded.
""Thank you,"" I smiled. He smiled too.
""Are you going to have lunch with Bobby?"" He asked.
""Yes,"" I answered.
Bobby and I had our usual lunch at least twice a week at the park across from our office building. We'd grab burgers or tacos from street vendors, sit on a bench, and watch people pass by while Bobby made snide comments about their outfits. She was unapologetically blunt.
""Okay, have fun with her."" He smiled tenderly. ""Come here and give me a smooch.""
I got up and walked around his desk, and when I was in front of him, he pulled me into his lap. ""I love you,"" He whispered, before he pressed his lips against mine, lingering there for a while.
""I love you too."" I said to him, my heart softening.
We said goodbye, and I headed for the door. But just before walking out, I glanced back at him and gave a small wave.
That's when I noticed it.
A small pouch sat on the coffee table in the sitting area.
Pink.
The same one Elsa always carried with her everywhere.
That meant Cole had a meeting with Elsa not on his work desk. But on the sofa.
And that bothered me. A lot.
I glanced back at my husband, but he was already on the phone, discussing something about a takeover.
Frowning, I looked at the pouch again, deciding I would ask him about it later when we were home.
And then I heard something. A sound. Like something had fallen to the floor.
I brushed it off and kept walking, only to find Lawrence and Maisie watching me intently again. My eyes narrowed at them, but they didn't say anything. I could still feel their stares on me as I made my way to the elevator.
As the car began to descend, a thought suddenly crossed my mind.
The sound had come from my right.
The right side of the room had the sitting area‚Äîand the door that led to Cole's private bathroom.
But Cole had been sitting at his desk on the left side of the room.
There couldn't have been someone in that bathroom the entire time I was there... could there?
Bobby was saying something about a girl in a red dress‚Äîsomething about it making her look like she had a third tit‚Äîbut I couldn't focus on her words.
My mind was still on that pink pouch‚Äîand that sound.
I was losing my mind, trying to make sense of it all.
And Elsa's pouch was right there.
Elsa‚Äîthe pregnant, unmarried, gorgeous woman.
Bobby's eyes trailed a woman wearing a massive bow on her back. ""I sincerely respect the commitment to bad fashion,"" she mused, still watching her. ""That took guts.""
I didn't respond.
She poked my waist, pulling me from my thoughts. I glanced at her‚Äîmy best friend, with her striking red and purple hair‚Äîraising an eyebrow.
""What's wrong with you?"" she asked. ""You've been zoning out for over an hour now.""
I shook my head. ""Nothing.""
""Your face says otherwise."" She frowned. ""Spill it.""
I wasn't sure if I should tell her. I didn't even know if this hunch‚Äîthis suspicion‚Äîwas real or just in my head.
Bobby was one of Cole's best friends from college. There were four of them‚ÄîSteve and Archie were the other two‚Äîand they were inseparable.
Bobby and Cole had built their careers side by side, backed each other through every success and failure, and knew each other better than anyone else. Loyalty ran deep between them. If I told Bobby what was on my mind, there would be a good chance it would get back to Cole.
Bobby was also Cole's second-in-command, the only person he fully trusted in his company. She had helped him build both businesses from the ground up, leading the real estate agency while Cole handled development. They worked so seamlessly together that it sometimes felt like they could read each other's minds.
Steve was Cole's go-to lawyer, handling all legal matters exclusively. When Cole insisted on having him despite Steve being a junior associate at the time, the firm resisted, but Cole's business was too valuable to lose. Since then, they had worked together flawlessly.
Archibald, a journalist, was the most elusive of the group. His work kept him away for long stretches, and he rarely spoke about it. We only learned about his stories once they hit the news. His discretion was unwavering, and we eventually stopped asking.
I had grown close to them, especially Bobby, but they had been Cole's friends first. And sometimes, when doubt crept in, I couldn't help but wonder where their loyalties truly lay.
Bobby was still watching me, waiting for an answer.
""You know Cole very well, don't you, Bobby?"" I asked quietly.
She nodded, confusion flickering across her face.
""He would never betray me... would he?""
Bobby looked taken aback. ""Why would you even ask that?""
I looked away, giving a small shrug. ""Just asking.""
She held my gaze. ""He loves you, Sara. You know that.""
""I know.""
But still... that nagging feeling wouldn't go away.
I was about to say something, but a voice behind me cut in.
""I see you two still have lunch in the park.""
I perked up immediately, recognizing the voice. Bobby, however, tensed beside me.
Turning around, I came face to face with a tall guy‚Äîplatinum blond hair, mesmerizing green eyes, and tattoos creeping over his collar‚Äîgrinning at me.
""Archie!"" I squealed, jumping up from the bench. I spun around and threw my arms around him. He let out a chuckle, wrapping me in a tight hug before lifting me off the ground for a second.
""Miss me, Peaches?"" he teased, setting me back down. He'd been calling me Peaches for as long as I could remember, and he never once told me why. I had stopped asking long ago because he always dodged the question.
I rolled my eyes but couldn't stop smiling. ""It's been forever! Where have you been?""
""Somewhere in the middle east."" He said simply. His gaze flicked to Bobby, who was still seated, arms crossed, watching us with a blank expression.
Knowing him, that was probably the best answer I was going to get. So, I just nodded, choosing not to press further.
""Hi, jerk,"" Bobby said to him.
""Bobby,"" he drawled, tilting his head. ""Still as charming as ever, I see.""
Bobby huffed, shooting him a look. ""Still as annoying as ever, I see.""
There was history between these two‚Äîmessy, complicated history. A year ago, they slept together, which they both knew was a mistake. It had the potential to ruin their friendship, and Bobby had gone ahead and shattered it completely by dumping Archie and then sleeping with Julian, his younger brother, instead.
Her excuse was simple‚ÄîArchie never loved her anyway. His heart had always belonged to another woman.
I never probed further. It wasn't my business.
I spotted my husband striding toward us, scowling at his best friend. ""That's enough,"" Cole growled, flicking a hand in warning. ""Get your filthy hands off my wife.""
Archie's hands flew up as he let go of me.
""Hey, baby,"" Cole greeted, leaning down to press a smooch to my lips.
""Don't I get a smooch too?"" Archie quipped.
""Not in front of my wife,"" Cole shot back, smirking.
Archie chuckled.
""How's lunch?"" Cole turned to me, looking at me affectionately.
My mind went to that pouch and that sound again. I couldn't get it out of my head.
""It's fine."" I said tensely.
His brow furrowed in concern, noticing something was off with me. ""Something's wrong?""
Before I could answer, his phone buzzed. He took it out of his coat's pocket and glanced at the screen.
""Hold that thought,"" he said, picking up the phone. ""Yeah?"" His expression shifted, his voice tightening. ""I'll be there soon... Just wait for me.""
Cole glanced at me, remorse flickering in his eyes. ""I'm sorry, babe, I have to go.""
He had already turned away, about to walk off, when I called after him. ""Where?""
""Some crisis,"" he said briskly, and started to jog. ""I'll explain when I get home.""
He sprinted across the park toward the reserved parking lot in front of the lobby, leaving me standing there, completely stunned. I barely had time to process what had just happened before I turned to Archie, who was already watching me with confusion.
""What?"" he asked. ""What are you thinking?""
I was frozen for a moment, my eyes shifted again, tracking Cole's car as it sped through the driveway. Then, suddenly, I bolted.
""Sara!"" Archie and Bobby called out in unison, trailing behind me. ""Where are you going?""
I didn't answer. I had a bad feeling about this. Call it intuition, but I needed to see this through. Reaching the curb, I frantically searched for a taxi.
""Sara, where are you going?"" Archie shouted, but I ignored him, waving down an approaching cab.
Miraculously, an empty taxi pulled up in front of me. I yanked the door open and jumped in. ""Follow that car!"" [Read more](https://novels-for-all.com/best-novel-platforms)",1,1742506488.0,Novelideas,0,1.0,False

Option 1: smaller, more expensive, but sunnier and located on a street with a ton of coffee shops and restaurants, which we really wanted. E 78 and York

Option 2: larger, cheaper, but located up near the highway next to Carl Schurz park. Fully residential street with not much going on.

My question is this: given that both apartments are equal in terms of value, what's the better location?

We are moving to NYC for the first time and we want the true UES experience. We love going to coffee shops and walking around a vibrant city landscape. However, the 88th street option isn't too far and is also next to a beautiful park on the water. Is the prime location of the 78 street apartment worth it, or would we be naive not to take a bigger, cheaper place up on 88th?

1jg0b77,https://www.reddit.com/r/policeuk/comments/1jg0b77/a_question_for_traffic_officers_around_zebra/,A question for traffic officers around zebra crossings.,"I have a couple of zebra crossings near where I live that are constantly parked on, usually the zig-zags and often the crossing itself, it makes crossing at the crossings a bit perilous (there also seems to be a bit of a local issue of people just not stopping for pedestrians at those crossing anyway, doubly so when you've got vans etc.. parked up and can't see).

On a semi-regular basis we have marked police cars parked up a little way up the road (cafe provides free tea and coffee to cops I believe..), and I went and asked one of the officers there about it and they told me that there is nothing that the police can do, that its a council issue. The council will let you make a report, but email you back a few days later to say that the car/van whatever reported wasn't there when they drove past (not surprising given they aren't sitting there for days...). 

Is this really something that the police (who will regularly come across it as it is happening) can't deal with, or is it just such a low priority that they won't? And if its the latter, is there any way to push for a day or two of action from someone just get the message across to the drivers that do take the piss regularly that they might get caught out?",0,1742506432.0,policeuk,6,0.5,False

1jg0ass,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoysOfTommen/comments/1jg0ass/i_understand_lizzie_and_dislike_claire/,I Understand Lizzie and Dislike Claire,"THERE ARE SOME SPOILERS!!

In my opinion, I actually like Lizzie and she's my second favorite fmc in this book (obviously Aoife's #1) and think their story will be my second favorite (again second to Joey and Aoife's). 

I want to preface that while I feel I do understand where she is coming from, doesn't mean that I think her actions are acceptable.

I think it's hard for people to separate the anger they might feel towards her. I see that people mostly hate her for the constant bullying towards Gibsie and the occasional jabs at Katie. Lizzie is throwing around Gibsie's dad and sisters death at him, saying he is just like is brother, etc. But she doesn't know what we as readers do. She possibly sees that one of her closest friend from childhood and his family (that could have felt like hers too) support the family member that lead her sister's death by her own hands. Honestly, if I put my self in that situation, I would RAGE on who I thought was my closest friend. And yes, Gisbie does say to her that he doesn't like Mark to her at time but she doesn't believe it and I don't necessarily know why, but there has to be a reason. Probably doesn't because of what we don't know yet, like everything that went down with the trial that will hopefully come up in her book.

I also understand her occasional jabs. With Claire, Johnny, and Katie. With Claire, she could be battling her feelings of knowing that Claire and Gibsie are close but can also see it as support for what happened with her sister. Johnny's support for Gibsie and snapping at Lizzie at times when he doesn't know the story or how it went down at all (I do love his loyalty to Gisbie). Katie for the obvious reasons, she is ""taking"" her best friend/lover away from her even knowing she is at fault since she has been pushing Hughie away. 

I think the ones that truly see her are Feely and Hughie, and now Shannon getting a little glimpse. When Feely said something about her being the loneliest person he has seen and left the table. I don't think that is a read or a jab that the others thought. I think he was letting her know that he sees her. That the walls she built, her pushing everyone away, and making other people hurt to disguise her pain. Hughie knows more than anyone and I look forward to see why she needs to keep him at a distance and why they broke up. I think Shannon is getting closer with her from their babysitting gig. She said that Lizzie is stuck every day in her pain with no resolution and time is moving on for everyone else was really well said.

I believe that Lizzie still cares for Gibsie but hates herself for still having a part of her that does. From when she pushed him in the water, she was originally blinded by rage and pain and when she did that, you could tell that she was distraught at when she did and truly felt bad. Feely backed her up and took a walk with her because he understands her too. 

She is clearly in pain and is doing the tale was old as time. She is disguising her pain in anger and lashes at people to not see her vulnerable and broken side and most likely, self hate. Which is how she was able to tell that Gibsie blames himself for his sister and dad's death, from that scene in the coffee shop. And yes the truth came out about what really went down with her sister's death and gibsie, she needs time to process it and I don't fault her for her reaction actually. They will clearly mend their relationship eventually but this has been years of trauma and pain that can't be washed away in an instant from a letter that she thinks is not real and Gisbie never telling her the truth. He doesn't need to reveal his SA or need any justification on why he didn't share, but that hate has festered for Lizzie for a long time.

I predict that she is going to confide a lot in Joey and he is going to help her through her pain. But I also think that he is going to snap at her on accident and she will truly feel alone. And that maybe he is going to repay her for what she did for him on the bridge and she is going to do something similar and he is going to save her or convince her to get the help she needs. You can tell her life is crumbling and we only have a small window to see what she is going through. Her parents divorce, sister's death, her mother clearly not well or present and lizzie is trying to take care of her, losing her friends, self harm, etc. 

Also, side note on why I dislike Claire. I HATE where she tells everyone Gibs story. She said she didn't mean to say it but she doesn't apologize for standing up for him. Where she ""gives"" Shannon permission to share HIS letter that Caoimhe gave him to share to Johnny. I hate how that all went down, how she felt she had the permission to share something he was working up the courage to do so on his own time.",1,1742506407.0,BoysOfTommen,2,0.6,False

My husband and I are both allergic and everybody knows this. To be fair we hadn‚Äôt remembered how bad it was as we generally avoid so we decided to try and rub along as there had been some tension on that side of the family and we didn‚Äôt want to make it worse.

Well Christmas Day at my in laws was awful. The puppy was there being disgusting and interrupting everything but mostly I felt SO unwell by the end of the day and continued to feel dreadful right into the 27th so it basically ruined Christmas.

Fast forward a week or so later and BILs gf asks to bring the dog over to our house for something we were hosting and we said no because our allergies had been too bad at Christmas. She performatively attended for one solid hour and then promptly didn‚Äôt speak to either of us for 3 months.

Anyway my husband met his brother for a coffee and explained how we just couldn‚Äôt deal with the dog it made us feel awful and it would be best to totally minimise interaction and if we went over could it be shut away so that it wasn‚Äôt jumping up at us and making our allergies worse. BIL agreed to this no problem - he‚Äôs not the villain in this story.

Last week we had them over for dinner which was okay and broke the ice a bit, and tonight they asked if we wanted to pop over for a cup of tea so we said sure thinking we had all agreed to just rub along now and the feud was over. Turns out it was a test and we failed.

We arrived. BIL asked his gf to put the dog in the crate or outside and you guys she flat out just refused in front of us it was so awkward. An utter performance was then made of holding onto the dog and taking it in turns to have conversations in different rooms because WE were apparently being difficult. Eventually BIL shoved some food in the dog‚Äôs crate and plonked it in there which is what could have happened all along. She gave him many dirty looks for this. Many passive aggressive comments were made. Horrible time was had by all.

So anyway I am sitting here wondering who invites someone into their home and then goes out of their way to make them feel as uncomfortable as possible and expose them to something that makes them feel physically unwell? You wouldn‚Äôt invite an asthmatic over and then smoke in the doorway with the door open. You wouldn‚Äôt invite someone with a nut allergy over and serve satay curry. You wouldn‚Äôt invite a vegan over and fail to provide a vegan option.

Anyway so now I am itchy and irritated and everything is worse than it was before.",2,1742506371.0,Dogfree,1,0.75,False

Besides my desk and my bed, I don't have any of my own space. It was a year's battle to get some curtains for privacy, but she'll still barge in whenever she feels. I live in a clutter of clothes because the closet doors outside my ""room"" are covered by boxes. The space I could have my keyboard is a castle of boxes, full of things she hasn't used in years. I do everything to make my room look cute, but it feels like putting lipstick on a pig. I don't have a bathtub anymore, it's full of plastic containers and bags. They were gone for a few days, and I had someone over, ""Did you know you have black mold on your ceiling?"" I don't have a TV anymore, because the power button is hidden by a cluttered coffee table, one I never asked for. When I asked them why I don't have a room, ""we just never thought you'd need one"", I think that says enough for their regard to my privacy and space. I don't want to talk about my parents' room.

I feel so bad for my puppy.   
The kitchen is just embarrassing. The fridge is terrifying, it's like she plays Tetris with huge packages of food we'll never finish. I never want to look at the back of it because I'd rather stay ignorant than know what she's actually been feeding me. At this point, I probably have a stomach of steel from all this expired food. 

I remember being 7 and my friend needed to use the restroom, so I took him to my door. She covered his eyes and yelled at him not to look while guiding him to the bathroom. That's when I realized this wasn't normal.

We started to get roaches, they blamed it on me. If I complained that I couldn't get to the washing machine because random plastic gates were blocking it, I'd get two hours of screaming that I brought them in my backpack from my grandma's house. Once I cleared out my freezer with a kind friend, and when they came back, my mom almost ripped my head off. I remember telling her there were sausages from 2014 in there, and she said they were still packaged so they were fine. My dad just shrugged. Every time I've brought up moving out, he called me irresponsible and said I'll come running back to them. Yeah right, I've felt better in hotel rooms than sleeping in my bed/couch. I need to get out, I've given up on trying to argue or help.

I'm sick of false promises and lies. It's always, ""I'll do it tomorrow"", or ""I'll have time for it next week"", or ""I'm tired"". But she always has the energy to bring more stuff in. Once I backed her into a conversation about the apartment, we were in the car so she couldn't walk away or slam the door on me. So, she kicked me out of the cramped, cluttered car and I had to walk home for 20 minutes in the cold rain. My jacket was in the car, smothered by boxes. 

I get so jealous I want to cry when I come over to my friend's houses and they have hallways they can walk through without bumping their hip or stubbing their toe. They have a room they feel safe and comfortable in, I want that. I like cuddling with my boyfriend, but nothing feels cute and sexy around towers of stuff. I would stay as long as possible at my friends' houses since I was allowed to have sleepovers. If they (somehow) went to my place, they'd usually find an excuse to leave, I could tell it made them anxious. Why do they get to live normally and I don't? Why me? I've never felt at home in my house.

This grinder is flawless and continues to look and operate exactly the same as when I first unboxed it. If you set it next to a brand new Lagom P64 you would not be able to tell which one was older. I'm not embellishing here at all - it actually still looks brand new.

I use this grinder every day, 3-5 times a day or more, making coffee for myself, my wife, and our friends. I do espresso and pour-over, all with the SSP multipurpose burrs.

The P64 achieves exactly what it was designed to do. I can switch between multiple different beans and brewing methods effortlessly. A simple twist of the grinder dial and I can go from medium roast flat whites to light roasted pour-overs and any other permutation you can think of. There's no retention, no mess, and no fussing around whatsoever.

If you have heard of this grinder and you're wondering if the hype is real, I can tell you that after 5 years I've never found a single complaint about this machine.

The reason I'm reviewing the P64 is because not many products are built this way anymore. It has really surprised me with its perfect design and over-the-top build quality. I'll admit, the price did make my eyes water a little bit, but having used it for 5 years now, I've never once regretted this purchase.

I‚Äôve cut my ApoB in half through dietary changes alone.  

M38, BMI 21.5

Lipid changes since October:  
- ApoB: 114 ‚Üí 54 mg/dL  
- LDL: 133 ‚Üí 69 mg/dL  
- Triglycerides: 132 ‚Üí 77 mg/dL  
- Lipoprotein(a): <10 nmol/L (normal: <74 nmol/L per Quest Diagnostics)  

My LDL had been around 130 for at least the past four years. I didn‚Äôt take any meaningful action because I thought it wasn‚Äôt that high. That changed last year when I had my ApoB tested for the first time and got a result of 114. That was my wake-up call. I started researching more and realized it was time to take this seriously.  

To be fair, my diet was already considered ""good."" I avoided added sugar and junk food, and I always take the skin off chicken. Since I have a family history of type 2 diabetes later in life, I kept an eye on my carb intake. However, I completely overlooked my saturated fat intake.  

Dietary Changes:  
I started cooking all my meals at home, weighing everything on a kitchen scale, and logging everything in Cronometer to get an objective view of my macros, saturated fat, and fiber intake.  

My daily targets (on a ~2500 kcal diet):
- Saturated fat: <11g  
- Fiber: 40‚Äì50g  

Breakfast:
- 50g rolled oats  
- Sliced apple and/or banana  
- 1 tbsp ground flaxseed  
- 10g sunflower seeds or 5g pumpkin seeds  
- 10g raisins, prunes, or sun-dried apricots  
- 25g nuts (I avoid high-saturated-fat nuts like cashews/macadamias)  
- 28g unflavored whey isolate (low in saturated fat)  

Snack:
- Latte (1 cup skim milk + coffee)  
- Homemade low-sugar, low-saturated-fat snack (e.g., slice of carrot/orange cake)  or Yasso Icecream 

Lunch:
- 45‚Äì50g whole grains (wheat, quinoa, barley, buckwheat, brown rice, etc.)  
- Protein: chicken breast, roasted salmon, or canned sardines  
- Salad with olive oil (amount depends on my saturated fat intake for the day‚Äîeither 0.5 or 1 tbsp, or sometimes no oil at all)  
- Fruit (orange, pear, clementine)  

Snack:
- 150g fat-free Greek yogurt  
- 20‚Äì25g almond or peanut butter (no added palm oil or sugar‚Äîmostly almond butter since it‚Äôs lower in saturated fat, but I switch to peanut butter if my budget allows)  
- 50g blueberries  
- Additional fruit  

Dinner: (400‚Äì600 kcal to reach my 2500 kcal target)  
- Lots of legumes (chickpeas, black beans, tofu)  
- Whole wheat pita or roasted vegetables  
- ¬Ω avocado  
- 100g steamed broccoli
-Fruit 

Supplements:
- Multivitamins (I avoid megadoses)  
- Fish oil (only on days I don‚Äôt eat fatty fish; I choose high-EPA fish oil since it has a neutral effect on LDL compared to DHA and keep my intake below 1g)  

Exercise:
I haven‚Äôt been actively exercising for 1.5 years due to a medical issue, but I still hit my 10,000 steps daily.

Cronometer Data (Last 4 Weeks):
Macro Split:
 Protein: 22%
 Carbs: 49%

Brazil will leap back in front of Colombia in the race to qualify for the 2026 World Cup provided it beats La Tricolor at the Arena BRB Mane Garrincha in Brasilia on Thursday evening. Both teams have failed to win either of their last two qualifying matchups, though Brazil‚Äôs form at least appears to be on an upward curve after a dismal stretch of results towards the back end of 2023. And it was amid that barren run that Colombia managed to overcome the Selecao in the reverse of this fixture, emerging as a 2-1 victor in Barranquilla to mark its first win over Brazil since 2015.

Colombia coach remains undefeated against Brazil in two attempts as a head coach, having also drawn 1-1 against the South American giants when they faced off in last year‚Äôs Copa Am√©rica.

The stakes are a lot higher this time around, however, as the Coffee Growers sit fourth in CONMEBOL qualifying on 19 points, a single point ahead of Brazil in fifth place

It was during the group stage of the 2024 Copa Am√©rica that Colombia came from behind to secure a 1-1 draw against Dorival Junior‚Äôs side en route to topping their pool.

Brazil failed to hold onto its lead as a half-time leveller from Crystal Palace defender Daniel Munoz  secured a 1-1 draw for Colombia the last time these countries faced off:

More than 15 years have passed since Brazil last failed to beat Colombia in three consecutive meetings, never mind losing twice to this foe in such quick succession.

Brazil was close to having Neymar back after a 17-month lay-off, but injury has since forced the Santos star to withdraw as Real Madrid forward Endrick comes in as his replacement.

Meanwhile, Jhon Duran has retained his spot for Colombia after a prolific run since moving to Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr, while captain James Rodriguez will hope to keep having an impact on the international scale.

*Potential Spoiler Warning*

**Reasons the Ending is fake:**

* Music clues didn‚Äôt make sense and cannot be reverse engineered.
* Anghkooey meaning remember didn‚Äôt make sense and cannot be reverse engineered.
* Molotov cocktails and monster capture setups never paid off.
* Julie and Ethan are going to be mourning all over again.
* Cost very little to do, actors admitted to improvising segments.
* Many 1 on 1 conversations in the woods.
* Reincarnation is already very difficult to pull off with different actors and accents, but even more so with actors with unique acting styles like David and Catalina.
* Reincarnation and time-travel combined is a mess.¬†
* Juli‚Äôs form of time-travel is a very strange astral projection that makes little sense to me.

**The Prank and the Fake Ending**

I believe the last 3 episodes of ""FROM"" S3 are not the real conclusion but part of an elaborate prank and publicity stunt. The ending we saw was fake, written and directed by the actors with support from the showrunners and MGM+. We‚Äôll get three hour special, perhaps including a double bill and extended episode, and we‚Äôll get to binge it all at once.

**Clues Point to April Fools‚Äô Day**

[ \(NB: 3 years 4 months is the length of the cycle - which begins around important massacres, e.g. the Fort Pillow Massacre\).¬†](https://preview.redd.it/t0yfpcd2rwpe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c4146487651319b1cab048d96e8502c78cebae0)

Evidence suggests the real ending will drop on April Fools‚Äô Day. In Donna‚Äôs room, there‚Äôs a calendar with a question mark on the space after March 31st, which is April 1^(st).

This clue was prominently shown in the finale, inside the room where Elgin was tortured. The calendar strongly hints that the prank connects to April Fools‚Äô Day, signalling when the true ending will be revealed. The actors have also dropped the word ‚Äúfool‚Äù in some interviews.

https://preview.redd.it/krln71x6rwpe1.png?width=2222&format=png&auto=webp&s=774970162dd73881beab9dc47f608f9c3af4ee10

I think they might quietly swap out the episodes, change the titles, and watch the world explode.

**Suspicion from Actor Interviews**

My suspicion about the fake ending comes partly from actor interviews. I noticed duper‚Äôs delight in their expressions‚Äîa sign they enjoyed fooling us. Before Season 3‚Äôs release, they dropped innumerable clues like mentions of explosions and kept hinting these even after the finale. Yet, no explosions appeared on screen, despite being set up by Kenny‚Äôs Molotov cocktails. I can‚Äôt express enough just how many clues the show-runners have left, in both the dialogue of the show and in the interviews themselves that have not materialised. Almost every interview is entirely scripted, and where not, the actors improvise.¬†

Interestingly, a huge number of these clues point to Amazon‚Äôs biggest stars - specifically their filmography. More on that later.

**Predictions for the Real Ending:**

*NB: the chronology of events and individuals performing each action will likely be very different.*

**Suspicion and Lists:** Tilly‚Äôs murder gets accusations thrown around, and lists made. Sarah is hunted down by angry people, put on trial and judged guilty, then put in the box. She survives the night.

**Jasper:** the ventriloquist doll will speak in a creepy voice and do some Chucky-like things around town. Ethan will speak with the Boy in White.

**Bridge Discovery:** There will be a bottomless abyss with a broken bridge and a cliff, with something interesting on the other side.

**Construction and Invention:** Jim and Jade build a revved up motorbike together, which Ellis or Harold jump the chasm at 68mph to make a radio call up a mountain (or in the lighthouse). A Canadian answers, or they hear the Titanic distress signal.

**Preparing a Bomb:** Jade will build a nuclear steam-pressure bomb to destroy Fromland as revenge, made from the reactor of the fallen (and very heavy) Kosmos 954 satellite with a one minute timer by removing its fuel rods and exploding its casing near water.¬†

**Salvaging a Life Raft:** A 1990 Faucett Per√∫ Boeing 727 plane will be found and its inflatable life rafts and life vests collected.

**Kidnap**: Fatima is captured and kept in the caves near a frozen lake. Elgin was indeed trying to help, trying to give her somewhere safe to give birth.¬†

**Catching a Monster:** Boyd will capture a monster using water and the Mabuse defibrillation paddles. He will strap it to the chair and torture it in the church‚Äôs basement to learn of her location by turning a screw.

**Solar Storm and/or Eclipse**: The sun will make everything extremely bright and hot. People will need to blindfold themselves and walk in a chain, holding each other, to deal with the harsh conditions. This may be followed by an eclipse. Both of these may occur in 1978 also. Either way, there is a massacre where monsters run freely, talismans fail, and nobody can see anything.¬†

**Colony House Under Siege:** Donna shuts down Colony House and defends it with her axe and shotgun until it is overwhelmed and the house is set on fire. We may see the true form of the monsters without their glamour.

**The Battle**: Several Fromily, including Ellis, Boyd and Kenny, will gear up with baseball equipment and go full Rambo-mode, throwing Molotov cocktails in the caves. They may find mines, and pick-axes, and burn a lot of spider eggs.¬†

**Elgin and Fatima**: Fatima will give birth in the dark via cesarean section. Her baby might be a shape-shifting changeling‚Äî(tinfoil: there could be twins, or just Thomas alone instead). This changeling will go back in time and swap itself with Thomas.¬†

Tinfoil: The bogeyman may then raise Thomas in another timeline.

**Remembering:** Tabitha will remember she is Eloise. Jade will remember he is Thomas.

**Possession and Kidnapping**: Several characters will be possessed by invisible spirits that have been haunting the town, watching and interacting, knocking, whispering, and indeed one of whom threw the rope. These people turn psychopathic and after doing drugs, feasting and behaving as if they‚Äôve only a day left to live, they capture seven others, bringing them to Khatri‚Äôs stone circle. It may be that cicadas burrow into their heads through their ears and other orifices.

**Ritual**: Possessed people will play music with various instruments, like a violin, a guitar, a tambourine. There may be singing. The music will mimic the song from the fake ending but with richer tones. Cicadas dig through the back of the skulls of Juli, Marielle and Randall to control them. They do unique, almost interpretive dancing too.

Drugs like alcohol, morphine, cannabis, tobacco, coffee, mushrooms, and potion making of some kind will be involved. Each character will wear a different colour, and their clothing will unravel and fray as the ritual unfolds, forming a rainbow blanket/bridge. Various jewels and objects may also be involved. So too may substances like salt, pepper, honey, oats etc. So too will various fruits and berries like oranges, limes.

The possessed intend to harvest organs from their sacrifices, squeeze the organs for bodily fluids, and consume them. Animals will burst out of the possessed‚Äôs bodies and evolve and grow into seven giant monsters from modern European-Canadian folklore, including Big Foot, a Giant Squid, a Sea Serpent, a Giant Spider, the Grim Reaper and Bonne-Homme Sept-Heures.

https://preview.redd.it/ocvufqyjrwpe1.jpg?width=1903&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6e0a188024eae022400d5f6e8cc74df564bc336

John Griffin makes much of the fact that FROM is a fable in his latest interview. What is a fable? A story where animals, legendary creatures, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature are anthropomorphised.¬†

**Drink off, Truth or Dare, Russian Roulette Monologue and Trick**: The bogeyman (Bonnehomme Septheures) is embodied as a skinny stinking tall man with long coat, top-hat and bag of sand. He likes to play with his food. There‚Äôs a game of truth or dare. Jade will trick the bogeyman by pretending to be unconscious after a drinking game. Boyd will then challenge the bogeyman to a game of Russian roulette. But he will trick him by secretly filling his belly with alcohol, punching Jade‚Äôs belly to projectile vomit out of his mouth, shooting himself while doing the same, which will set himself on fire as he blows the three of them up. Jade will be part of this plan and contribute to the vomiting.

**Battle Royale**: Essentially, the seven spirits have been competing to fill the humans with different emotions, letting some stay alive longer to gather more, then harvesting then via bodily fluids in the organs, ultimately to power their transformations into monsters of modern North East Canadian Mythology (in this timeline), and also cataclysmic powers such as rainstorms, hailstorms, windstorms, freezes, boiling solar storms, tidal waves, floods, quicksand, earthquakes, eclipses and more. The dragon may be able to freeze people to stone like Medusa.

A massive battle royale will occur beside the Brundles, where the Polar Bear and perhaps the Bogeyman and Dragon win, potentially distributing winnings of treasure and magical artefacts. Tilly may fly around on a broom.

**The Canadian Mole:** We‚Äôll learn Clara is secretly Canadian, making her a mole - alternatively she‚Äôs like Sarah. Either way, she tampers with Fromily‚Äôs plans.

**The Bomb:** Jade may need to disarm the bomb, and forget his iPhone password or run out of battery. Jade is injured. Dying from claw injuries, he recreates the story Julie tells to Ethan with the finger puppets, telling someone (Likely Ethan or if not, Julie or Victor) to tell his parents (Jim and Tabitha) he loves them and to tell his friends (of which he now has many) he said goodbye. The ‚Äúsecret fairies‚Äù monsters are closing in, and Jade is beside the bomb, which Ethan sets off by flipping a switch, destroying the fairies and burying them all.¬†

**Victor‚Äôs Escape:** Victor returns to the modern day real world through a red door in the air.

**Time-travel Through the Bottle Tree**: In the chaos, some characters get on the life raft, and others enter the bottle tree to escape. Jade will have solved the puzzle using the 17th Fibonacci number or the Golden Ratio, relating to time and space. But they can only choose a place, not the time. They‚Äôll go through anyway, some holding hands.

**Multiple Timelines**: Several characters will time-travel to up to seven timelines: the 1930s, 1880s, 1860s, 1770s, and 1670s. In the 1860s, we‚Äôll see Crazy Horse and Okie Ito. In the 1880s Fromland, there‚Äôll be a lion, a baby elephant named Columbia, PT Barnum‚Äôs Circus Train, and several circus ‚Äúfreaks‚Äù and a clown. We may see some mafia guys in 1930s. Some characters may even end up in a future version of Fromland.

**Matthews family in 1978**: Tabitha, Julie, Jim and Ethan will travel to 1978. Ethan will shoot a younger version of his drunken grandfather (or Henry), who was scaring Julie, using Victor‚Äôs gun stolen from the post office (it may even be the bearded man in the root cellar). Julie will encounter and talk to the jock monster. They rescue Eloise and Thomas. Jim is captured, or killed. Jade remembers he was Thomas, and Tabitha remembers she was Eloise. They have ancestral memories too.

There will be a predestination paradox, where attempting to prevent an event from happening (Victor‚Äôs abandonment) actually ends up causing it. A future version of Juli may try to stop herself from time-traveling - to mimic a Polchinski paradox.

**Sophie‚Äôs Choice in 1978**: As they escape the monsters, Tabitha must choose between time-traveling with Julie, Eloise and Thomas, or returning to the real world with Ethan. She chooses Ethan, returning to the real world and living under an assumed name in the states. Julie time-travels to 1993 with Thomas and Eloise and escapes to the real world too.

**Julie, Eloise and Thomas in 1993**: Eloise and Thomas have lost theirs minds and has no memory. Julie will find herself near Tabitha and Stephen King‚Äôs house in Maine, and will seek shelter there.

**Eloise in 1993:** Tabitha King and Stephen King call the police with Julie‚Äôs permission, who place Eloise as a patient in an institution. Eloise is named Tabitha because that‚Äôs the name on the police report. Julie leaves a note with Eloise telling her to be kind to men named Jim‚Äîwhich Eloise‚Äôs adopted Colombian parents hide, but acknowledge.¬†Tabitha made her bracelet from subconscious memory of the very same bracelet she's making - creating a bootstrap paradox - which came first, if she copied the same bracelet she already made?

**Thomas in 1993:** Meanwhile, Julie drops off Thomas with a now much older Tabitha, telling her it‚Äôs her responsibility to raise him. With Ethan now old enough, Tabitha takes Thomas to France and raises him there, pretending to be his grandmother and naming him Jade. This makes Tabitha both his mother and ‚Äúgrandmother‚Äù, with Ethan and Julie being Jade‚Äôs siblings, Victor his uncle, Henry his grandfather.¬†

**We Have To Go Back in 1993:** Juli asks Ethan to come back to Fromland with her to help her rescue Jim. She may even have a bandaid on her head like Jack from Lost. Ethan refuses. Juli goes back and becomes a hermit, living alone.

**Stephen King‚Äôs House in 1993**: At the Kings‚Äô house, Julie receives a red book used as a diary by Philippe de Commines from Stephen King. We may get a flashback from the reading of this diary to John Cabot/Bridget of York and Tudor England.

I imagine it like this:

*Dartford Priory 1498*

*A nurse runs down a corridor with a candle, it's cold and a woman is screaming in pain. She opens the door and she's told to shut it quickly and asked if anyone saw her. Prioress Cressner seems concerned with secrecy than teenage Bridget, screaming in the bed, who is being hushed by the nuns - it's clear she's a nun herself. Bridget gives birth to a girl she names Agnes. Someone calls her a princess. Everyone is sworn to secrecy. Bridget is told she can leave the baby, but she is banished.*

**Real World 2005:** All Eloise had was her mother‚Äôs bracelet, and after growing up to be Tabitha, later copies from subconscious memory and gives to Jim. This bracelet returns to Fromland with time-traveling Juli visiting the hospital to watch her birth. She then goes to Tabitha‚Äôs funeral in France, and buys Jade a soda on her way back. Ethan is the uncle that Jade will live with in the real world now.

**Natural Disasters**: Jade‚Äôs bomb‚Äôs timer counts down and then goes off, setting off an earthquake that will fracture the ground, creating a giant hole and crumbling the town. A flood, twister, and rainstorm will follow. The rift will create whirlpool after a tidal wave.

**The Laser Battle:** Fromily will use the lighthouse‚Äôs fresnel lens to focus sun or starlight like a laser to burn the monsters.

**The Submarine:** Elgin and Randall take shelter in the remains of a British submarine, P-514, buried under the root cellar, its opening being what the hatch actually leads to - and is used as a bunker during the apocalypse. Later, they are deep underwater, seeing a giant squid, a great white shark, dolphins, porpoises, whales and a giant crab.

**The Ark**: The plane‚Äôs life raft will save people like Bhakta and Donna, and a loch-ness monster type sea serpent will chase the boat amid flare shots. A tidal wave will hit, and everything will be sucked into the hole, forming a whirlpool that pulls the boat through the core of Fromland, even where there‚Äôs no gravity, until they use a winched anchor hooked onto a tree to reel themselves back to the surface.¬†

**Journey to the Island**: Survivors in the boat will sail into an ocean following the North Star to an island. The survivors may catch a literal red herring to eat raw.

**The Lost Canadian Theme Park Tropical Island:** Jungles contain a rat-infested Canadian amusement park based on Trinity Loop in Newfoundland, with a Ferris Wheel, mini-golf, a Merry-Go-Round, four kings, teacup rides, and a roller coaster. A uniformed Mountie monster and Canadian sitcom stereotypes will be present. The town is populated by a Canadian community of ‚Äúothers,‚Äù played by former ""LOST"" cast members like Terry O‚ÄôQuinn, Josh Holloway, Matthew Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Emerson, led by a woman who might be an older version of Julie, who at one time was a Danielle Rousseau-type character.

I imagine it as the survivors getting off the lifeboat, staggering into a hot jungle, stumble out into a clearing with a rundown amusement park and ferris wheel...and then a mountie rides up them, yelling at them to ‚ÄúGet inside. It's not safe in the light.‚Äù¬†

**The World‚Äôs Shape**: We‚Äôll zoom out to Fromland to see its shape: a bubble/bottle surrounding a board, with Canadian Fromland on top, and American Fromland in the upside-down. We may see all these figures playing the game, with everyone in miniature in a diorama.

**The Realm of the Dead**: By the end, nobody else is left in the town, which may have crumbled entirely. Many major characters are dead, and this round of the game is lost. The dead‚Äôs souls will be stored in trees growing from seeds. People may be shrunk into a snow globe or something like that.

Their ghosts will arrive in a black and white filmed, root-filled hellscape‚Äîa mirror-realm of the dead‚Äîfull of townsfolk ancestors and people in white or grey, including an older woman, and perhaps Michael Emerson. This will involve Cleopatra and Marc Anthony‚Äôs tomb or pyramid, with mummies. Ultimately, many of the main cast are ‚Äúon ice‚Äù until they can be resurrected. It‚Äôs likely the world of the dead is completely silent, where none can speak, but if not, the ghosts might only be able to say one word: ‚ÄúANGHKOOEY!‚Äù

**Severance Crossover and John Griffin Cameo:** Series creator John Griffin could make a surprise appearance on Severance alongside Harold Perrineau, whilst Ben Stiller and Adam Scott make an appearance on FROM. Alternately it will be in the alt-ending itself.

**Canadian Fromland Spinoff with American Actors:** MGM+ alternate seasons of release.¬†

**Time-travel Fromland Spinoff:** Includes new cast from the future and surviving cast stuck in the past. I suspect there will be a converging timeline endgame, capping everything off with a crossover feature-film with limited theatrical release finale.

**Amazon All-Star Reunion Reality TV Candid Camera Escape Room Spinoff**

Since the show first began, the Youtube Interviews have hidden a unique puzzle hidden, pointing to many, many celebrities, as well as the sequence for the finale.

It‚Äôs actually fascinating how the clues seem to point to both simultaneously ‚Äî the clues in FROM rhyme in many ways.

I theorise that a unique show has been secretly filmed in Nova Scotia, where actors from major franchises associated with Midnight Radio, Amazon Studios, Paramount, and MGM+ were discreetly invited to the exclusive event for unscripted filming. Participants signed comprehensive NDAs to ensure complete secrecy.

Lured in by an all-expenses-paid, relaxed getaway at Fox Harb‚Äôr resort for a reunion show, alongside former cast-mates as well as colleagues from other studios, the celebrities would arrive by coach in Fromtown.

I picture it as a reality-TV candid-camera ‚Äúhaunted house‚Äù prank and escape-room reunion show filmed on the existing FROM set. Unsuspecting actors would arrive by coach, while select FROM cast members may portray their actual characters. Celebrities then encouraged their friends to take part and be pranked in turn.

There‚Äôs a chance this may be a Halloween special, or it may even be a relaunched of Punk‚Äôd. The scripted television writers strikes would have helped secure all these big names if they filmed some of it in 2023.

Some background:
I get myoclonic seizures, meaning very small ones that look like whole body muscle jerks
I've been experiencing this for 2 years now

1. Can i still have caffine?
multiple sites say caffine isnt good, but when i have caffine i get less of the little seizures. I do get kinda shaky but not so much that it effects my daily tasks
so is it ok to have?, i miss my redbulls and iced coffees 

2. Tiredness 
Im currently taking Keppra, its going very well and i havnt had any seizures in about 3 days (seems short but is very good for me)
The problem is how tired I am
It gets very hard not to fall asleep in my classes and i often have 3-4 hour naps everyday
has anyone experienced this, does it get better? is there anything i can do to help feel not so tired?

3. How do i go about telling people around me?
I've told close friends and family, but i feel others should be aware at least a little of what im going through. 
should i just make an instagram post explaining or what?

4. How to process?
There are alot of things i cant do by myself or at all now. Does it take time to come to terms with that, or should i open up about how i feel.
I'm told ill never be able to scuba dive, as someone who wants to be a marine biologist this is very hard, as well as swimming in open water. 
I know this is for my own safety, but some of my favourite things or dreams aren't realistic anymore. 
Does anyone have tips on how to deal with this news?

I've been taking 10 in the morning, then 5 and 5 spaced out to try to offset an evening crash. Some days I take it with coffee and some days without. I've found that drinking coffee really helps offset the withdrawal once the adderall wears off.

Not sure how much coffee I'm drinking, I have a 1.42 L bottle of cold brew coffee that I keep by me and sip out of occasionally for a boost. Takes maybe 3 or so days to go through the whole thing (125mg caffiene per 12oz, 4 servings per container, 500mg caffeine in the entirety, so its not super strong cuz i definitely dont go through the whole thing in a day).

I am a little concerned about my heart/blood pressure, though.

I get some mild chest pain directly over my heart, like maybe it's the rib muscles or something. This happened a bit when I was a teen, too, and I got an EEG done for it but they figured it was just musculoskeletal since they didn't see anything wrong. I had some wicked anxiety as a kid.

I know stimulants (adderall or coffee or whatever) are strenuous on the heart. How much should I worry? What are some definite red flags I need to watch out for? I imagine some mild chest pain isn't a huge deal but I still want other's opinions.

Honestly, though, I feel like I'm at a point in my life where I'm OK sacrificing the health of my heart for some mental relief, for once. Kind of sad, I guess?

1jfz0s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jfz0s6/my_sil_is_driving_me_insane/,My SIL is driving me insane,"So I don‚Äôt know where to even begin. I live with my mother and recently my brother and his wife moved in back home with us. My brother is 21 and his wife just turned 20. I am about to be 26. She has always been kind to me.. but I‚Äôve been having some personal issues internally with her that I feel kinda crazy about but also she‚Äôs driving me nuts. So I‚Äôm in a relationship but not married, and accidentally got pregnant last year.. my SIL has been talking about wanting babies with my brother since she met him. Ok she‚Äôs a young adult in love and I admit my brother makes a great husband. She‚Äôs eager to start a family. Well my mom always despised the idea of any of us having babies since none of us are obviously ready. I had to break the news I was having a baby to my mom and family. My mom wasn‚Äôt that happy exactly happy at first, but accepted it was reality and was supportive overall after the initial shock. Only a couple months later, my brother and SIL announce they are pregnant too‚Ä¶ I knew right away she got jealous I had a baby and decided to have a baby also. I thought maybe I was slightly crazy but I just could sense it.. she wanted what I had. This was confirmed when she even admitted one day ‚ÄúI honestly was jealous when I found out you were pregnant at first until I got pregnant cause I‚Äôve been wanting a baby but was worried about your mom‚Äù ok I get that. I can‚Äôt be too mad because now my baby will have a close relative. But it was weird to me for her to admit to rushing into having a baby out of jealousy. Especially when they are so young and not in a place to have a baby.. my baby was an accident‚Ä¶ they ‚Äúplanned‚Äù theirs. Ok well fast forward to now us all having babies living with my mom‚Ä¶ she starts asking me ‚Äúwhere did you get that for your baby‚Äù about many things, ‚ÄúI want to get one too‚Äù and then proceeds to buy a lot of the same things I got for my baby. Ok fine, I get wanting to get things you see and like for your baby. Just was a little annoying for me when she‚Äôs buying the EXACT same things‚Ä¶ also I dyed my hair bright red. Then not long after, she ALSO dyes her hair bright red. Ok now I‚Äôm annoyed. It feels like she‚Äôs trying to be me‚Ä¶ my OTHER brother(not her husband) got me a cirkul cup. Not long after I start using it, she buys one too. I start going to a chiropractor and was telling them how I like my chiropractor a lot, now they are going to the same chiropractor. (I expected that I guess) if I get iced coffee, she will stare at it and the next day comes home with the same iced coffee. It‚Äôs all small things (minus the baby) but I feel like everything I do or buy she also not long after does and buys‚Ä¶ i know I‚Äôm older than her and she‚Äôs told me I‚Äôm pretty a few times when I get dressed up and she stares at me sometimes I can tell, so I guess maybe she kinda ‚Äúlooks up to me‚Äù but what bothers me is I don‚Äôt feel like someone she should look up to as I‚Äôm not the best life role model, and frankly it‚Äôs just driving me insane because it feels weird that everything I do she does or buys‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôm wrong for feeling this way but it‚Äôs honestly just annoying and I find myself disliking this about her. She even asks me random things like what brands I use or whatever and then she buys the same shampoo and stuff as me.. and even all that was fine except for the fact that I feel like she somewhat neglects her babies needs at times and now I feel guilty and sad for her baby cause I feel like her mom was too young and immature. But this also makes me feel judgemental and petty. Idk. And then we also share a lot of space together in the house, and my babie‚Äôs room is next to the living room and I‚Äôve asked for them to keep quiet when my baby has to sleep. This was fine until she was watching tv in the living room and her baby started scream crying like crazy and she was ignoring her babies cries, until my brother picked up the baby and tried to take her downstairs to their room. I overheard them in the other room arguing because my brother was going to take their baby downstairs out of respect to my sleeping baby, and my SIL got mad and argued with him and I heard ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt have to take her downstairs‚Äù and even though she‚Äôs always been nice to my face and copies me, I still had respect for her until I heard how little she cared to respect me and my sleeping baby. Also she offered to babysit for me one day as I needed a sitter last minute and I was kinda worried as I feel she somewhat neglects her baby, but I had no other option and was in a rush. I agreed, only to come home and find out she went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and my baby fell off the bed she placed her on and hit her head. I thought I was crazy for not trusting her fully in my mind and thinking she‚Äôs immature but now I‚Äôm starting to think from this maybe I‚Äôm not completely crazy. Last thing, my brother and SIL struggle with money management , I also struggle with this sometimes, I been trying to be better and had a carton of eggs in the fridge with my name written on them. I was trying to be frugal and not eat them all too fast. My brother and SIL got 2 dozen of their own eggs, but ate them so fast and ran out and then my SIL asked if she could have some of mine. I struggle to say no and felt bad so even though I was annoyed because I‚Äôm also struggling with money and can‚Äôt buy a lot of food, I said okay. And I just feel like I can‚Äôt have anything of my own. And I was annoyed because just because I didn‚Äôt eat all mine right away they feel entitled to my food. They‚Äôve also asked me for some of my food at other moments too when they didn‚Äôt have money to get more and I also didn‚Äôt have money to get more so I have just been frustrated because I try to save mine and can‚Äôt seem to when this happens if I do. I just am tired of feeling copied and not having anything just be mine. And she‚Äôs nice and caring to my face but seems to not actually respect me behind my back.. idk how to handle this.

About me: I am getting older. My body is not doing things it did when I was younger (recover).
I have been doing an overhaul in my lifestyle. 3 years ago was the start of it. Got into some trouble. A good thing comes out of it. 3 years sober. Found out about mental health and have been heavily involved. I'm taking medication, etc... Last year, I quit smoking. My body still cracks when I move, but I can move more than when I smoked. Physical health has become important, too. I have started seeing a doctor regularly. She told me I was pre-diabetic, so more changes. These past 6 months, I have stopped with most sugar except in my coffee, I don't want to try changing that yet. One day, I'll be caffeine free. That day is not today (not just yet). No pop, little juice. (Occasionally, I eat the damned ice cream my wife brings home even though I've asked her to stop. Don't tell me, though, I might get disappointed in myself) I stopped with semolina and other white flours, high sugar fruits like grapes or bananas, and high carb foods in general. Eat a ton more vegetables, less meat, a lot less red meat, and more peanut butter and apples. The huge problem is that I'm not creative in what I eat. I get extremely focused on other things. Some days are 3 meals of peanut butter and apple slices. The peanut butter is not sugarfied. No variety. Some where in this, I'm getting really gassy. Today is sulfuric, and I have no idea where it's coming from. It's awful. I ate some salad with some chopped ham and cheese for dinner last night. I'm not sure that it was enough to cause this reaction, though. I've tried doing some research on this, but it keeps pointing to nothing useful. I'm looking for some direction in dealing with it. I know a high vegetable diet can create more gas (doesn't smell nearly as bad as processed foods). Can the sulfur be cause by the amount of apples and peanut butter? If you have gas issues, how do you deal with it, whether it's sulfuric or just the increased amount? Or even though I have always been terrible with variety, if you have advise on systems you have put in to place to make sure you have variety, and/or ideas or trusted sites that can give me a list of easy healthy variety with regular ingredients. I'm not going out of my way to buy sesame oil and sesame seeds for something I'm only using once, so it just sits and takes room in my cupboards again, lol.

Written September 6, 2020

How many times have you cried this year? Could we narrow it down more and ask, how many times have you cried this week? How about today, have you shed any tears?

There are too many reasons that we could have found ourselves with tears in our eyes this year. Sadly, there were many preventable instances. And there were also some that were out of our hands. Either way, if we‚Äôre not taking our mental health into consideration, we might experience micro-PTSD bursts in the future as we continue to mentally process all the hardships that 2020 has brought us.

And what makes it worse, is the anxiety that many of us are facing as we try to catch a glimpse of what the future is going to look like. We stopped looking into the future because it often felt like the more we dreamed about how the following month would be better, the worse it actually turned out. 

So have we reached the peak of the year yet, or is that still to come?

Unfortunately, I think the next few months leading up to November 3 will be as equally disappointing as the first nine-months of the year, but I‚Äôm actually hopeful about what has yet to be exposed in this country.

For the first time in decades, all of America is in pain. And this pain actually has the power to pull us together as a nation. But don‚Äôt be mistaken, our future is not going to look anything like our past, and that‚Äôs the beauty of it.

We have to quit pushing the envelope of fear and instead need to push towards hopefulness. We need to keep rolling with the punches and we need to continue to equally take action in response.

If you‚Äôve learned anything about yourself this year, I hope it‚Äôs that you have one or more misconceptions about equality, racial justice, feminism, environmentalism, capitalism and healthcare. And I hope you‚Äôve learned not to settle.

Are we going to continue to settle for the standards that are placed upon us or are we going to take charge and demand more for our lives and for future generations? 

Although I‚Äôm scared about what the future holds, I also have a tinge of hope. And I‚Äôve never been more sure of it than now.

Let me tell you, back in 2015, I wasn‚Äôt vocal about what was around the corner with the election because like most people, I was convinced that there was no way that Trump could be president. So much so that I didn‚Äôt even vote. Not because I didn‚Äôt want to, but because I was living in South Africa and it felt like too much of a hassle. And now, look where we are. 

Were you complacent in the last election? Have you already written off this year‚Äôs election? 

I understand that it can seem like the last three years of Trump‚Äôs presidency weren‚Äôt that bad, 2020 is here to serve as a wake up call. Do you really think that you can survive the shellshock of 2020 for four more years? 

I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôve been tired since 2015. I was so upset with the outcome of the 2016 elections that I was convinced I was going to leave South Africa and move back to the U.S. in order to become a prophet. Extreme, I know, but I was so convinced that the following four years were going to truly show how misconstrued our vision of America was and thought that I could help people see what we were in for. However, I felt like all I could do at that point was sit back and watch America go down the dark path that it had chosen. 

I gave up because I couldn‚Äôt see how I, as one person, was going to change a nation. I didn‚Äôt feel as though the hearts of the nation were ready for change.

I‚Äôm not going to let that happen this time around. 

‚ÄúOnly time will tell,‚Äù have been the words that have gotten me through the past few months, but this implies that I am going to let time define itself. I refuse to sit back and continue to passively let time define my life. All I can say now is, ‚ÄúWhat a time to be alive.‚Äù

Although I‚Äôve had a million reasons to cry tears of despair lately, especially when I start thinking about how this next election is already shaping up, my tears have only been tears of hope. 


Written November 6, 2024

Peace in abundance.
But‚Ä¶ in it, also complacency.

I‚Äôve been so thankful for the past four years of the Biden-Harris presidency.
Was it the most fruitful administration in terms of policy and presidential legacies?
Not in the least.

But‚Ä¶ it was a presidency that allowed us to rest and regain our strength. 

We had become acutely aware of the division in our country and Biden-Harris did what they could without being far-reaching or wildly problematic.
But‚Ä¶ they failed to meet people where they were at.

As we can now see, their mildness was seen as ‚Äúweakness‚Äù‚Ä¶

And now, his wildness is seen as our ‚Äústrength‚Äù.
How did we get back here?

We failed to meet people where they are at.
It wasn‚Äôt about what Trump has done in the past. 
It wasn‚Äôt about what Kamala‚Äôs hope is for the future.
He claims a landslide victory, and even if there was, the reality is that it was about the here and now, and people just wanted to be met where they were at. 

I hate that this is what it took.
But‚Ä¶ I feel reinvigorated.

There‚Äôs something in me that is screaming, ‚ÄúHold on to hope!‚Äù

The most consequential president stands to gain so much from yet another term.
But‚Ä¶ he will not gain my fear.
He will not take my resolve.
He will not win.

He‚Äôs got a new playbook, but he‚Äôs got the same tired agenda: Sow hate, protect himself and rip apart the fabric of America.

We ran on hope, empathy and equality.
But‚Ä¶ obviously that wasn‚Äôt enough.

People want to know what they stand to gain.
How beautiful it would have been if the country had instead voted on what others stand to lose.

Sadly‚Ä¶ we all stand to lose something under Trump.
We will lose lives and liberties.
We will move further away from our commonalities as a nation.
And we will fall.

I‚Äôm not going down without a fight.

He will not win. 


Written March 20, 2025

So which direction do we take the fight?
We meet people where they are at.

There is no more hoping that they can learn from their past or dream for their future, until we show them how to acknowledge the present.

People are hurt.
People are hurting.
People will continue to be hurt.

Some are well aware of all of the ways that they have been hurt.
Some don‚Äôt realize they are being hurt.
Some are still too disillusioned to believe that they too will be hurt. 

The sad reality, that I wholeheartedly believe, is that everyone stands to lose something from this presidency.
But‚Ä¶ nevertheless, we persist.

We will defend. We will transform. We will survive.

Some of us need to wake up and realize, we‚Äôre not dead yet.

The foxes have been caught in the henhouse.
And there‚Äôs not just one. 
There‚Äôs a whole system that allows them to prosper and take away what is ours. 
They‚Äôve invaded our safety and comfort.

But‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time to let them know that they‚Äôre not welcome anymore. 
They never have been.

It‚Äôs past time to speak up.
It‚Äôs past time to spend less.
It‚Äôs past time to love more.
It‚Äôs past time for us to stop allowing politics to divide us.

We must make an effort to change the seemingly predetermined fate of our nation. 

It‚Äôs time for a change and to catch up with the rest of the world.
It‚Äôs time for us to lead with our hearts rather than with our wallets.
It‚Äôs time to call out injustices and be righteously angry.
It‚Äôs time to let hope continue to lead the way.

I, for one, am tired of being a passive bystander.

These are some of the ways that I have been able to step into the revolution.
Everybody‚Äôs path looks different, but it‚Äôs about finding what works for you and committing to it.
Will you join me?

Speak Up. Shake off the fear of talking to others either over the phone, in a public space or in a private conversation. Brush off those old writings that you were too afraid to post, because your fragile ego couldn‚Äôt handle it. We have so much to lose, now is not the time to be fearful of speaking out. Your voice really can make the difference. Even if it‚Äôs just for one person, it‚Äôs worth it. Call your representatives. Stop fighting with others over the internet, and get out into the streets. 

Spend Less. Stop fueling the greed of corporations. Shop local, invest in your community, and do your research. Put your money towards those who are aligned in your beliefs and who have your interests in mind. Take a moment to take a look at what you‚Äôre putting into your body. Begin the detox process. Wean yourself off the coffee, the dairy, the wheat, the sugar, the alcohol. Your mind will begin to see things more clearly. 

Love More. We all need a little extra kindness and patience with each other right now. Actually, we need a lot of it. Many of us are scared out of our minds, have completely disassociated or don‚Äôt see the perils that lie ahead. We need to make more eye contact with each other. We need to see each other and meet each other where they are at. We all still deserve to experience a loving interaction with another person, in a world filled with so much anxiety and rage. 

Prepare. No matter what is ahead, have a plan. Whether it‚Äôs one to just get through the day, or one that will help you in literally surviving a week or longer when shit hits the fan. Get your emergency supplies together. Establish a safe spot. Do something that will help you feel ready for action or survival.

The world is watching us.
We need to do this for ourselves, and we need to do this for each other.
We need to fight in ways that we have been too lazy to see through.

It‚Äôs not enough to be angry.
It‚Äôs not enough to be afraid.
Put your money where your mouth is.
No more empty words.
No more passive hope.

If you‚Äôre waiting for someone else to fight this battle, you‚Äôve already lost.
If you think we have more time, you‚Äôre wrong.
If you think you don't have the power, you‚Äôre lying to yourself.
There is no more waiting. There is only action.

1jfyrkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jfyrkf/the_price_of_suffering/,The Price of Suffering,"The road to the cabin was older than I was.

A narrow strip of dirt, carved between towering pines, the kind of road that never stayed tame. Every year, Dad would clear the worst of the overgrowth, smooth out the deeper ruts, and scatter fresh gravel where he could‚Äîbut the forest always took it back. The woods had a way of reclaiming what belonged to them. Now, with him gone, it felt like we were trespassing.

‚ÄúYou sure this is the right way?‚Äù Ryan asked, peering through the windshield.

The trees pressed in close, their skeletal limbs arching over the road like fingers reaching for something just out of grasp. The truck‚Äôs headlights carved out brief tunnels of visibility before the darkness swallowed everything whole again.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt just looks different.‚Äù

Ryan exhaled through his nose, shifting in his seat. ""Dad used to say you could blindfold him, drop him anywhere in these woods, and he'd still find his way back to the cabin.""

I didn‚Äôt answer.

I‚Äôd heard that a hundred times, usually from Dad himself, grinning over a campfire. You could walk these woods in the dark if you knew them well enough. Sometimes the stories changed‚Äîsometimes it was Grandpa who built the place, sometimes it was his father before him‚Äîbut the core remained. This land had been in our family for generations. Dad had grown up here. His father before him.

And yet, for the first time in my life, I struggled to recognize the road.

The woods felt different this year.

Thicker.

Hungrier.

I tightened my grip on the wheel. The forest didn‚Äôt change. People did.

The truck jolted as we hit a deep pothole, and Ryan cursed, bracing himself against the door. ‚ÄúJesus, man. Suspension‚Äôs not that good.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could always walk.‚Äù

‚ÄúFunny.‚Äù He glanced at his phone, but the screen showed nothing but a spinning wheel of failure. No signal. ‚ÄúThis place is a black hole.‚Äù

I let out a dry chuckle. ‚ÄúYou act like this is new.‚Äù

Ryan had always been different from me‚Äîthe type to complain about no Wi-Fi and keep the outdoors at arm‚Äôs length. He wasn‚Äôt a bad hunter‚Äîhe could shoot just fine‚Äîbut he‚Äôd never loved the woods the way Dad had. The way I did.

He adjusted his ball cap, frowning at the dark tree line. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember it getting dark this early.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the cloud cover,‚Äù I said. The sky had been gray since noon, thick with the promise of rain. It should have bothered me more than it did. The world felt dimmer out here as if the sun didn‚Äôt touch this place the same way it touched everywhere else.

The last bend in the road came up fast, revealing the cabin as we cleared the trees. A dark silhouette nestled in the clearing, untouched by time. The porch sagged a little more than I remembered, but otherwise, it was exactly as Dad had left it.

I let out a breath I hadn‚Äôt realized I was holding. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here.‚Äù

Ryan made a face. ‚ÄúCozy.‚Äù

I ignored him, throwing the truck into park and stepping onto the gravel drive. The air hit me first‚Äîcool and damp, laced with the familiar scent of wet leaves and pine. The ground was soft, with fallen foliage and dead leaves crunching underfoot as I approached the porch.

Ryan lingered by the truck, stuffing his hands into his jacket pockets. ‚ÄúYou ever think about selling it?‚Äù

I stopped at the bottom of the steps. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

He hesitated. ‚ÄúMom mentioned it.‚Äù

I turned to look at him, my jaw tightening. ‚ÄúI said no.‚Äù

Ryan sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. ‚ÄúAlright, man. Forget I asked.‚Äù

I exhaled slowly, pushing the door open. The hinges groaned, the air inside thick with dust and the ghosts of old campfires.

It smelled like home.

Ryan flicked on a flashlight, the beam cutting across the room. Everything was just as we‚Äôd left it last winter‚Äîhunting rifles mounted over the stone fireplace, old maps pinned to the walls, the couch covered in a faded quilt Mom had sewn years ago. The woodstove sat cold in the corner, logs stacked neatly beside it, waiting for hands that hadn‚Äôt returned.

‚ÄúFeels weird without him, huh?‚Äù Ryan said, softer this time.

I swallowed against the tightness in my throat. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

Silence settled between us, heavy and unspoken.

Ryan exhaled, rubbing his hands together. ‚ÄúAlright, I say we drink in honor of the old man. Then we start the fire before we freeze to death.‚Äù

I managed a half-smile. ‚ÄúSounds like a plan.‚Äù



We built the fire outside like we always had.

The wood burned low, glowing embers casting flickering shadows over the clearing. The whiskey was cheap, but it burned just fine, warming us from the inside out as we passed the bottle between us.

‚ÄúYou hear that?‚Äù Ryan asked suddenly.

I frowned. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Ryan cocked his head, listening. ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù

I realized he was right. The forest had gone silent.

No crickets. No rustling in the brush. No distant hoot of an owl. Just the fire and our own breathing.

The hair on the back of my neck stood on end.

Then, from deep in the woods, something howled.

It wasn‚Äôt a wolf.

It wasn‚Äôt a coyote.

It was deeper. Resonant.

Ryan tensed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not normal.‚Äù

I licked my lips, watching the tree line. The sound was distant, almost distorted as if coming from somewhere much farther away‚Äîbut reaching us all the same.

Then, just as suddenly, the fire dimmed.

Not from the wind. Not from anything natural.

The flames shrank, flickered, and then guttered low as if something unseen was pressing against them.

Ryan‚Äôs hand went to the knife at his belt. ‚ÄúLuke‚Ä¶‚Äù

Then, the woods exhaled.

The sound returned all at once‚Äîthe rustling of leaves, the whisper of the trees, the distant chirp of crickets. The fire surged back to life, crackling bright and whole again.

Like nothing had happened.

Ryan let out a slow breath. ‚ÄúYou wanna tell me what the hell that was?‚Äù

I stared at the darkened forest, my jaw tight.

Somewhere out there, something had been watching.

I could feel it.

I just didn‚Äôt know what.

-----------------------------------------------

The woods were different in the morning.

They always were.

Last night‚Äôs fire had burned down to a pile of pale ash, the empty whiskey bottle beside it. The trees, which had felt vast and unknowable in the dark, now stretched upward like ancient pillars, their canopies breaking apart the gray sky above.

I stood on the porch, rifle slung over my shoulder, breathing in the crisp morning air. Everything smelled damp‚Äîearthy, fresh, but oddly still. The kind of silence that felt placed rather than natural.

Behind me, Ryan shuffled out of the cabin, rubbing sleep from his eyes. ‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù

I held up my thermos. ‚ÄúAlready made.‚Äù

He groaned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a menace.‚Äù

I smirked, taking a sip. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre slow.‚Äù

He grumbled something under his breath, then flopped onto one of the porch chairs, staring out at the tree line. ‚ÄúWe heading out soon?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Figured we‚Äôd set up by the creek. Always good tracking there.‚Äù

Ryan exhaled, rubbing a hand over his face. ‚ÄúMan, I still can‚Äôt stop thinking about last night. That‚Ä¶ sound.‚Äù

I stayed quiet.

‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt sound like a coyote,‚Äù he said, glancing at me. ‚ÄúOr a wolf.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Ryan frowned. ‚ÄúThen what?‚Äù

I took another sip of coffee. ‚ÄúDunno.‚Äù

That was a lie. I did know. Or at least, I had an idea.

Something had been out there last night. Something that had watched us from the trees pressed itself against the edges of the firelight, just beyond where we could see. I‚Äôd felt it. That awful, dragging weight in my gut.

But I wasn‚Äôt about to say that to Ryan.

He pushed himself up, stretching. ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs get going before I change my mind.‚Äù



The forest was quiet.

Not in the way it should‚Äôve been.

No rustling leaves. No squirrels darting through the underbrush. No birds calling overhead. Just the sound of our boots pressing into damp earth and the soft, distant murmur of the creek.

Ryan noticed it, too. He kept glancing up, brows furrowed, like he expected something to move between the trees.

‚ÄúFeels dead,‚Äù he muttered.

I nodded. ‚ÄúToo quiet.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt normal. Even in colder months, the forest had life. But here, now? It was like everything had left. Or worse‚Äîlike it had been driven away.

We walked on, rifles in hand, eyes scanning the trees. A thin mist curled between the trunks, soft, almost lazy. It wasn‚Äôt unusual for the mornings to be foggy this time of year, but it felt‚Ä¶ off.

Too still. Too heavy.

Then I saw it.

A deer stood just beyond the clearing ahead. A buck, tall and unmoving, its body partially hidden in the fog.

Something about it made my stomach turn.

Ryan stopped beside me. ‚ÄúYou see that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

The buck didn‚Äôt move.

Its antlers curled high above its head, but they looked wrong. Jagged. Almost too thick for its skull.

I lifted my rifle, peering through the scope.

Then my breath hitched.

Its throat was slit.

Not fresh‚Äîdark, dried blood matted its fur, a gaping wound stretching from ear to chest.

But the deer was still standing.

I dropped the rifle, blinking hard.

Gone.

The clearing was empty.

I sucked in a slow breath. ‚ÄúDid you‚Äî?‚Äù

Ryan shook his head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna talk about it.‚Äù



By mid-afternoon, the mist hadn‚Äôt lifted.

It should‚Äôve. The sun had been up for hours, but the fog clung to the trees, curling around their trunks like something living.

Ryan had gone quiet. He kept his rifle close, eyes flicking between the trees like he expected something to jump out. I didn‚Äôt blame him.

Neither of us had spoken about the deer that wasn‚Äôt there.

We were headed back to the cabin when we heard it.

A horn.

Deep. Resonant.

A single, drawn-out note carried through the mist.

I stopped in my tracks. My breath caught in my throat.

Ryan turned to me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt real. Right?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer.

The sound had come from deep in the woods. Too far for a hunter. Too old to be from anything modern.

Then, from somewhere much closer, the hounds began to bay.



We ran.

Not in a panicked sprint‚Äîbut fast enough to get out.

The cabin wasn‚Äôt far. If we kept moving, we‚Äôd be fine. We just had to‚Äî

Ryan wasn‚Äôt there.

I skidded to a stop, breath coming fast. The mist had thickened. I turned in a circle.

‚ÄúRyan?‚Äù

Nothing.

My pulse hammered.

‚ÄúRyan!‚Äù

The trees loomed, their dark forms swallowed by the fog. The forest held its breath.

Then, just ahead, I saw him.

A figure, standing partially hidden between the trees.

I exhaled hard, moving toward him. ‚ÄúJesus, Ryan, don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

I stopped.

It wasn‚Äôt him.

The figure was too tall, too broad. Wrapped in old hunting leathers, shadowed under a hood.

He didn‚Äôt move.

I swallowed hard, gripping my rifle.

The Huntsman.

He stood still as death, watching.

The hounds were close now. Their howls wove through the trees, circling, tightening.

The Huntsman raised a hand.

He pointed.

Straight at me.

My breath turned shallow. My legs refused to move.

Then, from behind me‚Äî

‚ÄúLuke.‚Äù

Ryan‚Äôs voice.

I turned. He stood there, breathless, wide-eyed. ‚ÄúWe need to go.‚Äù

I turned back toward the clearing.

Empty.

The Huntsman was gone.



We didn‚Äôt talk on the way back.

When we finally reached the porch, Ryan turned to me. His face was pale.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

I shook my head, trying to steady my breathing. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Ryan‚Äôs jaw tightened. He turned, staring out at the trees. The mist was fading now.

The hunt was over.

For now.

I stepped inside, locking the door behind me. But deep in my gut, I knew‚Äî

A locked door wouldn‚Äôt stop him.

-----------------------------------------------

The wind shifted.

I felt it before I heard anything‚Äîthe air growing heavier, pressing against my skin like something tangible. The trees, so silent before, seemed to hold their breath.

Ryan stood beside me on the porch, his jaw clenched. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs coming.‚Äù

I swallowed, fingers tightening around my rifle.

We both knew.

The fire had burned out, but I still smelled smoke, charred wood, and something more profound‚Äîearthy, like damp fur and rot.

The Huntsman was near.

Ryan exhaled, shoulders stiff. ‚ÄúDo you think‚Äî‚Äù

The sound cut him off.

A hunting horn, deep and ancient, echoed through the trees.

The baying followed, rolling through the mist in waves.

The hounds had found their prey.

Ryan turned to me. His voice was low. Resigned. ‚ÄúYou should go inside.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

His face was pale, but he gave me a weak smile. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think you would.‚Äù

The mist swallowed the tree line, curling toward the cabin like fingers reaching through the dark.

And then‚Äîthey stepped through.

First, the hounds.

They weren‚Äôt dogs. Not really. Their bodies were too lean, too long, their movements too fluid, too human. Their eyes‚Äîthey weren‚Äôt animal eyes.

I sucked in a breath.

They were human eyes.

One hound had a scar running down its throat like it had been slit. Another was missing an eye, the socket raw and red.

The realization settled, thick and awful.

These weren‚Äôt just hounds.

They were past souls.

Hunters. Men. People who had been judged.

Ryan stared at them, breath shallow. ‚ÄúJesus.‚Äù

And then, the Huntsman stepped forward.



He loomed over us, broad and impossibly still. His leathers were worn, stitched together from things that had never belonged to man. His hood was low, shadowing his face.

But then he lifted his head.

My breath caught.

His face was withered, mummified, like something long dead and preserved in the cold. His features were sunken, lips curled back over blackened teeth.

When he exhaled, his breath met the cold air, curling in wisps of steam.

The sound wasn‚Äôt human.

It was like the forest itself was breathing.

My hands shook.

Ryan was staring. Not in fear‚Äîin understanding.

The Huntsman raised a gloved hand.

And he pointed to Ryan.



Ryan let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúI get it now.‚Äù

I turned to him, my pulse hammering. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt look at me. His gaze was locked on the Huntsman. On the hound with the slit throat.

Ryan‚Äôs voice was hoarse. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of the deer.‚Äù

My blood ran cold.

‚ÄúThe one we saw,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúThe one that wasn‚Äôt there.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúRyan, what are you talking about?‚Äù

He finally looked at me, his expression unreadable.

‚ÄúDad and I went hunting when I was younger,‚Äù he said. His voice was distant like he was watching the memory play out. ‚ÄúWe shot a deer, but it didn‚Äôt die right away. It was suffering. I‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I slit its throat.‚Äù

His breath hitched. ‚ÄúBut it didn‚Äôt die right away. It still struggled. It still suffered.‚Äù

I felt sick.

Ryan exhaled. ‚ÄúThis is my judgment, Luke. I‚Äî‚Äù

The hounds shifted. The Huntsman stepped forward.

Ryan‚Äôs voice cracked. ‚ÄúI think I have to go.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù My voice came out raw. ‚ÄúNo, we can fix this. We can‚Äî‚Äù

I turned to the Huntsman. ‚ÄúTake me instead.‚Äù

The Huntsman didn‚Äôt move.

I clenched my fists. ‚ÄúYou hear me? Take me instead!‚Äù

Still, he said nothing.

Because he didn‚Äôt have to.

This had never been a negotiation.

The horn blew again.

Ryan stepped forward. His hands were shaking, but he kept his head high. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Luke.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I choked.

He gave me a small, sad smile. ‚ÄúYou were always the better hunter anyway.‚Äù

I watched, helpless, as he crossed the threshold into the mist.

The hounds closed in.

And then, he was gone.



I stood there for a long time.

The forest felt empty now.

The Huntsman had vanished, his hounds with him. The trees stood silent and unyielding. The air was still.

Ryan was gone.

Forever.

I turned, walking back inside the cabin. My hands were cold. My chest was empty.

The rifle sat against the wall.

Waiting.

I stared at it for a long time.

And then I took it, stepped back outside, and walked into the trees.



The forest was dark.

The mist had begun to roll back in, swirling between the trees. I moved forward, slow and steady.

And then I saw it.

A deer stood ahead of me. A buck, tall and unmoving, its body partially hidden in the fog.

It didn‚Äôt run.

It watched me.

I lifted the rifle and aimed. My hands didn‚Äôt shake.

I fired.

The deer staggered, but it didn‚Äôt fall. Blood darkened its side, but it was still standing.

I let the rifle lower.

The wound would kill it, eventually. It would suffer first. And that was enough.

A shape moved at the edge of the trees.

A hound stepped into view.

It didn‚Äôt move.

I exhaled, my breath curling in the cold air.

I knew what it was.

I knew who it was.

Ryan.

He watched me, silent, waiting.

I closed my eyes.

I was always his big brother.

It was my job to protect him.

And since I couldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶

1jfymm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1jfymm1/rant_abt_starbies_in_a_qfc/,rant abt starbies in a qfc,"just a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù rant rq. i work at a starbucks inside of a QFC in Seattle. 

when i started here, the manager was actually shifting over to being a manager in the bakery and we had 6 staff total i believe? but then one quit, 2 of them only work 2 days of the week, or one day, or sometimes they dont work for like 3 weeks. and then the manager left so that left just basically 2 of us working full time. i let them know early on though that i would need to cut my days down once we hired more people since im in cosmetology school and i go to school every single night and then have to go sleep for a couple hours then get right back up to open at 5:30 in the morning. so doing that and school 5 days a week along with 10 hours of online schoolwork im required to do every single week along with 20 hours in school was not going to work i was literally starting to crashout.

sooo basically it was me and one other guy running it. the other 2 that barely worked still barely work. and then we decided to hire 3 more staff! great!! 

heres the kicker.. THEY ALL WANT TO WORK LIKE 2 DAYS A WEEK‚Ä¶

listen QFC managers.. I AM SO SICKKK OF THISSSS

one girl she only works like 2 days a week? at best? only closing or mid shift sometimes? my manager told me shes a college student and thats why she has less days. oh cool alright i get it‚Ä¶ me too though?? then i asked her what school she goes to.. oh she just does online classes? that she can basically do at any time??? 

OH MY GODDDDDD anyways yall can hate on me for this one irdc if im being selfish or whatever you want to call it its just so pointless in my eyes to come in and work 1-2 days at best or if you just don‚Äôt work for weeks at a time. 

the other girl she said she only wants 4 days a week.. thats fine. but i have seniority and since we have hired new staff i will be cutting my days down. not my issue. so shes been basically opening when i cannot. dont mind her at all really she isnt the issue and has previous experience working in coffee shops.

the other guy? hes a college student and only wants to work 3 days.. and closing only basically. 

then theres the guy who started working a week before i started. and hes now the new manager. i got offered the position but i declined. cause im not trying to add more stress to my life when it‚Äôs already chaotic enough. he takes every mid shift he can and refuses to give it up to anyone else. i would honestly take on more days if i could work a mid instead because that would give me more sleep at night and ive explained that too. but he has seniority so he picks his days before me and he takes every mid shift possible. 

my other issue is the fact that QFC believes we should only have ONE staff opening, ONE staff as a mid, and ONE staff closing‚Ä¶ my guy.. NO?!! this is stupid. i get it‚Äôs a small kiosk, but i literally stopped by the other QFC with a starbucks nearby and they no joke had 4 staff there and it was still an opening shift.. like please i wishhhhhüò´ i get rushes constantly while being an opener and it would be 1000% faster if i had another staff to help or even if we got an extra espresso machine?? we only have one and if i have 10 drinks lined out and majority are drinks that have espresso in them or steamed milk.. i cannot get these drinks out fast enough like we should be. 

anyways thats it idk if anyone else can relate im sure ill be shitted on for the whole issue with the online class girl but whatever. she likes to stick her hands in peoples drinks anyways to move the ice??? (it was corrected but you would expect that to be common knowledge NOT TO DO‚Ä¶ü§¢) then some of the other staff seriously just don‚Äôt know how to look at the recipe cards cause how come college boy makes me an iced oatmilk shaken espresso but doesn‚Äôt put any oatmilk in it and gives me straight espresso shots.. and no brown sugar either‚Ä¶ 

also my manager doesn‚Äôt actually take the time to ACTUALLY train them because he could care less and just wants to get them certified faster he‚Äôs pretty much said so to my face soooo.. anyways end rant. i‚Äôll be looking at other coffee shops in the near future i‚Äôm sure lmaooo",6,1742502230.0,starbucksbaristas,3,1.0,False

My husband, who is currently in med school, was hesitant. It didn‚Äôt fit into the picture he had in his head for us, and that led to a clash of perspectives. The conversation didn‚Äôt escalate to anything nasty, but it became heated, and he ran to the room crying. I followed him, trying to comfort him, telling him I loved him and I was sorry. I stayed with him, held him, and gave him some space. I made him breakfast, but he just remained distant. We both became avoidant after that.

In a moment of frustration, I made a hurtful comment. I said, ‚ÄúLeave your ring at home, why even wear it if you don‚Äôt care about me?‚Äù He got really upset and went to get my ring, hiding it. I was about to leave for a one-week girls‚Äô trip the next day, and the tension was unbearable. In retaliation, I took his phone and demanded my ring back. He refused, asking for his phone, but I refused to give it to him. When I saw him coming toward me to physically take the phone, I yelled ‚ÄúStop, stop!‚Äù I ran to the bedroom, hid under the sheets, and he came in and physically retrieved the phone from my pocket. I was still yelling, and I started crying. He asked, ‚ÄúWhy are you crying?‚Äù I wailed, ‚ÄúLeave me alone!‚Äù He responded, ‚ÄúAs you wish,‚Äù and left.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I was overwhelmed with emotion and ran to the bathroom, where I started throwing up‚Äîlikely a panic attack. I was crying on the bathroom floor while he heard me from the outside. I needed fresh air, so I ran outside, but I didn‚Äôt have the keys to get back in. When I returned, he asked how I got in, but instead of asking if I was okay, he was upset I told him to leave me alone.

The next morning, I packed up my things‚Äîalone‚Äîwhile he went back to bed. It was 6 a.m., and I had to prepare for my trip. We barely spoke. He left for school while I slept, and without seeing each other, I left for my trip.

The whole time I was away, we were still on bad terms. A day after I arrived, we had a small argument over text. In the heat of the moment, I sent him a message that said, ‚ÄúI hope you fail your presentation like you failed me.‚Äù Immediately after sending it, I regretted it and deleted it, but he saw it and then blocked my number. I tried reaching him through another platform, but he was responding less and less. Another day passed, and we only communicated via email about something administrative I needed.

The real issue started when I got a follow request from a girl who went to his med school. I had no idea who she was, so I emailed him asking, ‚ÄúDo you know her?‚Äù He ignored my question. I followed up, ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù Again, he didn‚Äôt respond. My anxiety grew, and I asked on another social platform. He finally replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you, I promise. But right now, I‚Äôm really overwhelmed, and I don‚Äôt feel good. Please, if you have even a shred of love or care, give me some leniency.‚Äù I responded with silence. He continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not having any relationships. Please, why are you doing this to me? I‚Äôm begging. I told you how I feel, and this is your response. I wish you the best.‚Äù

I then asked, ‚ÄúBegging for what? To buy time to come up with a coherent plot about why this random woman you know is following me? Are you really overwhelmed with what? Hiding secrets?‚Äù He responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hiding anything. You can ask her whatever you want. I met her for the first time today at my event, and I gave her your Instagram. I never hide secrets. You‚Äôre being so mean to me.‚Äù I snapped back, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to be shocked when she sees the ‚ÄòDo I know you?‚Äô text. I can‚Äôt believe my spouse can‚Äôt even tell me about this.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when he called me, crying, saying he couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. He told me not to come home and that he didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me. He said, ‚ÄúStay where you are, I never want you back here. You‚Äôre not allowed to come back.‚Äù I tried calling him, but he told me he didn‚Äôt want to hear my voice. Over and over, I apologized, telling him how sorry I was. I told him I loved him, but he lashed out. He called me the most spiteful person he‚Äôs ever met, an abomination, and said that for a woman who looked sweet, I was the furthest thing from it. He said I was a cruel person, the most heartless person he‚Äôs ever met.

He then sent me a picture of us on a beautiful date where he had edited himself out. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that?‚Äù he asked. I was left devastated.

I begged him to tell me if he was filing for divorce or if I should start looking for lawyers. He said no. He blocked me everywhere and told me he needed to be away from me. We stopped talking completely after that.

Contextual Notes: We haven‚Äôt been married for long, and in the first few months of our marriage, he deleted texts about a coffee chat he had. He also hid his financial struggles from me. He went into debt, took money out behind my back, and lost it all gambling, all without telling me. It left me dealing with emotional infidelity and severe financial betrayal. I couldn‚Äôt trust him with anything after that. Every time I questioned him about the money, he promised me he wasn‚Äôt hiding anything. How could I believe him?

I know this may sound harsh, and he‚Äôs called me every name in the book. But it‚Äôs really not that hard to say, ‚ÄúHey, I met a girl today and gave her your Instagram.‚Äù It only took her two minutes to DM me, introducing herself and explaining how she met him. This behavior has been a trend for two years now: leaving me in the dark, as though I‚Äôm not worth being involved in decisions, or hiding things from me for my own ‚Äúprotection‚Äù as he puts it. But I‚Äôm done protecting myself from this anymore. If you've watched the most recent season of LIB, think devin and virginia - how he would just not tell her things, like how they were given a $1k cheque and he just never brought it up to her. My husbands been like this for so long untill it all blew up with the financial infedelity. 

Please, I need help understanding this. I‚Äôd appreciate any thoughts or insights. I just don't know what to do. We promised that we wouldn threaten divorce. I love this man so much and I know he loved me. But man I have gone through hell and back with this guy. Not to mention, some of the things he said where basically throwing back in my face things I told him in complete vulnerability, and he used them against me as attacks too.

The research we're seeing recently is a lot more disturbing. Brains opened after death being found with grams of plastic, testicles being found to accumulate plastic. Plastics are constantly laced with and made from awful ingredients; the rabbit hole on BPA is depressing, and the ingredient that replaced BPA in ""BPA free"" stuff is likely just as bad and just less well studied. I won't go into detail here‚Äìif you're curious, it's worth digging more into, but that's not the point today.

I have been cutting plastics out of my life in various ways. I no longer take hot liquids in to-go containers (soup, curry, coffee‚Äìthe ""paper"" containers are all plastic lined and hot liquids leech it). I cut open my tea bags I have and use a metal strainer, and will start only buying loose leaf.

But another major source is the dust we breathe in, which is made up of a lot of micro plastics. Everything plastic in our environment slowly degreased and gets crushed down. And this is a major source of how micro plastics reach our brain.

Switching to cotton sheets, buying a leather couch off of FB marketplace, etc...

But man. No-gi, all of our clothes are made of plastic. 

We've kind of accepted plastic sportswear as the norm altogether, it isn't just jiu jitsu. I remember when under armor became a huge thing when I was a kid and kind of seemed to kick off this trend, at least that's how it seems in my memory.

Is anyone making non-plastic jiu jitsu no-gi apparel? I know the stretchy tight fight is nice and what we're used to. I don't know that can really be immitated without synthetic (plastic) materials.

This is saying nothing of the fact that our mats are all plastic too, I guess. 

I don't freak out about it and try to go 100%, but I'm just trying to make the changes that I can. Was curious if anyone else has thought of this. Wondering if just wearing cotton shorts and a cotton T-shirt might be the way to go. Kids these days probably don't know, but ince upon a time that's what was normal, when people would roll around in their garage after watching UFC 1 and with no BJJ gyms available around them.

 Hope you‚Äôre all having a good day ü´∂üèª",1,1742501604.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False

I just give it a couple quick pulses to stir my coffee without making bubbles. Could I use one of these while making bottles, assuming it‚Äôs just long enough to stir the formula without frothing it? We‚Äôre planning to use Dr. Brown‚Äôs bottles if that makes a difference for the air bubbles risk. Thanks for weighing in! :) ",1,1742501538.0,FormulaFeeders,13,1.0,False
